3,Updated 2nd Edition Now Available,"A completely rewritten and enormously improved second edition of The Everything Pregnancy Book is now available. The new book is by Paula Ford-Martin, with Dr. Elisabeth Aron, and is available on Amazon."
1,Check everything out with your doctor,"I was very disappointed with the book and found that a lot of the information was completely contradictory to advice from my doctor and mid-wife. Of course, when pregnant, you should always check info out with your doctor, but of all the literature I have read, the advice in this book was most often out of sync with the other literature and professional advice I received."
5,Baseball Days brings back the memories,"This was an excellent book, nostalgic of the little league days of my hometown. I highly recomend it!"
4,Baseball Days,"While remembering the childhood innocence that has left so many of us behind, this book reflects the simple joys of the great American pastime, playing baseball. I highly recommend the reading of this book for a sure source of entertainment."
5,Wonderful Book,"This is one of my favorite books. I often reread it. It is pretty heavy, but is filled with practical ways of looking at life whether you are young, in mid-life or late-life. I loved the wholistic view that the author has on wellness - physical, emotional and spiritual. It gave me a whole new way of looking at life now and in my so-called ""retirement"" years."
4,Hoyle Classic Solitaire,"My Hoyle Classic Solitaire was fun up to a point, but then the availability of new cards to draw was prematurely depleted. That was on the Yukon or Klondike version of solitaire. Anyway, it was the only version of solitaire that I've played for years. I know it was a glitch, but it took the fun out of it, and I haven't wanted to play with it since. Maybe I'll try some of the other versions on that CD, but I hate that the very game I want to play doesn't work properly. I thought that because it had the Hoyle name, it would be the best, but I now know they aren't the ones who made the software."
1,"T-Fal, Too small!","I don't know what type of ruler they use to advertize this pan as 10 1/4 inches. We bought it because our existing T-Fal pan was worn out, and we wanted to keep using the lids that were common to it and other pans. This thing measures only 9 7/8 on the outside edges. Inflation??"
3,T-Fal saute pan,It was ok. I was a little disappointed that the color was a dull red and not cherry red like it showed.
1,AWFUL!,"This is the 4th worse song to be put out in 2006. Seriously, this is awful. Very juvenile and materialistic. This guy and his rented chains need to disapear. What a waste!"
3,Worth the 1.99,"It would be nice if they had a remix or two on this disc, but that is not the case. Instrumental is nice for budding rappers to try to use I suppose, but I really only got this disc to bump me into the free shipping category!"
4,Handy & Helpful,This handy little pocket book was a gift from my husband &has proved invaluable particularly while grocery shopping andrestaurant dining. I keep it in my purse for quick reference & many of my co-workers are now borrowing it during the day to see what they're eating. A great little book!
1,You don't really need it...,"I ordered this along with the Lifespan Book. If you follow that program, they tell which foods you can eat throughout the day. You are not supposed to count carb grams. I have only opened this book twice. I only opened it the second time to search for a reason to use it... I didn't find one."
2,Questions,"I am impressed with the diet concept and would say that it will work for me. The only problem is what do I do for all the carbohydrate bread substitutes when I am egg sensitive. I cannot bake the muffins etc and cannot eat all the omlets etc. This makes it very difficult. There is no where to ask these questions, which is why I have crashed in on this 'Review' section. Forgive me, but I would appreciate some help if possible. Thanks."
1,Another book suggestion...,"Don't waste your money on this one. Get ""Food for Life"", by Neal Barnard. It changed my life! I lost 55pounds five years ago, and I've still kept it off! I will never go back to my old way of eating. The best part of this ""lifestyle"" change is that you can eat a lot and still lose. And yes, you can eat carbs--lots of them. Trust me, carbs do not make you fat!"
1,Didn't work!,Brought this because it contained the same ingredients in a famous product that is suppose to give you a lot of energy. The price was right. But no energy! Sent back!
3,lacks technical content,"Like two other reviewers, I also found a lack of substantive technical content. The book does delve into great detail about the ATAM process, down to listing the various roles like timekeeper and questioner, and their responsibilities. Fair enough. And for this, there is indeed plenty of content for setting up and running the process.But try as I might, I could not get a firm grasp on how to actually choose between two [or more] software architectures. The technical examples cited in the text were invariably too skimpy for serious consideration. Perhaps the book would be enhanced by several solid, detailed examples and how to choose in those examples."
3,so so,"yes it dives into the events leading up to the killing of john lennon and looks into what happens to the S.O.B. after that night,but I personally thought ""Chapter 27"" was better."
1,Doesn't play and can't contact the seller,I never had the fortune or misfortune to watch this movie because it won't play and I can't contact the seller.
5,Great Product,"This item is too good. Even my 4 yrs old knew how to asemble it. There were 2 flying hopters, one with 27Mhz and another 49Mhz. The 27Mhz was a little less powerfull, but for the price it is worth. The charging time is 15-20 mins and usage is around 30 mins after that you need to recharge it."
2,Locks up on mp3 discs,"I bought this player from Best Buy. I tested DVDs, CDs, music CD-Rs, and mp3 CD-Rs. All worked fine initially. Two days later preparing for a Christmas Party, the player locked up after inserting the mp3 CD-Rs. The player normally shows a screen where you can see the folders and files. It locked on the background for this screen. I had to disconnet the power cord to the unit, and re-connect in order to retrieve the disc. The other types of media still play fine. I will be returning the unit for a different model/brand."
2,Please don't do it.,I picked up the Samsung DVD-P241 on 11-26-04(blackfriday sale)Got it home and set up was easy.I placed Harry Potter PoA and it started Buzzing (loudly)then it told me check disk so i got a new cd and got the same massage.Back it go's today !!!!!
4,Good buy...... didn't last forever though,"This DVD player worked very well. Didn't care for the Fast Forward, but I did get used to it.I write this with actual knowledge, since I used the product for 4 years before it finally died. I definitely feel I got my money's worth."
1,Broke after 1 time use,"I got this dvd player for my mother as a Christmas gift. She played one movie on it, and after that, it never worked again. Completely dead. I will be returning it for another make and model. Stay away!!!"
1,out of stock???,"I ordered this item and i was charged on the same day but it took amazon a whole month to let me know that it was out of stock. that whole time i was waiting for it was a waste. they did give me a complete refund, which was expected. but if you try to get this item please make sure they have it in stock first."
2,Looking for a replacement,"Pretty easy to set up and use, but it stalls half the time. I generally prefer to watch movies WITHOUT it locking up every 5-10 minutes. I'm definitely looking for a new DVD player. I don't recommend the P241 to anyone."
1,"Avoid, avoid, avoid...","I actually have an earlier model Samsung DVD player, and it, along with other Samsung models at the time, had a horrible skipping problem on many DVDs. Samsung's support was almost non-existant -- I found out there was a firmware upgrade for the player, but not through their website (where I couldn't find any help whatsoever), but through a friend with the same problem. HOWEVER, the firmware upgrade did not resolve the problem, and the last I heard, there was a class action suit filed here in Pennsylvania (which I received an invitiation to be a part of, but could not participate in, I think because I no longer had the receipt). Considering their lackluster customer support, I would advise anyone against buying any DVD player from this company. Players are much cheaper nowadays anyway, and you can get an excellent Sony or Toshiba for a modest price."
1,Horrible Product!,"I bought this unit, took it home, connected it and started to play a rented version of Master and Commander and the screen kept going blue on me! At first I thought it was the disc so I returned the disc to where I rented it and got another. Same problem! Then I tried another disc that I KNOW is good and it came up fine! I'm not sure what the problem is since it only seems to mess up with rented DVDs but still, I would expect a little better quality even though it was only $60. I'll be returning the unit tomorrow."
5,Beauty the Invisible Embrace CDs,"John O'Donohue's beautiful voice brings alive the poetry of his words to open, soften, delight, inspire listeners to a deeper sence of the Mystery, God which is all around us expressed in everyday life through the infinate sources of Beauty. His book is equally wonderful, hearing his Irish voice is like adding music."
5,A significant book for our times....,"Now more then ever, humanity is being called to embrace Beauty.John O'Donohue's book is a portico into the gloriousNOW, where all Beauty is and has always been. I love this book,it is beautifully written, transformative, and practical.Let's turn off the computer, facebook, twitter, phones andtake a collective breath, and begin to enter into the marvelous."
1,not worth the time or price!,I spent 2 hours trying to get a sense of premise from this book and was sadly disappointed. After hearing an interview with the author I expected to to read something on par with Anthony De Mello's thoughtful books but the substance never arrived. The author is clearly thoughtful and perhaps mystical but in this book the scattered thoughts are never united. Perhaps the book can serve as Koan. This recommendation from NPR was one of the rare disappointments from that resource.
4,Santa's Revenge,"I read this book in about a week, I think. It was really good, but not as action packed as F. Paul Wilson's new book, By the Sword. I loved the bit about Santa's revenge. I look forward to reading more from this author."
3,Super Reader,"A doctor is very disturbed when her father passes away, and she has to deal with his estate, including real estate. She wants nothing to do with, and gets rid of it. She has a key, but to what? Things seem to be getting weird and supernatural.She ends up turning for help to a brusque Repairman Jack who gives her no promises, and they delve deeper into something odd, and sinister."
5,TERRIFIC!!!!!,"LEGACIES is another in an impressive series of Repairman Jack novels, this is an interesting series dealing with the ""OTHERNESS"" which is not for the fainthearted. Back after a long hiatus repairman jack does not dissapoint, his bloody brand of justice never loses a beat."
2,"Tomb was entertaining, this one's not","I read this book a month ago - and I cannot remember if I finished it or not. I enjoyed THE TOMB, but here Wilson tries too much to make another Burke (see Vachss) out of Jack and fails. After reading Legacies, I cancelled all my other orders for Wilson's books. Maybe I'll give him another try (still got Implant - unread) later this year, but I doubt it. Not for people that want to read something with substance during the few free hours of their lifes."
3,Good Thriller,"I saw this book and saw it was a sequel so decided to buy The Tomb to start the series out from the beginning (which you don't need to do).I was disappointed that the supernatural element wasn't in this book -- I think when you start the series off with a supernature theme to it, the expectation is that it might remain there. However, this book stands on it's own even still.I was also disappointed that the relationship between Jack and Gia wasn't explored as in the first book -- Jack is more of the ""fix it"" man in this book against nasty characters of the Arab world.The book is good -- not just as good as the first one. I think the author spent too much time away from the characters and this book didn't come off as intimate with the characters as the first.I plan to read the reveiws of the 3rd and see if it's more like the first and if so, will continue on in the series."
3,Good - but I hoped for better,A real page turner but I dont think that it was up to Repairman Jack's standards. Too many stale cliches and a storyline that steps on its own toes.
3,Not a totally complete guide,"This is a nice pocket-size book, with clear maps. However, it is not totally complete because although individual maps are given of Japan's main TRTA/Eidan and Toei subway lines, no maps at all are included of the JR lines.As anyone who has ever rode the Tokyo subway knows, the JR lines are an intrinsic part the system, esp. the green Yamanote line that makes a continuous loop around all hubs of central Tokyo. The maps that are included show where the JR subway stations are, but not where the JR routes go. How this can be left out of a book that would be otherwise complete is beyond me."
3,You can do better,"`Although the information in this book is useful as far as it goes, I didn't buy it, based on the example page showing Toromon Station. Instead, I bought Kodansha's Tokyo City Atlas: A Bilingual Guide. It has the same maps, showing exits, plus:1) It shows a much larger surrounding area served by the station, usually including neighboring/alternate stations, putting it in a more useful geographic context.2) It's in color which makes it much easier to read.3) VERY important: it shows all the`` banchi (block) numbers, which most maps are lacking, and without which it's almost impossible to find an address in Tokyo`"
4,"Looks super slick, but works just ok","I got this opener as a gift and I really love the way it looks. Its smooth, sleek and feels great in the hand. However, the gap in the middle means very little contact is made with the bottle cap. The first few times I used it, it slipped. With a little focus, and not too many bottles under the belt, it can work every time. But I am worried about scratching it with slipping, so i am hesitant to use it everyday, because I want it to be nice when guests come over. I give it 4 stars instead 3 because when people come over, this will be the opener I put out. It looks that good.On second thought, I also give it a 4 because it's made in Germany, and I don't drink German beer, so the bottle cap fit might just be a nationality thing."
2,Does not work well with domestic bottle caps,Works well with only German bottle caps (perhaps all Europe and UK sized caps too). With domestic bottles it must be placed carefully on cap and even then it may take two tries. Women may think it is too large for smaller hands. Ours was manufactured in China.Try the Rösle brand bottle opener. The Rösle is also made in China but a traditional German design that fits well in large and small hands and works flawlessly on all bottle caps.Rosle Bottle Opener
5,Beautiful and easy to use,"I bought this as a little surprise gift for my husband, and he loves it. The lines are so clean and modern and lovely, and the heft is really nice. Other reviewers had complained about it not being quite the right size to open American beer bottles, but we really haven't seen that problem at all -- it's worked fine to open several different varieties (from local microbrew to Bud) with ease. It also doesn't seem to be scratched up like other reviewers said -- we've been using ours plenty (and not just saving it for guests -- beautiful things should be ENJOYED!) and it still looks great. This is an awesome dude gift idea, IMO, or a host gift for a party given by people with clean, modern taste."
3,"it works, kinda","so i bought this item, kind of, for a convenience factor and also b/c i wanted more accurate readings. it works in that it will meter light as it should, but it does not fair so well in metering dark shadows. it just returns a code that states ""Unable to Expose"", well it flashes Eu back at me. i don't know if this is just a problem with mine, i haven't researched the issue on the web yet, but it still defeats the purpose of the adapter. so in that sense the item doesn't work.maybe i just need to mess with it more, but since getting the reading error i've pulled it of and gone back to regular reflective metering.if you have the money, just look into buying a spot meter that is specifically built for the job."
4,A civil war buff,"This book was a lot easier to read than McFeely's biography of Grant. It has a more even flow and tempo to it. Mr. Simpson shows that Grant was not the moron which post 1910 historians tend to portray him as. Mr. Simpson also does not goes into the syrupy viewpoint which 19th century historians tended to have of Grant. Grant was a man of few words, iron willed, and when he had to be, for better or worse, a decision maker. If you are looking for a book which introduces you to Grant and the historical context of the times in which he lived, this is a solid book."
4,Hurrah for the Union,"Pay no attention to the naysayers, this is a solid book. I'm holding back the last star because I want to see what the author does with his second volume (making sense of reconstruction is THE great challenge of American history). Fine job."
2,"Love Grant, but this bored me","I have long admired Grant and was hoping this would be a definitive examination of his life. I was disappointed. There was nothing new in the book and it didn't focus its energy on examining Grant's personality or relationships with signaificant others in his life.The sections on the civil war were good and the battles were described well. But I kept asking, ""Where is Grant?"" I never got a good sense of what he looked like, how he felt or how he ticked. This was a major stumbling block.The worst area was the author's excuse-making for Grant's drinking. He never simply said, ""Yes, he got drunk."" It was a long laundry list of excuses or casting doubts on many eyewitnesses. This got irritating.It was not an uplifting experience to enjoy the subject of US Grant and be completely bored by a book on his life."
1,Fawning book,"This book is just another fawning apology for an overrated general. It also contains some strange inaccuracies, such as the one on page 239: ""Before long there was bad news, Sherman sent word that in fact he had not taken Tunnel Hill - a deep ravine just north of that location, which had escaped Union observation [italics mine], served to give the Confederates an ideal defensive position."" In fact, as is obvious from available records, the entire Chattanooga area was completely mapped by Union topographers. The statement that the ravine served to give an ""ideal defensive position"" can only be the result of lack of careful reading about Cleburne's conduct of the defense and ignorance about the terrain in question. Cleburne in fact set up his defensive line at least 500 yards south of the ravine and near the top of a gentle slope almost at the far end of Tunnel Hill."
2,Wide of the mark,"I was disappointed by this first volume of Grant's life. The sections on the war were accurate, fair and well-written. But the concentration on the professional areas of Grant's life came at the expense of the private side. A previous reviewer said said this book concentrates on Grant's marriage and family relationships. I found almost none of that in this book.I hope that in volume two, the author puts his concentration on Grant first as a man of the nineteenth century and not as a cog in the wheel of the military or politics. Bruce Catton wrote about Grant in a well-rounded manner, this book is simply too dry for enjoyable reading."
3,"Solid and informative, but a bit dry.","I come to this book as someone not wholly uninformed on the subject, but far from expert. So I can't comment on the accuracy of the author's facts, other than to say that they certainly seemed plausible and well-researched, and in no way contradictory to what little I know of the subject. Assuming that his facts are accurate, this book is certainly worthwhile for the novice, even if the writing style, while far from impenetrable, is certainly not compelling or sparkling. I have no idea whether someone knowledgeable on the subject would find anything new or groundbreaking here.Keep in mind that this is not a one-volume full life bio; it only goes slightly past the end of the Civil War, leaving many important parts of Grant's life (his presidency, for instance) for the second volume. But for what it covers, it is informative and worth reading."
4,A MUST HAVE !! For all Civil War buffs!,"A Must Have for Grant-a-holics!!! Like Me. Since I have over 30 books on Lincoln, I thought I would do some reading about Gen. Grant. I now have over 10 books about this marvelous military genius. The title is appropriate, he went through a lot of bad stuff before rejoining the Union Army eventually leading to the surrender at Appomatox. Grant has become a hero too me. Check out FIND A GRAVE and you will see my tributes to him. I grew up in Nashville and I am a diehard scalawag. Thank God for Lincoln, GRANT, Sherman et.all. Great read a must have for any ""Grant fan"" like me!!! My name is Marilyn not the one above."
2,A Waste of Time,"This is not a terrible book, but it is a highly irrelevant one. Simpson has nothing new or interesting to say about his subject--he merely recycles material found in earlier, more interesting Grant books, such as the works of Lloyd Lewis, Bruce Catton, and Horace Porter, and his writing style is strangely tedious, as if he occasionally lost interest in what he himself was writing. Simpson sometimes actually manages to make Grant's life look dull--something I had thought was a near-impossibility. Perhaps Simpson's next volume will be more original and involving, but I'm not holding my breath."
1,Little new here,"The text appears to be highly derivative of the works which preceded it and the author provides little that is new beyond a spectacularly one-sided view of General Ulysses S. Grant.All Grant's errors are minimized or omitted completely from the story. Praise of the general, sometimes merited sometimes not, goes on and on. Some evenhandedness, please."
4,Lots of fun.,I tried to talk my son out of spending his birthday money on this toy but he HAD to have it. I tried on convice him it was made of cheap plastic and would be broken within a day. Well I was wrong and he reminds me I was wrong everytime he plays with it(Daily). This toy is a hit and I like that it has a volume control. I got my finger stuck in the skull trying to remove an ovesized car that got stuck. It didn't hurt because all the pieces are blunt and the kids have never gotten thier finger pinched. The noises it makes did scare my 2 year old at first but now he also loves this toy and helping his big brother play.
4,FUN PLAYSET KIDS WILL LOVE,"I love the way Matchbox is designing more products with young kids in mind. These neat little themed playsets are meant to be played with rather than stored away by collector's only. Not that I have anything against collecting. But I still like it when toy makers keep kids in mind as well as collectors. Matchbox has been doing that with these great playsets. I first got the Haunted House one for my sone and now this Pirates Buried Treasure playset.Kids will love the spooky atmosphere with chilling sounds and lights as the cars pass through the skull island trees and lagoon. Great even for your little imaginext figures even. And for Collectors, I personally think these make wonderfull frightful dioramas for display. The sets are all well built, and work very well and are durable. Comes with a pirate SUV and playmat. Well made toy and very fun for kids."
4,Great Value & Lots of Fun,"I bought this for my 4yr for his b-day, and he loves it. Unlike the Hot Wheel's toys, it is all put together, and easy to use. You can play with it more than once, without it falling apart!!!"
4,Bought for 4 year old...,"My son loves this toy. He has not ""trapped"" his finger in the skull like I have read in other reviews. I can see how it could happen though. It only has two removable parts, so less to lose. He can put the pieces together himself and uses the playmat even more than the toy itself. We have a lot of these car playsets and this one is one of the best."
5,Non-stop Fun!,"I bought this for my son for Christmas after he saw it advertised in a magazine. He has been playing with it almost non-stop since then. It is loud and somewhat intricate but easily masterable by small kids. It also connects with other Matchbox sets and comes with a mat for layout. Based on my boy's interest and use so far, this rates 5 out of 5."
4,Satisfied with a bargain,"I was able to pick this item up at a local store for $10 and have to say at that price point it was a great deal. The car wash is very interactive with many station to go though. Up the elevator, through the working bubble blower and conveyor belt, down to the spinning bowl wash, and then to the fan. Great fun!!!"
1,not worth it,"does not give off enough spark, to small to fit in your hand, don't even bother try'n it in cold weather.... i use the light my fire and cotten balls with vaseline as the last resort, gives off good spark and no problen getting a fire go'n with natural material"
3,Small and Compact,"I haven't had an opportunity to test this out yet, but it does generate a good amount of sparks so I imagine it should be good for other types of ""tinder"" as well.The small package makes this kit convenient to carry and the orange color makes it easy to find quickly."
5,brilliant little item,"People, read the directions. There are directional arrows on the handle that show you the correct direction to turn the wheel. When you do that, you won't hurt your thumb and you will get tons of big hot sparks that will spark a fire right up. The tinder quiks work great. Don't ding the product because you can't read directions. Sheesh."
4,almost great,"Having been fan of Verne's AWA I have to say the first dvd is really very good,and a true must for any wrestling fan.I wasn't as bothered by what was on the dvd's as much as what wasn't. Huge talk about the Road Warriors and the Freebirds and yet no matches to be found. What gives??? The match with Curt Hennig and Nick Bockwinkle is by far the best on the dvd.The Midnight Rockers cage match againest Playboy Bddy Rose and Doug Sommers is a close 2nd. We really could have used a 3rd disc.The AWA was around for over 30yrs and this is it!!! I have read bad things about Verne Gagne,but is there any sucessful owner/promoter that hasn't taken knocks over things real or imagined? I did like this overall because of the history of the sport.That seems to be missing now and is totally been molopolized as it was back in the 30's and 40's. The interview segments with Bockwinkle were great.The ones with Jim Ross(WWE toady) not so much.WWE Presents: The Spectacular Legacy of the AWA"
4,Old school Wresting Stories,This bring some old stories about a lost wrestling company that die too early -- Many stars now aday grew up watching or taking part in this company over the years
3,Not that good...,WWE has managed to release another dud. The DVD is boring especially in the beginning but towards the end it finally picks up. The footage could have been a little longer and more informative. And more matches could have been added. It seems as though the WWE only wants to focus on the former AWA stars that went onto WWE and no one else. The box art should have been a warning. So once again the WWE tells a one sided story...
4,Great Dvd,"The documentary is great, but the wrestling matches were cut short and not great. I don't know AWA matches well, but there should have been better matches included."
4,A spectacular legacy indeed....,"As with all dvd releases highlighting the various wrestling federations of the past,yes it must suck to have their history told from the WWE's point of few,but hats off to the WWE for allowing the fans of today to enjoy some of the history & legacy the wrestling business has to offer.I really enjoyed this offering,and truthfully wished it could have been longer & that much more in depth."
3,Solving Differential Equations: Nonstiff Problem,"I bought this book just because I have been using MATLAB's ODE function to simulate my physiological models. The MATLAB mannual recommend it. Although I found its content very useful for me, it is too much mathematics. Maybe it is the best book for mathematics major, but not for a non-mathematics major. As a Engineering major, I even find it difficult to read sometimes. I've got the book about two years, but have not finished to read it yet."
4,Nicely woven story,I enjoyed reading the historical and cultural nuances within this book. There were certain passages that made me feel as if I was there with the characters.Navigating Life's Roadways: Stories of Insight from My Odyssey and Inspiration for Your Journey
1,Lousy,"I was forced to read this book for a class, and maybe if I had picked it up with the romantic notion I would learn something, I would have been slightly less disappointed.The goal of our reading this book was to break down sterotypes. In breaking the stereotype of East Africa as an undeveloped region, it creates an array of images of a savage rape filled culture.As far as the reviews: Africa does not have a soul nor does any inanimate object. It does not, I am afraid inject, density into history, I would argue the latter.If you are a dreamer and enjoy histrical FICTION read this book you might enjoy it."
3,Kinda Eh...,The movie was sort of boring in places and overbearing with the sorority girl image at times. I am in a sorority and it is absolutely NOTHING like this movie. And the fact that someone dies right in the beginning because she doesn't look like a model is really messed up.
1,Sorority girls murder mystery,"This movie at times seemed like part-sorority house porno, part-murder mystery. It gets pretty stupid and juvenile. It's pretty pathetic what passes for entertainment today. There's really no need to make the sex scenes so explicit and make these girls such bad role models. I worry about all the young girls who watch this movie."
1,Waste of Time,"Stupid, sick movie with no point to it. What a shame that this is the kind of entertainment that is presented these days. Where are the classy, elegant, meaningful movies that used to be. A shame."
1,pure garbage,"This movie is problably one of the worst I've ever had to sit through. Nothing about this movie is funny, it is full of vulgarities and unlikeable characters. It was painful to sit through. I'm just stunned how bad this was. I was hoping that a masked killer would show up and start disposing of the useless teenage brats like in Halloween or Friday the 13th, then maybe there would have been something to laugh at, in this dreadful waste of a movie. You would have to be brain dead to find this movie remotely good. I bought this dvd as a gift, based on the positive reviews on here. Ooops!"
3,Left behind... worship??,"What's with the title? The music itself is solid enough to stand on its own, so the packaging simply smacks of a crass marketing ploy to tie in the Left Behind series (to which the music really is unrelated). Being left behind and missing the rapture should be considered a disaster, not a starting point to sell records.The same songs can be found on other compilations; I would recommend going to those."
5,The Best CD of the year,"This Cd is one of the best. I really enjoyed all 11 songs, and personally think its a great buy. If you have enjoyed the Left Behind series, I'm sure you'll love this."

4,good 70's crime movie starring three legends,This movie has a good transfer quality and preserves the original widescreen aspect ratio. This was one of my childhood favorite movies and to this day I still like it. The presence of these three great actors should be reason enough for anyone else. The movie itself maybe gets a 3.5/5. The price was a bit high though.
4,I like this movie,"Not a 5 star movie, but I like it more than its reputation might suggest. Might be enjoyable for fans of the genre. James Mason and Michael Caine always make a movie interesting :-) Set in Paris and the south of France, another point in its favor :-) I looked it up just now hoping to find it was out on DVD but no luck. Some of these 1970s movies of the genre might be made into an interesting DVD collection :-)Edit: now available on DVD from Amazon (my copy just arrived :-)The (brief) appearance by Pierre Salinger in the poker game is almost worth the price of admission in itself (for those who are into that kind of thing :-)"
2,"Le Puff, Le Pant, It Iz Ze Deztructors","Pristine DVD transfer, but who cares? Terrific scenery and stellar cast wasted in a turgid script and TV-level production. The cartoonish sound effects are actually funny. No bonus disc features, no real reason for them. Marcel Buzzoti, one of the creepy villains from ""French Connection"" is tossed away, as is the beautiful Alexandra Stewart as Caine's love interest. Can't even remember this getting a mention in Caine's fabulous recent memoir, and you can understand why. 'Hope Quinn, Mason, Caine, et al enjoyed their French vacation on the producer's dime. Really makes you wonder what this film could've been with a decent script and director. Le Pew..."
3,Pretty Good Value,The price for this was not that bad. The only issue that the cables are very thin which makes the sound suffer a little. For the price I paid (.99) it was a great buy.
2,(Vol. 1) - Not What You May Think,"Much to my dismay, there was hardly any mention of miracles or prayer. Instead, the author focuses primarily on the realm of physics, with a rudimentary knowledge of the subject matter. It is very hard to tell where the author is going the entire time, jumping from one concept to another. I hope that the second volume does a better job at ""getting to the point."" If I had to speculate, this book is nothing but a rather large introductory message for volume 2, or at least I hope so. Don't waste you money on this one, you would be much better off buying an introductory book about relativity and quantim physics. You would learn more and be just as prepared to look at the mysteries of Kabbalah."
4,"Overall, this is a very informative book on the Husky breed.","This book is expertly written regarding the content the author chose to focus on. By that I mean the book does a great job in covering the history of the Siberian Breed as well as the prominent Husky breeders. As an owner of Huskies who is just getting to begin the breeding process, I was looking for an informative book for the do's and don'ts, how to know for sure when your bitch is is season, the average number of puppies in a litter, etc. In short, a book on practical matters. This book devotes a very small portion of its 500+ pages to things of that nature. I must say though, I have not found a Husky book that covers that focuses on this subject. The author does a thorough job of what she does cover, and does it in a way that makes me feel proud to be a Husky owner."
5,Great book!,I bought this book for my church's sunday school. But my daughter loves it so much! I have to order another one for her. The only problem is I could not stop her from the story. She kept ask me to read another one. They story is really good for kids. It is simple and short.And the coloring page is good too. I bought several different kinds bible story books for my daugher. But she loves this one best!!
5,A great SS tool,"I enjoyed this book. I already had Book 2. Both are very helpful working with children as they not only have the story, but a coloring page, too."
1,Bible Story Color Pages,Great book but there are about 15 pages missing right at the beginning. Very disappointing.
2,Not Horribly Good,"Some of Carson's earlier work is just great ('Shelter', 'Where It Goes'). Even the recordings that are spotty ('Stars' & 'Everything I Touch Runs Wild') have some stellar moments. 'Finest Thing' does not favorably compare to the iffy disks, let alone to her first two. This is not even as good as the bogged down 'House in the Weeds'.Some of the songs here are way too ethereal or just down right new-agey (mostly instrumentals ""Long Walk"", ""She Can't Dance"" ""Grey World & 'Glimmer'). Too Julee Cruise/Twin Peaks-ish, but w/out the cool vocals.When Carson does use her vocals they are still interesting, but too few and far between on this disk. I still love when she harmonizes w/herself.I applaud the fact she writes, plays and produces just about everything she does. However, I think she benefited from Anton Fier's production on earlier works (and w/the Golden Palominos)."
1,bleak to say the least,"Listening to her now makes you think that any sort of maturity in her music stalled with ""Shelter"". This album, apparently representing deep meditations can be simply compared to the pretentiousness that is ridiculed in past SNL's ""deep thoughts by jack handey""Perhaps she would do well to collaborate with some evolved musician who can distance the music a bit from their deep thoughts or painful self-reflections. Snore........!I would say this album is typically the self-indulgent, self-referential style that that seems to be part of her recent artistic make-up.There is little to nothing to take away from her music, nor anything that enhancies your experience of music. It non-inclusive, and hence leaves you feeling a bit desserted and cheated at the end."
5,Camerabag light,"It's big enought for a large DSLR with a medium zoom and an extra lens. Easy to carry, with shoulderstraps so you can fasten it to your chest for easy axess when you've got an rucksack on your back. Pockets in the lock and in the front with good zippers. It weights almost nothing and the price is nice. I've not tested it in rain."
1,Does not fit 2002 camry LE,"This product does not fit the 2002 Camry LE edition correctly. The front doors worked without any issues but the rear doors did not work as desired. Once the visors were put in place the windows could no longer be rolled up, it hit the visor thereby leaving a gap as wide as the palm of the hand. This product comes NOT recommended for 2002 Camry LE model cars. The product is robust and looks good, however since it does not fit the car, the product quality becomes immaterial."
2,Below what I expected..,"It didin't fit right. My rear window always got stuck with the deflector when closing. The deflectors are really bulky and because of that, they block a lot of incoming breeze well. I had to return.. I will spend more money and get Weathertech - I own this brand on my Honda Pilot and they fit well, very nice looking.."
5,Lots of ideas,A good book with lots of ideas for building a screened-in space. Better than most books on the subject.
2,Not useful if you actually want to screen in a porch,"I would like to screen in an existing porch and I found very little useful information in this book. If you want pictures of screened porches or very general information then this book would be ok. If you actually want to screen in a porch yourself, keep looking, this book will not help."
2,Cheap Made & Horrible Fit,I typically wear a large in T-shirts but the large in this one is WAY to big for me. The sleeve openings are big enough to wear around my legs. I returned it for a medium and the medium is too small but the sleeves are still huge. It just looks weird and doesn't feel soft and breathable like the 50/50 shirts I'm used to wearing.
4,Snug for the size but did not draw up too much.,"For an X-Large, this was snug. That's actually perfect for a Marine's shirt because baggy might look frumpy or sloppy, right? We can't have that. I bought several Marine shirts from this site and we love them all. They've been through several washes and still look great and fit well. Not super thick and not thin at all. Just right."
4,Pretty Good for an 81 year-old fiddler,"Here's Ruggiero Ricci at 81, playing Kreisler. He does very well in the quick pieces, but as expected, falters intonationally in the more lyrical fare like Liebesleid, Liebesfreud and The Old Refrain. The other works are done exceptionally well. I bought it for Violin History's sake, and I must tell you that I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of his playing in the upbeat selections. Most fiddlers were finished at age 70 and under, and here he is, with his customary fearless dash. Probably the best over 70 violinist I've ever heard was Francescatti; his hearing and technique seemed undiminished at 73. Ricci's got to be the best over 80 violinist, ever."
3,plenty of corn in this oater,Saw this listed and then looked up the film in the good the bad and the voilent(a must have for spaghetti western fans)and it sounded intresting. Corny it is but well filmed and the action is plentyfull you will laugh at the hereo's name you will gasp at the corny lines but all in all as these films go better than average a very clear print and overpriced to hell.I enjoyed this rare oater and you would be hard to please if you arn't Al Watts Radio presenter Australia
3,Keep it together,"I love this megaphone's power, but the construction is poor. I am on my third one. They sent a replacement for the first one, because the handle came loose. Then the handle came loose on the second one. I traded that one directly to the manufacture (who was local) and then I put MONSTOR glue on the screws in the handle before it had a chance to come loose. Now, my new glued bullhorn is awesome!Call me crazy, but I loved the ""Black color and wanted the powerful sound this unit delivers so I kept trying. So far after 2 months the handle has not loosened."
4,fun!,"Very good volume, like the siren. Use it on occasion when the kids are making so much noise that they do not hear me call them downstairs. I have also used it to holler for the kids to come in the house when it is time for dinner. I use it to joke around sometimes. Just don't ever use it in someone's ear!"
3,incorrect picture,"The Felco #12 is a smaller version of the Felco #7. (Check out the #7 for a more accurate image of the #12.Felco F-7 Gardening Hand Pruner With Rotating Handle #F-7) One handle arm is thicker to accommodate the ""swivel action"" of the rotating handle."
2,Technical information,"(Labeled as 110 labels, etc.) I was intrigued by price but could not find specifically what it contained.Here is what I received. 11 sheets. Each contained 2 DVD labels (22 total) with large center hole. Sheet also contained 2 side case labels (4 inch by 1/4 inch approx.) and 6 labels (1.9 inch by 1.4 inch) (2+2+6)*11 = 110. It also contained 5 jewel case inserts and 6 song booklets. It contained a custom tool for placing label on the DVD. DVD labels are offset but different from the Memorex layout. Package also contained software for printing labels."
1,this,this book prides itself on a definition of what is atheism. but the only defines atheism by what it is not. in my experience debating with believers of god and religion that way of debating only leaves the theist in a stronger position than before. this book merely reinforces that belief and does nothing to introduce anyone to atheism. the book seems to be about debating the lack of strength and contradictions in religion than it is about the atheistic world view. this book tries to define what atheism in the terms of a religion which it is not. atheists agree on one thing and one thing only and that is that there is not god. the writer obviously forgot that and decided to write a diatribe directed against people of religion which most atheists are apt to do even though they are the first ones to decry attempts by other religions to write diatribes against them.
1,Begs the question!,"For instance, he did not justify his moral views at all. All he did was assume it. Furthermore, he is quite unscholarly. In his debate with Michael Butler he only knew of the Trinity of God by hearing it in normal conversation with Christians WITHOUT reading up on it at all!"
4,"Short, informative, and fun to read!","This is an excellent introduction to atheism. If you're a theist, and have been reading the atheism newsgroups on the net, you may be overwhelmed by the volume of traffic and, unfortunately, a fair amount of hostility. This book presents a clear and non-hostile introduction to the topic of atheism. It may likely cause you to question you belief system. At the very least, it is a worthwhile addition to the bookshelf of anyone on either side of the great theism vs. atheism debate."
4,A keeper!,"This was at times a thriller and at times a heart breaker. I have read some of Ms. Cresswell's previous books and while they were OK I wasn't overly jazzed about them, but this one was definitely different!"
3,Average at best,"I really debated between 2 and 3 stars, but decided to be generous. Because I love books by James Patterson, a friend of mine loaned this book to me. I am very glad I did not actually pay money for it! It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't good either. The main plot was all right, but the book could have used some very serious editing; it just went on and on and on. I decided to give this 3 stars because of the basic story and the intrigue was there, but if the book would have been about 150 pages shorter, it would have been much better.While reading, I often looked to see how many pages I had yet to go (never a good sign) and often found myself putting the book down to clean out the dishwasher and do laundry (again, never a good sign). With Patterson, I want to read until finished. This one I debated long and hard about even continuing."
3,1/2 Stars,"This book had more romance than the past couple of JC's that I have read. It was fairly predictable, and I found myself skimming quite a few sections.Charlotte is left on X-mas eve by her husband. Turns out he was a terrorist, (according to the FBI). She is devastated, moves to a warm climate and alienates herself from life. She is trying to get over all the memories.FBI starts questioning her again, she gets kidnapped, (yes by her ex) Falls in love all over again. Very predictable.I would read this, only if I did not have something else I was interested in at the time. It was good, but not great!!!"
3,A Dull Ringer,Don't get me wrong.I'm a big Jasmine Cresswell fan. Most of her books are excellent. But Dead Ringer is left wanting. Most of the story is predictable and there's really no real surprises. Towards the end is really good. So that reason I'm giving it three stars. But if you want an exciting Cresswell books to read Veils of Deceit.
3,Two and a half stars: Predictable!,This is my first book from Ms. Cresswell. Due to great reviews I expected something original and interesting. This is actually a government suspense. Nevertheless I found it totally predictable and very slow moving.
2,"Big book, small pictures","Poor quality and small pictures on good glossy paper, not for a painter. There is no usefull picture about Ophelia(first picture is very small second one is just a detail)."
5,String Quartets / Webern,String Quartets / Webern is a 1992 Nippon Columbia recording starring the Carmina Quartet. Here we get to hear two composers. First we get to hear Karol Szymanowski and then Anton Webern. Michael Struck-Schloen has written the music notes. A very fine performance by the Carmina Quartet and one that I very much enjoyed listening to. Highly recommended. 5/5.
2,"After 13 months, adhesive came off. Don't jeopardize your fragile items with these!","For my application, I used these strips to hold up a 2x4 7lb dry erase board on a eggshell finished wall. Every single strip in the packet was used at 6 inch intervals around the border of the frame. I would've hoped this would've held up a lot longer with the adhesive used, but I also remember initially having to press extremely hard on each pressure point for the board to stick to the wall. While I love 3m products for their innovation & normal best in class performance, I can't recommend this product especially when there are products better suited for something that weighs more than a cardboard box, like their 3m picture hanging strips (which I have had excellent success with under the same application, ironically).3M Command 17206 White Picture-Hanging Strips, Large"
4,One little problem...,"The whole Command system is wonderful, but I have a really hard time getting the hook on ""straight,"" so I go through a lot of replacement strips trying to get it just right."
5,Perfect For Hanging Many Different Things,"These Command strips live up to their name and I have used this brand of mounting strips for years and am never disappointed by them. They hold extremely well, yet are easy to remove and do not leave a residue or sticky film behind. 3M really outdid themselves when inventing this type of adhesive. I would recommend them to anyone."
4,3M is always very strong,it just worked fine in my bathroom to hang some stuff without making a hole in the wall
3,Challenging for a 7 year old,"This game is being used by my daughter who is 7. She is having a bit of a hard time getting past the first level. It is not really clear at first how to play. I must admit that as a 40 year old, it took me a while to get it, but I am not a gamer. I'm sure an older child might like it although it is somewhat slow moving (the penguins march slowly)."
3,New game,"This book takes the world of vampires, warewolves, and other things that go bump in the night into the world of RPGs and makes it compatible with numerous game systems. I have used Nightbane characters in games such as Palladium Fantasy, Rifts, Vampire the Masqurade, and even a version of tabletop Star Wars RPG."
3,A unrealistic storyline; Lim can do better,"This story takes place against the backdrop of Singapore in the 1950s. However, as a Singaporean, I find the work misleading in some areas. It does not really and truly reflect a real Singapore. It is predictable and kind of soapy, a storyline which I am not a great fan of. But it is worth a read in a leisurely afternoon, just do not take the content seriously. Mrs. Lim is afterall a really great storyteller."
5,"Wonderful, moving, rich.................",This book is oh so wonderful. I lost one copy and had to have a replacement. A real winner don't pass it up.
2,Yawn.....,"This book is very average, it seems to have appealed to alot of people which surprises me. I for one found it to be a crashing bore."
4,Its the most exciting book I ever read!!,"I like this book cause it tells about the pain & love of a clever bondmaid in Southeast Asia.Its funny, disgusting, painful & romantic all in one.I cried at the ending cause its so movingly described.Most of all,this is one book u must not miss to read."
2,Pearl Buck did it better!,"Nothing new and certainly not exceptional about this story. If you want a good read about old China stick with The Good Earth, Pavilion of Women, or Imperial Woman. Ms. Lim's characters are flat and there's nothing about them that still makes you want to read on to the predictable ending."
2,Yawn!,"A little ""Secret Garden""; a little ""Tess"" and a whole lot of the same-old-same-old romance novel. If you want a good book about Eastern Culture and Women read ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" instead. If you just want something for mindless escape, then this is an ok way to send an evening."
3,Great storyline.,"Beginning of story is well-paced, exploring the interesting characters. But some issues were not adequately addressed like how Young master Wu felt towards his wife Li-Li since young til before and after their marriage, prior to her pregnancy. And his falling in love with Han happened so quickly and mysteriously, it almost seemed like the author was trying to avoid writing too much about it. The part about the sky-god raping the goddess was totally baffling. Still, the other parts of the story were captivating enough especially towards the end when Han suffered. The surprisingly tragical ending sorta made up for the earlier confusing parts.Recommended to those interested in the traditional chinese culture."
1,Save your #,"Wow, save your $. The lies and arrogance are nauseating. Nothing like catching a 100lb fish and calling it 300. Trev is so far removed from the man his father was. In this case, the apple fell far from the tree, rolled down a long hill and into the sewer. There are so many other quality fishing shows out there. Don't waste your money on this one."
5,The hidden dangers in the rainbow.,"I'm still in the process of reading this book. So far, I would highly recommend this book to others- a good expose of a shadowy subject! Too many people get caught up in movements without much critical thought, only to be used, hurt or deluded. There are many critics out there of the ""lunatic fringe"" as some would describe this topic, but this book appears to examine this one from many angles. This book should be a good addition to your library and should be read by everyone interested in this subject!"
2,I agree - it is the work of a sick mind.,Contance Cumby really tapped into the paranoid conspiracy theorist type witch hunt mentality of some evangelicals with this group. She started a feeding frenzy which spread to the likes of Dave Hunt and Tex Marrs. This is filled with deceptive information and half truths.
2,Interesting Anti-New Age Opinion WithTwisted Logic,"I love to learn about opposing sides of different issues. Since I'd read 'new-age' conspiracy books, I thought it would be interesting to get an opinion from the opposite end of the spectrum. I did not find this book to have a balanced viewpoint. The author lumps all religious traditions that are not fundamentalist Christian, Jewish, or Moslem as evil. I was also unsure of her definition of what individuals, organizations and belief systems qualify as the dreaded 'New Age. However, I thought her comparison of Nazism and the New Age movement intersting though twisted. Also, she does share an interesting perspectives on some characters in her 'new age' movement; Creme, Alice Bailey, Maitreya, David Spangler, Jim Jones. Buy it used."
2,Connecting Lord Buddha with Lucifer! Why! How!!!!!!!!,"I read this book cover to cover and I can never understand why the author, deliberately connected Lord Buddha with Lucifer. On page 136, the author wrote, ""..The name of Buddha itself means ""Lightbearer""- the same meaning as the name Lucifer.."" How can anyone connect the most compassionate Buddha, who did not even recoganize Hindu scriptures, and who asked his devotees to keep away from Hindus be connected with Lucifer?? In India, Buddha is respected, even though he kept away from Hinduism!!"
5,Good deal with free shipping,"You might be able to find a better deal at Walmart, but in my case I needed something shipped to me and this was a good deal with free shipping. It comes shipped in a compact box and setup was easy. It is a solid construction and would be good for a small set of free weights."
1,Most horrible piece if junk,"The stand comes pre-scratched so you will not feel sorry if you add to this. The design is poor and seems designed by a baboon with just one goal in his mind: cheap and dirty. The screws use to tighten the bars will make the square bar bulge if tighten properly (sign of poor design and too thin metal foil - this might have worked for the Olympic set since the diameter of the bar is bigger so it can be crushed but NOT for this one). One of the holes came with the thread almost eroded so it was NO WAY it ca secure the bar (would jump the threads even when hand tighten (makes me laugh their statement ""Good quality made in china"") so I had to drill a hole through the bar and the other side of the square profile to make it functional. Finally, the clips that should secure the weights are NOT provided, which makes this contraption hazardous.Conclusion: poor design in US of A and lousy manufacturing in (where else?) China."
3,not as well put together as the 3rd edition,"The 3rd edition of this book saved my life more times then I can count. This version constantly refers you to the cd with arcane directions (what is cd-143?) and leaves you hanging. Good info, but bloody hard to find it."
5,Good for those that know a little scripting.,"This is not the manual to learn how to program in javascript. This is a great refrence for those that understand the use of scripts and know html. The way it is indexed accoding to different things you can use it for is great. If want to solve a problem, you can look in the index for it, and look up the page, and it will have a careful rundown of all the information you need to know. It then gives examples that are pretty helpful for practical applications."
4,I am enjoying this book,"After reading predominantly negative reviews of the book, I wasn't too sure about my purchase. However, as I started to read, I was more and more impressed with the clarity and orderly organization of the 'bible' that seems to cover a huge range of topics. So far I've finished the first 15 chapters, and find it very informative. Although I've programmed in Javascript on and off previously, this book helped to set the concepts straight, and cleared my mind, and improved my confidence in future javascripting. It might be a little too much for a complete beginner, but if you follow the chapters, I believe you'll benefit from the authur's vast knowledge.In 3 words: it's a keeper."
3,confused organization,I would give this book a five star rating for its content if it were easier to locate what I want. Particularly vexing is that the author has placed some of the content only on the CD with listings page such as 'CD-281.' After months of looking I can not find the files designated as 'CD' on the CD.
1,A Waste of My Money. Boo! Hiss!,"I bought this book expecting a little code and not a lot of code fragments with virtually no meaning to me. I find this book to be almost useless without the CD because most of the code is on the CD, which I did not receive. I have considerable experience in both programming languages and scripting, especially Java, PHP and MySQL.Worse yet I tried to locate the publisher and got a dead end search. The only plus side is that I bought the book for only $4. However, I feel like I wasted 4 dollars on it, so I decided to cut my losses and pitched it into file 13."
3,Buena utilidad para en embale de IE y netscape,"lo bueno es el comparativ de que funciona en que versión de cada producto, muy util para resolver chicharrones cuando se necesitaban certificar aplicaciones (funcionalidades)bajo varios navegadores"
3,JavaScript Bible,"A nice book - IF - you remember that it is a reference book, NOT a tutorial. Big difference there.To be fair, Goodman does explain in quite some detail about how browsers work, and what happens when a web page loads. Beyond that, if you are looking to learn JavaScript, I don't think this is the book to do it, monumental as it is to the task of being a ""bible"" on the subject.Get another real tutorial first, and then come back and learn the ""innards"" of JavaScripting. Goodman definitely knows his stuff, but a tutorial this is not. It is, simply put, a ""bible."""
4,good,"This book is great,coves probably everything there is to cover in javascript but...........if you have never doen anything like this before you should start out with something more siple first,although the book claims new people to web programming, the new people will have a hard time with it."
2,too much is not always not enough,I read this book but it seems still to be a beginners book. Lots of material is of no use. This book is not for the working programmers and still I have search for advanced javascripts here and there. sultan zahir khan(...)
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!,"I bought this book because I wanted a JavaScript reference that was current. Before that I was using the JavaScript reference section in ""Dynamic HTML - The Definitive Guide"" also by Goodman. That book served as an excellent reference. ""JavaScript Bible"" however is horrible. Many topics aren't covered in the book. The index refers you to the CD and then the topics cannot be found on the CD. This is extremely frustrating.I just looked up NN4 Events and was directed to CD-226 (I can't believe this topic wouldn't warrant its own page in the book). Then I discovered CD-226 doesn't exist on the CD. This seems to be the case whenever I try to reference something in ""JavaScript Bible"". Wading through the pdf version of the book on CD is extremely time consuming and often the pages don't exist.I still use my 1998 copy of ""Dynamic HTML"" as my JavaScript reference and use ""JavaScript Bible"" as a door stop. I want my money back."
3,"Good Reference, Confusing Structure","I bought this thinking it was the ultimate Javascript reference. What keeps it from being as thorough as it could be is the awful structure. A large part of the book isn't even in the book; it's on the CD-ROM. So, part of the book correlates to what's on the CD, but a VERY large part does not. Another thing about that that ... is that much of that large part is comprised of advanced Javascript.So, it's great to have a syntax reference, but it's not even very thorough about that.I'm a bit disappointed."
1,Personal Opinion,"I have to say I detest this book ! I'm sure if you're an experienced programmer it's ideal but for the rest of us it's next to useless ! Half the book's taken up with definitions and properties but no examples. I'm still looking for a good JavaScript book and this unfortunately does not qualify, I like a lot of the Bible' books but this does not live up to the standard set by the rest of the series.I suspect the editor was holiday when this was published."
4,LLC Book review,Very useful book for those who know little about the topic. Breaks down information well and will get you up to speed prior to consulting someone with legal expertise (I recommend).
4,The Wonderful Minature World of Verlinden,"Francois Verlinden started his model making business in Belguim in the early 80's. He recognised the insatiable demand for perfection bt serious modellers that the mass producers of plastic model kits was not fulfilling.As a result his business has grown to an international scale and is now based in O'Fallon MO USA.This is the 16th Catalogue covering some 1400 products from 120mm figurines made from resin covering such diverse historical eras as Ancient Rome thru WW2 German Soldiers and the Gulf War.Not to be left out their are pages of detailing and conversion kits for military vehicles and aircraft.This book is a real treasure chest of 'gob smacking', 'mouth watering' modelling projects which will tempt many readers to rush for their cheque books and credit cards to own models which will give hours of pleasure to build and can then be displayed to the amazement of their friends and relations."
3,Very Basic Meter,"This meter is very basic, simple and has no frills. I think sub-$100 would be a better price point for it. Use it as a second opinion to whatever you are getting from a camera's built-in meter, it isn't really sophisticated enough for much more. The instruction manual is lacking (at least in English). The method of displaying exposure settings between whole stops is kind of weird and the manual does not explain it well."
3,HOT MOVIE even with all the fake dix.,"No intercourse just some oral to the only guy brave enough to show his member, and if I had one his size I'd show it too. Good movie. Love the segment with the two thick women. The guest and the maid. Holy Christ Im still cleaning up my floor.Oops."
3,nothing special,"I buy everything by Tinto Brass but his imagination decline considerably lately and he is stuck in mainstream softcore porno lately.There are two versions of his Private-Italian and with English and both are same. I recommend Key, Paprica and Love and Passion as more representative of his style. He cannot find the balance between his imagination and reality and what his art should be about.Between Italian masters I see a lot of noise about Pasolini but noise represent noise not art and it much easier to talk about things we dont understand but I should say Tinto Brass dont pay attention to media as propaganda is propaganda, nothing else."
2,Naked women,Attractive naked women in short comedic sketches. Good for a little titillation on a rainy day.
2,Not quite what I was looking for,"The first thing to know about this book is that the author has his heart in the right place. The tone of the book feels just as the title says, like you have a friendly companion helping you out on your journey through the process of writing short stories. Unfortunately, this companion seems to little more than a compilation of several other books, so instead of that friend offering any direct help, it's like he's saying, ""Well, let's get that John Gardner book down from the shelf, and see what he says."" You'd be better off cutting out the middle man and going directly to the source material."
4,Not bad,"An interesting insight into literary devices. I don't entirely agree with the author's opinion, but did enjoy the book overall."
2,"Worth borrowing perhaps, but for me it's not a keeper.","This review is for the first ediion. Mr Bailey covers pretty standard ground in this little book, and in doing so he does do a better job than many other How-To-Write guides. Of course, once you've read a few of these kinds of books, you realise the competition isn't too tough.Unfortunately, Bailey has made his book by endlessly quoting others. Almost all of this book is made up of what other people have said about writing. Flannery O'Connor is quoted again, and again... the same quotes... over and over. Sure, he drives the point home, but Bailey's part is mostly glue and fluff. He seems to have little to say about writing himself.To his credit Bailey has included a pretty good story of his own, and it's the reason he gets two stars from me instead of one. I wanted the author to explain the writing of a short story in his own words, but it seems he didn't feel up to it."
4,The Art of Amy Brown,"It came to me with a little more 'use' than I expected for a book said to be ""very good."" It could have been partly due to mailing as it was in a shrink wrap type of envelope and whenever I get books with little or no protective packaging to them, they have dents or damaged corners."
5,gift for daughter,Purchased this book on fairies for my daughter who loves to draw them.This book is inspirational to her. Well composed book.
5,"AMAZING BOOK, HIGHTLY RECOMMENDED!!","ok, let me start by telling you that I have a huge library of fantasy literature & illustration books. I own just about every fantasy illustrated book out there, but this is that ONE book that I constantly look at. It's like getting around 150 Amy Brown prints for the price of one or two!! Amy's artwork is just amazing, and there's so much detail to each page, that you can look at it for hours. Each page of the book is a full print of Amy's artwork, and most of the pages have a little note of information from Amy about that specific painting.If you love fantasy and fairies, this is a MUST HAVE for your collection. You won't be disappointed in this one.Can't wait for the next one Amy!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,An enjoyable listen,"As a big fan of Garnet's older brother Stan, I sort of naturally came into his music. He has the same rich voice as Stan but does his own thing and doesn't try to be Stan's clone which is to his credit. Stan Rogers fans should check him out due to homage to Stan, but Garnet deserves to be appreciated for who and what he is on his own merit."
5,Great book for youngsters learning about the Stone Age.,"I loved this tale of Malu and her cliff dwelling clan. It combines an accurate picture of the life of Cro Magnon man and the compelling story of a young girl growing up during this primitive time. I was especially impressed with Malu's desires to hunt and train her beloved wolf puppy, Kono. This story will bring the Stone Age to life. It is a good companion to Maroo of the Winter Caves by Turnbull and Wolf Woman by Sherryl Jordan."
3,Useful for 18 years!,"This book was a big part of reason why my 240 DL lasted 18 years. Even though it is limited on many detailed repairs and tries to cover several models and engines, it is sufficient for the weekend mechanic that wants to save money on general maintanence. Great for water pumps, brakes, starters, injectors, tolerances, specs, and emission guidance. Should be used in tandem with the Haynes book to get a clearer understanding and second view on more serious repairs. If things get too tough, I lay the book down and take it to a mechanic. Fortunately, that is a rare event."
1,Useless,"For my 1989 740GL Wagon, this manual is useless. I believe that, in general, Chilton books are useful, but this book simply covers too many models and years to have any level of detail in its instructions. Buy a different book!"
3,Interesting early Nicholson.,"Interesting film about a sexually active man, Studs Lonigan, in Chicago, during the roaring 20's. Christopher Knight is miscast as Studs Lonigan. This was one of Jack Nicholson's first performance's."
3,Textbook reading,"I bought this book because I am an adult beginner in playing music and the wonderful reviews it has. I was disappointed. The book reads much like a textbook, it is very informative and gives a lot of great facts. But don't expect to be inspired by it. It is a great resource book for me, but I was looking for a little more joy and enthusiasm on the subject of music."
2,"Worthy effort, but not that great","I bought this CD with high hopes, but instead was let down. The songs seem all the same, the vocals become very annoying and tiresome. If you really wanna hear a good girl band, check out Kittie...they at least have some talent up their sleeves."
4,"Moms, lock up your boys...the Donnas get skintight!","It amazes me that some people will be overly-critical just because a band is female and wants to rock out. Joan Jett got it, so did L7. But the Donnas are a solid band, and in the day and age of your Limp Bizkits and Korns, we need an honest-to-goodness rock and roll band. This album is proof that the Donnas can kick ass. Anyone who doesn't get it, go listen to your Pennywise and Operation Ivy CD's and quit whining. But for those who want to let their hair down, ""Get Skintight"" is a great record."
5,"Wow! Intense, I am highly impressed!","I just loooved ""I didnt like you anyway' it totally rocked!**B-O-R ing.... too bad you not the boy fer me**But its more of a hyped-up album than a I-feel-mellow disc...."
1,Not very interesting,"They seem to be stuck in a mediocre, sorta rock sorta dull type thing. They should come up with more interesting melodies and lyrics. Ok fine, rockers are dumb, but THIS DUMB? This won't be cute for long."
2,only get this if it's cheap,"if you like older donnas stuff, maybe you'll like this, but i found it somehow lacking. the album was overproduced, and the songs were sort of oomph-less and dull. the donnas used to be awesome because of their attitude and energy, but i guess they lost it when they got skintight. i dont know if amazon carries it but a much better buy would be the electrocutes, who are the donnas before they were donnas."
3,"Fun, unpretentious but nothing exceptional","I wish these women well, they obviously have their hearts in the right place. But I didn't hear anything here that I haven't heard done better before."
2,Lyrics way too dumb and shallow,"Whoever wrote the lyrics to these songs is shallow beyond belief. Not that I am that much less shallow-sitting on the internet and giving my nearly worthless opinion- Their music just rocks in a kind of obvious monkey see monkey do way. Like they took the best of Kiss and the worst of the Ramones, and the worst of cliched suburban boredom and rolled it into a ball. Much ado about nothing."
1,REALLY bad.,"With the exception of ""You Don't Wanna Call,"" which sounds suspiciously like Veruca Salt, there's not a redeeming song on this album. I read somewhere that The Donnas were the new Ramones and the was exciting. To be expecting the new Ramones and getting this garabage was an extraordinary letdown. Where they especially fail is the lyrical content (or lack thereof). There is nothing clever, rebellious, witty, or angry anywhere. No ""Pinhead,"" ""Sheena,"" ""Blitzkrieg Bop."" This is a group of spolied young suburban girls singing about mall culture. Utterly uninteresting and a total waste of time and money."
3,Grrrl Power!,I saw these girls at a bar Friday night and they blew me away. The guitar player was wicked and the lead singer knew how to rev up the crowd. Kind of reminded me of KISS on some songs. Hot Boxin' and Zero are two songs you'll definately want to listen to first.
2,"Kind of rocking, but too cliched","It's fine when you're a little kid to like little rocker Kiss meets Runaways type music, and they do a pretty good job at being just that, but at the same time its very derivative stylistically to that stuff. So the question in my mind is WHY? If the answer is WHY NOT? then so be it- it's a free country. Enjoy yourselves, live and let live. I'm just writing to say that its not the most thrilling thing I've heard. It's not that cute, maybe a little if you like seeing a kid dress up for Halloween. It just seems like they try too hard to live up to that stereotype and should spend more time being real. They're like Kiss but with invisible masks."
3,FormulaRock,"I like girl bands, and I like the Ramones a lot. The Donnas are pretty obviously borrowing the Ramones' recipe for rock - which is, I must say, a very simple one. Don't expect deep insight in this record, but it is fun."
3,HEATHERS revisited,"The Donnas are the Rock 'n Roll version of Heathers. A little bit bad and tad pink, and a whole lot cool and, like, isn't that what it's all about? The songs are crisp, tight and fast as all hell - these girls inject post-high school angst, defiant suburban rebellion and jaded punk rock hijinx into catchy two minute ditties. Songs like the Donna's ode to mind altering contraband (""Hooking it up"") and their brazen approach to casual sex (""Searching the Streets"") blister with pink girlishness. A few numbers seem to chug along and are a bit hindered by Donna A's indifferent vocals, but there are no selections on this album as anthemic as ""Checkin it out"" or ""Rock and Roll Machine,"" and ""Hyperactive."" With previous albums' Ramones inflections toned down in favor of Joan Jettish rock, The Donnas are able to convey with a few licks what a majority of whiny rock singers struggle a whole album to express: unfiltered, ranting punk from the depths of middle class America."
2,Does the world need another Ramones clone?,"I still don't get what the hype is. They seem like a decent Ramones clone with shallow lyrics. Their playing is decent, but the singing is uninspired. The songs are catchy, but really simplistic; the melodies aren't as interesting as maybe something like the Muffs, a much superior ""girl band"". They don't seem to reach the proper level of intensity for a punk band. It just seems like boring, 3-chord rock. Maybe they'd be fun to see live, but I don't see myself slipping their album in at home very often."
1,I liked it at first,It was interesting at first but I found myself filing it away after 1 or 2 listens. It lost its charm. Very disposable. Sorry to say.
2,Be careful and read the sizes,"I got these knobs to replace my broken crock pot knob. I thought I had read the dimensions correctly before purchasing, but apparently not. When these arrived, I realized they were entirely too small for my crock pot and really too small for anything else in my kitchen that might need replacement knobs. As such, I'm not really sure what they are supposed to replace and I do not recommend them."
4,replacement knobs,"A small knob went missing on my Frigidaire range. Appliance parts stores wanted about $60.00 (YES, sixty) for an OEM replacement. Aaaaargh. I bought a set of these Fitz All and it solved my problem."
2,Slow cooker knobs,That did not fit my slow cooker. I don't know any other products in my household that I could use these for.
4,"good, but compared to the broadways-","it just doesn't stand, much like the lawrence arms albums. if you took the best songs by both bands and combined them on one lp, it still wouldn't even equal a broadways album. the honor system is dan's band, and is a lot more layed back and polished sounding. i can't think of one aggressive part on this whole album however, and the lyrics aren't as motivating. it's essential to any broadways/slapstick/tricky dick/lawrence arms fans, but not for the uninitiated."
4,a step beyond the broadways?,"i figured that the honor system had their work cut out for them after the lawrence arm's ""a guided tour..."" and the notably matured ""ghost stories"" and the honor system offering is quite good. however, i don't think there was too much of a stylistic jump made from the broadways transistion--which bothers me because who wants to listen to the broadways without Brendan Kelly. also, this sounds nothing like the Foo Fighters!!"
4,Fun Disney Christmas shorts.,"A rare opportunity to see several Disney Christmas-y shorts in one place. I miss the Santa Claus one, though, that was on a similar (though shorter) VHS collection from the 1980s."
1,Beware,"I made the mistake of not watching this before allowing my 3.5 year old to. I don't consider myself overprotective, but these stories have a kid abusing a dog (Pluto), a kid having his pants pulled down and being spanked over someone's knee (including showing the kid's bottom from above), and Donald chasing Chip & Dale with a revolver in the first 2 cartoons among other things. I turned it off after that. Talked to several other friends to see if I was overreacting & they recall seeing that kind of stuff when we were little but all agreed they don't want their toddlers seeing it anytime soon. Was a little surprised this made it out of Disney especially in today's day & time....May be okay for older kids, but I don't really want to explain guns or why it's not funny/okay to abuse our dogs to my 3.5 year old."
3,relax,"This is not meant to be a major artistic statement. The Walkmen had already released an official album in 2006, ""A Hundred Miles Off"". This was just a fun record for the band to put together as their private studio, Mercata, was closing. It's comparable to Camper Van Beethoven's take on Fleetwood Mac's Tusk. No, it's not a great record, but it's pretty fun and crazy and interesting to listen to. As always, Hamilton Leithauser is a truly unique and exciting vocalist, and the band does manage at times to capture its usual otherworldly atmospherics. Buy it used. It's worth it."
4,Please only review albums if you've actually listened to them with an open mind.,"I wouldn't even give a Britney Spears album ""one star."" There are probably only one or two albums in existence for which a one-star rating would be valid. Please check this album out for yourself at Napster or any other free listening site, then maybe actually THINK about what you want to say about spilling garbage all over these pages. Thank you.Now for my review: ""Pussy Cats"" may not be the best Walkmen album, but it's up there. This is loose, wild fun-- obviously in keeping with the original sessions on which this album is based. Speaking of the original sessions, the versions here are significantly different from Nilsson's as to make them worth their own separate purchase. Should you need to know anything more, please listen to the album for yourself instead of reading our opinions. It would be an infinitely better use of your time."
4,Cedar Plank,Very satisfied with the Quality & Workmanship of the Cedar Plank.We have used it in baking fish and tenderloins. Excellent taste to both fish & meat. Thoroughly enjoy.
4,A great rock cd,"I think too many people place emphasis on the fact that the Benjamin Gate are a Christian band. So what? Rock music is rock music. Leave it that. That being said, as rock cd's go, this is a solid effort. I picked it up on a whim one day because it looked interesting and had a female singer. I was totally blown away by the first song ""Lift Me Up"". Great guitar-based song with a catchy chorus. And, it didn't stop there. Every song is catchy and rocking. My favorties: ""Lift Me Up"", ""Calling"", ""Do What You Say"", a great cover of Men At Work's ""Overkill"", ""Light""... it's such a great cd.I don't know who to compare Benjamin Gate to. The closest I could get would be maybe saying that Evanescence kind of has a sound like Benjamin Gate. These songs could easily be on the Modern Rock charts. It's too bad this is the last cd the band will be putting out. The lead singer is getting married, so they're breaking up at the end of 2003. Check this cd out, I don't think you'll be disappointed."
3,good book but out-of-date,"I am currently planning to have a home birth, so I bought this book after having already done some research into home birth. I'm based in London, but my edition was a US version so some information wasn't relevant. The spirit of the book is generally uplifting and inspiring. I bought a used edition without realising that it was from 1991; lots have changed since then, particularly regarding maternity wards, so I found that the biggest downside of the book is that it feels ""out-of-date"", slightly too feminist for the 21st century first time mum. Having said that, I found that the real strenght of the book was givng practical advice on positions during labour etc. There is lots of information about it around, but in this book you could really hear the experienced and passionate midwife speak."
3,Maybe not totally up to date but helpful all the same.,"If you are just diving into SWG or a returning veteran like myself you will probably find this book helpful. It is fairly basic so if you are looking for something in depth this is not it however it does have stats on all the beasties, NPC's, and most professions. Because it is older it has nothing about the BEAST MASTER profession, that one you get to figure out on your own. If you can find a used copy of this book in good shape (thats what I did) it is worth the small investment. I keep it handy as a reference guide to what beasts are where in the galaxie since I am in the process of leveling a Beast Master on one of my toons."
4,May be outdated but still helpful,"This book might not be up to date in every aspect of the game, but being a new player it has been invaluable. Online guides seem to be more outdated than the book. If you are new to this game, this book is a great help and a great reference."
1,Not worth buying...,"SWG is going off-line forever in early December of 2011. It had a good run, but it's done now and this book isn't going to be good for much except nostalgia."
2,Not worth it.,"While this guide does give you the basics, it is not complete. With an ever changing game, this guide is behind. I have found more helpful information from other players then this book."
2,Some interesting erotic art presented by two creeps.,"Much of the art presented in this video is actually quite well chosen (for this ""genre""), and it is interesting to think about the cultural/historical context of the pieces. But don't expect -too- much exploration of social themes in this video. The art is showcased by two creeps who, throughout the video, create inane banter to ""compliment"" the pieces. While the woman does bring up a bit of the cultural context of some of the pieces, the man mainly smiles creepily, giggles and makes childish jokes. I'm not sure if this video is intended as a serious (although brief) discourse on the legitimacy of erotic themes in fine and pop art, but it seems to fall short of it's mark, if such was truely intended. Expect a lot of terrible graphics and music, and get ready to feel nauseous whenever your hosts smile and say ""I love you."""
3,New Directions for Equity in Mathematics Education,"This book is ok. I bought it to use for a term paper on curricular and methodological differences in math education across social classes, and was really hoping to find some juicy material in this book as the title was so promising. The book is probably ok, but I was disappointed that it was a set of journal articles rather than one cohesive narrative. One would not be able to tell that from the blurb on the back. In this case, caveat emptor."
2,Pass this up,"I bought this book in an attempt to save some money -- I was also considering First Aid, but didn't want to spend more than 20 bucks given how much money has already gone into this silly test. Unfortunately, my gamble didn't pay off. This book is alright - has a basic overview of the test format and what to expect as well as 20 sample cases. However, I recently took a peek at a copy of First Aid for CS, and found it to be much more complete. It has several very simple and high-yield test taking tips that Blueprints lacks, and has much more thorough explanations of the sample cases. So I sucked it up and forked over some money for a used copy of First Aid, and feel like I will be better prepared. I also realized that, given the expenditure on this test, I'd rather invest a few extra bucks in my study materials to ensure I don't have to retake this sucker."
3,Goodbetterbest,This book is good but by no means the best. Its an ok book to get a different perspective from the traditional step 2 CS books. I will recommend for those looking to have a broader view of the step 2 CS.
4,Interesting but not informative.,"I really want to like this film but it has some flaws. The film quality is not great so some of the audio is hard to hear. I think that a lot of footage could have been edited down a bit to avoid some long, often times, boring scenes of Storm and Jinjee playing music and rock climbing.I also hoped for information regarding detoxing, transitioning from cooked vegan to high raw, etc.Complaints aside, this film is beautiful to watch, the family is healthy, strong and active. As a child of the '70's and '80's who grew up watching tons of t.v. eating sugary cereals and chef boyardee I could see the difference in the health of these children and my own childhood that was riddled with ear aches and other illnesses.I think that if you are interested in the raw food lifestyle this is a must-see, however, split the cost with friends or loan it to others. I probably would only watch it once."
3,"Good cookbook, but really not rush-hour recipes","I love Sara. I learned a lot about cooking from watching her show religiously. Then I had two kids and had to adjust my cooking style. By the time I get around to cooking dinner, I am exhausted and hungry. But these recipes are NOT simple. They all have long lists of ingredients and multiple steps. I am not going to make toasted breadcrumbs! I do not have time to roast bell peppers for a weeknight meal! Roasted game hens with stuffing and gravy? Are you kidding me? That is never going to be a weeknight meal at my house! There are some attractive recipes here but not much I would attempt on a weeknight."
5,Fantastic!!,"Wow! Sara has some fabulous recipes in here! Our faves include beer batter & the pizza dough! We've tried making pizza dough before with little success...now, we make this once a week! The pizza dough freezes well - cook 6 minutes, let cool & wrap in plastic! This dough is so easy & great that we cannot stand to make a frozen pizza or order take-out! Lots of great recipes! Thank you, Sara!!!"
1,"""Weeknight meals"" with ingredients I've never heard of","I had watched Sara's cooking programs on PBS and enjoyed her dishes and great personality, but when I ordered her cookbooks, I was SO disappointed. There were virtually no photos of the dishes, and there was nothing ""every day"" about the ingredients. Many of them I had never heard of and certainly could not find in my local grocery store. I'm not sure who cooks these dishes for ""weeknight meals."" I wish I had spent my money on a standy-by like Taste of Home or Betty Crocker!"
3,"Okay, but no pictures","I really like Sara. I think she has a great mastery of cooking quick, simple and delicious meals. However, I am also a fan of beautiful cookbooks, and I find it hard to decide whether or not I want to make the meal without being able to look at a picture of the food. They say we eat with our eyes first, and that makes sense to me. So if you're like me, you might want to go to the bookstore so you can check out the book before buying it."
1,Not Happy!!,This item was shipped to me late and once arrived two of the CDs had scratches on them. I don't think it's worth the price.
2,A pseudo-learning tool that is behind the modern technology.,"For the amount of money you pay, it isn't really worth it. There is no booklet to go along with the tapes, and they cover very shallow level of the subjects. Plus, in this age of CD's and DVD's, these audio tapes are archaic, and if you want to focus your study on certain sections, you will spend most of your time fast forwarding or rewiding the tapes."
3,"Does the job, but...","This item serves its purpose, but the design could have been executed better. Firstly, your low voltage & high voltage wires are barely isolated from each other. If you get the one with the rubber grommet it doesn't want to stay put and the edges of the plate are so rough you can easily slit the low voltage wires when putting them through. Also There is very little room in the box to bend the electric wires into after wiring to the outlet. Which is probably why they give you sleeves to cover the ground wire so you don't create shorts in the wiring or the circuit board when you cram everything in."
1,Worst POS Ever Made,"I bought this movie and wanted to put it in a shredder. Actually you cant even call this horrible product a movie, more like some talentless hacks with a cam corder. This was the worst thing I have ever purchased. There should be a law when idiot's make a so called movie to know what they are doing. Its boring and do not waste your money on this. The exciting part is when some geek steals this so called actresses lip stick and the boys toss it around and dont let her have it, its sad, aweful, really bad. Id rather watch paint dry then see this again, aagghh."
1,An absolute disappointment,"I purchased this knife set because most of the reviews claimed is was good quality for the price. What a disappointment! There was absolutely no edge on ""any"" of the knives. I could run my finger up and down the blade with no worry of being cut! I gave this item as a gift and was embarrassed. I returned it within three days."
1,Dissappointing quality,"I read through lots of reviews about this product at Amazon.com, so I felt confident about buying it. I can't tell you how much I was disspointed after I used them a couple of times. I have to sharpen them before every single use!!! My 10 old Henckels are sharper than my new knives. And I like to cook, so I'm quite picky about my cookware and tools. My husband put 1 knife into dishwasher by mistake and it came out all rusty!!! I wouldn't recommend it even to beginner cooks. Next time I'll spend more money and get Henckels again. Bottom line: save your money and get better quality knives."
2,Good Knives.. except when they get rusty,"These knives do the job and are very sharp... but:You must wash AND dry the knives immediately after use.Without doing that, you will get rust spots on the knives.It already happened to a few of the steak knives for me. It doesn't come off completely, so be careful!"
4,The knifes are great!,The knifes are great. The only thing that was a bit dissapointing was how long they took to get to my house.
2,Not so good,"They are beginning to rust.... and a little too heavy, not very balanced. I would not recommend this product, even though the price is really low. You're better off spending a little more for a quality product."
2,Edge,I did like the feel and weight of the the set but they didn't seem to hold an edge and had to use the sharping steel quite often and the steak knife had more of a sawing effect than slicing
5,Well appreciated,"As an avid reader of Henri Nouwen, I appreciate the care and integrity used in this compilation. I feel it gets at the sense of who Nouwen was and the sense of his spiritual journey. His compassion and humility shine through."
4,The Only Necessary Thing: Living a Prayerful Life,"The book ordered was an encourager for me,prayer is a necessity in all of our lives.The service was very well thank you for your help."
2,Product Description,"I use to have these sunglasses but I lost them, I liked so much that I bought it again but this time from this seller. When the sunglasses arrived to my hands I realize that my NEW bolle mongrel were made in China while my OLD bolle mongrel were made in France. The finishes of my old bolle were excelent, the frame quality was excellent too, in the other hand the chinese sunglasses finishes are terrible, the ""paint job"" is with air bubbles! and the frame is made of some cheap plastic. DON'T BUY IT FROM THIS SELLER"
3,Disappointing in E-Book Format.,"I read this novel back in 1985. I loved it then. When I saw it was available as an E-Book, I was happy that I could get a copy of my own--the copy I read belonged to the Public Library. However, having read a bit over half of the E-Book, I am a bit disappointed with it. There are syntactic errors in great abundance in the script. Also I would guess that approximately 20% of the""I""s in the script are replaced with the number ""1"".The errors are not sufficient to impede understanding of the script or the plot, but are prominent enough to be annoying when they interrupt the flow of reading."
2,Correct title: Cacti and no other succulents,"The title is misleading in that this book describes no other form of succulents outside cacti. The pictures are generally small and too many are closeups that show what a particular feature of the plant looks like, but not the entire plant. The descriptions are short and a bit weak, as well."
3,Cactus y ¿Suculentas?,"Buen material grafico, datos y excelente calidad. Pero no existen descripciones de suculentas"
1,Simon & Schuster Guide to Cactus and Succulents,"If I had looked through this book before buying it online I never would have wasted the money on it. Nomenclature is totally out-of-date, temperature guides are just plain wrong, pictures are okay for close up but useless as to identifying overall form and structure. Since so many cactus are mis-identified or misnamed the pics don't help in identification without a more accurate book to cross-reference the plant name with. In terms of coverage of the cactus family this book is woefully inadequate. Entire genuses are omitted and/or only have one plant covered when there are actually dozens of species."
2,Overly technical,"While this book contains a huge amount of information on cacti, the information on individual cacti is so technically oriented that the book is unsuitable for almost everyone except trained biologists and gardeners (and I have a PhD in astronomy, so I am very familiar with reading scientific literature). The cacti are organized by their latin names, with common names rarely given. Much of the information on the individual cacti is only relevant to identifying or cultivating the cacti. In contrast, such things as the Audobon field guides on birds and mammals present at least small amounts of information on the physiology and behavior of the species listed. The photos are of mediocre quality, and close-up photos of some cacti do not aid in identification. The one saving grace of this book is its introduction, which is written in a lighter style and which presents thorough background information on cacti. Nonetheless, I would recommend other books before this one."
4,Pretty good guide,"I bought this because I have a cactus & succulent collection and wanted to i.d. some of them. The pictures are very colorful and clear, and the descriptions of the plant are always next to the picture on the facing page. It shows the temperatures the plant tolerates, the origin, cultivation, and the shape (or habit) of the plant. Many of the pics show the plant in flower.My only complaints are that there isn't as many succulents as there are cacti listed, and they don't list the plant's common name - only the scientific name. Plus many of the pics are close-ups so you don't get to see the whole plant. Otherwise it's a great book at an affordable price."
5,Best Cactus Photo Guide,This book has the best photos I have ever seen. The descriptions are wonderful but if you collect cactus you know that pictures are the defining way to know exactly what you have. This book is #1 for me.
1,Simon & Schuster's Guide to Catci & Succulents,"I know that Cacti are succulents, but what about the other succulents?? There is no mention of plants which are succulents but not cacti. I am going to return this book, as it certainly is not complete according to its title."
3,Check the references....find the scripture,"I enjoyed the book. It does a good job of making Peter real. However, I found some of the speculation disconcerting and in checking some of the points with Strong's concordance and the scipture itself, I found the scholarship some what weak. (Jesus never calling Peter by the name Peter....Peter cutting off the ear lobe, not the ear...and so on.) I had a few to many questions to accept everything is this book.Lots of good points, though, and it was written with passion for Jesus and for Peter!"
5,HoLlA At Yo BoY,This Is The hardest CD by my [Boy] E FEEZE the whole Cd Bangin I reccommended u Cop that CDHOLLA AT YO BOY
4,E FEEZY,This was a great effort by E 40..Once again 40 shows why he is one of the top rappers out there...I would have to say he is the most influential artist today...My personal favorites are Fallin Rain a track where 40 goes back in time to reflect on life before rap and his independent start in the rap game...Roll On is very catchy featuring Afro Man and B Legit...Why they dont f**k with us opens the albulm with a tight ... beat...The Slap...Way above average song...MY Cup featuring Suga T is the knock (slap)...Til the DAwn.. producer Bosko does it again...Lifestyles...40 once again is a few notches above the competition....Great overall effort
5,Indeed she is!,"Brave, honest and personal, Kristi tells her stories with amazing depth and range - both emotional and vocal. Loose, funky,upbeat,dramatic or sweet, her keyboard stylings take you to unexpected and intimate places. And in her recorded work, you get the pleasure of not just one, but many Kristis, as she layers on fascinating tracks to harmonize with herself! If you're Brave Enough to step into this indie goddess's world, you'll be treated to an lyrical ride of heart opening proportions."
3,Beer fuelled despair rock at its best,When I bought this cd I did not expect it to top any other of their releases such as their previous full length A guided tour of Chicago. I was very very wrong. This album still contains the raw yet melodic intensity that I like them for. A few of the songs are a little softer than before but they still rock
3,Better than the last,"The mastering on this disc is a lot better than ""Guided tour"". They have a more in-your-face sound on this disc and more mature sound then their last release. If you like the broadways, you may like this disc. Check out the Honor system if you liked the Broadways as well."
4,OOOOO Scary,This is Lawrence arms second album and it improves on the first. Chris gets a few songs on this one but they are different from apathy and exhaustion or greates story ever told because th music isn't as emo. Brendan plays a pretty mean bass on this album and has some wonderful basslines which is pretty much ignored after this album. Just great energetic songs that will have you smiling and feeling good. i would recommend this as a god starting point for newcomers i 'll just warn you this album is raw but if you listen to punk especially indie punk then you'll be used to it.
1,Don't bother or waste your money,This book is truly one of the worst I've read. Completely full of mis=leading half truths and out right lies. Take a past and save your money
1,A joke,This book contains nothing but a one-sided compilation of liberal propaganda. It's an absolute joke.
1,"One-sided, and not very persuasive.","Not much here. From the title you'd expect some sort of scholarly analysis, but it's actually just a transcript of people who agree with each other saying that guns and the NRA are bad -- over and over and over again. A waste of time and money"
1,"A ""feel-good"" handbook for the firearm prohibitionist","the authors of this book have developed an ingenious strategy for dealing with the recent Second admendment scholarship: ignore it. It is a masterpiece of propaganda and a good study on how fallacies are applied such as: Appeals to improper authority, Ad Hominem, Slippery Slopes, Red Herrings, straw man, and the Faulty Analogy. In short, the book is a piece of trash."
3,Glaring Ommison,"I love the fan collective sets, even more so since I found them at Big Lots for $5 each. However how the Klingon set can not have DS9's ""Blood Oath"" is a glaring omission. It brings back all three original Klingons from the original series for Grabthar's hammer sake. Someone at Paramount should get a bat'leth up the wazzoo for that SNAFU! ""The Sword of Kahless"" could have been cut instead. And the FANS picked these? What fans? Anything like the ""TOP MEN"" from ""Raiders of the Lost Ark""? I remember the Toledo Blade did a piece on Star Wars and Star Trek fans. Not surprisingly I knew far more about Star Wars then their ""Star Wars experts"" but I ALSO knew far more about TREK then their ""expert Trekkers""."
4,Kah Plah!,Fan Collective is great. How many of us want to spend a bunch of bucks for a whole season when we really just want the episodes with Klingons?My only gripe with this collection is that it's too small. There were many other cool episodes out there that this collection missed. :(Search online time.
3,"A ""Klingon"" collection without the SNG episode ""Ethics"" is incomplete","The episode ""Ethics"" is one of the best Star Trek episodes, hands down. It is also a classic prompter for anyone in healthcare studying decision analysis. It presents another side of Klingon/Worf's character that is missing from the other episodes. This box is sorely deficient for leaving the episode ""ethics"" out."
3,Could have been more glorious!,"The Klingon culture is by far the most interesting one in the ST Universe.The Tribble double play episodes were not needed. What about when Worf went to Boroth? What about when Worf killed Gowron on DS9? What is the fascination with the Tribbles? I bought this collection, and I'm not totally disappointed, but it could have been alot better. Disc 2 defines the collection for me."
5,Looking forward for this box set!,"I'm so looking forward for this Star Trek box set. I already have the Borg and Time Travel ones. I also plan to get the Q one. Although the episode list for the Klingon set is not known yet I would like to offer the 10 stories that I believe could be included:1) Broken Bow - Enterprise2) Affliction & Divergence - Enterprise3) Errand Of Mercy - The Original Series4) Day Of The Dove - The Original Series5) Sins Of The Father - The Next Generation6) Reunion - The Next Generation7) Redemption Parts I & II - The Next Generation8) Blood Oath - Deep Space Nine9) The Way Of The Warrior - Deep Space Nine10) Apocalypse Rising - Deep Space NineKeep in mind that, as in the previous sets, we get 10 stories, not 10 episodes. This is because the two-parters count as 1 single story.Of course, there's more Klingon stories, including Voyager's ""Faces"" which I love, but I believe these eps are the ones that are more in tone with the entire Klingon arc. What do you think?"
2,Fan choices?,"In brief, I seriously doubt these were the Fan choices. I'd guess Paramount had their thumb on the scale, and they wouldn't include all the best episodes if that would hurt the season set collections sales. The inclusion of the Voyager episode makes that obvious.Priced as a four disc set, though they could have easily fit everything on three, two if you dump the Enterprize and Voyager episodes."
2,T-Fal pan set,I am not that happy with these pans as they scratch very easily. I have bought many T-Fals in the past and was very happy with them. I guess there are different grades and quality. They do cook well but I don't like that they are scratched. If you get them be very careful with them.
1,Don't Recommend - Waste of Money,This book is not very informative and doesn't spend any time explaining the baby's development. The majority of each page is filled with blank lines for you to write your feelings each day and most of us don't have the extra time or energy for that.
2,"Not bad, but not great either.","I've read widely in books on this topic, and I'd have to say this one is more superficial than some others that are equally available. Not a time-waster, but you come away with ""helpful hints"" rather than the realistic nurturing and empowering you need in order to be able to act in a time of grieving."
1,A new meaning for boring,"This is the quintessential Tavener: boring in a new, as yet unknown dimension. Pretentious? Yes, absolutely. Celestial? By no means. It belongs to the kingdom of Morpheus. Go aPart if you are seeking for true emotion. Besides, we will always have the Leipzig kantor."
1,Waste of Time,"I've had email communications with Koreto and found him to be arrogant, surley, and intolerant of anyone who doesn't agree with him.Also, I'm familiar with some of his ""experts"" who post their drivel on Koreto's magazine's website. As a financial professional, I wouldn't want anything that they have to offer."
3,Long on Hype short on answers,"Clockspeed is a good example of the thirst for books on eCommerce. The premise of the book is largely based around a cute concept ""clockspeed"" with a call to concurrently engineer process, product, and supply chains. All good premises, however, the author does little to tell you how those should fit together in pragmatic terms. The book is most helpful for people in manufacturing where all of the examples are from and not people working in the services markets, where clockspeed has some real meaning. A visit to the authors web site is futher demoralizing as Fine has decided to set up a consulting practice around the concept and book. Overall this is not the best book I've read on working in the electronic economy."
5,Every startup company CEO should read this book.,"Charley Fine's contribution in Clockspeed is his unique combination of an analysis of the development speed of different industries with his ""double helix"" description of the industry trends toward vertical integration or its opposite. Understanding these trends and the pace of the evolution of your ""ecological habitat"" and gaining value chain advantage in your chosen niche is vitally important to high tech startups whose very lives depend on operating at maximum clockspeed. I am recommending the book to my venture partners and to every startup we are considering for investment."
5,one of Marian's finest,"I have quite a few Marian McPartland records, including a number of her live dates, and was reluctant to buy yet another one; however, this collection taken from a one-night stand in September 1979 at New York's Carlyle Hotel is exceptional. As much as I enjoy some of McPartland's later live dates, including the sets from Yoshi's (1995), the ""Reprise"" of the Hickory House Trio (1999) and the Shanghai Jazz club (2001), they don't have the same edge as this evening captured at the Carlyle. As marvelous as McPartland's pianism continued to be well into her 80's, she sounds far more energetic and imaginative in 1979.The recorded sound is excellent; and there's no flaw present in my copy of this cd as referenced by another amazon reviewer, nor does the applause fade away detracting from the sense of a club date as also mentioned in a review.Five stars."
1,Dynatrap Company is problematic,"The company that makes Dynatrap appears to be going out of business, which we didn't find out until after we purchased the replacement bulbs. They do not answer any of our correspondence regarding repairs needed on the ballast of the Dynatrap, and according to the local newspaper (they are actually based in our hometown) they appear to be going out of business. So beware of purchases related to your Dynatrap!"
2,bug buster,"As difficult as it is to counter the attack of flying insects, the difficulty replacing and DynaTrap Blub is without peer."
4,Gotta have it,Nice to have the replacement handy zi far so good let see how long it last per bulb. Comments about seeing delightful
2,Low quality/poor life,"This is the forth pair of bulbs I purchased for Dynatrap.One pair was good and lasted a whole season.Another pair lasted only about a couple of weeks.Two pairs came with broken connector ends. I managed to solder the ends but the bulbs only lasted a couple of months.Packaging is flimsy, so maybe they are getting damaged in shipping."
2,bulbs for a Dynatrap,"I purchased these bulbs probably about a month ago, but one has gone out already. They are suppose to last for 3000 hours, but one burned out the other is still going, but the ends are starting to turn dark. I thought they were new, but maybe not. I have never had a problem with anything I've ordered before, but this is a little different, especially if they were new. I threw the boxes out, so I don't know and I don't remember the order type."
4,just got it,just got it and hung it up. seems to work as advertised but i have not had it long enough to give a fair evaluation. thanks for the quick devivery.
4,Fantastic older exercise tape set!,1980s/90s early workout tape by Minneapolis ( I believe) sports celeb Leslie Chazin. This is a great 2 tape set with a nice easy to follow low impact aerobics tape and a great light weight training tape. The weight training has particularly good attention to form and detail. This was the tape that turned me on to lifting weights - you will find yourself firming and trimming down in no time flat! Great for beginners and those who want a change. Ms Chazin is easy to listen to and a great instructor.
5,Unforgetable,"The title say's it all Unforgetable. Alley and Ethan went thru denial of their feelings. They felt used and didn't won't to really say what was in their hearts. I didn't won't Alley to loose the baby, they struggled and glad at the end they listen to their hearts, would like a sequal of letting us know she had many children and other trials of interference from other's in their lives."
3,Way of clumsy,"My son loves this truck in the Thomas series what also was the reason for buying it.The toy is overall quite well build and the steel cab and chasis finish makes it look quite detailed and cute.The biggest flaw is the plastic bed which went off the truck in first 30 seconds of playing. Though it's easy to click it back, the not even 45degrees angle makes it going off very soon again. Kids just expect it to go further.It does not match the wooden trails gauge, which I do not consider to be a big problem as it iss logically not supposed to ride on the trails. However its magnetic hitch motivates kids to try to join it to the trains."
1,Not impressive at all!,"The pianist didn't have much expression, feeling, or dynamics. For example, the Russian Dancer can't make my family feel dancing and the whole song is just very plain."
3,Still good...,"but no growth from the first album ""So Sudden"". I feel like they could have added the three best songs from Like Vines to So Sudden and called that a GREAT album.Don't get me wrong, this is a great band and a good album. But So Sudden was a GREATER album.This band is AMAZING live. Don't pass up a chance to see them in person. They really rock the house."
4,Stunningly fresh,"Ten seconds into this album I had the unmistakable feeling that I was stumbling across something I'd be sure to love. The Hush Sound has an absolutely fresh sound, both instrumentation (including the ocassional well-coordinated piano, unusual guitar riffs) and vocal performance (alternating male and female, sometimes appearing together). The overall appeal is excellent.Like Vines is difficult to label. They are perhaps somewhere between the indie pop appeal of Ben Folds, Fountains of Wayne, and the mellodic power pop performances of Panic! At The Disco. Their influences are clearly varied.The one weak point not to be escaped is the sophomoric lyric composition, with whole songs repeating inanities like, ""Sweet tangerine, will you please come back to me? / Cause I don't think that these feelings are gonna leave."" That aside, this is a refreshing listen of which no music fan should deprive himself."
5,Just like camping!,"The Kanteen is wonderful! It feels like the camping days when I was a kid drinking out of a kanteen. Be careful...it becomes either really cold or really hot depending on the liquid you put in it. It is very easy to clean. The sport top works nicely for grabbing it really quick. I love being able to drink out of a bottle that does not have potential plastics leaking into the water I drink. We can't control all that we consume, but it is worth trying. Enjoy!"
4,An interesting insight,"This is a book full of character and characters of an age that will not be seen again. The relationships between employer and employee of an era where etiquette and manners were all too important. It provides the reader with a real feeling of how the hunting circle worked and how a man devoted to his job through his love for the hounds and the countryside dealt with the changing landscape and attitudes over the decades. Well worth every penny, and a must have for anyone intested in foxhunting and country pursuits."
5,I had the pleasure of reading some of Valdas' other writings,"I must say that the man is indeed a controversial mind compared to other brilliant writers. His vieuw on the social systems worldwide is so profound & his ideas very well documented that this work will most certainly shake up the all American concience. Even as a Western European I often feel the blood boil in my vains, but at the end of each essay I mostly had to admit: ""My goodness, he was right after all"". The abstracts of his latest book - I found on his website- give you an impression of his talents. Thou his style reads easily, it does grabs you by the nuts & pulls you with both your feet back on the ground. Certainly not a book for socially anorexic citizens. His writings give a deep vieuw into the American heart & rip off the mask of a society in distress!"
3,Too Thick,I was not too happy with this item. It was too thick and hard to apply. I would not use it agaqin. Sorry.
1,Not for me!,"I'm from West Virginia. I have all my teeth, didn't marry my cousin, and actually went to college. I find items such as this EXTREMELY offensive!"
3,Good nipple and works for Playtex ventaire bottles too,"I am using Playtex Ventaire and Dr Browns bottles. I used stage 1 nipples for my newborn son and he was choking as the milk flow was too fast. I was able to use these nipples only after he was 3 months old and its working pretty good. It was nice that the nipples fit perfectly on the Playtex Ventaire bottles as the ones I used initially are slow flow and per the reviewers that fast flow nipples were too fast for their babies.Pros1. Fits Ventaire bottles.2. Does not collapse while feeding3. NOT made in China, says made in Germany.Cons1. Stage 1 nipples hard to find in the store unless buying the bottles too.2. I think it caused nipple confusion once introduced but I realised late so will definitely get the wide neck bottles with nipples next time."
3,Very cute,I think this movie is a gangsta/love story. It shows how a person can be heartless and have a heart at the same time.
1,You can't be serious!!!!!!,"I can't believe the other reviewers who said this is a good movie. I suspect Treach and his mom wrote some of the reviews. The storyline was bad, the acting was bad, the dialogue was bad and even the fight scenes were bad. Come on now, there was one scene where Treach was breakdance shooting with his gun. And that's not even the worst part of the movie. Don't waste your time unless you could use a good laugh."
3,loved the frontal,"This movie was good. Worth watching. Worth buying. Decent acting and actors. The plot a little far fetched but still good.Ladies definite plus was the FULL FRONTAL nude, strip scene with Treach. Too bad is wasn't longer and closer. The scene that is!!"
5,"Fantastic fit, everything as advertised!","I've had these visors on my 2002 Ford Ranger for over a year now, and they've performed exactly as advertised through all seasons, cold, hot, wet, dry, etc. They fit perfectly, install in seconds, and have been very durable. I highly recommend them."
1,Disappointment,The left side broke during install. Ordered AWS parts. I told EGR about the problem. The box was gone so I could not return the items and did not want to worry about it. Just call it a lesson and buy locally.
5,Marillion's intro of Steve Hogarth,"Excellent!!!This cd is a fabulous more emotional and wonderful new direction for Marillion,,with the intro of new singer Steve Hogarth replacing Fish as the frontman for the band,,this cd is fantastic.fans took to Hogarth right off and i find the band to be much better and deeper than before.Every song is great from the opening ""king of sunset town"" to final ""the space"" hoarth shows he has a voice and is a very talented songwriter.""seasons end"" is quite a beautiful song,""after me"" is a more poppy rocky tune but is great,""Berlin"" is a darker more powerful song where H.shows his vocal talents with a slightly peter gabriel sound and ""The Space"" ends the cd perfectly..steve rothery is at his usual greatness on quitar and each member is amazing.i have all marillions music and its all great ..not a bad song on this disc go but this cd now and welcome to the wonderful world of Marillion...very highly recommed this cd!!defienlty one of the very best bands there is!!"
4,Excellent book,"The book is really good, no problems at all. It looks like new. Very satisfied with that. All the pages are ok, it's perfect."
1,A Hole In My Head/The Music of Losers,"Lukewarm at best, sounding like satire at worst, this is bloodless, clammy music. I regret buying this CD-- there's one worthwhile track on the album, which is ""Over You."" I heard it in a Starbucks in Chicago.Some songs on this disc actually make me cringe: with lyrics like ""Here's a toast to the underdogs/the little boats lost in the fog/the ones who don't quite fit the mould/who never do what they are told,"" Brave Parade tops that list. Other tracks tend towards similar schlock, with an attempt to mine the same shaft that a Coal Miner's Daughter could in ""Black Flowers."" However, Miles is incredibly unbelievable with her brand of painful Americana, her lyricism being thin and her old guitar tiresome.If I could keep it from having a star at all, I would."
5,Great speedbuilding book,"I used this book for school. I had the edge trimmed off and put 3 holes in so I could use a binder. Now that I've graduated, I go back to this book for review."
4,good 2fer!!,this is a good 2 in 1 soundtrack disc. both are very funky and at 27 tracks you can't beat it.staffino
5,Flies for fun & PROFIT!,"Everyone at the Gilded Lilly Country Club (especially Blain and Buffy, grrr) thought that it was funny that I bought this book with my very last 23 million, but I myself will have the last laugh! Amongst the pressed flies (thoughtfully included by the author in the appendix section), I found a 40 million dollar bill! Who will be laughing when I deposit it at the bank tomorrow!Cha-Ching!"
1,Another books was gooder instead of this here one.,"I liked these here ones more better:A Fly Went BySam and the FireflyBecause a Little Bug Went Ka-Choo! (Beginner Books(R))The Fly That Went On VacationFLY WENT BY, A, I Can Read it All By Myself, Beginner Books[[ASIN:1880808056[[ASIN:0963529900 Excuse Me Waiter, There's a Fly in My Soup!]][[ASIN:0898159776[[ASIN:0898159776 Eat-a-bug Cookbook: 33 ways to cook grasshoppers, ants, water bugs, spiders, centipedes, and their kin]]I got ALL THESE and still have monies left over for crayons and Play-Dough!!"
4,What knock-outs can tell you,"This is a wonderful summary of that which we have learned from genetic knock-out and knock-in technology. There is a systemic evaluation of even the earliest cell divisions and the results are clear: knock-out or knock-in a gene, and the patterns change. Even axial organization of the egg can be influenced by knocking out a gene.The focus is entirely on making sense of the drosophila with knock-out and knock-in experiments . Fundamental research into initiating metabolic activity, surface chemistry and protein assembly is not addressed."
3,Not bad if you can't afford a real present,"I was considering this book until I came across others which are today considered much more valuable:1.Streams in the Desert by Mrs. Charles E. Cowman (Nov 30, 0002)(122 customer reviews)Formats Buy new New from Used fromHardcover$600,000,000.002.Hero For Our Time - An Intimate Story of the Kennedy Years (Jan 1, 1984)Formats Buy new New from Used fromUnknown Binding$600,000,000.003.POINT COUNTER POINT by Aldous Huxley (1928)Formats Buy new New from Used fromHardcover$900,000,000.004.Lana, The Lady, The Legend, The Truth by Lana Turner (1991)(11 customer reviews)Formats Buy new New from Used from Collectible fromPaperback$900,000,000.00Hardcover$12.355.The Doctrines and Discpline by SOUTHE METHODIST PUBLISHING HOUSE (1886)Formats Buy new New from Used fromUnknown Binding$99,000,000.00I just hope they don't already have a copy.

5,Excellent Max and Ruby DVD,This Max and Ruby DVD is one of the best of their series. My children love this video and ask to watch it over and over. Max's mischief in this video is more on the fun/cute side.I highly recommend!
2,Low Budget History,"DVD came in an envelope with no case - only a paper sleeve. Can't expect much more for $2.95. No narration - no sound, no captions. Some good footage though. If you were to view this DVD not knowing there was an earthquake and fire in San Francisco in 1906, you'd have thought it was bombed. Shows well the destruction and devastation. This DVD would be a good candidate for a knowledgeable narration and better editing."
2,"cute story, but be forewarned...","cute story, but be forewarned. if you don't mind hearing the F word about 30+ times in a movie - than this movie is for you. it's a great story and i love the actors in it - but...a bit much - serious - it was a LOT. i wish someone would have warned me...so - there you go!"
3,"Selma can act, but didn't need to go this far","We don't often get to see Selma Blair play good roles - she took front and center in this film and did a wonderful job of acting. I love her work, but not enough films with her playing good roles - the movie didn't do her any justice by having her play a role with another woman. The movie overall has a great cast. If you have kids, I'd suggest not allowing them to see this. Also, check out the music in the film - I always wait until the end and jot them all down... and usually the soundtracks are missing the good songs - so it's off to iTunes or amazon.com to download. If you are a Selma Blair fan - or a fan of any of these actors/actresses - check out the film. Hope to see Selma in more upcoming films where she can use her talent."
2,Depressing but watcheable,"If you like films in which some of the main characters seem depressed and on the edge of falling apart most of the time, you will probably like this movie. it's very watcheable and the characters are interesting in some ways, but for me, the whole thing lacked a bit of zip. It seems to dwell terribly heavily on things like the inability of people to forgive and move on, the inability of the writers to get back to what works for them, and the inability of people to be happy. Things sort of work out in the end, but it's a bit heavy and depressing getting there."
2,Not Even Fluff: Lint!,"I was rooting for this but I can't get behind it. The characters are just cardboard cutouts and their is no point to the story. I know it's a Hollywood tradition to depict New Yorkers as living charmed lives, but none of this rang true and it doesn't even qualify as charming. I think Ed Burns needs to come down out of his penthouse and remind himself how real people live and love."
2,"Film Tries Too Hard To Just Be Itself, And Is Somewhat Shallow","The acting was stellar, and the casting is what enticed me to buy it. The male actors are HOT, HOT, HOT mofo's! I think the film visually had an attraction for me also. BUT. I wanted more depth and meaning in the characters and story. The character dialogue was shallow, and the story just kinda moved along without really letting you in on any real revelation. This movie had potential though. I think that if the director had spent a longer time on the actors' expressions and improvised acting, perhaps he could have done something different with the film. To tell you the truth, the film felt kinda empty. And, well, I like feeling empty sometimes."
4,They forgot something...,"If you are a fan of the 'Edward Burns film', you will certainly enjoy 'Purple Voilets'. It reminds me of 'Sidewalks of New York' in that it presents the city and surrounding locations as characters in their own right. As a faithful viewer of all his films, the only disappointment was with the DVD itself. My favorite part has always been listening to the director's commentary and finding out quirky specifics like why certain locations were used, or how difficult shots were planned and filmed, or even how the guys playing the bartender is related to the production assistant. Most people don't bother listening to these tracks but I think those of us who purchase an Edward Burns film look forward to it. Maybe next time..."
5,Genuine,"Intelligent, inspirational, well thought movie about real emotions. If you've ever believed in love, and how time subdues emotions but never severing the suppressed feelings of a long lost love.A fortuitious encounter at a restaurant sparks emotions, and rekindles the past. It's about second chances, and how people change; letting go of bitterness and believing in something or someone.As in any relationship, knowing who you are and what's important; taking time heal and getting to know yourself. Believing in yourself and your abilities, taking chances; those who risk win."
4,Burns rises from the ashes......,"Ed Burns clearly bottomed out with Ash Wednesday and started to get back on track with ""The Groomsmen"". He clearly matured as a writer, and this growth is obvious in this movie.I guess to sum it up, it just seems Burns is finally writing about more authentic characters, with more realistic makeups, flaws and character nuances than the caricatures he used to create for his movies.A nice story about 2nd chances, a good cast, great locations. Give it a shot."
4,a great movie,"I really enjoyed this flick, it's gotta a great story. I highly recommend it if you want a change of pace to the big budget movies out there."
4,"good overview of pi, but a bit thick on formalism at times","This is a very good overview of pi-calculus, It starts off well with a review of automata theory and then extends it to communication and concurrency. It focuses more on the principles than on practical aspects of using it for real systems. It uses good examples throughout, and with the formalistic presentation it requires careful attention of the reader. It is hard read at times but worth it. However, it is not for a casual reader, but for the really motivated."
4,More educational than the old version.,"I was a little annoyed when I learned about the ""Jay Jay's Mysteries"" changes to the new episodes. And I really freaked out when we didn't hear the familiar theme song. BUT give these a chance. They focus on teaching concepts like shapes, sizes and the five senses. (And Brenda blue gets an actual tool belt, which makes a heck of a lot more sense than the red belt she used to wear with her coveralls.) In addition to these new mysteries, this DVD features some ""old school"" -- style episodes, complete with the old theme song. So this is a good mix of the old and new.

3,jewel case broken,"CD is great, Music awesome (but I already knew that)the seller stated it was ""used Good"", however the jewel case hinges were broken and the CD could not even stay in the jewel case anymore. The seller should have labeled this ""used acceptable"""
5,alkaline trio rox,Alkaline Trio is going big and doing great. This CD is great like ALL of the other CDs. I have to reccomend this and every single CD that they put out. So buy this
1,The worst New Adventure novel ever.,"After I read the book I couldn't help but feel cheated of something. This book encapsulated none of the Bernice spirit I loved reading in the other books. I admit the book was mostly seen from another character's view and not Benny's but the point is I could not get involved with any of the characters. The writing was making it really hard. It just irritated me to no end. The sentences were so convoluted I had to read them several times just to make some sense out of it. It wasn't funny, it wasn't dramatic, it wasn't anything. I really wish I never bought or read this piece of awful disappointment."
1,Horrible,"I wish Dave Stone would get out of the Bernice Summerfield universe. All of his books (with the possible exception of Ship of Fools) are totally not funny or worthy of being read. I wish he would let some other authors keep up with Bernice, and he can go back to Judge Dredd or something else."
5,Powerful Reading,"This book is outstanding!! I had trouble putting it down. It's written in a plain and simple style and it is fantastic. It's a short book, so if you've got a short span of time (or attention), then this book is for you! I really enjoyed it and it makes a great complement to any gift."
5,Save the elephant from poachers,Should be a must read for all wishing to save these beautiful animals from senseless poachers and to take action against poaching.
1,Listen to this CD and learn.,"Listen to Op. 5. It makes no great impression. It is tonal. It could not and can not compete with the likes of Strauss, Mahler, and company. Listen to Pierrot. It makes an impression. A foul smelling one, the way a silent fart in an elevator overcomes the senses of trapped elevator passengers. Only the farts Schoenberg indicates and which Craft and Co. emit on Pierrot are noisy AND deadly. Indeed, this piece always makes me feel ""sick"" when I hear it."
4,I love it!,"The moves are easy to do and Denise is very helpful in her explanations of each sequence. There are four distinct segments (Sun Salutations, Standing Poses, Floor Work and Relaxation), so you can pick and choose if you're pressed for time. The outdoor background scenery is magnificent!"
3,Cheezy!,"The first portion of this video is good if you're looking for an areobic workout. Ms. Austin seems to miss the ""yoga"" part of her yoga video, though overall it's a good workout & helpful for flexability."
4,Barska 5megapixel binoculars,"Good quality for the price. Haven't downloaded pictures yet but from what I see on the screen, they look good. Zoom is not what I expected but that doesn't mean it's bad."
1,2 that would not work!!!,I received the first one and it had batteries already installled and corroded. I received the second one and it would not come on due to the battery terminals were under the housing which occured during assembly. Amazon stated that they had several returns of this item and no more were available!
1,Huge disappointment,"We bought this item for travel. We tried it before we left and the pictures are very low-quality, it works 'ok' during the day, can't see a thing at night. We ended up leaving it at home, haven't used it in 6 months!"
1,Not A Good Buy,Not a good product. I had to return the one I purchased. Barska has acknowledged they have a problem with this model using up batteries. I went through 10 batteries in 4 days. It also would not stay turnrd on. Not a good idea to buy this one !
4,Binocular camera,"Very good product. Takes great pictures of distant objects. Great for supports,birdwatching and travel. Buy rechargeable batteries."
1,Barska burns batteries,"Received the Point 'N View very quickly. Began using it right away, but had to change batteries within a few days.Same thing happened with the second set of batteries, only lasted a few days. Overall the camera quality was ok, not a crisp picture, but not too bad for most uses. I returned the product. I'll check once in a while to see if Barska comes up with a better quality binocular/camera."
3,OK series,"I liked the idea but the story is silly. The president of the US seems to be the main investigater, all on his own without any advisors. The dialog is just as silly. Good idea for a series, but badly done."
2,Face Off Episode,"This episode is incredibly ludicrous. The showdown features 1 Apache helicopter that takes about ten minutes to destroy two out of three bus's , get real... There would have been half a dozen Apache's, and the game would have been over in seconds.... I can't believe anyone writing this would seriously believe that's the way it works, lol!!!!! If you are going to use the military as part of your show, you need to hire a military adviser. This is a cartoon. The only reason I gave it three stars is because the acting was, for the most part good, effects not too bad, and the storyline could have been great, but really fell short."
2,No rhyme or reason,"There is no straight line,to this story.Too many back and forths,to keep any continuity.I think the star actors should be more noteable;with more dialog."
4,I've Watched Two Episodes & I Like It,"I hope this series doesn't go nuts with government conspiracies. That possibility is certainly there. The premise though, of aliens, who look very much like us but have some significant differences, is more interesting that I thought it would be. This is because there are so many alien-ufo shows and most of them get tedious covering the same old ground. This has some very exciting adventure sequences with the very best being a plane crash that is swapped out from the Miami area to the southwest desert. There is also an alien deep inside the CIA. I recommend you give this one a try. It is ambiguous about whether they mean us ill or not. It may well remain ambiguous, which may remain truer to how it might actually come about if such a thing were possible."
1,This is one lousy show,Come on NBC spend a few bucks and hire some writers who can write and some actors who can act. This show is nothing but a recycled old idea that has been dumbed down to appeal to an audience of ten year olds. Thank god for HBO and Showtime.
1,Boring...,"The previews/lead up to ""The Event"" were interesting and I was looking forward to a riveting, well thought out and well acted new series. Not so. This series is boring, the dialog is boring and the acting is double boring. The writers are trying to create an edge of your seat build up moment, but it falls completely flat and left me with not even a warmed over feeling.So not worth it. I will be very surprised if this lasts for more than 1 season. Flash Forward was way better and wasn't on for more than a season."
2,"First episode piqued my interest, but...","I forgot to record the second and recorded the next 8, waiting for the 2nd episode to reappear. Don't know if it ever did, but I never found it. And, now they want me to pay to see it. I watched 10 minutes of the third episode and was completely lost. I have subsequently deleted the episodes I had recorded and canceled the season pass. I may have enjoyed the show, but now I will never know."
3,Solid series but will never get finished,"This is a reasonably well made series with some familiar faces. Keep in mind as you start this series that it was not picked up for a second season and the story never resolves. The ride up until the final cliffhanger is fun if a bit heavy handed. They tried a flashback narrative that confused people first go round and may have contributed to the early death of the show, nevertheless it is worth the watch.As far as the actors, Taylor Cole is a genuine find in the series and she plays a convincing killer and is never over the top. Tony nominee, Zeljko Ivanek is a standout and I keep seeing nothing but brilliant performances from him. He should win an Emmy or an Oscar for something, he is that good, and is working on a lot of A list projects both tv and film. Not a fan of the star Jason Ritter who seems a bit lost all of the time."
4,Great show!!,It was a great show but maybe to complicated for some of the mindless herd who prefer dumb shows like jersey shore. I hope they do come out with a follow up movie as is rumored to possibly happen.
2,In the running for worst show,"So many repeated flashbacks. I don't know what they were trying to accomplish. They had 20 minutes of story and stretched it into 45. Dialog is lame.Maybe they are trying to create a new ""Lost"", this time though, the viewers are stranded on a remote island."
5,Way Too Awesome,"Out of all of the Goosebumps books I read Werewolf Skin has got to be one of the best. It is different from werewolf stories I've heard. It is scary, and pretty gory. But it is very good. My favorite part is when Alex goes into the woods and hears and sees scary things, and then the next morning, everyone starts talking about werewolves. It does have an unexpected ending. I thought it was going to be about a kid who goes to his aunt and uncle's house and hears howling and gets suspicious. But it is way better than that."
5,Real Scary,This is a fun book but real scary. You want to put it down to not read the bad stuff but you just can't.... you must find out what happens next. If you haven't read it... you must.
2,"A little shaggy dog, er, wolf story","For the most part, the book follows true to the televion episode. However, there's a twist to the ending. What is, you say? I'm not giving it away..."
3,Revew,"The book took a long time to arrive but once it did, it was in good condition, with minimal damage (this was a used copy). The story was okay but not one of my son's favorite Goosebumps books."
5,Love it,"This Stapler is great, it's easy to use it doesn't jam, can staple a large amount of paper at a time as well as can staple two sheets all with the same ease. Just order myself another one."
3,Just some missing information,"A quartet of streetwise teenage runaways fights for survival on the streets of Hong Kong, mostly by stealing and hustling. Their plight is complicated by the presence of a serial killer with a taste for runaway girls."
1,Same Phone also listed for $150 on Amazon,"First, I have this phone and it is nice if a bit clunky.Second THIS LISTING IS FOR $500 and there is a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT LISTING FOR $150.Please, please, do a search on VOQ Professional and buy the other one if you are interested. The only difference is the PRICE."
5,great for hanging a porch swing,"The hanger is very heavy,sturdy and gives me complete confidence that itwon't break! I am using two of these to hang my porchswing from."
5,These babies are solid!,"These are probably overkill for the swing glider I got them to go with, but they matched the ones that came on our wooden swing set. :) This set of two came with a couple of carabiners; I wasn't sure if it would or not.We weren't able to use this with our swing right away, cause we didn't have a long drill bit to connect this to our wooden swing set. Just so you know you might need one."
5,Use these if your kids are portly...,"What you get when you buy these swing hangers are two very heavy duty connectors for your swinging pleasure. You also get the hardware that you need to mount it and to connect one side of your swing chain. The hardware included is 5/16 but I used 3/8 hardened socket head screws to connect them as I am paranoid about safety. The mounting holes are plenty big enough. I used them for regular swings but I think they are designed for hanging a porch swing. They make for a fast, smooth swing. Go big or go home I always say."
3,Good start for a marvelous trilogy. Rate:***1/2,"The Physiognomy is Ford's second novel and the first installment of a loosely connected trilogy that narrates the trajectory of Cley, Physiognomist master class, and the fall of the Well-Built-City, the brainchild of it's ruler Drachton Below.Although Ford's creation is as inventive and multilayered as his subsequent books, I must say that TP has serious problems of plot and character development.The plot development is uneven and the characters, with the exception of Cley, are a bit shallow. Another major flaw is the awkward and unconvincing manner with wich Ford handles the spiritual metamorphosis of Cley.Despite these major flaws TP is a book worth reading and Cley is a fascinating character.Don't missed it."
4,"Add some heart, and it would be perfect.","The world that Ford creates in The Physiognomy is compelling, detail-rich, and difficult to forget. I think even the most suspicious readers will be charmed by his depiction of the Well-Built City and the details like the miners who have inhaled so much dust that they turn to stone.Unfortunately, his grip on characters is not quite as good. While Cley is engaging on a certain level, as a reader I was ultimately unable to care about either his goodness or his badness. If Ford could have made him matter just a little bit more, then it would not have felt so empty at the end.Despite the flaws, one of the most original fantasy reads I have had in a long time. Worth reading for that reason alone."
1,Avoid,I've read better stories on the wall of a truck stop men's room. I was compelled to finish this steaming pile because it was short and I desperately hoped the ending would hang all the disjointed flimflam together into some sort of unified whole. Instead all I got was a dissatisfying conclusion to a couple situations I cared nothing about and a short screed about science and technology being the root of all evil. Really the only thing that was positive about this book was that it was extremely short.
3,I Still Don't Know My Reaction,"I admit it. I read this book,and soared through the pages. The prose was engaging- I created a flow and you were dragged through this novel. But after the book was finished and placed beside my bed- I wondered about what I had just read. It was quite descriptive/cryptic, and actaully quite sick and perverse. It was the battle between good and evil- but not really. More between bad and wicked. There wasn't really one character I could indentify with, or even root for. In the sequel it gets even worse as the most sympathetic character is an educated a demon- and we are forced to feel bad for his civility. I still don't know if I liked the book- the style was fine, but as a whole it left a deep chill in my bones."
4,GOOD,This is a nice tea for those of us who don't use sweeteners. I wish it had more apple flavor. The cinnamon is the predominate flavor.
2,Overpowering Cinnamon,"At first sip, this tea was pleasantly sweet and abruptly becomes overwhelming with the sharp, dry taste of cinnamon. Holding the tea in your mouth for a few seconds and allowing the aromas to circulate through the mouth reduced the nasty aftertaste. Watering it down a bit and adding a few drops of honey reduced the potency, as well. The sharpness of the cinnamon is too much for this tea to really be enjoyed and the remaining sachets will likely be used to spice a few gallons of apple cider."
3,Overwhelmed by cinnamon taste,I love the strong scent of this tea and it tingles my throat after I have myself a sip. It could've have been better if this tea had more sweetness of an apple because it is rather bitter. I'm not too sure if I would buy this flavour of celestial tea but I certainly enjoyed other ones.
1,Too much cinnamon!,I will not be finishing this box of tea. It had way too much cinnamon in it. I did not enjoy it at all.
4,Strong cinnamon,"You dont get the apple flavor like other brands but I'll start using this to make cinnamon apple oatmeal and it'll all be good. The cinnamon is too overwhelming for regular tea, unless you make it really watered down. Other brands make better cinnamon apple."
3,To Much Cinnamon,This is a good cold weather tea - BUT very strong on the cinnamon side of the equation... I was expecting more apple flavor. Most likely won't buy again but then I still have plenty left... will last a long time I'm guessing.
1,Not so tasty...,"I got this tea thinking it would be a nice tea reminiscent of the kind of hot cider drink you might get from a coffee shop. What I got was a rather unpleasant experience. When I first opened the box at work, my co-workers said this tea smelled like the cinnamon chewing gum ""Big Red"". When I got to the first sip I encountered the sweet flavor of the apples before I was quickly overwhelmed by the very bitter taste of cinnamon. It felt like two siblings who were not on good terms with each other. Face-scrunching ensued. I will not be finishing this box."
1,Strange phony apple taste,"I bought this in the hopes of finding a replacement tea for my favorite Gingerbread Spice tea. This was a huge disappointment.It tastes and smells really strange. For lack of a better description, it tastes like phony chemical apples. Yuck!"
1,Someone forgot to proof read,"Thankfully I got this strategy guide from the library, or I would have wasted good money. While the walkthrough is decent the quests are not well organized. A lot of the game is real time dependent and no warning is give. For one quest you need an item that take fifteen real hours to develop yet the book gives you no warning. The worst part is the short cut description of enemy weaknesses. A warning that an enemy is -50% towards light will either mean it is 50% weak toward that element or that elament is only worth fifty percent damage on that enemy. The text description of strengths and weaknesses is much more accurate, but by no means perfect. For one boss one area said it was 100% weak towards dark while just below it said 100% weak towards light. That information is kind of important. Do not waste your money on this book unless your obsessive about miscellanious quests."
3,THE FINAL CURTAIN,"SHAME ON NBC. The series' final season does not wrap up all the plotlines, leaving viewers in the air (although the two subsequent movies evidently accomplish this). At any rate, the show was losing its vitality and excitement in this overly contrived season. Jarod continues to seek out wrongs, and try to right them by staging similar fates for the bad guys. The show has too many bad guys and they only manage to get rid of two of them before the season ended. If you enjoyed the first three seasons, youll probably want to watch just to see how many more times Parker lets Jarod pull the wool over her eyes. A disappointing wrapup for a sometimes great show."
5,the pretender - season 4,"Very good, very fast. I like it so much and I'm much interested in having more information about the pretender."
4,"Enjoyable season, sad it ended without resolution",Things really start to get a shake up but unfortunately there's too many secrets left hanging and no resolution. Enjoyable series that kept my attention.
5,Old Chestnut,"Some people don't like this show, and most of those people dislike it for the same reasons.... whatever those reasons may be. When someone who doesn't like this show is given the opportunity to make their sentiments known (especially to a Pretender fan), it is quickly seized, throttled and polished off. The unsavory side of humanity is revealed during these times, but we endure, as Pretender people must! Stay steady in the face of ridicule meant to weaken the show you love!Allow me to offer my opinion on this item, as this step is titled, on The Pretender season 4. This has been my all-time favorite thing to watch, by far, and has been for many years. If you believe that a character does not need to have a last name for you to be entertained, there is a chance you might enjoy The Pretender."
4,Not like the rest of the season sets.,"I came in a semi-translucent dvd case, not a cardboard marquee like seasons 1-3.Otehr than that, no complaints other than the double-sided discs"
3,freeze up,This is the fifth Pretender dvd order I have made. All of them have froze up and skipped at least two or three places
5,"The Pretender, Season 4","Love this series. Innovative, interesting and well produced. Cheering for Jared to be victorious in finding family and answers. Over the previous seasons Jared has grown in experience without losing the wonder of life. Something that I find encouraging for my life. Although this story is fiction it gives a positive message that no matter how hard you have it, you can rise above your circumstances and change the world, even if it is the world of just one other person."
4,Good quality,"Good quality seat. Fit perfect on my daughter's 20"" bike by putting the front seat post clamp to the rear of the bottom seat pivot. Sparkly red, just what my daughter wanted. It looks well made enough that it should last as I keep moving it onto larger bikes as my daughter grows. This is a well made product with decent padding. I have seen other banana seats that have very poor padding.Edit, three weeks after purchase: Some of the silver strips are pulling off. My 7-year-old daughter doesn't care at all, but you might. Other than the strips pulling off, the seat still appears like it will last a long time. This is still a more comfortable, better made seat than the others I looked at at bike shops in my area."
2,French Clarinet Art,"Some musical interpretations are questionable; others are delightful. Upper register very strident. I found the fast tonguing on the SECOND movement of the Saint-Saens Sonata to be very impressive and not musically objectionable. The altissimo is definitely in-your-face, though; a no-no in my tonal concept."
3,Not really for guitarists,"This is not a tabulature book. You'll get musical notes and instructions for chords, but when it gets down to the likely reason you purchased the book, to play David Gilmour's awesome solos, this book will not help you. There will not even be musical sight reading for guitar solos, just a chords pattern and a note telling you to ""improvise guitar solo."" It does however go well for pianists/keyboards because that aspect seems pretty fleshed out, and I like the print/layout design. I just wished there was a warning ahead of time for purchasing that I would not get to learn out to play those gorgeous guitar leads ""Sorrow"", ""On The Turning Away"" or ""Yet Another Movie."" For future buyers, this is your warning: this is not a TAB book."
2,OK book but some reviews seem fishy!,"The book is alright. Nothing new or original. I bought it, read it 3 times and returned it unsatisfied. There are better books.Check out the 2 reviews by the guys from VEGAS below me. Don't those reviews seem a bit too polished? I am betting they are either friends of the author or it is the author himself.Pass this one up. Frank Scoblete offers much better content, even though some of his books are amateur as far as graphics go."
2,Hated it!,I was really disappointed with this book. I loved the previous one from Alexandra but found this one to be too dry! I should have skipped the first half of the book. I was looking for romance and didn't find it until the story was half over.
2,From Back Cover,"MARRIED TO THE ENEMYShe'd awakened in a hospital, confused, to discover she was mother to a newborn... and wife to a steely-eyed stranger. Mere hours after gazing on Ishaq Ahmadi in London, Anna found herself attheir desert home, which seemed both hauntingly familiar and oddly foreign.No evidence of a happy marriage existed in the palatial residence. No photographs. No clothes that fit Anna's slender build. No trust, given Ishaq's endless questions. There was simply the primal, passionate connection between them... and, of course, the baby.But Anna soon learned that nothing about her marriage was to be believed...[6th in the Sons of the Desert series]"
1,waste of time,"Most of this book is reasonable but the chook dome design is a joke ,it is a flimsy piece of garbage designed buy a person who should stick to gardening not designing not to mention you have to figure out for yourself and fix the many flaws,if you are in a high wind area dont waste you time or energy or money.!"
4,Fine if you deciding which Career Interest Test to Choose,This book offers a great way to interpret how to choose the right interest test if you are a career professional already. I would avoid it if you are not a professional in this field.
5,There are no better recordings than this one,"Even if this CD does have bad sound quality, the orchestra does bring out the ultimacy that other conductors seem to lack. The audience here expected the most exciting Mahler Symphony no. 3 performance from everybody who was involved and they got it. I think this recording is even more exciting than Pierre Boulez, Leonard Bernstein, Lorin Maazel, or Maurice Abravanel. Leonard Bernstein's Mahler recording is not what I thought it would be, Abravanel is totally weak, Lorin Maazel is way too slow, Michael Tilson Thomas is too not-Mahler-like, and Pierre Boulez is self-involved but this recording sounds the most similar to the way Mahler himself might've conducted it. A highly reccommended recording."
2,Rerecordings of the Original Hits,"These versions aren't awful, but they are not the original recordings most buyers would be familiar with from listening to the radio over the years. So if you are looking for the original hits, go elsewhere."
5,Amazing,"Bart is just an amazing writer. If you don't normally read poetry, you will still like this. He's irreverant and hilarious. I was lucky enough to see him read his poetry as well. He is just amazing. Buy this book."
2,Farewell to this book,There were only a couple of poems in this book that I enjoyed. I would like more poems about whiskey and starlight. The best poem was the one that they read on NPR.
3,Had to switch away from this program,"We have a computer, which is soon to be replaced, which had the minimum RAM for surfing the web on it. We found that Norton hangs up on the computer and never finishes its job. We switched to AVG and the problem was solved."
3,works,works okay a little bigger then my OEM one but was able to make it work. Had to trim the top a bit and the bottom side just so it would fit in my M4400.
3,Tiny Bar,"This soap is about the size of the soap you get at a hotel. Although the scent is lovely, the price is outrageous. I can't blame anyone but myself because I failed to look at the shipping cost. $7.99?! To ship a tiny bar of soap in a cardboard box?! But again, that's my fault for buying it and not being more aware of the price. I do want to mention that they did send me a companion bar of soap (of the same size)free, so that was nice. Anyway, I have nothing against the soap. Just be aware shoppers of the shipping price and size/amt you're getting before you buy."
5,KENNY DOES IT AGAIN!,"WE LOVED THIS CD. THIS IS ONE WE LOVE FOR COLD WINTER NIGHTS IN FRONT OF THE FIRE. VERY SMOOTH AND GREAT TO LISTEN TO WTIH THAT SPECIAL SOMEONE. HAS KENNY IN ALL HIS GLORY, PLUS SOME DUETS WITH KENNY: THE BEE GEES CALLED ""EYES THAT SEE IN THE DARK."" ALSO THE CLASSIC ""ISLANDS IN THE STREAM"" W/ DOLLY PARTON. AND, ONE WITH JAMES INGRAHAM AND KIM CARNES CALLED ""WHAT ABOUT ME."" THIS CD WILL BRING BACK GREAT MEMORIES!"
5,Great compilation-cd!!,I have just one word for this CD...GREAT one!!...As always...Kenny is a great singer and performance-artist!!..so thankyou;o)Kenny!...cheerz from Bina;o)
4,"Better than a Parenting Book, This is a Game is a Winner!","Even the smartest, most loving mothers can lose it over behavior battles with their kids...whether it's tantrums, never picking things up or always whining for more. The BITs Kit takes some preparation to start, but it's a game that really works to cure a bad habit. It's actually fun, especially coming up with the rewards in the gift bag and being able to come through for your child as ""the good guy"" in helping them. The Bits playing pieces are collectible and become a badge of honor. Finally - a behavior remedy you can use in public or a tense situation that also makes lasting change appealing!"
3,okay if you need to review,"This is the First A&P book I have tried to read, and it was recommended by one of my instructors as a good book to learn the material. I think this book is good for review, or as a guide to the material I should learn, but not a good learning tool for fist timers. I have found myself reading very dense paragraphs of information, and then looking up the terms on line to learn them and understand the concepts. In short good review, but not good if this is all you have to learn from."
4,Medic students who use this to supplement their knowledge,"I found this book to be very easy to understand. I used this to supplement my Brady Paramedic text book.. I think that this book is clearer and in most cases just as informative as my Brady Text. For that reason, and the fact that this book is well organized, I would recommend it."
3,right color,"These folders were the color I was needing but I ordered the 3-hole punch folders and received plain no 3-hole punch, so I had to punch folders myself and put in my own fastners - I did not have time to send back and see if I would get correct ones I ordered - but as I said the color was exactly what we needed and the overall durability was good"
1,One Should not Read This Book,"I have made a mistake by buying this book, which is just a total failure.The authors made swift surveys of many different aspects of pre-history of India without trying to analyse the context.Their view is that everything that is great and good in India, including the Sanskrit language, all came from outside. Indians made no inventions, nothing at all.This is a pathetic book, written by some really Racist British authors, who know possibly nothing about the ancient Indian literature and the description of the ancient India given in those literature.The author with Catholic spirit accepted the False Theory of Aryan Invasion.These people are not intellectual, just pretenders."
1,very dissapointed,Bought this as Christmas present for my sister but will have to find something else.Definately does not make you want to spend Christmas in the mountains
2,Don't pay more than $5 for it,"Pros:-The concept of an LCD shade is a great idea.-This product does help a bit when shooting in bright sunlight.Cons:-It's so flimsy that I doubt it will last longer than a few weeks. So at $15, it's ridiculously overpriced.-The supposedly ""clear"" plastic LCD cover that came with mine isn't very clear, and it scratched easily when I tried to clean it.Conclusion:You might want to give it a try if you can get one for $5 or less. If not, I'd wait for one of the higher-quality versions that are sure to come on the market eventually."
1,This did not even last a week. My original one lasted five years. I am really disappointed.,Originally owned this product for five years. This one broke in less than a week. Definitely would not recommend it.
4,A must for any subcompact,The pop up shade is a necessity. This is the second I have purchased for my camera and it has saved my camera many times and has improved my shots too. A must have for any small digital camera.
2,Almost better than nothing,"I have a GE A830 digital camera. It has a 2.5 inch LCD as a viewfinder. In any kind of light, the display provides only reflection of the camera operator. Delkin's website sells this viewfinder shade for considerably more than Amazon, so I bought it at Amazon. The shade slightly reduces glare and reflection, but not enough to be worth the cost (little as it is). I consider this item to be more or less a waste of money."
1,This shade was worthless for me.,"I have always had a problem using the digital screen on my Canon Powershot A540, except indoors. So I was excited to find out about this product. Unfortunately, it actually makes the situation worse. It includes a clear plastic window that covers the screen on the camera. This turns the digital screen into a mirror, so that when I look into the camera to take a picture I see myself. Worse than useless."
5,Best product for protecting the screen,"I love this product, not necessarily for taking photos on a sunny day, but it protects the screen on my digital point and shoot camera. It is protected from breaking and from ugly fingerprints or dirt. My first was broken by two people who dropped my camera and I was unable to find the product at a camera store so I purchased it online. I'm am constantly getting comments from people who think it is an item that came with the camera so I am constantly explaining to people that that can and should purchase it for their cameras. I have no idea if anyone has ever followed up with my suggestion."
4,Excellent Product,"I was suspicious about sticking the pop-up shade on my camera, but it isn't bulky at all and pops up quickly when needed. It definitely solves the sun glare problem when taking photos in bright sunlight."
5,Outstanding,"The Nikon S10 is my first digital that does not have a view finder. I ordered the shade right after getting the camera. I tried shooting pics at an air show, impossible. Since getting the shade all is much better.As a bonus, the shade protects the screen. Get one, you will NOT regret it."
3,Could be great,"The video of this is very good. I gave it a three because it is very hard to read the sub-titles. They are in white with a very light background. It makes it very difficult to read, and follow the stories. It the sub-titles weren't a problem I would have given it a five."
3,Subtitles are a disaster,"Looked forward to watching this as the Way of St. James fascinates me. Some inspirational moments but the downside is the subtitles. What idiot puts white subtitles on a white background? Impossible to read and that always drives me crazy. So many people speaking in Spanish throughout with subtitles and if one cannot read what is being said, well it is a washout. Scenery is gorgeous and the people seem to be spiritually changed by the trip. Whoever put in the subtitles ruined this altogether."
3,OK but not great,"This was good. It has a lot of interviews in other languages. I mean a whole lot of the DVD is composed of interviews. And the English subtitles are sometimes difficult to read. But is is very informative. I think the film ""The Way"" starring Martin Sheen is much better though."
5,Great book,It's a great book to read even if you are a non believer. It has good things to learn from. Everyone should develop a positive way of thinking because it benefits everyone. I recommend this book to everyone.
2,disappointing,"I was disappointed by this book, I was mistaken because on the amazon site is written 2003 but in the book is written (c) 1989. As I already bought the book affirmations your passport to happiness many years ago I thought this is a newer book but it is mostly the same content as written in affirmations your passport to happiness."
3,Praising young folks,I am delighted to have bought this cd as a salute to the young people that performed on it
5,Awsome!,This is a must buy! I own this CD and I have the game.It is really good trust me! It really goes to show how good people can make music sound.
3,"Good, but not as good as the first","This is coming from a Sonic fan who hasn't actually played Sonic Adventure 2.Unlike the music from its predecessor Sonic Adventure, this music is much more straightforward. A large portion of it consists of garage-style punk, another large portion is techno and DJ-ing, and there are bits and pieces of latin thrown in. The instrumentation is not nearly as complex as in the first SA, with the exception of the interplay between the synthesized instruments and KMFDM-style vocals in ""Throw It All Away,"" which is phenomenal. Also, Knuckles' theme song successfully blends a rap feel with wind instruments and singing, and thuggishly written, yet touching lyrics.And sadly, these vocals were the only good ones on the album. Most of the non-processed vocals would have sounded better had the singers been more confident; the vocals too often sound suppressed and choked.I would only recommend this album to serious Sonic fans."
4,thats wut i call music,i liked the cd.i only didnt like eggman`s songs or shadows theme.i really liked knuckles`s songs.even thogh hes my least fav character.sonic is ok.tails is great.rouge sounds like britney spears wich makes the songs nice.the chao song was reallly cuuuuuute u should listen to it.
4,Sonic Fans Rejoice!,"Great mix of Jazz, Pop, Rap, and Rock. It features the themes of most of the characters, most of which are sung like the characters themselves. Unless you don't like music, you should enjoy this CD. I recommend this CD."
4,"Hunnid-P, Crush 40, and Tony Harnell STAR ARTISTS",Hunnid-P is one of the only people to rap on Sonic. I like the way he describes Knuckles stages. Crush 40 still rockin hard!Tony Harnell's songs are cool (We can is a'ite) be fore i go i gotta say one thing... Jun Senoue can sure play dat guitar keep at it!!
3,"Good, but nowhere as fantastic as Crush 40's debut","I must say, I love all the music from Sonic Adventure. ...The vocals, at least. Because they're by one of my favorite groups: Crush 40. Go get that CD before you even THINK about putting your hands on this. But if you can't find it anywhere, this is solid. My favorite tracks are:Live And LearnIt Doesn't MatterEscape From The CityUnknown From M.E (best non-Crush 40 song on the CD)Wild CanyonThis CD is recommended to anybody who loves Crush 40/rock/progressive rock/rap/nu-rapGood CD, but get Crush 40's CD first."
1,Far from magical. Boring indeed.,"It's like one of those bad servings of ""Chicken soup for the soul"". The writing is dull. The stories are boring. The phrases which tied up each story are not remarkable, and definitely not magical. Forgive my harsh criticism. Take it as my sincere effort to have your money and time saved."
5,gem!!,If you are a savatage fan this is a must own!! Jon Olivia voice sounds like a metal god from hall of the mountain king!!Hes really into this not like the last few lame releases from savatage.The next time you hear jons voice with this much energy is when his 1st solo cd gets released! This really jams!!
3,"Yes, but...","While I generally agree with the prior reviews in praise of Galbraith's performance, I don't think the obnoxious breathing is in Bach's score.Such distraction is self-indulgent and disruptive. He includes it in all his releases and I too hope for re-recordings upon his maturity."
5,Great Stuff....,"I inadvertently stumbled Across Greeley Estates on here when I searched for ""screamo"" bands I have to tell you when I seen the name I thought bah just another unknown bad screamo band however that could not be any further from the truth.I do like hawthorne heights and I love these guys all of there recordings are just awesome I would strongly recommend this and their other discs to everyone I think they should be more recognized.personal favs:1)Angela Lansbury Keeps Guys Like You Off The Street.2) Life Is A Garden3)Y'all With The Vampire Squad?"
4,A must for your cd collection.,"If you like todays rock at all, this cd has something for everyone: screams, melodies, beautiful lyrics, ballads, flat out rocking. Also get Outside of This and Caveat Emptor, two other great cds from Greeley Estates.Check these guys out live if you ever see they are near your town. You will not be disappointed. One of the most down to earth bands in this industry."
5,K&N cold air intake.,"I bought this for my Scion xB (06) and it fit great, noticed a boost in HP right away. It was easy to install!"
5,Very Informative and A Must Read For Pregnancy,I read this when I was first expecting. This is an easy book to read and understand. It gave detailed information as to what to expect during labor and how to prepare myself emotionally and physically. Throughout my pregancy I constantly referred back to this book. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is expecting. This book helped to allievate my fears and was encouraging in the sense that my body was designed to give birth naturally without any interventions. Fantastic book!
3,useful but outdated,"I would love to see a newer version of this book. I wasn't aware when I purchased that this book was 20 years old. The yoga-inspired stretching, movement, and breathing are all relevant, but so much has changed medically in the last two decades, I didn't feel that I had purchased a book worth reading. If you're looking for good methods to manage birth pain, this book is a good starting point, but I would recommend purchasing other books also!"
2,move around and do what feels natural,"To be fair I didn't really read all that much of this book, but what I did read was basically the following: Move around a lot and do what feels natural to you. I didn't really need a whole book explaining ""how"" to do that so I stopped reading it. Save yourself the money and skip this book or consider getting Ina May's Guide to Childbirth instead."
2,MUCH REPETITION,GENERALLY GOOD IDEAS BUT MANY THINGS WERE REPEATED AND THIS MADE ME GET BORED BEFORE I FINISHED. I LIKE TO SEE DETAIL AND INFORMATION IN DEPTH.
2,Really not helpful like some other books,I found this book to be very basic and not generally helpful. Thanks
3,Not for the feint of heart,"This book is not for everyone. We were a bit surprised when we opened it that everyone in the photos was completely nude. Of course, it is probably the best way to give birth, but it was not what we were expecting. Otherwise the book was very good and gave great information for labor and delivery. We have told several friend who were expecting and wanted natural childbirth about it."
3,"Not a ""must have""","I am planning a natural childbirth and I found this one the least helpful. It is great for promotting squatting during bith and has good pictures that illustrate why squatting is the best position.However, beyond that I found that both theNatural Childbirth the Bradley Way: Revised EditionandThe Birth Partner, Second Editionwere much better for preparing my husband and I for the delivery."
3,Okay book,"There are a few typos in the book, but I noticed that a lot of eBooks have a bit of typos... In my opinion more than you'd have found in printed books.The info is generally good, if you are a 'beginner' or haven't ever read anything about active birth... Somethings seems repetitive, but I guess they really want to drive the point home...."
5,A must!!,"I think every woman who is pregnant, should read this book and study it. It has a wealth of information and truly makes you think about your upcoming birth!!"
5,Hands Down this is the book you want!,"I am a long time labor doula, childbirth educator, etc...and this is the singular book I recommend for moms to read if they want to know how to use their bodies to birth their babies or what to expect from Labor (and what expectant mama doesn't!).Even if you plan on pain meds read this book. You will experience labor, and the more of it that you work through before asking for meds, the healthier the outcome for you and baby. Labor pain is a message from your body telling you to move, and this book explains the physiology of birth so that you will understand the messages your baby is sending you as she moves through a variety of positions during the birthing process.Enjoy!"
5,Good for homestudy childbirth preparation,I am expecting my first child and unable to take prenatal yoga or a childbirth class. I wanted information on exercises that would prepare my body for natural childbirth and Active Birth provides the information I was seeking. Numerous exercises are included along with detailed instructions & photos.
4,Great reference,"I just finished reading this book in preparing for my non-medicated birth next month and I loved it. I gave it only 4 stars since I feel like I learned most of the positions in my prenatal yoga class and I wish there were some more, but I am so excited to take this to the hospital with me as a reference for my husband and I when we can't think of which positions to try after time.I feel like the combo of ""Natural Hospital Birth"" and ""Active Birth"" would be all that I needed to read. Also working on reading Ina May's book, as well as Birthing From Within, but i still think the other two would have been enough."
5,My personal favorite childbirth book!,"I bought about 9 pre-natal/pregnancy/childbirth books and this was by far my favorite. Although it didn't have much on nutrition and lacked going in to detail on several topics, it was the book I kept coming back to and used most overall. I am doing natural childbirth (no drugs, semi-home birth with mid-wives) and I found this book very complimentary to my preexisting beliefs and feelings about childbith. I took a childbirth class and I felt I got more out of this book than that class! I'm really into yoga and I appreciated the yoga and stretching positions shown in this book. I also loved the photos (even thought they looked like early 80's or late 70's) of the women doing the exercizes and giving birth, it was lovely and heart touching. My husband and I also practice (I'm still pregnant) the positions for lifting and supporting during labor, and the massage drawings were helpful."
2,Disappointing,"After reading the other reviews on this book, my expectations were very high. Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed, this book focused repeatedly on the fact that squatting is the best postion for giving birth and not much else. The yoga exercises were handy, but compared with the other reviews this book was given, I was expecting more substance."
3,508D Motion Sensor,The motion sensor is just ok. We have a pickup truck & when tested it chirps sometimes. It senses the motion kind of slow. But at least it does chirp. We live in NYC & sometimes it starts chirping when car passes by. It is an extra security for your car. I guess for this price it is worth having it.
5,Outstanding!!,This little clear box is an unbelievable add-on for a security system. You can change the field radar to surround your car. My garage door sets it off when it opens. It is a very touchy add-on that will help protect your car!!
3,Works but not as expected,"I'm not going to say that I'm unhappy with the product as it does work well. But I have it set at max and you still have to be about touching the car to make it go off. There is no reason for two fields as the total size of the outer most field is so small. The leds telling you which field is being tripped is great, I first thought that only the outer field was working turns out half the time the enter field was being tripped its that the first message was still being broadcasted. I was thinking that you would want the first field to trip a warning and the second to trip the alarm, this will not work, it would be tripping the full alarm all the time.I just have the warning on. One more thing, when you approach the car, some spots trip 4 feet away and some you have to put your face to the glass.."
5,nice addition easy add-on,I like this adjustable field sensor for an addition to a car alarm I was very easy to plug in during the install.
5,A bit bigger than the old Clifford sensor,"I still does the job well though. As for the power connectivity, I've already done the homework for you and it is safe to connect this unit directly to your Viper alarm system. The Viper manuals claim that they can't provide the current this sensor requires but in reality, it only draws 12mA on a full load. Even your typical 5mm blue LED draws more power than that!!The only recommendation I would make is to ensure your Viper alarm has a ground when armed feed for the sensor at its sensor connector. If it's anything like my Viper 5904 alarm, it will supply constant power and ground. For that, I ended up risking the warranty on my unit and modified it to supply ground when armed, keeping the installation neat and avoiding the microwave transmission when it wasn't required. The less RF noise in your vehicle while in use, the better!"
2,Too sensitive,Need lots of patience to properly adjust the zones...Works better if placed in a central location of the vehicle
3,Help prevent scratchers,"This device is helpfull to prevent any one from standing too close to vehicle and by extension leaning on it risking scratching. A must have for new vehicles, especially if the colour is black. However, due to the recommendations by manufacturer for device to be installed more to the center of vehicle, the field sensitivity to the front and rear of vehicle should be in ratio to the sensitivity as the sides of the vehicle. The price could be more competitive."
3,If You Walked in My Shoes: A PeoplewholoveGoodBooks Review,"This is the riveting story of how keeping secrets can come back to haunt you. Coreen Holmes Treadwell for all appearances has a successful career, loving marriage and a wonderful relationship with her stepchildren. But her life hasn't always been so ""perfect"", as a young girl she was raped and wound up pregnant. Coreen is hiding a painful secret. A secret named Frieda Davis. Frieda Davis is the daughter that Coreen never knew. As a child, Frieda suffered years of abuse from her stepfather, which has made her bitter and determined to find her birth mother, to make her suffer as she has. She puts together a plan of vengeance that will ultimately change their lives forever. This book is one that stays with you long after you put it down. Gwynne Forster has written a story that will make you think and touch your heart. I give this book 3 stars!Reviewed by Shay CPeoplewholoveGoodBooks"
2,Disappointed.,I could not get through the first chapter before I stopped reading altogether. I have read and enjoyed many books by this author. This one was just more heavy than i need to escape through reading like I prefer.
2,"Very, Very, Unrealistic","In this story, Coreen's daughter seeks to get revenge from Coreen beause of the bad life her daughter had (she gave her daughter up for adoption).The story line and the actions of the characters and their thinking makes no sense at all. They are so unrealistic. It is a terrible book."
1,No table of contents or indexes,"Yes, the Bible is wonderful, what a blessing the Word of God is!But THIS version of the Bible is just simply the Bible: if ALL you want is to read the Bible in one year, it probably is OK. But even then, there is NO list of days and readings! I ordered this and had to return it.NOTA BENE: buyer beware & caveat emptor; there are NO notes, NO maps, NO footnotes, NO diagrams, NO comments of any sort, NO table of contents, NO index of any kind, NO concordance, NO glossary, NO pronunciation guide: NO NOTHING."
2,Blah,This is nothing more than a regular bible. I was hoping for some Catholic commentary or a suggested reading path other than going straight through the Bible in the order it is published in.
2,Died after a week,Worked for about a week. After that the fan comes on at about 50*F causing the fan to run almost all the time. No more Hypertech for me!
1,Defective Product,This model of Sylvania TV is defective and has blue lines running through the whole screen. I would not recommend anyone buy this product. the only bright spot was Skybox Usa's help in returning this product and making sure i was satisfied with the end results.
4,"6626LG 26"" LCD HDTV","I was lucky enough to be a Amazon winner and got this TV for $200, I'm using this TV in my kitchen and couldn't be happier with it. It took some tweaking to get the color and brightness right, but once we did the TV is great. Amazon's price for this TV is way lower than other retailers ( QVC is charging $799. and Amazon's price this week is $499. with free shipping. A great value! ) Also the remote is super easy to use, we also bought a 42in LCD and are still trying to figure out the buttons and features on that TV, this one came out of the box and was ready to go."
1,Can't Get it Fixed!!!,"This HD unit was okay until it just stopped working one day. $110 later at a very shady ""authorized"" electronics shop, I had it back, working fine...but less than THREE MONTHS LATER, the same thing happened, the shop would not stand behind the first repair and FUNAI wants me to send it to California to be fixed! It is sitting in the basement and I bought a Samsung, which works well! Stay away from Sylvania/Funai!"
3,doesn't last long,I bought it less than 2 years ago and loved the price and the TV. but about 4 months ago one of the sides of the TV started to get what looks to be a burn mark on the screen. it is like a black shadow that seems to slowly be taking over more and more of the set. I suspect that within the next year it will have to be replaced. It is a good TV but don't expect it to last more than a year or two.
5,Compared to my HDTV Projection TV,"I also was one of the fortunate ones to get this for $200 from Amazon. I had been looking at LCD's for a while to use in a bedroom. If hooking this up with analog cable or satellite the picture is good, but not great. However, I have a HD antenna in my attic that is also hooked up to my 61"" HD Sony Projection TV. I decided I wanted to compare the two, so I hooked them up side by side and the LCD picture blew me away at how much clearer it was compared to my projection. I used to think my picture was good, but I was really surprised at the quality of the LCD. This TV is perfect for a bedroom. However, I would suggest using an antenna to get local channels in HD. Overall, I believe this TV is an excellent purchase, especially for $200. :)"
4,"Good Value. Shipping is a little iffy, however.","I agreed with the reviewers that the t.v. is a great value, especially when you can get it for $500 or less. The price seems to move up and down alot, so you might want to watch it for awhile and see what happens. As for shipping, there is some risk involved, because Amazon ships these things in the same flimsy boxes in which they are stacked on the shelves. My UPS delivery was delayed by a few days, because my carrier was concerned that the set had been damaged. Thus far, it seems unhurt, but the box was open, and there was very little padding. What saved it, I think, was that it weighs so little. In short, if you order this t.v., pull it out of the box and inspect it, while your delivery person is still there, just in case."
4,affordable HDTV,"So far, it has proven to be just as hoped for. No problems. Easy setup. Great picture. I am naive about the high definition part so far but will learn. I have to get it hooked up to a digital signal signal first. Regular TV and using the coaxial cable and the SUPPLIED HDMI cable DVD's look and work great in that horiz format. This is what we could afford and I can't see a difference in quality with more expensive ones yet. I would get one again."
4,big bang for the buck,"havent had the tv very long maybe a month so far so good its on the grainy side the closer u get to it but think theyre all that way, so far i feel its a great buy.."
2,Not what expected.,"My 25"" NEC tube TV of 18 years went on the blink again. I've had it reparied a few times for $150.00 here $200.00 there and pondered replacing it with another tube TV like 27"" Sony Trinitron or Samsung for $379.00. But then I saw this Sylvania 26"" HDTV for $499.00 and thought it was time to move up to high tech for a few dollars more. I ordered it and received great service with quick 2 day delivery. However, I was immediately dissapointed with the picture quality, much worse then my old TV of 18 years, but I still had hope because I was still waiting for my HD cable box. After 10 days I got my HD cable box installed and while I saw a big improvement it was still not the quality picture I expected. So from about a $200.00 repair of my old TV to $379.00 new tube TV to $499.00 HDTV I returned the Sylvania 26 HDTV and ordered a 32"" Samsung HDTV LNS3251S form Amazon and am VERY pleased with this new TV. Great picture in HD and digital plus happier with the larger screen."
4,Awesome TV,We ordered this HDTV for our 18 year old son for Christmas after doing some local in store browsing. The picture is so clear! Our son loves it. I ordered it at 9am on Wed (after Christmas) and it was at our house the next day with FREE SHIPPING!! We are very pleased.
1,A fraud and a hypocrite!,"Mr. Armey is my age and like me he says he loves freedom - (""true freedom carries with it responsibility and accountability"") Yet unlike me and others of my generation who were in the military either voluntarily or through conscription, Armey never served his country. Which makes his claim that he is a patriot ring so hollow. Mr. Armey, if you claim to be a patriot and love freedom, why did you not serve your country? What happened to your ""responsibility and accountability? You, sir, are nothing but a hypocrite asking others to stand up for freedom while you were `exempt' from the draft. Shame on your sir! Grow up and be a man!"
4,Clairvoyance and Occult Powers,"Panchadasi does an excellent job discussing telepathy, clairvoyance, and other occult subjects. This book holds a wide range of topics including astral projection and psychic influence. The author gives definitions and how-tos in each lesson, providing all the information a reader may look for."
1,"100% same book as Panchadasi's book ""Clairvoyance and occult powers""","A T T E N T I O N !!! This is exactly the same book as Panchadasi's book ""Clairvoyance and occult powers"" only the name of book is different!!! Don't buy both, because you will have twice the same book. (as me :'( :)"
3,"Well-written, but disappointing","I recently moved to Paris and was anxious to explore the French countryside during weekends and holidays. Bought this book, full of hope, and enjoyed reading about many possible places to stay. All of them sound lovely in their descriptions. But when I actually stayed at several of the recommended B & Bs, I have been sorely disappointed. None has been better than average, and all I've seen fail to live up to their glowing endorsements."
1,Waste of Time,Rather poorly written. And why would I want to buy a book about succeeding in the music business by a musician who's basically been a failure in the music business?
2,Not what I Expected,It's kinda flimsy and not what I expected...doesn't zest lemons like I want it to. It takes too long when I am baking my famous lemon pound cake with lemon glaze.I'll stick with my box grater until I try one of those other hand-held graters. Maybe a microplane is what I really wanted.
4,Functional Grater,For the price it does more than you can ask. It feels as though it will break over time as the plastice doesn't feel all that strong.However if you're willing to spend twice as much I would highly recommend buying microplane grater as these are much more durable.Would buy again at this price though.
4,Stop whining about copy-protection!,"Good music on this CD, like it better than the original soundtrack. If the copy protection bugs you THAT much, get a decent cd-ripper that doesn't require the tracks to be labeled as audio. The copy-protection isn't THAT advanced."
1,"Surprise, sursprise ...",Since my CD player died two years ago I am using only CD player in my computers (both at home and at the work) to listen music. Tough luck with this CD - does not work. I got my monie back. Will not buy anything more from Universal.
1,Nice job Universal,"The fact that I can't listen to this CD on my Mac is ridiculous. I don't own a cd player anymore since my last one broke down. I bought a turntable DVD player because it played CD's as well. ... THAT's what's going to get them coming back... make the disks unusable by some people but not all. ... Anyways, thanks, but no thanks. Oh... and incidentally, the CD [stinks] anyways."
1,Do not buy any Sony CDs,"Do not buy this CD or any other CD either made by Sony or labeled ""Copy Protected"". These CDs are known to be infected with DRM and contain programs that compromise the usability and security of your computer. Anti-virus programs are now classifying these DRM programs as rootkits and are cleaning them off of the infected computers."
1,No Mac Playback,Have to to go extreme steps to get it to play back on my Mac. I f***ing hate crappy DRM.
3,Found the song from party after chase!,"Hello Kelli & Ronster: like you both and, I believe, like lots of music interested people who are frustrated by not finding the BEST song from the FF movie on the soundtrack CDs... here it is:- After the car chase (Brian saves Dominic) when they ENTER Dominic's house (not when they're already there, dcnblues...) there's a party going on and there is playing NUREGA, BY ORGANIC AUDIO. Look for the album ""Last One Home"" by Organic Audio here at Amazon.com, it's the 9th track, and IT'S WONDERFUL!"
4,Why bother?,"Sure this CD and the one before it are both GREAT CDs, but as mentioned in previous posts, they lack some tracks. Seeing as I own the DVD, I simply ripped every song off of it, converted to MP3, and burned it onto two discs that now sit happily in my CD changer. Just about anybody with a computer that has a DVD drive can do this...there are instructions all over the place. Also, I read somewhere that if you simply blacken out the outer edge of the disc with a marker or something, the copy protection is defeated. Has anyone tried this? I don't feel like screwing up a CD that does work on my Mac, regardless of ""copy protection."""
2,Doesnt play in any cd player i own,"Hey people can you help me out member that song when brian pulls up in the red lightning to get lunch and the rockish hip hop soundin song was like "" OOOOOOO "" I want that song any ideas who the artist [...]"
2,two star for music only...,i bought this disc way back when it first came out and the only thing i could use to listen to it was my old cd boom box and a discman. i really wish i would have known it screwed up computers cause that would have explained why every time i installed it to WMP i would have to reset everything on my computer. that would also explain why my e-machine was compromised within a day after ripping this disc to my WMP. tons of viruses and trojans! sad thing is only a limited number of these songs are available on itunes so you can't even compile the album that way. very disappointed.
5,song?,"Does anyone know the song right after the Race Wars scene? It's during the nighttime party after Vin Diesel beats Rick Yuen. It's a trance/techno song, and it's really good. Please e-mail me at drummstik@gmail.com"
5,THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!,OMG THANKZ YOU SOOOOOOOO MUCH LULU!!!!! I LOVE YOU!! *MUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUAH* LOL!!
2,it's not a great CD,"I you love the movie, don't go to buy this CD.It's very disapointement for me.Not song I love in the movie don't appeared on this CD."
3,better of the first but...,"The original CD are not good but the second are better.BUT it's not a very good CD like the movie.Buy the DVD, not the CDs...."
3,Cool music from a nice moovie... and no problems at all...,Like it a lot... it make me feel like I drive a toyota supra when I listen this CD in my car. All songs except one r recorded really good... my pioneer car audio make it sounds really cool... :) and don't have problems playing this CD in my PC - so dunno how come I c here ppl that r unable to use this CD... I think they r just flamers...
1,Useless for me,"Has some good tunes. BUT: If I can't play it on my computer, I can't listen to it most of the time. If I can't rip it to my MP3 player, I can't listen to it the rest of the time. That is what copy-protection does: It penalizes the legitimate user and violates the Fair Use Doctrine (possibly violating the Constitution) while doing nothing to stop the dedicated pirates. (Does anyone really think the copy-protection on this disk will stop 1000's of copies showing up in the big eastern black markets?)Do yourself a favor and stay away from CD's that may not play on your CD player and, even if they do, may be useless if you buy a new one.Do you really want to take the chance that your music and your financial investment might disappear if your CD player bit the dust and you had to buy a new one?"
1,CD Hound,"I took this CD home only to find out it didn't work in my DVD player which is the only player I use to play my movies & CD's. So I put in the computer player to see if it would play in it if there was something wrong w/my DVD player, no joy. After a lot of searching around I come to find out it's been altered to not play in my players WHAT A STUPID IDEA this was. Some idiot at UNiversal should be sacked for this, when DVD players came out there a lot of people I know use these players to play both their movies & CD's, takes less room in the stereo cabinent and why have so many players. Well as it turns out Universal has been receiving much flack over this a lot of returns have been made at retail outlets. The stores aren't having it as it wastes their time in returns.If I buy my own CD with my money I expect the CD to work for me, don't protect the CD from working for me that's accusing me of illegal activity I haven't done."
1,Don't buy this CD! It doesn't work!,Don't buy this CD! It doesn't work! It won't play in my car CD player and it won't play in my computer CD player!...
1,Avoid at all costs,"Do not buy this CD. It would not let me play it on my computer. Supposedly this is to protect the musicians but all it really does it is show how greedy the record company is. I listen primarily to my CDs at work on my computer and with this CD I couldn't. In terms of the music, it is OK but not great (not as good as the movie). If you do buy this CD, return it asap."
2,Copy PRO what???,"This cd is ""copy protected"" however I was able to stick it in my linux computer, play it with some software, but not others. I was also able to copy it with the standard tools that come with linux.Music is ok, but UMG needs to get these back by the truckload. screenshot at http://www.wolfenet.org"
1,Boycott Copy-Protected Music,"I ask everyone to NOT buy this title. The music is very good and is more than a step up from the original fast and the furous soundtrack, but get the music through a file-swapping program. If you want to keep listening to your music on both your stereo and your mp3 player, computer, or video game console, DON'T BUY!"
5,AWSOME CD,"i found this soundtrack much better then the first one, these tracks are more for the rock music lover, its a good cd to jam to"
1,good songs--but wont play--boycott!,"Boycott this! It wouldn't work on my 2 walkman, pc stereo and sony cd player. Boycott record companies that do this!"
1,Doesn't Work,"Well, don't get this CD. Not only doesn't it work on my Mac (thats expected since it say it right on the label!) but it doesn't work with my slightly ancient Sony CD player. Ok, so maybe its really ancient, but its still a CD player and it should friggin' work, but it doesn't."
1,Help a brotha out...,"does anyone have a track listing of this CD? or better yet, is that sweet techno song from the race wars rave scene on this disc (and what's it called)? thanks"
2,They still don't get it...,"So the first soundtrack was the rap essentials (or filler as I call it) and this soundtrack is the rock essentials but they still don't get it. The reason most people run out to buy a soundtrack is because they loved the music played throughout the film, and they still fail to include some of the main tracks we loved, songs by bands like Live and Dope that should have made it are substituted by multiple tracks by mediocre bands. Sure, I was glad to see `Superstar' show up, but why `Click Click Boom' is here is beyond me, and while I love `This Life' and `Crashing Around You' I don't see how they have anything to do with the movie. Next time instead of included THREE tracks by BT give us what the movie promised because, believe it or not, that's what we wanted to hear!"
2,Question about song answered,The Song that plays as they invade Johnny's house is Debonaire by Dope.. if you go to IMBD.com type in the movie and go to soundtrack listings.. it usually has all the songs in the movie. Welcome
4,Song Search...,"Any1 know the name of the song when Dominic and Brian come home to the party after the cop chase, and a techno song is playing?"
3,Song from 1st party at Dominic's,"""Music fan"", the 1st song you're after, if you mean after the city car chase (Brian saves Dominic) when they enter Dominic's house there's a party going on and there is playing NUREGA, BY ORGANIC AUDIO. Look for the album ""Last One Home"" by Organic Audio here at Amazon.com, it's the 9th track.[]z from Brazil!"
3,Can't copy?,"I bought this CD, I've listened to it and deemed it a great cd, worthy of a 4-star rating. But I am commonly using diffrent CD palys to play CDs, instead of carying my CD collection around, I make a legal copy of the disc and keep one at each location, this CD dosen't allow me to do that. It infringes on my law given right to own a backup copy of items I legally own, this CD."
1,Mystery Solved,"The song that is played in the background while Paul Walker is driving his red pickup truck towards Torreto's deli is called ""Deep Enough"" (Remix) by the band called ""Live"". The album is called ""V"".[...]"
1,Unplayable,"Will *NOT* play in my car CD player, (a GM Saturn), my Sony portable CD player, my Apple Macintosh G4 DVD-ROM drive, my Playstation 2, or anything other than a single, solitary CD clock radio. This is not acceptable, and I returned the CD. And the music isn't even that good. Don't waste your money on a CD that is only playable on a very limited number of CD players. And shame on Universal for releasing a disc with such horribly limited copy protection. Not everyone who plays CD's in their computer pirates the CD, and not everyone runs Windows. And it's quite insulting to be treated like a criminal for wanting to play a CD I bought on a system that plays every other CD out there."
1,I would never buy this cd.....,or any other cd with copy protection. I don't rip cd's and share them so why should I pay... for a crappy cd that won't even play on my computer or wherever I choose to listen to it.
1,Good cd... better burned,"After buying this cd, i found out the only place i could play was on my friends portabled player, so i returned it. This is because of the 'protection', which is bull since it basically says that they dont trust their customers. I normally dont download illegal mp3's, but i made an exception. The cd protection isnt perfect, so there are some copies on the net. I also made myself a protetion free cd... I highly reccomend it. Just think of it as a consolation gift for them wasting your time."
2,"It works. It is a weaker charger compare to the one ""make"" by Motorola","It works. It is smaller than the Motorola charger. It is cheap, and it feel and look just as cheap. It is weaker (less power output) charger compare to the one make by Motorola. I don't like the way Bargain Cell's marketing at all. I order 10 auto and 10 wall chargers for $48.9, but they charge me $82.00 shipping and handling! It was ship ground. You should multiply the list price by 3 to 4 time to get the real price. It still come out slightly cheaper than other online store. But I don't like this kind of deceptive price at all. -ve 5 star for that."
4,it worked for me,"i remember the day my mom got me this book in 1997, i was 11 years old, having had the minor sex ed in school but none too detail specific i was filled with questions. so i was given this book, my mom simply said, read it and if you have any questions come straight to me. it taught me alot, and i remember learning things and reading about things that i had misunderstood for a while. i think it may be too graphic for younger readers, but at the middle school age (11-up) i think its quite age appropriate. so if your concerned, take a read thru it and decide whether or not you want to give it to your young lady. i have just purchased it for my neice at the insistence of my brother."
2,I Agree!,"I agree with the reviewer who wrote the parental warning. I tried to submit a similar review when I first got this book in December of 2000, but Amazon edited it out because I mentioned some of the chapter headings on various forms of sex covered in the book. I guess in four years' time mentioning oral and anal sex has become more acceptable. I bought the book because I had found Mavis Jukes' first book to be so helpful, wry and well written. While this book is indicated as a book for pre-teens, it is much more advanced in it's sexual content than I felt my then 11 year-old was ready to read about. Now that she is almost 15, I am thinking about bringing it down from the topmost shelf of the cabinet where it has collected dust for the last 4 years. Be warned that it is not really appropriate reading for a pre-teen, at least not in my hosehold, and certainly not without heavy parental input and discussion."
5,This is a great book!,"My friend and I read this book together and we both thought it was great. Even though we had already studied human sexuality that year, it still told us some things we would have to know that our teacher didn't tell us, such as bra sizes."
1,re-recordings of hits,If you enjoy re-makes and re-recordings of great hit songs then this one is for you. If you prefer the original hits then stay well clear of this one.
5,Great suspense,I was very pleased with this film. I have watched it several times and enjoy it and see more each time. I highly recommend it...
2,"Good Collection, But Unimpressive Presentation","In my opinion, this book is just a collection of the four documents that have or do define the pillars that support the foundation of America. The author tries to convey his goal in interpreting these four documents but he does a poor job at making the goal clear. The consequence is that the reader is left to ponder exactly what points are being made throughout. And in the end, the conclusion is effectively meaningless since there was no possibility for the reader to achieve a focus on the gist of what Cox intended. I would not recommend this book unless all you want are these four founding documents under one cover."
2,Not what I ordered,"When I received my item I was disappointed to see it was Nothing like what I ordered! It was flat black and graphics were nothing like pictured on the web site. I really had my heart set on the other one for my son and was so excited, if I had known I would have not got it.Really to bad! Lesson learned!"
3,good for costume,the netting is black and sliver thread which I like. Its a little bit scratchy but not too bad. they are long and have a high waist which is a little tight. Im folding it back down to my hips over my petticoat. Fine for costume. but not everyday.
1,Very Disappointed,I was very disappointed in this ring when it arrived. The center stone looks very fake. The setting itself is beautiful so I have kept the ring set with plans to replace the center stone in the future.
5,SECRET KEY TO OPEN WOMEN LEGS,"WOW am i glad i got this for my girl, if you get this for your girl or just some chick you wanna bang it works, some say its the long lost key to open any pair legs from a lady...dont believe me then see what happens wen you dont give em a ring, then we'll see whos laughing....you jerks"
1,Siddartha,"This book was dry and boring. It was suposed to teach a lesson, but I failed to find it useful. I would never recommend this book to anyone."
4,Very informative and Philosophical,"I have tried to quit smoking many times, but I always went back to smoking when times got rough. This book helped me deal with the tough times: I really enjoyed the Chapters on spirituality: Free will, Non Judgment, The message and the two chapters on meditation. I was horrified reading about all the chemicals and toxins and the second-hand smoke research within the book. The book makes a lot of sense about going inward to quit smoking. For those who have had a difficult time with quitting, going inward has helped me and gave me strength to deal with my addiction and realize that I have the power to say no.. It sounds simple, and it is. The book is a bit harsh at times, but all and all I has helped me not want to go back to smoking."
1,Doesn't fulfil any of its promises,"This book is just rubbish, in my opinion. It's full of typos. It's written in barely readable English. It just waffles on. It does have a little bit of useful content, but from the reviews you'd think it was terrific, and I promise you, it absolutely is not."
3,Not what I've come to expect from Fayrene!,"I usually read Fayrene Preston's books from cover to cover in one sitting. However, I had to drag myself through this one. The writing just isn't up to her usual witty yet sensual work. It was more formulaic boy-meets-girl, then X happens and Y happens because that's how it's supposed to work. I didn't find myself draw to the characters or wrapped up in their story. While it's not awful, it doesn't have the spark I have come to anticipate and relish from Ms. Preston's books."
4,fairly happy,the book cover i THOUGHT i was buying was not the one i recieved.. however it was still in good condition and arrived quickly. so overall still happy
3,"Good writing, interesting ideas.","Deals with the problem of how human mutants, superior to their fellows, might seek to bring about a better world. Simak offers many interesting ideas and a good overall plot, but the book has a bit of a cardboard, comic-booky feeling to me, with the characters and their actions and dialogue a little cliched. Entertaining, but I don't think it is as good as his ""Way Station."""
5,My favorite CD,"I absolutely love this CD. Not only the hauntingly beautiful sound of Brahms music, but the glorious performance of these pieces; particularly the angelic, ethereal voices of the choir. I bought this CD because of the ""Vier Gesange"" for womens voices, 2 horns and harp, and I was not disappointed. The performance brings chills to my skin, particularly in the third song as the womens voices bloom and swell in the final phrase of each verse. Despite choosing this CD for one specific piece, I fell in love with all of the music, some familiar Brahms choral works, and others pieces I had never heard before. I highly, highly recommend this disc to anyone who is a lover of Brahms or choral music, or to ANYONE who has an interest in listening to exquisitely sung, absolutely gorgeous vocal music."
4,"very entertaining, but re-viewability may not be too high.","the characters are enjoyable to watch. a good movie for Tim Curry fans, Tom Arnold fans, or Bruce Campbell fans... as their characters are played out very well. great writing, fantastic direction, and the acting is fun to watch because the actors seem to have genuinely enjoyed doing this movie. the only thing is, this may only be a ""rental"" for most people... not a ""buyer"". check it out at your local block-buster or family video first, you may be pleasently suprised."
2,Good for a short laugh...,"Good for a few laughs if you can get past the obvious and numerous technical goofs (like the villian talking into the wrong side of the microphone!). The only real saving grace is the comedic talent of the cast, but Tim Conway they are not!"
3,An OK film,"Okay, I admit, I saw the film because Bruce Campbell is in it. He does a great job, and the film is very funny, just a little hard to swallow."
3,movie arent like the old day,"another so so plot, which kinda turns you off after a while, but it was watchable, better than having to return a dvd"
1,Crapware - deserves zero stars,"I've tried all of the installation methods listed at Roxio's website. Not only will Roxio EMC 9 not install properly and run, it disabled my PC from starting Windows XP. I had to revert to he last known good configuration to recover from the disaster of the EMC 9 installation.If I had the time and money, I would file a class-action lawsuit against Roxio."
1,Roxio Media 9 review,"First, Roxio should make it clear that this suite of applications does not handle photo raw data. You have read through everything advertised to find that this feature is missing.The slide show has to be the worst. I still can not find out how to do a full view. If you need to make a change you have to reload all the pictures again - this is the software doing this and it takes a lot of time. You can not just jump from running you slide show to making a modification.Very dissappointed with the product. The software I received with my Olympus Camera works better.Overall, the program is slow and has caused my laptop (which is new)to freeze and which causes me to have to go through a restore because after rebooting I am forced to run in safe mode."
1,Worst customer service experience ever.,"I'm looking right at my original box, my original disk and my original CD with the CD Key sticker still on it. But the Roxio website won't let me download the product upgrade because it says the CD key is invalid. I called the customer service number and was told that customer service by phone is only available for downloaded purchases.Do not waste your time buying Roxio. If you do and you expect any service you might do better to download the product. If you buy the retail version they refuse to acknowledge you at all. Roxio used to make a nice product. Too bad. Roxio would do well to read all of the negative comments posted here and make some changes for the better."
1,Frustrating Crash Master for DVD editing,"I have owned a series of Roxio products in hopes that the bugs would be eliminated. No such luck with version 9. I am reluctant to switch DVD programs because of the steep learning curve, but this vesion has pushed me over the edge. Not only is it slow, and frequently locks up, and produces unusable DVDs, but it also trashes the project files. So not only does it fail to create a usable DVD, it also corrupts all the edits, menus, and other settings that required hours of tedius work. Extremely frustrating. A hundred bucks down the drain, but at least this is the last time."
1,Startup Problems are unsurmountable!,"What a mess!When I first installed Creator 9, I kept getting the message: Input code not recognized. I received no satisfatory help from Roxio/Sonic.I explained the problem to Amazon and they sent me another new copy.I have used it for about a month and am now getting a message that my trial period time has expired.So now, after already wasting many hours, I am about to start over again trying to get a working copy."
2,Long-time roxio user,"This new Creator version 9 has all the feel and faults of patchwork. Like many users, I'm unhappy with how slow it is. I could live with that, but it freezes when making videos (some other places too, but I mostly do video). There is NO HELP from Roxio. You are really on your own. They are not a customer focused company. The installation is sloppy and the uninstall is worse.Having said all that, it would be a good program if it just worked as advertised..."
1,Absolute junk,"Some features of this product may work. Some definitely do not.You should be aware that you are buying this product AS IS.THERE IS NO TECHNICAL SUPPORT.If you try to contact Roxio at their web-site's ""Web self-service"" you will be told you'll receive an e-mail telling you how. The e-mail will never come.If you call them, you will be put on hold indefinitely.If you attempt to contact a technician using their ""web chat"" you will be told you are 3rd, then 2nd, then 1st in the queue. Then you will be told that no technician is available.I strongly recomment that you purchase this product on your credit card so that you can dispute the charge if you find the product unsatisfactory."
1,Absoluty NO support from Roxio,"Be aware that if you purchase this product and have problems support from Roxio is almost non-existent. Support comes in two forms, 1) knowledge base where you can also enter a question with a response time days to weeks after you request a response. 2) paid assistance, which will quickly cost more than the product. Initially my install functioned correctly. Then if ceased to work indicating that a codec required authorization. However I was unable to ever get it to authorize. They advertize a 30 day money back guarantee, but having requested this, I advise that they have failed to respond to me and it's been more than a month. As it turns out I see many individuals in the Roxio forums with the same problem I have. I bought this software to produce a product, not to have an ""adventure""."
1,Be prepared for problems,"I've had Roxio products from 4.0 through 9.0. I always upgraded (in the past) because of old version problems, hoping a newer version would work better (it didn't). Easy Media Creator 9.0 is the worst of the lot. Once you buy a Roxio product, you can forget about any help when it doesn't work. Search the net for free burning programs, they are out there. I doubt if Roxio will be around in a few years, due to NO TECH SUPPORT for products that do not perform as they should. I'll never buy from Roxio again, Don't take my word for Rioxio products,check out all the reviews. very few people are happy.Roxio Easy Media Creator Suite 10"
1,There has got to be something better,I have used versions 8 & 9. There has to be something better. It won't run on Vista without a delete and reinstall. Making a slide show is a pain.
1,Roxio Easy Media Creator 9,"Under no circumstances should you purchase this product. It stopped working on my computer and when I reinstalled it, the product would not launch. In fact the icon on the desktop became non-functional after the required reboot. This product is flawed."
1,Worst Nightmare!,"As a software professional and previous Roxio 5 user, I had looked forward to upgrading Roxio Easy Media Creator Suite 9. A huge mistake. Despite several attempts to get the software to load and run correctly I kept receiving spurious & intermittent ""Buffer Overrun Detected"" error messages. A review of Roxio's Support website revealed that many people have had this error starting in September 2006. In fact, Roxio issued a patch on 1/5/07 (ID Number: 000115CR). Unfortunately, as I discovered, like others, the patch does not work. I attempted to post my concerns on Roxio's support website but even after logging in, Roxio had locked down their support site so I could not post. Hence, my post here.Bottom Line: Do NOT buy this product. It is buggy."
1,$15 price increase in one day,"I was going to buy this software from Amazon. I put it in my shopping cart and the next day when I went to purchase it I had found tha Amazon had raised the price from $65 to $80 overnight without warning. I am still going to purchase this software, but not from amazon."
1,Boy did I waste my money!,"It is hard to descibe how frustrated I am with this product. One would think that a ""suite"" with all the bells and whisles could perform a simple task like copying a CD without a problem. Not so. My system freezes every time. I upgraded from the free version 6 that came with my computer. Never had a problem with the free version. Also if you want to print CD labels, the old version used to list the various label manufacturers so that made setting up the correct alignment for printing was easy. Not so with the ""new and improved"" version. Roxio support page is a joke. Don't bother with the ""Ask Roxanne"" help section, you'll have better luck asking the question to your dog. Of course, you could look at the manual under ""troubleshooting"" or ""support"". Let me know if you find it. it's not in mine. This product is far too floated for it's own good."
3,roxio 9,"Many features but it seems a bit cluttered instead of one big program its more like a bunch of little programs, The video editing is simple and easy but to basic its hard to do certain things, also it wont work with the mini DVD burner on my camera for some reason. but i do look forward to using its many other features."
1,Don't Buy,"I used earlier versions of this software for years, and have been very satisfied in the past. This latest version however is not yet mature. It's buggy, it crashes, it doesn't do what I bought it for. I'm having all kind of aspect ratio issues with converting videos for the iPod format, and general format errors when saving video in mpeg-4 format, those files are not even opening up. The DVD authoring software also hangs or crashes. So overall I'm extremely disappointed, and agree with a previous reviewer: don't but till Roxio has made available patches for these issues."
1,VISTA Roxio will not load,"Roxio came preinstalled on my HP PC running Vista.I think the DVD portion works, BUTthe cd to MP3 convert Audio program will not even load.It worked once, but now it will not load hangs up"
3,Don't buy it until the first patch is made available,"I give Roxio credit for it's reliable buring of simple, data-to-disk projects, but must reprimand them for the included VideoWave Module. With it, you would have been able to edit video and export it to a variety of formats. Unfortunately, Videowave crashes during rendering without any error message - even if the project is less that 10 sec. in time.Since this program is very new to the market this and possibly many other errors may not be fixed until Roxio releases it's first patch for this product, so wating until the to buy Roxio Media Creator Suite 9 is possibly a great idea."
1,This software doesn't work - very frustrating!,"The software will not burn DVDs. I am able to capture and edit video (with some difficulty) but when I try to burn a DVD, the encoding process freezes - and that's as far as it goes.I have spent countless hours on the phone and online with Roxio Support. They have run me in circles without any progress. I have a new, powerful computer (dual core processor, 2G RAM, etc) so my computer is not the problem. I sent my computer's dxdiag details to Roxio and they agree that my computer exceeds requirements.Following the direction of Roxio support, I have performed a clean install, updated the firmware for my DVD drive, updated the driver for my video card, and downloaded a patch for the roxio record engine. I've done several other things I can't remember.I asked Roxio for a refund, but they refused.I have wasted too much time on this product. This review is the last effort I'm investing in it.My recommendation: buy something else."
1,Waste of Time & Money,"Installed 9.0 on a brand new Dell laptop. The CD drive immediately stopped working. Reloaded Windows XP to correct problem. Reinstalled 9.0, lost CD drive again. Uninstalled Roxio, drive works.This is, unfortunately, the abridged version of a problem that took several weekends to diagnose and treat."
2,Roxio Greed is ALIVE AND WELL,"Let's see, in the past year we've gone from 7 to 7.5 to 8 to 9. NEVER in the history of software has a company shown more GREED that this one. Instead of patches, or inexpensive upgraded to its customers who paid full price for the previous owners, Roxio has chosen to rip them off as much as possible, immediately ceasing support for the older versions and charging high prices for the new. This is a new level of greed and I worry if people are dumb enough to support it, it may proliferate. Don't support this pathetic company. What happens next? Version 10 comes out next week? Stop supporting Roxio's shareholders and avoid this product. tell them NO to the big ripoff"
1,NO SUPPORT,The only way to get support for Roxio products is to pay $35 per phone call! I had trouble with install & launch - they wouldn't help unless I paid an additional $35. That's highway robbery
1,Forget about it!,"I bought a Dell dimension 4600 that came with a sonic media program which Sonic/Roxie does not support. Horrible! So, I bought a full version MEDIA CREATOR SUITE 9 for my XP system thinking that Dell was just too cheap to install a descent version (which they were). Well......MEDIA CREATOR SUITE 9 is so full of bugs that my computer is breaking out with an unknown rash! You would be better served by flushing your hard earned cash down the toilet and save the postage. As far as the tech support goes, you might as well be talking to a cat which will be less costly."
2,I Don't Know Where to Begin...,"I really should have listened to the other reviewers' advice before purchasing this product: but I did not, and find myself experiencing the wrath of Roxio. WOW, this is a buggy program! In this first week, I actually got one DVD to burn correctly (after many attempts, crashes, tossed DVDs, etc.) and I have to admit it DID impress the family (hence the 2 star review). But the ""suite"" does not function properly, it crashes constantly, and worst of all, the program installs its own codecs (video drivers, etc.) during install which conflict with any existing drivers you have. The result: now I can no longer play .mpg movies on my computer. The fix is complicated and frankly, not worth the time and effort. I would suggest waiting for a major fix or upgrade or purchasing a different product altogether (Nero?) Save yourself the agony."
1,Useless program AVOID!!!,"I bought this program (EMC 9) to make DVD slide shows of digital photos, and some video DVDs that I could run on a television. Ths slide show creator worked only once, but I could use the video creator to creat slide shows for a while (with limited options), but now that won't work. Tech support offers no workable suggestions. The discussion group offers more suggestions, and clean installs seem to be a temporary fix at best. Now I can't even get the program to load. I might as well burn the $80 I spent on this."
2,buggy crash cazy software,"what a disappointment. if you feel like spending a chunk of money on this to do basic burning tasks, feel free. if you want to convert your MCE dvr-ms files to mpeg-4(Ipod)to play on your Ipod, forget it. it will crash crash crash. error messages abound. what a waste of money. but, hey, it can rip my cd's into MP3. Great! my media player does that and it's free."
1,Roxio is being DECEPTIVE,"This is by all means the WORST software product to come out in years. Beware all Media Center Edition 2005 users: EMC 9 will destroy your Media Center settings such as your TV Tuner and Media Center Receiver Service that regulates most of everything in MCE 2005.If you do try to get this software to work on your own, don't bother using the Roxio Support Forums, they are useless!!!!!!For those that are researching this product before you buy, don't use the Roxio Support Forums as any type of guage because they DELETE ALL NEGATIVE POSTS ABOUT THEIR PRODUCT DAILY!!!! Just do a search for ""EMC 9 IS A HEADACHE"" on Google and select the ""cache"" version and then try to view the ""full"" version of the page and you will see my point...it is not there. Roxio is in denial that their product is not ready for the mass market.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!Buy Sony Vegas+DVD or Pinnacle or Nero 7 Enhanced...ANYTHING BUT ROXIO EMC 9."
2,Version 9 and still maddeningly frustrating...,"I'm surprised that I'm feeling the same frustrated way now that I did with the last generations of Creator... I have a decent Dell PC that runs XP, and still Roxio will slow down and dominate my entire computer when in use. The program itself is not profoundly better than its predecessors, but still it chugs along (and crashes frequently). It also seems to choose when to see my drives - sometimes it ""forgets"" and then it is fine... I'm just surprised that such a plodding, cumbersome program has managed to be bundled with most of the computers shipped from Dell and HP (and probably others).If any similar (non-Roxio) program came along that just had the burning basics for CDs and DVDs down, I would grab it. Look for alternatives."
1,Crashes your computer,This is an absolutely most frustrating software package ever purchased. Just look at their website at all the problems people are experiencing with it. I haved spent hours and hours and hours trying to get the program installed and then to even run. It corrupted my registry and only God knows what else. Symantec gave up after 3 hours on line trying to find out what the Sonic Cineplayer Decoder package was and whether it was a virus. I have finally gotten everything off my computer by purchasing a registry cleaner software at great expense and am still working on trying to get everything I previously had working properly again. I am sending the program right back to Roxio for a refund as soon as I can get them to give me an RMA. Unless you are REAL computer guru my advice is to steer clear of Roxio and Sonic products. Sonics MyDVD has it's own set of problems.
3,Roxio 10 is out-imagine my surprise,About 2 weeks ago I ordered what I thought was the latest version of Easy Media Creator... imagine my surprise when I get around to loading up my brand new software and am offered the opportunity to upgrade to version 10. If I had but known a new version was coming out I might have managed to hold off... I am not a happy camper.
2,"Love it or leave it, I left it.","Like most EMC suites, it is intolerant of other media suites or media burning software.It will install perfectly on a clean copy of WIN2K or XP. Starting out with an existing OS that has been running for sometime will most likely have installation or operational issues.I DON'T like the way it has to get to the internet every time you do start it, (I firewall block it); it puts too many drivers and services on your OS, and does NOT work properly right out of the box. You have to go immediately online to get the updates.Tech support is a joke for the kind of money they want per issue. Maybe they should have shipped a stable product first.Me, I find NERO is the better choice of a media suite now."
1,roxio easy media creator 9,"This software is complete. It has a lot of applications,all intergrated into one.But when i launch an application, i get an mfc application error. This software probably was released a little bit to early.I believe it needs a major update.....but their site.....when it comes to updates.....it's way too slow. I recommend not to buy this software....unless a major update is relesed first."
1,"Rate 10 on XP, Rate 0 on Vista, Rate Customer Support 0","This program works great on an XP environment, but is almost useless on a Vista machine. Roxio has absolutely no customer support. They have been promising a Vista patch for months. I have used the product all the way back to Version 4, but I am now looking for a replacement product. I would not waste your money"
1,ECM v9,This is the worst Roxio product to date! The company apparently feels that its time to rip off their customers. The program hogs system resources and despite removing some of the more demanding apps I have yet been able to get this program to run smoothly despite having an up to date and capable HP computer. I would ask for my money back but who would you ask? I cant even find support for this piece of @#%* Nice try Roxio! Look elsewhere for a professionally designed and written program.
4,surprisingly pleasant and useful software suite,"This suite, in my opinion, is what software should be. It was easy to install, and is well integrated with the operating system, but is not obtrusive. This media suite contains an armful of handy tools, plus the bread-and-butter applications like DVD-authoring, disc burning, and media playing. The DVD-authoring application is somewhat slow, but it burns DVDs just fine.The best part of this entire software suite? It didn't mess with my file associations AT ALL! That's right, this piece of software will not commandeer your system (at least, it didn't force a hostile takeover of mine). I get the best of both worlds: all these useful tools, but only when I want them."
1,Many Bugs and No support,"This has to be the worst software package I have ever used. I picked this up on impulse while visiting a relative. I should have done a lot more research but... This software has sooo many bugs. Most programs lockup or won't complete a process and it seems like you have to register each component of the suit separately.Don't make my mistake. Research the product before you buy. Go to the support forums and find out how frustrated users are. Buying this product would be a BIG mistake.Oh, and Roxio will not give you a refund unless you by from their store.Use NERO for burning.Use Adobe Premier Elements for editing.And stay away from Roxio/Sonic"
1,Buggy trash,"I was happy using an old version of Nero and read one of the on-line reviews of Roxio Medai Creator 9. It was a glowing review and I (foolishly) bought a copy. First tip that things would not go well was that it insisted that I uninstall Nero, which I, nervously, let it do.Well I've had it about two months now and it is incredibly buggy. I have had to do three repairs to get it to do the basic things like just copying a DVD or CD. It's labelling ""feature"" is junk that also locked up the first time I tried it. Don't even dare try any of the ""advanced"" features.Complete, enraging, trash.Back to Nero for me."
1,Full of bugs and glitches,I have used version 8 and now version 9. I bought it for video primarily but cannot use it now due to an issue with the MPEG-2 installation which Roxio licenses from another company. Been trying to get an answer or fix for months but Roxio does not appear to want to fix the problem as they have to pay royalties for every activation.
1,"Claims to be Vista ready, but isn't","I upgraded to Suite 9 because my older version wouldn't work with Vista, and Roxio advertised Suite 9 as being Vista compatible. It isn't. Vista will not load it, because it has several drivers which are not Vista compatible. A visit to the Roxio website does not uncover any updates or downloads which will make it compatible, so it is a sheer waste of money, and is misrepresented by Roxio."
1,Not ready to be released (as of 5/4/07),"First off, I like Roxio, I've used previous versions and it's good, it's a bit bloated and the interface is ho-hum, but it's fine: it does a good job. I bought a new computer and of course my old versions are XP only, that's cool. I honestly don't mind coughing up a bit of cash for a quality suite that I can depend on. This software claims to be cool with Vista, it is not. Not even a little. It installed for me fine (hint, right click on the installer and run as an administrator - it helps). I wanted this software to do three things: 1) burn audio CDs 2) burn DVDs and 3) import video from MiniDV tapes. It can't do any of those things without crashing! How, oh how, is that at all vista compatible. Uhh, yeah, it's not. It's good full featured software, but only if you're running XP or if they release some kind of miracle patch that'll make their software not suck (for vista). Meanwhile, I'm shopping for a new Burning suite."
3,Not Real Pleased,"As a previous owner of Ver 8, I discovered after installing it that Napster was bundled with it. I did not want Napster, so I uninstalled it...bad mistake. After that I kept getting error message ""unable to start ?? engine"". Uninstalling and reinstalling did not correct. AfterGoogling for answers, I think everyone was having the same types of problems. Nothing worked. Because of other applications that required Roxio, I was forced to buy Ver. 9 and install. This corrected the problem, but I am not pleased with auto installing bundled software that has nothing to do with Roxio."
1,Forget it!,"You better have a very powerful computer if you want this program to function properly. Even then, I'm not so sure that it will.Every time I use it, it ""hangs"" somewhere.I am no novice - This is a poorly written program - full of features that sound fine, but do not function properly - at least not on my Dell pentium IV 2.4 GHz computer."
1,Error,"I bought this for my son so he could burn music CDs and transfer video and music between his iPod and our PC. Bottom line: all I've been able to do is get errors and spend my time trying to fix and/or re-install the darn thing. Supposedly there is a ""hot fix"" for the most basic error on the Roxio Web site, but clicking on the download link produces another error. Well, I guess it was an error to get this product. Buyer beware...it seems to work on some systems and not others since I have a family member that has not experienced any problems with it."
1,Don't waste your money,Roxio Creator 9 is a waste of money. The program should never have been released. Make sure you install the patch for the runtime error. After that I tried using burning a CD and it would keep telling me to insert a music CD. There was a music CD inserted and Roxio Drag and Drop saw the files but the burning side of Roxio did not.Tech support in non-existent. Their on-line FAQ is a total joke that is useless. I had all the latest firmware for my CD and DVD burner and 1 out of 10 times Roxio would actually work. I have already received my RMA # to return the product for a refund. I wish I had read the many negative reviews on this product before I made my purchase.
1,Don't even try it.,"I have worked with dvd burning software for a long time now. Most of the time it was smooth sailing. But Somewhere when Roxio was created everything went wrong. This horrible PILE of Ccleaner Actually Destroyed 2 dvd burners. The first one I thought just died of natural causes. So I put in a new one. It worked great with nero. So I tried Installing roxio 9 again. And Holy Ccleaner It doesnt recognize blank dvd's any more either. Even with a firmware update afterwards It still doesn't recognize blank dvd's. So like the title, Dont even Try It. You may end up with a dead drive. And Pay for it."
1,Incompatibility issues,"After three days of frustration of checking drivers, verifying compatibility of hardware configurations, etc. etc,the software will still not burn a DVD. Just check Roxio's on-line support forum and you will see several pages of customers experiencing similar DVD burning issues as well as many other problems with this product. Version 9 should not have been released with the myriad of incompatibility issues it has. I will never purchase another Roxio product because of it."
1,What a mistake!,"I bought this so that I could burn DVDs from my Windows XP Movie Maker. I paid full price becuase I really wanted it to work, and I figured now I would not have any problems becuase I was getting all the bells and whistles. I open the ""My Videos"" part, and it just freezes every time. So I can't open my project, edit it, or burn it. What a waste of money. I totally regret buying this. How could they put something on the market that doesn't even work? And even though I ""uninstall"" it, I can see that it has not totally let go of my computer. I wish I had checked out other's Amazon ratings before I ran out and took the salesman's word for it."
4,A welcome improvement,This version works with Windows much better than previous issues. I fact so far I've found no conflects.
1,Absolute Worst Piece Of Junk Program I've EVER Used,The programmers wouldn't know simplicity if it poked them in the eye. Even my ex-wife wasn't this frustrating.
1,THE WORST UPGRADED EVER!!!!,"Easy media creator 9 is the worst upgraded ever made by roxio, its incompatible with version 8 and has a lot of bugs, not worth the agravation of install and removed. better stay with v7.5."
2,For the few elements that work: OK,"I got this program a while ago and have been trying to get it to work since. I must say it's a grave disappointment. I can copy CDs all right, usually. The photo element, when the work--they usually don't--are okay. Most of the rest of it? Well, I describe it as the most capricious program I've EVER had. Sometimes it works, most of the time it doesn't.A grave disappointment.Consider something else before you dive into Roxio."
3,Roxio Easy Media Creator Suite 9,This software does everything......except burn a DVD. I had to switch back to version 8.
1,Don't waste your money,"This program is not worth the headache it will give you. It consumes all of the processing power(100%) of my 1.6GHZ Thinkpad. It's incredibly slow at nearly all tasks; burning a DVD takes hours! It will take three hours to burn a simple DVD and there may not be any data on the DVD! Very curious program - it doesn't even know if it successfully burned a disk. This program wins the prize for bugs; you never know what is going to happen when you click on something.It has multiple product activations for video, audio, and even the ringtones maker. I called Roxio tech support and they told me to disable all other services on my computer and the program will run properly!! Don't bother with this one."
1,Rough around the edges - and in the middle,"Roxio's Easy Media Creator suite is jam-packed with features. So many, in fact, that quality control had insufficient time to check to see if things were working. I have tried making a CD label, editing video, and burning a DVD and found several bugs along the way. Dialogs often allow you to enter information but don't use that information - so good luck aligning your CD labels with your printable decals or changing the level of compression on your DivX video export."
1,Just not acceptable,"I bought Roxio 8 because of the rich feature set thinking that there'd be a patch to fix the bugs (which are NOT just in video wave). They haven't come up with a patch, just another buggy product. As consumers we should NOT be purchasing Roxio's next version trash. We should get them to deliver something that works first before shelling out again."
1,Wouldn't install,"Although the seller's description said it would work in Win2K, I couldn't get it to install on either of my Win2K systems.I marked one star because I had to in order to submit this review. Otherwise, I wouldn't have marked any."
1,Roxio 9 Not worth Buying,"I have this product and it does not work as described. Nothing but troubles. Look for another vendors product. Roxio support will have you chasing your tail, doing this and that and what is really wrong is the software, not your PC. Do not buy this software unless you want a lot of headache. I would rate this No stars if I could. I have spent hours messing withg this software and many more house trying to get ti to ununstall, it infests your PC like a pack of rats!"
1,RUN TIME Errors (Don't waste your money),This software is terrible. I get so many RUN TIME errors I am so sick of that I am writing this review to save you the headaches.
2,Bloated and buggy,"I have tried to use this product (running on Windows XP Professional) for several months now and am not pleased. Problems encountered: (1) slow to load. each component seems to be a separate application that takes unreasonably long to load when activated. (2) Unstable. often encounters problems and shuts down, loosing work accomplished. (3) Won't recognize blank Memorex DVD+R DL disks. Recommend looking for a better alternative."
4,Good enough,"Cannot put it on two/three computers, needs activation to run.. Probably have to buy another license from Roxio or buy another copy for $40.... Works with Vista Ultimate/xp64! Make sure ur copy is new and/or unregistered!"
1,Stay away from Roxio,"After buying this, it installed a lot of programs that I didn't want. When I tried to selectively install what I did want, none of the programs would work. So I had to do a full install. Video editing would lock up every 10 or 20 minutes, which was usable I just saved often. Then it started locking up every minute which wasn't enough time to get anything done. On their customer forums, every problems seems to be answered with ""uninstall and do a clean reinstall."" I had done that twice already so I gave up and uninstalled it to move on to something new. Now it has broken my codecs and won't play any video without asking for a file that I can't find. This software is nothing but a huge hassle and waste of money. Instead of making patches they just start selling suite 10 which is probably just as bad."
1,Roxio,"The worst software I ever buy! Don't spend your money for something, that don't work. You will spend a lot more money for upgrades and spyware after you buy it!Zev"
1,Find a different video editor,"I had used an earlier version of Roxio's Creator. When I tried to install it on my current computer I found that the older version would not install. Expecting a possible fault with the disk I purchased the newer version (not the latest). The new disks appear to be manufactured by copying the program to ""home burned"" CDs. Now none of my four computers would read the program disk.There are better video editors with higher probability that you will not have difficulty installing into Windows XP."
1,Buggy and unsupported,"Sonic, the current owners of this product suite, have a history of leaving bugs unfixed until they product the next (for fee) version upgrade. That was the case with EMC 9, reviewed here, and I expect, if history is any judge, will be the case with version 10 as well."
1,DVD Creator (Videowave) simply doesn't work,"I have Windows Vista Ultimate and the software simply doesn't work. I have tried everything including contacting their horrible support (email only). This product has been nothing but a headache. I'm looking to buy Adobe Premiere Elements, hopefully that's better."
1,"Difficult, clunky program","This works relatively well for music files, but it is somehow difficult to use for photos and other files. Extremely frustrating. Consider other programs."
2,Definitely worse than I expected,"This is mind-boggling. A software package that offers so much but is so unstable you can't trust if its going to finish its task or crash your computer. I tried on two ocassion to transcode a video clip and each time within 20 minutes the computer freezes. On another ocassion the computer rebooted. However, I think this has to do with the whether the computer is set to stand by or not. I've noticed just before the computer is set to go into stand by it will lock up. But, this should not be happening because the computer is still actively working. Thus, this must be a flaw in the software's programming. It's a loaded program that can do just about anything with video and audio. Just too bad its riddle with major flaws."
1,"Slow, buggy software - Don't bother","I have used Roxio Easy CD Creator for years and have generally been happy with it. Of all the software that is in EMC 9, Easy CD Creator is the only one that seems to work well. This one piece of software is all that earns EMC 9 its single rating star from me.I just used the MyDVD software in this package to burn some Tivo programs to DVD. MyDVD is probably the slooooooowest, most miserable DVD authoring program I have ever used. I regularly use Pinnacle Studio and on occasion use Adobe Premiere Elements, so I know what is possible and what to expect. The only reason I can see for anyone to stoop so low as to use MyDVD for DVD authoring is when they want to burn Tivo programs - since MyDVD is the only software that seems to understand the Tivo format supported by Tivo Desktop.I've attempted to use several of the other software pieces in this package and have noted many crashes and abrupt endings to my attempts."
1,Roxio is incapable of making a product that works,"I used to have an older verion on Roxio on my Dell Pentium 4 and from the very start this program would constantly crash, lock up, and fail while burning CD's. I used to think that my computer was too slow to handle the software. Well, I purchased a brand new computer with the newest version of Roxio pre-installed on it. Guess what? It does the same thing. It crashes constantly. It fails constantly. It locks up. It can't even manage to do the simplest of things like properly register the software via the internet. I decided to compare Roxio by downloading a demo version of Nero. Wow! What a difference! Nero blows this product out of the water. I couldn't delete the Roxio from my computer fast enough. Unfortuantely I was out the $$ for their program. They don't provide any sort of guarantee with their product. Don't waste your time or money on Roxio software!"
1,where only fools dare to tread,"by the time i gave up trying to install this piece of cr@p, i had torn what was left of my hair out, my face was bloody from pounding it against the keyboard and i had to borrow a neighbors computer to write this as pieces of mine are still stuck in the wall across the room.I would rather smash my genitalia in a hot waffle iron than ever attempt to contact their customer 'dis'service again.if this sounds like your idea of a good time, go for it and buy this program!"
1,Save You Money,"In the past Roxio Easy Media Creator has been pretty good. Unfortunately, release 9 has all the polish and usability of something created by a couple of guys in their garage over a weekend. To start, Roxio forced me to uninstall my previous version (8) but in my case left behind 400 plus megs of no longer needed or usable files. After installation and on first use, the program choked and froze. Three tries later, it was still freezing at different points. The solution, according to Roxio's help desk after three calls, was a fresh ""clean"" install. This requires you go to the Microsoft web site, download a hidden programs control panel and remove all the Roxio files manually, edit the register (dangerous) and on and on. There's more but I won't take up your time. After a fresh clean install, it still crashes. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY OR YOUR TIME. Wait 6 months for a cleaned up version."
1,Don't even think about buying this product!,"This program completely freezes my computer while encoding--EVERY time. Having spent over three hours on the telephone with tech support--almost an hour of it waiting for a person to answer--I have found NO HELP in solving this problem, and according to the person I spoke with, this company has no physical address, no email address, and there are no supervisors at the company. Tech support cannot call out, you cannot email them directly, and the tech support have no phone extensions. I have never been so disgusted with a company. I may as well have lit $70 on fire than to buy this useless ripoff."
1,"Sure, it can do a lot of things, but . . .","I am so frustrated with Roxio. I have been using it for months now, and like a number of it's features. They can do a lot of things in one package. However, I'm finally fed up with the product. For the umteenth time, I pull it up to work on something today and it fails to let the part I want to run open. The main screen comes up and some of the features work fine. However, features that worked fine last week do not now. You can click on them and they just fail to start up. I run an extremely well maintained and fast computer and don't have problems like this with any other software. I will now have to reinstall the program YET AGAIN. Maybe you are supposed to just reinstall it every time you want to use a feature? Maybe that's the plan.I'd give this a 5 for the value if it didn't keep failing and requiring installation or some fix. It's nearly beyond useless to not work so often when you are trying to get something done."
5,Great Program,"I have used the program for three months now and I have not encountered a problem. I am not sure where all of the complaints are originating besides people not knowing what they are doing? There is a tool section that allows you to maximize the speed of the burner and the capabilities that you choose to use. I have multiple burners, three to be exact, and I have used the virtual drives option.The photo editing seems very weak and I still use Photoshop instead.I have burned DVD's and made photo CD's without a problem. I have used the back up and I have had less coasters than using Nero Back It Up. The back up is even better when you realize that you do not have to close the DVD. That allows the same DVD to be able to add more data later.I just love the ability to use Drag 2 Disc which creates DVD's just like floppies.The biggest thing is that people should read the help files and unlike Nero it does not require a separate download."
1,Bug ridden and worthless,I have had nothing but problems with this flea-infested mutt. It is criminal that they released this thing when they did. Apparently it is all about making the holiday buying season regardless of quality. I will never buy another Roxio product.
1,What a waste of money,"This software is a waste of time, money and frustration. Despite the fact that I have a computer that is top of the line, it has shut down at least a dozen times while trying to use this product. The dvd I created ""re-created"" itself so I had to keep editing, re-editing (you get the idea).Forget the label making feature. It makes solid black labels, which take forever to scribe using the Light Scribe.There is no tech support to speak of (and if you ever do get a human voice, you have to pay for the privilege). I can't believe they have the nerve to put this product on the market."
1,Something to avoid!!,"Despite having a new computer, this software wouldn't load from either of two dvd drives, and had to be copied to the HD to load. Once installed, it won't burn dvds from either drive, it rips audio tracks at half the speed of older versions of the program, and when uninstalled left portions of the computer inoperative. If you have a problem, you must pay $35 to speak to someone about your troubles. Alternatively, you can send them an email, and then wait 24 hours for a response, write back, wait again, etc. They do have some techs available via chat, and if you are really patient you might get help. And then, they blame problems on your equipment, other software, drivers, etc.(though everything you have is current) even though all this stuff works fine with other software programs."
1,Amazon needs 0 stars for products like this.,"I won't belabor all of the faults of this program since so many others have pointed out that virtually nothing works properly in this suite. It is typical of much of the software coming out lately - rushed to market before being fully tested, trying to do too much and ending up doing nothing well. Roxio has no answers, just wants to blame hardware even if the same hardware works fine with similar programs. Every problem I had with this suite with errors, hangups, and overall performance do not exist with other programs I use on the same equipment. I really suggest that whatever your needs, find a program that does one thing well and doesn't require special resources that are not delineated in the products specified requirements. I don't recommend buying anything from this company."
1,it sucks,"roxio basic came on my new computer, but the audio cd's I burned would not play on my older boom box. I found this out after making 4 copies. It did play in my car tho. So I upgraded to suite 9 with all the features. I saw that it can make wav files, so maybe that would play in the older boom box. When I tried to copy an auido cd this time it said 25 hours estimated time remaining. Then it kept going up to 33hours then 60 hours. After 1/2 hour of waiting I canceled and started over. Everytime I did this the same thing happened. I tried communicating with Roxanne but there wasn't anything close to my problem. So i gave up, and I was gonna call them today. But after reading all the negative reviews I think I will forget about that and try to uninstall and reinstall first. I upgraded for 49.99 plus 16.99 for a backup cd. maybe my credit card will let me get a refund."
1,"Based on MyDVD 9, this product is awful","Just bought MyDVD 9 (the DVD creation module in Easy Media Creator). After installing it, uninstalling it, and reinstalling it, it still does not work. Will be returning to Amazon tomorrow. Read the other reviews. This is one of the worst pieces of software ever created."
2,Roxio Easy Media Creator Suite 9,This product has been very hard to install the security functions becomes a real fight. It keeps trying to install additional unwanted programs after I have tried them and uninstall them. As a Graduate student in Computer Science these guys do not make it easy on the user.
2,hard,"Roxio 6 was a lot easier than this one. I can't listen to CD's on it, I can't upload my pictures. This is very complicated. I you don't have must know how about computers, and if you don't, this is not the one for you."
1,"I wish Amazon had minus ratings, I would give -5",Installation was ok. Horrible issues :-hangs with no reason. Sometimes simple click on Browse to save. (My machine is new m8120m Quad processor.- Simple SVCD file size is 10 times larger than uLead or Adobe products which I tried.- Audio capture doesn't work at all. Support says your hardware doesn't support it.OkVideo wave - Video editing software in EMC 9 is worse than freebies in the market.I strongly recommend to stay away until they release some patches... 9.1 or so.I'm asking for refund... if they don;t then will dispute .Going to try Pinnacle Studio 11 and will post the review
1,Vista Users Beware!,"Many users are having numerous issues with this ""so-called"" Vista enabled release. I have a brand new HP dv9000 with Vista Ultimate x64 and Roxio 9 Basic bundled. The HP bundled version of Roxio works. I purchased the Deluxe suite via download from Roxio. It will not install correctly. If you do a search through Google and the Roxio user forums it is blamed on the OS maker and a ""patch"" is coming (by Roxio which belies the claim that another company is to blame). Of course, the validity of this is irrelevant - I bought the product today from the Roxio website which clearly stated that it was compatible with Vista (including Ultimate x64). This ""bug"" means that IS NOT true. And no information is given by Roxio or its official support channels. You have to browse through hours of people having the same Vista issues on the forums. I would strongly recommend not purchasing this until they get it TRULY Vista enabled. Luckily, I purchased on my Visa. BUYERS BEWARE."
3,Good movie,"MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS. DON'T READ IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE SPOILED.I was born and still live New Jersey. I also grew up going to Seaside. I just watched this movie and I really enjoyed it. I thought the acting was great and the characters were realistic. I was so glad it ended the way it did. Joe and Ashley's relationship was a mess. Having him willing to give up his dream job for her was INSANE. All I kept thinking when she was leaving was, ""get in your car and leave!""Overall, I think this is a great movie and I would purchase it if it eventually gets released on DVD.PS- I'm so glad I'm not in my 20's anymore and don't have to deal with the shore club scene anymore :)"
4,great blast from the past!!,Street racer has always been one of my favorite games I played it for hours with my brothers many years ago and just got a snes system recently and wanted it again. There are 8 characters to choose from all with their own strengths and weaknesses. My personal favorite mode is the unique soccer mode which is basically soccer with cars. Overall a very fun and nostalgic game for me
5,hauntingly irresistable,"I impulse-purchased this cd after a Baroque concert in Portland, OR, and it was probably one of the best purchases I've ever made.I can listen to this cd over and over and never get bored of the harmonies the two violes are able to achieve. I wish I had more music along the same lines.Think: rainy day, an empty house, and a meditative mood... the music on this cd completes the picture.You will not regret getting this cd."
1,Junk!!,"Haven't had a mouse in our home in over 6 years, but the day we left for vacation, we carried in a box of apples from the garage without any thought. When we got home 11 days later, we heard scratching at night & knew we had a mouse in the house. We bought the Tomcat traps at our local Target. For almost 2 weeks, we set the traps altering between peanut butter & cheese. Each morning, we'd wake up to find the peanut butter gone, but the trap still set. We tried setting it both ways (firm & sensitive), but it didn't matter.Before long, we saw a baby mouse running across the floor. Ughh! We went to Home Depot and bought the old fashioned Victor traps and eight mice were caught within 48 hours (2 adults & 6 baby mice). Anyhow, my advice is to skip the Tomcat traps and buy the Victor brand. The Victor brand actually works."
1,Waste of peanut butter,"These don't work! I even found one of these turned upside-down without having gone off! The mouse steals the peanut butter every time.I have tried every single configuration: putting the peanut butter in the bait cup, at the end of the lever paddle, and even squished it into the holes in the paddle. It takes too much force for it to snap probably because there is 1/8"" - 1/4"" of play in the lever before it snaps. To prove that these absolutely don't work, I very carefully eliminated the play in the trap and placed the bait in the hardest to reach part of the paddle. The bait was still stolen.I got these traps from Walgreens, but I had been using the Victor traps that look identical and don't need bait. Victor traps: 2 for 2, Tomcat: 0 for 8 settings.Victor M038 Easy Set Mouse Trap, 4-Pack"
1,Looks like these are the Tomcat ones - terrible,"I these traps were designed to be easy to set. And they work well for that. The problem is they don't actually catch mice - EVER. I have tried a little bait, a lot of bait, putting the bait under, over, I even tap the bait platform with a knife until is halfway depressed so it will spring easier. No luck. The only time I caught a mouse with these traps was when it accidentally walked into it. I could tell because its head was nowhere near the bait. All I have done with these traps is fed the mice I am trying to kill. Going to pitch them and get the Victor ones my parents used when I was a kid."
1,DON'T BUY THESE TRAPS,"Don't waste your money!!!!!! After trying unsuccessfully to find the old fashioned Victor mousetraps at Target, I purchased the Tom Cat mousetraps (twelve of them). I was a little skeptical since they were so easy to set, thinking the trigger would be too hard to set off. Sure enough, after two nights in the basement, I checked all twelve traps and every single one had ALL the peanut butter licked clean----and not ONE went off. Back to the old Victor brand...yes, they're harder to set, but they've got the hair trigger needed to do the job right."
2,Oreilly losing quality,"This book as has been said ""is a completely different book and not worthy of being called the second edition of such a good book"". Oreilly has dissapointed me for the first time, since most oreilly perl books are excellent value and of a high quality. Instead as in the first edition that covers a good range of advanced topics this book chooses some rare and obscure ones. This book is of little use to the programmer whom has ever picked up the cook book or perl programming by same publisher. Unfortunely for me I did not have the chance to see the book in person, or a truthful review."
1,Do not waste your money and save trees,"This book is utter trash, you will derive more benefit from reading Learning Perl (4th edition) and Programming Perl.This book offers nothing in terms of delving into the operational guts of Perl, its philosophy, its parser and guts in general.The first edition was far and away better, although Siriviam did not explain the concepts behind 'my' and 'local' in its proper origins. But that is irrelevent in terms of comparing the 2nd edition with the first. The 2nd edition is nothing more than Volume 2 to Learning Perl; if you want to become a proficient and professional Perl programmer do not waste your money on the 2nd edition. Get your hands on the first edition and hold on to it until a better alternative comes along."
2,A trashing of the first edition ..........,"This is a blatant misrepresentation of the excellent first edition of this book:Advanced Perl Programming. It's as if they published a 2nd edition of GoF Design Patterns but it was written by the Three Stooges and contained a rambling account of Moe, Larry, and Curly trying to implement an HTML parser. If fact that would have been a better book than this! Most of this book is filled with lists of parsing modules but with no coherent thread of discussion about how to use these modules to do anything besides trivial parsing of simple documents! The only reason this gets 2 stars is due to the very first chapter which is a decent discussion of ""advanced techniques"" such as introspection and a very brief discussion of perl internals. However after that you can use the rest of this atrocity to wipe your ass with......"
4,"Detailed, step-by-step instructions for filing a patent","""Patent It Yourself"" is well laid out and written. It gives enough history and background on the Patent system to help one become knowlegeable on a general level. The book leads the reader through all the logical steps of developing a design or utility patent. Many useful forms are included. Not all of the forms are for the Patent Office, for example there is a form for sharing of a patent among partners. The book has tons of detailed information with a fair index. It can be usefull as a reference for those who are using an attorney but want to be in the know."
5,excellent reading,I think it is a most helpful and comprehensive work. It will be an equalizer for the inventor without the deep pockets.
4,TMI,"This book has a ridiculous amount of information. I've almost read the entire book and while I do feel much more knowledgeable about the patent process, I will definitely have to go back and re-read large portions of it. I guess there's just too much for my little brain to absorb. I will probably look for something that explains things in a ""10 step process"" or something along those lines. This is basically the Bible of patenting and I probably just need the ""10 commandments""."
2,Tells you what to but not how to do it.,"Felt that the author said just enough for you to understand that this is a complecated process and you can not do it yourself. Gives general overview and legal requierments. I have read this book from cover to cover and many of my questions were not answered. You will understand the process, that about it. If you need to know that to do, then this book is for you. If you need to know how to do it then look somewhere else."
4,A good educational overview of the patent process,"Mr. Pressman's book is perhaps the best overview of what is involved in the writing and filing of a US patent application. The writing is clear and the facts, for the most part, accurate. If you are serious about getting a patent, you should read this book. Having said that, I believe that you should still hire yourself a professional patent attorney to file and prosecute your application before the Patent Office. There are just too many intricacies in patent law and in the patent process to think that you can know them all by reading a book. If securing a meaningful patent were that easy patent attorneys would be out of work. In short, be an educated consumer. Read the book, ask your attorney questions and be interactive in the process. You know your invention inside and out and your attorney knows the law inside and out. Together you will make a formidable team and secure a patent that will really protect your invention."
4,A good start,"This book helps you understand what goes into a patent application, especially for a relatively simple invention. Sheldon's looseleaf, How to Write a Patent Application, can serve as a more comprehensive tutorial for the very serious patent applicant."
4,Quirky Jazz,"These fourteen instrumentals are very jazzy, quirky with a lot of unexpected turns and phrases. It reminds me a lot of Larry Coryell. They are tight arrangements, mostly around 5 minutes long, without much jamming and noodling.I don't think I will grow to love this music the way I do Zappa's Hot Rats, but I do like it."
4,Great book for rhythmic ear training,"I used this in college and I've found it helpful again for teaching AP Music Theory. It's concise but it's also sequential, so I can use it to help my students practice particular concepts."
4,Good training book,"I started my rhythmic training 10 days ago. I do 1 chapter per day and review the ones I couldn't do well.Every time, I find some rhythms are difficult. But when you do it every day, you get familiar with the same rhythms and can follow much easier. I am happy to practice my rhythms with this book. Thank you!"
5,Barney World,"Shipped and arrived on time. No problems with DVD, I will recommend to family and friends for the little ones."
4,The Canoe Trip Mystery,"Despite warnings and threats from a woman named Angela, the Boxcar Children set out on a canoe trip with Aunt Jane and become involved in a case involving a mysterious riddle and a stolen coin collection. Can they find the culprit before they get away?"
1,A let down,"I tried to apply the lessons from the book, but with little success. I expected much more after reading the enthusiastic blurb from the publisher."
2,Good for Starters,"Some good pointers for those of us just starting out with Texas Hold'em. DVD is a nice extra. A lightweight book, but it can give some confidence to get started."
1,Quick Yes- Easy No,"I play Texas Hold'Em from time to time and the book here is fine for getting the rules across and having the reader ready to play right away. As for ""easy"", it would have you think there is a formula to win at what is at the root a game of luck. Kenny Rogers' ""The Gambler"" pretty much lays out the same advice you get here. And he makes good chicken too!"
1,Hold'em on to your cash!,"For the price Matt Marroon and Lou Krieger's books offer better value. They cover the beginning stages and then move on to the point when the player may want to raise the stakes. A much more comprehensive approach, while remaining relatively jargon-free. Myers also is, thankfully, free from jargon and mumbo jumbo, but his book is a bit superficial in my opinion."
4,Great tool - highly recommend,"This was the first ""how to"" book I could really sit down and absorb. I even took notes on specific details, something I did not feel was warranted with 2 other books. I like this author's style of writing, and was pleased with the broad range of topics he covered. I did not enjoy the DVD quite so much - the background music was distracting, and I was disappointed in how abruptly it seemed to end."
1,Disapointing,I read this book with hope that it would be better than the other beginner level poker books I read but it wasn't. The DVD was not helpful either. I enjoy playing Texas Holdem and I want to boost my winnings and this book isn't helping me enough.
1,"Conservative, Yes","I agree that the author is conservative. Maybe TOO conservative in fact. I found that following his tips made the game tedious. It is supposed to be about fun, and I got bored fast. In a friendly game, the pace should be brisk and taking some risks adds to the excitement."
4,Sound Advice for beginners.,"I bought this book after flipping through the pages of many beginner books. This one jumped out due to the fact it was written in plain English and had an excellent glossary for when Poker terms absolutely had to be used.The book assumes no prior knowledge of Poker and explains structure of hands clearly and simply. Myers describes a method to win at low-limit Poker that makes absolute sense. Reading the book you understand clearly his methodology, actually playing the game on the Internet you see in action what he explains in the book.I have played Myers' method for many hours now. When I stick rigidly to it I win, if I drift from the method I start to lose quickly.Take Myers' advice and play this method with the tables he describes and you will soon be raking in the pots. I look forward to a more advanced book from this author."
1,DVD Isn't Working,"I buy this book because it include DVD so it sounds like good deal. Other books don't have DVD. So I get this one, but DVD doesn't work in my machine. I took to friends house and it work ok, but not on mine, and I heard from other people that this is not unusal problem. I must return, but then same problems again next time. It is very frustrating! Book is good, but with no DVD, I would try other book. I try this for DVD, but not working."
2,interesting,"A lot of good points. I watch poker on TV, but that is high stake and as Myers says the playing and betting style is very different. I can't gamble yet but I do play with friends. Sometimes for gum or very small money. I think this book will help me a lot."
2,Common Sense,"For me, this book had nothing new. I play T.H. poker many times some wins and some losses. Authors ideas same as mine, but I don't write book maybe I should? :) For persons who doesn't know how play T.H, maybe is good book. For persons like me who plays already, then I think not important to use this book. Use brain is better :)"
1,"Won't hurt, but probably won't help much either","I was given this book recently by a friend who knows I am a Texas Hold 'Em afficionado. I must say that I am relieved that the author encourages the reader to keep bets small and modest. Nobody will be hurt badly if his advice doesn't yield results, and he is quick with disclaimers to that effect. At the same time, in low-stakes Texas Hold 'Em, there are just so many useful tips that can easily be found on any website, or you figure it out for yourself, as the author claims to have done. One of the thrills of low-stakes gambling is that with a modest pot, you can ""experiment"" with strategies and learn what works best without going home wearing a barrel like in the old cartoons. I suppose the book is good at explaining the rules of the game, but it didn't really teach me anything I didn't already know. [...]"
3,Taking a seat at the table,"You don't see many African folks at the tables. I must say I haven't been made to feel very welcome at these so-called ""friendly"" games, but I do want to play and take some of the white man's money, so this book looks like it will help me in that respect.The book makes it look easy, and I hope it will be. I look forward to trying out the system and taking home my pot.The writing is a little on the fancy pants side, but it's all good!"
3,Usefull guide 4 new pokerplayers,Im new 2 poker especailly Texas Holdum. This book was 4 me becuz I needed 2 learn fast. It has ez to understand writing and tips 4 new players. I hope I will win a lot since I read this book. If u see the DVD u can also get some good tips about poker. So I recommend this book becuz it makes it ez 4 u 2 play. Good luck!
3,Didn't really like it,"I couldn't get into Sister Secrets, I didn't really care for any of the characthers, the majority of them seemed stuck up too me. A lot of times i didn't know who was talking, some of the characthers never came to life. I probably would have liked it better if i was in to sororities, but i'm not. The only thing i really liked about this one is the friendship between Jennifer and Lisa."
4,Intriguing Story *S*,i have to agree that the story was complicated but when i had gotten close to the end...all the pieces started falling together...in so many ways this book was a mystery because if you had read the beginning of the story....jennifer had died in the car accident. she was a virgin throughout the whole story because she was only a child...she was naive because she was only a child...ok i know im confusing you but you really have to read this book and pick out the pieces to put the information together and realize what happened and how fate and love is brought together by all these sorority sisters and brothers.
4,A Must Read for Sorority Members,"Being a member of a Greek Lettered Organization, I found the book to be quite interesting because it touched on the bonds of friendship and Sisterhood despite the difference in the Organizations mentioned. I Also liked the use of the spirits and angels, this brought a Little mystique to the book. However, I did have a bit of a time trying to follow most of the characters and organizations in the book."
5,One of the best books I have ever read!,Sister Secrets is the first book I a long time that I have fought to put down. The characters and plot mesmorized me and I did not want the story to end.
4,Young and the Restless on a College Campus,"This book was like a soap opera on a college campus. It was hard to follow at some points because it jumped around alot. I ound myself flipping back and forth to keep the story line straight, but Ms. James was very descripitive and provided a great deal of detail in her writing.I would recommend this book to other people as well as her follow up book ""Beyond Our Mother's Footsteps""."
2,I feel the book lacked focus and depth.,"Unfortunately, I cannot agree with the majority of the reviews regarding Sister Secrets. The story line was promising, but the drama surrounding all of the characters was too complicated to follow. Some characters seemed unnecessary and others should have held a stronger presence in the book. Additionally, too much time was spent depicting the college/sorority issues. I don't regret reading this book, but mostly I was just thankful to have finished it. Furthermore, I just find it very distracting to read a book with such poor editing. I am hopeful that any future books by this author will be more concise and thought-provoking with ample plot/character development."
4,Fascinating story with fascinating characters,"Once I figured out the characters and who belonged to what sorority or fratnerity, I found the book intriguing and hated for the story to end. This book reminded me of my pledge days in college; it gave great detail to Black Greek life on a college campus. The sorority life had a positive influence on its member, especially in developing their character and grooming them to become productive and successful women. Amazing how the author had the character's lives to become entwined! I am looking forward to reading the sequel."
2,Very Hard To Follow,I think that this book was very hard to follow though it provided a lot of insight to the greek life on college campuses i think that it sometimes focused on the little things that did not matter or things that really did not tie into the story too well. Also the one major thing that drove me absolutely crazy about this book was how it went from one sorority to the next basically telling the same story over again which became really frustrating. Like the previous critic said I was just happy that I got through the whole book.
4,Left Me Breathless and Hungry for More,"I enjoyed the book as well. I received it as a Christmas present from a soror. This book represents the trials and tribulations of sisterhood and mother/daughterhood. I love how the characters were interwoven. This is a must for women, sisters, best friends, etc.I agree with all of those who said that there were too many characters and sometimes you do need to remember who was who.Overall this was ann exceptional book, now that I know there is a sequel will dive into it right away."
3,Too many things unexplained,"I agree with the other reviewers that it would have been better to use real greek letter organizations. As a member of a Sorority, I too found it difficult to follow the different greek-letter organizations. I also didn't care for the jumping back and forth between the Betas and the Kappas activities. Subtitles should have been given. The author also could have done a better job of explaining the controversies that occurred. A lot of assumptions and inferences had to be made regarding the characters."
1,Very disappointed,"I purchased the book in hopes to find some encouragement for my situation. The book unfortunately has a very male-sexist undertone which ruined my experience of reading the book. I feel that forgiveness needs to be an aspect when dealing with abuse situations and reading a healing book that bashes males was not getting me close to forgiveness. (I happened to find a great husband and I did not want my view of my husband to be tainted by a man hater.)The book is geared more towards women who have been raped and solely focuses female rape victims, with males being the offenders. This isn't always the case in reality and it was hard for me to not feel as though the writer was a rape victim herself and maybe didn't fully recover from her situation."
2,Cheap and Disappointing,This ice cream scooper looked so good in the picture that I bought it. When it arrived I found it to be very cheaply made - its made in China. The handle was already loose and the scooper was badly scratched and gouged. The metal is obviously soft and cheap. There are much better ice cream scoopers for less money
2,Not As Described,This scoop is made of plated pot-metal. Not stainless steel as described. Don't waste your money. The plating will blister and peel like so many others. How much chrome plating would you like with your ice cream? Look for the OXO Good Grips Solid Stainless Steel Ice Cream Scoop instead.
2,Handle separates and peels,"I purchased the ice cream scoop last year and am disappointed that it already needs to be replaced. It scoops fine and is comfortable to hold but the black part of the handle is separating from the metal. Also, layers of the black material are peeling off."
4,A BAILAR,"Unfortunaly I could only listen briefly to four songs. but from the little I heard I recommend this CD. Beat is solid and the singer is a definate sonero.....nice, and great to dance to Im sure."
1,DVD Ripoff like Blood Harvest,"I wish people reviewing films would mention picture quality, 'cause this DVD release gobbles like a turkey on speed.A straight transfer from a VCR tape - you can see the d#$% lines going through the pic near the beginning - the picture is fullscreen, absolutely unretouched (crappy, grainy, blurry), with whole parts of the the movie missing. The ""lotsa nudity"" scenes lose all effect if the picture quality is that of a $2 used VHS tape in the bin at your video rental shop.I realize this is hardly a classic film, but I think retail outfits like Amazon owe it to their customers to identify VCR-to-DVD rubbish like this before we waste our good money on it.Or maybe that's what I'm doing here.This refers to the DVD version."
1,Not Happy,"wouldnt know wot tis films like cos i never recived it!missing 2 films from an order of near 120 euoros.ive tryd emailing amazon,never goy me an answer.maby now i might get me some attention.never aegain.adriano bove."
5,Great plan!,"My sister got me into Dr. Platt as she is a patient of his. She has lost over 80 lbs in 16 months and was able to go off of her insulin for over a year after having used it for 20 years. She does not live in Palm Springs year round, but consults with Dr. Platt at least once per month on the phone on her progress. This is part of the initial fee she paid upon first seeing him. She also has more energy than ever before and swears by him and this kind of bio-identical hormone therapy. I have started it myself by just going to a free lecture given by a compound pharmacy in Kansas City and then having them make up a compound made specifically for me. I am less depressed and no longer seem to be gaining weight out of control as I was prior to all of this. My advice...get this book and do what it says!"
1,WHO IS NO NAME PERTH AMBOY,"WHO IS ""NO NAME"" from Perth Amboy who felt compelled to post 3 identical posts? He must be O.J. Simpson, or maybe he wrote this book. This is from another one of his posts of another book on the same subject: ""Nothing has happened since 1995 to contradict the jury's verdict. The whiney complaints about the verdict and jury system have ceased...."" Ooops! I just read his confession in another book...Ooops! Better place your faith in something a little more reliable."
1,Barely Worth Reading,"The only thing I derived from this book is confirmation that the jury made the right call. The prosecution did a terrible job.That being said, this author should hang his head in shame. The book is mostly innuendo, rumor and gossip....hardly the mark of respectable author. Chapter Nine, ""Conspiracies, Grand And Otherwise"" is purely speculation with virtually no factual information in it at all. Most of the points the author wishes to make cannot be verified by any other source. This man had a permanent seat at the trial. He attended nearly every session for the entire 18 months. It is hard to believe that this is the product of much thought on his part. I bought this book at the Dollar Tree Store. That's about what the book is worth.I have also read Marsha Clark's book as well as the book written by Chris Darden. These were also terrible. I'm sure there has to be good book on the Trial Of The Century, but I don't know where it is"
4,Feisty Heroine for a change,"I actually liked this story. The heroine was feisty and stood up for herself. She wasn't insecure or too prideful. No unnecessary emotional drama. When she fell pregnant as they always do (for somehow in romance novels, nobody seems to know that sex leads to babies), the heroine told the hero about it and when he acted like a jerk, she eventually told him she would leave him and go her own way... which shook the hero up. The hero was a minor jerk. He carried the baggage of having grown up with abandoned mommy issues which he unfairly took out on the heroine. Yet he had passion for her inspite of trying to remain emotionally disconnected. The interaction between both characters was never boring. This was an enjoyable read"
4,Lovely heroine,I enjoyed this story and thought it worked well. I don't agree with the other reviewer that the h wasn't strong enough. She'd always loved the H and took the opportunity to spend time with him and knew it probably wouldn't last. I think the H was really awful prior to his accident but it was the catalyst for him and he started to realise stuff about himself and began to change. A good read.
3,The heroine's an idiot,"The heroine's an idiot living in a fantasy world who doesn't consider the consequences of her actions. The relationship between the Roel and Hilary is more or less based on sex. I understand that it's a Harlequin, and there is a certain amount of suspension of belief involved, but the decisions Hilary makes, and the fact they she manages to convince herself they are for Roel's good, or at least not purely self serving, are unbelievably stupid."
3,Be aware of the size issue,"This was supposed to be a Christmas gift. Beautiful looking shoe. The site does warn that ""This shoe runs two sizes smaller than street shoe size."" So that's what we did. Following their recommendation we ordered the shoes two sizes larger. And guess what: the shoe was two sizes larger. So we had to make a return unfortunately and re-order at the young lady's actual shoe size.So the rating may not be fair at this point in terms of shoe performance, durability, likability, etc. It has to do more with Capezio's size warning. Just be aware based on our experience."
2,Not a Happy Dancer!,"I purchased these for my 14 yr old sons first year of tap class. He may have wore them for 10 classes and that's pushing it. The shoe is not flexibile but we can work with that - however during last Saturdays class a rivet popped out of his toe pad and began to scratch the very expensive dance floor at the dance studio. Price was great but remember folks you get what you pay for!So, now yet again we are on the search for men's tap shoes with are very hard to find! With his next class in 10 days - I'm at my wits end!"
3,Serves its purpose,Simply made but works well for starter tap dancers such as my son. He quit tap after a few months so the price was right considering.
1,Cheap Shoes,"I bought these shoes because I was just starting out in tap and didn't want to spend a fortune on something I wasn't sure I was going to stick with. The shoes are very comfortable. However, the tap came loose during my third class. The taps are riveted on, not screwed, so if they come loose they are no longer any good. I have since thrown the shoes away and bought a real pair ($50.00). If you are just starting out and don't want to waste a lot of money, this is a good buy."
2,There are many better options,"I've been tapdancing for years, and I bought these shoes because I found myself roped into doing a quick tap improv show while away from home, and away from my favorite tap shoes. They will get the job done, but I don't like them. The only thing they have going for them is a very low price, which is helpful if you're just testing the waters with tapdancing. But if you're just starting out and you have any measure of interest in the genre, I would recommend Bloch brand's entry-level shoes instead. they are a bit more expensive, but they have a better feeling to them."
3,Ed Koch Created Homelessness in New York,"before Ed and his buddy Reagan , may they both rot in Hell Homeless problem was a small manageable problem . Ed destroyed affordable housing for mostly poor low income men living in SRO to help his Real Eztate developers friends..Now his sicko Real Estate friends are going after people that dont even live in their buildings Me..along with Bloombergs help and blessingEd also got rid of the NYPD from investigating cases of illegal Aliens.. Never forget the good stuff politicans do is usually paid with really bad stuff.Ed also put innocnent spanish kids in Jail for allegedly raping some retarded banker idiot.He supported the patriot act and alot of other nasty stuff.."
5,Awesome,Great book! Exactly what I was looking for and easy to read. I will definitely get a ton of use out of this manual.
3,Needs more than 1 can,"Desided to frost half of my porch door, worked great.....until I ran out of it. Needed to buy a second can."
5,Beautiful for crafts,I used this on a craft project and it turned out amazing. The more applications you apply the less splotchy it becomes.
2,money wasted,This stuff created a huge mess. The minute the window begins to sweat the stuff drips and runs off of the window. And yes it was totally dry! It looks good for about a day. If you like dusting for a month after you spray this and if your window never ever ever sweats ...go for it. Otherwise buy something else.
2,Cheaper Than Glass Replacement,"This product will produce a frosted glass appearance that should work well for interior use. However, it breaks down rather quickly (days or weeks) in the presence of condensation. Hard objects will also scratch it, but the finish can be touched up. Warnings about using the product in a well ventilated area should be heeded. It the odor will dissipate completely, but the aerosol spray may leave a white powdery residue on surrounding objects (like dust)."
4,window film,product worked for me much cheapear than the filmthat cost 20.00 per window at the big box storejust follow the directions
2,Fare at best,Bought this to frost our bathroom door. I followed the directions to the letter and it still came out streeky. It also scratches very easaly. Don't know if I would do it again.
5,Keeps peepers at bay -- good security.,"I didn't want random passers-by able to see in my garage -- a double-coat of this stuff and I still have plenty of light, but you can't make anything out from the other side. So, I would call that great success!"
5,Great results,"Just used this on a bathroom window. I used it according to directions and it looks beautiful. I think the key to good results are to spray quickly across, side to side. If you stay on one spot for more than a second you will probably get streaks. I suggest using some type of face protection because it does have a strong odor and may cause some nose & throat irritation in sensitive individuals. Highly recommended!"
5,Very good taste also nice price!,"This is an excellent product, both tastey and priced right. It's difficult to find this product in regular local grocery stores, so I was thrilled to find it."
2,OK Read,This book just kinds of plods along. It kind of lulls you. I used it for bedtime reading and it was perfect. A lot of the action that turns out to be relevant happens off stage and you don't know about it until the very end. But that's fine it doesn't really detract from the humdrum story. The story (when it finally get around to it) is about wrapping up major international drug dealers protected by all kinds of corrupt Wash DC cops. That sounds real enough. That sounds interesting but the reality is in this book it is at best diverting. The orginal receipt was in the book as a bookmark. Someone paid $2.98 for it in the Crown Books (RIP) bargain bin in 1993. My wife got it as part of a box of books for $5 from our local library. At that price it was fine. Listen the author tried writing a couple of books 15-20 years ago and then dropped the idea. After finishing this I can see why. No one will ever read this review but what the hey. It can't hurt.
2,Not what I was expecting,"The audio cds are clear and easy to listen to. I thought that there would be more details about general microbiology. The audio cd's list the names of the viruses, bacteria,etc.. but no details about microbiology."
4,Great action!,"In this video, there are 2 stories. The first one"" Night of the Clones"" remind us a story in the comic book (Amazing spider-Man #149) in which we see a clone of Spider-Man vs Spider-Man. If you are a big fan of comic books and Spider-man, i suggest you this video although the Spider-man's video are hard to find."
3,Misleading picture WAS shown on the website.,"I like this drill, but the picture that was shown on the website showed several annular cutters and the twist bit drill chuck - when the package arrived none of these items were inside! Since then (a week or so later) the image has been updated, and a more comprehensive description has been entered on the website. I think that Amazon.com is great in many ways, but sometimes there is a shortage of information on the website, this is the first time that I feel that I have been let down."
5,my grand kids love this drill,we have an exposed moment frame in our 3 story home and i like setting this drill up in the over head position on the flange of the beam. the grand kids just love collecting the curly metal shavings on the ground. i also use this tool as a learning lesson on why it should be tied off (i will unplug the cord at any given time while the kids are in the over head position) and these 8 year olds learn fast. next week im going to break out the LN-25 and let them plug weld all those holes they drilled. they can use 232 or 211 i dont think it matters. i dont even think it should be shored up befor applying heat as we say in the trade just weld the damned thing. i just may look into safety glasses for the grand kids but for now they seem like more of a hastle finding a pair that can fit an 8 year old. really this is just a big toy.. allways remember to wash the coolent off your hands before eating.
3,not the product on the picture,i but this product but in the picture was one way and it came another way (with out the accesories)
1,WAY NOT A TRUE STORY,"I PERSONALLY KNEW Rip Riddle who never endorsed or authorized this book. If you want a purely fictional book, it will do."
4,Tom Brady Jerzee,I was satisfied in all area's except the size. It seems the sizes run a little small.
1,dissappointed,jersey was nice in appearance but I believe it was sized wrong .had to return it because it didn't fit
2,Just okay too.,"Not my favorite either. The best one of all that I ordered was ""Go,Exercise with the Teletubbies"". My 14 mo. old daughter imitates the exercise movements. Even my husband loves it.If you only buy one, get the ""Exercise"" DVD."
2,Ugh.,"I myself really hate the dvd but I did not purchase it for me, but my 13 month old son wont watch it either. Maybe he is too young."
3,Jewelry Display Stands,"This is a nice jewelry stand set, with an earring holder, bracelet holder, and necklace rack. I would say that the earring one is the best with the most practical use. The necklace holder presents the problem of not being able to really see the items hung on the backside. The bracelet holder is not as easy to use because instead of just hanging your jewelry, you have to remove the bars and slide bracelets on it and snap the bar back...more steps/work than I would like."
2,Oxford Portuguese-English dictionary,The book is a paperback cheaply printed and won't stand up to repeated use. A number of Portuguese words I tried to look up were not listed
2,"Outdated Brazilian Portuguese, British IPA pronunciation","Don't recommend this for your Brazilian students if you're an American ESL instructor (British IPA pronunciation notation, and it's well out of date). The binding on it isn't what a student looking to make serious usage out of a pocket dictionary needs."
3,Useful with previous knowledge.,"Boasting a large number of words most translation is made simple without the need for a thesaurus. In this realm it serves as a useful tool for translations from English to Portuguese and from written Portuguese to English. However, the book assumes that upon hearing the language you can spell the words and this is not always the case. This is not a phrase book so conversation is up to you. There are some helpful common verb conjugations, but due to a large number of exceptions in the language even this is also difficult to use."
5,80's era,there are about 10 songs and 10 different singers. to name some of them there are Taylor Dayne and Tina Turner. even Paula Abdul. this is not some thing that you need but still makes it easier to store the CD case.
3,violin bow,a nice inexpensive violin bow.a good purchase for that second or for a student bow.would recommend buying this.likes the red stick color.
5,Good Folders,"The folders are very nice.I wanted to create a customized folder for marketing purposes, and chose this folder because of its material, and it's look/feel. I purchased some embossing stuff: a heat gun, embossing dust, a rubber stamp, stamp pad. Because of the material, when I applied the heat the folders started to 'wave' and loose the structure. I have not embossed before, so I don't know about the characteristics of materials and how they are affected by embossing/heat application.The folders are still usable after heating them up. When they cool, they get a little better.I like the business card holder on the inside flap."
2,Very Hard To Follow And Understand But Crispin Glover Is Excellent,This movie was really wacky and horrific and hard to follow and comprehend but I was intrigued by Crispin Glover's performance as a magical gory magician. But the story and plot just really threw me off. I just didn't really understand this movie at all. But I just enjoyed watching the performances of Crispin and Kip Pardue. Guess that's all I can say about this one. LOL!
1,What a disappointment.,"I totally love the original Wizard of Gore. Herschel Gordon Lewis's classic is nothing short of hilarious! The first time I saw it, in the 80s, I was shocked and horrified. But after another viewing I saw the zany humour in it!I so wanted to love this remake. I was soooooooo excited when I ordered it. But unfortunately it was a total let down. I was so bored I couldn't even watch the whole thing. I tried a couple times to watch it, and eventually gave it away. This new Wizard of Gore just don't cut it."
1,What is this?,Very very hard to follow. I didn't understand who the main character was. What was in the brown bag? The comparison to the original is very weak. The effects were better in the newer verson but at least in the original a grade school child could understand it. Didn't like it at all.
4,A Labyrinthine Trail Of Insanity,"While I have yet to see Herschell Gordon Lewis' original, I was fairly impressed with this horror remake. Crispin Glover was amusing in the role of Montag the Magnificent, and his monologues with his unsuspecting audience made gave me goosebumps. This film keeps you constantly guessing what comes next in it's downward spiral of insanity. I highly recommend it."
3,"Shoe good, but back strap loose","This is a beautiful shoe, but the strap around the back of the foot was too loose. It would be better if the strap were smaller, perhaps with more elastic for those whose feet need it."
5,Excellent,"I have been a small business owner for many years, and I am always looking for ideas. I read at least one business/e-commerce/retailing book each week with a post it flag dispenser handy. This book was dull, and was hard to read... many business books are... they're not fiction after all. But I had dozens of flags in the book when I was done, meaning dozens of practical ideas that I feel I can apply and make money with.If reading dry business stuff is a challenge, I sympathize with you but ask... where are you getting your new ideas on growing your business from?"
1,YUK,"This book was pretty awful. CONSTANT reiteration of simple topics, beaten to death, like 'providing excellent quality to customers' and then if that weren't bad enough it follows with two examples 'Bright Spot Laundry decided ''. I couldn't even finish 100 pages. It felt like the author was just trying to fill pages. Don't waste your money."
2,Extremely high postage,"I purchased 2 one pound jar of zinc oxide. The label was not helpful as to the percentage of the zinc oxide. When I read my invoice the postage (standard shipping) was more than doubled for what the ointment cost. I will not order again.SD Wilson, NY"
3,Needs more zinc,"The zinc oxide is only 20 percent in this, so it's not very effective for diaper rash. Desitin or store brands at the same percentage (40) is a much better purchase."
5,used for pigs,Just to brighten your day I bought a lot of this product to be used at a pig sanctuary - the ironwood pig sanctuary - this is the product they recommend for price and quality. I didn't realize that pigs get sunburned - so do a good deed and buy more and send to them. kcr
3,60's rock'nroll,I have mixed feelings regarding the recordings by the original artists. These are not the versions that became hits. It's nice to hear different ways of doing the original hit songs/music but it's not what I was expecting.
5,Great Folders,These folders were very inexpensive and met the requirements of having pockets and Acco fastners to hold the 3=hole papers I used for a presentation. Very good quality and even greater value.
2,For the guitar players & die hards only,"Being a TVZ fan and hack guitar player, I thought this would be perfect for me. On the latter front, it is interesting to see his finger positions as was pointed out by another reviewer, but as a TVZ fan this is disappointing. It is just Townes on a couch with a couple cameras which in and of itself would be fine except the sound is kind of funky. I know ""funky"" is not much of a description but it definitely is not a DVD I would crank thru the stereo. I like TVZ alot, but I would suggest the Heartworn Highways (which I have) or one of the items on his official website (which I don't have) before this item.Troy"
3,More a fan item,"True this DVD is a rare chance to see Townes playing live. Apart from the DVD ""Townes live in Amsterdam"", you can order it via Townes' official website, there is, by my know, no other visual document released. Townes plays a set in a hotel room in Houstan. He plays a well chosen setlist with a few gems, Nothing, I'll be here in the morning, Pancho&Lefty.; Also interesting is the addition of Barb Donovan, playing ""Come Tomorrow"" and Calvin Russel playing ""Mister Mud and Mister Gold"". So far with the good things, a big letdown is in my opinion the quality of the footage of Townes, both in sound and picture. The picture is blurry and somewhat colourless and the sound is distracted by minor hiss.Townes seems also a bit tired and being in a sad mood (When compared to ""Hartworn Highways""). If you are a fan you're not disapointed but if you are a Townes ""first timer"" by ""Heartworn Highways"" instead."
5,pure genius,made in the shade is an excellent stones compilation.ignore the previous retard who needs to be banned from amazon.
4,More Stupid Cover Art for A Quality Film,"The marketing execs who approve the cover art of these South Korean DVD releases should be shot. Wide Awake (aka The Return) is not a cheap slasher as the cover depicts.On the contrary, it's a very entertaining thriller with a lead antagonist who suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder after experiencing anesthetic awareness during a childhood surgury. This is chock-full of originality because the killer uses exotic medical tactics to dispatch his victims. The orchestration behind one particular murder is magnificent, going down as an instant classic in cinema. However, the final half hour drops the ball a bit with an unoriginal, cliched climax and a few too many twists that take the already stretched realism and throw it out the window. A better ending would have made this film critic-proof, but in its current state it still packs quite a punch.Do yourself a favor and see this. It's quality entertainment."
3,"Overpriced, overpriced, overpriced, but info helpful in many ways.",The book was way too expensive but had some good information. Not written by a professional and had too much personal experience as exposed to actual studies but was heartfelt and made some excellent points. I got if thru AMazon.com
4,Marvin and the Mean Words,This book is about a boy named Marvin who forgot his coat in the school but when he goes back to school he sees his teacher Mrs. Bird. He thinks that she is talking about him but she is actually talking about another boy named Joe Marvin. Marvin becomes angry and decides to hate her.She said she wants Joe Marvin to leave because his bad temper is making the team loose.I like this book because it's talking about bad feeling and how to solve them.
4,funky punky hair's a mess,"My daughter, 2, loves this doll but the only problem with her is her hair. It's unlike ""Barbie"" hair and gets greasy feeling and weirdly tangled the minute you start playing with it. And that hair will last forever. Otherwise, she is excellent. Fun for girls who like unconventional dolls."
3,Arms and legs are not bendable,"I ordered this doll a couple of months ago for my niece for Christmas and just opened the box so we could wrap it. The arms and legs have no wire in them, so are not bendable! I ordered 2 dolls at the same time and the other one is bendable. I am a bit disappointed, but guess I should have inspected them right away."
1,Crapped out after just a few months,"Bought these for an old rig that I was spiffing up for my wife.. wish I would've read a few more reviews on other sites about these fans.. but since they were ANTEC I figured they were good stuff. The first one maybe ran for 2-3 months then the bearings wore out. The 2nd one lasted a little longer, same thing. I put the 3rd one in that I had bought (I bought an extra one just in case) and that one is still running for now, but on full speed it seems like it's running really slow.. so I imagine it's just a matter of time before that one quits."
5,I buy Antec whenever I can and they always deliver,"The green LEDs on these fans go so well with the blue LEDS on the big boy 200mm fan on the top of my Antec gaming case and the blue at the rear as well. I mounted 3 of them, two at the front for intake (clean filter regularly as they suck a lot of air in and dust gathers quickly) and one on the side for intake as well."
4,MOURNFUL THOUGHTS AND MELANCHOLIC HORIZONS,"I'm paraguayan and in my country there is no snow, but when a read Korolenko i think he create a new world in a mind of human being. Painting sadness, fear and loneliness, he gave to you hope and strenght to live and fight adversity. this and the blind musician are their best pieces."
5,MST3K Never Disappoints,I am a long time fan of Mystery Science Theater 3K and just love having it so available. My only complaint is that they no longer make it.
1,Don't buy this crap!!!,I bought this set for Zombie Nightmare and was sorely disappointed. They cut most of the scenes where the zombie actually kills someone. What is this for kindergarteners. They should be ashamed of themselves for selling this crap. I since ordered the real version of this movie without those stupid comments. Every time I heard one of their stupid remarks I wanted to go bash them in the head with a bat like the zombie in the movie. If you pay the price they want for this now and trust me I didn't pay anywhere near these prices you are stupid. I'm selling this hunk of crap as soon as I can and if I can't I might use it for batting practice. I would give it 0 stars if possible. I am a true horror fan and I don't care how bad a horror movie is it doesn't deserve this kind of treatment.
2,TV Screen will die,"We bought ours about 5 months ago and thought it was great up until this past week. Went to turn it on a few days ago and the sound was working, but the screen was blank. I started looking online and found that other people were having the same problem. It's not worth $100 for 5 months worth of use."
2,"good at the start, tv died after warrenty ran out.","Bought the unit in October so that we wouldn't miss football action while cooking. Started out great, good tv reception after attatching outside antenna, good radio reception. It's now February and the the TV keeps disappearing and going blank on us."
1,Good for 90 days,It is good for the first 90 days then the screen goes (less than a week actually). Since the place i got it from (Walmart) can't give your money back after 90 days and they only sell it during Christmas I had to send it back to GPX.GPX told me to send it back even though it was past the 90 day warranty with out any questions. This tells me they have had a lot of problems with this unit.
2,john,"not enough instruction on the remote.....lots of functions....but they dont work the TV....you have to reset the color, contrast every time I change channels.....as far as the radio and CD plyer they are okay......"
2,"Good while it lasted, dies after a few months","This was not a horrible product. I purchased it relatively cheaply. And for the price I got what it was worth. Picture quality was mediocre, sound was ok. FM reception was good, but AM was non existent.It was decent as a second or third TV. For having something on in the kitchen while cooking dinner or doing housework, it did the trick.But only after 4 months or so it died. Stopped working entirely, so because of that I cannot reccomend this product to others. Beware!!"
1,Has to upgrade to be garbage,"Scratch this off your list for concideration. it's Junk. Functions marginal, screen goes black. remote does'nt work. Last GPX unit I'll ever concider. I'll go with-out first."
5,Excelent DVD recorder for Mac,I use this unit with a 300 MHz beige G3 Mac and it works like a charm with MacOS 10.2.8. No problem at all with Toast or other software.
5,TOP NOTCH EXTERNAL DRIVE,A VERY EASY SETUP TOOK MAYBE 5 MIN.TO SET UP LOAD SOFTWARE AND PLAY A DVD . HAVE NOT BURNED ANY CD'S OR DVD'S YET SO I CAN'T SAY HOW FAST OR QUIET THE DRIVE IS BUT IT WAS QUIET DURING DVD PLAY.PLUS A GREAT PRICE AND SERVICE FROM TIGER DIRECT.
1,Not a lot of help...,"The Playboy Mansion hint book was not very helpful to me. Here is why. Much of the book is on story mode. While I found it helpful in explaining how the game works, the free style section was tiny when compared to the chapters on how the missions work. But I don't play story mode. So, while parts were helpful, the book didn't help me improve my games. Much of it was easy to figure out just by diving into the game.Also, I have heard many of the missions of the story mode are impossible to play - which means, if correct, story mode only goes so far before becoming a dead end."
4,Calm,"Certainly, this is about individual style. It is that character which pervades Mr. Faudree's work. We all take from our cache of knowledge, and Mr. Faudree has chosen from French, Spanish, and English styles.I don't see more clutter than in English Country or French opulence. I do think the rooms appear a bit too ""clean"" -- not lived it. I believe the photographer is the problem and not Mr. Faudree. That said, with my collection of over two hundred interior design books, from Billy Baldwin to Faudree, this deserves its place on the shelves along with the rest."
1,An expensive disappointment!,"I've admired Mr.Faudree's work in Traditional Home magazine and just knew I would love the book. Unfortunately, most of it was a rehash of photos and text I'd seen before. The rest was dull and tired. If you are looking for something fresh and authentic, this isn't the book for you."
1,This is phony French,"Maybe I'm a snob because I'm from Missouri which has such deep French roots. Maybe it's because my family is French and we've travelled to France many times. But the rooms in this book are phony French. I suppose Charles Faudre, whoever he is, doesn't know any better, but he should have called this book Nouveau (riche) French or French for Dummies. The rooms are pretty enough but they're too ""done,"" too planned, too busy, and too precious to be anything like the real thing."
2,"I just got my copy, and I am very displeased with it","I am displeased with this book because it doesn't seem to be ""au courant"" in how it portrays French Country style. French Fussy would be more like it or Suburban French. The rooms are too full, formal, sweet, and busy to convey the relaxing ease of true Country French style. This is like old Country English which someone has tried to say is French. I also agree with the reader who said it looks like the 1980s. Yuppie French? Oui."
2,I love French but I don't love this,"I love French style but I don't love this book. I think Mr. Faudri has his French and English mixed up. I think the rooms look like an odd mix of breeds. I also don't care for the fact that the rooms pictured in the book have a terrible amount off furniture and accessories in them. It's too much and the result doesn't look authentic but self-conscious, in my opinion."
1,Doesn't grab my soul,"I adore all things French so I am puzzling over my response to this book. I don't like it. It doesn't grab my soul the way real French style does. This book misses the mark by a mile. Of course, isn't this designer from Tulsa? (Oh, sure! That's where I go for decorating ideas.) Come on!"
3,Large glasses keep breaking,"These glasses look great and are easy to hold and drink out of. However, 4 out of the 8 tall glasses have broken in our dishwasher, all in the same place and the same way. It may be a production defect. We have been especially careful with them since 2 broke, and still 2 more have broken. None of the small ones have broken."
5,Great glasses!,"These glasses are strong, durable, and have a very unique design. I ordered a set that came and a few glasses in the box were broke,(most likely due to improper handling during shipping). However, I notified amazon and they immediately sent me a new box that were perfect! I did not have to return the broken glasses due to the risk of harm to others so I actually got 2 cases (minus a few) for the price of one!"
1,Extremely fragile,"My sister bought these glasses for me for Christmas. When I got them, I liked the style. However, it's now the end of March and in the past 3 months, 3 of the 8 tall glasses have broken. I live in an apartment that doesn't have a dishwasher, so I hand wash everything. I believe that if there is the slightest amount of pressure on the glass from anything else in the drying rack, the glass will crack."
4,good value,"My now 6 year-old son cut- and -pasted from a catalog his entire Christmas list from the Thomas Take Along collection! This bag of track is a very practical accessory that allows much more flexibility to the system AND he can do layouts all by himself. The only frustration is that the Take Alongs are NOT compatable with any of the other Thomas stuff-- wooden, interactive , or battery-powered (which we have alot of)."
3,Black & Decker Brain Fart,"Length:: 0:15 MinsThe Bright Bar makes a single bright spot and you must constantly reposition it to see your work. If you hang it by the hook, wouldn't you expect it to kind of light up the area? Nope. It projects a spot on the wall. On the bright side, it is nice and bright and tough and water-resistant. But I plan to return it. The ""Bright Bar 360"" seems like it would work 100 times better for me."
1,Dead on arrival,"Must be something wrong with the battery pack, charger puts out but the battery will not charge. Black and Decker states I will have to send it to a repair service center."
1,does not work,This item was a gift and it did not work out of the box.I returned it to Black and Decker and never got anything back. I called them and never got a call back. Bad item don't buy one.
5,Super light for the price !,"This looked like a great light in the package and it didn't disappoint. I have had the ""bright bar"" for over 5 years and still no signs of rechargeable battery failure.Plus, unlike alot of rechargeables this battery keeps its charge for MONTHS without a recharge if only used for 10-30 minutes at a time here or there. I only plug thelight in about 3-4 times a year and let it run down thru use but honestly it sometimes sits on a shelf for months (and not on the charger) with no use and when I pick it up,turn it on, the light is just as bright as when it comes off the charger. No idea of how many hours of continuous use would cause it to go dim because I typically only use it forat most 1/2 hour at a time but for my buck it was a fantastic deal."
2,Bad battery design,This is the perfect gift for the garage nut. This makes working on your car a lot better. I would recommend this to anyone. Battery ended up dying. You can't leave it plugged in. Company said to unplug when charged. How do I keep track of its charged status if I don't use all the time.
1,Goes dim too fast!!!,"A co-worker of mine owns an older version of this light. I really liked it so I decided a year later to buy one for myself. Obviously, there were many changes in manufacturing between the times he purchased his and when I purchased mine. When I start using the light, it starts out bright (although not as bright as my co-worker's) and after only a few minutes of use, the light gets real dim. After 15 to 20 minutes I am unable to use it at all. At first I thought it was the battery running low, but now I believe it's the L.E.D. bulbs themselves over heating and dimming out. The plug connector on the charger is different between the two versions of this light, which may or may not have anything to do with it. It may be an isolated incident with my light, but by the time I figured out what the problem might be, I am way past the warranty timeline. Do yourself a favor....save your money and DO NOT purchase this light."
1,Just bad!,This product is just bad. I was fixing an A/C in a 4x4x5 air box and it would not even provide workable light. Don't waste your money!
2,Dim,"Wonderful product BUT it's not very bright. I have a corded fluorescent version that is a workhorse - quite possibly the best $20 I've ever spent on a tool. Unfortunately it has a heavy cord and therefore not as agile a device. The black and decker device, on the other hand, is ineffectual as a lighting apparatus. I can't imagine using it to change a tire in the middle of the night. I'm disappointed"
2,Very poor product,"Others have it dead on. This light will not hold a charge for anything -- so short in fact I consider it useless on battery. It is highly directional and a very dumb design since it was obviously supposed to be an area light, NOT a flashlight. B&D should recall this piece of junk and issue either a redesigned, i.e., functional area light, OR issue credit. Very disappointing B&D product that should have never left the test area."
2,It;s not the best,I think the album was okay its not the type of spanish reggae i was looking for but other people may like it. It had some good beats and i just hop you will enjoy it.
3,"Nice, but smaller than advertised","This plank looks good, but it is only 7 x 17, not the 10.5 x 17 size listed in the description. I need the larger size, so back it goes."
3,How I praise you review,"Although I think the idea behind this book is a noble one, I found many of the songs to be too simplistic and at times too disjointed for the songs to be memorable. Some of the songs stop so suddenly, you wonder where the rest of the music is. Again, an admirable attempt, but lacking in the musical department."
4,Great for the money! Low cost way to convert that old ten speed to a single speed.,"You always get what you pay for, but I am very happy with this crank set. The chainring face looks a little more solid than shown in the photo, but for $20 I can't complain. Also, the chainring is one piece (it doesn't attach to the crank arm with five little bolts like you normally see). I think the machining on the left crank arm socket is a little out of whack because it won't go as far on to the left square taper bolt on the bottom bracket as the my previous crank set. If you get the nut tight, then you shouldn't have any problems.You're not getting a Campy crank set, but for the money this is a great way to make that old ten speed into a single speed or fixed gear. I also bought a 16t freewheel."
2,dissapointed,"The left crank is completely out of whack i had to spend some time fileing the hole lager so it would fit.. it works but but felt stupid after seeing a way better crank at my local bike shop for $15 no shipping.. suggest you go to your local bike shop and tell them your looking cheap.. too much to make this one work and its not that high of quality not worth the wait time, labor time to make it fit, and price.. probably worth $10, maybe."
2,Was cheap even for the cheap price,"I bought this to install on a cruiser so I could get it going while I replace it with a proper crankset, well this lasted three weeks when the sprocket seperated from the crank arm, even for being less than 30bucks shipped it was cheaply made."
3,cheap crankset gets job done with no frills,"The crankset works fine. When I was installing it, my son knocked the chainring side off the bottom bracket onto the ground. Just falling that foot and a half bent the chain ring. I was able to bend it back, but was surprised at the lack of toughness. I guess for the price, what was I expecting?Installed, the crankset works fine. Was able to install without any trouble and it is staying tight."
3,It's okay,As I read the book the comments by Pema got shorter and more generic. I like what she had to say and found it informative.
3,Not so Pithy,"I have always liked Pema Chodron's short easy-to-read essays.This book is fatter than any of her books. The chapters areuncharacteristically lengthy. I have not read the whole book,but I will probably spot read it. An interesting feature is thepoems included in each chapter. They are surprisingly differentto Pema's work. I'm not sure if I like this feature or not. Iam a Pema Chodron fan, however, and her books have always givenme solace in this difficult world. ""No Time to Lose"" is worthreading -- the title, at least, is like a gentle whip to ourflaccid brains."
1,No Time to Lose: A Timely Guide to the Way of the Bodhisattva,It was not what I had expected. I found it somewhat confusing and hard to understand.
1,Cheap stainless steel bulletin board,"I received this - all bent out of shape, not even flat. There's no mounting hardware or anything. Just a cheap piece of badly finished stainless steel..."
5,Nice Stainless Steel Board,I got my board in great shape and ready to install out of the box. I have it in the kitchen holding up my spice tins well. I like the brush stainless look.
3,Pat of another book,"It is a part of a bigger book "" All Things Great and Wonderful"" so it is cheaper to buy any book titled "" All things ..."""
1,Vet in Harness,"BEWARE, I purchased this series thinking they were a continuation of James Heriot's first four but to my disapointment the publisher riped off the public by reprinted the original stories under a new title. I tryed to return them but gave up and donated them to the local library"
5,Amazing,"This book, and the entire series, is awesome! And just so everyone understands, the books in THIS series are the originals. Each of the All Things books are two of these books put togetther. Just read The Real James Herriot: A Memior of My Father by Jim Wight.The Real James Herriot: A Memoir of My Father"
1,Printing Stinks!,"Don't buy this book! The ink is set on poor paper and it therefore is BLURRED! You will go blind trying to read it. I refuse to even try. Please check this out with others if you wish but seriously, it is not readable. I can only imagine that they went on the cheap paper and the ink is not set up right. HONEST! Save your money."
1,rock n roll dance party,orignal artist not orignal recording-most songs re-recorded don't waste your time or money
3,Perhaps the poorest of Sophocles' plays.,"In this play, considered by many critics to be the poorest of the seven extant plays of Sophocles (the speaches are too long and the development of the play is awkward), the wife of Heracles, Deianira, unknowingly sends a poisoned robe to her husband who has finally completed his labors. She is also concerned that she has allowed a rival for the affections of her husband to enter her household. Hercules has sent the captive Iole to Deianira. As Hercules lies dying, he orders his son Hyllus to marry Iole. Does Hercules truly love Iole? Even when dying, he is concerned for her future."
2,Emits a Strange Odor,The plank works well for cooking but after 1st use I had to store it in the garage due to a the smell. It's not a natural cedar odor - I think it's treated with chemicals to give it a cedar smell. I think it would be fine without this.
5,Epic black metal from Poland,"A very impressive black metal release. This cd has four tracks, and two of them are instrumentals. The songs are very epic-sounding and provide images of armor-clad soldiers on foreign shores. A must have for fans of epic music. Pagans and Satanists alike should enjoy this cd, for Graveland is strongly anti-christian(as is most black metal)."
2,An adjustment that fell short,"At the time of this album, the band was looking for new ways of making an epic sound and, basing their assessment perhaps on black metal listeners who simultaneously chanted ""simpler, rawer"" and ""more keyboards,"" Graveland cut an album of long, repetition, loosely layered songs that seems hasty in both vision and product. It is an admirable attempt, and there is good stuff on here, but the density is not there, and thus intensity is sparse enough to fail to keep the interest of an alert listener. Please, do not ruin yourself as a Graveland fan, buy this one last; in the meantime, ""The Celtic Winter"" is probably the experience you seek."
5,Fantastic!,"I was very satisfied!This product works!Finally I can play my drum without any problems.So,if you live in an apartment,this would help a lot."
3,WrestleDude's Top 11 matches that didn't make it to this set,"11. The Flying Evises vs. AJ Styles,Low-Ki & Jerry Lynn 6 man tag team match(June 19,2002)10.

Every Ultimate X match that took place at the TNA Asylum.Overall,I still think the matches on the dvds are great and it's still a pretty good set for any TNA fan. I give this set a 6 out of 10."
2,SNORE--it's just not all that,"I'm big on little daily doses of inspiration and motivation, so I was surprised at my lukewarm-to-negative reaction to this calendar. Elements of the art and sayings are quite repetitive, really; which dilutes their impact. And, as fun as the idea may be in theory, I just haven't had time to break out the colored pencils to color my own (the weekend entries aren't pre-colored). Disappointing."
2,screwjob,"I'm normally good about reading customer reviews, but I somehow missed this one. I knew something was up the first time I listened to this, and questioned that these were the same versions I heard on the radio...now I know this is not true, and I have to pursue a different, legit compiliation. Too bad, because these songs are fantastic and the backing tracks really rocked and took them to another level...just not on here. Admirable knockoffs but not the real thing. The vocals were the clear givaway: none of the power and desperation of the originals. STEER CLEAR!!!"
2,Warning to radio listeners,"Warning to radio listeners and fans of TJ & S from the60s: This collection is not the original or familiar ""hits"" that you heard on the radio. If you desire to hear these, youwill be more satisfied with another collection. On a positivenote, if you are a collector, this is another version of the group's greatest hits."
3,Okay,"The songs were good, but the re-recording was not done very well. Should have spent more bucks for the remastered original recordings."
1,Wrong picture,Beware - the picture is not the correct one. The picture shows a HDMI-F <-> DVI-M but the item you will receive is a HDMI-M <-> DVI-F
2,The Truth as I see It,"I was surprised to see only good reviews, so I feel I owe it to those that are reading the reviews to get my take. This album definitly hasn't grown on me yet. I have all of Fred's Albums and this is his worst. If you don't own any albums, do not buy this first...it is definitly not a musicians favorite album of Fred's either. Generally his music is full of Willie Bennett and cool fills and fast driving train tunes and farm losin' music, but this is like the soundtrack to a funeral. Nothing more boring than listening to keyboard drums.Maybe the day will come when I like it too, not today though...and I feel I wasted 20$ on this album??One bright spot is Codeine. If you see the song LIVE though and are expecting a similar version on the CD...don't buy this album...its a completely different version."
2,Dusty doesn't sparkle,"I have more cd's of him, and this one is not on top of the pile; bit too slow and doesn't hold my interest. Not bad but not great either."
1,math & science made easy,"""High achievers from traditional classrooms ... are accustomed to being rewarded for quick answers with low levels of thinking.""With this slick speculation, Adams and Hamm give up the game. Their purpose in writingCollaborative Inquiry in Science, Math, and Technologyhas nothing to do with making science and math more meaningful for elementary school students. The goal is to enforce politically correct outcomes by dumbing down the curriculum. Period.Buy this book if you want suggestions for superficial feel-good exercises that require minimal teacher preparation and entail no student frustration (except for the few students who come possessed of real curiosity and analytical interest)."
2,All New Stereo Re-records,"As not to pay royalties for the old original songs they (Dominion Entertainment) paid some old dog to come back and have them try and howl again.These efforts never seem to pay off for the listener and you're stuck with another collection of songs without energy or snap. Pay for the originals and honor their efforts and memories. After 40 years, none of us can go back to to being 19 again."
4,Tangy-rich citrus flavor!,"This is one of the more sucessful of Celestial Seasonings Zinger genre. In this case the flavor of rose hips and hibiscus does not overpower the other flavors (unless you brew longer than 4 minutes). The aroma of this ruby potion is deliciously citrus and full bodied. The flavor of the tea is sweet red grapefruit and orange. Very tasty! I imagine this would make an excellent ice tea. Also, it is caffeine free and has added vitamin C--45 mg.Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface.Quote from the box:""Be in readiness for favorable winds."" Chinese Proverb."
1,Too Much Zinger and Not Enough Orange,"Usually I am very pleased with the ratings on things in Amazon. Maybe it was the set of boxes I got, but I can taste no orange in the orange zinger tea. We only can taste the spices. Very disappointing."
5,Best of the Zingers!,"The past six months I've been trying out all the zinger teas available on Amazon.com (after learning about the high antioxidant content of Hibiscus teas). I use them as an iced tea by putting several in a pitcher of water and putting it in the fridge (steeps just fine in cold water overnight) Anyway, out of all the varieties this one is my favorite - by far! even my three-year-olds love it since it's reminiscent of juice, with its citrusy flavor. I think it would aslo be a great beverage with a little sweetener, but still delicious plain."
4,"If you are a Brooke White fan, you will love this movie!",I have been a big fan of Brooke White since Season 7 of American Idol. I bought this movie that stars Brooke. Cute movie!
1,Go Hog Wild,"My-Music you sent me the wrong DVD I ask for Go Hog Wild and I have received Being Erica Box set#4 insted I'am not dealing with your company any more, your just as bad as Pbshopus company there order # messed up to. you have the number's for your DVD's ALL MESS UP! I hope you fIX this, your loseing CUSTOMER's, GO HOG WILD is funny movie to bad I won't SEE. IT YOUR ORDER #'s ARE MESS UP! KEITH G. CURRY"
2,Not Impressed,"Oh, how this reviewer wanted to like this book. But, unfortunately, the whole reassembled concept of poor little poor then rich girl is scarcely inviting, due to the trite treatment this new Judith Michael (after the highly enjoyable DECEPTIONS) offering gets. Don't get yours truly wrong, the elements are all there: a beautiful heroine, a dashing hero, luscious settings and a jet-set life worthy of any rich-layered typical novels, but the overall delivery just doesn't cut it. Little do you end up getting involved with the characters and the cookie-cutter plot. The elements are so clearly evident you'll rightly guess the outcomes pages before they happen. Though the narrative is as impressive as ever the book in the end is not.-----Martin Boucher"
5,Highly recommended,"Twenty something years ago, I read all the books by these writers. Reading this one again brought back a lot of memories and loved it even more. I am very happy I could get it through Amazon."
5,I love this thing!,"I was looking for a way to remotely control my media server. I found this item on Amazon. I installed the software, plugged in the USB receiver, picked my music player from the pull down list, (Winamp), and within seconds I was controlling my computers music system. Totally awesome!"
3,Laptop audio remote control,"For some reason this remote keeps running out of battery. Not sure what the problem is, but although we turn it off after use, and we only use it twice a week for a few hours, every couple of weeks the battery is dead. Anybody has any ideas?"
3,Dommage qu'il n'y ait pas compatibilité avec le 64 bits,"Bon produit mais qui ne marche pas sous 64 bits, ce qui est fort dommage.Une solution: installer une version 32 bits (seven 32 bits par exemple) en dual boot sur laquelle on utilisera la télécommande.Pour ce qui est du fonctionnement, rien à dire: la télécommande et le logiciel sont assez simple d'utilisation.Je regrette quand mme l'absence de manuel en franais."
3,Better than regular S.F. but not as good as the low carb version,"The high protein S.F. is better than regular S.F. in that the sugar is reduced, but what I don't understand is way the low carb S.F. has 5g more protein (20g/can) than the ""high protein"" S.F. does (15g/can).For my money I say the 20g protein 2 carb ""low-carb slim fast"" is a better item, but this is still much better than the high sugar and carb loaded regular slim fast.Great for my out the door breakfast during the work week or when I don't have time for a sit down lunch.Sign up for Amazon's auto shipments on these items and you can get them sent to your door every month for about $1 less per case then I can buy them at the store."
4,"Good taste, but poorly shipped.",The product itself is very good. I have had two shipments so far. The 1st shipment had a few dented cans. The second shipment had quite a few cans dented-about half of them. Shipment packaging needs to be improved. It is a competitive price but I feel that I'm getting scratch & dent merchandise.
4,Great look and inexpensive,"Love my pendant lamp. Looks great, easy installation. Lamp looks wonderful in my kitchen above our bar. Very clean and modern look."
5,Classic American Indian Account!,"This is one of the absolute best American Indian first-person accounts available anywhere.The 22-page chapter of folkways based upon the instructions given by the tribal elders is invaluable to the modern reader/researcher. These cover the Winnebago religion, social etiquette, ""medicine,"" marriage and sex, precepts for women, and the wisdom of the old men.Highly recommended!"
2,Not really good sound quality,"I like the songs but the sound quality is not very good. The ""Premonition"" album has better sound, so I would recommend it instead."
2,SOUNDS ALL WONKY ?? Baddly Produced ! dissapnted ...,good songs !! but this company that put out this copy ! i think 20th cent. rilly got there transfer all fetched up . wonder if its just a bad one? ?
1,"Not The Best Of John Fogerty""Premonition"" Is The Best Dvd Ever Released",John Fogerty after making Premonition in 1997 or 1998 Live.Is the Best dvd He has ever made.I have it Love it John rocks all out In this dvd plays just about every Instrument there is.John Is a true showman was the best in his young years. A true Collectable for all JF Fans.I give this Cd a -1 Give Premonition a 5 +.
5,"All Caillou, all the time",There are no interruptions of the Caillou cartoons -- those annoying puppets that my daughter hated. There are topics in this that include three vignettes each.
2,Long unskippable previews,"The version I got had a long intro that could not be skipped. DVDs like this intended for kids should just start playing the actual content as soon as the disk is put in the drive. No warnings, no menus, and especially no 2 minute long previews for other stuff that you cannot skip past. Content is fine, same as on PBS."
4,Overall a great DVD for kids,"Overall, this DVD is great. No puppets, as mentioned in other reviews, but does include 3 stories for each episode plus songs. We don't mind the puppets so much; however, the songs that are included on this DVD are a great substitute. No whining and more interaction with Rosie since they're somewhat newer episodes.I would have given the DVD 5 stars, except for the really annoying commercial for other PBS Kids DVDs at the start of the DVD that plays EVERY time you put this one in. I wouldn't mind it so much if there was a way to bypass it; however, you can't skip to the main menu in any way, shape or form...you can't even fast forward through the stupid commercial."
2,Disappointed,"We had purchased the Me & My Mom game for my son a few years ago and he loves it. Lots to do, fun and interesting story, great graphics, and he loves the songs. Me and grandma has none of that. The story is boring, the graphics are much less sophisticated and its just all around inferior to Me and My Mom.I guess the true test is that my son still reaches for Me and My Mom to play with and hasn't touched Me & Grandma after the first week of owning it. Too bad. Makes me leary about purchasing another one."
1,How long...,"How long do you go on ""just getting started"" while relying on another job to pay your bills before you realize you're wasting your money, only making the diamonds richer?"
1,Lives Transformed?,"Yeah right...transformed millions of lives into problems! Remember, WHERE'S THE BEEF? WHERE THE MONEY? At the top of the pyramid!! Be wise, don't believe 'em."
2,Product packaged incorrectly?,"The product I ordered is in a green and red box, the tea I received is in an orange box with a dark blue sky in the background. I noticed the tea lacked the rich black tea flavor. The ingredients listed on my box are the same as on the red and green box, but the ingredients listed in amazon.com description for the orange box include beet root. Each of these products are caffeine-free herbal tea with roasted chicory. I purchased a 6 pack and hope I can have them replaced with the correct tea in the green & red box. This is not the flavor I ordered."
4,like it,"This tea is the closet to real tea you can get with out extra caffiene of regular tea. I mix 4 bags of this tea with 3 bags of organic black tea, and 3 bags of organic green tea. It makes a more healthy tea plus taste great."
3,the package has changed,"Note that the image depicted here is no longer the actual box that will be sent to you, because Celestial Seasonings changed the look of its packaging a few years ago. I was a big fan of this Caffeine Free Tea, but when they changed the packaging, it seemed to me that the tea lost a bit of its good flavor. It is still pretty good, but not as tasty as it used to be years ago when it came in the red and green box as shown in the picture. I even wrote to the company and asked about it, but all they could tell me is that they are still using the same ingredients. Oh well."
5,Years of tea drinking,"We have been drinking this tea for many years. Some of our friends prefer this tea. This tea has less bite than pekoe teas, no caffeine and makes a very satisfying cuppa, even when warmed up."
5,Tea on Time,"The Celestial Seasonings Tea arrived on time, and it seems to be in tip top shape. Keep up the good work. Jim"
5,Tastes like tea!,I love to make this in a gallon at a time and sweeting it with Splenda. I drink it all the time over ice and love it! I
5,Comprehensive View of This Magnificent Instrument,"Legendary oboe virtuoso Goosens coupled with Roxburgh give a broad orientation to this instrument.Included is history of the development of the instrument, reedmaking, basic playing techniques, suggestions on playing different types of music (baroque, classical, romantic, and contemporary), oboe repertoire, fingering charts, disc catalogue.Only thing missing this reviewer could find is source listing, and internet and info listing.Well done and enjoyable read."
4,Palliser novels,"I love the novels, but I was disappointed with this publishing. The inside margins are niggardly, making it quite difficult to read! But the material is first rate, a wonderful series, wonderful characters."
1,A real rip,Not worth the amount of money it took to ship this item don't waist your time or your money this thin piece of silcon took less than a penny to make it doesn't protect the either the inside or outside screens. Barely stays on the phone. Do your self a favor please do not buy this item.
2,"Great Product, Long Delivery Time","the product is great. however, it took longer to receive than what the seller advertised."
4,Excellent Protection,I ordered this for my pink razr and it works great. It is still transparent enough to see the pink!
5,The most insightful first-hand account of implementing lean.,"This book covers a number of great insights into the journey to leanness. It has the unique angle of having its case studies written by the people from the companies profiled in the studies. This gives a first hand review of the accomplishments and roadblocks that are part of becoming lean by those that went through them. Becoming Lean also gives accounts from people with personal experience from working for Toyota while they transplanted to North America to how the Japanese school system compares to and contrasts from the American school systems. In general, this book gives an excellent understanding that only a first-hand account can do. If you want to learn what it means to become lean this book is a must and should be used as a reference book while going through the lean transformation!"
5,A very good book for those involved in implementing Lean.,"I found this book very interesting and extremely practical. The chapters containing stories of Manufacturing companies currently implementing Lean are especially useful. Each contains a multitude of clear diagrams, worksheets, and examples of exactly what they have done. In addition, each company seems to have honestly commented on what works and what doesn't. If you are involved in implementing Lean Manufacturing in your plant, this is a must read."
2,At least the front cover looks cool.,"I don't like much Black Metal, but these songs would be pretty cool, if Rob Darken wasn't so racist and insane."
5,Fanf Shui,I got this book because I am a collector of cat items. This is a cute book to add to my collection. Also a great price.
2,Going to be republished,"This treatment of the life of Bartley Milam is about to be edited, rewritten and republished. It is best to wait for the new edition which will hopefully be out in the next year or so."
4,"Good Suite of Programs, but iMovie doesn't do HD AVCHD on a G5","I really like this new version of iLife- iPhoto 08 has some great new features and I feel like it is much more user friendly when it comes to managing your photos easily.- iMovie 08 is cool in that it has support for new video formats like AVCHD, and I like the new interface, but it has taken me a while to get used to it.- iDVD has some nice new templates- Garage Band has some nice new features as well.I decided to upgrade because I purchased an AVCHD camera (Canon's HG10) and the new version of iMovie does a great job with the footage on an Intel based Mac. However, when I tried to import the HD footage on my G5 Mac, it wouldn't import! It turns out that iMovie can only handle standard def AVCHD on a G5 Mac, not HD footage. This really bums me out - so be aware of this caveat."
5,ILife,I have uses most of the units on I Life and I have been pleased for the most part. It is easy to use and you should find them fun to work with.
4,iLife,"I purchased iLife to resolve a conflict I was experiencing between HD Movie, on an older system, and iMovie, on a newer system - It resolved my problem..."
2,First impressions,"The very first time I hooked up my Canon SD850 digital camera to import into iPhoto 8 what happens? Crash. Reimport. Crash again. Nothing but crashes.iPhoto then says there are photos that won't import and would I like to reimport. Saying yes results in a crash. Restarting then gives the same ""would you like to reimport"" message but with double the number of photos. Repeat and it will crash and ask to reimport 4 times the number of photos. At this point I stopped trying, but I assume iPhoto would continue doubling the number of photos to import until I ran out of disk space.I appears Apple did no real world testing with this product before release. This upgrade has almost been as bad as the transition from iLife 4 to 6 (the difference being that upgrade completely destroyed all my libraries and keywords. I had to manually reimport thousands of photos by hand).Apple does many things well. Apple also continues to have serious quality control issues that are still not being addressed."
3,All its apps are best..... except imovie,"All ilife programs are best , but imovie is worst version ever, where is the timeline on itBTW Apple put imovie HD with it ."
3,Pictures Do Not Lie,Hitler was a madman. Look at his face in the photographs in this book. Pictures don't lie. How could this madman fool a whole nation? To think how one man could change the world is beyond belief for my generation.
2,nice bowl,"the bowl is nice, but the wire it hangs on is too loose and easy to knock off.Better to get one that actually clips on the crate and use a watering can to fill it."
5,Perfect!!!,I just recently got a cage for my puppy beagle. And it works great. The bowl are not that big but it works for us because you really don't want your dog over eating and drinking water all day when they're locked in a cage.
2,Useless for us,"We purchased this bowl for our puppy, who must stay in a crate when we are not home. She is an active dog and can easily push the bowl out of it's metal ring holder and spill the water in the crate. so it's useless, as we have not found a way to attach the bowl to the holder."
4,"A great product for a smaller pet, just not mine :)","This 48 ounce bowl can barely hold 3 cups of food for my dog. If I were to put more than that in at a time, it leaves no space for his muzzle and causes a big mess of food to spill over the sides. This would be perfect for any dog eating 2 cups or less at meal time. The bowl itself is sturdy but I did have to zip tie the hanger to the kennel to keep it in place, but that was not a make or break it issue for me. I would definitely like to get the larger bowl in the future and would not hesitate to purchase from this same supplier! Too small for my dog but a great product for a smaller pet. Fast shipping!"
4,I would recommend,I really like the stainless steel hanging bowl. The size is perfect for my Great Danes. The only thing I dislike is that it does fall off the kennel. There aren't any brackets to hold the bowl in place so sometimes it gets knocked down if my Dane is pawing at the kennel door. But other than that it is great. I am able to move it around as she grows depending on her height. I would recommend it.
5,Excellent piece of hardware.,"Just bought one to replace my Roland snare arm. Very nice so far, 100% fit, very adjustable any direction I want, solid. Will replace all arms with this one."
5,Nice arm,"It's strong, well made, high quality metal, nice finish. It fits better than I expected. I can adjust the ball arm as I want.It has everything that someone would desire from a ball arm."
4,Enjoyable,I liked the new concept of flashing forward and seeing our future. Well played by the actors. Enjoyed this DVD and am waiting for the next installment.
5,A Great Replacement for Lost and 24 and a great competitor to Fringe,"FlashForward is a very interesting show with a very innovative concept. It is a shame that ABC cancelled it as a result of low ratings, which were an unforseen result of improper scheduling. Its not too late for ABC to bring it back for a second life, like Fox did with Family Guy. In the meantime, you can catch up with this show by watching the DVDs and getting to know the wonderful characters and world of FlashForward. Recommend it to your friends too. Your support will show how much we want the show back!"
2,Down with half-season boxsets,"It started with cable TV releases and now has begun to infest network television DVD releases; splitting up TV shows into half-season DVD sets. Sometimes it is because there is a break of half a year between season fragments, but in most cases it is just a ploy to get the consumer to pay more cash to acquire a full season. This is the second dubious TV on DVD release from ABC Studios (the first being non-original aspect ratio for Scrubs Season 8 DVD) and I do hope is not the start of a trend of releasing half-season sets after winter hiatus."
1,boring and bland,i really wanted to like this series but its painfully boring didnt get better at all.skip it!!
1,"good show, bad DVD set",I'd give the show itself 4 stars. But the DVD set gets 1 due to the nonexistence of a part 2 DVD set.Buy this instead:FlashForward: The Complete Series
3,interesting perspective,"As a parent of a child getting special ed services in Portland, OR, I found this quite interesting. We don't always know what is going on in these classrooms, especially if our kids have communication issues. This was an eye opener. The actual schools' names have been changed, it would be helpful to know their real identities."
1,Missing Retainer ring with 3 of the 4 we ordered,Ordered 4 center caps 3 of the 4 did not have their retainer rings. Disappointed this happened Requesting the items to be replacd or refund..
5,"Best Features for the price - Alarm, FM radio, Ipod Dock and Portable","This unit sounds pretty good, much better than a typical alarm clock. The ipod alarm/speaker market has a lot to choose from but options are very limited if you want a unit that has an alarm and is also a portable speaker system (6 AA batteries). There are other options such as iHomes iH26 but you will pay between $60-100 new. At $40 this is a great deal."
2,I didn't love this as much as I thought I would,"The concept is great. A mother's love is compared to a variety of infinites. There's one problem that bothers me about this book. The author says things like ""Said the mother horse to her child, I love you as much as a warm summer breeze."" Well, I love my children a lot more than I love a summer breeze. Another example...""Said the mother mouse to her child, I love you as much as the grain in the mill."" I think what she means to say is ""I love you as much as there's grain in the mill."" I think we all love our children more than a large stockpile of food. The wording is problematic. Instead of comparing a mother's love to infinity the author often uses strange comparisons that don't make a lot of sense."
5,So sweet!,"I bought this when I was pregnant with my first child and used it in our nursery decorations on the bookshelf. I started reading it when he was an infant and even now that he's four, it's still sweet. The pictures are wonderful and I can never look at the cover without seeing my own children's infant faces."
5,Our Favorite Bedtime Book!,"This book is just awesome! My husband & I read this to our 2-1/2 yr old son every night before bed. We alternate reading the pages, with me always ending on the precious last page of (human)mother & baby. The illustrations are WONDERFUL and it is just such a sweet little book. We've been sharing this book with our son since he was less than 1 yr old. We all love it!"
5,good bed time reading!,Tomas Aarrestad's new book is a great bedtime story for our children. Boys and girls will love to hear this story. The illistrations follow along well with the story for little eyes to watch and wonder. Enjoy!
5,Fantastic!,The whole cd is great and the first 4 tracks are amazing! This is one of those well-kept secrets that you wish you had found sooner.
5,I'm ready to be heartbroken...,"GREAT pure Brit pop. For some reason many critics label C.O. as a derivative pop band. Perhaps. But these reviewers fail to name anyone who makes more beautiful music""Aw jeez, more of the best pop music you've ever heard... yawn..."""
4,Exceptionally pretty songs,"Lead by Tracyanne Campbell, few bands can match Camera Obscura's lilting amalgam of prettified country pop and sheer craft. Their just released ""My Maudlin Career"" will likely rank amoung the top three albums of the year but this cd is worth owning as well. ""Underchievers Please Try Harder"" released in 2004 wedded a lo-fi 50's sock hop sound to a modern indie band veneer to charming effect. ""Lets Get..."" is less coy, more fleshed out and broader in tone. ""If Looks Could Kill"" taps Motown and the celestial melodic bliss of closer ""Razzle Dazle Rose"" is a straight faced cousin to The Smiths ""Some Girls Are Bigger Than Others."" What prevents this album from 5 star status is it never truly breaks out of its shell and is too insular to make a larger cultural impact but there is no denying the beauty on display here."
2,Kind of Fun...up to a point,"I do like this new record from Camera Obscura, but not so much that I'd leap to recommend it--one might do better just buying the single ""Hey Lloyd"" or a track like ""Let's Get Out of This Country"" from iTunes.As a devoted Lloyd Cole fan, I felt something along lines of an obligation to buy it, if only for the single ""Hey Lloyd, Are You Ready to Be Heartbroken?""Main comment I'd make here is that after a few listens, this recording grows a bit kitschy and trite--most of the tracks are set in a similar, tinny, 'faux 50s/60s' style--cute, kitschy, but ultimately limiting--record overall didn't make it too far over the hill for me."
2,sorry but they are WAY overrated,"the melodies aren't very remarkable, the singing is amorphous, the takes of the songsare kinda lackluster, and , as the review below notes, the lyrics arenot even CLOSE to literate (despite the Lloyd Cole reference).enough of these amateurs--stick to the REAL songwriters: THE BLACK WATCH, SPARKLEHORSE, andYO LA TENGO put out amazing albums this year. seek those out instead."
4,Macchina Fotografia,"This album is unique in that it still has the same Camera Obscura flavour, yet it has a foreign sound to it, unlike the sound in previous albums. Whatever they did, I quite like it and hope and pray that they give us something more to listen to one day."
5,Good product,This folder met my needs perferctly. It is a little pricey but does a ggod job of holding what I need to put in it.
2,OK if you don't mind poor sound quality,"This radio could be better.The Pros:Cost - this radio was realtivly inexpensive at around $35Features - Radio, CD, MP3 player hookups (no docking though), programable memory sets, and remote control.Ease of installation - The system installs pretty easily with a corless drill.The Cons:Poor Quality - The speakers sound like they are about to blow even at moderate sound levels. As long as you don't turn them up too loud you will be ok. Although the sound quality in general leaves a lot to be desired.Annoying Volume Control - whenever you switch the radio on it preset the volume to 17 (wich is pretty loud) so you have to get your ears blasted every time.So if you are on a budget, or don't like music too loud, it is a good buy."
1,lasted about a month,"I bought it 4 months ago, but didn't install it until about a month ago. I listen to audiobooks, which means leaving the unit on ""pause"" for hours at a time sometimes (maybe not a great idea, electricity-wise, but it's never caused a problem for a CD player before). The unit simply turned off and doesn't turn back on now, and there's a CD trapped inside. I called customer service, who told me that a transformer might have blown and that it's out of warranty (which was fine with me, it would not be worth the hassle and cost of shipping it just to get another one of these lemons). They had no ideas as to how to get the CD out, other than ""call a repairman"" (no thanks, I've got a hammer.) They did say if I send them the unit plus $30, they'll send me a new one. Not likely!"
1,Junk,"Bought this, CD player worked a couple of times over the last couple of months, now doesn't work. Cheap junk. If you only want a radio, it tunes o.k. The 90 Day warranty is a sham. They know it will last 100 days."
4,Nice features for the price,"I use it to listen to talk radio in the kitchen and it works well for that. It does have trouble picking up some weaker AM stations, but that could be caused by a lot of different factors. I do use it occasionally for music (both FM and CD) and it works fine but the sound quality is not great. The clock is cool looking but hard to read."
2,doesn't work right,I bought this to replace a tape clock radio that had died however this cd player is so sensitive the slightest scratch on the cd and it won't play it I have cds that work great in other players but sound like an old lp in this
4,lacking,"Not a bad product, but has very little bass response and the weather channel does not come in very well, no matter where the antenna is positioned"
3,Saito_Nanotubes,The quality of the book is high and the delievery was fast enough for what I was looking for.
4,Very Imaginative,"The cover is a little tricky simply because you can't fully grasp the excitement packed inside. It's certainly gripping from beginning to end. Great story line, very funny and imaginative. A must read. I'm definitely looking forward to part two."
2,Not terrible,"Gould has written a passable account of life as a Western journalist in the Former Soviet Union. Unfortunately, this take on Russia sort of narrows the potential reading audience. Nevertheless, some might find it a useful guide to what is possible when you persevere."
1,Lousy and superficial,Author spoke bad to no Russian and hung around gleaning her 'wisdom' about the country from the likes of english-speaking cab drivers. the worst and most tiresome crutch of a linguistic naif in a foreign country is to look for local color from a cab driver. Plenty of fluent Russianists wrote during this era; seek them out instead.
4,pride and Ownership,Good book for all levels of the fire department. It covers everything from the rookie to chief officers to fire buffs and more. Wide variety of topics such as a Fire Engineering usually has.
5,A must read for all firefighter's,"This is one of the best books I have ever read. Chief Lasky brings it back to the basic's of why we do what we do and to remind us to set the example. Have pride in our department, ourselves, and our communitiy. This book should be a must read for everyone in the brotherhood. Espescially new recruits."
3,Good read,"This book was a good read, helps to rekindle some of the fire you might loose halfway through your career."
4,Great Content,Chief Lasky does a great job in sharing his passionate message about fixing fire service problems by leading from the front. It is a video of a keynote address he gave at a previous Fire Engineering Conference.
3,"Good subject material, poorly written.","the author had a lot of great things to say. I tried to reference his material for a college term paper. He was difficult to quote becuase his writing was choppy. I did however like what he had to say, i just had to paraphrase quite a bit."
4,An unexpected DooWop revival,"If you were wondering where DooWop went...I've got news for you.. It's back! This Album is as good as the real thing! (She's not)Mona, Elevator of Love, great songs brought to you by the Crystalairs in great quality, nicely up-tempo and with great voices and DooWop backing vocals.. I love it!All the other suff at this Album like Lonely Teardrops and Never Such Love are, even for the purists among us, beautifully done.Take a look on the Internet, listen to Destination DooWop and DooWop Jukebox Gold and you'll know DooWop is Back!"
4,A religious fanatic's campy classic,"Rock music is spooky and leading our children to hell with its ""subliminal messages."" Or so the author would have you believe... This book is very, very funny, and deadly earnest. A bonus: some really great decadent rock quotes, used to bolster Aranza's view that rock music is Satan's tool. Of course, Janis Joplin didn't help matters by telling a journalist about her goals in life: [approx.]""to smoke dope, eat dope, sniff dope, and lick dope."" Talk about giving ammo to the enemy! A comedy classic."
1,disappointed,"Appears to be a well made product. However, it came with no directions, or templates. This may be an ok product if you hang doors for a living, but if you're a novice DIY like myself, this was a disappointing purchase. Went on-line to the manufactures web site and went from disappointed to frustrated. I would recommend buying hindges from someone else."
4,"Lighten Up, Why Don't You?","Roots, Schmoots: Journeys Among Jews is, first of all, funny. One should not come to it expecting to read a balanced, well-researched history/sociology of Judaism, Israel or the Diaspora. Think more along the lines of taking a long, relaxed (but neurotic as all get-out) trip with a very funny man in search of something even he can't quite identify.The chapters describing his time in the US are hilarious and poignant at once. The chapters on Israel are quite well done, capturing the author's exasperated love for the nation and its people, and his often wayward search for justice. Jacobson tries to avoid sentiment at all costs, yet continually finds himself caught up short by a lump in the throat. A very good, very funny travel book. A very good, very funny story of one person's hunt for himself. Not for the compulsively or competitively serious."
3,"If you want to know where you're from, take a look around...","Howard Jacobson is Jewish, of Lithuanian extraction and was born in Manchester. This book looks hard at Jewishness and takes us all over the world in search of what it means. I really wish he'd spent more time looking what part Manchester played in developing his sense of who he is and where he came from.Question: There's lots of talk about Yiddish, what part did native languages play in the various countries Jews settled in?"
4,Oddball enough to be considered entertaining,"Horror films move up and down the ratings chart so often, a choice generally becomes no more than a roll of the dice. This one came up boxcars. I recommend it ONLY if horror not completely off the believability charts is what you are looking for."
3,Very Violent,"One of the most violent movies I can recall. Hard to watch at times, but I did finish it (which I do not always do with movies). If you enjoy torture and bloodshed, you will like this movie"
3,Good not great,"I read all the reviews on how great this was. The torture was not that brutal. It's possible that I am so desensitized with horror movies however a lot of the scenes you did not see graphically. For instance when they are drilling the boys head you see a side view most of the time and have to assume the gore. That is wack! I want to see the drill going in the whole time. This is run of the mill on the same level as saw, hostel and gag. If you want some very graphic scenes then watch grotesque or even cannibal for some nasty torture. However overall it was good And deserves a viewing."
2,Not a great movie but watched it,Not the best movie but I watched it anyway so I did not hate it and I did not love it.
2,Haven't got to play it yet,Wouldnt play in my ps3 didn't no it was a region b DVD. Ordered a region free blue ray player just to play it so I hope it works but other than that shipped fast
2,VIOLENT BUT TOO GOOFY - IT'S NOT A HORROR FILM,"The trailer makes this thing look like an interesting movie but it actually plays out in such a ridiculous way that it's impossible to take it seriously as a 'horror movie'. This is a COMEDY, it is NOT a horror film by any stretch of the imagination. Sure people do sick things to each other but most of the time they constantly say such goofy things that NOBODY would ever say in real life (or even in a half-way decent movie) that it becomes one big ugly wink at the audience. The majority of the running time is just this guy getting humiliated like it's some kind of feminist fetish video. Also most people will probably HATE the ending. Save your money and keep looking. This is a really goofy stinker with a misleading trailer geared to rip-off horror fans."
2,"Very, Very Generic","I'm really surprised by all of the high praise in these other reviews. I didn't find anything at all unique about this movie. I've already seen Texas Chainsaw, Frotiere(s), Hostel, and any other movie where someone is tied to a chair and tortured for someone's amusement until the end when they escape. This one just incorporated a prom theme. They could have at least hinted at explaining why she was so crazy and murderous and why her dad would help facilitate her psycho desires. What happened to the mother? What happened to create this couple? They'd been doing it for a long time. And what was with the sub-plot with the dorky kid and the goth chick? I think their purpose was just to make this movie longer. If you like torture porn, this is another great one. If you're looking for something special or unique, you won't find it here."
2,WELL PRODUCED CRAP,Basically just another torture movie. If that's what you're into - and lots of people can't seem to get enough of it in these days - then you'll probably enjoy it.
2,Please enter a title for your review:,"Really no need to take a corny b-movie this seriously, but since everyone else is i'll jump on.The main problem with the villain's unique psychology being the centrepiece of the film is that it's not that unique or even consistent, with random transitions from an innocuous childlike mental state (to derive chills from her apparent ignorance of morality) to full self-awareness (to derive chills from her taunting) ruining the premise that any shred of depth in this horror setup hinged on."
5,Brilliant! Excellent film! extremely thought provoking!,Phelim debunks Al Gore's An Inconvenient Truth and all other global warming alarmists. It makes you think and causes you to ask questions. I'm grateful to Phelim for this brilliant film! It's definitely a must watch and share!
1,Glass House Throwing Stones,"While the film does address important issues, it seems to represent little more than counter-propaganda, and poorly informed propaganda at best. When you base an argument on 'junk science' and find a minority of the vast scientific community to support your cause how can it be aiming for anything else other than promotion of a counter agenda with its own slew of political and special interest related goals. The skewed logic and outright misrepresentation of facts make this a sad attempt to keep the engine of ignorance running."
5,Terrific translation,"I was both delighted and very impressed with Leonard Wolf's Yiddish version of ""Winnie the Pooh"". The Yiddish text is excellent - the language is so natural that reading it I had the impression that the Hundred-Acre Wood and all its inhabitants were located in Eastern Europe! There were expressions in the text that I hadn't heard since I was a child in New York. An excellent piece of work."
1,Claims by this supplier are bizaare,"This supplier claims to be selling this product at an ""incredible bargain."" Product is available for 1/3 of this price from other suppliers (including another supplier on Amazon). Supplier claims that supplies are limited. Perhaps this supplier's supplies are limited; there is no such limit on the supplies of other suppliers. This is a great product. Buy it elsewhere."
5,Very nice,I love this book because you can make a nice portfolio to show off any of your work. I had all my work laminated and the pages still fit nicely in the sleeves. They also let you get a free customized insert to place on the cover when you go onto their website. Great investment!
4,Six helpful pointers to help you learn to give,"Randy Alcorn's book contains a lot of wisdom about Christian living and Christian giving: I think every person who wants to live for Christ will be blessed by reading this book.However, it is a shame that he teaches tithing, when this is clearly not the focus of the New Testament. And some of what he has to say about himself, and particularly his comments on abortion, distract from what he is writing about.Do I agree with his abortion stance? Yes, but that is not the subject of this book and would put some people off.But, with this qualification, I heartily recommend the book, because of the 6 excellent principles for giving which he articulates."
5,Should Be Required Reading for All Believers,"As a Christian leader, I can say that I wish every believer could read this book. It is an excellent work regarding how we are to view money in this day when the pull of the culture toward material things is so strong. Alcorn helps you see that our treasure is waiting for us when we leave this place and we really don't need to be so consumed with the temporary things of this world. Our mission is to store up for ourselves treasures in heaven.Gene Jennings, Author of Timely Words"
5,WOW! This should be required reading.,"One of the best books that I have ever read. I can attest to how God blesses us for using His gifts wisely. I am thinking of buying a copy of this book for all 400 families at my church, the book is that good (and bibilically correct)."
4,Proud groupie of Benny The Whale,"I went to see Gym Class Heroes, another of my favorite bands, and these guys were opening. It was my first ever concert and I was expecting to be bored until GCH came out.To this day, Dozens of concerts later, that Patent Pending show was the second best concert I've ever been to in my entire life. They absolutely OWNED that crowd, And Michaels jesus act left me breathless.And of course, my first best show ever was also Patent Pending, at a smaller venue, where they had an entire crowd of Ska kids moshing like I've never seen a group of rich white kids mosh in my entire life.This band is the best live band I have ever seen in my entire life, and I would HIGHLY suggest this album, and even if you don't like it go see them live. It'll change your mind."
4,Worth reading only if you need to forgive...,"But if you have been seriously wronged, you need this. It is not the best written, but the material is great."
2,The Art of Forgiving,This book was a disappointment. I felt that it missed the mark. It is not a book that I care to keep in my library.
5,Best book of 2010,"This was my favorite book of 2010. It was an easy read, but with meaty content. It is down to earth, solid advice for anyone who needs to forgive."
2,Not my favorite of this writer,I didn't think the female or male leads were very strong characters throughout most of the book. Love this writer and will always read most of her materials but this was not my favorite book of her collection.
4,Derek!!,"At first,I didn't know how I was going to like Miranda but wow! I really enjoyed her and Derek's story!Yeah there's a rape scene,but just like the wild west this did happen. I think it was written well,and Derek did make sure it never happened again!"
3,Not my favourite - too slow and drawn out,This story started well but as the story went I became bored with it and actually fast tracked through the last few chapters. Was this a love story ? I supppose after 300 pages she finally accepts Derek but it takes her the whole book. The love ( rape) scenes were terrible.Sorry I hate giving bad ratings but I will have to give this one 3 stars and that is generous.
3,Innocent Fire - 1st book in the Bragg series,"Yeah, she got kidnapped 3 times. I don't understand how anyone can emotionally survived being abducted 3 times. The first time, she wasn't raped, but still violated. The second time, she was raped. The third time, she was unharmed. The other major flaw that I had with the book is that the heroine should have realized her love for the hero sooner. Derek and Miranda were together for weeks and she wouldn't let him bed her. Come on, the guy went through hell for her and yet she withheld herself. I do agree with some other reviewers that Derek definitely deserve better.The book is still a 3 star rather less even though of the flaws, because it did keep me wanting to finish reading it. It was frustrating at times, but I still enjoyed it when I finished the last page and wanted to read more in the Bragg series. So overall, I still recommend the book."
1,unbelievably annoying,"This is the first time I have read a book by Brenda Joyce and will not do so again. The heroine of this story is the most annoying woman ever. She cries all the time, and it is a an utter mistery to me why a men like Derek would be attracted to her. She is cold and mean to him. And yes, she was raised in a convent but come on! And how many times can someone get raped in the course of one book. This was somewhat disturbing. Let's just say the book was very disappointing."
2,Don't Boo me yet...,"I'm a huge fan of Brenda Joyce...I've really liked most of her books and the rest of the ""Bragg Saga"", but Innocent wasn't as great as I was expecting it to be considering the others in the series were good. I really like the ""older"" Miranda (the grown up mom you meet in the others)...but the young Miranda just absolutly grated...and I mean grated on my nerves.I still can't believe Joyce repeated the same scenes over and over and over again. Maybe this was one of her first books (I'll give her that), but letting Miranda get kidnapped as much as she did just got totally boring.I will say that I'm so very glad I did read this one. It was nice to see how the Bragg's and their close family came to be.***This book includes near rape and rape scenes. If you normally shy away from books with this kind of content you may not want to read it"
2,unsatisfying western romance,"I've enjoyed a few of Ms. Joyce's novels, even the very un-PC ""The Conqueror"" but this one left me with a sour taste. With too much violence for a romance novel, at least for my tastes, and an unappealing heroine, by the novel's end I was left with a feeling of exhaustion rather than exhilaration."
1,"Rape, Rape, and more Rape","I found this book to be one of the most disturbing books I have ever read. The heroine is continually raped. I read romance novels to enter a world of fantasy and joy not a world of crime and pain! I had to force myself to finish this book to put it behind me. After reading it I was depressed and disgusted for three days! I loved Brenda Joyce's other books so I just wanted to tell you that they are usually great. I can't say I would recommend this book to a friend, an enemy definitely."
1,violent & yet annoying reading,"it's hard to imagine not feeling sympathy for a heroine who has been ripped from her mother's love,thrown in a convent,brought to a foreign land and raped several times. in this book,however, it's not impossible. this heoine is absolutely annoying and one wishes she stayed in the convent.her rampant and total disgust of her own sexuality,perhaps somewhat understandable, makes one ask why would the hero put up with her time after time after time until almost the end of the book. this woman has some truly deep seated emotional issues which are not addressed as such and certainly given short shrift in thier resolving. i loved our hero but kept hoping for someone better for him! one can't help but wonder exactly what he does see in her either at the beginning or finally at the end of this violent book."
1,WTF!!!!,"This book is baaad and not in a good way. Having read Fires of Paradise, Scandalous Love and Secrets I had faith that reading this particular book would be an extremely enjoyable experience Boy was I wrong!!!! Miranda is the worst heroine of any romantic book I ever read. Never has a writer written a more annoying spineless heroine EVER!!! If I could give a negative rating I would NOT hesitate. Got to a point where I found myself desperately wishing she would be choke on one of her indignant gasps.It completely put me off the remaining novels in the Bragg series."
4,A great book..but heartwrenching what the heroine had to go through.,"A great book, but I feel for the heroine. Miranda had so much to go through. I felt bad for her, and she was somewhat wimpy. But in the end, she overcame all of that. The hero Derek was great, sweet, and patient. He was a tough guy but he was wonderful. I felt the author got him right and could have improved on the heroine. I will be reading the 2nd book in the series."
5,Excellect perspective...,"This is a uniquely important book! Maybe those who so vividly expressed their disappointent in their reviews, misunderstood the title! The book is about DEVELOPING MIND, which means about how certain class of brain processes we call 'mind' come into being as the brain rewires itself.Most of the literature seems to be assuming that these proceses somehow come into being and focus on deciphering their meaning and purpose assuming the 'mind' to be like a computer in the skull we are born with which is ready to use and it is suficient to switch it on.But clearly, this less ingteresting frame, since the 'mind' never remains the same as a kind of static 'thing.' What is fascinating, is its continuous development process. The book presents very readable explanatory model. Minsky says that ""brains use processes that change themselves[...] The principal activities of brains are making changes in themselves."" Siegel explains how this happens and this is a fascinating narration."
5,Amazing,"Organizational Behavior: Human Behavior at Work. I would have wanted to know the state of the book. Since I did not have the full details I had to take a chance with Amazon.com and i did, Now I am happy with the results. It is a book that I had borrowed on short term and I can truly say that I have my own personal book. It is informative, user friendly( not complex).Thanks."
3,Not what I expected,"The book arrived on time and I appreciated it that. However, the cover looked like it had gone through a war. I know, I know what can you expect from a used book. My other classmates have purchased used books and most of their books look new. That's why I decided to purchase a used book. I'll have to be more careful of who I select to purchase from in the future."
4,Great Movie :),"This movie was amazingly good! There were parts that were funny, but the majority of it is sad... so get your tissues ready when watching it. It's a good film to represent the hardships that not only Andrew went through during his time of treatment for his Leukemia, but everyone else that has had to go through those same or similar hardships as the ones in the film, even if it's another disease like cancer. Andrew makes a stand by being courageous enough to turn his clips into this wonderful movie and showing it to the world. This is definitely a movie you want to watch if you are a fan of either Jack's Mannequin or Something Corporate. It will help you to truly appreciate Andrew's music that much more."
3,"Well plotted and scary, but something is missing.","Rick Hautala's story of a man returning to Maine with his family to claim an inheritence is tightly plotted and scary, but something seems to be missing. The supernatural events seemed unexplained (perhaps I just didn't 'get it'). While the characters, as usual, are well developed and credible and the novel is definitely frightening, it just isn't one of Hautala's best. Still recommended though."
2,"Cute, but impractical","I really liked the look of this bag online, but when it came it was HUGE. It looks reasonably sized in the picture, but I could carry my baby, my dog and all the things they both need for a weekend trip in it. Easily. I can't think of any reason a bag this large is necessary. I love the pattern on it and the colors are adorable."
5,Amazingly durable,"I've been wearing these, stuffing them in my pockets and backpack, tossing them on the passenger seat of my car (where they get buried in stuff), dropping them on the ground, etc. for over two years now - not only have they survived, the lenses are virtually unscratched. Very good value, they look good, and they're well made."
3,Mythical Greek action figure...,"Well constructed body, but arms & spear are a bit thin. If this toy was made for rough play, it will not last the year in the hands of a 6-year-old boy."
3,Where in the world is osama by Brandon M. Moskos,"I was actually disappointed in this film. I believe the main idea trying to be displayed in this movie, is to try to get the audience a more understanding of the face of terrorism. All he pretty much does is go around to countries most americans wouldn't go to, and ask the people if they know where osama bin laden is. All you pretty much get out of it is that the people of these countries don't dislike american people, they dislike the american government. I bought this dvd, I was very excited to watch it, but I recommend renting it."
4,Revealing - Shows Widespread Antagonism Towards the U.S.,"""Where in the World is Osama Bin Ladin?"" was made in 2008 and captures on film the Middle East's issues with hopelessness for young, jobless men, and the powerlessness of the masses. As Morgan Spurlock tours the Middle East while awaiting birth of first child back home, he compares their future, with his new child's. It is prescient to the current revolutions in those areas and also gives the feeling that the revolts are long-lasting and just beginning.Overall you can see the hopelessness of the poor and what spurred the current riots in the Middle East with dashes of humor as Morgan peeks into Afghanistan caves calling ""Obama, are you in there?""The U.S. military and foreign aid are highlighted and come across as fruitless."
3,Stiff plastic cover but serves the purpose,"Outside cover is made of stiff plastic, so it's not ideal for constantly opening and closing the binder. It took some effort to open and set up to display the presentation materials. It's durable but not professional looking."
2,"Fun to read, disappointing hotels...","I love flipping through this book. The descriptions of places to stay are fodder for glorious daydreams. Sadly, I followed Ms. Brown's suggestions and spent a few weekends at several of these Inns and Chateaux. What a disappointment! Most were lovely on the outside, tired and drab on the inside. Not at all as she had described. Skip it."
1,Utter garbage,"This is the third Linksys router I've owed in less than five year. I'm shopping for another make now. These pieces of garbage fry within a year, they disconnect your connection from the internet for no reason, even after several attempts at resetting. The connecting ports are just too cheap to maintain contact with the motherboard. And my units are left in cool, dark places, with no movement, no static to fry them. Customer service? You must be joking. This company needs to close and stop selling products and ripping people off. One star is TOO generous"
2,Not worth it.,"We had and used this router for years when we had Vonage. It consistently dropped signals and, when it worked, gave off a very slow, weak signal. I got it from Vonage with my account. As time went on, this router got weaker and worse, to the point where we had to reboot it sometimes twice daily for any kind of signal at all. The admin panel is unnecessarily complicated.We just tossed them both, this router and Vonage, and went with the Apple Airport Extreme. I'll never look back."
1,Bust product,"Don't put this ""dog"" (sorry to insult my canine friends) near Vonage. Your VOIP experience will become a living hell. Go with the (only somewhat less terrible alternative) from Vonage (DLink router)"
5,Excellent reading about the South's top cavalry leaders,"This is an easy to read book that captures the heart and daring of the South's most flamboyant leaders. The authors have selected a number of exciting antedotes from the likes of Stuart, Mosby, Wheeler, Forrest and Morgan, Hampton, and Van Dorn. If you enjoy the sound of hoofbeats pounding in the night, then you are sure to enjoy this book."
3,Glory at a Gallop,"Fun, anecdotal narrative history, comprised of a series of essays on Confederate cavalry raids. (Battles generally aren't covered, with the exception of Brice's Crossroads.)Somewhat less than deep scholarship--the chapter on Stuart at Gettysburg isn't the best, and Morgan's guerrilla-like side gets lost in the chivalry--but generally an interesting read that captures the exhilaration of a deep raid."
1,"""Where's the Peanuts""","Just what the title says ""Where's the Peanuts"". Every box I have bought the peanuts are small and few and far between. It should be called ""Old Dominion Brittle"". Have bought my last box of this brand."
2,"Lies all around, not happy at all","I bought this looking for Old Dominion brand peanut brittle. This is not Old Dominion brand, nor was it made by Old Dominion. The brittle we received was made by SweetGourmet.com, and the other reviews are right, there are very few peanuts in this product and something just tastes slightly off. It's technically edible and it's technically peanut brittle, so I guess I won't worry about returning it, but I don't like being misled.Product is a bag of brittle pieces shipped inside a box, someone mentioned it arriving smashed up, well honestly, I think it was supposed to arrive somewhat smashed up and not as a solid sheet which is what I think that reviewer and I were both wanting."
1,very few peanuts,"Bought an 8oz.box of Old Dominion Old Fashioned Peanut Brittle, only to find that there were hardly any peanuts in the brittle. Sure didn't look like the nice picture on the box . A piece the size of the picture had about 3 nuts in it. Very dissatisfied."
3,"Too Much Sugar, Too Little Peanuts","Too Much Sugar, Too Little Peanuts, A perfect recipe for dental decay and that quick sugar high we all need while stuck on the 405 during rush hour. But peanut brittle? I don't think so."
1,Peanuts?,I bought a box of this stuff (I won't qualify it!) and would not give it to my dog! The company that makes this ought to be called Old Dog Doo!
3,"Not captivating, but a unique story nonetheless","I had high hopes for this book. Eleanor sarcastically invites her husband's mistress, a young black girl named Natalie to live with her family. Natalie is free, expressive and open in a way that Eleanor envies. Eleanor and Natalie begin to form a close relationship, as does the curious Adam, the young 13 year old son of Eleanor and John. John is obsessed with possessing Natalie and the story takes a tragic turn. Eleanor escapes her life, leaving her son behind and does not return to her town until 15 years later. Adam and Eleanor are strangers, haunted by their past. I could not really understand Eleanor and Adam during their attempts to reconcile.When I picked up this book, I expected a compelling story that would captivate me. I was a bit disappointed, as the writing style was a bit flat and repetitive. I give the book 3 stars based on the original storyline, but the characters confused me, and I could not really warm to them."
3,Careful What You Wish for:,"I write this because of the four previous reviews. A good story. A good first novel but not great. This writer repeats her self in too many details, tears, hair standing up, bird , butterflies etc. The first half caugh my attention but the second half was slow. I was interested enough with the characters to stay with it and I am glad I did. I would try her next book as I think Hermes has a lot of talent."
4,Successful first novel,"As a Southerner I am always skeptical of novels set in the South but written by someone not from there. But Ms. Hermes has successfully avoided the traps and cliches I expected. She has created a beautiful and somewhat sad world for her characters--the true strength of the novel--to inhabit. I highly recommend reading this novel, preferably on a rainy, windy afternoon."
2,Not my cup . . . of anything,"Imagine if you will, a death defying situation, earthquakes, evil henchmen chasing you. What do you do? You stand around and tell each other how wonderful you are and how much everyone (the good guys, that is--the bad guys are all unremittingly evil) loves everyone else, especially the main character. I finally decided that I could only read this book as a camp fairy tale--that despite unbelievable odds nothing remotely bad happens to the good guys. Then I guess someone pointed this out to the author, so in a jarring change, the ending takes on a few tinges of reality. The editing allows things like characters supposedly a few hundred miles away popping up in a scene to make a comment. Typos abound. This book feels like a first draft with a cover slapped on it. Read it only if you want a (very) mindless lesbian adventure."
2,"Inspiring song, disappointing album!","If you take out amazingly musical and moving ""Le Vent Nous Portera"", there's nothing left to listen to. I bought the CD after listening ""the song"" on TV hoping to catch at least 1 or 2 more good songs in the album, however it was total diappointment for me. Download ""the song"" from the web and listen over and over. No need to buy the CD."
5,"Chére amouroux d'alternative, ce cd est à vous","when i first listened to ""le vent nous portera"", i was really impressed to buy this cd. all songs are incredible but my favorites are ""Europe"" and ""Lost"". don't miss that album, trust ""moi"""
1,Dont buy it. That's waste of money,"Grips don't fit any levers at all, for very simple reason, they come almost uncut. I mean, they are supposed to be an elastic tube, which will stretch a bit to fit the lever. But due to very poor quality, it is uncut, so you must do it yourself. Well, the problem is - you cannot do it as well : )I ordered the red ones and first time I took them out of package, I saw that red paint stayed at my hands. I tried to cut the holes and then tried to fit it, but no way. In 5 minutes, one grip was torn and both were not red any more. Whole paint was at my hands and material itself - was of dirty pinkish tone with black spots. Even if I could fit these grips to levers, with such poor painting ""job"", they will deteriorate immediately. In addition, this was very poor quality polymer material - was torn with minimal stretch effort appliedDONT BUY IT! I think, no seller should spoil their reputation by selling such inferior product. The same refers to manufacturer"
1,No Fun at All,"This video was about as fun as dental work (with apologies to my excellent dentist). The instruction was lacking, the trainer lacked charisma and energy, and even he had difficulty with some of the moves. Combining the balancing with the strength work takes practice and coaching, but the trainer just went into each move without any kind of information about how to do so. (I've worked out for years, but would have needed help finding ways to do the upper body work while standing on one leg.) I went to Target after watching the dvd once and bought The Firm for $12.00 (rather than $19.95), which is much better and more effective.M. Yarosh"
2,"Starts out slow, then tapers off","I have been a big fan of the radio show Prairie Home Companion for over a decade. I have also read several articles by Garrison Keillor who is, without a doubt, a gifted writer.I came to this with an open mind, not knowing what to expect.To say the least, it was a big disappointment.It was about as entertaining as watching paint dry.I kept waiting for something to happen as the story line just meandered along like a slow moving bovine not having any idea where it was going.It is long.It is boring.It is without any of the inspiration that powers the radio show.Avoid this movie at all costs unless you suffer from insomnia."
1,Okay start.,"The movie kicks off with a postive start, but as time goes on seems to drag on. I fount myself sitting there wishing the movie would end. It has a ensemble cast, and they all do a great job but even that doesn't save the movie. The singing scenes are fun at first, but as the time goes on like the movie they all start to drag on."
1,couldn't finish watching it because I fell asleep of boredom,"Sometimes Robert Altman's ensemble dramas are spectacular (Gosford Park), sometimes they are the best medicine for the sleep-deprived (Dr. T and the Women). Unfortunately, this movie is the latter. Despite the wonderful cast, this movie drags on and on. About an hour into it, I zonked out. Maybe, I'll go back to it and finish watching it, but if I do, it's only due to the respect I have for the actors. I'll admit that I might be lacking the necessary background to see the movie (having never heard the radio show); still, what kind of movie limits it's audience to only the baby boomers and excludes everyone else?"
2,Where is the movie?,"Boring, boring, boring, wish it was more. Not a good use of the actors they hired."
4,A view into a magic world,"This movie is a delightful romp in the world of Garrison Keillor's mystical Lake Woebegone. It is the story of the last night of production of A Parrie Home Companion a radio variety show that time seems to have forgotten. They are all there, Guy Noir the Private detective, the philosopher cowboys, the sound effects man, the Guy's Shoes All Star band. All the characters from the show. If you recognize any of these names this movie is for you. If you are not a fan of that place where al the women are strong, the all men are good looking and the all children are above average then this movie is not for you. If your spirt longs for a place where Alice Kerpsah grows the prize tomatoes and BeeBobAreeBob Rhubarb Pie takes the taste of humiliation away than don't miss it. One only hopes that the real last show is many years in the future."
3,"Wit, sense and fun","Great humour, serious view on the meaning of life and a lot of musical fun - radio with a view."
1,"Sounds good, nothing else.","I watched this to the end, what a waste of time !!!! I read the other reviews before viewing this, and guess I am just not savvy or astute, or something enough to ""get it"". A long list of very talented actors sang their hearts out, and wasted their time also. Get the sound trac and listen to it while doing something else."
4,The Cinema From Lake Wobegon,"Robert Altman turns Garrison Keillor's long-running radio show into a truly unique experience. In less capable hands, this celluloid translation could have been disastrous. However, Altman is the perfect filmmaker to capture Keillor's musical and storytelling charm. An impressive cast (Woody Harrelson, Kevin Kline, Lindsay Lohan, John C. Reilly, Meryl Streep, Lily Tomlin) complements Keillor's radio ensemble with their comedic and vocal talents. Though a bit pretentious at times (Virginia Madsen's ""Dangerous Woman"" gradually wears out her welcome), Altman and Keillor maintain a comfortable tone of lighthearted nostalgia. Not for all tastes, but a must for any ""Prairie Home Companion"" listener."
1,dont rent this,"With so many well-known stars, I thought this would be a good rent. I was sorely mistaken. What a waste of star power. The script must have been written by neurotics. It's nothing but annoying chatter, bad make up jobs and clothes, and a creepy chick that's supposed to be an angel. There's only one good part that lasts all of three minutes when woody is singing a dirty song. Save your money."
1,Oscar candidate for sure,"This is the best movie I have seen in years. Tears to belly laughs in the change of a scene, well acted characters, and a wonderful gentle story. It is a thought provoking and intellectually satisfying film that I could (and will) see again and again. A fabulous cast is mixed in with the radio show cast and it is next to impossible to tell who is the famous actor and who is the voice I have only heard over the radio. I would bet that it was great fun to film and that there are some wonderful outtakes that will hopefully make it to the DVD."
2,The trouble with Hollywood movie stars pretending to be real singers.,"As Mick LaSalle of The San Francisco Chronicle said, ""'The Prairie Home Companion' is like a Hollywood karaoke movie."" Truer words were never spoken. I'd rather watch ""American Idol"" over this movie. At least it's free."
1,Wow that was bad.,"How can so many talented people make a movie this bad? Given all of the positive reviews it had received, I was really looking forward to seeing this film. What a waste of time! It tries to be some deep meditation on death and the passage of time but what it succeeds in doing is drain all of the charm from the Prairie Home Companion radio show. All of the actors are playing caricatures but Kevin Klein takes home the ham for over-acting. On top of that, the performances were so loose that at times I thought Altman turned on the camera, threw out the script, and just let the actors goof off. If you like Garrison Keillor, buy his audio recordings of the real PHC. If you like Robert Altman, buy MASH or Nashville or Gosford Park. Just stay away from this muddled mess."
5,"Prairie Home Companion, a Happy-Sad-Nostagic Film",For anyone who listens to A Prairie Home Companion on PBS this movie will resonate favorably. For those who are not radio listeners it will introduce them to the show and my bet is they will become regular listeners.
3,You Gotta Love Garrison,"If you are a fan of the NPR radio show by the same name, then you will like this movie. Just seeing a vision of how the show ""might"" be put together each week on the radio is interesting in itself. Garrison Keillor's creativity and that of his cast is highlighted in the movie, and the addition of stars of the magnitude of Meryl Streep, Tommy Lee Jones and Lilly Tomlin bring greater interest to the viewer. I like the movie, but think that those who like the radio show are more likely to appreciate the movie than those who have never heard it."
1,Was there a script?,"If you want to see a movie that tries way too hard to be charming (but isn't), with lots of improv stories that are meant to be clever (but aren't), and you are willing to sit and patiently give occasional courtesy laughs (at best) for the length of a feature film, then you'll love this one. Seriously, by the end I was rolling my eyes whenever a character began yet another pointless, unbelievable and supposedly ""charming"" recollection/story.Good points: the music and the singing (particularly Streep's vocal performances - is there anything this woman can't do?).Bad points: pretty much everything else.I guess there's a reason that PHC is a radio show. Should've stayed that way."
5,love this,"Such a great movie. Garrison Keillor is a very Funny man, and his straight face makes him all the more funny. a great movie for the family to enjoy. You'll laugh and cry and laugh again."
5,Prairie Home Companion DVD,This is a unique film! It's music and humor is absolutely charming!The cast is great as well.
5,An unexpected find,"I bought this as a gift based on the quality and diversity of the actors involved. It has exceeded all expectations and is one of those gems that you find every once in a while.Meryl Streep and Lily Tomlin show how they have achieved their professional status with these performances. Also very informative to view the Extras, especially the interview with Robert Altman, the (now deceased) Director.This DVD is now doing the rounds of friends who all report similar reactions."
1,The CD was scratched and not viewable the last 10 minutes of the movie.,The CD was scratched and not viewable the last 10 minutes of the movie.We ended up throwing it away
3,Jabo,The movie is entertaining but drags at times. I've heard the Prairie Home Companion on radio for a long time. Now I have a better idea about their production and personalities.
2,This is not what one would expect,"As one who watched when Prairie Home Companion was broadcast by PBS and listened on the radio for the rest of the years I was not impressed by this DVD. I listen to Prairie Home Companion because it is uplifting and entertaining. This movie is slow and depressing and the only thing I found of value was the music tracks on the bonus menus. I received more enjoyment from the 30 year anniversary DVD. This movie did not reflect the values and talents of the radio broadcast. However, it may be a good indication of what is coming to the show."
5,A Prairie Home Companion,"If you except to find the dumb comedy that's on TV today, you will not enjoy this movie. Otherwise it is very funny and entertaining."
5,If you're 'a bit' sentimental... this one's for YOU.,"GKeilor has now reached the full status as an american icon; he has positively influenced Millions of listeners and viewers of his shows (radio & stage). It constantly amayzes me that Gary has not burnt himself out putting on this show (for about 40 times a year)...Talent, pure talent. I don't think there's a bit of ego or pretentiousness in the man.We can muse regarding the 'artistic' value of this film, but I couldn't keep eyes dry (I started seeing GK many, many years ago).I Hated to see his (or Altman's) efforts panned.Gk is an american icon-institution, and we're all a bit better off because of him.Three times and counting..."
2,Dull Dull and Dull,"Did I mention that it was dull? The acting is good, but otherwise nothing was particularly appealing. Someone wrote that it was like sitting around with your grandparents listening to them tell stories about how it used to be. Pretty accurate.I suppose this movie speaks to a specific demo within a specific generation and it's not mine. I didn't know anything about the real radio show or Garrison Keilor so this movie was completely wasted on me."
1,I just didn't get it...,"Well, I listen to the radio show almost every week, but 2 out of 4 people left the room at about one hour & 8 minutes into the thing. One of the 2 left fell asleep, leaving me waiting for something to watch.For me, the best 3 or 4 minutes was the ""Bad Jokes"" scene. I had everyone come & watch that part with me.So...we just didn't get whatever was trying to be portrayed by the movie. Glad I didn't have to pay to rent it!--Debbie in GA"
1,What a disaster!!!,"I thought this movie would be fantastic with its all star cast of superb movie stars like Kevin Kline, Meryl Streep and Lily Tomlin etc.Instead the movie was extremely slow, boring, and drawn out!! It was so bad that 45 minutes into the movie, I couldn't stand watching another second of it. So, I stopped the movie and promptly returned it to the video store I rented it from.If the movie moved at a swifter pace and was a bit more witty, then perhaps it would have been good."
1,"Boring, pretentious, plotless","I should preface this review by stating that I have never (and now never will) listened to Garrison Keillor's radio show. This was movie was really awful. I have never walked out of a movie in my life until this one. After an hour of trying to keep myself awake, I couldn't take it anymore. The movie has absolutely no plot and you never feel a connection to any of the characters because there is no character development at all.I stayed as long as I did trying to figure out what I was missing. Were there subtle sub-plots mixed with symbolism that I hadn't been smart enough to see? The answer is no..."
4,Nobody Works Up a Sweat and That's Just Fine,"The premise is completely false of course -- A Prairie Home Companion is in no danger of disappearing from the airwaves in any of our lifetimes. But that's fine too -- it is a pleasure to watch the likes of Meryl Streep, Lily Tomlin, and Truman Capote, oops, Phillip Seymour Hoffman meander their way through some pretty good country songs (though far short of the best from Altman's Nashville) and some truly awful jokes while death, in the form of a beautiful angel, stalks the stage. Kevin Kline as a gumshoe and Tommy Lee Jones as a Christian radio owner zealot also have a wonderful time with their roles. I got the impression that GK was hugely pleased to have so much talent on his show, if only in movie form. But all this talent is immersed in, frankly, fluff, entertaining fluff, but fluff nonetheless. Robert Altman's master talents were taxed not at all, kind of like watching Tiger Woods play putt-putt golf."
1,The absolute worst,"I can't believe that I spent a healthy chunk of my life watching this mess. I used to be a fan of the PHC, but it seems to have deteriorated to this low level. How very sad."
1,Not worth the rental fee - It SUCKS,"This was a big disappointment of a movie. It sucks. One of the worst attempts at entertainment I have ever witnessed. I want my rental fee back!!!! I rated it a one star, If I could rate it lower I would."
2,Boring,The movie was a disappointment. Stellar cast improvising on the stage. And Garrison Keillor does not even tell a story! Soon after the movie the director died--must have been from boredom creating this movie.
2,Time Better Spent Alone,"I've never much cared for Altman, and this film displays his fashionably nihilistic, aimlessly sappy meanderings at their worst. A grave injustice to Garrison Keillor's quirky weekly broadcast and a typically Altman-esque waste of a great cast. Surprisingly, it's Lindsay Lohan who acquits herself most admirably with understated comic performances that cannot be missed: so, both for her scene delivering a mangled rendition of ""Frankie and Johnny"" and for her portrayal of an adolescent's interactions with her harried show-biz mom (played well by an otherwise criminally underutilized Meryl Streep), this movie might possibly perhaps be a little worth watching ... almost - but for those scenes alone and for nothing else! Blech. Double-blech. Avoid!"
5,Hello from Lake Wobegon...,"Ol' GK himself doesn't pretend to be anything he isn't; just not him. In context with the penguin joke: Penguin #1 says 'You look like you're wearing a tuxedo'. Penguin #2 says 'what makes you think I'm not?' All the music in this glimpse of Garrison Keillor and the long running radio show which aired out of the Fitzgerald Theatre in St. Paul,MN was performed by the actual actors, adding to the realism and downright upper midwest prairie spirit so prevalent to this day. Meryl Streep and Lily Lomlin as Rhonda and Yolanda Johnson, Woody Harrelson and bad jokes"
5,Prairie Home Companion,I loved the movie. True to his reviews Garrison was great. The movie reminded me of the shows I saw in person back in the 70's and 80's in St. Paul!!It was a swell movie and I recommend it highly.
3,home on the range...,"It's a quirky Robert Altman film. (Perhaps that's redundant?) Altman films tend to be more about character and setting, rather than plot, and he succeeds best when he does manage to squeeze in some kind of plot. He doesn't really manage this here. So, the result is a good set piece, showing the last day in the life of a radio show, and its characters. Altman's films do really allow you to connect with the characters, and this is no exception, so this is a medium hit on that basis. Meryl Streep's here, and so is Lindsay Lohan, so it kind of balances out."
2,"I love Keillor, but this is deadly dull","Based on the ratings, I suspect kindhearted people think they SHOULD praise this film because of the likeability of its stars. But from the heavyhanded appearance of ""Death"" to the self-conscious acting styles to the endless songs (you deserve a medal if you don't ever hit fast forward), this simply does not even approach the charm, wit and easy musicality of the Prairie Home Companion radio show. Also, the DVD transfer seems a bit dark."
3,Should have trashed script and just done live show,"The parts that are just the quasi regular show are good, with Garrisonand the regular singing, humor, and pithy philosophy. The subtexts, however, about an angel, Guy Noir, and the death of an old man were pointless and obtuse. The Tommy Jones cameo was somewhat effective and clear cut, although a bit over-the-top. Meryl and Lily had good chemistry. The cowboys were funny. However, overall better just to listen to the show on the radio."
3,Not Quite Like Anything Else,"Anomie. That's what projects from this movie.It's a term labelling social fabric existing and yet masking a sense of disconnectedness and disorganization.The collaboration between Robert Altman and Garrison Keillor was so promising. Two totally original, brilliant and creative people coming together on a project about something so beloved, so entrenched in our culture.The result hits some marks, to be sure: the steadiness of midwestern people, the deadpan humor. And then we get death, too, in the form of a beautiful trenchcoated woman. And who knew that Meryl Streep was such a fantastic singer!When we finished watching it, my wife said, ""Well, it's better than when William Shatner writes for himself."" Her perception is dead accurate. The inevitable self-absorption of this effort is not quite as bad as William Shatner writing scripts for Captain Kirk.But it gets damn close. I doubt we'll watch it again."
1,Prairie Home Boredom,"I love the radio show. But this was not that. Instead we eavesdrop into contrived backstage personalities that I ultimately just didn't care about, and found little to do with the radio show. Was this about Prairie Home Companion, or was this some other movie with Garrison & crew performing somewhere in the distant background as a pale backdrop to stories that I just didn't believe. And Lindsey Lohan, who has broken the 4th dimension by becoming a strange personality more powerful than anything this bad actress can create, was too distracting. Seeing her I kept wondering what Paris Hilton was doing right now."
1,Watered down; some people are better not on film,"There is a reason why the radio show is magical - because you have to imagine the characters from the voices.This movie is a total failure. Garrison Keillor has a beautiful voice and probably has a live on stage charisma, but is so physically homely that he should not be in a movie. He appears stiff and self conscious. He is not meant to be a cinema actor. He is a super talented writer and singer but visual acting is not his thing. He is really unfortunate to look at. The make up looks really pasty on him. He is the kind of person who should have a shiny oily face, so he looks real rather than all powdered up and trying to look beautiful.Throwing celebrities in there does not help. Rather, it heightens the sterility and lack of chemistry among the actors who are not really singers and should be working in dramas, not musicals.Was the script bad, or the ideas bad, or execution bad. Don't know what to blame. It's just a terrible movie."
1,"Plotless, Pointless","The fact that most movies made nowadays are without a plot or point does not come as a shock to me (or, I sincerely doubt, to anyone else). However, the fact that Garrison Keillor whose weekly PHC radio sessions draw heavily on the use of narrative and dialogue would star in a film that is sorely lacking in both does come as a shock and disappointment to me. This movie has great actors (minus, of course, Lindsay Lohan - dear God, why her?) whose acting talent is all but wasted. Lohan is disasterously cast as the angst-ridden teenage daughter who wears ripped jeans and writes poems about suicide. (Couldn't there be just one movie containing a teenager that is not a stock character?) It does not contain the monologue (it's been a quiet week in my hometown of Lake Wobegon) that has made Keillor famous. Nor, does it ultimately even make much sense. I could go on, but I won't. Don't watch it unless you're light of head/wallet, or don't mind being bored or disappointed."
2,It's a Radio Show,"I don't think there is any way that this folksy, charming radio show could ever make the successful transition to film. The main part of it's charm is the fact that it's on the radio. I agree with a prior reviewer that you will be hard pressed to keep your finger off the FF on your remote. Unless you enjoy listening to actors singing some very lame folksy jingles, I would suggest avoiding this. The story involving Kevin Kline as a film noir detective and Virginia Madsen as the angel of death was nothing more than a failed attempt to make this more cinema friendly."
1,They reek - like formaldehyde,"I took these for about a week, but couldn't get past the smell as soon as you open the bottle (I even got rid of the packet inside that absorbs moisture but the smell stayed as strong as ever).I wanted to gag every time I took them. I ordered three bottles, and all smell the same. I'm returning them and cancelling the subscription."
5,arnette Deuce Italian Polarized Sunglasses,Great looking and greating fitting sunglasses. I use them daily and when i am playing tennis.They reduce the glare and make every thing look crisp and clear. I love them! Rhonda Young
1,More Pablum from the Queen of Schmaltz,"Listening to these pieces, it is clear Ms Boyd did not play her way to the top. Some other activity, perhaps? Her extreme and, in most cases, inappropriate use of rubato leaves one to wonder if she simply does not remember the duration of the notes. Surely she cannot be that bad at interpretation? Her choice of repertory is also suspect, as nearly all of it consists of ""encore"" style pieces: you know, flashy but simple, something to go home humming, but lacking any real substance. As for her own compositions, ho hum, who cares?"
3,ok pants,These are adequate for work and dressier casual situations. I will probably get more in different colors when I have more money.
2,doen't help at all,"I got this for my three year old daughter, thinkling it would help get her on two wheels. Now at not quite five she is riding by herself, but this product didin't help at all. I thought I could grab the handle and help if she was falling, but that thwarts the normal ballancing motions she makes. i also hoped to give her a push up hills with this, but again, it knocks her down. She liked the ballance bikes with no pedals, and that's what I'd reccomend over this."
3,Ginger overpowering...,"I find the ginger to be pretty overwhelming in this tea. If you like ginger tea though then I guess that's not a problem. Prior to this I had Celestial Seasonings red tea, it was sweet and very relaxing. I drink this one small sips at a time. Don't want to return it and it's not so bad that I want to just toss it all away, but the flavor of this tea, which I think is really what helps relaxes you, just doesn't do it for me. Doesn't make me feel calmer or more relaxed, sorry to say =/"
5,The ONLY tea for me!,"Such a GREAT buy, and since I have a cup or two a day, you can't beat the price either!"
2,Lemon Fresh Pine Sol,"This tea tastes like Lemon Fresh Pine Sol. Or at least, it smells like Lemon Fresh Pine Sol, and it tastes the way it smells. I guess I can't actually say it tastes like Pine Sol since I've never actually drank Pine Sol. I gave it one star for tasting like an industrial grade cleaning solution, and one more since it deserves credit for not burning my throat the way I assume true cleaning solvents would. On the plus side, though, it has catnip in it so if you have hyper cats, it might relax them."
5,Excellent replacement converter,"The catalytic converter on my Suburban was ""missing"" and the exhaust smell etc. was ridiculous. I ordered this after reading other reviews and it does exactly what it supposed to. The exhaust is no longer stinky and it appears to breath well as I have seen no change in performance in my motor. I have this behind a Chevy ZZ4 Performance 350 with headers etc. and it works great!"
3,Universal says at all,"It's an universal cat, so don't expect it to fit perfectly, the SEL did go off. used it for an 2005 chevy Astro Van, lot's of adaptations. it's leaking a little air but that is my mechanic crap work's fault."
3,Nostalgic trip,"I never missed the column when my dad's ""Saturday Evening Post"" arrived back in the '50's or early '60's. This compilation is a blast back to that day.The author resets major and minor league umpire challenges, some of them really odd, into major league teams of the day, which means the reader gets a reminder of the players and stadia of the day.The answers are of course based on the baseball rule book of that time too, so shouldn't be taken to apply today. Not necessarily, anyway. All in all, a fun read.The illustrations are uncredited in the text, but signed by Willard Mullin. First rate illustrations and another reason to want the book.Product quality--at your own risk. It was a Fawcett Gold Medal book, original price $0.50, and not built to last. It's a used paperback, so.... Mine was readable, and I bought it for the content, not the package."
1,Where is it?,I can not review this because I still have not recieved it. I have been in touch with the seler but still have not gotten it.
3,Lots of pictures and not very organized or practical,"This book is for the young bodybuilder dreamers and not for the realist. You definitely need anabolic stearoids to reach the results pictured. Nice review of exercises but the organization of the book makes it difficult to find practical advice. There are a lot of ""sample"" exercise programs of the ""superstars"" but they are so variable that you don't get much useful information. If you like a lot of pictures of semi-naked weightlifters then buy this book, but if you want practical advice, look elsewhere."
3,Poorly documented.,"Weider suggested obsolete routines, especially for the novice bodybuilders. He did not include any chest exercise for the last three months of training."
5,Fascinating and yet impossible NOT to believe.,"This book is out of print. But it is one of the best on the subject of the frontiers of human psychic powers such as teleportion, levitation, and black magic. The author's experiences and anecdotes about his travels through Africa, Haiti, Indonesia, etc. definitely have the ring of truth. Especially for an expat like myself residing in Indonesia, I have come to understand that people in other cultures focus their human abilities based on a different set of priorities than Westerners"
2,Melanie just needed money,"It's sad that after being so many years looking for some pop-rock credibility , Mel ends up doing this kind of crappy version of I want candy.The mariachi trumpets just sound ridiculous and absolutely spoil the whole song. Go back to your best singles Mel (going down, here it comes again) and forget about trying to be sexy and cheesy."
4,Page-Turner,"The only weakness I found in this story was a small section about halfway through the book where the killer's identity became obvious. Had that paragraph been written a bit more subtly, and a few more red herrings thrown in, I would've been completely surprised and given the book 5 stars.This was my first book by this author, and I've already ordered the rest of her stuff. I hope it's as good as this one."
1,Spider-Man: Amazing Spider-Man,We ordered this productSpider-Man: Amazing Spider-Man [VHS] through Bearbooks. We received this itemThe Amazing Spider-Man: The Origin of Spider-Man & The Kilowatt Kaper [VHS]. Big difference. The covers aren't even close to the same.
3,Fond memories,"I remember watching this when I was at school and loving it, mind you watching now I am reminded how 70's it looks. I was a huge fan of the comics and although Aunt May is in it as is the daily Bugle this tv movie was world's away from the comics. Having said that Nicholas Hammond plays a very nervous Peter Parker and is great in the role, the martial arts sequences are extremely entertaining. This is lots of fun."
5,Stranger in the City,"I first bought Stranger in the City as an L.P. record in 1977 and over the years since then i have some how lost it,i decided i would get hold of a C.D. of it, i was unable to get a copy in England U.K.I received a copy from Amazon in a matter of days and Stranger in the City sounds as fresh now as it did back in 1977."
2,Too disco era,"I got this CD expecting similar sound as the Rebel album or More Miles Per Hour but all this artist all fell in the same trap Disco era In order to survive they needed to compose music to be use in disco if not no one wont ever listen so as Queen, Rolling Stone even Yes fell in the Disco era John Miles did with this Album NO GOOD"
4,Good Book For Chapter 7,"If you are looking for a good introduction to Chapter 7 for individuals, this is a good book. For information about Business Reorganizations, I recommendChapter 11 Business Reorganizations: For Business Leaders, Accountants And Lawyers"
4,simplified!!,Gives details about the subject and easy to understand.Leaves you less frightened by the whole ordeal.
2,defective,I bought the Vegetta for my nephew. When he got it out of the box he realized one of his arms was backwards!!! After paying about $50 for an action figure you expect quality has been checked.
3,"Witty and fun, but hard to keep clean.","I love the rules which are from a chi's perspective and the picture is also endearing, but the white surface gets gray looking quickly and, so far, I have been unable to find any product that will clean it. If I could make it look clean, I'd be giving the product five stars."
5,a must read,Very interesting characters and the development of each is very strong & intriguing...Really catches your interest from beginning to end...Extremely well written....Looking forward to future work by this up and coming writer...Lolita Sams
4,It comes together...,"I felt that this book needed to be written after reading ""Sister Secrets."" I had so many questions and ""Beyond..."" answered them. I enjoyed this book. The characters were scaled down and you could become more interested in them. I liked these people and and wanted good to come of them. I was glad that this author went back and gave us clarification on some of the older characters from ""Sister Secrets."" This book kept me interested. in the outcome of each person. Good job."
2,Not so Rebellious,Not as good as the reviews. Action is not well done and well below what I expected.
5,A must-See!,"I thought it was just a typical, Hong kong-style Martial arts movie when I rented it from Blockbuster and it rocks! I've never watched any Vietnamese movies before until The Rebel and it totally exceeded my expectations!This movie feels like a big production despite its small budget. Besides the fight scenes, the story and the acting are all good. Many kudos to the lead actress who deserves recognition for her acting.I'm gonna purchase this movie because it's a keeper."
4,Good movie,"I love martial art movies, so naturally I wanted to check this one out. In the end, I was surprised at how involved in the story I had become; the action scenes became bonuses. It's an awesome well rounded movie, which I would definitely recommend to anyone."
5,The Best supplement for Rifts,"The Japan World book is what every Rifts world book should have been; a succinct and enthralling manual that brings everything poetic about Japan together. Whether you think of Japan as a land of Samurais and Shoguns, Ninjas and demons, or megacities and beaurocrats, Siembieda has included it all in this book. I haven't had a chance to run a campaign in Japan yet, but I hope I get one; it would be a crime to waste such a richly drawn setting."
3,You get what you pay for,"I was very excited when I saw this Electric pump for just $45 but you get what you pay for. It has great sucktion but the speed is extremely slow and very little milk gets into the bottle. Not because it can't suck but because it is totally sealed. Think of a straw that can hold water when you have your finger over one end - that is like this pump. With pumping your breast and the bottle totally seals off the valve and no milk drips through which makes the 3 way bottle adapter fill with milk and back up into the pump. As soon as you release your breast from sucktion to milk drips down into the bottle but really - how often do you want to do that? It must be a design flaw and I'm hoping they fix it. The 3-way bottle adapter is great though - it fits with our gerber, medela and advent bottles - not with our playtex one though. If you are looking for a pump I'd advise not to get this one - get a nice hand pump or spend a little more and get the medela electric."
2,first years natural comfort,"Unfortunately, I have two of these pumps. Both of which are broken. The first one worked well for two months; however, milk backs up into the pump and you have continually keep pulling it off. Then of course, the motor burns out. The second I have worked for exactly two weeks before the same thing happened.Save your money for something else especially since these are not returnable. Your better off using a manual pump."
1,Garbage,"This pump is worthless, I bought it right before I went back to work and three weeks into it the pump stopped working. When I tried to get my money back from First Years they want me to go through all this trouble shooting everytime I want to use it. I am pumping on my lunch break, like I have time to go through that. DO NOT BUY, YOU ONLY GET FRUSTRATED!"
2,What a waste!,"I had the AVENT manual pump when I had my first daughter and it worked really great. Too bad it didn't work with my second daughter. My nipple got stuck on the connector and it is so painful. I decided to get this one because my friend adviced me to get this one. It worked fine at first except the noise, but then it started acting weird. The liquid went up caused leaking and then it started making a noise like you need to change the battery while I'm using the adaptor. After several use, I totally lost the suction. I tried to put it all the way up to get more suction, but I still don't feel any pressure. I'm so over with this pump and ready to dump it! Don't waste your money for this pump."
2,same as other reviews,Bought this pump thinking it was a great valua but you do get what you pay for. Same thing happened to mine that happened to the others that reviewed it. Back up of milk in the three way and loss of suction after about a month or so of use :( I wouldn't by another. I recommended it to my sister after I first got it and she got stuck with a bummer too :(
3,3 and a quater stars.,"I agree with D. A. Fortney on this one. This is not a Transilvanian Hunger, dark and dismal LP. It's a lighter Darkthrone than we've seen before with a very catchy punk edge to them. I personally enjoy this release though. ""Too Old, Too Cold"" is an amazing song...as well as a few others too. Still, I'd say it's on the mediocre side...nothing to be blown away by...but I've never been blown away by Dakrthrone anyhow. It's good and catchy, but doesnt make me shake.Overall, it sounds more like something you'd hear in the background of a movie scene where a few people are getting high while partying or something. I dont say that in a bad way though. It just sounds to me like thats where you'd find one of these songs. And it's one of Darkthrone's better LP's. So it isnt horrible."
1,punkish bm,"I am sorry but Darkthrone after reinventing black metal at the beginning of the 90's has turned into a punkish band, that has no more ideas to bring forth. I mean we are not in 1977 and though black metal is a sort of mixture containing punk, metal, death, satan, sadness, depression, hate and blastbeats, to reduce it to mere punk is a sign of lack of ideas. This is an altar to the cult of punk and it has nothing that touches my sad heart. You have lost a fan, Fenriz & co."
4,"If you Plan on Trolling in an inflatable, this works... however..","This Motor is good! However... If you buy an inflatable Sevylor boat (Which work great) and plan to use this motor for cruising around, you will be disappointed. On ""fast"" speed, the motor travels at about the pace of a slow average walk. If you are out using this motor for fishing, this is however about the right pace. One advantage of this motor is it only draws a maximum of 12 amps at the fastest pace. It will run the small accessory batter (another option to buy) for a solid 45 minutes. I bought a Large Everlast battery, which will be able to run the motor for SIX HOURS! For the Price... I would advise spending a little more cash and buying a trolling motor with 24lbs thrust or more"
3,Sevylor trolling motor,I find my new Sevylor 12 lbs. thrust motor is a good value for what I paid. A good performer on my 6' rubber raft with two adults and some gear. It's really light weight so packing into backcountry is possible.
5,Excellent album for everyone,"I had heard of Joel in the bass world but never knew his talents extended so far into the realm of producer, arranger, and writer. I picked this album up a few weeks ago and I can't seem to get the tunes out of my head! Everyone should give it a listen...well done Joel!"
1,item not arrived,How can I write about something that I have paid for but not received? And it's the second time.I don't know why.
4,Le Chevalier d'Eon,"This is one of the better Anime that I have seen in a long time .The visual look of this Anime feels as you are in France,with the play of historical real people and fiction you get a history lesson in a Anime.I recommend this to anyone its more of a adult Anime but anyone who has to take world history may enjoy it it made me go back and do some research on France."
1,Order got cancelled by vendor ( a vendor using the Amazon website),"I ordered the book. Without warning the order was canceled several days later. So this is really not a review of that book. I never got it. I am dissapointed in that the wonderful price promised was not to be had. Perhaps the book was sold to another person.When I put that in writing, the vendor offered to give me a huge discount if I removed my prior negative review.So, there you have it. The vendor did try to help me out in a fashion."
5,Great!,"Top product! Really thin, lot of space, perfect small size, great for travel, perfect protection for the files, great quality!"
1,"I tried, I really tried.","Being impressed with Oliphant's alter-ego A. J. Orde's Jason Lynx series, with wonderful characters, ingenious plots, and added info on antiques, I looked forward to Shari S. Tepper's third persona, in Dead in the Scrub. But first came a diatribe against those who oppose abortion. I am pro-choice (and pro-child), but it went on a bit long. Then irritation against in-your-face religious folk, where a little would have sufficed. Next obsessing against women who see themselves as fashion dolls. Yes, I appreciate quirkiness in viewpoint characters, and confess to be opinionated myself. But what should have been a sprinkling came to the point of irritation. I discarded the book even before the promised second murder.Reading others's high praise, I should try another title -- perhaps the first in the series was a shake-down cruise with others more to the point.But I expected more."
1,Disappointing,"Dyer is a great essayist. On the evidence of this book, he is not a great novelist. What I thought profound, insightful and funny in wonderful prose in his non-fiction, is here tedious, vapid and pedestrian. I'll try another novel, but this was most off-putting. A pity."
