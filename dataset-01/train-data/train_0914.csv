5,I pretty much love this cd.,"This cd is my mom's, and I listen to it more than her! I'm even listening to it right now! This is one of the cds I listen to and like the most. Every single song is good! I absolutely *love* the songs ""Secret Life"" and ""Need to Die."" A lot of the songs on this cd have really good messages, such as the lyrics in ""Unlearn"" and ""Need to Die"" (or at least that's how I interpret them). All of the songs are really catchy. Other rock fans like me might find at least a little something in this electronica album, since the songs ""Eye of the Mind,"" ""Ride,"" and ""PGP"" all have some electric guitar in them, even though none of the songs are really heavy. But I probably like this cd more than any other rock fan, because you won't believe the actual range of musical taste I have! I recommend you, no matter what music you like, to give this cd a try.Sincerely,Music fan."
3,Good Watch,"The actual watch face is great. I love it simply because it isn't to bulky and its not to small. I got it in the mail yesterday, and opened it up immediately to see how it fit. The band is absolute CRAP! The minute I put it on it started to push into my skin. I ended up just making a band out of paracord simply because I have found paracord bracelets more comfortable than any watch band, but that is just me. Its nothing fancy, just something to tell you the time."
1,worst watch ever!!!,The watch did not work when it arrived. I put in a new battery and it worked for a few hours and stopped. All this happened in less than 24 hours. What a rip off and I will never buy from this seller again.
2,Disappointing,Avoid. I love Bill Nelson. I mean I really love him. But this is really old stuff from his pre-Be Bop Deluxe days and it has aged incredibly. This is due to the time it was produdced. The man has gone on to produce some fantastic stuff that should be investigated instead.
3,"Fun, Messy and a bit disappointing","Our nine-year old enjoyed both the ""dig"" and the process of examining the yield. Definitely messy - we did it outside - and somewhat challenging given the ""tool"" which is essentially a plastic knife. Ultimately used a brass-bristle brush which was effective. She was outraged by the claim of a ""genuine emerald"" which was simply a glass bead; calling into question the legitimacy of all statements associated with the product. Dropping the false claim(s) would actually strengthen the product, the customer satisfaction, and likelihood of recommending it to others."
1,Not As Advertised!!!,"Our son just got this product for Christmas and was very excited to begin excavating for the items shown on the box label. Imagine our suprise when what actually is found is nothing at all like the labeling. The size of the items is miniscule compared to the box pictures and there was definitely no ""genuine emerald"" in the rock. This toy took approximately 30 minutes to ""investigate"" and the ""tools"" that it came with were not of a very high quality. Save your money and try a different approach!"
3,patience needed,The premise is great but I think most kids just don't have the amount of patience needed for this. You have to dig the stuff out which is VERY messy(think muddy and dusty) and time consuming. However they will be rewarded.
3,Takes a lot of patience.....,"I gave this to my 7 year old. He was very excited at first and so was I. It turns out that you will have to scrape the surface of this rock very, very hard and patiently, just like the real thing I guess, and we never had enough patience to get to any rock before this rock was put away. Also it is a very dusty job and that makes me not want my son to keep on scraping because he is inhaling this dust, I guess you could wear a dust mask, and that can never be good. Also there is a label on the box warning that some rocks might contain lead.....so if you are also worried about that this is not a good toy."
2,this was very hard to do,"I bought this for my 4 year old grandson, he loves finding treasures, but we found the dirt in our rock to be so hard to dig that even the adults couldn't manage it, forget even trying the small brush that was provided. We finally wet the dirt and dug in the mud, the rocks and gems were fairly nice once we got them out, but the digging experience just wasn't there. Everything the digging rock and the gems you find were a little smaller than I had expected."
2,Too Hard to find treasures,My daughter got this toy when she was 6. It is very difficult and time consuming to uncover the treasures. As a matter of fact the tools have started to wear out before we got even the 2nd treasure out. She works on it every once in a while but has generally given up. So have we.
3,I never got to see the rock.,"My son got this for Christmas because he absolutely loves digging and looking for ""gems"" and ""treasures"" in the yard. He awoke Christmas morning at 4:00 am ready to open his presents. Needless to say after he opened everything I told him to go back to bed and wake up in a couple of hours to play with his stuff but he couldn't. I woke up two hours later with a kitchen table full of dirt and a kitchen sink full a mud. Apparently somewhere between 4 AM and 6 AM my son though of putting it in the sink to get the ""gems"" out. He got them out alright it took him no more than an hour but he's very proud of the gems he found!I wish I would have been able to see the rock. All I can say is that is comes with a log book so the child can write about the ""excavation"" a plastic chisel like tool and a paint brush. We had no need for it because my son managed to get 9 stones out (1 was lost to the drain I guess)."
5,Red Hot Kat Lady,"Out of all the reds I've used to color my hair, and I've used many, Red Penny is the one that got me the most compliments... perhaps really the only compliments. After using other reds, I'm going back to this one. It's hot, but very natural."
3,"Okay, but.....","I like the series. I have them all, but... I dunno. I hated that I was reading it, but at the same time, I couldn't put it down. I gets really, really cheesy at times and it was all I could do to throw the book out! I couldn't stand it, but-again- I couldn't put it down! If u can get these books cheap or free, then I guess you should read them, but I wouldn't recomend these books at all. Don't go looking for these, it's not worth it."
5,A Rewie of The whole series,"Personally, i think and thousands of others would agree that Heartland is on of the most truly fanstastic book seris ever writtin. They contain, adventure,romance,fear, family and achivenments. Each book that has been writtin so far suits any kind of mood or feeling and is writting in a fantastily realistic way.Amy as a charater is strong, happy, beautiful and kind, the best heroin a book could want. By the way, She is SO lucky in The sixths book(you'll have to read it to find out why!)Ty is Soo Perfect!!!. A turly fantastic seris. I have read books 1-17 and ccant wait to read no 18+19!!"
4,Heartland Coming Home,"This is about a girl who loved horses, and her mother owned a ranch called ""Heartland"". They take care of and help any type of horse. One day they went to rescue a horse and her mom died from getting hit by a falling tree. Amy is left to save Heartland.I think this story is really good. It reminds me of my life because I take care of horses. I also think that Amy will safe Heartland and be just like her mother. Also I think Amy and Ty will get together. I would recommend this book to people because this story is sad and truthful about life."
3,Like it except....the bad words,"I liked this book okay. It's about a girl named Amy who's Mom owns a horse farm that helps injured horses. Then Amy's Mom dies. I could really relate to Amy and Lou, her sister. However, I didn't like how there were so many bad words though..."
4,what do I think?,"Coming home is about a girl called Amy who lives on a horse farm and helps her mum 2 heal horses, with the help of the stable hand Ty (hooray!) tragedy strikes and Amy realizes stuff, learns somthing aboutt herself ect. It is a well written occasionally cheesy book, better than your average horse book. This isn't lauren brooke's best book though, they get better as they go on"
4,sad but great.....,"This book is great, but really sad. Fifthteen year-old Amy loves horses, she even has a ranch where she takes care of them! But on on one stormy night her mother and her go out to rescue a horse and a tree hits there car, hwer mother dies but Amy is O.K! Amy gets very sad, they start to lose money and almost lose the ranch! Can they save the ranch, you will have to find out, i hope you read this book!"
5,Heartland Series by Lauren Brooke,"As a retired teacher and when I was teaching I often would read childrens books to make sure they were appropriate for my class. I loved this series so much that I have been buying the series so my grandchildren can read them. #1 ""Coming Home"" reduced me to tears and totally made this old lady a fan of the books. Thanks Lauren Brooke for writing them."
5,"Listen, they are special.","Heartland is a number one book. The story is a about a young horse whisperer discovering her talents. The girl, Amy is saddened greatly by her mom's death. She clings on to the horses. When a shetland pony is found wanting to die Amy must use all her talent to bring him back. As it says on the cover, Healing horses, healing hearts."
5,Best book ever!,"The book Heartland: Coming Home, is the best book i've ever read before! I think this is an awesome book. If you read it there is no doubt you wont like it! Right now I'm on my way to the second Heartland!Enjoy it!"
3,Girl from the top likes to get dirty.,"Cat has it all, good job, successful boyfriend, powerful friends...and a little craving for a man in a hard hat, and that taste fo the dirty and rough she can only get from him. Cat has been having an affair for some time, but things get sticky when her fling starts working for the sucessful boyfriend. When it all shakes down, what will she choose, the good livin' or great lovin'? This book has some of the usual Black Lace requires scenes, which are always hot. The characters are interesting, if occasionally flat. the plot is pretty interesting and consistant. And I LOVE the cover...! This is a good BL buy."
5,Absolutely Sizzling,"This is a very sexy story from Black Lace's Alison Tyler. Cat Harrington leads a double-life. A script doctor with a successful engineer boyfriend, she engages in a risky and risque relationship with the head of a road crew. Brock is a rough-and-ready type who fulfills her sensuous cravings for honest, skin-on-skin sex. He's good-looking. And sexy. And built. Better yet, Brock likes her when she's dirty, while everyone in Cat's world expects her to be clean.Before Cat can make her decision about which man is right for her, her boyfriend is promoted. His position puts him directly in charge of her lover. Now, Cat is about to learn something about herself-something about her boyfriend-and something about workmen.None of the scripts Cat works on are as twisted as the one her life has become! This is a hot, hot book!"
3,"""Caution: B&W Copy of Colorful Original""","I like Nigel Cook's technical writing style and have enjoyed his other electronics textbooks from Prentice Hall. They have typically been top-quality binding, excellent color printing & graphics, on high-quality non-yellowing paper. Exercise CAUTION in your consideration of purchasing this edition: IT IS A B&W COPY OF THE ORIGINAL, on what appears to be high-grade Xerographic paper, with NO color anything... pix, graphics, titles, etc. I am very disappointed that the book description does not highlight this fact. The price should be adjusted accordingly."
4,Mostly works,"I did see a dramatic reduction in the number of the little roaches that were running around my apartment (according to the property manager, they've sprayed several times without success), but once in a while I still catch one. I'm guessing the other apartments have it worse than I do. I was also a little worried about having this around my cats, but there hasn't been a problem."
1,doesn't work!,"more and bigger roaches, product doesn't work at all. I placed all units in the kitchen and bathroom. No results at all,roaches are getting much bigger and coming out during the day time.Also, note the opennings are too small for big roaches."
2,This doesn't work!!,"I bought this in the hope that it would stop roaches from crawling in my kitchen.For a few days, it seemed like it worked.However, I have been unpleasantly surprised that I still see small roaches in my kitchen! That is disheartening and disgusting.This product sucks!"
4,what is the perfect prize?,"This is the first Susan Howatch book I have read. I was fascinated with the intertwining of Anglican church history and the problems of a clergyman, his struggles to come to term with his past and the secular idea of chasing and obtaining life's ultimate prizes. The soul searching of Neville Ayesgarth and his reponses to those around him, and those trying to help him were most realistic and made for that type of book that you are anxious to get back to and then read other in the series."
4,An amazing band,I saw this band at the X-trials in Louisville four years ago and they absolutely brought the house down. Theyre sound is a mix of early incubus and 311 and they carry that sound very well. This band hasent made it into the spotlight yet but its only a matter of time before they make it. With catchy songs and guitar leads (whoo hoo) this cd is definetely worth the money
5,Christmas is a special day,"This Cd is one of fats last master pieces, great cd christmas in a typical fats domino style wonderfull classic's like Jingle bells and ofcourse Frosty the snowman are wonderfull done by Fats,"
2,eh.,"I found this manga very difficult to follow, the story was not as good as I had hoped it would be."
3,"A review of Ouran High School Host Club, vol. 1","When scholarship student Haruhi steps into the supposedly unused music room, hoping to get some studying done, she discovers the Ouran High School Host Club. The club entertains female students with teas, parties, conversation, and lots of drama. They also happen to think that Haruhi is a boy and, when she accidentally break an $80,000 vase, they demand that she repay them by working for the club.I liked this manga, but it took me awhile to get into it. It's goofy, manic, and a little confusing, but I think that as the first volume goes on, the characters get nailed down and are a bit more defined. There's a great moment where a fangirl is ""casting"" each member of the club in their stereotype. Haruhi isn't quite what I expected... she's tough, capable of holding her own, and sees through a lot of the acts in the club. I'm not all that attached as of yet, but we'll see how I feel about the next volume."
4,A nice sample of Kirk's music.,"This album is a good companion to Kirk's ""The Number of Magic""-- less dancefloor-oriented than some of his other releases. It contains his signature groove voodoo, but has some songs that approach a more ambient style."
4,Awesome product,I liked this product a lot when I used it first time. I bought this for my dad from a duty free shop at amestrdam airport. Costed me much higher what Amazon has priced it for me. The smell is very unique and fresh. try it and see the difference...
5,Good purchase!!,"I was low on perfumes so i decided to buy this cool water game. Turned out to be a great buy. Smells great, lasts long. It's the type of perfume you could use on a daily basis."
1,I never received the product,This product never arrived at my shipping address and I don't find the way to file a claim in this case.
5,Exactly what I ordered just like the pic,Installed on a 07 sport trac to replace the original works great Not the same as the oem though but will work.
3,Noisy and wonderful,"Autechre is an acquired taste, but one well worth acquiring. Too noisy and off-centered to really be ""ambient,"" the sounds are rich and reward attention. Incunabula, though not as powerful as Amber, is a strong recording; its rhythms and beats will keep you listening even if you're not a noise fan."
4,Darn near perfect,"I don't have much complaints about this album. It Autechre's humble beginnings... but even being their beginnings, the still made a masterful album. 11 tracks of gloomy ambience await you here. Sure some tracks stand above others, but as a whole this is a really impressive album that will grow on you the more you listen. Autechre only went on to make bigger and better production from here."
4,BEAUTIFUL TEXTURES,"Nothing here gripped me in the same way as my two favorite Autechre tracks ""Eutow"" and ""Chatter"" but this album is on the whole, melodic and enjoyable and reminds me in parts of Beaumont Hannant's Woven Textures. Autriche with its disembodied, floating voices is very evocative, whilst Bronchus impresses too with its atmospheric buildup, something like a virtual thunderstorm. They make the most of their unusual repertoire of sounds on Incunabula to deliver perhaps their most accessible album that would be perfect for a sci-fi movie soundtrack."
2,Average ambient techno,"Caught a track of this on Yahoo's Launch and read the positive reviews here, so I picked up the CD. After listening to the full CD a few times, the album is average at best. Most of the pieces sound alike, and get fairly repetitive before moving to the next bit in the piece. In the end I was pretty disappointed. I didn't even bother to rip the tracks for my iPod. I would pass on it."
5,So simple a girl can use it!,"After the check engine light turned on, I decided to buy this scanner instead of taking it to a mechanic shop and spending more money. It worked great and was very simple to use (and I am a girl). I have no regrets... worth every penny!"
4,Equuis 3030 easy to use,"This product can pay for itself very quickly if you can read the codes to your vehicle and get a basic understanding of waht they mean. The reason is that you can let your repair guy know up front that you have some knowledge of whats going on so you are less likely to get hosed. This code reader is a nice value, and was worth every penny. I know there are more sophisticated and expensive code readers out there, but this one did the job for me at a nominal price. Shortly after purchasing this item, my '2002 Ford Mustang developed an engine skip. The code reader traced it to cylinder # 3 hopefully just a bad wire. I took the car to the dealer, and let them know that I had a pretty good handle on what was going on. My bill ended up being pretty cheap."
5,Excellent OBDII reader!,"Excellent product! A breeze to use. Just plug it in and let it do its thing. The ""service engine soon"" light came on right before my road trip and I needed to know if it was something I should worry about. It turned out to be an oxygen sensor. Not too much of a big deal and I was able to repair it myself. The Equus 3030 paid for itself immediately."
3,NO INSTRUCTIONS - NO CD as shown,"This monitor comes in a blister pack, with NO instructions, NO CD (as shown) and no place to start.There is a PC cable with it. Once you find the Innove web site. the download for instructions is 36 pages long. so have lots of ink and paper ready. Read the instructions carefully so you understand all the icons that show up (or down't show) for your vehicle.When the 1st monitor was lost by UPS, Amozon was on the ball with another one shipped quickly. BUT there is NO 800 number for Amozon, and there is no customer service to help you get thru your problems."
4,Easy to use,"The Honda Odyssey check engine light was on. The dealer wants to charge me $80 to read the code. Auto Zone no longer let you borrow their code reader for free. After some research, for the price and functions, I bought this one. It works perfectly. Pulled out the code immediately. I googled the code and found out I only need to change the gas tank cap. Keep it in your tool box. You will need it if you have a car. You get your our money back by using it once.The only reason I reduced 1 star is the shipping took 8 days. Too long for even free shipping."
2,not all I expected,Have not had it very long. Can't get information on the coad it brings up. You have to buy the information on repairs.
5,"No problems, sturdy unit, excellent display, easy to use","I bought this unit because I found out that when I took the my car recently to the dealer to have it diagnosed for the engine missing that all they did was to hook it up to a OBDII reader. The dealer charged me $88 to do this. After replacing the spark plugs and wires, I put the unit into the OBDII reader and I no longer have any codes present. Although I did not use the unit to diagnose the spark plug/wires issue, I will be able to do this myself and potentially save another 88 bucs."
5,Awesome,"Works perfectly with my 3rd generation (2008) Hyundai Accent. Plugs in and within 5 seconds it had the codes ready. The Equus 3030 has I/M Readiness Monitors which are AWESOME. It'll let you know precisely if you'll pass your emissions inspection (unless your area has visually inspected emissions, which it obviously can't tell you). Worth every penny. :D"
5,Future Proof,"This is what it is and does what it does. It is a basic bare bones code reader (doesn't give you any live telemetry data) but has the advantage of being future proof. This is one of the most affordable code readers that works with the older On-Board Diagnostics (OBDII) and the newer Controller-area network (CAN or CAN-bus). CAN has been in use by some car manufacturers since the 1990's but as of 2008 all new cars sold in the U.S. are required to use CAN. Both protocols use the same type of connector on most cars. Even if you have a car that is OBDII don't be tempted to save a few bucks on an OBDII only reader; you're bound to have a CAN type car in the future.It is well made, the LCD and status lights are highly readable and the controls are simple and easy to learn. Amazon is shipping the updated 3030a model that is virtually the same as the one pictured except for a slightly different button placement and a newer processor that apparently is more compatible with all car manufacturers."
2,Problems out of thebox,"I purchased this scanner and hooked it up to my Subaru 2002 forester. It didn't work. When I called the company, they immediately knew of the problem, and told me I would need to ship the code reader back to them to have the chip re-programmed. Best part is that they want me to pay the shipping! Innova should really recall all their 3030 scanners and fix them, or offer free shipping to have them reprogrammed. It might work for many other cars, but the Subaru is OBDII compliant, and the code reader should work out of the box."
2,Equus 3030 Erase Function,"The ERASE function does not work on my Toyota Avalon 1997. Tried several methods in addition to the one in the manual, NO SOAP RADIO. Otherwise, it is a handy reader. My mechanic says this model needs to be unplugged after a read for an accurate refresh - I thought it refreshed ok, maybe he had a model with old firmware. I just know for certain that, with the latest firmware, it can't ERASE the codes and therefore CANNOT TURN-OFF THE CHECK LIGHT. I tried contacting Innova by email, no response. I think it was worth the price as a reader, but I want a fully functional OBDII scanner and eraser."
4,Equus 3030 innova,"Good Code reader, easy to use and precise, I have an 1998 infiniti I30 and was trying to find a problem with the emissions, it appears someone had pulled the air temp sensor plug off and had forgotten to reinstall, well this machine gave me the code and I started looking for any loose connection and sure enought found the loose plug. The only bad thing is the website, the Company gives you six analysis and then you have to wait a month, very dumb, it should be indefinite."
2,Buy ACRON instead,"I bought this product thinking it will work on my 2005 SUZUKI, but i was wrong. It reads error. It works on my American made cars thou. I emailed the manufacturer, and send the registration card as well, but no response back from them whatsoever.Bad product, bad company..avoid buying this scanner."
3,disappointed,"I bought this device to reset my ""check engine"" light which comes on in error. Although the device has a clear operation, it did not clear the light. I called customer support and they said the problem was in the car's computer - oh well"
2,Not what I wanted,"I guess I ordered the wrong tester and it did not meet my needs. I returned it back to Amazon and had no problems with the return. I then ordered the innova 3100 and this tool is great. Amazon is a great place to order from, and I recommend them to everyone"
4,Obd2 tester,"Great product, only downside is ot doesnt have a codes manuel n we had a hard te downloading the codes manual. But u can google the code for your the device gives you for the maje n. model for your vehicle. Major plus is that it will yell u if your car will pads slog or not. As long as u have some type of internet (even if it's just in your phone) u are ok."
2,Major let down,This product seemed like a great deal...it came with a CD and let you believe you would get a thorough diagnostic review. You supposedly get a code plus can plug it into your computer and get a detailed report...NOT. You have to pay $15.00 PER CODE read to get a report on that code that means anything. You are much better off buying something more expensive that gives you the real deal. You can pull into any auto supply and they will give you the code for free with no additional info...just like this code reader.
1,ERROR on 2 common cars,"Got the dreaded ERROR message on a 2005 Escape, and again on a 2007 Corolla. Support suggested checking fuses and trying with car running. Fuses were fine. Tried it on one car while running (which is contrary to the instructions), again no joy. ARGH!"
3,Doesn't work with Mercedes CLS,"This reader works well with an Audi and GM cars that I've used it on. However eventhough the product data indicates this works on all cars, it would not clear the codes on a Mercedes CLS500. It could read them, but would say FAIL while trying to clear the codes and turn off the Check Engine Light."
5,Works Great,This told me what was wrong so the Dodge dealer could not lie to me. They fixed the problem under warrenty.
5,Great Product - Must have for any DIY mechanic,"My son's 1996 240sx got a check engine light. We were getting conflicting information from Autozone and the dealers about what was wrong (and how much it would cost to fix); so I bought this unit to see what was going on. The ability to see the stored codes is great, and the screen is very easy to read. We were able to find out what was wrong and we bought the part we needed. In total probably saved over $300 in 'recommended work' by the dealership.One feature of this unit which is very useful is the ability to see the 'readiness' status of the cars computer; you can see which systems (O2, Cat, Evaporative etc) have passed their internal readiness testing.This is an ideal unit for anyone that does their own work on cars."
1,Still does not work with Subaru Vehicles,"Shame on me. I should have read and believed some of the previous reviewers who had problems using this with their Subaru. It did not work on my 03 Subaru Forester. After connecting properly, it simply indicated 'error.' I had assumed from some reviews and other notes on the Web that this same model now had a different chip that worked with Subarus--not true. Had it worked, this model would have offered so much more for the price over an Actron. But I guess I will have to try an Actron now.Thank you to Amazon for making returns easy."
4,As Described...,"Does what it says it does. If you need to pull codes then it works great. Dont expect it to tell you what is causing your problem. Thats not how these work. For example; If you have a cylinder misfiring it will give you a code telling you what the problem is, but not what is causing that cylinder to be out"
3,Ok if you dont mind buying a subscription,"If you have three vehicles,then you need three subscriptions.It will give out codes for all your vehicles but will not decipher the codes for you unless you get a subscription which runs 19.99 month per vehicle or 59.99 a year per vehicle."
4,"I like it, no regrets here","Having once visited my dealer mechanic after my engine light came on, I decided I needed more information. Because when your engine light comes on, it could be one of a thousand different problems, and unless you have one of these, you have no idea. If your engine light comes on, it could also be nothing, as is what happened on the aforementioned visit to the dealer. It cost me about two hundred bucks to find out that nothing was wrong with my engine. This item is about a quarter the cost of that dealer visit.I am very pleased with the performance of this item. I plugged it in, it told me that my number 6 cylinder had misfired one time. Time for some new spark plugs. Then it turned the engine light off, so it is reset in the event of another problem. I used it on a 2001 Ford Escape with about 75k miles on it.If nothing else, this item will help keep your mechanic honest."
3,No bad for a DIY'er,"Overall not bad, easy to use. Cleared a code in my Mazda quite easily. Loaned it to a buddy with a 350Z at first got an error, then he tried it again and it read the code. It seemed like the code is not correct but in fact it was right. However it seemed to miss an airbag code. So for regular check engine lights this thing will help you out. For more in depth codes and air bag stuff look for a higher end scanner."
2,"Device is Ok, Software is nothing but Adware to sell you a service",The device successfully read engine codes from my 2004 Mitsubish Montero and my 2004 Hyundai Santa Fe. The software it comes with is just a frame to their website where they want you to sign up to a service.I was forced to take the engine codes provided by the device and google them outside of the device's software package to get any useful information.
3,This will not work on 06 or newer cars with CAN system,"I purchased this for my 2006 S2000. I plugged it in and I received an error code. I called Equus tech support and I was told that it will not work on 06-07 cars and they are making a new chip for it so it will. It will not be ready for 3 months or so. He said - if could wait the 3 months, I could send it in to have it replaced. I guess if you have an older car it would work just fine. It's going back to Amazon...."
1,You're buying a scam.,"Codes read from OBDII connection in your car have to be identified by the so-called Equus manufacturer, whether that be Equus, Innova, IEC, CanOBDII.com, or whatever other name they might be using at any time. They don't offer to let you print out the range of codes for your car. Instead, they provide the bare code info after you give them a mountain of info about yourself, including the VIN of your car, that you wouldn't want to give to strangers, but you want the information, say, for code P0303. Turns out it's ""Misfire."" Then they offer to tell you more for $15. Rather than buy this intro to a scam, just go to NAPA, Advance Auto, O'Reilly, Auto Zone or any other auto parts and get your code read free. Now, after throwing this thing away, I'm bracing for friendly solicitations from the thousand marketers they sell my info to."
4,Worth the cash!,"This item will not fix what causes the ""check engine"" light to glow on your dashboard, nor will the enclosed software give you much more info than what shows on the screen when you plug it in. (You can pay more to get more cause and remedy software info.) However, going to the web and looking up the codes and possible remedies, then walking in to the mechanic's forearmed with some knowledge will probably allow you to save a lot of overcharges. Mechanics aren't going to overcharge a knowledgeable-sounding customer near as much as the ""tell me what's wrong with my car"" innocent. I figure this was worth nearly $300 in savings compared to the previous episode of ""check engine."""
5,nice and easy,"when you have it in your hands feels cheaper that how it looks in the picture. However works as advertised, nice blue backlight, easy to use.All information listed on screen. Besides the defect code, icons showing all diferent systems reviewed. All icons explained in manual.I've had no need to use the computer software yet, with the information on screen and the defect description in the manual you can work it out with no problem at all."
5,Works as advertised,"I anticipated receiving this item in the mail with the free shipping. Finally, the day came where I got the package. I literally ran to my vehicle to see what the error was that triggered my CEL. I got a P0420 which indicates something amiss with the Catalyst system. Using the device, I erased the error and if it appears again, I know that the recent recall work didn't do what it was supposed to. This saved me the time of going to the dealership just to have them charge $80 to turn off the CEL! Highly recommended!"
2,"Works, But Very Fussy (Used on a VW)","Actually works, but fairly painful to use. Tech support responsive, but you have to ask questions that you should not have to ask, and spend time figuring out stuff you shouldn't have to.I recieved a 3030f, which is not supported on the website yet (prior model 3030e is). After having problems with my computer seeing the device, the tech emailed me some software which solved the problem.I was also having trouble linking up the device with my 2004 Passat. The manual (for the 3030e) said not to start the car, but the tech told me otherwise. I quote: ""European vehicles are very tricky. Most of the time, the vehicle has to be running first... THEN plug in the 3030f to get a reading.""Apparently a VAG COM Scan Tool is the key requirement for VWs (and Audis), which this device is not."
3,Is this long lasting?,"I used my Innova 3030 on two different cars and it worked great at first. Then the last times I used it it reads can't find code?\I did read up on this before I bought it and some people said that you only get truth reading the first few times only? Then it's no good any more. I will have to find some other car that has it's service engine light on to test it again. I will let you know how I made out, if I can do that?. If this don't read anymore I will wrap it up and send it back to seller, even if I had it for over a year. I don't play that. I would buy it if I was you. Dennis 560 in West Philly."
3,I CANNOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM FOR WICH I BOUGHT IT,THE SERVICE LIGHT REQUIRED OF MY VOLVO AND MBENZ HAD NOT BEEN POSSIBLE TO TURN OFF YET WITH THIS PRODUCT I BOUGHT
3,Diagnostic Code Reader,"The Equus Reader does a great job of reading the code for my 2001 Escape, but doesn't offer any diagnostic information on how the code can be fixed. Still have to take it to the dealer in order to fix the problem. The code can be erased/reset in order to shut off the engine light on certain code errors, but that still doesn't fix the overall problem, nor give any ideas to the owner of how to fix the problem. I'm a little disappointed."
5,EMISSIONS TIP,"Excellent product, what I like most is that there are no batteries required for these devices they draw power from the vehicles electrical system.This quickly and easily retrieves diagnostic codes and erases them to get that dreaded check engine light off. However, for emissions testing, the vehicle will fail the ODB readiness portion of the test if the history on your vehicle's computer is too short. After erasing the codes the vehicle must go through a drive cycle. My tester recommended driving 10 minutes at 55 mph WITHOUT GOING OVER 60mph, then turning around and driving another 10 minutes again at 55mph being sure not to exceed 60mph. If the check engine light remains off then your vehicle should pass emissions.UPDATE: This reader does test reediness. The icons representing each monitor will flash if not ready, if ready the the icons will appear, but won't be flashing. Also, drive cycles vary depending on your vehicle, do some googling there's a good bit of info available."
4,Equus 3030 Innova OBDII reader,"The product was everything I expected it to be. It is easy to use, the instruction manual was informative and provided the information needed to isolate and resolve the issue with my car. The only minor annoyance was the cd for on-line suggested repair solutions. It seemed more of a way to obtain information about my car than provide meaningful suggestions."
5,Outstanding!,I had the Check Engine light come on in my car ('05 Subaru) and motorcycle ('01 Triumph) within a week of each other. Plugging into the car revealed a code for Catalytic Converter under effeciency. I was surprized to find my 9 year old bike was OBD2 compliant but the reader plugged right in and gave me a code. Itwas a bad cooling fan relay. Only complaint (if you can call it that) was that the code sheet was in the downloaded manual not the enclosed documentation.
4,great help,"The tool is easy to operate and worked just advertised. Got codes for my Mazda truck and fixed the problem myself, probably saved over $100. Am now waiting for parts for my VW, the dealership wanted $85 just to run the test. I am very pleased."
5,Bang for buck,Awsome for the price and does its job great !Recommend it to anyone.It helped stopping investing in a car with major mecanical problems.
5,Equus 3030 saved me $$$$$,"1 week after my cars warrenty expired the check engine light comes on and stays on. After researching several code readers I picked the Equus 3030 mostly for price, there seemed to be little difference in function with most of the readers available. The 3030 worked perfectly, it read the code (which was nothing major) and let me reset the light. Saving me hundreds by going to the dealer."
3,"Works, poor documentation","I ordered this to check out a ""check engine soon"" light on my Pathfinder. The unit worked as advertised, and allowed me to read out the code and reset it.The device comes with a CD and a USB cable, but the documentation doesn't mention anything about hooking it to my laptop. I didn't need to do that, but it would have been nice to have some information on it."
2,Not working,"So far this product is not working correctly. I have tried it 3 different times on my Yukon and it is not doing anything. Have not tried it on other vehicles yet, but so far not to happy with it."
5,Great,I brought this for my husband and he loved it. I am going to buy him the upgraded version of this device.
3,INNOVA 3030,"It did not come with an instructions manual, or cd. I had to go waste time on line to figure the thing out. Also saw the same item @ local discount store for same price. The good was that it did help me solve the problem with my car."
1,It did not work on my Jetta 2007,"The check engine light lit. I checked with the Innova 3030 which detected nothing, lighting the green light telling that everything was OK. So I used my Vag 405 which detected cylinder misfire."
1,Model f does not connect to PC!,The model they are currently selling does not connect to the PC...in their website the software only go to model e...why do they sell model f when there is no working software? BAD BUSINESS!I am sending mine back.
2,Not for Subaru,"INNOVA 3030 Diagnostic Code Reader for OBDII VehiclesNot for Subaru. In spite of stating that all OBD-II DTC scan codes can be cleared on all vehicles, it doesn't work with a Subaru. I bought the Innova 3030 to diagnose why the Check Engine Light (CEL) appeared on my 2003 Impreza TS. The Subaru dealer wants $ to do this so I decided to buy an OBD-II scanner to get the DTC code and whatever other information I could with it. The DTC code appeared, P0032, which was useful but, when I tried to clear the code, it wouldn't. I phoned Innova about that and was told to try to clear it with an alternative method, plug in the scanner, run the engine, turn the key back to ""ON"", press the red button twice to clear the code. That didn't work and variations of it and the normal method didn't work. Innova knows about this problem but hasn't figured out how to fix it."
3,A must! but C'mon,"This tech is a 5star must! Get some comfort from knowing whats going on with those mysterious lights. However a 1star BUT, the main problem is the software has to be loaded on your computer for an online diagnose AND then it will launch every time you turn on the computer! C'MON you'll only need it now and then! So you have to install and remove it after each use."
2,"Well, it almost works!",The unit does a fine job reading the codes and that's it! Ran the installation CD on 2 different PC's and a laptop and couldn't get the computer to recognize that the tool was hooked up allowing the start menu to pop-up. When I manually made the menu appear it displayed that the tool was disconnected when in fact it was connected. When I tried to return it to Amazon they want me to pay for shipping....WTF? I paid for a FULLY-operational tool why do I have to pay when the product doesn't do what it's supposed to do? Another reason to buy from the manufacturer...and there are no guarantees there either.
4,Another good Artificial Intelligence compilation,"Not as awe-inspiring as Volume 1, this is nonetheless another great compilation in the Artificial Intelligence series.It starts off a little inconsistently, Mark Franklin's track is somewhat techno by numbers, but as the compilation goes on, the quality improves. It's usually the other way around!"
4,Mind Journey,Artificial Intelligence II is a CD of worth. It allows the listener to experience whatever they need to without distraction. It opens your mind and takes you on an amazing journey.
4,Artificial Intelligence 2: music for open minds,"I originally bought Artificial Intelligence 2 (AI2), on two principles: the WaxTrax reputation and the swank album cover. What i ended up with has become one of those albums that is the benchmark for what i have come to expect from the music i buy.AI2 cannot be categorized into slots such as ambient or trance, though it excells in both. Whether it was intentional from the outset or not, AI2 is a journey through the mindsphere complete with peaks of driving rythms, which is very obvious from the first note, to the valleys of calm inbetween. AI2 is original from beginning to end. It has, no sound loops and no sampling from the works of other people. It is a cohesive collection that has the potential to create a world within the listener, if they open their mind for a while."
2,You get what you pay for,The sweatshirt is nice & thick but it has a very small opening for the head so it ends up feeling very tight around the neck. The t-shirt is very thin and has an uncomfortable seam on the right side.
1,Save your money,"I can't remember how much I paid for this but whatever it was it was TOO much. The ramp part was like a flimsy platic piece of paper pratically and the fly wheels and rip cord don't do anything like they show them on tv. My boy wanted this for his birthday because he saw a comercial on tv but it's not anything like the ad. Save your money, fly wheels are a complete let down and a waste of your money."
5,the mongoose with a looooong tail!,this is not your typical mongoose! It appears to be a ring-tailed mongoose. The plush is very well made and highly collectible. Hansa has the best line of stuffed animals. I love that it is unique. great for teaching children about animals outside of the barnyard.
1,Horrible,Absolutely horrible. There is no sample music and we have no idea who the original artists are. Don't you hate when the radio doesn't tell you who sang that song that just played. Good job!!!
3,Hurts my ear,"This phone has great range and clarity. It's also very small and light, making it quite portable. However, it doesn't have many features, the volume is low and not adjustable, and the dang thing is so small that someone with stubby fingers would have trouble dialing. Also, it's uncomfortable to use. The phone wasn't right for me and I returned it for the ATT 9400. But it's good at what it's designed for."
3,NOT really headset compatible,"I specifically purchased the AT&T 9520 to use with a headset. I even bought the ""recommended"" (by Amazon.com) AT&T headset. When I received the phone, I discovered that there was inadequate headset microphone amplification resulting in callers not being able to hear me speaking. And this is NOT a headset problem. I tried several different headsets (Jabra, Plantronics, Radio Shack) and they all had the same problem. All of these headsets worked fine with a Northwestern Bell 39512 2-line 900MHz phone that I bought AFTER I gave up on the AT&T 9520. The only good point to this phone is the phenomenal range, but this is typical of 900MHz DSS phones. Bottom line - good phone for the money if you're not going to use a headset."
2,Terrible Tin Sound,A tin sounding feedback of my own voice. Unit is too small to hold comfortably for any length of time. Key pad too small to use consistently without error. For $100 seems like a toy rather than a durable electronic device. I returned the phone and am researching for replacement.
1,If not for the battery...,"Theoretically, this is a great phone. It looks nice, feels good (solid and not too bulky), has reasonable sound quality and range, and a headset jack. As a bonus, it has a compartment with an extra battery in the back of the base, for those long conference calls. Perfect.Unfortunately, it suffers from one fatal flaw - the battery. When we bought the phone, we immediately noticed that the battery life wasn't exactly long; if we didn't always return the handset to the base, it would run out.Now, less than a year later, both batteries die suddenly a few minutes into the first call, no matter how long we leave it on the charger. To make matters worse, the replacement battery doesn't appear to be one of the standard ones available at local stores (which have a wide selection), so we can't replace the batteries; we're forced to buy a new phone.Don't buy this phone; it's unusable. A pity, because in every other respect this is a great product."
1,AT&T 9520,"I bought this phone for its sleek design and affordable price. The first problem I encountered, after the warranty had expired, is the famous battery problem these phones face. No amount of charging or battery swapping could remedy the poor performance of the phone. I would be cut off 15 minutes into the conversation. The second problem I recently faced was the degradation of the sound quality down to unintelligible sounds. Finaly the phone started muting my conversation at random intervals. Very poor performance for a phone."
1,"Great idea, horrible phone.","Both batteries died within a year of minimal use. Backup battery seemed like a good idea, but what good is 2 dead batteries??"
1,Not a good buy,"The quality of sound is terrible. When I plugged in the headset, it didn't get any better - especially for the other party. There's some kind of an echo. I also bought AT&T H8500 which is almost exactly the same phone and it has the same problems.I like the size. I also like the fact that it charges a spare battery. When power goes out, the spare battery temporarily powers the base so that you don't lose the use of your phone."
3,How to waste $100.00,I purchased the phone in the hope I had found a wonderful product w/some of the features I had wanted. It's just not it and am contemplating returning it...but I am not sure for what. I loved the size and weight of it BUT that's it! A lot of money for very little.
5,totally awesome,I think this album is definitly in my top ten. Right next to Social Distortion Live and Welt's Broke Down.
1,These guys are infringing on our trademark,"As mentioned above, Second Chance is a registered trademark and has been for 4 years. This band has been notified in writing that they are infringing and need to stop using the name. Apparently they belive they can ignore the law. They have been given five months to comply. If they do not discontinue using the name , they will be shut down by legal action."
5,An experimental masterpiece...,"I've met with Autechre when I've heard ""Teartear"" for the first time. The deepness of the sound touches to the soul...The whole album is highly recommended, takes us to a different place..."
4,Flows of the future,"Only two discs into what was already becoming a trailblazing electronic career, and Autechre had begun a mastery into what would be known as their early minimalistic career of soothing industrial-ambient keyboard-drenched patterns. Not ever track floats as Amber's most keenly assembled and emotionally engaging, but the entire package still stands as a behemoth of old school progressive trance."
5,A Timeless Classic...,"I am a huge fan of Autechre,and I really like the direction they are moving in now,but I still feel that this album is their most moving and emotionally powerful work to date.Every piece on this album upon meticulous listening,stirs different emotions and feelings,creates wonderful atmospheres in its surroundings,and proves to be highly thought provoking.This album just has so much depth,it amazes me everytime I listen to it.Truly,a timeless classic."
4,"Nice, very nice",I herd this album though a friend. He bought this the same day I got 'Incunabula'. It's a great album that has been striped down from the completexity of Incunabula'. It is darker and more mellow. It is not as ambient either. It is one fantsic disc but I like the others by autechre more. Enjoy.
2,boring,I bought this CD and I was not satisfied what so ever. I would not play this CD around anyone. I think Autechre needs to work on their skills. Viedo games have better music than this.
4,Dark but mellow,"""Amber"" is either dark or introspective depending how you view it, but it's consistently listenable, which begs the question why the band have gone from being at the forefront of ambient dance to the poor end of industrial noise they seem to now be interested in. From what I've heard this is the most worthy Autechre release."
5,"Deeply troubling, necessary read","Ms. Shkilnyk has done the world a great service by producing this profoundly disturbing yet desperately necessary book. It deserves to be read by everyone brave enough to confront the complex and difficult realities of industrial democracy. There are no 'good guys' in real life, especially when circumstances like those described here persist in so many parts of the world. But maybe if more people read this book, some might get better than they currently are."
2,region 4 dvd poor,"While I love this film, the region 4 pal dvd is poor. It's video quality, and it's NOT in letterbox, as the specs online state."
2,I wish,"This product is fine if it fits your SINK. I wish there would have been a more thorough description of this item. The stem which screws into the sink itself was too wide. I don't recall there being any mention of the diameter of that piece. When I contacted the seller to return the item, I was told of a $5.00 restocking fee. That fee would have been waived had I ordered a replacement, but there was not a proper replacement offered. I kept the strainers. It would have cost more to send it back than what I had originally paid. And I hate forfeiting money on something I can't use."
4,Horse Stories Bio,"Horse Stories is led by the Austrailian singer-songwriter Toby Burke who's spent time in the States and a drummer from Texas who has spent time in London. Although it's been a while since I've seen them play last I believe the line-up may have changed a bit.This is a CD you can put in and drive up the coast of California and leave everything behind. This roots rock trio will deliver a moody, yet tranquil foundation for your departure. Definitely worth checking out!"
5,Good Stuff,"Very informative, It was certainly money well spent. If you are on the fence about this purchase, just get it."
5,Title Abstracting,Step by step video instructions of an actual title abstract. Excellent for investors or anyone who wants to research real estate. Good value and quick shipment.
5,Milton is King!,"Milton Nascimento is one of the 3 best Brazilians singers of all times. But this is not all about this fantastic artist. He's a great composer and a spectacular humanist too. If one wants to know Brazilian Art outside of the prejudicial cliche( samba, soccer, mulatas), he ought to listen/watch and see Milton!"
4,exciting throughout the whole book,"This book was very exciting and interseting to me. this book is a bout a boy named Rob, and he lives with his mother. In school he is assigned to write a autobiography about his life so far. He starts reflescting back to he early life and he remembers his mother watching spanish soap operas and always telling him what was happening. Also he remembers about how his grandfather use to always teach him about history, and his grandmother always telling him stories. He remebers him and his friends always listening to radios and watching channels to see if they could find his father or even listen to him. He wants to see his father so bad,even though he was the one who abandoned him and his mother before he was born because he didnt want a child.I thought this book was pretty good. I think that it was hard to follow the stories because there was more than one going a time. This book is a good book for anybody to read."
3,Seek By:Paul Fleischman,"This story was quite interesting to me, but from what I understood of it, I'll explain to you. There is a boy named Rob, and he lives with his mother, but leaves her to go search for his father. Rob tries to discover his father through their mutual love, music, and the radio. The story is full of true love that Rob has for his his family. The book basically goes through a young boys mind, living with one parent and making peace with it.My opinion of this book is that it was pretty good, out of the stars i would rate this book a three out of five. This is because the book was hard to understand. I would recommend this book to everyone who loves journeys, because this book is such a journey and it's kind of hard to put the book down."
2,Oversimplified and many of the points are obvious for someone in the business world,"I was not impressed by this book. I have come to expect from Nolo legal advice, and in this book I was expecting advice on navigating the intricacies of the tax status of non-profits. This book does not tell you how to file for 501(c)(3) status, for example. It does not tell you how to draft articles of incorporation or bylaws.This book is more aspirational, geared towards someone with minimal business experience who wants to start a non-profit, and who will have to use the services of lawyers and accountants for the nitty gritty details. The discussion on marketing, budgeting, etc is relatively obvious and trivial from the point of view of someone who has already worked in the ""for profit"" world for a while.Not recommended."
4,"Very GOOD, BUT","This is a very good book, lots of charts and check lists and a CD, but it wasn't written by an attorney so even though it as written by a person with a degree in law, there is no practical layering experience behind it, so this is why I give this one 4 stars and not 5."
2,Buy the book this one is advertising,Several other reviewers have already posted the truth about this book. It is an advertisement for another book. There are at least six headlines talking about tax-exempt status and none of them tell you anything. I have given it two stars because it does have some limited use as a paperweight. Sorry Nolo this is not a good effort.
2,"get the Mancuso ""How To Form A Nonprofit Corporation"" instead","Very simple, and not very useful. I bought this first, thinking it was the cheaper Nolo Nonprofit book. In the first few chapters there are at least 6 or 7 little comments ""*NOTE: SEE MANCUSO* for more information"". So many notices that it reads like an ad for the Mancuso book. On that point, I agree, Mancuso is much more detailed and helpful.The 'forms' provided on the CD rom are only computer versions of the checklists that are printed at the end of each chapter. Total waste of plastic."
4,Good information,"If you work with non profit organizations, it's imperative that you have good information to ensure that everyone stays within the letter of the law. One of the most critical stages for the non profit is the start up stage. NOLO guides are well known, and while they may not be ""rocket science"", few non profits are interested in re-inventing the wheel OR in designing rockets. This is an excellent tool in the hands of the ""average joe"" working with a non profit in the start up stage.You won't regret adding it to your library."
5,Thorough guide for the startup non-profit.,"Found this manual and companion CD an excellent resource while I am in the process of converting a community organization into a non-profit. Aside from the practical advice of what you need to know, it also provides a warning for mistakes you must avoid.Thoughtful, concise and essential. Highly recommended."
5,"No, it really is that good....","I dont know if I have enough skill with words to convey how wonderful this EP is. I certainly don't have the wordmanship that Ian Baker (the singer / songwriter here) has, because the lyrics on these songs are marvellous. But then, that makes it sound like one of those singles with clever words and a lousy tune, and I wouldn't want to do that, because the melody will, I can promise you, haunt you forever.5 stars probably seems a bit over the top. But it really is that good. ""Be Prepared To Stop"" has reminded me just what I love in music, and how good it can be. The cd has taken up residence in the player at home, and the songs have taken up residence in my soul...Trust me. You need this EP."
3,good second single,"This is Sarah Connor's second single. Here she's still playing the sexy soulstress, while today she is going more diva-ways. Danceable and catchy"
3,"Summary of ""You for ever""","This book is a summary of ""you forever"" from Doctor Lobsang Rampa.If someone is interested to go in details about the technics mentioned in this book they should also read ""You Forever""."
3,Not what I was expecting,"At first the book was very intriguing, really opened my mind to a more conscious and positive attitude, but the author states so many powerful things that will absolutely work! I lost faith in her techniques after reading about her dangerous surgery (how did that come to be in the first place) and then of her daughter - left me confused.Have tried most of her techniques... To no avail!Was very happy with amazons speed of delivery, the book itself is a one time read that simply gets you thinking!"
4,Very easy to read,Is us an easy read. Ther is no extra fluff. So it is very easy to understand. I love it!
4,Jazz,"Jazz was the first transformer that I ever got and he fell to peices two days after I got him, so my parents him back a got me ratchet instead. With this model of Jazz his arm and hood kept falling of but was easy to snap together he took about half an hour to transform both ways and looks pretty nice. Just to bad they could not get the rights from porsche."
1,Unreliable and frustrating,"Like other reviewers, I have been unhappy with my At&T phone. I purchased my phone eight months ago and have had to replace the handset battery twice. Batteries in other cordless phones I've owned have lasted for years.The delay between pusing the answer button and being able to talk is also annoying.Like most electronic products today, there are too many features on the AT&T phone. The instructions are complex too.As some have commented, the hand set is too small and uncomfortable to use.I would not buy this product again and if the battery fails again in the next six months, I'll throw the whole unit in the trash."
2,"Great features, poor range and sound quality","The features are great, but the sound quality and range are poor. My old Phonemate sounds much better and has a longer range."
3,Nice features,"This phone is nice, you'll like all the features. But the headset is just too small, it doesn't feel comfortable in your hand. Other than that I'm happy with this phone"
2,"A Good phone ,if you like to buy junk","I previosly owned a 10 channel att cordless phone and upgraded to the Att that you are reading about. I was very dipleased, you can stand in the same room and still get a staicy connection i got better range with my old 10 Ch phone"
2,poor !,"I too am disappointed by the poor design features of this phone.1. The phone unit is too small and is not comfortable to hold or to have resting on your shoulder. If you have big ears and hands, this phone will be intolerable.2. On several occasions, I'd dial a number and as soon as the other party picks up my phone would shut off. I shouldn't be having these problems.3. I can't use the phone and answering machine at the same time. Sometimes when I get a message, I like to dial the number as it comes off the machine. At other times it's important for me to share messages with others. This phone does not allow for either use.4. One good feature is that even if your electricity goes out, your messages are saved and can be retrieved later on. During a power failure, however, this phone does not work.Unfortunately, I don't recommend the purchase of this phone.I hope Lucent Tech/ATT product designers read these reviews so that they could come up with better products."
3,A clock without a battery?,"The 9350 has a clock for time/date stamp of messages but all it takes is for your power to go out for a second and the time is lost. Digital devices from thirty years ago had that problem, but it shouldn't happen today."
2,Good answering machine but lousy phone,"It takes seconds for the phone to turn on, and you can't actually pick up from the base station, without the headset. We're returning the phone, because it's just too annoying."
2,Too small...beeps too loud,"I had a previous AT&T 900mhz phone, which was world's better....but this one is just too small. The speaker is too small, the unit is too small, and it is difficult to lean the phone against your shoulder while talking. The sound wasn't all that great either....AT&T overall is a good phone company, but this is better for kids."
2,Disappointing,"We have always purchased AT&T phones for their reliability but this phone has been disappointing.You can turn off all of the ringers on the phone, but when someone calls and leaves a message you still hear their voice as they speak to the answering machine. I like to have the phone off when my toddler is napping so it doesn't wake him, but this phone won't allow me to eliminate the sound of a caller's voice (unless I turn the answering machine completely off and don't record incoming calls).I've also found that the sound is very fuzzy with both the reception and answering machine."
1,Broken Handset Already,I have had the phone for about 2 months. Handset already broken. I wouldn't buy this phone.
5,5 Star Worthy,"Oh my God! I am a faithful Voyager fan and LUV Kathryn Janeway. There is just something about her character that intrigues me. My friend has this book (it's her only Voyager book) and she's been reading it since December. I also own this book, and I can find only one complaint. That Ms. Taylor didn't go into more detail about her life. Oh well. What she did go into was like peeking into a Christmas present before Christmas. You don't know what's in there but whatever it is is sure to be wonderful. This book shows the sides of Janeway that we've already seen in other characters. It shows her as a daughter, sister, lover, captain and student. I admit that I cry easily, so I was an emotional rollocoster with MOSAIC. * there are no Voyager fans where I live so if you're a fan and want someone to talk to please e-mail me!*"
3,A Woefully incomplete biograpy of Captain Kathryn Janeway,"There were too many gaps in MOSAIC. It leapt and skimmed through her career when it should have cavorted and revelled in it. Kathryn Janeway's intensity, determination and leadership qualities rival that of Captain James T Kirk. But I would have liked to have known more about her career in starfleet, the star-ships she served on, her various ranks. Captain Jean Luc Picard was promoted from a lieutenant to a captain after saving the USS Stargazer and her crew, becoming it's new commander after the untimely death of the captain.Did Janeway leapfrog any ranks, was she ever a first officer etc?No I'm afraid I was a little disppointed but it was an adequate novel and insight into Janeway's character."
4,Very good! A Janeway fan's must read.,"This book was very good. Janeway sure had a hard time growing up. The story is so good I couldn't put it down. Although there is one thing that I think is overused in ALL Star Trek stories. That is crashing. They just crash too much, especially in suttles. I wish they could think of more things, but crashes add suspense....Anyway, it was a very good book my 3rd fav, TNG Vendetta being 1st and TNG Q-Sqared 2nd.If you want to understand or learn more about Janeway or if your a fan of her, you MUST read this book."
5,I loved this book!!,"I'm a Janeway fan so when I read some reviews about this book I just had to get it. I'm glad I did. It filled me in on Janeway's life and why she is the way she is. To her introduction to Data, to her blind date with William Riker, to how she knew Tom paris's father, Her first meeting with Tuvok(she didn't like him much at first), to her relationship with Mark,to her greatest tragedy. This book was a page turner and I didn't want to put it down until I had read it all. Sometimes when I read a book about a series sometimes the characters don't sound like themselves. I have read some Star Wars books like this. In this book though the characters sound just like they are in the series. I wished this could have been a episode. It would have fit right in! I have more appreciation for this character now. Captain Janeway is one strong woman! If you are a Captain Janeway fan there is no doubt about it you will love this book. I don't see how they could have made this book any better!!!"
2,Hardly Worth My Time,"Sophomoric at most, this story gives background on Captain Janeway, the captain on the series Voyager. The writing was dull, and it often felt as if I were reading a high-school student's writing as I perused the pages of this novel, foregoing time that could have been spent reading more heady stuff. Surprisingly, this banal writing came from one of the co-creators of the series.Though the writing was as sharp as a proverbial drawer full of beach balls (can I accentuate the dullness further?), one might find it enjoyable if one enjoys Star Trek: Voyager, and all the merry things that come along with said series. Personally, I would rather be reading the non-serials, and classics."
5,Excellent book,Captain Janeway is one of my favorite characters on Voyager I read this book and couldnt put it down. I also got the audio cassete the book is much better. If you like Captain Janeway you will love this book.
5,Excellent overview of networking theory,"Tannenbaum does a terrific job of explaining a difficult subject in easy terms. His style is very entertaining and accessible. He also gives a level view of everything, showing the flaws as well as the benefits of different models. I'd recommend this book to anyone who wants to get a thorough overview of networking theory."
5,Sublime- Provides a solid conceptual heuristic framework!!,Check out Professor Tanenbaum's web site as listed in this book. See also page 663 where he describe why he has his own web site.Client Server magazine on-line did a survey of CIO's and their top books of all time list....This book was on that list so I ordered it from amazon.com
3,abundant but diorderly,"It is difficult to explain the main ideas of computer networks to anyone,including college students majoring in computer science. Background information in many aspects are required. Since details in the 7 layers are mixed and crossed, the author should write a better introduction, or the readers will be confused with the technical parts followed. But Tanenbaum just scatter all materials through the chapters, and constantly remind the readers of the facts like ""it's the same idea as in ? layer"". Too many history, too few concepts. If you ocassionally need to know what the words like ""CSMA/CD"", ""GSM"", ""ATM"" mean, this book is a good choice. But I don't think it's a good textbook for college studies."
3,"Lots of good material, but poorly organized","While it's much better than some of the other networking books out there, this book is poorly organized. If you want organization and something that it easy to read and understand, go with Data Communications by William Stallings. But if you want a book that contains information on just about everything you want to know about computer networks (including theoretical aspects -- where Data Communications is weak), Tanenbaum's classic is the way to go."
2,Only a reference book,"I think it's not a good choice for beginners. Too much theory and not well-organized. However, I'd like it to put in my library as a good refernce book. If you know what you're looking for in the book, Comp. Networks is helpful..."
2,Tenenbaum has disappointed,"I am a great fan of Tenenbaum. Before this book, I studied three of his other books. The best being ""Modern Operating Systems"". But here Tenenbaum has produced a pathetic book. The chapters are not well organized at all. Too much information bunched together. Networking is a lot of mathematical stuff; and this book is theory oriented. The book could be considered okay as a reference book. But to consider this the sole book for networking knowledge is a big mistake. Plus, the book is too expensive!"
2,bad print job: eyestrain headache,"The print quality is amazingly poor. Looking closely at the characters, there are small divots around the edges where they weren't fully inked. The overall impression is of ragged, weak, and somehow slightly disorienting text. It is an annoying chore to read. (I've seen many copies in many bookstores: they are all the same gray-on-off-white mess.)The content is excellent. It's surprisingly up-to-date for a book published in 1996. The occasional use of calculus is illuminating, though the occasonal code dump is not."
4,"A fairly good book, albeit a little detailed","As an undergraduate student, I'm quite enthusiastic about all the topics Tanenbaum has covered in his book. However, to read it cover to cover is a lot of work; it's better to use it as a reference book."
5,A must-read,"This is probably the most complete and in depth theoretical approach to Computer Networks book you can buy.The structure of this book is based mainly on the OSI Reference Model which is divided in 7 different layers. Each chapter in the book is dedicated to a layer, in this way, one can get an insight of a broad variety of subjects such as IEEE standards (Ethernet, Token Ring, etc,), Congestion control and routing Algorithms, network and transport layer protocols (IP, TCP and UDP) and many more topics.As a complement you should read Richard Stevens TCP/IP Illustrated, volume 1 for a more practical approach to TCP, UDP and IP.The best book for beginner, intermediate and advanced users."
3,Re: A solid book reference but not pedagogical...,I used this book for a networking course. This is a good reference but not a good book to learn networking from. Some concepts are not really clear. I always believe that few basics well is more important than absorbing lots of facts that you don't understand or half-understood.This book could have been split into 2 volumes.My advice for beginners is that don't use this book.
3,"Not easy to read, but a good reference.","I have a tough time reading it, it is not easy to digest the material. But overall, it serves as a good guide to networking technologies generally. It is not for beginners who want a simplified view of computer networking."
2,For BSEE grads who knows zero but needs to show off,"It's okay to be technical..but it has to be complete too! The book seems unclear on who should be reading it. It mention things like Fourier Series but does not explain it in detail. If you're a business person who deals with networks and just want detailed knowledge this is too much. If you are an advanced engineering student, you really don't need anyone to tell you how to compute the wavelength. If it's meant to be technical...it's not technical enough. But if it's meant to be easy reading...it's too technical."
5,Simply the best,"There is no doubt that this is the best book describing computer networks and data communications. It covers the subject in a layered approach, and describes each one in detail. It also discusses newer topics such as ISDN, ATM etc. in great detail.Keeping up with the modern Internet world, it discusses the TCP/IP philosophy wonderfully. I would strongly recommend this book, along with Prof Douglas Comer's ""Computer Networks and Internets"", Prof Behrouz Forouzan's ""Introduction to Data Communications"", and William Stallings's ""Compuetr and data Communications""; so that you understand networks and data communications completely."
2,Maybe for fast reading,"This book seems to be fine if you only want to read it as an introduction, and never use the small details there.It has many mistakes in it, and the application layer chapter is outdated and wrong.Try to read any of the chapters anywhere else (like the Kurose & Ross book), and you'll see what I mean."
2,GREAT SCENICS - POOR VIDEO,"The scenes of the Grand Canyon are spectacular and very moving. The music is nice too, if you like that kind of ethereal, av-ant guard type music.The video quality is very poor. Maybe because we're all used to DVD quality now, and this is a VHS and an old one to boot.It is most definitely worth a see IF you can buy it at a reasonably low price, or rent it."
3,honey dipper - fair design,"Everything about this honey is good except the decorative disc (with bee cut-out) on the end. It is so big that it makes it hard to twirl the dipper. We are getting used to it, but it would be better without it. We're keeping it but are still looking for something better."
5,Worth the extra bucks,"This is a durable honey dipper that can be washed by hand of by machine. I needed a dipper that was not wood, and this one is exactly what I was looking for. Better quality than expected."
2,"Brutal Portrayal, Gratuitous Writing","Having read the reviews prior to buying this book, I was quite interested in reading this book. Previously, I had read the Left Behind series, and was looking for something with a little more realistic portrayal of what is to come.While I think that this novel accurately portrayed the horrors that are to come, the language and depictions of violence were completely gratuitous. And the book was horribly edited, as there were numerous grammatical errors throughout.I would also recommend Joel C. Rosenberg's novels (The Last Jihad, The Last Days, and The Ezekial Option) if you are looking for something action-packed, with writing somewhere between Left Behind and Tom Clancy."
5,Real short,"Buy it. Read it. It's disturbing and extruciatingly memorable. It's not a ""pleasant"" read as many of the reviewers state; but, it's a necessary read. It pulls you in and grinds you up and, if you don't come out changed, then you're beyond hope. Every person who thinks the ""Left Behind"" series is great should be forced to read this book. Challenge your self, you'll never be the same again."
1,NOT FOR CHRISTIAN READERS,"IN NO WAY SHOULD THIS BOOK BE SOLD ALONG WITH THE CHRIST CLONE TRILOGY!!!!! WE ALL FALL DOWN IS FULL OF PROFANITY THAT OFFENDS FROM THE FIRST TO THE LAST PARAGRAPH. ALONG WITH AN ""R"" RATING PEOPLE SHOULD BE CONCERNED FOR MR. CALDWELL AND HIS CLAIM OF CHRISTIANITY, NO CHRISTIAN MAN WOULD ALLOW HIMSELF TO WRITE WORDS THAT WOULD TURN EVEN SATANS HEAD."
2,"Troubling, disturbing... really, REALLY not worth your time","There are better attempts out there at portraying the Biblical notion of Armageddon. The writing is flawed, the lurid and wanton sexuality (and really, what we're talking about here is the very disturbing scenes of rape, bestiality, more rape, and still more rape) are highly unnecessary, and the graphic nature of the novel will leave most disturbed.I gave it two stars because there's a wonderfully described scene in which the main character gets the mark of the beast - but the book is not worth it. If you get off on rape, bestiality, and torture, then you'll love this book."
2,More profanity than I've seen anywhere,"This is not that bad as books go. The editing is rank amatuer and the author needs to use a spell checker, but the story holds up and will cause you to think. That is, of course, if you can stomach the extreme profanity. I don't wince easily and I think characters should be realistic in their dialogue, but the author has gone WAY overboard."
4,"A disturbing, but worthwhile read.","This book is a callous, in-your-face portrayal of a person who has hardened his heart against God, to the point of no return. It shows the harsh reality of what happens when people deny God and instead rely on the human ego to get them through life. Jimmy Lordan is a depiction of all the confused, hateful, self-absorbed non-Christians who think they are in control of their lives and can find no reason to surrender their souls to Christ. As a Christian, I was saddened by this book because I know there are so many people in this world who will meet the same destiny as Jimmy. I definitely would not want to miss the Rapture and be left on an earth where the majority of people will be like the main character of this book"
5,A perfect alternative to Left Behind,"I'm a Christian and I just didn't like left Behind. It seemed to be aimed more towards young teenagers than intellegent adults. We all Fall Down is certainly more intellegent and much more intersting. The characters talked and acted like real people. I know that some people have a problem with the language, but it strikes me that the author is simply reflecting the reality of the way people actually speak. I hear much worse every day as I walk to work. I suppose if you live your life with your head in the sand, some of it might come as a shock, but for the rest of us, it's not. Great book if you're tired of settling for poorly written fiction."
5,"Finally, a novel about Christianity that doesn't insult us","Why do they always have to make it seem simple? Why are the chareacters always so boring? Why do they always make it seem like morality suddenly becomes black and white? Why do they always seem like they are written for fifth graders? Why areChristian novels so BAD? If y6ou've asked yourself these questions, buy We All Fall Down. Smart, funny, and totally engrossing, this is the best novel about Christianity that I've ever read."
5,Brilliant,"I think, perhaps, the people who have given this book a bad review just can't imagine someone having the struggles that Jimmy had, or they just can't imagine themselves having to do the suffering.If the apocalypse is anything near as bad as we are led to belive, Jimmy's experiences will be closer than those of, say, the Trib Force. Yes, Jimmy does get 2 years in the clear, but he suffered as much as anyone. And to be perfectly honest, he made a reasonable choice. He did not go to hell because he followed the antichrist. He went to hell because he couldn't come to worship the diety that allowed all of the suffering to happen. I don't know that I wouldn't make the same decision (although I don't think the apocalypse is going to happen).The book is brilliant. It will make you think. Perhaps it will move you to try to stop what so many seem to take as inevitable. That's the highest praise a work of literature could aspire to. Read it!"
3,great boots as long as there is no rain or snow,"i bought thest boots less than a month ago, as i wanted something for working outside. every night when i get home, i polish them and shine them. well the first snow i took these things through, the back stiching came out on both boots. this is not something i would expect from a boot that is american made. also the microbial lining, is not effective. but other than that they are comfortable."
5,Experimental Industrial at it's best!,"In his second album, Chris Randall (frontman for Sister Machine Gun), shows us what he can do with his many electronic toys. In The Torture Technique he explores new sounds to add to the jazzed up industrial sound he created with the first album, Sins of the Flesh. And despite the other-worldness of the layers of feedback and distortion, Mr. Randall manages to weave them together with grinding guitars, angry vocals and powerful beats to make an uncommon thing: a catchy experimental album. Songs like Wired, Crackhead, Salvation and Sacrafice, which explore the subjects of deprevity, drug addiction and desperation, will be running through your head for weeks. This album is among my all time favorites and I definately recommend it to anyone who has a taste for the industrial side of music."
4,UFB+,"Power punk emo in all its middle American glory. Sounds, at times, like an emo Elvis Costello (especially on ""Of Course We Will""), but with much less wimp nerd whining. Impressive power chords shift effortlessly into melody. There's a wide variety of song types. Even has a romantic ballad (""A Million Hearts""). I usually skip over the slower ballads, but this one held me due to the heartfelt delivery. The title track is an acoustic quickie that seemed out of place until I got the joke. The rest of the songs all rip, with sharp time jumps, clear guitar chords, and emotional singing. Great party, pogo style music with more inventiveness and experimentation than most."
3,He's not Elvis!,"I want to like this album, but I can't get past the waaay-too-obvious aping of Elvis Costello's vocal delivery and pronunciation (not to mention the Elvis-inspired album title). The title track particularly makes me gag and scream 'YOU'RE NOT ELVIS!!!' It's a shame, because these kids have talent and this CD is really good on many other fronts. (hence the 3 stars I give it regardless.) Apparently I'm not the only one who feels this way, as a quick listen of UFB's latest album proves that Bill's singing has fortunately lost that Elvis quality - a definite improvement, being yourself instead of inexplicably mimicking a singer who was in vogue nearly 20 years ago. Of course, if you're not old enough to remember Declan McManus, then feel free to enjoy these tunes in blissful ignorance!"
2,"good, if you like radio alt. rock like weezer and greenday","but just not that interesting, theres just nothing new here. They pretty much sound like a generic weezer, I really think thats the only way to describe them. But hey if you cant get enough of weezer and you need something to fill the gaps between album releases, then by all means pick up this generic masterpiece."
5,"6 stars? no, wait... 7 stars...","If UFB gets any better, they will totally blow my mind. I've had this CD for almost a year, and I still listen to it constantly. The razor-edged guitars (reminiscent of weezer) make for awesome listening in ""Soaked in Cinnamon"", while McShane's voice floats on ""Real Drums"". Some standouts include She Don't Even Know My Name, Little Apple Girl, Soaked in Cinnamon, Far, Far Away, and Glitter and Glue, though most of the album rocks. There are maybe two songs that are obvious filler, but even those aren't too bad. Punk, pop, emo, rock, call it whatever the hell you want, but this is damn good music and UFB is here to stay."
1,if I could give them zero stars I would,"I saw these guys in concert with the Impossibles and I hated it. I'm not saying that they can't play their instruments, I'm just saying the music they played was terrible and uninspired. Boo these men."
5,hot property,this a very good cd i would highly recommended to anyone who had half a brain when it came to judging music
1,Don't Bother,Length:: 0:44 MinsYou really get what you pay for with this. It would cost me more to get a box to return it.
1,"Great Idea, Poor Practicality","This was just was I was looking for: small and easily detachable. Of course, a metal to metal connection must be sturdy, right? The release mechanism broke and the tiny ball bearings fell out in five minutes. I fixed it, only to watch five minutes later as the weight of my three keys and one plastic fob break the mechanism. Great idea, if it was reliable. Maybe I bought a defective one, but be careful with the keys you place on these rings because half of them may not be there when you go looking for them."
5,Works great,"I purchased this to use with pepper spray. The pull apart key ring is a safety feature I won't do without. I can easily put it off my key ring if I need to, or to use the pepper spray quickly and noiselessly (without keys jangling). Also, if your keys are demanded of you, it disengages quickly for you to keep!"
5,It does its job!,"There's not too much to say about a key holder, except whether or not it does its job! This one does! It has very high quality construction and promises to last for many years. It is exactly what I wanted, and could not be better for my purpose."
1,DO NOT BUY - BROKE WITHIN 2 WEEKS,"Yes, just like some of the other reviewers, this item broke within two weeks of ordering it. The ball came out that holds the two pieces together, so now it could pull apart easily. I was lucky I didn't lose my car key."
1,It broke within a week,"I used it under ""normal"" conditions, and yet within a week, it was broken. Can't be fixed, because of the little bearing fell out and went missing."
1,Broke 1 hour after first use,"I wanted this to take my key off easily when going to the gym/mechanic etc. I went to the gym tonight and took it off with no problems, but when I tried putting it on (an hour later) it was broken already. One of the pins must have fallen out. This product is poorly made and I am not even going to bother returning it, as gas will cost just as much to drive to the nearest UPS store. I wouldn't recommend this product."
5,Really good key ring at the right price,"The dealership where we usually buy our cars gives the keys to a new car on one of these rings. I've liked them for years because of the speed and ease with which you can separate your house key from your car key when turning your car over to someone you don't know. I've never had one break or fail to function in any way.My husband totalled his car (not his fault, but I complained anyway; I know my duty), and when he gave the key to the insurance company representative he took off his house key and left the car key on that half of the ring, so I had to buy another one (I'm not terrible; I virtuously told him it could happen to anybody). This one was the exact match for the half he had kept, and it appears identical to the ones that have served us so well and have been so convenient to use, so I don't hesitate to recommend it.It's very inexpensive, but it's been one of those small things that make life a bit easier."
1,Would not pull apart!,"Ordered this one and another similar model due to so-so reviews for these type of products. At ~$3 each, cheap enough to order two and hedge one's bets. The other one arrived faster and worked as expected. This one, unfortunately, did not.Try as I might, I could not get the two pieces to pull-apart. Eventually, the pulling caused the rings to bend, rendering the product useless. Even using tools, I never did successfully pull them apart.Not even worth sending it back. I had much better success with the Lucky Line 71501."
2,Bulky; broke after about 6 months,This keychain was larger than I had anticipated when I ordered it. It worked great until one day I found half of my keys on the ground outside my truck. The keychain had broken and I didn't have a clue until I got back to my car.
1,Never Showed Up,"The product was never delivered. We received confirmation, however, over a month later and no product."
1,very cheap,We bought this awhile back and I didnt have time to create a review this product broke after a very short time.
2,Broke after 6 months,The title says it all. Worked great until then. Used it for my mailbox key so I could leave my vehicle running.
1,Disappointed,I owned one of these years ago and it must have been another company because it was much more heavy duty. I loved that one and finally got around to getting this one. Straight out of the box one of the lock balls fell out rendering it useless. The price is so low it's not worth returning and I have since glued it together for use but thats not the point of this product.
1,DEFECTIVE CONSTRUCTION,3 SECTION MESH HOSIERY / PANTYHOSE WASH PROTECTORTHE PLASTIC TUBING HAS COME OUT OFF ITS CASING. IT HAS POINTED ENDS THAT CATCH ON THE ITEMS THAT IT IS SUPPOSED TO PROTECT. GOOD IDEA BUT NEEDS BETTER CONSTRUCTION AND QUALITY CONTROL.
5,Love my bottle!,I will never use another bottle. Water tastes so much better than in plastic and stays cooler longer.
3,Not the top,"The bottle is superb -- the top not so, The push-down-to-drink action produces a puny flow that, to me, is inadequate. This is surprisingly frustrating in an otherwise superior design."
4,Great replacement for plastic bottles,"I used to be a major culprit of buying cases of bottled water. We do recycle but with the amount of energy it takes to make all those bottles and the reported health risks with reusing them it was time to find an alternate solution. As a family, we drink a lot of water and between hiking, biking and my 5 hour-a-day commute we need water to mobile. The Sigg bottles are extremely light-weight and easy to clean (I bought the brush too). You can find a variety of different styles to suit everyone in the family and the Classic top has a loop so you can clip it to your backpack or bike. One note: be careful if you have a dark color bottle and you leave it in the car in the sun, it will heat up fast."
3,Don't like sport cap,"The bottle is nice, but the sport cap doesn't work too well. You can't squeeze the bottle, so you can't control the amount of water you get (unless you want to suck on the cap). I'd recommend the bottle, but would go for a regular loop cap instead."
3,Don't like the sports top,"These are a nice alternative to buying bottled water. But I don't like the sports top because it is hard to drink from. The aluminum finish streaked in the dishwasher. Don't know why that color and not the others (red, black) was affected. And they all dent easily. Even so, I'm glad I purchased them and plan on getting different bottle tops."
2,get the loop top instead,"I cannot recommend this item as the top is pretty much poorly designed fancy garbage. It is not at all suitable for this type of bottle, but would work fine on a squeezable bottle. It takes a significant amount of pressure to hold the dispenser in the open position. Once in the open position, the water trickles out at VERY slow rate. To get the water faster you would need to suck on the bottle which looks quite foolish, but is also ineffiecient as there's no vent to release the vacuum you create. I just remove the entire top to drink. No issues with the bottle itself but I should have gotten the loop top."
4,Hard to get the last bit of water out of the container and into your mouth,"It's a solid design and nice color, but mine has a dent on the bottom of the bottle. Also, it's hard to get the last bit of water out of the container and into your mouth."
5,Sigg Water Bottle,"Just what I was looking for in a non-leaching bottle solution, great gift idea and a contribution to the ""green"" effort. Also, great designs!"
2,Not impressed,"I was very excited about my Sigg bottle. However, though it looks really good, I'm unhappy because one cannot fit in ice cubes, it has terrible insulation if they fit anyways, and the sports top that I purchased releases barely any water. I also have a Thermos brand stainless steel bottle which, though plain and not nearly as trendly as the Sigg, works much much better."
3,Sigg,Ordered two water bottles - were shipped individually with $6 added to each one for shipping - ridiculous amount - both could have shipped together for same amount. Will not order from them againSigg Lifestyle Loop Top Water Bottle (0.6-Liters)
1,Water Bottle NOT AVAILABLE,"My daughter had her heart set on this water bottle... we purchased it with a gift certificate, and were anticipating the order to arrive in the next few days. We just received an email stating that our order has been canceled for no given reason. this company ONLINE FITNESS should be banned from Amazon. They lie about the products they have. I would like to find out how I can put in a FORMAL COMPLAINT about this particular vendor... breaking their promise and breaking my daughter's heart. They should be ashamed of themselves."
3,Pretty resuable bottle,"This Sigg bottle is a cute way of saving the planet, keeping yourself healthy and always having enough water. I love Sigg bottles, but the sports drinking cap is funny to use- pressure must be applied to drink out of the bottle. If your hands are generally clean, this is an okay mechanism but... I would rather not be out and about with my fingers anywhere near my water bottle cap. It was troubling to find leakage the second time I used the bottle/cap together, but I assume it was just the way I screwed on the top, as it has not happened again. Sigg is great, but opt for a different bottle top unless you are running or cycling."
2,A Thinly-Veiled & Dull Bio of Brown's Life With Navratilova,"Even though this book was terrible, it starred lesbians, and that's got to count for something. Exactly 2 stars."
2,A Horrid Example,"This book is a ""horrid example"".The author and Martina Navratilova were, for a time, a very public couple. Then they broke up. And Brown made the fatal error of writing a roman-à-clef. This is always a mistake. Getting revenge on your ex is death on good writing. It's a shame, because Brown is ordinarily an excellent writer."
3,"Interesting, but Baring-Gould's Effort is Better","This was a good effort, but it mostly consists of extended plot synopses. The original - ""Nero Wolfe of West Thirty-Fifth Street"" by William S. Baring-Gould - still stands as the best offering for those who cannot learn enough about Archie and Nero.Besides, Baring-Gould had access to Rex Stout, who was alive when this definitive work was written.What's good about this? Well, the plot outlines do help make sort of thematic sense of the books, and helps a reader keep his characters straight.It just does not add much of anything new."
5,I only rated it 5 because there was nothing higher.,"The Far pavilions is my absolute faovrite book, and to those that have read it they'll probably agree. I was reading it during the school year, and when I got to Shushula's death, I couldn't put it down. I read that part in the halls and bumped into almost everyone. I didn't even look up from the book. My friend had to sout in my ear to tell the bell rung. Now, see how addictive it is? worse than nicotine."
3,Far Pavilions,"The bestseller about a Eurasian couple seeking for love and survival amidst the turmoil of 19th century India and Afghanistan.Astonishing in scope, but exhausting in length. Painfully expository, though the battle sequences near the end are worth reading. Largely a romance novel, and quite old-fashioned in its view of gender relations. Also old-fashioned in its portrayal of ethnicity, but quite sensitive for the time period (late 1970's). Rather interesting in the light of recent history -- Kabul as the city founded by Cain. One character slides annoyingly in and out of a particularly irritating stereotypical Irish brogue. On the other hand, some of the landscapes are lovely.I found my eyes glazing over, but I can't deny there were exciting bits. I remember Kaye's other work as being somewhat more original and less bloated."
4,The Far Pavilions,Love this book. It has been on my favorites list for years and finally here is a hard bound copy. Thanks!
4,"Great read, I highly recommend it","I found this book on a ""Epic"" forum. I wouldn't call it an epic, but it was a great read. I found the characters believeable and the history accurate."
5,This is a great book,"This book has a little bit of everything: history, a look at two cultures at war with one another, great characterization, and a scathing description of imperialism and why it rarely works. I have read countless books in my life from ""the classics"" to romance, science fiction and everything in between. Rarely have I been so deeply satsified by a book as I was with this one."
5,"Old Read, New Review","Whenever someone asks me what my favorite book is I ALWAYS say Far Pavilions. I read this book over 15 years ago and still remember the vivid scenes like I read it yesterday.So why write this now? Well, my favorite books are almost all referred by someone else and I don't mean Oprah. In turn I like to share special reads with others. Like some other reviewers, I have wanted to go to India ever since I read this. I can picture the mountains, I can smell the back streets, I can feel the tension and I can't even remember the entire plot.I'm a visual kind of guy. If the author describes it and I can see it I will remember forever. This happened over and over again in FP. The visual images are burned into my brain. I love them."
2,"The Pointers on ""Automatic""","The Pointer Sisters can smoke the stage. ""Live At the Opera House"" is a great live album (though it might not appeal to fans of ""Slowhand"" and ""Neutron Dance"" -- it's the Pointers BEFORE they went disco, when their act was about to be pinched by Bette Midler). This ""Live"" album is mainly the Pointers as funk divas, but its mouthwatering track listing is ruined by a pedestrian band, plus arrangements and vocals that are never better than functional, lacking all soul and inspiration."
1,BE CAREFUL,"I WANTED THIS CONCERT SO BAD AND WHEN I GOT IT, IT WOULD NOT PLAY IN ANY OF MY 3 DVD PLAYERS. I SENT IT BACK FOR ANOTHER ONE BUT THAT TOO WOULD NOT PLAY IN ANY OF THE MACHINES. I TOOK IT TO MY FRIENDS HOUSE AND HE PUT IT ON BOTH OF HIS AND IT WOULD NOT PLAY. IT WENT INTO DISC ERROR AND THEN ON ONE OF HIS DVD PLAYERS, A SIGN CAME UP AND SAID PAL. PAL FORMATS DO NOT PLAY ON MOST USA MACHINES. AMAZON SAID THEY WOULD REFUND MY MONEY UPON RETURN. THEY SAID THE DVD IS NOT LISTED AS A PAL AND I WOULD GET A REFUND. NOW THEY SAID THEY ARE NOT AND I AM VERY UPSET. I HAVE BROUGHT OVER A HUNDRED DVD'S FROM THEM AND I CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE MY MONEY. I AM GOING TO SEND A LETTER ABOUT THIS MATTER TO THE COMPANY. I WANT MY MONEY BACK OR CHOICE ANOTHER DVD FOR THAT ONE WHICH IS A PAL."
4,An overlooked Gem,This is one of my favorite albums. It mixes styles in an interesting an fresh way. It is an honest album through which you can feel the emotion of the songwriters and performers. Nothing short of inspired.
2,Ocular Anatomy and Physiology,This book is written by several different authors. The quality of writing varies greatly. This is a short book that seems to be written to impress the reader with how smart the authors are. The problem is that anybody who would understand this book as written wouldn't need a quick book on eye anatomy. The first chapter is especially confusing for the novice.
5,Couldn't Put It Down,"My mother-in-law recommends a lot of LDS fiction, and this is a favorite. Good mix of mystery and new love. I can't wait for the sequel!"
3,Almost good,"This is a book that could have been very good, but it stops just short. The characters frequently do and say things that just don't ring true. For instance, the characters often kiss the cheeks of people they just met; that might be okay if it were set in Europe, but these are small towns in California and Idaho. Also, the plot gets a little ridiculous (spoiler warning) unless you believe that twins can use mind control on each other. I really wanted to like it, but it kept irritating me. If you like this genre, try Betsy Brannon Green and Jeffrey S. Savage instead."
1,Missing important information!,Beautiful dress! Exactly what my daughter was looking for for her wedding. Unfortunately there is no sizing information so will need to go elsewhere.
4,Buffalo Wolf,"Powerful real life adventures of a biologist working one on one with bison and wolves in the north. If you're wondering what goes on behind the scenes of those nature documentaries this is the book. Not for the faint of heart though. Makes you feel like rooting for the beleagured bison to once, just once, get revenge on the wolf. In the end however, it turns out that humanity is more of a problem than the wolves. Big interests with agri-agendas want to destroy this particular bison herd. I liked the book's no nonsense approach to the ""people problems"" and behind the scenes politics."
4,A Sense of Place,"Lu Carbyn's book presents a totally new perspective on wolves, bison, and wildlife management and research. His recounting of his time in the field, his personal observations, the politics and the bureaucracy interwoven with the science he tries to hold to is honest and revealing. His love for the land he returns to time after time shines through most of all. If you are looking for a ""wolf book"" that is personal and thought-provoking, Mr. Carbyn's THE BUFFALO WOLF: PREDATORS, PREY, AND THE POLITICS OF NATURE is one you will want to read."
1,horrible!...,This is the worst book I have read on Princess Diana. The bookmade me cringe. It was so unbeleviably stupid that I could noteven bring myself to finish it. Don't waste your money on thispiece of [not good material]. The only reason I give it 1 star is because [website] does not allow for any thing less!
4,Impossible - NO,For those who loved Diana and for those who are into studying what life after death is about....you need to read this!
1,Skeptical,"After reading a number of such books, my question remains the same. How is it that a person who found so much to do in life has nothing better to do in the afterlife than to play meddlesome mom to those of us who are still here?!"
1,Full of humour and joy!,Right then -- I admit I read this book only for the unintentional humour and I wasn't disappointed! This is an exquisitely silly book that would never have found a publisher if poor old Diana hadn't been hauled in to give it a certain tarnished cachet.You know it was good to learn Diana is still hanging out with celebs in the afterlife.
1,Disappointing,"I have read many books about the afterlife and almost every book ever written about Princess Diana. Unfortunately, this author hasn't read any. Her ""glimpses"" of the afterlife don't ring true and her description of Princess Diana's personality is equally off base. I was disappointed because I thought this would be a book I'd love. Instead it just made me cringe. Read it if you like but please search Amazon for other books on the afterlife and other books on Princess Diana. Don't fall for this foolishness. You can do so much better."
3,Management in disguise of leadership,"This book tells the reader more about manangement than about leadership, based on the trivial recognition that no perosn cannot exert successful leadership without having sufficient expertise in management. Ten years ago, when management titles ""hyped"", this book's title might have been Flexible Management: Prerequisites for successful entrepreneurship.Benno D. Hoffmann"
5,"Better than China Trade, and C.T. was great!","This book has interesting characters and plot, and is extremely well-written. I read it first, then found China Trade, the first novel in the series, in the library. As a (real) man, I can say that Rozan's Bill Smith is realistic; I would not have guessed that the author was female if I hadn't already known it. Smith reminds me of J.P. Beaumont, Jance's Seattle detective, and I can't think of a better compliment. It was a pleasant surprise to find that China Trade was written from the viewpoint of Lydia Chin. I hope that the viewpoint continues to alternate between the main characters in the later novels. If the quality continues, Rozan will join J.A. Jance, Minette Walters, Dick Francis, Robert Crais, and Ed McBain on my A-list of mystery writers whose new books I will buy in hardcover. On to Mandarin Plaid!P.S. Jonathan Kellerman is borderline for my A-list. Sue Grafton, Robert Parker, and James Lee Burke are former A-listers."
4,A dramatic and well-written P.I. novel,"I thought this was a well plotted and hard hitting PI novel. It is a fast paced, well-written page-turner with a dramatic and satisfying conclusion. Smith and Chin are interesting and likeable characters, but possibly a bit underdeveloped. (But I'll attribute this minor complaint to the fact that I did not read the first Rozan book.) The Smith/Chin relationship seems a little familiar, and the relationship with the burned out detective also seems overdone, but overall, Rozan creates a believable and original story that blends big-city corruption and inner city violence.The minor complaints mentioned above notwithstanding, I give this a strong recommendation and I am looking forward to the next installment."
3,I was really looking forward to reading this book,"Rozan is a favorite of mine, but the other books I had read by her were focused on Lydia Chin. This book shifts the focus to Bill Smith (who sometimes partners with Lydia Chin). I missed Lydia and I found this book a little too ""Humphrey Bogart"" for my taste. I would not describe this book as a real page-turner, at least for me. Still, Rozan is a very skilled writer, particularly good at plotting and creating believable characters, people you care what happens to. This book would particularly appeal to people who like tough, gritty detective mysteries."
4,Well above average.,"A wonderfully written and richly textured novel. Very well plotted and it makes sense thru-out.Some passages were so well written I found myself reading them three or four times just to appreciate their beauty.It is at least semi-dark and not the fastest read, but well worth the time and effort. It needs to be savored.The protagonists are well drawn and this should be a strong series. The supporting cast is most intriguing."
5,"Don't start it, if you don't have time to finish it.","As an avid Tony Hillerman fan, I loved this book. It may even surpass many of his efforts. The story grabs you from the start and makes one want to read it through without stopping. Hopefully, we will now have a more steady flow of Navajo-Rez mysteries and lore with both Hillerman and the Thurlo's churning them out."
2,Was hoping things would get better but they didn't,"This is the 2nd book I have read in this series and it will be my last. I was hoping it would be better than ""Blackening Song"", but it wasn't. I hate it when I can figure out who the murderer is before the end of the book and that is exactly what happened here. Half way through I knew who done it. Very sad when the authors can't be more creative than that."
4,Very Good Book,"I am a new reader to this genre. I chose this book because I was looking for a ""thriller"" with a female heroine. While I did NOT find this book a ""thriller,"" in terms of not being able to put it down, the story did keep moving right along, and I did find it to be a very interesting mystery. While I would recommend this book to readers who are interested in Indian lore and the southwest, I would equally recommend it to readers who aren't particularly interested in this setting, as well. Overall, a very enjoyable book."
5,Let's be simple about this,"This album should be listened to by everyone. Not a day goes by that I don't put some part of it on. Borrow it from a friend, listen to the samples, and you'll want it. Something for everyone to enjoy. By the way, rewind to before the first song, there's a cover of ""Strange Days"" faaar better than any other...and there's a hidden track at the end, very romantic and good for endless encounters with your loved one. You just won't believe it."
3,Bourjois eyeshadow-rose,Item did appear new and is a pretty color. Can use wet or dry. Probably will not repurchase. Shipping did not take as long as expected from the UK.
4,Sennheiser GA2 review,"Good product. Holds receiver in rack properly, and its pretty sturdy. I suggest buying the antenna relocation kit (or making one) so your antennas are brought out front instead of in the back of your rack. There is only one minor problem that I've found with this mounting kit. The output jack is on the back of the receiver, so if the input is on the front of the next unit in your signal chain, you will either have to loop the cable below/over the receiver or drill a hole through the mounting plate between the antenna holes to get the cable where it needs to be."
4,A must have for any mother-daughter relationship,"A friend showed me this book that she had given to her mom for Mother's day this year. I needed a Thank You gift for my mom for all she has done for me and my family recently. This was perfect! I wish it wasn't out of print because I think this is a great gift! It was thought provoking in terms of memories. I tried to think of all good stuff. I know as a mom I doubt myself and my actions all the time so I thought it would be nice to show my mom that my perception of my childhood wasn't all bad at all. There were lots of good times and these were my perceptions of them. It goes from asking what your first memory was to the time you laughed the hardest to the best advice she gave you to being a mom. There are spots for photos, but I didn't use those because I scrapbook and all of my photos are in books already."
5,Dance music at its best,"From the opening pulses of 'Dark and Long' through the wonderful melody of 'Dirty Epic' and the instant classic 'Cowgirl, you can be assured of a brilliant experience.One of the few dance albums ever made that you won't find yourself pushing the 'skip' button, every song is enjoyable and different from each other.It's also an album that you can listen to, as well as dance to, actually I find it more enjoyable just to listen to it. There are so many beautiful sounds and textures, it's good to take time out to appreciate the amount of work that has gone into this album.This album is a shining light for the techno genre, it shows that not all techno is boring and loud. An album to savour."
4,"Not too heavy on the electronica please, thanx.","after several years with no new material, underworld came back with much heavier beats that I'd expected, but I'm pleased with their results. Darkness and rhythm pervade this cd, along with catchy riffs and lyrics. Although in the ""electronica"" genre, it's not really all that heavy, there's still some non-mechanical talent making the sound. I keep this album in my car, as the beats lend themselves to late night driving, with freeway lights passing quietly outside your windows.If you liked ""Underneath the radar"" and ""Change the weather"", you'll be pleasantly surprised by this release."
5,Essex the heart of true talent?,"What is it about Essex in the UK that makes me feel like the true UK artistes come from there, Empirion,The Prodigy, Underworld and Twelvetrees (i think). Four of my now favorite acts on this planet (just got 'boy on a cloud' by Twelvetrees.......EXCELLENT!!!!!!) all come from more or less the same area, and they all sound great live too (haven't seen Underworld 'live' yet).....maybe i need to move there for some inspiration....anyone got a spare room?"
5,Excellent Quality worth a few dollars more...,"The G-Tech 500 gb drive is an excellent choice for an external multi-connector hard drive. I use mine only for backup on my iMac 24"" 3 ghz desktop computer. The drive is very well constructed and runs very quiet. Connection and startup was as easy as plugging in the drive to ac current and then connecting the firewire (this one connects with usb as well). The G-Tech company was purchased by another company so you may see other hard drives with similar specs. that have a different company name on them. These drives are very similar with small packaging differences. You will not be disappointed with this product."
1,POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE,"I purchased two G-Drive Combo two years ago.I sent one of them in for repair 3 WEEKS AGO and still haven't been able to get them to tell me what is wrong with my drive. The first two calls they were not able to find my drive, they lost it...After the Third and Fourth call on Friday the customer service guy told me to call back on Monday. He also said to expect to be on hold for about an hour. Each time I call I am on hold for about 20 minutes.DO NOT PURCHASE ANY PRODUCT FROM THIS COMPANY YOU WILL BE SORRY."
5,take it for granted,"Works seemlessly with Mac, stacks nicely (I own 3), and in the last 2 or so years I've never had any problems with this or the 250 GB version.I bought it on a recommendation from a colleague who, working at a photography school, has seen other drives just die. They stressed the importance of the internal fan as heat can = death to hard drives."
4,Good perspective of family origins.,I found this book to be very informative about an area of the world I was not familiar with. My husband's family originally came from Kolbuszowa and it was nice to read about another man and his family residing there and their experiences. It gave me the opportunity to imagine where my family would have lived and what it was like for them.
5,Great Waldorf Teacher Resource,I checked this book out from my library and found many songs I wanted to use in my third/fourth grade split Waldorf classroom and so am ordering the book for myself.
3,Forget the (mediocre) hits and dig the rest of the album.,Shaggy like so many of the gen x 'artists' if you can call them that exhibits no originality on his hit Angel (Oh wow... a remake from a younger artist... i'm shocked.) and then there's the juvenile but catchy It wasn't me. Neither of which is all that great musically. Of course the general public loves them. But when you listen to the rest of the album you hear some nice infectious grooves which are more true to the roots of reggae. Some of those cuts are pretty decent.I just wish that radio stations would play music that is good rather than just the stuff that the (uninformed and uneducated) public craves. Musically and in our society in general we are moving towards only appeasing the least common demoninator. When that happens we all lose in the process.
3,OK CD to me,"This CD to me seemed not bad. I liked 2 of the 12 tracks on it. It's pretty good, but besides those songs- :("
5,HOT!,"He has quite the way with words, thanks to his Jamaican roots. His voice is incredibly sexy (I don't care what other negative reviews say). The beats are fun and easy to move to. It's pop, it's commercial, but it's wonderful!"
4,shaggy - hotshot,"i have to say there are brilliant songs here, the best being ""it wasn't me"". uplifting and cheerful, i have to admit to liking some of these songs even though i don't normally listen to this type of music! its a must for the artist and those who haven't heard it will be struck by some of the lyrics (stupid as some are, and funny!) and its a definite buy"
2,Not such a hotshot after all,"This album is a disappointment. I thought it would be good because I liked the songs ""It Wasn't Me"" and ""Angel"". This is a really bad album. Shaggy gets really annoying by continuously calling himself Mr. Lover and Mr. Hotshot. This is a waste of money and time. The only songs that aren't terrible have already been on the radio. You aren't missing anything by not owning this album."
3,HotShot is GOOD for what it did,"It opened MANY doors that were closed to these artists before this CD came long. A long way they have come but a long, long way to go. If you are looking for a good pop formula this is it. If you are expecting SHAGGY's old style, sadly it is not here. The CD has excellent flow and sound. Enjoy!"
5,A Good beat,"Here is a CD that we can let our children listen to. It has a very good beat even I like to listen to him. This somithing new rap mixed in with some flaver. I have heard some people talk about the song Wasn't Me, I too do not like the song, but you have to look at all the other songs like Angel for instence it is a very positive song. I hope I have convinced you to look at the better half of things."
4,Pop Sound,"I love the record, it seems like a lot of pop, but that is what is in now. The Label had something to do with the sound I'm sure. The Luv me Luv me song is different then the Janet original, it sounds better then ever with the great voice of Samantha Cole. Great music for driving in the car with the windows down."
4,"Not my favorite, but enjoyable","I enjoyed this album because it was mellow enough for me to listen to without being barraged by a bunch of cursing. It is a little bit ""bubble-gummy"", but I like bubble gum! I could even play it at work. Even though I am more of a fan of traditional dancehall, ""Hotshot"" made my workplace "" reggae-friendly""."
4,Shaggy is alright,I bought this CD just to get the hit single ANGEL but I found a lot of other songs that I've heard and loved but I didn't know that Shaggy sang them. GREAT CD!!
1,what a waste,"i bought this cd because a friend recommended it and i still had christmas money to blow. what a waste of my money! the single ""it wasn't me"" got old about twice as fast as ""who let the dogs out"". it's time they stop these one-hit artists from arriving on the scene."
3,"If you loved Boombastic, you'll HATE this","Ok, first up, let me say that I was expecting another fabulous dancehall album like Boombastic...and when I put this cassette into my tape player I was horribly disappointed. The album isn't bad, if you like more of a hip-hop r&b flavour-but if you are expecting a dancehall album, PLEASE pass this by. Get Boombastic instead-it's mainly reggae with a little hip-hop mixed in, but Hotshot is almost pure hip hop, which is not my cup of tea. Proceed with extreme caution."
3,A good listen--but this album does not jam like past efforts,"I've been a huge Shaggy fan since my public radio station started playing OH Carolina years ago. Since then, I've purchased every Shaggy CD. Each CD has its own merit but I personally enjoy the first one the most. This last effort lacks the ""shaginess"" that made the first two albums Rockin Dancehall. It's too pop, too slow, and too far from the roots of the first couple albums. Only a devote Shaggy lover would REALLY enjoy this CD-and despite the lack of a power punch, I do."
4,hot lingo,Great reggae music with equally racey lyrics to some songs. My favorite is the reggae Angel version of Angel in the Morning.
5,"Can you spell ""brilliant""?","Do you like The Replacements? Bob Mould in all his guises? R.E.M.? Then you must be a fan of intelligent songwriting. That being the case then Ultimate Fakebook is for you! What you'll find are intelligent lyrics and the catchiest hooks this side of heaven. All three band members are skilled arrangers and musicians who play as if their very lives are at stake. ""Far, Far Away"", ""Diamond Ring"", ""Downstairs/Arena Rock""...oh, what am I thinking - they're all great! Buy Electric Kissing Parties and their second release - This Will Be Laughing Week - and find out for yourself what we, their adoring fans, already know: UFB absolutely, utterly, and completely rock!"
5,Stellar!,"This recording is wonderful. The songs--some familiar, some not so familiar--are quite heartfelt and warm the soul. ""Island On A Cloud"" is absolutely dreamy as is ""Angel Lullabies."" It's great music to just curl up and listen to. It also is wonderful background dinner music or music to fall asleep by...and dream. I have given this CD as a gift to many friends and the reaction is always the same: ""What a great CD, I love it."" Buy this CD, you won't be disappointed. I can't wait for Ms. Reichert's next recording!"
2,Diamonds do not look like diamonds...,The bracelet is rather bulky and of poor quality. The fabric coating of some sort on the bracelet seems to attract stains rather easily. The diamonds on this watch are of low quality and brillance--they do not sparkle!
5,God Bless to S. Amandeep Singh Madra and Paramjeet Singh,"First of all I would say, God Bless S. Amandeep Singh Madra , who has done this great job for the coming sikh generation,the generation born in abroad and does not know about sikh's pride. Great God bless these two gentlemen for that they just clear the dust from the sikh braverly and showed the new generation by publishing this book, who ever forgott the sikhs culture and pride. I might order this book in large quantity to distribute in each gurudwara, this is Surinderpal Singh , USA"
3,GOOD PRODUCT,Wasn't personally for my use but didn't hear any complaints from ther person that requested it so it must have met their needs.
3,A good product,A little expensive but it is a good product. Too bad I couldn't get this for $10.00 total withh all costs!
3,Hard on skin,"This take is hard on skin if you're doing multiple dressing changes per day. Stickiness is also a problem in that it does not do a good job on contours or rounded parts. Better off with paper tape. ""Hard on skin"" means it will tear your skin off on the sensitive bits. Actually caused bleeding."
4,does what it's supposed to do,"what can you really say about tape? this tape is good quality, and sticks fairly well to skin. tears easily and comes off easily, but does leave residue (i use sticker lifter or goo gone to remove). does a good job of adhering even after getting wet - sometimes it seems as though that makes it stick better. i've used other brands, but i think you're better off spending a little more and getting 3M than wasting money with a cheaper product that only sticks where you don't want it to stick - usually to itself."
5,Great for long distance runners,I have been searching for a solution to a problem I have with chafing of my nipples during long runs. I have tried everything I could find including body glide. Then I read somewhere that this tape actually worked. I have now tried it on long sweaty runs of 12 and 18 miles with no problems at all. All I do is cut it into smaller pieces and apply. It goes on easy and comes off easy even with my hairy chest which is great since I am not going to shave. Problem solved and you almost get a lifetime supply for under $15.00.
4,Nice tape good deal for the price,Would recommend this deal. Tape was a good value for the money. This Item was as described in the ad
1,Don't Buy,"I bought this tape due to great reviews but now I have 12 rolls of tape that will be collecting dust. It did not hold up well at all for me. it is NOT waterproof/sweatproof. Tape would come off with couple hours of wear. I did use it to cover a wart remover adhesive on the palm of my hand so perhaps that may be the reason why it did not work out well. I use the johnson and johnson waterproof tape which works great for the fraction of the price. With the johnson and johnson waterproof tape, I would be able to wash my hand all day long and it would stay put. Mind you I would have to clean the tape area with alcohol before placing the tape but I did the same with Transpore tape also but did not work."
3,"Nice price, strange fit","I like the design on this sweatshirt and I thinkit is a great price. I was however not happy with the fit. I am a women who is a size 8 and I got the XL to have a very roomy sweatshirt. I could barely get the sweatshirt over my head! I heard stitches in the neck opening rip as I slipped it over my head! The neck opening is very small, but the rest of the sweatshirt is VERY generous for the size."
5,GREAT RESOURCE!,"This book is a simple concept with a magical result. There are hundreds of baby name books out on the market, but none like this one. If you're looking for some inspiration for naming your kid, you will find this book a tremendous resource. It is full of poetic, interesting, unique names gathered from all corners of the earth. Even if you don't find THE name for your child in this book, it will give you lots of new ideas and open up the possibilities. The only drawback of this book is that there is very little information on the origins of the names listed--maybe a fascinating project for a revised edition?"
1,Not worth the money!,"Too bad the author didn't offer a money-back guarantee. This book is filled with everyday words that have nothing to do with naming a child. Chimmney and Ajax? Come on! No definitions or pronunciations were given either. Even the ""From the experts"" section on the back of the book with comments from Dr. Spock and Dr. Brazelton stunned me. The only things these experts had to say was that they did not have enough time to comment. I just want to warn other parents interested in this book to try something else such as The Everything Baby Names Book by Lisa Shaw."
5,The Santa Fe in Colorado,"This book is no. 23 in the prestigious annual publications of the Colorado Railroad Museum. It details the arrival of the AT&SF Railroad in Colorado with the major portion of the book being dedicated to the history of the Raton Pass section of the line. It is heavily illustrated with excellent black and white photography, including a section on the steam engines that worked the area. Photography is almost exclusively of the steam era. No history of the Santa Fe and specifically Raton Pass is complete without this volume. Hardback, 296 pages."
4,a good choice for quick and dirty learning,"hands you the basics to acquire the sentences you need to move around in a french speaking country. unless it has this title, don't buy, as a later version has a flaw in the cd."
1,wow,I Would like to say this sample sucked it did not teach you any thing lame sucky boringy lamey i might not get it
1,Really?,"It would be great if the only sample you get to hear before buying the book had ANYTHING to show for how the language is taught, rather than just a cheesy story promising being helpful without any sort of proof."
5,Great Deodorizing Dispenser,"Designed for neutralizing heavy odors of smoke and dog kennels, clubs, hotels, basements, breakrooms, etc. this unit is battery-operated (2 Cs), noiseless and unobtrusive. It can be set to operate for 12 or 24 hrs. at 7, 15, or 25 minutes. Much, much better than the residential units now being sold."
4,Very Funny!!!,"I just watched this movie and I thought it was incredibly funny and was a lot better than I had expected. Eugene and Cindi are the perfect couple and on prom night, Cindi wants to take their relationship to the next level, but unfortunately, Eugene falls down a flight of stairs and puts him into a 4-year coma. He is woken up by his best friend, Tucker who is obsessed with Playboy. When they see Cindi posing in a Playboy magazine, they try to make their way to the Mansion to see if Cindi still cares for Eugene. Along the way, they get into hilarious misadventures such as alluding Firemen, burning down a hotel, and driving a car with lesbians in the back seat. I highly recommend MISS MARCH!!!"
3,Miss March,Miss March is a decent movie. Not everyone will enjoy it but it will be one of those movies that goes on demand on you watch it just to see how it it. The movie starts off with two little kids finding a playboy in a brothers box. From there off Tucker( Trevor Moore) spends his whole life off the playboy magazine.I am not going to say much about the movie except that it was not a Best Comedy award.
1,Zero stars. Stupid as anything.,"This movie is garbage. Don't think because there is a pretty girl on the front that this is anything you'll like. Actually, it's probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen."
1,Worst Movie Ever!!!!!!,"This movie blows, there were two funny moments in the entire film, no nudity, worst acting you'll ever see, it stunk!"
1,Not very good!,"At the local red box the other night i rented ""Miss March"" for a dollar. Unfortunately i didn't care too much for it. It feels like a whole unfunny skit of ""The Whitest kids you know"". It does offer some original laughs but it's lousy plot kicks in and you spend 90 minutes watching characters you really don't care for. In the end, if you must watch a movie I recommend this. But for renting only. I'm so happy I rented this and didn't buy it. P.S. I'm a huge ""whitest kids you know"" fan! Hopefully there next film won't be as dumb."
2,I laughed a few times,"I'm struggling to find one redeeming quality about this movie...I really am. Sure I chuckled a few times, but in the end I was left scratching my head and asking, ""Did I really just sit through that?"" The lead characters Eugene (Zach Cregger) and Tucker (Trevor Moore) were over the top at times and obnoxiously whiney at others. How many times can two guys scream like girls?The only part that was decent was the cameo Hefner gave. As another poster stated he gave a good performance (or just acted as himself) and delivers a simple explanation about how to treat women.I guess with these movies it's hit or miss and this one just missed for me. In the end I decided to give it two stars for the few laughs I did manage to let out and for Hef. Would I watch it again? Never. Am I mad I watched it once? Na."
3,If you enjoy The Whitest Kids U Know ...,"... then I suspect you'll enjoy this. To be sure, it's not a true WK movie in either lineup or tone -- there is little here as outrageous as the WK's signature bits -- but while I detest much of the horny-kids genre this firmly occupies, I nevertheless loved the purity of its stupidity and enjoyed Moore as its main exponent and Cregger as his frequent victim. Granted, it doesn't all operate at the highest level, but there are small, classic bits here and one of them has already worked its way to reference-point status in our house. It's that weird and that memorable."
3,It has it's place,Not the best movie ever made but doesn't claim to be either. Some of the jokes were really funny and some not so much. If you find it cheap then give it a go but don't pay full price or even close to it for the movie.
3,Ok Movie,"I have no life and watch a lot of movies. This one is no more or no less than a young male adolescents dream. It's cool to watch, kinda funny and of course there is hot women. So if your bored, by all means, rent it."
5,Lovingly re-packaged space-rock masterpiece,"Hawkwind have recorded so many albums in their 30-or-so yearhistory -- and 23 have charted -- that it's difficult for the casualbuyer to decide which to get.Although recorded in the same era,this album does not contain the 'Silver Machine' single, but it hasthe same epic qualities. The packaging has been wonderfully assembled-- looking back, I now see the enormous influence that this album hadon the designers of the 'Warhammer' games. Personally, I would havepreferred not to have the inclusion of the last four extra tracks,however rare they might be. The first seven tracks made up anintegrated whole, and the extra tracks aren't in the same vein.Butthis is marvellous space-rock.... I don't find the recording qualitypoor, but it is 28 years since I first bought the LP....It's great to have the album on CD now. I doubt whether Hawkwind everintended this stuff to be played on car stereos, but it's superbmotorway driving material."
4,"Not True Hawkwind, but it still ROCKS","I went to my local Twist and Shout(actually its pretty far away) to get CDs that I can't find at such places like Best Buy. The true reason I went there was for a Hawkwind CD. I was really trying to find Space Ritual Volume 1 or even Leviathan but this was the only CD they had. So, naturally, I bought it. Its a great CD, Space Is Deep, Urban Gurrilla, Lord of Light...Dam, all the songs are awesome. Though, I really like true Hawkwind a lot better, all songs have that certain space feel but some have it more than others. Definently Space Is Deep and Lord of Light are the best songs on this album, even Brainbox Pollution aswell. If your interested in Hawkwind, this CD is probably a good place to start, at least...for me."
5,Great CD,"I loved this tape as a child, and just purchased it in CD format for my mom who also loves it. Edgar Cruz is very talented."
5,Excellent Sensitivity Resource,"This is exceptional resource for all to learn the mindset of American Catholics. Too often we assume they are back in the Reformation times, and they don't consider themselves there at all.Thus, to approach them this book is an invaluable source. Well written, historically accurate, this is insight into American Catholic ethos at its best!"
4,Fun Accessories for Your Holga,"These color filters are fun to enhance your color photos, blue makes water and the sky look really blue for example. For pictures taken at night, the filters have a dramatic effect. I like them!"
3,Doesn't come with the holder,I thought it would come with the filter holder shown in the picture. It doesn't. You must purchase separately. Good otherwise.
4,Good for beginner,"Got this book when I needed to ramp on Red Hat Linux fast. Good beginner book. In the best traditions of Wrox ""Beginning... "" series, well written, assumes no prior Linux knowledge, worth every penny. Not a programming book, but an excellent title for administrator who wishes to get comfortable with Linux basics. Awsome coverage on RHT,basic terminal, light on setup, setup problems."
2,Weak on setup,"I just started this book and right off the bat I have a major complaint. Now understand I'm a newbie to Red Hat Linux. Most newbies dual boot from one hard drive to either Windows or Linux. This book offers absolutely no info on partitioning your HD to accommadate two operating systems. So beginners beware. I had to purchase ""Red Hat Linux 9 in 24 hours"" to walk me through the setup. Wrox Press is usually more thorough, especially with their ""beginner"" books."
1,This is not what you will expect about bicycling,"I was so disappointed when I bought this book for my husband. He loves to bike and read about others' adventures, but this was nothing but a man mostly remembering his sexual encounters. What a waste of time and money!"
3,DV-5500 vs DV-5300,"I bought both the Aiptek DV-5300 and the Mustek DV-5500 from Amazon... not to have both but to evaluate them and pick the ""best one""... the price was a little more for the Mustek, but only by $40 or so. The Mustek worked well and the 2.5"" LCD was very, very nice. The 1.5"" LCD on the Aiptek is small and is not as nice as the Mustek. Both took nice pics... video and stills. But the Mustek was MUCH bigger and MUCH heavier than the DV-5300. If size doesn't matter to you, then you might want to get the Mustek. One other note: the shutter release for the Mustek really has to be push in hard... and that made the camera move on me and caused some blurry pics... the Aiptek uses a micro-switch and is MUCH easier to depress. Hope this helped youl"
1,Don't buy this camera,I strongly agree this camera sucks. The time stamp has a mind of it's own and regularly changes to a random time stamp. The controls are extremely difficult to use. Amazon was kind enough to replace it but the replacement has all the same problems. Mustek's suggestion to shut off the auto-focus during video recording had no effect. The playback was still noisy with clicks and burps. This piece of junk deserves 0 stars. If you think the zoom feature is continuous you will be disappointed. The zoom function click stops at four zoom levels only which looks ridiculous on playback. Every single function sucks and there is absolutely no use for this camera. Please save yourself the aggravation and DON'T BUY THIS CAMERA!!!!!
2,loser,"when I received the camera it had a great solid feel,charged the battery shot some video footage,the main reason for buying it,I wasn't interested in the other functions long story short,the motor has a very loud noise during the taping & watching playback,the worst part was turning it off, it had a mind of it's own, sent it back, hope this review helprd!"
1,what to say!,"Well in a nutshell, my intel webcam that i've bought 2 yrs ago for 40$ has a better quality that this one! Couldnt focus, even with the highest quality. When i used it as a webcam, bad resolution too! Not recommended. Be aware."
1,Sad camera,"This camera sucks, I'm on my second camera and it still sucks. The video (which can only be filmed in asf format) keeps crashing my video editing software. I create animations for multimedia and know there is no fault with my system. The shutter placement means the 7 out of 10 pictures are blurry. MP3 playback is real tinny. I have no use for it, my supplier is refusing to admit that it doesn't do what it says on the box. I may stamp on it to get some kind of satisfaction from it. I think all the positive reviews here are written by one crank!"
1,Not worth the headache,"I've had this camera for 6 days and I have already had to return it. It wouldn't stay on.....just kept shutting off. Mustek kept giving me the run around when I tried to return it, and then had the nerve to ask for 3 copies of my receipt. I can't tell ya how well the camera performs cause I haven't had the chancec to use it, but so far its a big fat Zero."
1,"Holy, Worst buy ever","Wow at first this camera looked great got it worked for a week and then the focus broke, so i thought no big deal ill refund it for a new one. Get the new one and pow the stupid thing dosnet charge. So im really mad, never buy this camera. Im getting my money back, Amazon should take this off there website its losing them sales. I dont care if i came with a tripod and software, how are u gona use it if you have no camera."
1,Video Quality,It is onlyLow 30fpsEconomy 25fpsFine 10fpsNot 30fps like it claims at its highest quality. Buyer beware.
1,SUCKS!,"I bought it, IT works fine in good lighting condishons. other than that IT SUCKS! Focus sucks, after about 5 feet its gets blurry and My files Cept on geting corrupted in the camera. It frezzes alot. Dont buy it at all."
1,Don't Buy Is A Ripoff Of Poco Material,Poco doesn't get revenue from this. Buy Keeping The Legend Alive. GREAT ALBUM.
5,Wireless Security,"Wow, this book covers so much material with such depth, accuracy and clarity. It aided me tremendously in my thesis at the university. Therefore, I must graciously thank the authors for the truly amazing work which they have done with this book. I recommend it to all students focusing on wireless security and its future potentials ."
3,"Good, but predictable","Open Range is a great change of pace Western that makes for an easy and entertaining read. It's short, fun, and absolutely nothing that taxes one's brain. Open Range chronicles the adversity experienced by two independent, yet amiable freegrazers in the twilight of the old American West. The veteran cowhand Boss Spearman and his protege Charley Waite make their way in the open West while herding and raising cattle in the open land - much to the displeasure of the local reprobate cowhand magnate and his puppet marshal.A classic Western book without any surprising and exciting twists and turns, Open Range is much different in book form than the actual movie itself. In a true rarity, I actually enjoyed the movie moreso and found it to be more compelling. That being said, I still enjoyed the book and recommend it to anyone who enjoys Westerns or who is looking for a fun, quick, and easy read. See the movie afterwards and be your own judge."
4,Yeah,"Husband said ""good book"" Lives up to his expectations and he knows about historical westerns from reading Louis L' amour."
3,Shorter than what I thought,"They are a little shorter than what I had thought so for some of my styles, they don't work but for the rest and majority, it does the job."
5,Really good! Strong hold!,I really liked these bobby pins. Much better than regular store bobby pins. These actually hold and last me for a very long time. Really satisfied with this product!
3,strong.,i like these for the most part. they def. hold but i think they would hold better if they were longer! they seem short to me and it makes it hard to take them outta my hair for the reason. good product though.
4,Let's see how long these last,"I swear bobby pins grow legs are run away while i'm not watching. I usually buy a pack, and in a week or two i'm completely out! they tend run out when i mostly need them, and then i find myself looking in every corner of my room to find one. I bought this big pack hoping it last. The pins are great. However, they have a weird smell, but it goes away."
1,Marianna Bobby Pins,"These bobby pins are absolutely horrible! They are impossible to open without bending out of shape much less get them into your hair. When I did get them into my thick, fine textured hair they just slid right out. These pins are just too frustrating to even mess with especially when trying to complete retro looks with pin curls, suicide rolls, or barrel curls when you cannot let got of your hair to jack around with cheaply made pins. I threw the entire box away and spent half the money at the grocery store getting a different set that was better better quality. Don't waste your money on these folks!"
4,Good,"The bobby pins seem to be very sturdy and the coating should last a long time, unlike my old pins that would flake off and snag my hair. However, when I open the bobby pin it twists and makes it difficult to place in my hair. Maybe once they have been used a few times this will change...."
4,"Pins were out of order in box, kind of expensive.",These are worth the money though! Keep my hair up. I am determined not to lose them. I wish they came with 1000 instead of 700 :(
5,Fantastic!!,"If you can imagine a young Steve Lawrence, then you can imagine Mike Clifford!! Best known for ""Close To Cathy"", he had quite an impressive output and nearly everything on this album is well worth a listen. He was even in the Broadway production of ""Grease""...He was THAT good. If you remember ""Close To Cathy"" and ""One Boy Too Late"" and you can find this beauty, BUY IT!!"
5,Holmes as he should be --Basil Rathbone,"This four set collection of the classic Sherlock Holmes movies is a must for any fan of the great detective. Dressed to Kill, Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon, Terror by Night and The Woman in Green have never been better portrayed as well as Rathbone and Bruce bring these great detectives to life."
2,Old serial shows,I purchased this thinking it had the complete collection. It was mostly the old series from early tv days.
2,ok,bought for 93 year old father uninspired by current tv. He was disappointed but still trying to find good Sherlock Holmes viewing.
4,Hard Driving Musical Expertise,"Better strap in for this one. It's fast and heavy until the final track. Enjoy the driving bass, and listen carefully to one of the best drummers in the business! This group proves wrong anyone who claims metal bands have no talent."
2,BAD!!!,"I beg you, if you're a Tourniquet fan, or even just a fan of good metal, please don't bother with this album. The new lead singer is bad, and the music doesn't seem to have the feeling of the older albums. Buy anything they released before this, and leave their new stuff alone."
5,it rocks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,this cd kicks but. the guitar work is fanatastic. the lyrics are awesome. my fav. song is k517. it is a drum solo but he is the best in the world. all around this cd rocks.
5,the king of them all !,"very strong performance from the godfather of soul way back in 1981.the first time i saw him live was during this tour.part of this show was broadcasted on french t.v. in 1981, this is the complete thing. sound and picture are very good and i also has the j.b. international's opening the show.more bonustracks from another montreux gig j.b. did.the boss is on the good foot and shows all of his shuffle's and other fancy footwork even some full splits !what can i say BUY IT !!!ron roelofsenwww.greatest-jamesbrown-videotradinglist.com"
4,james brown live montreuex 1981,"great vintage performance from the godfather , bit like a bootleg ? but ex sound and pic , negative on this , does NOT have the bonus trax has promised from pre -sale info , but for the price hard core JB fans you just gotta have it , its similar to the beat club show of the same year , but with a bigger audience , need to ask amazon why they promise bonus traxwhen there aint non? but for the money buy it , funky .p"
2,Disappointed,"The biggest disappointment with ""James Brown: Live In Montreux"" was the song selection and the lack of his famous showmanship. I kept waiting for him to kick it up a notch and then it ended. Disappointing."
3,Shape was perfect but...,"Shape was a good fit but it was so stiff, not flexible. I will order again. I found out it's compatible with the other name brand items with same dimension."
4,excellent,"Shhhh! Come here. Listen. I have been on a secret mission to find Andy Pratt albums without paying through the snout since I gotRecords Are Like Life. And...........I just found this on wax in a dollar bin--there was gold in there, and now it's mine.This self-titled album is not quite as sophisticated as the aforementioned, which is like listening to a singer-songwriter version of Coltrane's `Giant Steps, with its winding DNA chords and maze song architecture.This album is a little more streamlined, with structures that don't quite mutate as much or as fast. But this is no James Taylor or Carol King affair, and the playing, singing and writing is top notch, even if some of Pratt's artsy edges are, unfortunately, beveled.Still, this is a great album that is far above most."
3,Hit & Miss,"Considering his longevity in European politics, Andreotti has so much to offer. Yet he delves too far into the minutia of his life in foreign affairs and domestic politics rather than giving the broad sweep of history.These defects aside, his chapter on the Achille Lauro incident -the worst period in U.S.-Italy post-War relations - is captivating. If nothing else, read that chapter & skip the rest."
3,how?,i am not brain dead but i am brain injured (1968)i have listened to the cd and find the last part irritaing. why? i dont know. how is it supposed to work? maybe i am not hearing what others are hearing. no doubt. i was diagnosed to have central auditory processing disorder. that alone is a difficult concept. hyperacusis is another difficult concept. so i have a big prblem with speech sounds and the sound of a television drives me raving insane. be careful not to hit your head! how is Brain Power supposed to work? am i supposed to be irritated or is there something wrong with my cd player?Jean SmithPollock Pines CA(530) 363- 8125
4,New To Music and Memory Enhancement Phenomena,"I bought this CD with Deep Learning by the same author and it has been very beneficial. I haven't listened to this CD as much as Deep Learning and do not quite know the difference between the two. I am not an expert of this phenomena, so, the background music between the Brain Power and Deep Learning sounds quite similar. For $13 and some change, if my capacity to learn improve by 1%, then, it is worth my investment. I gave a 4 out of 5 because of my lack of knowledge in the music."
1,Find phone drivers before buying this,I have yet to find drivers for my Katana phone to get this working. I would wait until you are sure you have working software and phone drivers because the disk sent with this cable does not contain what is needed. The Gomadic company forgot to send me the cable and only sent the tip jack. They promptly sent me the cable after I emailed them.
5,Extensive research done on this compound,"We have been taking Vit. E Succinate for a while for its anti tumor effect. Of all over the counter compounds, this one deserves a good review."
4,Acceptance 2000 EP,"This six song EP shows the diverse talent that this band 'Acceptance' has to offer. The entire CD only goes for 35 odd minutes but the quality of the songs are terrific. This young band that dabbles inbetween emo and alt rock beats shows alot of promise. 'I believe', 'Things You Say' and 'Torn Inside' are utterly beautiful songs that deal with love and relationships. The lyrics are meaningful and the listener will be able to identify with a song or songs from this album release. It is a beautiful album with six equally succinct songs that will leave the listener a fan of this budding alt rock band from the USA."
4,Acceptance - Old vd. New,"This CD is rad. Great songs and a really unique sound. This is the only ""emo"" band that all my emo-hating friends will listen to. I just got a copy of the new record, Black Lines To Battlefields and its probably going to be my top record of the year. OK i lied, i didnt get the new record actually, I downloaded it from P2P. But I WILL buy it when it comes out."
4,understand this is a good album,"i consider myself a purveyor of good music. i have a taste for most everything, and when i heard these guys (they are lable mates with ""gatsbys american dream"" another awesome band) i had to check it out. and i must say i am completely satisfied with the album. soaring melodies, mournful guitar lines. i love it. ""things you say"" (by far the best song i've heard in a while) made me love the band that much more. a rockin mix of everything of need in your music diet (and i'd have to say they listen to the juliana theory, you can definitely hear the first album [understand] coming through). if you like good music pick this up."
4,I still refer to the previous edition,"I bought the Access 2000 version of this book in 2001. It was very helpful in getting started with Access programming. Don't take the fast timetable too seriously. I found it covered well how to get started on each subject, after which the net was a good reference source. I still refer to it, and copied some useful code, eg for selecting files."
1,"""Crash"" on page 10","After downloading the CheckWriter DB from Wiley's companion site for the book Access 2003 Programming Weekend Crash Course, I try and try but it will not run; it cannot find the linked files; and the ""tools"" for reference and linking are greyed out. So we ""Crash"" on page 10. How can the author claim he is teaching us Professional Techniques when his program will not run out of the box?"
2,Bad transfer to digital,"This book may have good content but the transfer to digital format created so many errors that it is almost impossible to read. The part that I read seemed good, but I gave up trying to read it after a very short period. I would not waste my time."
3,Now we know what happened to the Dodos!,I was dissapointed in many ways with this book. I loved The Red Tent and was hoping for a similar story based upon the Bible. Instead it was so far-fetched it seemed like a comedy in areas. Some parts were good but then something ridiculous or obscure would be thrown in leaving me ready to put the book down. I finshed it because it was for my book club and I am interested to hear the other thoughts on this book.
3,Lost in Translation?,"Although the subject matter was interesting, and yes, though provoking, the writing style was not enjoyable. Perhaps that is due in part to reading a translated version of the book."
3,Not the Ark you think you know.,Not the Ark as we learned it. Good reading but very fiction. Not religious in any way. Stay with it. Good ending.
3,In the Shadow of the Ark,"A well told tale with good description. It is hard to retell the Biblical stories, but I think the author did a pretty good job. It held my interest, but I am not sure that I would recommend it to others, I just don't know."
2,In the Shadow of the Ark,I really did not enjoy this book as much as I had hoped. I thought the plot line plodding and uninteresting. I have enjoyed other Anne Provoost's books more.
1,Sordid and Depraved,"I hated this book. And I am in no way a follower of ""the unnameable one"". I enjoyed The Red Tent and will continue to seek out that type of fiction among others, because I found it interesting.I only got through this because I listnened on audio, and boy do I wish I had listened to something else for that ten hours. The beginning was somewhat interesting, realistically laying out how this ark building and filling business would have taken place. If this would be made into a movie it would have to be rated ""NC-17"". And not in a good way. Rape after overly convenient suicide after beating after rape. I kept waiting for some slight ray of light to come through. It never did. We just ended up getting a big dose of justification for racism, like a slap in the face. I found it sickening. Maybe I shouldn't have been surprised at that, considering the source material! Do yourself a favor and avoid it."
1,A Disappointment,"Though initially intrigued by the title, I regretted wasting time with this book. It excelled in only one particular; depicting ugliness in all its sordid detail. The author so grossly distorts virtually every detail of the Noah story from the Biblical narrative that it becomes meaningless, and the author's point a total mystery. Her characters, even her protagonists, are two-dimensional and without appeal, her ""heroes"" people who rage against righteousness without displaying any understanding of the concept. Altogether a poorly executed effort, with some disturbing anti-Semitic overtones."
1,A waste of time.,"A ridiculous story, that falls so far away from the shadow of the ark that I strongly advise you not to even waste your time. This is so far away from the Biblical story and full of idolatry, that any comment more thorough then this is not worthy of my time.Stay far away from this book."
1,An Alarmingly False Depiction of Noah's Story,"Beware of this book if you have any interest in historical accuracy. A lot of the content is inappropriate, and ridiculous if you take the Biblical account into consideration. Provoost depicts the people in the land as undeserving of their punishment while Noah and his family take part in all kinds of sin, including idol worship, adultery, rape, homosexual acts, murder, etc."
1,SUCKED!,"WOW! What a crappy book. She is really trying to take after ""The Red Tent"" and didn't do a good job at all. It made no sence, and didn't follow the bible. Only Moses and his family was saved, no one else. I'm sorry that I bought it, and if I could sell it--I would."
4,nice!!!!,well made just like the exact pair I bought over 40 years ago....too bad Latin Percussion isn't made in Latin America...
4,Old fashioned goodness,"Well, I must have been on a Ray Conniff kick when I bought these pair of CD's. ""I thought they were a good value and they were. I lost my Ray Conniff albums from long ago - either lost them or got borrowed permanently by friends and family. Anyway, the music is great and it takes me back to a simpler time. I don't listen to the CD's as often as I should but at least they're there when the mood comes back."
4,It worked everytime,"I started using this product 2 years ago. It gave me immediate result. It was effective and gentle enough not to upset your system. Every 6-8 months or so when my body starts to show signs of weakness and being sluggish due to toxin buildup, I would go through one cleansing cycle with it."
4,This product works,"Works great... Only use every couple days, found everyday use after a couple of weeks just me made too loooose!if you know what I mean....."
4,colon cleanse,"Have been taken for 2 yrs, though cutting back on intake. Find it very beneficial, have noticed a decrease in my cholestorol, will continue to take with my apple cider vinegar"
3,Underwhelmed vs what simple magnesium tablets will do ...,"I've taken various clensing tablet systems over the many years and thought I would try this one out rather than my normal brand. As title says, not really sure what it does as it didn't seem any better than taking some magnesium tablets along with fiber. Wasn't any worse mind you ... but for the money. I'd recommend saving money and just getting some magnesium tablets and a soluble/insoluble fiber and use that instead."
2,7 Days little results,I started taking this product 7 days ago exactly as directed and have only had 2 BM's during that time. I eat healthy and maintain a healthy lifestyle. I had high hopes for this product to help in elimating toxins in my body but so far I have been disappointed. I am going to continue taking this for 1 more week and see if I get any results.
3,ultimate cleanse,"I've been on it for almost a week and so far it has done nothing but give me cramps. I've been drinking plenty of water to supplement the intake of the pills, but I haven't had any 'magical' BM's at all. In fact, it's made me go less. I've only gone four times this whole week."
4,2 PART CLEANSE SET,"THE PILLS SEEM TO WORK WITHOUT ANY EXTREME SIDE EFFECTS. I DID NOT HAVE TO ""RUN"" TO THE RESTROOM EVERYTHING WAS NATURAL...OF COURSE I AM CERTAIN THAT DIET/HEALTH CONDITIONS/CURRENT PRESCRIPTIONS/ETC MAY CAUSE YOU TO HAVE DIFFERENT RESULTS. I WOULD DEFINITELY RECCOMEND THIS PRODUCT AS A LAXATIVE AND TEMPORARY CLEANSE WHILE EATING NORMALLY. IT MIGHT PRODUCE MORE INTENSE RESULTS IF YOU ATE A CERTAIN DIET WHILE TAKING THE TABLETS, HOWEVER I HAVE BOUGHT CLEANSE KITS THAT WERE MUCH STRONGER. IT'S ALL A MATTER OF WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE. THIS WOULD BE A GOOD STARTER KIT FOR SOMEONE WHO WAS A FIRST TIME CLEANSER."
4,Critical Aspect Of Wellness,"If you don't cleanse on a regular basis - you will not be at maximum wellness. In the world we live in today, we are bombarded with toxins everyday from the air we breath, food we might eat, water we might drink, personal care/hygiene products, cleaners, carpets, etc - we cannot escape them - so we need to get rid of them. Ultimate cleanse is a great way to begin a good cleansing of the entire system. I use this product myself and with clients all the time. very few have any trouble with it - some we do start out slower than the instructions anbuild up to full dosage. Do you know by the age of 50 the average person has 10-15 pounds of waste built up in them. this can cause nothing but trouble. For those of you who remember John Wayne, he had aqn almost unbelievable 60 pounds of waste impacted in him upon his death. GET IT OUT BEFORE IT TAKES YOU OUT![...]"
3,ok for a short while,"It was only helpful for a short while then it was back to same symptoms of digestive problems. At least I had smooth bowel movements and I had no hemorrhoids and I felt relatively great but I wanted a longer relief than just two weeks. I just had to try something and I had a feeling I had parasites because I had all of the symptoms, but I will keep searching for the best product out there."
2,Worked for 3 days thens topped working,"I am giving this 2 Stars ONLY because for three days it worked. I took it for 2 weeks & after the first 3 days, it didn't do a THING. I followed the instructions, increased every other day, etc. I saw NOTHING after the 3rd day."
3,Not working this time.,"I used this product a couple of years ago and it worked fine -- pretty much as predicted. Now I am getting no change at all after 10 days. Not even the normal. I do feel better, lighter, sort of. As if toxins have left. But I sure can't figure how. Bad batch? Go ahead and give it a try. Oh, the company does not answer its mail. I wanted to ask them which of their cleansing products can be taken together and about this product not working as predicted. Nothing."
1,Ultimate Cleanse,Just doesn't work.I thought it was no better than using an occasional stool softener.I was very disappointed after having read the sales pitch for this product.
3,Okay,"The pills are huge. And you have to take more then one, usually about three of each. It takes about a few days for the product to begin working. I did notice less bloating. That is about it. Overall the product is ok. There was no cramping of any sort."
1,Horrible,"If your thinking about getting this, becuase of the review rating, think again. This stuff is terrible. It did nothing but give me a stomach ache. I'm not a huge health fanatic that knows all about the detox and clease process. A year ago I took Yerba Prime and it worked really well. I decided to try this one, becuase it was cheaper. Well you definitely get what you pay for. I do not recommend this product at all. Horrible!!"
4,did the job,"This product is a great cleanser that you will find out very quick flushes your system. I do not think it is healthy to use this over long periods of time given its stress on your liver. I just eats lots of fruits and veggies now as opposed to supplements, but i think this option is a lot healthier than other products out there."
2,Didn't work as promised,"I've been on it for a week now and I'm going to stop taking it. It does help to go softer, but I'm only going once a day now..instead of my usual 2 or 3. I took it because it promised a good cleaning out. I'm getting the opposite and this can't be good for me. I give it 2 stars because the pills are easy to swallow and I notice I sleep better at night. Something in it must be causeing that. Overall, I wasted my money."
4,Works as claimed!,"I have been on the product for 3 weeks as of this writing; and, it works as it claims. I am regular for the first time in memory ( I am 62). I definitely feel less bloating,less cramping, and thankfully, less constipation. My personal regimen is to take 1 herbal and 1 fiber the first thing in the morning before breakfast. I am good for the day. I have more energy and I like the way my GI tract is on a normal balance each day."
5,Ultimate Cleanse is a lifesaver!,"This is the best fiber/cleanse supplement I have ever tried. I suffer with IBS and have many colon problems that run in my family. This product has saved my life! It does not cramp you up like laxatives do, and it really pretty gentle if you find your correct dosage. The price is right too! I highly recommend this product."
1,Side effects,"I was a fairly long time user of this product and loved it because it was effective and, I thought, safe for extended use. Then I went for my first colonoscopy and was told by my doctor that I had Melanosis coli which is caused by using products with senna and cascara sagrada bark. She said that, if I didn't stop using the product, she would not be able to see anything on the lining of my colon due to the pigmentation changes. I have never seen anything about this in the product information and have now stopped using the product."
3,not bad,I've been on this cleansing program for about 2 weeks. I sometimes feel my intestines being squeezed but I think it's psychological. In all I think it works depending on the how many pills you take. You start off with one of each (the herb and fiber) and then increase it until you have a couple bowel movements per day. I take 3 of each pill in the morning and night and I really don't want to take more even though it doesn't seem to do what it says except make me feel like I have a constant stomachache. It's really bearable but just seems like a lot of pills to put in my body. But since it's temporary I suppose it is okay.
1,worst out of 4 I have tried,"Didn't work for me, sometimes had cramps and little bowel movements. Just tried Yerba for women (with Bentonite clay) and it is just under my favorite(western botanicals i think, that uses charcoal)but way less cost."
2,For me... nothing special.,For all the effort and risk of putting this into my body it wasn't worth it. Not saying that it won't work for you though.
2,Going another week before making a final review,I received exactly what I wanted/ordered. Thanks for saving me time and money!
4,Consistently Good,"I have enjoyed every book in the Joshua Croft series. This, the third, struck me as a bit less memorable than the others, but I still very much enjoyed it and would probably rank it 4.5 stars if Amazon allowed for such rankings. In this book Croft is asked to take on the ""missing persons"" case in which a woman has disappeared with her child. The woman is the ex-wife of a Hollywood star, and she had accused him of child molestation. A court found the star not guilty, which is when the woman and child disappeared. The ex-husband wants Croft to find the missing pair, but Croft won't work for him.Croft does, however, decide to work for the star's uncle, a member of the crime scene in Santa Fe -- that is, a member of the criminal side of that scene. As Croft and his boss, Rita Montdragon, investigate, the case broadens to include assassinations, undercover feds, and illegal immigration. All of the Joshua Croft stories are worth reading: this one is no exception."
4,Natural Science Glitter Sand Art Kit,I bought this for my daughter. She really likes it. The only thing is that it did not take that long to do. If you are looking for something that will take a couple of hours this is not the item for you. If you are looking for an item that takes 30 minutes then it is worth it.
3,They are delicious but...,"These bars are delicious, you really believe that you are eating a chocolate bar, it's not a lie, its flavour is wonderful. They are a good option for snacks and before the exercise. However, I consider that they are a little expensive, bigger and contains more grams of carbs than other bars. I prefer others than these."
1,BLEH!!!,"Sure the nutritional numbers look good, but this is by far the most disgusting-tasting bar I've ever had...like eating epoxy! Just sickly sweet, and plastic-flavored.Powerbar Protein Plus and MetRx taste better, but the best tasting ones I've had were Cliff Body Builder Bar and Detour."
5,Excellent sampling of the first 13 years of Wax Trax Records,"I shucked out 70 bucks for the limited steel box edition of this set, only to have it stolen, and I promptly went right out and bought it again. If you like hearing the origins of industrial, techno, and oddly enough, the KLF, this would be a welcome addition to your collection. It has quite a few tracks that you won't find anywhere except a used record shop, and even then, you may not find what you want. With tracks ranging from Coil, to Ministry (in their pop-music phase), to the ever popular Divine, KMFDM, and various mutations of bands mixed with other bands, there is even a handy booklet with the history, pictures, and members of each incarnation of this great label. From their beginnings as a little store-front in Denver, to a full-fledged company in Chicago, this is an interesting piece of musical history."
4,good buy,I have bought this for 5 nieces/nephews for college use. All have used it for whole 4 years. Colors are nice and bright on the trim.
4,Prime source for learning Centering Prayer,"In this writing, Father Thomas Keating very carefully and completely offers a newly-edited version of what is considered a primary source for learning Centering Prayer. As the early proponent of this type of prayer that can lead greater joy in entering the presence of God, Keating has once again explained in great detail how the practice of engaging in Centering Prayer can be of benefit. His work is the definitive source of terminology and understanding for the contemplative who wants to engage seriously in this deep form of prayer."
3,"Good for pronunciation, but not much else...","Though Latin is usually thought of as a written language rather than a spoken one, learning to pronounce a language is a very helpful tool for learning. If this is all you are looking for, you are in the right place. Many examples are given of both secular and church prounciation, but don't expect to find any kind of grammar or other language instruction. This is a resource soley for those that are learning Latin from a book and want to know more about how it should be pronounced."
3,Better resources.,"This is a good tool for learning about Latin phrases used in English. However, I have found more comprehensive tools for learning Latin pronunciation for free on the Web."
2,Nothing learned. A bit of pronunciation gleened perhaps.,"This thankfully brief lesson in Latin offers very little in the way of actual instruction. The pauses between speakers is too short to repeat the phrases they are purportedly trying to teach you.The cassettes do give the listener a simplistic language lesson in the applications of Latin and you can pick up on some aspects of both classic and modern church Latin pronunciation through the rapid attempts to repeat the phrases offered.My biggest complaint is that many of the phrases are far too long to be repeated all at once, yet the speaker does not pause in the middle to let you repeat portions of it.Overall, i would say these lessons are not actually for learning Latin, rather for picking out bits and pieces of Latin that you already know."
2,Misrepresentation,This is not very helpful in learning Latin. It is helpful in learning latin phrases used sparaticly thoughout english.
3,Technical perfection,"I have enjoyed jazz-rock fusion ever since seeing the Mahavishnu Orchestra perform back in 1972. I also had the privilege of seeing Chick Corea and Return to Forever on the Romantic Warrior tour a few years later.I cannot get into the Elektric Band. There's no denying it, each musician on stage is a virtuoso, and their playing is tight as a drum. I'm impresssed by the skill and accuracy but I FEEL nothing - the music has the emotional appeal of balancing a checkbook. Kind of extremely well played elevator music. Still, the audience seems to eat it up, and more power to them. Maybe I'm missing the point and just don't ""get it""I wish Chick would consider regrouping with Al Dimeola, Stanley Clark and Lenny White. Now there was a group that could play better than anyone AND made powerful, memorable music."
4,Chick Corea Elektric Band: Live at Montreux 2004,"Good DVD. Nice overall sound.The crew is leaving no notes unplayed.If you're in the mood for a chop-fest,this might interest you.If you're looking for some backgroundsmoochie music - pass on this one.A players DVD."
3,eeeek!,"I loved the music in this concert. Chick is a master and always delivers with a top notch program. No complaints there...But... all I can figure is that some people got defective copies of this dvd, people like me for instants. I couldn't finish watching the show. The sinc was off just enough to drive me and everyone I pointed it out to, absolutely nuts!So, if you are one of those with a good copy, cool! Enjoy! If not, enjoy the music. Just turn off the picture..."
5,Chick Corea revisited,"Superb. It's nice to see the Elektrik Band with all the original musicians together, after a long time, and I have to say that time blended them wonderfully. The sound is just OK, but the camera really doesn't show exactly what I'd desire to see. Although there were some negative comments about sound image synchronization I have to say the it's just perfect. Chick keeps piloting the Rhodes and the piano like few in the world would do (that traditional audience participation was really boring, although), Gambale keeps his amazing guitar playing technis, allied with great charisma (if you haven't seen him for a long time, be prepared for a chock), Patitutti and Weckel do shine on stage but Rosenthal passed far from the ""G"" point, I don't know exactly why. Although I had'nt listened to most compositions I loved them all. In a word, worth every penny you spend."
4,Good,"It's a very good concert, but I wish it was a better work with the cameras, you lose very good details on the performances because of the bad shoots"
3,some great moments . . . but,"I really really wanted to like this one. Always been a fan, but this dvd has finally made me realize what I don't like. The sound is horrible - nothing but sax and keys most of the time (sorry, but Marienthal is closer to smooth jazz than I care to be). If you strain to listen, you can make out some snare drum and cymbal crashes that let you know Weckl's probably doing something amazing. Terrible camera work.Don't get me wrong, there are some stellar moments. Patittuci is great, every once in a while Gambale gets to shine, and Chick gets some cool spots. The whole effort, as one reviewer pointed out, doesn't really ooze FEEL. As great as the players are, I'm not getting much passion. Somebody please tell Chick not to do anymore ""audience participation"" cheeseball antics (it went on forever). I bought the Gonzalo Rubalcaba Trio on the same order - it has all the ingredients this one lacks!"
5,Excitement Under the Sea,"This was the neatest Finding Nemo book! It has all you need to know about the little secret things about Finding Nemo! In fact, it's my favorite book! Finding Nemo is my favorite movie, and now I have a favorite book to match it! I especially like how even the moonfish and jellyfish get their own page full of information. The tank gang's bios were very interesting, as were overlooking of the dentist's office. Thank you Nemo!"
5,. . .,"I bought this book expecting one of those 'Making of . . .' creations, but ended up being pretty disappointed. Don't get me wrong, this guide is very informative, amusing and candy for the eyes . . . but for children. Or, for adults with inner children. Seeing as I'm a cynical teenager, it didn't do much for me :)"
3,Early CGI still quiet entertaining,"Before you watch the main feature, check out the extra that discusses the early history of CGI animated films; (warning - the audio may be out of sync); because you'll probably enjoy the main feature more if you do. Definitely worth watching if you're interested in the development of CGI."
4,Could be better... But could be worse too..,"Okay so lets face it, the CGI of this movie looks almost identical to Playstation 1's cinematic scenes.. infact at times it almost feels as if you're playing a PS game and you feel the need to pick up the controller! Aside from that, this is a decent anime. The story is nothing special but its carried out well. The CGI is dated seeing how this is 5 years old now but it's still worth checking out if you're a fan of the methods. A.Li.Ce shouldnt dissapoint."
4,Definitely worth a listen,"I first heard of UVR sometime around 1999 when they were playing a show with my then-boyfriend's band. I'm not so into pop-punk - I usually went to the shows to support my boyfriend - but I liked UVR and bought their CD, The New Superpimp.I've been keeping up with the band over the years and reviewed this album in my high-school paper when it came out in 2002. I bought Blood on the Satellite when it came out in 2004, too.I think Plastic Girl is UVR's best album. It's pretty consistent; if you like one song, you'll probably like them all. ""She's That Kind of Girl,"" which appears on Superpimp, is my favorite UVR song to date. ""My Car"" and ""Perfect Eternity"" are other favorites.This album is a must-have for pop-punk fans."
5,these guys are awsome!,you've gotta love this pop/rock album...it gives you so much energy and just puts you in a good mood. Clean lyrics that you can relate to and great music...makes me proud to be from Tracy! i love you guys!!!
5,"Five Amazing Guys, One Amazing CD","If you like anything that it punk rock/pop rockish, you will love these guys! I met them my freshman year of high school which means that I have been following them for almost four and a half years now, and they only get better and better. They are going to be featured in a new MTV movie and need as much exposure as they can get...I love UVR!Cat"
5,Who needs batteries?,"I grew up with one of these, except in 70s orange of course!The counter adds up your savings in 5 intervals (pennies don't get counted), so you can see the value of each coin with some basic math skills. Unless they have changed it, you can also put other coins or bills in the back through a slot although they don't add up on the counter. It does lock from I believe 25 until you put $10 worth of coins through the mechanism. No, it doesn't tell you the name of each coin or how much more you have to save, but I loved just putting the coins in and cranking the lever, and the impatient waiting to get it open again.I had been looking at the new electronic models for my boys, but I think I'll just hand over my old Uncle Sam until I come across one that's not baby pink! The newer versions are improved as mine had only a bit of rubber over the end of the lever which of course is long gone. I know the bank itself will last another 30+ years!"
2,MM's,"I had hoped for a layman's explanation of keys, chords and the like, but this book is too ""music lite""."
1,a fine mess indeed,"Yes this band is awful. I have heard their ablum attempts and it's just plain painful to listen too. There is a complete lack of originality regardless of what they say. They even write their own reviews. It's hilarious. They tried to bash me on my Blog with comments like ""he has gaye eyes"" and something about f*cking my mother in the basement. It was pretty lame they have even go so far as the threaten to ""f*ck me up"". All the while, writing in some crazy ebonics and butchering the spelling at the same time. I seriously think they all might me 12 and live w/ their parents, but I could be wrong. Anyhow I give this album one star for lack of orginality, talent, the ablitlty to spell, and ruining a chance to play decent music.You guys are awesome."
1,like a night of soaking your feet in cold water,"The concept of this product is great. But if you're a size 6 and the booty comes in one size 7-9, it's a loose fit. There are air pockets and the silicone gets cold. I tried to accommodate this by fitting tube socks over the booties. But I was still miserable.I did however, wake up with soft skin on my feet. I kept the booties, hoping I would be able to suffer through the experience again. They are not worth it to me and I would not recommend them over a good soaking of cream and white cotton socks."
3,Cheesy fit,"I was SO excited to get these. They showed up and the quality appeared good. Went out to the car, had to wrestle them on, and was not impressed from there on out. The top does not fit snug to my seats and has velcro that wants to stick more to the saddle material than to the other velcro. The head rest covers are loose and borderline worthless. The S hooks that came with it, only half of them had an opening wide enough that was ready to use. The other S hooks, I had to open myself with pliers. Pretty bummed that they fit this poorly for the price. If I wanted something of this level of fit I would rather save $50 and pick up a pair at a local store, ie. Fred Meyer. I have yet to show my husband, but if I were a betting lady, I'd place my money on these getting returned."
4,One of my favorite volumes in the series,"The story of Ashura and Yasha always fascinated me and in this setting especially. The fights were beautifully drawn, as usually, and the cliffhanger ending would have made me want to scream and yell if I hadn't had the next volume in the series at hand already."
1,The Power of God Cannot Be Denied!,"I personally cannot beleive how someone would want to write about a man in ministry in the first place, after all this ministry has blessed millions of people around the world. I myself have experienced it in such mighty ways through Benny Hinn Ministries. I myself have been prayed for when I attended a conference, and no matter what they say, it's as real as you and me, even more so. Don't buy the deceit, it can be a snare to you. Amen!"
1,BENNY HINN EXPOSED AS THE CROOK HE IS,"A GREAT BOOK REVEALING THE FALSE TEACHINGS AND OUTRIGHT DECEPTION OF BENNY HINN. I KNOW THAT MANY OF BENNY HINN FANS WONT LIKE THIS BOOK, BUT BENNY HINN FANS SEEM TO BE FOLLOWING A DIFFERENT SPIRIT OTHER THAN THE HOLY SPIRIT...I SEE AND HEAR MANY BENNY HINN FOLLOWERS TALK ABOUT ""FEELING"" AND FEELINGS AND FOCUSING ON THEMSELVES AND IN THIS EVIL ""ITS ALL ABOUT ME AND MY FEELINGS"" GENERATION BENNY HINN WILL CONTINUE TO GROW. HOWEVER, TRUE CHRISTIANS KNOW THAT A RELATIONSHIP WITH CHRIST HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH FEELINGS, ITS NOT ABOUT US BUT ABOUT ""HIM""...THIS BOOK INFORMS BELIVERS WHAT THEY ALREADY KNOW, BENNY IS A HOAX..IMAGINE JESUS, WHO SLEPT ON THE GROUND, HAD TO BORROW A DONKEY TO RIDE IN ON AND NEVER OWNED A THING, AND COMPARE HIM WITH BENNY HINNS WHITE $500.00 SUITS AND LIMOS AND AIRPLANES..WHAT WOULD JESUS DO....PUKE ON BENNY HINN !!"
1,Benny Hinn is not a Healer nor has he ever said he was.,"God is the Healer....and Benny Hinn is the first to say this. Benny Hinn is not the Healer. God has called this man to take his Word to the Nations.....and win souls for God. God choses to Heal many who come to Benny Hinn's Crusades.......God is the same today as He was yesterday and will be tomorrow. Yes, God still heals today. And He uses many humans who are willing to let Him use them to reach souls. God does not want anyone to be lost forever in satan's grip. God Bless all of You and see that God is the Healer here.....not Benny Hinn. Benny Hinn is only a human being who is willing to be used by God for whatever God wants him to do for Him. Thank God there are willing humans like Benny Hinn, who become targets of ridicule and hatred by those of the world who do not understand God's word, just because they say YES to God."
1,Touch Not Mine Anointed,This book is wriiten without an understanding about the things of the Spirit. Nobody comes to Christ unless the Holy Spirit draws them. Pastor Benny Hinn has lead millions to Christ through his powerful ministry. We are not called to judge a ministry or point fingers and say whether it's of God or not. If you want a book that explains the true ministry of Pastor Benny Hinn I recommend a book called A Servant's Heart: Finding Your Spiritual Father. Author: Jason PowersThe confusion world of Benny Hinn is not a discernment of a ministry. It's a hatred towards a man thats blessed of God. A man that touches many lives.
1,Buy this book now if u want a paper weight,"What can I say...I alway wonder what the author of this book is doing now dont you? Take my word for what its worth this book is not worth the paper it is printed on. Benny Hinn is a Godly man we all know this. So if you consider yourself to be a christian, dont buy this book since it will benifit you in now way whatsoever. I wonder if the author himself has made mistakes before?...and another important fact is the majority of this book is false and many incidents are misinterpreted nad clearly someone needs a revelation ^_^ ...SO I HIGHLY RECCOMMEND THIS BOOK TO PEOPLE WHO WANT TO FIND ABOUT THE AUTHOR MR FISHER SINCE IT PROVIDED A GREAT INSIDE INTO THIS MANS LIFE...I now officially rename the book THE CONFUSING WORLD OF G. FISHER ^__________^ so if u want to know about him buy the book now...dont hesitate its a must read for MR fisher fans!"
3,What You Get...,"The four titles are ... Rendezvous With Ragnarok, Dawn Of The Day Of The Night Of The Penguin, It's Sleazy, and Tour Of Scum. I haven't seen these so I don't know what the quality is like. I just thought somebody ought to list the titles since Amazon - and most other DVD retailers - don't even tell you what's on the collection!"
3,"""Room For Improvement""","Not as good as I was led to believe it would be by all the rave editoral reviews, but still worth a listen. Room for improvement."
3,Not Quite Right!,"One can tell Emerson left the band with this recording. It has a nice initial appeal, but it doesn't last in the long run. One of the things that is different is the ""lead singer"" vocalizes more on this record than any of their others. I wish he didn't. It would be a better record then!If you like similar beats and grooves they have done, then you'll like the recording. If your looking for something fresh from them, this is not for you. If you don't care, go for it! It is worth a spin anyway!"
4,Over the world,"When Underworld put out the climatic live CD Everything Everything in 2000, it kinda signalled the end of the group with the departure of eminent DJ Darren Emerson, but fret not. The remaining duo in the group managed to come out on their own an efferverscent piece.Beginning with the epic 10-minute long Two Months Off, Underworld tries to regain some familiar ground with this energised number which incidentally features a stunning video! The rest of the album takes on a more relaxed and less frentic approach with some songs inducing an atmosphere of laid back lounge music.Recommended tracks include the opener Mo Move, Two Months Off, Twist, SolaSistem, Trim and the closer Luetin."
4,Not Bad!,"Underworld may have called their latest CD ""A Hundred Days Off,"" but the title should in no way imply that these guys are slackers. On this CD, we're taken into a world of futuristic dance pop featuring energetic dance beats and mid-tempo nuggets. It's hard to resist the 9-minute hypnotic excursion of ""Two Days Off,"" which is set to a hyperactive beat. ""Dinosaur Adventure 3D"" is also a fast-paced groove that palpitates with enough energy to conjure up images of an all-night Saturday rave. But Underworld are equally effective when they shift gears, bring down the tempo, and morph into chillout mode. ""Trim"" is a laid back number with some cool guitars, while ""SolaSistim"" stands out pretty well, too. I've heard better dance records this year, but ""Underworld"" is good enough to command your attention."
3,Yeah it does have to grow on you.,"But I could get use to just about any sound after a while--so, I guess I am not as impressed with this album as much as others by Underworld or others by other artist. I am an Underworld fan--but not--I mean I am fan of great music--and this particular album is not great--its not bad either."
3,mediocre,"What's really unfortunate is when an artist puts out an album so brilliant early in their career that they spend all subsequent releases trying to live up to past glories (just ask Tricky). ""Dubnobasswithmyheadman"" this is not. Is it because of Darren Emmerson's departure? Who knows. This certainly isn't horrible, but I burnt out on it rather quickly. I can really only sum up my opinion of this with one word: ""eh."""
2,not great,"really went off this one pretty quickly. i dont care who is still in the band and who isnt,its just a bad album. dont understand the rave reviews cos this is pretty mediocre stuff and i know they can do a lot better. hoping they will next time! i can forgive them one bad album.i know a lot of underworld fans and no one is into this, even after their fantastic gig here in new york in october.this is going out on the street for a homeless person to pick up and make a buck or two off."
5,My Favorite Underworld.,This one is quickly becoming my favorite Underworld CD. You have to give it some time and let the tracks build. I cannot think of one track on the CD I dislike. Give it a listen or two. Its awsome.
2,100 days off was not enough,"First of all this is far from techno, however i do like some Underworld songs. The song ""Born Slippy"" made for trainspotting in 1996 was exelent and one of the best dance single's of that year, but after that they haven't really been making so much good music i expected. None of the songs on this album is any remarkable. I won't say it's that bad, but they are simply too slow and simular too each other. No hit music, no music to dance to, no music that you can do anyhing else then just relax too. I feel that they don't bring anything new to the genre with this Cd. I will accept this the more i listen to it ofcourse but it's far from what we expect them to do."
2,empty,"this is the least creative ever of all underworld releases.they are obviously trying to repeat things which have worked well in the past without any real feeling behind the music.emmerson must have been providing the real depth to this band in the past, it sure isnt there now.ive been a fan for many years and feel it important to say this is heading in a bad direction - an attempt to be catchy and popular, losing what made them so special before.most of it sounds excruciatingly obvious, and so banal i want to cringe.goodbye underworld, i will miss you!"
1,Lazy and Unoriginal,"warning: this album is utterly disappointing. underworld has gotten lazy, as all their songs sound like they only took about 5 minutes to write and record. you can make better stuff than this with your own keyboard while watching ""the sopranos"". their best albums remain ""dubnobass..."" and ""second toughest in the infants"", which both are original, versatile, and above all, bumpin'. there are a few great underworld songs on the ""trainspotting"" soundtracks which are not on any of the albums."
2,Slow moving and dry,"When I first read about this book, I was extremly exciited. It combined historical fiction with, what I thought would be a compelling mystery. Neither of the these components turned out to be interesting or enlightening in any way. The story started out slowly, and dully, and remained that way through most of the book. I forced myself to finish it, thinking the ending would compensate for its lack of entertaining material in the rest of it. It hardly did. For those of you who are looking for an intriguing novel that will provide new details about ancient Britian, or time travel, I would suggest you find another book."
3,Not great,"This book wasn't as interesting as I had hoped, but its not bad. I just didn't feel a connection with the characters or the setting. The plot seemed very contrived."
5,"If you like mysteries and gardening, you'll love this book!","I found ""Roots of Murder"" to be a very enjoyable read, with lots of interesting characters from formerly over-weight florists to Amish farmers. The story keeps moving along, with no long dry spells like some mysteries. This book reminded me of Sue Grafton's Kinsey Milhone series.I am looking forward to Bretta's next adventure."
3,Who is Saul,"Being a JFK buff, I try to read just about any book on the assassination. Mr. McDonald seems to have the credentials that would make you ask yourself, what reason does this man have that would make him lie? There isnt one because I feel he isn't lying. This is a new twist on the whole conspiracy. No one in the grassy knoll???? The mystery man Saul who actually pulled the trigger and the whole plan to kill Oswald at the scene, had me reading through the night. Do you want to tell my boss why I was half asleep at work the next day, I don't. This is a good read for any JFK conspiracy buff, it made me look at the whole event in a different light."
4,Great ring & Great Service,The rings were just as advertised and delivered quickly.We love them.It does takes a few days to 'break them in' so they spin easily.
5,Tudor Rose,"Wonderful book. I would like to read books, just like this one. History of British is always enjoyable to read.Fereshteh B."
4,Very interesting!,"It was very informative yet It showed the emotions of the heroine. The storyline corroborated all the other historical accounts I have read, with the exception of the name of Henry VII's older brother...but, perhaps I've had it wrong all along!"
5,Good Read,The begining of the Tudor dynasty from the perspective of Elizabeth of York. Interesting characters and interesting interactions between them. Well written.
3,Its okay,"This one was a little bit hard for me to follow. I liked the book, but it seemed boring at times."
4,What happened to the 2 little Princes in the Tower?,"I read this book about Henry VIII's parents because I had gotten so involved in the BBC series. It was done very skillfully so that the historical characters are believable. The author makes Elizabeth, as a princess and as a queen, come alive as a woman with a lot on her shoulders along with emotions that anyone can identify with. The mystery of what happened to her 2 brothers is never answered but it is just one of the many tragedies that this woman overcame in order to create one of England's brilliant dynasties.Amazon.com Gift Cards - In a Gift Box - Free One-Day Shipping"
3,Bringing History to Life,"I read this book on the heels of finishing Philippa Gregory's book The White Queen, about Elizabeth Woodville, mother to the central character in this book, Elizabeth of York. At first I was comparing it to Gregory's book. That was a mistake. This author has a very different style so it's impossible to compare the two. It took a while for me to get into this book. Once I did I found it to be an interesting portrait of a queen. She portrayed Elizabeth of York in a very human light. She came across as multi-dimensional, likable, and sympathetic. It explored some interesting topics like how Elizabeth might have reacted to the ""pretender"" who claimed to be her long lost brother Richard, Duke of York. I would've given the book a higher rating if it hadn't dragged at the beginning and If the depiction of Henry VII hadn't been so one-dimensional.Jennifer K. LaffertyAuthor of Offbeat Love Stories and More"
5,Well written and interesting,"I found this novel very interesting. It kept my attention the entire time, and shed an interesting point of view on these important historical characters. I would highly reccomend it."
2,boring zzzz.........,"The problem is not with the author; it is with the subject. It seems that life happens around Elizabeth but she is not really part of it. She was overshadowed by her mother, her mother-in-law, her husband, and if she had lived longer, she would have been overshadowed by her son. Nice book to go to sleep to!"
1,Dull,"It's not often that I come across a book that I don't finish, but this one was a rare exception. I thought the idea to look at history through Elizabeth's eyes was good, but it was not carried off well at all. I have read other books in this genre that were much more interesting to read, and I would advise other readers to save their $ and perhaps look at buying a different book."
5,Classic Twista,"Mobstability by Twista and the Speedknot Mobstaz is a classic album. It starts off hard with Crook County which is no doubt a diss to the Bone Thugs. Every song on the album is hot. Whether its fast bouncy tracks like ""Rock Y'all Spot"" or more laid back songs like ""Loyalty"", this CD is fantastic all the way through. Twista is an underground phenomenon who is bound to blow up soon and this CD is just a taste of what is to come."
3,"Dope production, same old tired genre.","Here we have a situation where the dope production can somewhat make up for the lyrical content. The beats are straight up head knockin', but the gangsta sh*t is tired and played out. Twista & The Speedknot Mobstaz are coming out like straight g's, the production is tight, but if every song wasn't some ignorant expression of the struggle of the street game, this album would be dope. Since it's not, well, sh*t happens. On a whole though, songs like ""Crook County"", and the N.W.A. ""Alwayz Into Somethin'"" stolen track for ""Mobstability"", are almost dope, except their method of articulation is offensive to any intelligent hiphop fan, maybe these guys are straight up real gangsta's, but my theory is that real gangsta's don't make records. Basically, this album ain't that bad, but this is the same old tired gangsta sh*t that defined hiphop in the late 80's, not the late 90's."
5,TWISTA SPEEDKNOT MOBSTAZ,JUST LIKE I REMEMBERED AWESOME LOVE IT CAN'T WAIT TO LISTEN TO THE WHOLE ALBEM AGAIN IT'S BEEN SO LONG BRING ME BACK THE MEMORIES!
3,Disappointment,"Man! After Adrenaline Rush, I was all set to go. Ready to pick up the next album that Twista had something to do with. Oh well. This one just didn't measure up. That's part of the problem with dropping such a tight album as Adrenaline Rush. It's tough to match prior successes (although Outkast seems to do it over and over and over.) I guess I'll try to wait and check out ""Kamakazee"" in '99."
4,Mostaz Elite,"Following Adrenaline Rush, Twista teamed up with the duo, Speedknot Mobstaz, for a Chi-Town massacre. 14 tracks where the Mobstaz laced all The Legendary Traxster's beats. The title track is composed similar to N.W.A.'s ""Alwayz Into Something"" and is as nice as the original. As the trio calls out competition to ""Mob Up"" you get to journey with the ""Legit Ballers"" through Chicago. ""Warm Embrace"" is a song about loving and feeling guns. ""Front Porch"" features the vocals of Danny Boy to take the album to another level. Though most of the songs are slow to mid-tempo to compliment Twista's flow sometime the others don't stand up to his caliber. As they show another side on the commercial, r&b feel ""Dreams"", they equally shared the spotlight. ""Crook County (Bone Crusher Mix) featuring Newsense is the fastest song that sets the tone for the rest to come on this lp. This is a must have for the production and lyrics both are impressive."
1,There's better science fiction out there,"From other reviews I had read, I had high hopes for ""Delta Search."" This book didn't meet those expectations at all. The story is contrived and overused, the characters are unrealistic and unattractive, and the ending was inane. This is what one gets when reading the pop culture junk that pervades our society. Please don't waste your time on this book like I did. There are plenty of other great books out there to be found. Now if you are looking for a good novel along a similar line with realistic characters and an engaging story line, I would recommend ""Ender's Game"" by Orson Scott Card instead."
5,Best Transition Book Ever,"This book is a great transition book from QuarkXPress to InDesign! They are two completely different systems to switch from butd the book makes it easy to do. I recommend this to everyone. And even better, buy a used book, you'll see someone else's highlights which helps find the important stuff."
3,needs an update for current technology,"The main reason I got this book was to help me size a furnace for the house and calculate the size of the duct system. I only partially got what I needed. The examples for duct sizing started well, but fizzled out as it did not show how to include the effects elbows and other attachments in the calculation and is also missing other pertinent information. Interestingly enough, the discussion of Duct Sizing started in Volume 1 which I got from the library, but the juicy stuff was postponed to Volume 2 which I purchased, and perhaps the end of that discussion appears in Volume 3, which I am not going to purchase. This seems to be a business driven decision which I found quite distasteful. A well written book should self containing as much as it can be helped. Also lacking is a good discussion on more modern two stage furnaces and thermostats. Pages dedicated to Mercury thermostats are a bit outdated, maybe by 50 years. For a free duct calculation site try: [...]"
2,Mae West Was Wrong,"Mae West supposedly said that too much of a good thing is not enough.Well, we bought a case of packages of Bugles via Amazon's ""repeat"" shopper plan (which I like).Probably I should have bought 1 or 2 bags at Wal-Mart and not tried to save money. A few of these snacks are OK, but they gradually lose their appeal if you are a committed snacker. The taste is a little strong, or sour, or dry, or something not memorable (like Mae West).We bought the case last fall and still have 1 or 2 bags....."
4,"tastes great, but I'm a little concerned about the saturated fat content","Bugles are a great snack that have been around a long time. I can remember eating them as a kid as far back as the 1970s, and I still occasionally eat them today. They have a distinctive corny taste which, as far as I know, is unlike anything else currently on the market. On the basis of taste alone, this product would rate 5 stars, however, I am only giving 4 stars out of 5 because of the high staurated fat content, something that is easily evident from a glance at the nutrition label. Bugles have much higher saturated fat content than many other snacks - a result, I suppose, of coconut oil (rather than vegetable or corn oil) being a main ingredient. I wonder, why can't they make Bugles lower in saturated fat and overall fat content, and would it really taste any different?"
5,YUMMY!,I hadn't seen these in years. Bought a bag at the grocery store and got addicted to them all over again. Went back to get more and they were out of stock - for 3 weeks. I am so happy to find them on Amazon.
1,"Does NOT Work, made me WORSE!","Ok, I'm all for natural treatments. But, this is product does not work. In fact, I am more stuffed now from using it only for 2 days. I will now have to go to the doctor to get medicine whereas before I was just having light stuffiness mainly in the morning. I can barely breathe out of my nose now. I'll be returning this!"
4,SEAGATE OLIVE LEAF NASAL SPRAY,"Definately works better than saline. I have also tried silver nasal sprays with no luck. I have a problem with thick mucus and swollen nasal passage that prevents drainage. This spray rapidly starts breaking up the the thick mucus and promotes drainage within a few minutes, and helps to decrease the problem. It aslo has anti bacterial, anti fungal properties- thats a plus, since so many sinus problems are caused by fungus. I will buy it again. Would recommend."
1,I'm Disappointed,"After reading glowing reviews here I thought I'd give this natural sinus spray a try. It did not help clear the congestion in my sinuses at all. In fact, I think it made the soft tissues more inflamed which causes more swelling and thus, more blockage. I have had the same result when trying a plain saline spray like ""Ocean"". I won't be using the rest of my bottle."
1,Rude Customer Service,"I purchased this product to help my with allergies. After using it I had a severe allergic reaction to the nasal spray and was seen by my physician. Soon after I completed allergy testing and found out I'm allergic to olive trees. At the time I purchased the nasal spray I was unaware of my allergic reaction to olive trees.So I wrote Seagate Customer Service and you can read their response below:If you are are already using it and are not allergic to it, then why would you stop using it? Of course the real question should have been -- why did you buy a product called Olive Leaf Nasal Spray when you know that you are allergic to olive trees? Most likely at this point if you do not have any allergic reaction after a few days of use, then the product will be fine for you.Thank youSeagate Customer ServiceOn Wed, Aug 22, 2012 at 5:03 PM"
4,"Helpful, but Not Magic","My boyfriend and I have both been using this product for almost a month now, and we're quite impressed with it. We both suffer from chronic sinusitis and we find that this product does help some on our better days. However, if it's a really bad sinus day, it's going to be bad no matter what. It is definitely better than a lot of the prescription nasal sprays I have used. It doesn't burn at all and doesn't leave any unpleasant taste in your throat either. Since we were not expecting much of this product to begin with, I guess we are quite pleasantly surprised and will definitely buy it again but it is not really a magic potion that does away with all our problems, but it does reduce some of the discomforts associated with it."
5,This stuff is awesome!,I've been using this stuff for several years now and recommend it to everyone! It's great for any kind of nose issue like allergies and sinus infections. I had a sinus infection that was going on two weeks and it cleared it up in one afternoon!!
2,little help,MAybe helped me just a little with chronic sinus problem but not much and very drying to the nose.
3,French Ballads,I like this CD well enough. I would like to hear Aznavour sing some other selections.
2,Does Not Work,I followed directions exactly. Product did NOT work. I now have more white spots than before. I would not recommend this product. Save your money.
1,Not sure yet-product has expired dates.,"I have only been using this product for 3 days but I just noticed that the 2 bottles of Halt that I bought through Amazon have expired dates. Dates expired 5 months ago, and I am not sure if this product is still any good. Does anyone know, and what can I do about this? I am still going to continue using this product and hopefully it will work."
1,Didn't work for me,This product didn't help my spots at all. I am going to dermatologist to get problem resolved. I would suggest you see a pro and save the money.
5,Worked for me,"First off go to your dermatologist and get econazole nitrate or look for antifungals at drug stores with -azoles in them to kill tinea. This product restores color well for me and quick too but i have to be in the sun or go to a tanning bed if there is no sun. I get tinea v. about every winter and have used this several times. Doc said 1-2 months for color to come back with RX product, halt brings it back in 1-2 weeks."
1,halt lotion for sun spots,this did not help me at all. still have all my sun spots. just a waste of my money.
4,"Works, really.","After battling sunspots the last three years, I can finally say I've found a cure. I have very tan skin and the tinea shows up as white blotches all over my inner elbows and forearms, where I sometimes get eczema in the winter (although not bad). I used Halt last year, and it worked OK, but I ordered again this year and can honestly say it DOES WORK, and fast, when you do it in the right way.The directions included are not very clear. Here's my way:Shower as it says, make sure you scrub the affected area with a loofah or something to get the dead skin off. Apply Halt and let dry on skin (I lather it on pretty thick). Do this for a few days BEFORE You start tanning. This is how long it takes for the stuff to go away. After 3 or 4 applications, start going into the sun RIGHT AFTER you apply Halt. It doesn't say on the bottle, but I think this is how it works. A week or so later of applying once or twice a day and you'll be good."
2,Didn't work for me at all,"Spots still there. Used it faithfully for over a month with no changes at all.Glad it works for some, I am still searching for something that will work for me."
5,orbital sander,"Great sander, couldn't find one better at any price. Looked long and hard, and have tried a few others. This is one of the best. Already finish sanding and buffing 2 cars."
1,Not for general use,"Oh how I wish I hadn't spilled soda on my 32sii... I purchased the HP50 as an upgrade/ replacement for the 32. I've owned several HP RPN calculators over the decades but I can't get over how awkward this unit is to use. The manual is terrible at explaining the functions, it seems to be random on when they explain step by step versus vague descriptions of the features. I still haven't figured out how to do a conversion between liters and gallons rather than having to remember 3.79.This thing will be a brick for all but the most devoted users.I now know why people are willing to pay several hundred dollars for a used 32sii."
5,The new generation of HP does not disappoint,"Love my new HP 50g! My old 48 sx finally bit the dust, and I was concerned I'd never be able to find anything comparable during the waning days of calculators. The 50g does not disappoint. While there is some adjustment in becoming familiarized with the key location and operation, it nevertheless does capture the quality construction, crisp key operation and versatility of its predecessor. In fact I think I prefer it to the 48 sx. Highly recommended for any science/engineering type who has experience with and loves HP products from the past."
4,It's not my 48gx,"So far I'm pretty happy with the 50g but I don't like it as much as my trusty 48gx that I used for almost a decade. One major PITA is doing unit conversions, no where as easy as with the 48. Don't get me wrong, it is a great product and I may get used to it in time."
4,A different calculator,"If you don't want a TI then these are great calculators. I never really used TIs and when I finally needed to buy a graphing calculator I got this one instead of a TI because I was told HPs are better for engineers and that this calculator was going to be more powerful as well. That may be true, but so far I haven't seen a huge difference between the two.It's a good calculator by any means and I'm happy with it, but I'd only really recommend it to people who don't like TIs or need the specific features of the HP because most people out there are going to have TIs and you are going to have to learn how to do everything on the HP on your own. This may pay off down the road, but unless you are absolutely a full time user of calculators, it's a bit of a pain."
5,Service received,"About the quality of the calculator, being HP nothing much to say. What I want to enphasize is that my original package didn't show up, because of courrier. I am very satisfied with Amazon response when they prompt sent a new order at NO COST to me.I really appreciated the gesture. Is the second time this happens and also as usual, Amazon respond for it.Thank you very, very much to all the people working at Amazon.com and I mean all of you guys.Irineu Scalisse"
4,all what I'll expect,"This product give me all what I need.Always it can be better, but at this moment is the best in order that relation price versus utilities."
5,This is a great calculator!,"I had many calculators & this is the best. The main problem is the documentation is not so good. But if u take the time to learn how to use it, u will be very happy with it. You have the option of RPN/Algebra, It has plenty of memory including an SD card slot, The Equation Writer makes inputting complex equations a breeze, it has a constants & equations library, It can use USB 5V power in addition to batteries, u can control the auto power off feauture by making a var called TOFF, Overall all the functions & feautures are integrated. I highly recommend this product & I bought it at Amazon.com!!!!!"
4,from 48G to 50g,"I love gadgets, and I like this calculator. I bought it after a while working, because the old time in college, I like that the manual is a pdf, thus I don't need something heavy with me. It will take me some time to check it, because is different to the other one, but at least faster and I love that I can plug to my computer. I didn't have so much time to play with it, but so far, I'm happy with it :DI would put all the stars maybe after checking all functions, because the manual is huge and look like I do everything, even Fourier and FFT 0_o"
2,Needs some improvements.,"HP clearly knows how to design calculators and the program is just fine on this calculator. However I have a problem with the way this thing is put together. It feels cheap and light weight, not suitable for a work environment or even years of college. My old 48GX was built like a tank. And even the first version of the 49G with all its problems felt more rugged than this 50G.One of my major issues is the battery compartment door is very flimsy and feels like it's going to fly off. This thing is made in China and it shows unfortunately. HP how much does it cost to beef up the case and make it more like the build quality of the stuff you guys were building back in the 90's. HP was the holy grail of calculators and with 2300 built in functions they have a great platform, they just need to make this baby feel like the vintage stuff and they'd give us a reason to stop buying the old stuff and start buying their new stuff."
5,"RPN, nothing like it",As versatile a calculator as you will ever find with the famous proven HP quality and at Amazon's price a steal.
5,HP50g,The most advanced and capable calculator I've ever used. The learning curve is a little steep but that is a reflection of the capabilities of this unit. HP has several tutorials online that are very helpful.
2,HP 50G,"Be prepared to be frustrated learning this calculator. The manual is awful. For example, the ""Contents of the Calculator display"" section (page 1-3)starts off with:""The first line shows the characters: RAD XYZ HEX R= 'X' ""And then instructs you to go to chapter two to find out the meaning. That is just a preview of how utterly poor this very brief manual really is."
2,Not good.,"Calculator would be fine, but it has very poor response on the keys. Very disappointing overall.I previously owned the HP 48G and this calculator doesn't measure up."
5,Good HP Calc,"OK, i buy this calc for a friend who is Civil Engineer, and he said me that it's the best gift he was received, and said me too that this calc is extraordinary."
5,Very good calculator,Works fantastically to graph and to do all the calculations specially for electrical problems.After you get used to it is the best product
4,Avaliation!,"Delivery as agreed, excellent buy! Recommend buying because the product is of high quality and is very easy to perform all procedures for purchase."
3,pregunta,"de antemano un cordial saludo les escribo para informarles que el producto (hp 50g) no ha llegado a la receptoria de liberty express en miami por lo cual presento preocupación, quisiera respuesta de dicho producto sin mas a que hacer referencia me despido gracias."
5,Great product. axactely what I was looking for!,"The hp 50g is a great tool for engineering studants and those who use to develop any kind of calculos, like math, fisic, chemistry and anything else.The shop delivery date was ok and the product was is pretty good fisic conditios"
5,Good Calculator,I'm an engineering major and I needed a replacement for my TI-89 Titanium. The display is not as nice and you have to push an extra button to see the equation. I haven't found out how to edit the equation on screen. I just copy and paste. I really like the external memory slot. It took a while to get my 1 and 2 gig SDcards to work. You can get a lot of online help from other users.
4,Helped me pass my college math requirements.,"I have both a TI and bought this as an alternative to the Highest TI calculator. This thing does everything, just punch in the equation and it works a problem for you or graphs it for you, if only I could figure out how to use it. It did help me get good test scores though."
4,A bit dated,"The quality you expect from HP is present, but the operating software needs updating, To use flashcards with a 16 bit structure is a bit much with what is available today! And what about a color screen?I do love the ability to switch between algebraic and RPN though."
3,Horrible industrial design,"I love HP calculators and RPN... but this packaging is almost impossible to get into. I couldn't open the plastic packaging with scissors or sharp knife. I had to attack it with a Chinese cleaver and a hearty swing, then much difficult tearing. And inserting the back-up battery was another exercise in frustration, requiring a screwdriver to lever this battery cover open, destroying the ""fail safe"" latch in the process. Don't purchase this unless you have very strong hands and an industrial strength opener (perhaps tin snips)."
5,Good Calculator!!!,"Muy buena calculadora, la necesito mucho en la universidad y es lo que esperaba, excelente calculadora, la recomiendo"
2,not really great,The display is not easily read. The background and figures are not sufficiently contrasted in the calculator.There was no documentation save a quick start brochure. For a scientific instrument this is not desirable.I was able contact HP and download proper documentation. It is available gratis.I will not buy this king of equipment from a second source again. I'll wait and save for the new instrument.
1,HP 50G Graphing Calculator is a Junk,"HP 50G is the worst electronic product I have ever bought in my life. This calculator freezes frequently and you cannot turn it off unless you reset it. The software for connectivity does not function for what reasons, only HP engineers know. The user manual is absolute disgrace to HP company. You cannot read to understand what they want you to do. The manual and the calculator are too complex to use. I will never, never recommend HP 50G to any student. I cannot use or turn off my calculator since yesterday. Until the technical heads at HP wake up and make the usage of this gadget comprehensive, this Calculator will remain a junk on the market. Please, fellow students do not worst your money on this technically defective product."
3,HP50G Scientific Calculator,"Not nearly as good as the older HP48GX which just gave up the ghost for me. And the keys are not arranged the same way making it slow and confusing until I memorize the arrangment. It is difficult to enter numbers since the keys stick a bit and I continually have to redo calculations. Sorry HP, you just didn't produce this time. I am disappointed! Although, HP does make the best calculators out there so I can't give it a totally negative review. If you can find and afford a 48GX, by all means do so. And I'm speaking from some experience having been one of the first in line to buy a TI10 way back in the day. And working up the line and switching to RPN logic sometime back in the late 70's. I've been an HP advocate ever since."
4,SECOND ONE GOOD,I purchased the HP 50g about three months ago. Mine must have been early production because it had a serial number starting with zero(0). Something was malfunctioning because batteries lasted only 4-6 days. Contacted HP and was told to remove batteries for 24 hours then install fresh batteries. Did not make any difference. HP sent me another calculator and let me keep the old one. Old one works if I keep it plugged into a USB power supply. Too bad HP is letting their scientific calculators diminish in importance in their product line. They once made outstanding quality scientific calculators no other company could match. Would like to see them bring back a compact scientific calculator like the HP 15c.
5,Excellent Product,"Bought for use in a Physics A-Level. Has many features I will probably never use but at this price it was a bargain. An excellent calculator with a quality look and feel to it.The only thing I would mention on the negative side is the key issue, whereby if you press say '5' twice in quick succession the device will only recognize one '5'. A good idea to prevent repeat keystrokes however annoying and doesn't have a way to turn it off!Other than that, well worth the money, loaded with features, and a quality leather case to boot.Highly recommended."
2,Lag in pressing buttons,I became very frustrated pressing buttons in quick sequence and it not keeping up with my entries. I have to repress buttons to get them entered. I have never seen this before in a calculator. I ended up giving to my son for school. Maybe he'll have better luck. Try the 48g. It's my favorite of all time. First one lasted 20 years. I just lost it though.
3,HP 50G Graphing Calculator,"In my opinion, the HP 50G seems to be a very capable calculator, but the operator's manual and the 887 pages PDF manual is terrible! IF HP could figure out how to write a detailed manual that actually explained how to use the model 50G calculator they would have an unbeatable product."
4,Good but difficult to use.,Definetly the best calculator i've ever had. Very complete.But it's still very hard to use. I hope I get better on this.
1,WTF,"OMG! I just couldn't imagine it when i heard there was going to be a korn unplugged. This junk is horrible! Korn is one the worlds greatest bands, but still, unplugged, i can't listen to one word, it sucks so much!"
4,Remembering Tesla,"I haven't heard this album yet, and I never write reviews of the music I listen but this time I was very mad when I read that this Unplugged collections started with Nirvana, how can someone be so ignorant and blind, first of all, the first album with this kind of recordings was Tesla's Five Men Acoustical Jam back in 1990 and because of it's fame MTV started the unplugged TM thing, and their first cd out was Mariah Carey's. Nirvana did it 4 years later, I don't understand the rush of saying that Nirvana started this and they changed that, after all they were only an average band with one MTV made super hit."
1,wutever korn,"oooo, nu-metal with a spanish flair!!! ughh... kill me. this cd is so bad. and yes i can bash it along with all the other bashers otherwise there would only be good comments and people like me will buy it and be all disapointed. DONT DO IT! korn has been irrelavent ever since issues in my opinion. :) and listening to john with his annoying whinny voice and pathetic excuse for poetic lyrics is torture"
1,Comedians,"My stomach still hurts from laughing. Never knew those guys from Korn were such comedians! I've always liked them throughout the years: because of the heavy bass, the grooving guitars, the maniacal vocals and the simplicity of the songs. Four good reasons never to do an unplugged album. Pretentious little piano dingdongs, a capella voices, Bonanza-style rhythms... this album is so funny it's actually painful."
2,"No. Stop it. No. Bad Korn, bad.","If only this were just a poorly timed, awkwardly misplaced joke. Then we could at least get a good laugh out of it. Unfortunately, it seems that they're quite serious.Here's a list of the songs on the album that really suck:1. Blind2. Hollow Life3. Freak On A Leash feat. Amy Lee from Evanescence4. Falling Away From Me5. Creep6. Love Song7. Got The Life8. Twisted Transistor9. Coming Undone10. Make Me Bad / In Between Days feat. The Cure11. Throw Me AwayAnd here's list of the songs on the album that are awesome:..........................................................So, if you insist on listening to this, a well placed bullet in the brain would be advised prior to consumption."
4,Best that they could do,"This album was obviously outside of the group's comfort zone, but the album is quite good for something as foreign to Korn as acoustic performances."
5,Great Music,"I never knew how musical Korn could be. They were able to make it so loud, even though they were ""Unplugged.""Great to listen to."
3,"Some songs impress, some songs don't...","First and foremost I applaud Korn for putting themselves out on a limb for doing this type of a performance. I'm a long time fan and approached the album with some reservations.This style of music is not their strong suit but they surprisingly put out some very solid arrangements and performances on this album (Blind, Freak on a Lease, Falling Away From Me). On the flip side some of the songs (Twisted Transistor, Got the Life, Hollow Life) fall short on both arrangement and performance.Korn's music has always lived and died by J. Davis' vocals and the same holds true for this album. On some songs his style fits the music well and on others it is the downfall of the entire song. One has to wonder what the remainder of the band could do with a more vocally 'equipped' frontman (IE: Chino from the Deftones, Serge from S.O.D.)."
2,yuk,I can't understand why this book is getting such good reviews. It was funny. I like books with a lot of sex and romance in them but this one seemed to lack the romance to me. The sex scenes were a little to volgur for my taste. I definately won't be running to get another book from this series. The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because it made me laugh.
4,More of the good stuff,"I really love this series!!!! I love traveling to this new universe and reading about the interactions between the females new to this wonderful way of life and their life mates! If you like adventure and great sex, between people who love each other and are sexually adventurous, this book is for you."
1,Lucia mendez,"Lucia mendez es mi artista favorita , tengo la colleción de la mayoría de sus discos...me gustaria seguir teniendo toda la colección..."
4,What an inspiaration,"One of the best books I have ever read. These guys put the essence of success into simple to understand terms, that really hit home with me.My biggest problem was believing that I could do it, but I think the title of the book really hits the nail on the head...if others can be successful, why not me?I highly recommend this book."
1,Not a good buy!!!,"I bought quite a few books from Amazon.com having lots of books to choose from. This book, being fifteen dollars, is not worth the buy being a KIDS book. Although the picture on the front of the book is great, your wasting your money to get this book. It's a very kiddy book. Hardly any pictures, very few pages, and is a easy reading kids book about buffy. NOT worth it. If you a well worth Buffy book go get the Sunnydale High Yearbook of Sarah Michelle Gellar. Thats a GOOD buy!"
4,Very Happy,"I bought the Marathon pack a couple of weeks ago and I have recorded 8 different training sessions. I really like the ability to download the logs onto the computer and see your improvements and differences between sessions. The coach I think will become more useful when I have recorded a bit more data and it has a better idea of my average week. The strap as mentioned in other reviews is a little annoying, but in my opinion the best looking for the T4, so I trrimmed it down and put a dob of glue to stop it coming loose. The Menu system is a little confusing at first, and probably harder to get used to if you've always used a Polar, but I have no problems with it. I have had no problems with the footpod, other than forgettting to turn it on (not really suunto's fault). I have found the T4 a great tool to keep myself motivated and interested in running. (This is the first HRM I've owned/tried so I think it would be unfair to give it 5* without testing another)"
1,EL PEOR RELOJ,"BASTANTE MALO ESTE PRODUCTO, PRIMERO FUE FALLANDO EL RELOJ Y CUANDO POR FIN LE COMPRÉ EL ACCESORIO A MI BICI, MURIÓ, NADIE SE HIZO RESPONSABLE DE LA COMPOSTURA ME DURÓ MENOS DE UN AÑO Y 400 DLS MENOS, ME NEGABA A LA IDEA DE UN POLAR, PERO NUNCA HE TENIDO UN PROBLEMA CON ESTE EQUIPO. MI HERMANO SE COMPRÓ EL T2 Y SE LE METIÓ EL AGUA....HAY MEJORES OPCIONES TMABIEN ESTÁN LOS ALEMANES PSIGMA, EXCELENTES RELOJES."
5,********** 10 Stars for KMFDM **********,"To all of you KMFDM fans out there who do not own this album... you should be ashamed of yourselves. Symbols is truly the best CD that KMFDM has put out to date. This album exceeds perfection from start to finish. This album is slightly different than previous releases by KMFDM. They incorporated a more electronic feel to their music (without sounding trendy), which I think works out great. The highlights of this release include: the opening track ""Megalomaniac"", ""Leid Und Elend"", ""Anarchy"" (Tim Skold on vocals), and ""Unfit"" (which features Raymond Watts on vocals). Of the hundreds of CDs that I own, the Symbols album definitely falls somewhere in my top ten. This album is highly recommended."
4,a must have disc!!,"KMFDM is truly better than the best. This album is amazingly diverse. From the pounding rythym of Megalomaniac to the metal frenzied Waste, a music lover can't ask for anymore. My personal favorite is Stray Bullet. It is pure song perfection. Anyone who is interested in buying their first KMFDM disc should look no further than Symbols."
5,One of their best,"This was the last truly great KMFDM album, and one of the band's best. It's pretty unanimous among fans new and old that Symbols is not to be missed. In general, KMFDM's sound sways between hard rock and techno from album to album--this particular release slants heavily toward techno. In general, everything that makes KMFDM good is present on this CD: Ray Watts, En Esch, Skold, Ogre, and Guenter provide a perfect sampling of KMFDM's major players on rotation throughout its existence to this point. Abby Travis is also one of the most stand-out guest female vocalists in the bunch. I could go through the tracklist, but must simply state that every song is top-notch, though a couple of 'em took me a bit longer to really notice. This is Sascha and co. at one of their peaks. Quit reading this and buy it."
4,kicks [butt],"This is one of those albums that you don't like at first, but then you pick it up again just to make sure you didn't miss anything good and...bam! You're addicted. Definitely better after the second [or fiftieth] listen, but once it's got you hooked you have to love it.Jumping on the name-the-best-songs bandwagon, I have to say 'Anarchy' is the one that really jumps out at you. Skold has a different and interesting sound that makes for great KMFDM songs. Also good are, of course, 'Megalomaniac,' and then there's 'Stray Bullet,' 'Mercy,' and 'Down and Out.' And the closing track, 'Waste,' is what 'A Drug Against War' wants to be when it grows up: three and a half minutes of frenzied attack on your ears. Awesome. My only complaint would be 'Torture,' but then again I always hated Skinny Puppy. Go figure.All in all, a very good album. Keep on ripping the system, and remember..."
3,return to electronics,"This album contains a bunch of good songs and others which are not bad but simply listenable. I don't like the style of KMFDM in their more guitaristic albums, really, and for me 'ADIOS' is the best KMFDM album; But this album is quite good anyway and anticipates in a way the more electronic style of 'Adios'. I suppose I won't be very original if I say that 'Stray Bullet' or 'Anarchy' are the best tracks here; these two songs are very very good; also 'Mercy' and 'Torture' are very good... but 'Spit Sperm', 'Waste' or 'Down and out' are not what I enjoy listening. All in all, this is not a bad album which fuses the guitar with the electronics in quite a good way; also i like the female vocals, as well as Skold's."
5,THE MIGHTY CORNFLAKE'S REVIEW,"Here we go again. KMFDM are gods the really kick. Just like RAMMSTEIN. I tell ya these German bands can really wail. I'd hate to have to tune their guitars. If you really like ear splitting, head banging, cruising down the road at 90 miles an hour KMFDM is the band to listen to. XTORT and NHIL rock da A**. They put out a winner here. ""Have a little more you just love that stuff. KMFDM a consant intursion it poisons the blood you need an infusion"" KMFDM from the hit cd XTORT"
4,"Not bad, good enough to get you goin","KMFDM's apparently self titled cd isnt the best of the bunch but it has its moments. Meglomaniac is a great song and a few choice others are get to rave to. If you like the strong industrial soind in music, this band is the way to go. RIP THE SYSTEM!"
3,Kein Mitleid Fur Die Mehrheit,"I had the pleasure of seeing these german badboys at their ""beat by beat"" tour some years ago, After that concert I had a new found respect for industrial music scene, and bought the ""virus"" single. Bad %$#! This CD is one of my favorite! With back breaking vocals and pounding guitars how can you go wrong? Yeah baby, you gotta get the KMFDM in your collection. So if your into Skinny Puppy, Rammstien, or Atari Teenage Riot, check these guys out..."
4,This cd is a fine selection of rock and heavy metal,"This cd is a very good example of some of the best rock/heavy metal music that has come out of the 80's. Several songs on their cd, KMFDM are very enjoyable. I believe that they are a talented group. However, they also seem to lack diversity in their music, and most of the songs on this specefic cd are repetetive."
4,Made to Love and More!,"Alright, so I'm the girl who listens to the radio and has no idea who is singing but I love the songs! When ""Made to Love"" came on.....well, I fell in love with it. I know...it's cliche, but it's the truth! So instead of zoning out when the DJ announced the singer, I was hungry for it! And everyone knew I was loving the song because Youtube's link to the video was permanently on my desktop.So I received this album as a gift for Mother's Day and I'm so happy with it! It's a great mix of music, helps lift my mood, and keeps my focus on God.All the songs are fun, but another favorite is ""No Ordinary Love"" because my son and I love to sing the ""MumMumMum"" part...The reason for the 4 stars? Well....I'm one of those people who gives out 5 stars only for my FAVORITES!!!! And while this is a great cd...I have others I still love more. :)"
4,Divercity of sounds,"I've loved DC Talk for years. I think I've seen them more in concert than anyone, but the Newsboys! Here is another hit if you like hard-hitting lyrics mixed with more fun danceable type tunes. Toby pulls it off. Love the one with his son as well. I also love how he mixes several other musically talented peeps into his songs. Well, all I can say is that God gave him a gift and he is using it to the fullest!"
4,Toby Delivers Again,"Back with his third solo album, tobyMac doesn't disappoint. He delivers a disc filled with catchy songs, and on this outing he sings more than he rhymes, which is a welcome change of pace because he sings well, and the rap-core style is becoming a bit outdated. The lead-off single, ""Made to Love"" features an infectious chorus, as well as live strings and horns that add a cool sound to the mix. Other standouts are ""I'm For You"", and ""Face of the Earth."" The track ""Boomin"" is exactly that, and ""Ignition"" also provides fans with a high octane anthem. Another strong cut is ""Lose My Soul"", a prayerful duet with Kirk Franklin that emphasizes focusing on God in the face of the cares of the world. If you've liked Toby's solo stuff in the past, or dc Talk for that matter, this is for you."
5,Love this CD,I think this is his best yet. Lot's of really good jams. Track 13 with Kirk Franklin and Mandesa is my personal favorite but the whole CD is really good.
3,Diverse City's weaker kid brother,"I have to say this album was a disapointment for me. I was looking forward to this very much, and when I picked it up, it felt like I'd heard it before. It feels like Toby is going through the motions on this one. A previous reviewer said this felt like it was rushed, and I totally agree. There are a few good songs, but maybe if he'd waited another year, put some more work on it, this could have been a lot better."
5,Excellent CD in good condition,"The Portable Sounds CD from tobymac is a lot of fun, while challenging the listener to think outside themselves. The CD itself arrived in great condition, with a very small crack in the case."
3,I listened to the remix album,"I can only speak for the remix album. I was disappointed at first when I started to hear the first few remixes. Some of them sounded weaker then the original version. Irene and momentum are amazing songs! I thought the last J-train remix was pretty darn good! i haven't heard the original. I also think the remix with his son was pretty fun and interesting to listen to as well. i would put this as toby mac's best cd, and he certainly has talent. As for the remix album I listened to it was kind of weak and not that great. If you like fun and upbeat music without any dirty language then this is the album for you! Also, if chrisitans are looking for good,clean fun party music then this is a great album to go with."
3,"Some Good Songs, Some Not So Good","As a big dcTalk fan, I have been regularly disappointed by the solo albums of the trio. Their individual stuff is just not in the same league. It is a great example of the whole being far greater than the sum of its parts.In spite of that, this album, like most of the group member's solo albums has some good songs on it. Two of the more pop sounding songs, 'Made To Love' and 'I'm For You' are very good. Another one that I enjoy is 'Lose My Soul' which has a genre that is a bit hard to classify for me.Although I don't think it's a great album, the message is very good and the parts that I don't like are probably more just a matter of taste. My teenage daughter likes it quite a lot."
3,Not Bad at All.,"Portable sounds is a radio friendly offering from Tobymac, so everything on the album is more accesable to more people. Doing this, Toby has made some of his die-hard fans a little restless, the rock is less hard and the Hip-Hop is almost non existant. But there are some good songs. The lyrics are loopy and annoying and a 13 year old could have come up with them. At the end of the day the album is still enjoyable, but nothing on the album is timeless."
3,"Decent, nothing more.","I'm a big fan of Toby. Lately, his music has gone downhill. This album was a HUGE disappointment to me. The commercial pop stuff doesn't sound like TobyMac. It's very watered down beats and tired lyrics. There are a couple of good songs, but I doubt I'll ever put this album back in the CD Player. dc Talk was his prime, Momentum was rockin, Diverse City was good. This, however, utter disappointment."
3,Daliesque acheivement,"Although the visuals in this book do not reflect the plated food at Jean Louis' restaurants, the themes are very representative of his style and imagination. I rarely feel that the food in cookbooks represents what you truly experience in the dining room,....however,.... Jean Louis clearly states his preferences, thoughts and presents food as it should be presented, integrated pure in flavor and beautiful."
2,"Top Quality Pictures, but book is overpriced","Fantastic Pictures,excellent presentation on this acrylic plates, but to much touching and playing with the food (hope he is waring surgeon cloves in his kitchen, when he arranges the dishes for the customers), it is even sometimes nicely written, Jean-Louis keeps mentioning ""when I still was in France, I saw this I made this"". Why didn't he stay there! French Chefs only can cook with the most expensive ingredience, like caviar, truffle, Goose liver, they even using the best wines to cook. Others drink the wine. And for this they get a star or two. The Recipes in this book are definetely not for the day to day cooking. But for professional chefs who know, how to make the same dish as good, but cook it cheaper"
2,Too much! Creativity without thought can upset the stomach.,"The cooking techniques were strong, traditionally French. But the food combinations and the photographs were too much for the eye and the palate. Moreover, I doubt very much the presentations and platings in the book represent what the Chef presents in his Napa restaurant. Though the food at the former Jean-Louis' may have been extraordinary, his book is not. I am disappointed that such a great chef was led astray by an over estimated photographer, whos photos take one back to the earily 80's, and aparently a lost literary agent who doesn't know the difference between an apple and an orange. **"
2,Music Theory 101,"This book is basically music theory for the beginner, written in a hip and readable fashion. The title however is misleading. Obviously, you need to know chord structures to do jazz improvisation, and the book does contain a laundry list of jazz CDs to pursue. But that's about it. There is absolutely nothing about jazz instrumentation, arranging, rhythms, or scoring. If you're an absolute beginner, you may find this book useful. If you're a working musician, forget it."
5,brought back memories,Loved this CD.Brought back a lot of memories dancing close to the guy you thought you would be with forever.And the heartache of knowing he wasn't the one.Love it I play it everyday.I don't leave my house without it.I listen to it in my car.And sing along.Those were the days.
5,Daughter can't get enough,"My 10-yr-old loved this book and has been asking for more of these series of mysteries. I haven't found them in the stores easily, but I highly recommend it."
1,Seems to be missing something.,"An American Story is about a group of WWII veterns who return home to cope with their changed lives. The current mayor has shaken up their town while they were overseas, so the veterns decide to run for office to try and change things. This movie follows several different characters who are undeveloped and in the end of the movie, some of the conflicts remained unresolved.A better hallmark movie that has the WWII theme involved in it, is Miss Rose White, check this one out if you are interested."
3,Snore,"While the field of Mental Health Counseling is only a few decades old, this book makes it feel as if there are hundreds of years of history to cover. I will give the authors credit for compiling a wide varitey of essays on a broad range of topics; however, I can guarantee that this will be used more as a paperweight than as an actual reference text. There are much more interesting and insightful articles about current and past trends in MH counseling to be found on-line and through various academic/university libraries. In short, a lot of money for what could be found with solid research skills."
2,Did not work for me,I did not loose any weight. As a laxative - good but as a slimming tea - not so much. I would not recommend it for people who wants to loose weight.
4,Challenging to adapt for those unable to tolerate dairy,"I found this book to be very informative. It provides you with the basics of the plan and gives useful tips for eating away from home. I have not yet tried any of the recipes, but they sound good.Being allergic to cow dairy products, it is going to take a lot of effort to alter the diet and stay within the 40-30-30 guidelines. It would have been nice if the authors had given consideration to the many people like me who cannot tolerate dairy products."
1,The Diet from HELL,"This book should never be sold to private parties. It should be used only in an institution, as a form of punishment, and under direct supervision."
1,disppointed,"this book might work for someone who is active, single and healthy... its complicated, restrictive and diffuclt.though I agree with the authors premise, in times past we were healthier and more active, this is now and lifestyles are vastly different. cooking for a family as prescribed does not work...."
5,A Plan For Life,"Most of us go through life with very little knowledge of how to eat. We pick up pieces of information here and there or follow a variety of fad diets that are too restrictive to stay on for any sustained period of time.This diet is not focused on the getting thin quick, although you will notice results within the first week. Instead, it presents you with an eating regimen that is balanced, sustainable and easy to fit into a modern lifestyle. And the food is Yummy too!I now have an eating plan to last me a lifetime, I have reached my target weight and body proportions, and I have seen a profound effect on my mental atitude and approach to life.You must buy this book!"
4,The only diet that works for me,I have tried everything from high protein to weight watchers. My problem is not feeling full and being sooo easy to cheat.I did this diet over a year ago and lost 10lbs in about 2 months with no exercise!!! I got off of it due to the planning and expensive portion of it. It is a very hard diet to follow! But if given the chance it does wonders!!! I am now restarting the program!!
2,not for people with diabetes,"for starters, I don't understand how granulated fructose is commercially available to people. 2nd, I have no idea why the authors of this book actually think it's not unhealthy to add such large amounts of granulated fructose to your meals. do a google search for ""dangers of fructose"" to see what I mean. everything from exacerbating gout to decreasing nitric oxide levels in the blood to being the most unhealthy form of carbohydrate a diabetic can ingest. don't be fooled into thinking it's ok to use because it ""comes from fruit!"""
3,Where is the index?,"There is one major problem with this book -- no index. I found myself continually flipping pages to locate a recipe or part of the text I wanted to refer back to or read again. With this much information, it is necessary to include an index for the reader. Another thing I noticed was that quite a bit of the exact same information is repeated in different parts of the book. On the positive side, there really are some good recipes in the book - try the shreadded chicken. Overall, I was disappointed in the organization of the book."
4,40-30-30 Formula,Book was listed as used but the one we received was in very good shape and is being used daily.
2,Not for the Kindle,"From the other reviews, the plan looks great. However, you should not purchase the Kindle version. All the food plans and recipes are represented as graphics. The text is small and colored a light grey. I can read any of the plans or recipes. Because they are graphics you can't change the size of the types. Might be a good book, just not for the Kindle."
3,Nothing new here,"While I believe in 40-30-30 nutrition as a weight loss program and lifestyle, this book does not have anything the first book didin't. In fact I think the first book had more. Plus is was a small handy nice looking book. This one is large, doublespaced with large margins....like it's trying to ""look"" like a comprehensive book to justify the price. Luckily, I didn't buy the hardcover...definitely not worth the cover price! It also doesn't read professionally; it sounds sort of amateur and not really very scientifically based. I will keep it on the shelf for the meals, but I willl probably refer to the first book (40-30-30 Fat Burning Nutrition)much more often. I had spent $3.00 to get their meal planner booklet when I bought the first book and found all the meals in The Formula to also be in my $3.00 booklet.....still it's fun to get re-motivated by reading a new book!!!!!!!"
2,"If you've read The Zone, skip this one","I'm a Zone fan and I was sorely disappointed in this book. Their way of calculating ""blocks"" is no easier than Sears' method - in fact, it's more complicated, unless you have a calculator on you at all times. They don't say anything that Sears didn't cover.It might be worth buying for the recipes - I tried one of the cheesecakes which was pretty good.There's a lot of ""fluff"" in this book. Not sure if it's worth the hard cover price!"
1,don't bother buying,the website where the source code is supposed to be no longer exists.www.guide-to-csharp.net
4,A good read,"I've read many books about the Vietnam war and this is one of the better ones. Some of the Digger language threw me from time to time but eventually became second nature as I read on. This is an honest account of how it was over there. Since I am a dog lover I was saddened to see the terrible effect jungle warfare had on not only the men, but also those poor war dogs who had no choice in the matter. If you don't want to get your heart broken do not read this book. Hats off to all those who went through that nightmare...especially the tracking dogs."
3,Its Okay,"I was expecting more for the cost. There was more assembly required than I was expecting. You need some skills. The reality of most products for me is how they last in the long run. So new out of the box, its a nice table. I was trying to save the tax. If I did it again, I would buy at Costco or Walmart or Big 5, etc."
5,One of the best Nina CDs Ever!,"This CD is like a timeline that documents all of the styles Nina experimented with in her 30 year career. Because of this, this CD has a large variety of tracks with unique and unusual style. The style of music on this CD spans from old fashioned German Cabaret to funky Reggae with New Wave and Punk in between. All the songs are in chronological order, so you can see all the improvements and changes Nina's made over the years. The songs themselves are all masterpieces that make most of the pop of today look like the trash it is. All of Nina's songs, not only the ones included on this album, are well thought out, clever, and artistic.In edition to being one of the most creative musicians of her time, Nina has an amazing vocal range to complement her creativity. This CD is an incarnation of all that creativity. If you are a collector of Nina's music, this CD is really fantastic because it contains her early work that is incredibly hard to come by."
4,Entertaining German lunacy........,"very interesting compilation of Early Nina flexing her various styles.There are 2 versions of this cd where song 15 is different depending which cd you have. One one version, the song SONNTAGMORGEN is present, and on the other version the song Michail, Michail is in it's place.A very good cd, but hardly worth $141.00 like a few people are trying to sell it here for."
5,Super Fast!,"I bought this hard drive not too long ago, and it is blazing fast! The SATAII interface makes transfers much faster then IDE, and the 16MB cache along with the new perpendicular recording make it even faster!"
1,Failed in less than one year.,"I bought this to back up important data on my iMac. The drive gave some warning signs before it completely broke down, so I thankfully was able to retrieve the data. However, I am very disappointed that it failed so quickly."
4,See Great Musicians on display,"I'm not a big fan of the smooth jazz genre because I feel that the music is too repetative, but I do own this DVD and it is quite good. I enjoyed the performances by all the members in the band and they all showed their own reconized talent."
5,BOB JAMES AND FOUR PLAY,Bob James: An Evening of Fourplay Vol 1 & 2GREAT IT WAS ALMOST LIKE I WAS THERE PERFECT ARRANGEMENTS. LEE RITENOUR IS STILL ONE OF THE GREATEST GUITAR PLAYERS AROUND AND HARVEY MASON IS STILL THE BEST DRUMMER AROUND. NATHAN EAST IS DOES A GREAT JOB ON THE VOCALS. AND WHAT MORE CAN YOU SAY ABOUT BOB JAMES. EXCEPT HE IS ONE OF THE GREATEST AROUND.
5,smooth jazz heaven!!,"If you are a TRUE FAN of Lee, Bob, Harvey and/or Nathan then you have GOT to see this! As a jazz artist myself, these are the guys that I look up to.The sound is pristine having been recording live in a recording studio. Overdubs came out perfect. A must have!!"
5,great reading,If you want a thorough look at the life of Jesus Christ done in sequential order this is the book to read. The background material is very useful in understanding the times in which Jesus lived. A must read for any Bible student.
2,Take a pass on this one and wait for the 2nd Edition,"The Editors at Wrox are to blame for this one. The Authors have plenty to say, but the design and layout make it an impossible read. Who came up with such small type and putting the code behind a gray backgound? The index is also poorly layed out, not nearly enough entries. It's a shame because we need a book like this."
1,Poorly Targeted and Concieved.,"Pass on this one. This book a loose collection of unrelated articles. It passes neither as a primer nor as an advanced reference. The index is a mess, i.e. ""ActiveCell"" isn't there; half the book (352 pages) is listing (without discussion)of the Excel and VBE object model; and the automation chapter begins with a discalimer that ""We will not attempt to give detailed explanations..."". On the bright side, there are a few gems buried within the drivel and your foot won't get broke if you drop this book on it."
1,Needs Major Editorial Work,"This book had potential, but it is so full of errors that it is practically useless. It needs a good editor with lots of patience and time to make the corrections."
3,Useful Portion is Short,"Pages 7-254 cover EXCEL and VBA. Pages 257-264 cover ""international issues"", which has a limited audience in the USA. Pages 289-321 deal with the VBE. Pages 345-630 are a listing of the EXCEL Object Model, which I find none too useful. Likewise, pages 665-695 list the VBE Object Model, again not too useful to me.This book can be compared to Kofler ""Definitive Guide to EXCEL VBA"", which is 776 pages of exposition and pages 777-834 a listing of the most useful parts of the EXCEL Object Model, ADO, MS forms, Office, Binder, Scripting, VBA and VBE. Thus, you get a much more extensive discussion of how things work and how things fit together than is found in Green (or in Walkenbach, for that matter). Kofler also deals with international issues here and there. However, Green is a lot cheaper, and sometimes its compactness makes it easier to find things.Bottom line: Buy Green first (cheapest), Kofler second and Walkenbach last"
2,Horrible index,"This book would have gotten 4 stars from me if it were not for the index. For example, in one short block of code, I tried looking up Resize, What:, LookAt, xlWhole, LookIn, and Is Nothing. Resize is found in the index under ""Range,"" and the only reason I found it is that they are both under ""R."" As for the others, I have no idea where to find them in the book. Or try looking up less obscure items like Offset, Integer, InStr, GetName, or Get anything (there are no listings for ""G"" in the index). With the ability to create a computerized index, there is no excuse for this laziness. It cuts the usefulness of the book in half. You need another book with a good index to find almost anything.If you are relentless in finding a solution, you can slog your way through this book a page at a time, and you just might find exactly what you need. But then again, you might not."
4,Gold Coin,I received this book on time and it was in excellent condition. The only reason for a 4 star rating vs a 5 star is that it had information from a library within it and caused me to wonder if the book was borrowed indefinitely from said library.
1,Almost unintelligible,"A previous review says that this book is about the ""human heart trying to understand itself"", but I found it daunting for my human heart to understand this book. I was assigned this text book in college, and I suspect in that in academia there is a ""Emperor Has No Clothes"" phenomenon, where people are averse to criticising badly written books for fear of appearing intellectually deficient. While I do not doubt Ms. Nussbaum's intellectual capabilities, she needs to adopt a more clear writing style."
3,"Not bad, but what is the novelty?","Every time I hear this album album, and most other music Autechre made, I have to think of the album ""Trip Into the Body"" made in the early 1980s by Johan Timman. Of course, that album lacked the hippety-hoppety beats that got invented much later... but many of the sounds are really the same. Where Timman showed quite impressive compositional and arranging skills, Autechre seems to have a thing for minimalistic tunes. Their music is even overly simplistic at times, leaning heavily on the sounds themselves, what often doesn't make their tunes the most exciting. The good tunes are very good though, so it kind of evens out."
3,Repetae is right...,"This is an excellent, scary electronic album, but it is so ungodly repetitive I cannot listen to it unless I'm engaged in some other activity. The songs loop and loop and loop in their electronic minimalist way until it's hard to take. Some of the melodies are quite interesting. I think if they had perhaps varied the sound a bit, or if they wanted to keep their cool insectoid/pure robotic motif intact reduce the number of times each layer is repeated, then this would be an excellent album. But as it is, if you're used to the spastic, short, and consistantly interesting sounds of newer Aphex Twin or Squarepusher or any of the less mainstream semi-organic IDM artists, stay away from this! Download a few MP3s first and see if you can stomach it."
3,"see: ""clipper""","this cd is so harsh, so.....umm....mechanical, that it is very hard to listen to. but, after a few listens, it really grabbed me.in my opinion, the best song on this cd is the second song on the first disc: ""clipper""this song is scary. this is the only song i have ever heard that scared me. literally, i was shaking. trembling. it was an emotional overload......this song is powerful in ways that no other song is (or could ever hope to be).i'm giving this cd three stars. but, only because of the song ""clipper"".absolutely amazing.buy this cd for ""clipper"" or, download ""clipper"" off of kazaa. i don't care. but you need, no, you MUST hear this song."
2,Not the best example of the genre,"This record has its moments, but to be honest I find that nearly all the tracks go on far too long, with ""Clipper"" and ""Eutow"" the only really memorable tracks. Much of it is very repetitive (in a bad way) with not quite enough depth to the sound and a general lessening in creativity than was found on the vastly superior ""Amber"" album. I admire Autechre for doing their own thing, but it does seem that their music, while trying to stray further from the mainstream is also straying from the realms of listenability, as evidenced by this year's frankly dire ""ep7"". It's different, yes, but is it any good?"
1,Garbage,"I finally decided to pick up this album because in the underground music scene, Autechre has been consistantly put on pedestals & hailed as inovators and geniuses etc. etc. etc. Now, i know this is older material, and i also know that their newer releases are supposedly much more progressive and groundbreaking, but i've heard from a lot of fans that this CD is among their best work. All that aside, the music sounds to me like a couple of intelligent kids with no musical training or ability (& not much an idea of what they're doing) tinkering with some electronic equipment in their bedroom studio. The musical structres are boring, repetative, annoying, and lack any kind of soul. Is this really music? I would have to rank this among the worst electronic albums i've heard thus far, so if you have bad taste in this genre of music, i'd highly recommend this CD. ""Garbage"", the 2nd EP included in this package adequately sums it up for me."
4,Great Review Book,"This book has a lot of specific information, but the best part is it is tied to the reference book from class, when you miss a question, it tells you where to go in the book to get the correct answer. Very helpful!"
5,good study material,I love the book to use as study material! Great info! Great setup! Only problem I had was that I ordered first book from goodwill site and it was written in and so of no use. Ordered second from different company and came in perfect condition!
1,Poor review book!,"I am at the very end of my paramedic class and I am doing quite well both in the field (my rotations are over), and in the classroom.This book has very little to do with actually being a paramedic. There is so much useless garbage in here that if you took the time to learn it, you are missing out on other valuable information.This text book might be good for a family docotor who needs to review things like looking in someones ear or checking for swollen lymphs, but if your doing that in the field, your wasting your time and the time of your patient.I would say that a lot of text revolves around things we dont see in the field, but sadly people do call 911 for EVERYTHING. That doesnt mean you should be treating it though, we are emergency care, not difinitive care."
2,Not a good book (especially for the price!),"I'm teaching a basic stats class out of this book, and I find it to be pretty bad. I don't mind the fact that the author tried to water some things down. It is an introductory text, after all. I mind that he watered it down too much, however. Some basic key ideas are completely missing (for example, when discussing probability, he skips defining a sample space.) Some of the exercises and examples were also worded fairly poorly. I would also like to see some more computational examples throughout the text.In the end, I suppose the text is serviceable if the instructor is willing to supplement some material. In fact, supplementation is essential if you don't want to burn through this text in half a semester."
4,Excellent Condition,I received this book in exactly the condition that was advertised and managed to save several dollars over anywhere else. I alway check Amazon for textbooks before making my purchase.
2,Not what i was expecting,"The title of this book had me thinking it was about astrology, which it is not. I was looking for a reference book on zodiac signs and this is not it. Its a novel about something totally different. I felt the title was a little misleading with limited to no content description. My mistake."
2,out of date hard to read,I have been doing astrology for 40 years and thought I would enloy this book but it was very hard to reaad and too boring for me so needless to say I did not read much of it.
4,Best as a Styling Aid,"These are 3"" styling clips perfect for sectioning hair.I wouldn't use them for hair ornamentation, because they look very utilitarian, but that's my preference. The colors I received: 3 white, 3 black, 2 light pink, 2 dark pink and 2 aquagreen."
4,colors are wrong in description,hello everyone.these clips are great. except in the package i received my clips were green pink purple and blue.DEFINATELY not the colors in the photo. just a warning for you guys!!
1,Garbage!,Once again a book that is nothing but pure trash. Why Amazon would even offer this slanderous book is beyond me.
1,Why is this rubbish still available through Amazon?,It's all been proven to be lies concocted for the purpose of earning filthy dollars for scum such as the author of this book and the various media snakes who make a living by selling sensationalised lies. Anything for money. Do your research people. There is plenty of information out there proving that the contents of this book is all lies. The truth makes much more interesting reading.

1,"Did;nt read it, Would'nt read it.","the selling of this book is a testament to the thousands of people who just did'nt get it when it came to the man Michael Jackson. it is not however a surprise to see such untalented sewage on the market. the next question is WHO is reading this book? WHO is writting this book, perhaps we should be having a peek at they're hard drives. as for diane diamond...what a sad story her career is,"
1,Absolute Nonsense,IF MORE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD WAS AS GREAT AN HUMANITARIAN AS MICHAEL JACKSON WAS THEN THE WORLD WOULD NOT BE FILLED WITH ALL THIS NONSENSE....
5,A PAGE TURNER,"I read this book and how sad. This boy was in love with MJ. How sad that MJ seduced this CHILD. (According to this book) I was a fan of MJ however after reading this book I felt USED! I also felt that my money I paid for MJ music went into a $20,000,000 pay off to keep thiss boy from going to court! Now this book goes into detail about the relationship between the two! From the begining to the very end! EVERYONE should read this book! You will see where there is smoke there is a FORREST FIRE!!!"
1,Don't be fooled by this garbage,"People don't waste your money on this garbage. It is just another member of Jordy's family trying to make money out of Michael Jackson. If you want to know the truth search on google for the GQ magazine article on the Jordy Chandler case - this will tell you all you need to know AND that Jordy Chandler's family are a bunch of money grabbing lying swindlers. Michael Jackson has not and never will molest, abuse or hurt a child."
1,Really?,"The fact that Jordie Chandler recently admitted (like 2 days after Michael died) that Jackson never molested him or was in any way inappropriate with him, should tell you everything you need to know about the total fabrication of this ""book."""
1,"I'm Just Wonderin', Why Y'all Think...","...That this book is any good. I'm sorry but this is the worst sort of sensationalistic tripe. The facts are muddled...BECAUSE THERE ARE NO FACTS. None. If I had seen one piece of reliable ""evidence"", I could have written a better review, but I have not. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE and this book is, in a word (dare I say it?) BAD. And not in a good way :^P I put a star because it's a required field--the only thing this piece of excrement deserves is a garbage can. :^P"
1,WOW,"I just can't imagine any parent helping write a writer such a book, I can't believe this. I wonder why write a BOOK, and not go to the POLICE, I find the whole story FISHY. Anybody with kids would want an ABUSER in JAIL, and will not go around writing BOOKS. geez."
1,Why so much?,Why is this book so much? It's obviously all about the kid's family being money hungry.
1,Do we really need more tabloid garbage?,"Don't waste your time with this ""factual"" book.This book is proof that people will do anything for money. If Evan Chandler really cared about his son, why would he throw him into the public eye the way he did? Wouldn't a good parent keep their child protected?This book is horrible, one sided, and is full of baseless facts. It's media and tabloid garbage that should have been ignored back in 1993. Police didn't find an iota of evidence that proved Mister Jackson guilty of any crime, I don't see how this book has helped me discover any ""truths"".I gave this book one star because it was required, but I didn't mean it."
1,Garbage!,Don't waste your money on lies!!! Michael JAckson can not defend himself and this book is hurtful toward his children!!! The author did not get reliable information just wants to make money off Michaels Misery!!!
1,Why is Amazon selling such Trash - Please Remove!,This book is full of lies and Michael Jackson sued the author for defamation of character and won the case. However the author then left the country so he wouldn't have to pay the judgement against him. Shame on Amazon for supporting such a trashy untrue book! Please remove your sale of this book immediately!
1,Book based on Slander,"I would like to inform you that this book has been written by a man who was sued by Michael Jackson for slander, and had to run away form the US because he did not have money to pay the amount of 2.7 million dolars to Michael Jackson.Heis also part of the North American Man/Boy Love Association, which is another reason why he would write so many lies about the false accusations in a book.This book is based on slander. It should not be for sale."
2,The book was not worth the cost.,"I do not think the book is worth the money. Bascially...he did it and the parents wanted the money so they charges were dropped. There is some ok stuff in this book... BUT NOT for $130.For the MJ fans who say they know he didn't do it. Then let your kids spend the night at his house and see what happens then since he is soooo not gulity.The book is trash, true somewhat....but not the best I have read. Could have been better"
1,What a shame!,"Why Amazon offers a junk like this book to sell between so good books about Michael Jackson??? This only can be a joke! U$ 500,00??? Who will be so stupid? It's an invitation to spend your U$500,00 buying books with wonderful pictures of Michael (like MJ Before He Was King) or a precious book like Dancing the Dream written by himself and many others that are reliable and tell the truth.The author is a tabloid writer not a book writer and was sued by MJ and lost .The secret diary never existed.Jordy Chandler couldn't have never spoken with nobody about anything related to the case after the settlement. Contract signed before the judge.The book was banned.So WHY ?????? Please, come on!!! Don't even look at the title of this garbage."
1,garbage,"First this book is over price bought mine for 1.00 at second hand store. All these people that read this book I would say are poeple that thrive on the enquire magazine and believe every word! This book is based on a father and a son that worked so well together to bilk a insurance co. outof a lot of money. They didn't find anything here that said michael jackson was guilty and the second time they didn't find him guilty. No one wants to see any child molested in this book a father and son took something that another child has endured and used it as a money for gaingame, and don't forget the author is just as low because he play right along with them to make money . that star is only there because you have to rate. What away for a father to start his son out in life as a lier and thief."
1,Shame On Amazon for selling this book!,"I can't believe that Amazon is selling this trash! What ever go around comes around. Jordie and Gavin, until you two come clean, I wish you both a miserably life. I hope Jordie's father is in hell for what he did to Michael. Not only did he do an evil act to Michael, he did to his familym, his true friends, and to his fans. May he Rest In Peace. To All Who Did Bad, Evil & Dishonest things to Michael, I HOPE YOU ALL ARE LIVING YOUR OWN HELL."
1,He clearly was'nt,I think that enough people have made enough money from Michael Jacksons brand. Itis time for the lies to stop. Only a pervert would want to read this book in my opinion.
1,Absolute Rubbish! Flush your $ instead!,"This book is a joke right? This guy was sued, lost, and skipped the country to avoid paying. He is notorious for trying to make money off the back of Michael Jackson. He is pond scum and shouldn't be taken seriously no matter how many books he writes. You are better off flushing your money down the toilet. If you want real information on Michael Jackson read ""The Michael Jackson Conspiracy"" by Aphrodite Jones or ""Redemption"" by Geraldine Hughes, even ""You Are Not Alone, Michael"" by Jermaine Jackson."
4,Cork Boat,"John Pollack's tight and engaging style makes Cork Boat an easy and pleasurable read. His ability to render vivid memories, and to make them accessible to his audience reflect the talent that gained him a job as a Presidential speechwriter. Equal parts real-life character development and international adventure story, Cork Boat is an inspiration!"
5,A surprisingly darn good book,"I didn't have high expectations when I picked up this book but I had earlier read about the odd effort to build Cork Boat in the Washington Post, so I decided to give it a try.It was actually a remarkable story, a rockin' good tale of whimsy, adventure, and the indominable spirit that has made this country what it is. I read the whole thing in an afternoon and almost one sitting. Don't miss out."
1,Sunk,"While the subject matter makes it painfully easy to make nautical puns... I will simply say that I could not force myself to finish. Was it the bad writing, the unsympathetic narrator, the terrible pacing?Yes - and much, much more. This would be an amusing magazine or newspaper article..."
4,A real life fantasy come true,"The author, a former speechwriter for a Congressman and Clinton, quits his job to build a boat made out of 165,000-plus corks held together by rubberbands, which he then sails with friends down the Douro River in Portugal. It sounds like a fairy tale, and it practically is, a heart-warming true fantasy story of childhood dreams and adult sacrifice and priorities and adventure. Pollack is, of course, a gifted writer, adept at spinning a tale and interweaving personal remenisces, anecdotes and a few strands of history here and there. But it's Pollack's determination and optimism, though, that make this such a sweet story. After the descriptions of camraderie, community, despair and dedication, I felt like cheering along as they pulled into Porto on the final day."
4,Some people have way too much time on their hands.,"Like so many things, alcohol is involved in making a good story that will make you smile. This is not rocket science, it's a childish day dream that some adults brought to life with the help of vintners from all over.If you've ever played with the cork of a wine bottle, you know the subject of this book. There is something that just makes you smile when you think of taking a silly thought and pursuing it to a `logical'(?) conclusion.This book probably won't change your life, but it will probably make you smile. And, maybe, just maybe, if you had a childish or alcohol fueled inspiration....."
1,Returning this toy,"We bought this toy for our daughters 8th bithday. She was so excited. We put in 4D batteries. They lasted about 3 min. So we went on a search for an outlet adapter. The company will sell it to you for an additional $16.00. Radio shack doesn't have the right adapter. Another electronics store had the right adapter, but said the company made it a very hard size to find. Then after all of that the wheel stalled and hasen't worked since. So to rate this toy for fun would be hard to do. We haven't even gotten started and the machine is unworkable."
1,A disservice to children,"After teaching elementary art in Fairfax County Virginia for 19 years and currently owning a pottery buisness in Door County,Wisconsin, I should have known better. But when my granddaughter wanted a more expensive model of this toy it was hers. Neither she nor I could throw a pot on the wheel. Children can learn to throw a pot on a profesional potter's wheel. All this toy did was set her up for failure. These toy wheels are a disservice to children and should not be sold by a business of your calibre."
4,Add AC adaptor and it works great!,"We got this for my 8 year old daughter. My husband modified the power source and addes an AC adaptor to it and it has enough power now to make pots, cups, vases, etc. My daughter loves it!"
1,The worst toy I ever had,"I got the toy for my 8th birthday. It was very hard to use and I could never get one thing done by the toy even with some help. My big sister got the same toy 6 years age and she told me it was the worst toy she had. I didn't believe her until I started to play with it. Now it end up I can just play with the dough. It is truly the worst toy I ever got, as well. My mom was wondering why such a bad toy could last so many years in the market."
1,This did not last long,I bought this pottery wheel for christmas and I was looking foward to using it. I used it for about 5 minutes because i was about to go away for a aouple of nights and needed to start packing. I came back home and went to my pottery wheel and it would not start. I realized that I had left the on switch on. I went to the store and bought new batteries for it. It still did not work!! It made me so mad. This toy would have been So much fun if it would have worked.
3,I broke my computer with this product.,"This product does what it says on its description. But It's hard to install in my computer. My machine is Insignia D300a,which has Pentium 4(socket 478). Therefore I have to follow Socket 478 procedure. I have put 2 little bridge thing in above of my CPU and drived screws on it. I used long screws. I had to use short screws but I read the document. But short screws were looked to short to me. I though It would not reach thoes 2 bridges. Because I have used 2 long screws, Screws reached to surface of motherboard and cut few lines in circuit. I need a motherboard(Socket 478) now for my desktop. After then, I installed this cpu fan in my other computer in kichine. And it's queit and good. But it's too hard to install for me. Maybe it's easy for people who open compueter box often and if the box is large enough for this cooler"
4,Great book,Studies in Etymology was a super book. I used it when teaching in a gifted program this summer and found it quite useful. Anyone teaching Latin and the importance of derivatives would also find this worth using!Dr. Freeman
4,Una buena segunda parte,"del volumen I. Tal vez más fácil de leer, ya que resulta muy entrenida la matemática precisión de los autores con respecto a las historias. Además, ponen al descubierto la situación de los guionistas. Las estrellas mencionadas lo eran desde una perspectiva industrial y el análisis que se hace tal vez pudo haber sido más extenso. Párrafo aparte merece el último capítulo donde se traen a colación por vez primera datos que hasta el momento nadie había supuesto existentes.fleurette bleue"
3,Tampoco se puede entender,cómo un libro más que discreto puede generar semejante polémica. En Argentina no suelen publicarse libros como éste y una vez que se publica algunos lo atacan. No se entiende nada. Gracias
2,Lili es trucha,y no vive en España. Los españoles no usan ese término. Debería saber que Cine Sonoro Argentino no es un libro para gente ignorante. La trucha es ella.
4,Hush hush sweet readers,Slumber my darlings. Where`s the scandal? This book about Argentine cinema is quite all right. I dont understand why the rage -or envy-. I`m learning Latin American cinema as well as Spanish and it has been very useful to me. Journalism is not and inaccuracies I can`t detect. Thanks to all and will you please stop the war?
1,Este libro es la guía de teléfonos,"Con todas estas estrellas dadas por lectores truchos caímos en la trampa y lo compramos. Amazon no debería suprimir sistemáticamente las críticas negativas, y ofrecer información más objetiva a sus clientes. Este libro es aburrido y pretencioso."
1,Lástima que el contenido decepcione tanto,"Debido a mi profesión leo casi todo lo que se publica sobre este tema (bien limitado y especializado) del cine lationamericano de los 30 y 40. Este libro no aporta nada nuevo a lo ya publicado por otros autores (lo que explica seguro que la crítica hispanófona lo haya ignorado totalmente). Los autores insisten demasiado sobre aspectos excesivamente parcelarios e irrelevantes del período tratado. Por otra parte pude comprobar también la presencia de muchas imprecisiones y desgraciadamente una enorme cantidad de errores o de inexactitudes. Como base de investigación prefiero de lejos el Diccionario de Directores del Cine Argentino: de Comienzos del Sonoro a Nuestros Dias de Adolfo C. Martinez mucho más accesible, preciso y pertinente."
5,Next best thing.,The Flybar is quickly making its rounds in the pro bike and skateboard world. The Flybar starts as fun to bounce on then quickly makes you obsessed with going higher and doing more and more manuevers. Good fun and a workout too.
5,Awesome power!,"This thing is so easy to use! One time me and my friends were having a competition to see how high we could get (lol) and after a 6 foot bounce, I came down and slipped but the Flybar bounced through my bottom jaw shattering it! I was fine after a few months but this thing has a lot of power!"
1,Simply Awful!!!!!,"This applies to the audio book. I love the Hamish MacBeth series, so I decided to listen to this Agatha Raisen audio book. Really dumb and no point to it really. It goes on and on and on and on with no point to it. I won't get another one, that's for sure. Very dissapointing!"
2,Agatha and the revolving cast,"Firstly, I was turned off by the redundancy of the title of Agatha's latest outing.The gimmick employed for ""The Perfect Paragon"" is the same as in her past novels. In the past, Agatha has leeched romantic stimulus and momentum from a revolving cast of male characters who have occupied the neighboring cottage that poor Agatha's estranged husband, James Lacey owns. With Agatha's ill-starred sex life on the back burner, ""The Perfect Paragon"" gives us a complete turnover in her detective agency staff in a bid make Agatha still seem interesting.Since they are devoid of any depth of characterization, the narrative also makes few demands on its audience either to think or to feel. The Agatha Raisin series is a harmless way to while away a few hours.As for the surprise ending, I can only think: the more things change, the more they stay the same."
3,Disappointing,"I am a long-time fan of Agatha Raisin, having read every one of the books in this series. What I liked best about this series-- the charm of the Cotswolds, the affectionate way in which the author portrays Agatha with all her foibles, the humor of her near disasters--has been gradually eroding ever since Agatha opened her own detective agency. I find the continual stream of irrelevant lost dogs and cats to be distracting. The change of setting is also a disappointment. With the recent addition of lurid murders, I am not sure I want to read the rest of Agatha Raisin's adventures. At this point she is turning into just another detective."
2,"More characters, less plot, no interest","Unfortunetly what was once a good series of stories has dipped with the publication of the last two stories - coincidencing with a change of emphasis in the plotline.Out as gone the bitchy amatuer Agatha and the well developed characters to be replaced with an Agatha who now cares about peoples feelings. For regular readers of the books, they will know that Agatha is not one for mellowing.The characters which now surround her are at best poorly developed and are just too good to be true. Any obstacle is now easily overcome, any guess now becomes a fact and with it, the interest has vanished.There is a chance to turn around the padded out plots with book 17 but I doubt we will see it happen. Much the pity, for there is a great character here which is being poorly utilised."
3,The Perfect Paragon,I have always loved Agatha Raisin. As a matter of fact I got my mother and sister hooked on her also. I was very disappointed in this book. Agatha has lost her spark and fiesty disposition. She needs to drop the detective agency as it makes the story too scattered. Even the love interest fizzled before any fire started. Hope the next one is a gem!
1,It should be no stars!,"This muddled book isn't worth the readers time or money! M. C must have needed a few extra quid and threw this mess together over a weekend.The book has no plot line and the characters are nothing more than cut outs pasted to the pages.It stands alone as the all time worse book ever published by this usually outstanding author. Do not give up hope however. On the last page Agatha opens the door and there stands...James! I see a sequal in our future. Hopefully, because Agatha's sexual problems are getting very old hat"
4,Ms. Beaton pens a perfect cozy!,"No one can write cozy mysteries like Ms. Beaton, and this new addition to the Agatha Raisin series is pure delight. I was finding Agatha getting a tiny bit tiring after the last book, but Ms. Beaton has breathed new life into her with her running her own detective agency. For one thing, Agatha does not have as much time to feel sorry for herself because she's busy solving cases. We are also treated to some wonderful new characters in this book. Harry is an absolute marvel! Ms. Beaton does such a good job with her characters! In this book Agatha is involved in trying to solve three seemingly unrelated murders, and her and her army of helpers are kept busy trying to keep on top of all three cases. But never fear, good old Aggie figures it all out. This series is an absolute delight, and I recommend it hightly to those wanting to read a good cozy."
3,Somewhat Disappointing...,"I have loved the Agatha Raisin series from the very first one, but found this one as well as the one prior a bit disappointing. Too many extra characters, and Agatha seems to be mellowing - I loved her nastiness! I felt like the story was verging on an episode of the BBC's Hetty Wainwright series. The ending really wasn't a surprise- knew it would happen sooner or later."
3,"Agatha, please go back home","I have read all of the Agatha Raisin books by M.C. Beaton. They have been fun reading. However, the last two books where Ms.Raisin opens a detective agency have been tough reading. I think the reason is because there seem to be just too many characters to keep track of; especially, if you put the book down for more than a day."
2,Only the Jay-Z and Jadakiss solo cuts are live.,"The Jay-Z and Jadakiss solo songs are the only two live songs on the album but the rest of the songs are tolerable. Therefore, if you are a Jay-Z fan buy the CD for the Jigga song like I did but if not, leave it in the store."
4,The whole album is banging,The whole album is tight and I especially like that collaberation with Drag-On and Juvenille. Swizz did a good job producing this album. This is a must-have. One more thing I know Jay-Z song is tight but what is doing with a song by himself he isn't a Ruff Ryder.
1,"The ""Ruff Ryders"" try to con us out of our hard-earned money",DMX and his so-called crew is pure crap. None of the songs on this album live up to any of the hype. What has happened to rap?
4,They're pretty good...,"I would have to say this doesn't deserve a full 5 stars, but pretty close. This album is pretty solid. It's form is good, there are 15 tracks of hard core rap, and there are alot of really good rappers on there already with solo careers (DMX, Eve, Ma$e, Big Pun-R.I.P., Jay-Z, Swizz, etc.). I would have to say this album is spread out and all wit it...although there are some bad spots and weaknesses in this cd...No.1-There are some songs that aren't worth listening to. Not alot, but about 4 or 5. No.2, I think the rappers could have done a little better with rhyming. Their rhymes weren't satisfying. Actually they were like something a rookie could talk about. You know, I'm thinking about going out solo as a rapper-everybody says I can flow and my rhymes are like the best. So I'm workin' on it, but back to the cd-This cd overall is awight, but like I said, there were some weak spots. Just try to listen to the whole thing through before you buy it. That's my only advice...Peace!"
2,congrats,wassup i just want to congratulate all of you for being so successful. There's not many times you see black men making it like this/ Oh! dmx that was a good move with putting sisqo on your hot new release. all big props to you.
2,RE: Overrated!!!!!,"This album it too overrated. Only two songs are hot. Two DMX joints are decent. The rest are not there. Swizz beats is overrated as well. The Jay Z solo track is horrible, Eve and Drag-on are wack to def. and those ruff ryder cats are not good at all. The only people saved this album are The LOX and Big Pun. DMX did okay but just okay. Sheek is a slept on mc and needs some more appearances on the mic. Same thing for Jadakiss and Styles. Overall, the album needs work because it is nervous."
5,"i am represnting queens, newyork","this complication album for volume 1 was hot because every song on this album was good including the song from jay-z ""jigga my nigga"", and ""dope money"" featuring styles and jadakissi of the lox that why the album went platium."
3,Why Is This Nominated the Best Album of the year?,"Again, i have had this album for months now, There are about 3 good songs that are great for mix tapes. It was a good idea to release a CD with numerous upcoming artists, but this was apoor showing of it in my opinion.Even the DMX songs were not his best effort. Most of the rhymes are typical. Ryde or Die is a good song the represents the entire ruff ryder crew, and eve's track shows she has huge potential. This is one of the only songs on the CD with a good beat as well."
3,This was a mediocre C.D,Some of the cuts on the album were ok like Some X S*** and Jay-Z's cut but the rest of the cd lacked the same thing that DMX's old c.d.s have
2,It Had Its Moments,"This album had its moments: the self-aggrandizing of Jay-Z on ""Jigga My Ninja""; the provocative call of Eve on ""What Ya Want""; and......that's about it. Let's just say that the rest of the album wasn't as memorable. Would I recommend you buying it? The answer is no. Wait for the singles to come out or borrow it from a friend--- like I did ;-)"
3,"It's a decent c.d., but don't expect anything classic.","When you first buy this c.d. after listening to tracks 1-4 you may believe that you've run upon a a hip-hop classic. On the contrary, after track number 4 this c.d gets really dull. There are maybe 2-3 songs after #1-4 that may keep true heads somewhat interested, but that's it. When looking over the artists on the c.d. this is a big disappointment. On the other hand, this c.d. may just be worth buying for the first four songs. They are all very good. But don't expect anything too catchy after that."
4,Ryde or Die Baby,"I owned this cd about 10 years ago; and haven't heard any of the tracks since... truthfully, it is just as amazing as it was then.All of the Ruff Ryders seem to just ""Ryde"" so well together... their beats, flows... you name it. IMO, there are only a few tracks out of the 15 on this album that are not great; however, they are not terrible... in fact, even pretty good.I haven't heard much of the other volumes from the Ruff Ryders (Ryde or Die); but from what I have... it seems as if this cd blows the rest away.So get at it!"
2,This CD didnt live up to all the hype.,"ALL I KEPT HEARING WAS HOW TIGHT THIS CD WAS GOING TO BE,BOY WAS I DISSAPOINTED. SWIZZ BEATZ, WHO EVERYONE SAID WAS GONNA DROP SOME PHAT BEATS DIDNT DO IT. I GIVE HIM CREDIT FOR DOWN BOTTOM, PLATINUM PLUS, AND X-SHIT. THE REST I COULD PRODUCE MYSELF. BOTTOM LINE NEVER LET THE ARTISTS THAT YOU FEATURE OUT-RAP YOU IN YOUR OWN CD. MY ADVICE, UNLESS YOU ARE A FOLLOWER, DONT GET IT."
5,Yo the whole piece is good money!,Yo I liked this one. My personal favorite was that one by my man Jigga. This a must have in yo collection if you a real hip hop head. Ruff Ryders did it on this one.
3,a 7 not as butter as publicized,"Really ya the jigga and the last cut are hot. Every song with EVE in it is also butter. Its not bad at all ,but all the publisity made seem a lil better. IN a scale of 1-10 it is a 7."
1,Only tha LOX keep this album live,The only ones with skills in the Rough Ryder camp are the Lox. DMX and Drag-on are the worst. That chick is tolerable.
5,DMX DMX DMX DMX:Will we ever get enough of the prodigy?,"Never will he be surpassed, never will there ever be another as true to the game as this fine man. Dmx, the greatest ever and ever will be. I cannot express in words the sentiment I have for this man. Its extremely rare a person of this calliber is heard, loved, and understood. People, all I would like to say is....ARF ARF ARF ARF GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR....... One love to bandit,bobbie, and boomer: Earl, I love you man: Keep up the sublime rhymes"
4,a good summer album,this albumhas stong potential for heavy summerrotationeve is a verrrryyy potent artist
3,It's not da bomb!,"You know i throught it was going to be the bomb, it's not. Don't get me wrong it's good, but not like you would think."
4,This CD is overall great but...,This CD is absolutely great except it is too short. It leaves you coming back asking for more. Most of the songs are very good and have most of your favorite artists.
3,A great compilation of new and current artists,The first half of this album takes of like a rocket. There are an array of tight tracks and lyrical wizardry. However the second half tapers off and is carried by the early tracks. It is still a winner so don't sleep.
2,"2 stars for respect of Eve, DMX and Drag","if Drag is even on tha damn album. im so sick of this ruff rydin shlt. DMX proved his talent wit his first album, and Eve wit both of hers, and Drag-On's album was terrible but i know he got it in him kuz he makes tha compilation songs great. but this cd i give it two stars for the first song on here after that it all downhill, and on #7 im pretty sure they dissin God, and if u dissin God u dissin his followerz, that mean me, so i gave this already burnt cd the hell away, dont bother buyin it, go buy some real rap like Talib Kweli or Wu Tang clan or even if u like ruff ryders buy Eve or DMXs first album."
4,Great not excellent,"This album has some of my favorite rappers. EVE and Jay-Z being my favorites. I also like DMX even though I don't like him as much as Jigga. but Vol. 3(on Jay-Z, not Ruff Ryders) didn't need Jigga my Nigga on as a bonus track. Also, DMX was meant to be on this compilation. But it's not quite Fugees. Big Pun also got a track on this. Despite some redundant beats, this could actually be perfect.And to that person, why would an alterna-punk/rock band be on tour with some gangsta rappers? I confess i do listen to it (I will listen to almost any genre) but there's sometimes exceptions. This is not one. But this is not completely essential. But EVE (not Eve6) was one of my favorite newcomers at the time and she should soon be coming out with another album."
3,Down Bottom,The only good song on the cd was DOWN BOTTOM and 'jigga' and what yall want' got played out by being on the radio so much but DOWN BOTTOM is still a tight song to be bassin at a party YA DIG?
5,Ruff Ryders 4 life,Ruff Ryders till i die son. This cd is pack with joints that will even make your moma say hit me again and put some stank on it. Ruff Ryders for ever!
5,great cd and i hope there are more too come,this cd has just great rap from people like dmx lox big pun juvenile jay-z mase jermaine dupri and the rest off the ruff ryder crew its a must have.
3,RIDE OR DIE?RAP OR RHYMN,"THE ALBUM WAS ALRIGHT,WELL IT START OUT TIGHT AND JUST SUNK FROM THERE.THE FIRST FOUR SONGS ARE TIGHT,BUT THE OTHERS ARE A QUESTION MARK."
1,Pass this one over,There are only two decent songs on the album. I burned it off of a friend because it isn't worth buying.
2,Not The Greatest!!,I am personally dissapointed to admit to my friends that I actually purchased this cd. I am a big fan of DMX and the entire Ruff Ryder team but this cd is just flat out horrible. My only question is why is Jay-Z(Roc-A-Fella) on this compilation cd. That in my opinion is the worst part of this cd.
2,1 or 2 highlights but mostly filler,"This album is basically just a resume of Swizz Beats' production skills. The album isn't the best of year, it's just an album. The only two songs that shine are Eve's ""What Ya Want"" and Jay-Z's ""Jigga My Nuh."" Other than that, the album's a waste of time and money."
5,It WAZ DA SH*T,YO THAT CD WAZ HOT AND DMX I LOVE THAT N*GGAZ VOICE AND JIGGA SINCE I'M FROM BROOKLYN BIG UP'S ON JIGGA. THE WHOLE ALBUM WAZ ALL DAT YO. I LOVE DMX AND JIGGA DA BEST AND DRAG -ON YA HERD BEDSTUY DO OR DIE
4,A new hip hop sound with bomb lyricism!!!,"Some of these cats giving a review on this album should go back and let thier eardrums dig what is being done here. Swizz Beatz is one of the hottest producers out there right now. He blesses every track with his signature sound without any sampling which is utterly incredible. Some of the rappers lyrics fall short of the production at times but all in all, this a great album. Check out tracks 6 and 9. The album also features production from DJ Clue. An awesome pick."
1,"Man, don't listen to the editorial reviews...","...Just like always, I'm just being real with you all: thisalbum is and will always be garbage. None of the songs on here aregood, and neither are any of the Bluff Ryder artists. The Lox is weak, DMX doesn't make any sense, Eve thinks she's all that when all of you GUYS know she ain't, Drag-On just BRAGS-ON, and everyone else I forgot to mention from that wack crew, GOOD. Man, just take my advice, skip this at the record store...it ain't worth sitting there and getting pissed off about. Once again, I'm just being real with you guys."
4,"This is a cool album but, some of the beatz got to go.","""Ryde or Die"" Vol. 1, is dope as hell, but the producer could have done a better job of providing some of the premiere rappers with better beats and musical background. One example is track number 16, with Big Pun, come on fella's wuz up. But even though all the tracks weren't tight as I expected, it was still off the chain, and I'm waiting on vol.2, and 3, etc.. By the way I'd like to give a shout out to all the playa's and business men who put this record together, especially my inspiration at important times DMX, peace and love Ruff Ryders. Ya'll number one fan, keepin' it real. L.D.B. aka ""K-Breeze"""
2,Not as good as you think.,Dont buy this CD if your just a DMX fan cuz hes only on three songs. Some of the songs are just wack and and really not worth buying. If you have a friend that has this CD just borrow it from them but dont buy it.
3,"dont buy it, borrow it","not worth my money, jadakiss and dmx have a couple of decent songs but they arent as good as any of the songs either of dmxs albums."
1,HORRIBLE WORST CD EVER,this is the worst cd i have ever heard they have inapropriate langugae such as jigga my... all these rappers do is curse to horrible background music they brag about how cool they are because they have done many inapropriate things jeez what is the world coming to this is a horrible cde with horrible lyrics beats and many other horrible things
3,Aight,"JIGGA,AND EVE DID WHAT THEY HAD TO DO,BUT THE LOX WERE A LIL WEAK,AND COULD HAD SOME BETTER RHYMES"
1,NOTHING NEW FROM DA DMX CREW,DR. SEUSS RHYMES WITH REDUNDANT BEATZ...NO DOUBT THAT THIS WACK $#!+ WOULD BLOW UP. THE EVE JOINT IS ALRIGHT PARTY SONG. THE REST IZ GARBAGE.
3,"It could have been much,much,much better!","It wasn't raw enough.But Eve and Jay-Z handled they business.It could have been much,much,much better."
2,DMX was the only reason I picked it up,"This album definitely wasnt worth the $ i paid for it. The only good tracks are the ones that have the guest appearances on them (i.e. JD, Mase, Big Pun, Jay-Z, etc.) All these Ruff Ryders trying to be like No Limit arent even as good as Master P's soldiers. Besides Swizz Beats isnt that good of a producer. By it if you've got nothing else to spend your hard-earned money on."
5,"Very hot, worth the price","Ryde or Die Vol 1 is the best album I have ever herd. There are songs on there that people will be playing in 2009.There are two reasons why you should pick the ruff ryders album. One reason is the song by Drag-on and Juvenile called ""Down Bottom"". Drag-on flows on that song was real tight, and Juvenile flows were alright. But the thing that made me like the song was the hook and the beat. And another reason you should by this album is Jadakiss song called ""Kiss of Deeath"". On that song Jadakiss really put it down. It makes me wont to go buy the next LOX album even though there last one was real wack. So if you have a little money go pick up Ruff Ryders album it is of the hook. peace."
2,It Doesn't live up to the Hype,"This CD wasn't as good as i expected. I love rap , and my favorite song was the Ruffryders anthem , So i got the Cd thinking it would be good (especially since t was number one on the Billboard charts).But , i only like about three of the songs.Instead get something like Snoop, Nas or Krayzie Bone."
4,Great Product a little hard to clean if you don't do it right away.,While it is difficult to clean I actually have found it easiest to have a dish full of water and then wipe down all of the parts when it has cooled down enough.I have been making soy milk for almost a year.Last week I made 4 batches in 1 day so that I can use it in macaroni and cheese. If I soak it at least 8 hours and only fill it around 2/3rds full I haven't had any problems with it not grinding fully. I can get 48 oz of soy milk with only 85-100 grams of soybeans.
3,not so good one from my point of view,Ordered one since I found previous reviews are so good. But actually this machine is just so so compared with the one I used before. I will put more details later..
3,Thorough Yet One Dimensional,"The chapters of this publication are intently focused, it seems, on downplaying the role of a greater Chaco community across the San Juan Basin. Intra-valley development is the mantra of this volume. While there is no question that local development is significant an attempt at exploring the mechanics of interaction with neigboring groups, much less with a central canyon, is generally ignored. This creates a one-dimensional approach leading the reader to believe that people living within the basin were culturally confined, locally. The last chapter of this volume, which is authored by Steve Lekson is alone worth the price of the publication. Lekson is allowed to ""Think Great"" and encourages a broader view of the San Juan Basin, beyond local and regional boundaries."
5,this is for all you who cant get enough of that true school,"'they said it was all glitz.. i exhale, this sh*t is stale, old bidis are like new hip hop..' this album along with EVERY other PUTS release is as fresh as it gets for old school/true school.PUTS are one of the only still following the 'all break beat/no key board no drum pack' style hip hop.. as in every sound you hear is literally another piece of another song somewhere else in time. all this new industry made hip hop is horrible. if youre looking for relief from today's 'hip hop' b**ch-made music its time for you to turn to the people under the stairs.. and id suggest you start with next step. thats an album with alot of funky breaks,really fat beats and the freshest of lyrics. reminds me alot of tribe called quest back in the day. its a gem."
3,classic puts,"This is a must have for any true PUTS fan! Highlights of this cd include the tracks, San Francisco Knights, Wannabes, Time to Rock Our Shi*, and Los Angeles Daze!!"
5,Outstanding,"This LP is 100% pure hip-hop at its finest. PUtS really broke ground when they came out with this, their first full length album. They fill a large niche that's been void for quite some time now in the west coast hip-hop scene. The classic sample heavy looped beats and carefree rhymes will impress anyone looking for the real thing."
5,THE BEST STEP,This album is so good. It is even better than ? in the form of an answer. The beats are incredible. This record is in the top five of my 200+ hip-hop album collection.
1,Zzzzzzzzzzzzz & What's up with all the 'easing'?,"Actually, I rather like Modesitt, despite his peculiarly wooden writing style, but I found this book so dull that I found myself counting the number of times his characters 'eased' into, up to, and around things, rather than paying attention to the plot (which, two months afterward, I have absolutely no recollection of). You may ask, why did I continue reading it, in that case? I ask myself the same thing. I kept waiting for it to get interesting, I guess. But I suppose it's difficult to ""ease"" into excitement-mode."
3,Slow pace - little action,I found this novel very slow moving and having very little action. The space battles are short and not very detailed. The overall plot is a strung out mystery of government agencies and cover-ups.
1,Disappointment,"L.E. Modesitt has been my favorite author of fantasy novels. I have enjoyed reading the entire Recluce series and the Corean Chronicles, but the Ethos Effect was a major disappointment. The novel projects all the current race, religion, sexuality, and family value conflicts into the far distant future. It is a very gloomy view of the future."
5,So THIS is poetry.,"As someone who doesn't really like or ""get"" poetry in general, I found Leza Lowitz's //Old Ways to Fold/New Paper/// to be a revelation. The poems have a tremendous power that seems to have to do mainly with the poet's voice--there is something about the rhythm of the lines and the honesty of the sentiments that makes it seem as if the words are emerging straight from the unconscious. Pictures are painted in my mind that make me feel as if I'm actually experiencing what the poet describes. I find myself thinking, ""so THIS is poetry,"" and taking the time to read other contemporary poets--but without really finding, as yet, anyone else who conveys that quality to me. I will keep trying, however, and hope to see more of Ms. Lowitz's work in the future--she may make a poetry lover out of me yet."
5,ACUPUNCTURE OF THE HEART,"With fine, deft strokes, renowned poet-translator Leza Lowitz skewers her topics, either stimulating or anaesthetizing. Ranging the world of her own travels and psyche, she has the gift of a good poet to irritate when she pricks our sacred cows, to alarm when she rings the warning bell, and to arouse our humane sympathy when she draws near to our common causes."
5,Awesome compilation...please make more!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"WOW....I just love this great compilation. But, it does remind me of a CD I bought back in 1995. Anyway, since I'm an idiot completist, I have to have everything this band does because they care so much about their fans. And what a better way to spend my hard earned money on this superlative compilation. I was just thinking that I needed another CD with Dust in the Wind. Please Kansas...I beg you....Make more of these awesome compilations!!!!! I just love them..What integrity!!!! Make sure to put Dust in the Wind on your next compilation. It will be a Cold Grey Morning in hell when they release an album of new material...sad...sad..sad"
4,Great,"Now I have mixed feelings about this album. One the one hand I'd rather loose a digit than have Juanita taken away from me. On the other I don't find much to like about the rest of the tracks here.Juanita is indeed the perfect trance track. Amazing highs and lows. A great building track. And when that fast electronic blipping scale is introduced in the background near the beginning you can't help but fly. You really are in a trance at the end of its seventeen minute run time.Next up comes Sappy's curry which again has a nice fifteen minute length. Enabling the listener to fully be enveloped in its subtly changing melody.I also enjoy Stagger which is quite different from the others. A slower, introspective track which only introduces a beat near its end.Unfortunately I didn't find the remaining nearly as interesting as the above. Which is not a problem as the three I've mentioned are some of the best ( and completely unique ) electronic tunes I've ever heard."
5,Resonator...Resonator...Resonator,"Bold. Powerful. Poetic. Such are the terms one has to use when describing the fiercely original music Underworld creates. Each track is like a short story packed with elegant electronic, vocal and (sometimes) guitar expressions. As a whole, these elements come together in a symphony of driving beats, beautiful arpeggiated keyboard lines and Karl Hyde's haunting vocals.Underworld cannot be classified musically. They are way too good for that. They create sophisticated music, and they do it extremely well. Masters of texturing and layering one original keyboard, drum or vocal part after another, Underworld crafts music at a level very few will even dream to reach."
5,Dark Side,"If you are looking for the Dark Side of the Moon of the 90s, there were two. This, and a certain album by Radiohead. The creativity, innovation and blazing originality of Underworld was never better represented in the studio than on this disc. I experienced Underworld live in NYC in the late 90s, on a whim when a friend suggested that I go the day of. That show single-handedly resurrected my love for alternative music. So I bought this after. An absolute masterpiece, one of the best albums of the past 20 years. Unless you're a moron, the first track will blow you away, it builds, changes and all the while chills you like nothing else out there. Then you are ready for the rest of the disc, a genre in and of itself."
5,The Double Disc Version,"This is the 2-cd version of Second Toughest. I won't review the main album, as it has been done quite well by other. The bonus disc has only 2 songs: the full 11:40 version of Born Slippy (Nuxx) and Rez. True, these can both be found elsewhere (Rez on the 1992-2002 compilation and this version of Nuxx can be found on the 1996 reissue single), but if you can find this at a reasonable price, it makes for a nice collector's item."
3,Good ambient/slower techno,"Though you'd be hard pressed to find a catchy dance tune on this entire CD, the songs make for good ""wandering thought"". The music is not ethereal (buy Enya [but she's not techno]), but it does have hypnotic qualities. The mood of the CD is dark and disconnected."
3,Mediocre,"Pearls Girl is the only gem in this album, and can be considered the prequel breakbeat version of Born Slippy and a much stronger track. Other tracks are throwaways not really worth noting, Karl Hydes vocals are best distorted (Born Slippy style). Pearls Girls intricate drum programming carves it own place in great jungle/breakbeat/big beat tracks and is the only reason worth owning it. For more Born Slippiness, check out the Darren Price rmx, a brilliant take on the original (not on this album)"
1,What is the big deal about these guys?,"You want to own something by underworld, get their born slippy single. It has the song itself and many of its remixes. That song is terrific. The same can not be said about this CD. Track 5 is OK but nothing special. Music on this Cd just got on my nerves. Much too often it seemed boring and annoying. Again, some nice moments but I wouldn't recommend it. Some melody would've gone a long way."
4,"Great, but needs to be REMASTERED!!","An excellent disc, but one that is in dire need of a proper remaster to do it justice. The sound quality on this CD (which has been out for more than 15 years) sounds thin, because the technology was not available at the time to create the full, rich sound that is now standard.If anyone is reading this who knows someone who knows someone who can get someone to get the job done, please, pass this message along: a REMASTERED version of this disc is URGENTLY NEEDED!!! (and while you're at it, the rest of the Underworld catalog too!)"
4,Sophmoric Goodness,"Second toughest is my least favorite Underworld CD. But I still gave it four stars. Yes, he's that frickin' good."
4,Dream to it,"Last night I put this CD on for the first time ever before going sleep. Ever notice that listening to some trance/electronica music will put pretty tripped out and sometimes unpleasant thoughts and noises into your head and often make you think someone/thing is in your apartment while you're sleeping? On the contrary, 'Infants' soothed my tired soul. I bought this CD based on reviews on Amazon, and it was well worth my while. I had never even heard of Underworld prior. It's just beautiful, and if it weren't for the many others on my long list of desired albums, I would purchase every one of Underworld's pronto."
5,Just get this CD!,"I don't have to say much, this album is their best and from the very start 'Juanita' will take you through some great sounds, particulary the excellent 'Pearl's Girl.'This album highlights the height of the underground dance scene in 1996, before this group and many others went wildly commercial."
4,Mosquitoes,"This album totally took me by suprise. I had no idea the first song was 16 minutes long cause it flowed so easily, making changes every five minutes of so. Then all of a sudden, ""Banstyle"" starts up as a drum & bass song and slowly becomes a more downtempo ambient chill tune. Weird indeed. This I think is Underworld's most experimental album. ""Rowla"" is techno-heavy to say the least. Just one riff, tweaked to death and then tweaked again. ""Pearls Girl"" also has some of the greatest lyrics to any song, ever. Grab the Import, which has ""Born Slippy"" and ""Rez"" as added additions."
2,The Reason Journalists Shouldn't Write History,"Kaplan tries to sustain his ""theme"" of America as the new imperial power with extremely superficial references to Roman history, a subject he obviously does not understand. A whole book based on the typical journalistic technique of taking a single observation and implying that it represents a much greater whole. Some interesting bits, but full of unsubtantiated ""facts"" For example, Kaplan accepts taht Yemen is ""estimated to have"" 80 million small arms for a country of 20 million (love the use of passive voice.) No human being has any idea how many Yemenis there are, much less how many guns are in the country. Shouldn't Kaplan have simply asked how anyone could possibly know this? Respectful, generally, of the military men he met, but a very thin piece of work."
1,To all the thin skinned one star woosies,"No, the book isn't perfect, nor are Kaplans views on geopolitics and the military. Obviously you morons only like books that espouse your personal viewpoints. I have served in a majority of these places with the Marines, Navy, Army and SF. He relates the stories well; at least they seem not to be self agrandizement or inflated. It seems to me most of the negative comments are comming from the I got an ax to grind liberal left.Actually it is one of the better books on current military ops by a journalist out there. Just take what he says and draw your own conclusions you thin skinned know it all whiners. 'Nough Said. 3 STARS.USMC 85-93USN 02-11"
2,Silly and a bit sad,"Early in the book I stumbled on this sentance: ""I was starting to love these guys."" This sums up the mood of the book, Kaplans simplistic adulation of the Special Forces. As the book grinds on, for it is long, this gets quite boring; much better are Kaplan's descriptions of the situation in Columbia, Mongolia, Yemen and the Phillipines. Kaplan's Balkan Ghosts was a real five star book, here he gets himself enmeshed in very strange ideologies - sometimes even bordering on facism. I also think that in many ways his analysis is wrong, in many instances the beaurocratic/humanitarian methods of the EU seem to work as well. I suppose a man like Kaplan who believes that the world is headed for total chaos wouldn't subscribe to that.So, in many ways a silly book - I have the impression of a bookish type wanting to be one with a bunch of macho, budweiser drinking soldier types."
4,we're imperialistic?,"As a military officer, this title immediately caught my interest when I saw it on a bookshelf - America's not an imperialist nation, is it? This book provides a very interesting perspective that is very useful for any military officer to read.A military history buff may not find this too great because, while he briefly describes the background of each country, it's really more of a snapshot of US military activities in the first decade of the 21st century. Kaplan does a good job providing a brief history of the country being highlighted in the chapter, describing the current condition, and sharing his experiences traveling through them with various military members.The result is a mosaic of military combat action and diplomacy; large unit operations, special operations action, and defense attache experiences. Very helpful in building a much better understanding of American military engagement currently going on across the globe."
4,How we'll prevail--someday,"Excellent, excellent book, readable and informative; shows how, despite the current criminal mismanagement of its personnel and resources, the military can and will play a crucial role in future international endeavors."
3,Insightful Opinion,"If your looking for a first hand interpretation of what life in Special Forces is like, then this is the book for you.The author gives us his account of several years traveling the globe observing SF units and it paints a very vivid picture. My only regret is that his inference and implication of how he defines so called American Imperialism is less than academic. Regrettably, this author relies on opinion and asks the reader to accept, carte blanche, without debate, his definition of imperialism.On a side bar, the book offers great insight into what the future of military transformation should like.lastly, you may be disappointed in how the book ends. I felt that the author did not do an adequate job of bringing closure and concluding his work.Terry Tucker, Doctrine Developer/Staff Mentor to the Afghan National Army"
3,Are we really an empire ?,"A central thesis of Kaplan's book is that the U.S. is now an empire with global reach. I just don't agree with his premise. If we are an empire, we're pretty bad at it. What is true is that the U.S. military has succumbed to ""mission creep"" with little or no public debate. Why are we training troops in places like Chad or Algeria ? Kaplan is fulsome in his praise of the ground-level troopers, and they deserve it for their dedication and resourcefulness. But it must be admitted that these qualities are often put to use in the service of missions of dubious strategic value."
4,Mostly riding along with soldiers,"Kaplan has a very good hypothesis in terms of how America needs to use it's military power in the world today.His book then goes on to chronicle his travelling with soldiers in various spots around the globe. And the travels are very interesting.But I wish he would have also gone more in to the big picture, and how these pieces fit in to that big picture. I would classify this book as more on the scene newspaper reporting than the world in context.I'm glad I read it and it is a compelling read. But it's also just individual data points rather than big picture."
2,Not a true large sized condom,"I bought these looking for more sensation and comfort compared to Magnum thin condoms. What I do like about them is the lack of latex odor, but these simply did not fit like magnums or any other large sized condom I have tried. They may be slightly longer, but these will not work if you are thick, they are just too tight. I had high hopes with the reviews these have been getting, but not right for me."
5,When you need safety,This is a pretty good comdom. It feels better and fits the bigger guy a little better. I would say give this a try if your regular brand is not cutting it for you. I think every guy is different so give it a shot. I think they are bigger than normal some guys are saying different but they are bigger and stretch pretty good.
4,"Nice, but be careful","I started to use the Kimono regular size a few months back when my girlfriend bought them for me. Prior to that I had used the large Trojans for many years. I noticed two things right away; first, the regular size was extremely tight and second they were much thinner than the large Trojans. I like to compare the difference between the two as having been using a Mack truck tire and then switching to Saran wrap--it really is that different.However, because the regular size Kimono was too tight I didn't put it on properly and had my first broke condom, ever. Having used the large thick Trojans for so long i didn't even know it was possible to break a condom. Well it is and I learned my lesson. I find that the large Kimono is still too tight (but not like a tourniquet, like the regular size) but I don't think it is so tight that it will impair my ability to put it on.Oh yeah, this seller sends them in a plastic baggie which I find a little strange."
4,A good reading for novice and intermediate mobile developer,Examples in this book are just great. I have built my own application based on a couple of them. It really have helped me and guided me through step by step. Now I know how to do it on my own.Thanks guys.
5,"Cocoa,The Horse Who Wanted Real Shoes","I knew someone who really wanted this book, and was really glad that I was able to find it for her."
5,A Blast from MY Past.....,"I LOVED this album when I was a kid....actually I was madly in love with John Keane and actually had the pleasure of meeting him at one of their concerts at a dinner theater in the 70's. John & I were the same age and I was a huge fan of the Keane Bros show. I wore out, and I mean, wore out, 2 copies of this album growing up and sadly the 3rd copy and last that I had was destroyed in a flood a year ago....God Loves Little Girls was the one that set my heart fluttering.....I am going to buy it again on CD and will probably wear out yet another copy of it. It brings back my childhood memories and dreams!!!"
3,"wheres the first ""born to slang"" album?","i have been searchin my eyeballs for the first ""born to slang"" album and cannot find it anywhere. i even live in nashville where he is from and dont nobody have his first album which was also titled ""born to slang"". if there is any record store that might receive this review and has this ""first"" album please email me back. i will spend 20 bucks on this cd.thank you chris"
4,KOEHLER METHOD AGAIN CONSISTENT AND EFFECTIVE,"Utility obedience is very challenging and Koehler offers consistent and effective methods to train difficult excercises. His emphasis is on clearly communicating with your dog. His methods generally get through to the dog very quickly. By the time you have reached this level (Having first read The Koehler Method, and Open Obedience Training), you should understand that his methods, while firm and authoritative, are not cruel. You will appreciate a fine completion to the obedince series. Although out of print, it is definitely worth finding."
3,OK toy for the price,I bought this toy for my 7 yr old son for Xmas. He wasn't very interested in it. Actually his older brother (10) put it together then my 7 yr old put it away. He hasn't looked at it since. The product was OK though; it's just that it didn't take very long to put together then once it was together he just wasn't interested in it.
5,WOW,"This is going to be SOOO great. Another V.C. Andrews book. But this time instead of Melody's daughter, we get Laura. Finally, they are breaking that 3 books the main character then the duaghter and finally the mother or grandmother. But I only wonder if they are going to end Melody's story."
4,Good read,"I thought the first part was ok. But in the middle, when the author goes on about Robert and Laura's relationship and Cary's jealousy, it just seems a little too boring. It seems to drag on and on before Laura and Robert have their accident. Is it just me, or does anyone else see a hint of incest here? The way Cary thinks and feels about his twin sister just doesn't seem right. I know he really loves and cares about her, and that's ok. But sometimes I get the feeling Cary would rather be her boyfriend than Robert."
4,VC Andrews,"I bought these selections for my stepdaughter, who can't seem to put them down. A very smart purchase for me because I had no idea how much she enjoyed reading until now."
2,Boring!!!!,"I think this is the WORSE book of the Logans Series,no,probably the WORSE of V.C.ANDREWS'books,don't you agree?"
2,It was ok,I was not drawn in to this book as I was with the others.I didn`t see where it told anything about Melody which who is the main person in the{LOGAN SERIES}.
2,Too slow!!,"I have read all of VC's books and really look forward to reading the next one. This one was not too terribly interesting once you got half way through. I was expecting more about the other family members, not just Laura. Here's hoping the Andrews foundation is not faltering!"
2,a disappointment,"as a longtime fan of vc andrews, i have read all of her books so far. i read this book in less than one day, and although it kept me turning the pages, i just felt as if the usual ""magic"" of this author was missing. dont waste your time with it."
2,It was a big letdown,This new book was a big letdown. I was very disappointed. Also usually there are five books per series (with the exception of My sweet audrina) and I would like to know if there will be a fifth book? It doesn't seem fair that the first three books in this series revolved around Melody and then the fourth jumped to Laura. What was the writer thinking.............
1,JUNK,"I HAVE READ EVERY ON OF V.C. ANDREWS BOOKS AND LOVED THEM ALL...UNTILL I READ THIS ONE. IT IS THE VERY FIRST BOOK THAT I DIDNT READ ALL THE WAY THROUGH I THOUGHT IT WAS JUNK AND I HOPE THE FUTURE BOOKS ACTUALLY HAVE A PLOT. I AM VERY GLAD THAT I READ V.C.'S OTHER NOVELS FIRST BECAUSE IF THIS SERIES WAS MY FIRST EXPERIENCE, I WOULD SERIOUSLY BE WONDERING HOW ANY OF THOSE BOOKS WERE SOLD."
4,This book captivatd my mind and drew me closer every page.,"I have read 2 novels in this series before ""Music In The Night"", and I really loved them. This book was also well written but I was surprised to read only about Laura and NOT Melody. I thought Laura was already dead and in the past. I am not complaining because it was neat to find out more about Laura and all the weird things her Grandmother Olivia had planned. I do not normally cry while reading books, but I did. READ IT!!!!! You will love it too ;)"
4,Pretty good,"I enloyed this book, it was a tear jerker. I do miss the old VC Andrews and this was closer to her style compared yo the runaways and the new wildflowers series. i thinkthe ghost write is going towards a teenage audience with these newer thinner books. I am ordering Olivia now. I think the ghost writer should be true to the VC andrews Audience and not change the way they have lately. We love Andrews work and expect a certain amount of quality ( and Pages)overall i have enjoyed the Logan seies very much and would liketo see a book on halli, i think that would have been more relevant than laura being halli was melody's mother"
3,"Good, but confusing","When I finished Unfinished Symphony, I had to think why Olivia qould do this type of thingto her own granddaughter. My fear is that it has something to do with Laura's mother, Sara. For some odd reason I feel that Cary and Laura have different fathers. Did you notice how much Laura and Melody look alike? It'd quite odd. Maybe Olivia thought Laura had found out something truly horrifing about her identity and Olivia was afraid once Laura recovered, it would be the first thing out of her mouth. I cant wait for the next one to come out! All of the secrets will be unvieled. No, wait. Are'nt most of them already? Maybe the ghostwriter could go out of pattern and write a book about Melody and Cary's child. Why not? He's alreadt screwed up the patteren theory."
3,Hmmm. . .,"This was a good idea to break away from the usual V.C. Andrews pattern. But I found it disappointing Laura's story was not told in the full depth that Melody's story has been. The story lead up to many points, but never fully explained those points. Hopefully the writers will write another one to fill in those gaps."
4,BOOK GREAT!!!,The book is really awesome. i found it hard to put down. People who read and enjoy V.C. Andrews must read the Logan Family Series. It was a very emotional book! V.C Andrews is one of the better authors these days. READ THE SERIES! I can almost guarantee you'll like it.
5,I couldn't put this book down!,"I am usually a pretty picky reader, but this is one of the few books that caught my attention. I think I'll be reading a lot more of V.C.Andrews' books in the future. I highly reccommend this book to anyone who likes stories about real people. When I say real people, I mean people with faults and secrets, yet are still interesting and make you feel sorry for them and their problems. Go ahead! Try it!"
2,Plot development is non existent,"I have read all of the Logan series in order, I was intrigued to hear about Laura, her relationship with Cary, and what lead to her boating accident. Needless to say, this book has very little plot. Laura falls in love for the first time, her twin brother doesnt approve(because he has an almost creepy attachment to her), her grandmother doesnt approve because Robert(the boyfriend) isnt the ""right sort"". Laura has weird hang ups about sex(cause she isnt married), she and Robert are in a boating accident, Grandmother Olivia has her intituliazied.....she dies. That's IT! We never really understand WHY Olivia is the way she is(read the 5th book),or WHY Cary is obsessed with his sister, or WHY Laura has these weird sexual hang ups.I could care less about Laura and Roberts love affair. The only intresting part are the chapters on the instituion Laura ends up in.Dont waste your money on this novel- read it for free at a book store."
3,"V.C. Andrews is no longer living, these books are bad!","Ever since V.C. Andrews death in 1987, these books have lost their spunk. This series only had 4 instead of five, and I thought they were all mediocre. Whoever decided to ghost write had better put down the pen and forget it!! These books are so juvenile!!! V.C. had a style all her own and these books don't show it."
4,A break in the Pattern? I don't think so...,"As many of the fellow V.C. fans believe, this is a break in the pattern of the five book series. I disagree. There will be a fifth book. The Logan family took a different twist than the others - there were 2 pasts to tell rather than one. The story of Laura is the first. The fifth book will detail the events of Belinda & Judge Childs' affair, the birth of Hallie, Oliva's committing of her sister, the scandal of Hallie & Kenneth, and the eventual flee of Hallie & Chester. Do not fret, the rest of the story will be told. I only have one disappointment - what becomes of Melody? She is a great character & her story is never really completed. Over all, Music of the Night itself was very good, but not the best. The Dollangangers still remain my all-time favorite - written by V.C. herself."
3,Same plot again,"Again the book is taking the same route as the other series. I have been a fan for years and have read many of the series. Although I think this will be my last, it all gets old when repeating it. As a first time reader I would find this a good book, it does keep you reading to find out what happens next."
2,Great Music- Bad DVD,Dishwalla plays an outstanding sound on this dvd. The extras are great.However the live concert left me disappointed. The most incredible thing happens. The sound of the concert and the video are totally off synch in songs like counting blue cars. Especially on the guitar solo. You can see his fingers playing something totally different to what you are listening. And sometimes the drummer hits the snare and you just know what you are viewing isn`t what you are listening.Total Scam.Worst dvd i own
2,Not representative of Dishwalla quality,"I read the comments about the editing before I bought but it still didn't prepare me for how BAD the editing on it was. I swear it was edited by a junior high media class on the last day before summer break. I'd be really interested in how/why the band or their management let this one get put on the streets. Camera angles were also limited.I love Dishwalla and I did enjoy watching this DVD and some of the special features, but for the price one should expect much much more. This DVD could have been so much better."
2,Not what I Thought,"Nice Audio, nice extras, poor song list (2 less that the CD) and poor video, With a film director very very inexperienced.Nice, but not what I expected."
3,"The best music, just not the best DVD","Just like the previous reviews, this is not a perfect concert production, but for the price I was not expecting the best. Dishwalla's music is so unique that their sound will never be overplayed in my book. I just turn it up and enjoy!"
3,Must have been some deadlines on the finished product!,"After purchasing this DVD, I have to agree with some of the other reviews. The editing leaves a lot to be desired. The show is good however. There are definitely some crucial timing errors at a few points during this concert. I would imagine the band had a finish deadline date that made them have to settle for the editing done on this DVD. The extra features are fine as well as entertaining. But I have to ask, why would you end ""Give"", right before the instrumental at the last part of the song? I have the live version of this song on this same CD, and it's all there. They also left off the song ""Every Little Thing"", which is on the CD. Also a clean beautifully done acoustic version of ""Angels & Devils"", which sounds like an extra cut without the live audience, that's not on the DVD as well. Usually the DVD has more extra songs than the CD would normally have to offer. I guess not in this case!"
5,The best $10 I ever spent,"I have been a hard core Dishwalla fan for years. I just discovered this DVD on Amazon and didn't hesitate to buy it. I was a little worried because of what some of the other user reviews said, but I thought ""Hey, it's Dishwalla. It's still great music."" I'm very happy to say that I was NOT disappointed! Ok, so you can tell the camera work wasn't done by a high quality professional and I was a little bummed that two of the songs from the CD were cut. That aside, the sound is incredible, and Dishwalla puts on a fantastic show. If you're a die hard fan and appreciate their music, you won't mind the so-so camera work. Personally, in my opinion, I actually like it. It makes you feel like you were at the show. This is one that I will for sure watch over and over again."
3,WHAT THE?!?!?!,"I can't BELIEVE they didn't include Angels or Devils and Every Little Thing in this dvd!!!Guess this is better than nothing, but still..."
5,Great classic!,"This movie is a classic! While Timothy Hutton is excellent in his role as the ""Falcon"", it is Sean Penn who commands respect for his incredible ability as a young actor. ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" is a contemporary of this movie and it is fascinating to see the range of Sean Penn's abilities. (A few short years before this role, Penn was playing small parts on the TV series ""Little House on the Prarie"" -- small parts that already hinted of the iconic actor he would become.}Young actors would surely benefit from studying the career of Sean Penn. This movie is a cornerstone of his career. Compare and contrast his range in this movie with ""Fast Times"", ""I am Sam"", and ""Dead Man Walking"" to fully appreciate the brilliance of Sean Penn as an actor."
4,bronze skimmer,"great casual skimmer, comfortable, although somewhat stiff, so feels a little cheap. bronze color is cool. sizing is a touch big."
5,"Oh Yes, this cd is a must!","Any of you who appreciate good ELECTRONIC music, not just ""rave"" music will love this album. Mark Pritchard and Tom Middleton do a great job mixing up their different guises by putting up all kinds of weird snippets and noises from their Reload, Global Communications and Link projects. Great production and even better imagination make this cd a great listen no matter what mood you're in. Some dope on amazon gave this one star, claiming it was terrible 'rave' music. Whoever said it was supposed to be rave music?? And more importantly, why the hell would it WANT to be rave music??? For idiots who enjoy crap music such as Lords Of Acid shouldn't bother with a fine piece of music such as Theory Of Evolution. Only people who have taste need apply here."
1,Don't waste your time or money!,"This is the WORST yarn I have ever used in over 30 years! Not only does it catch on itself as a previous reviewer has stated, it's even a horror show to find the right places to stitch into. It becomes like fuzzy thread when crocheting with it and blocks its own visibility. I had a terrible time discerning one stitch from another and found that if I could make any progress at all, the piece began to just look like a big blob. Very frustrating!"
3,Corrections to Amazon's data,"Title is simply ""Carillon Bells of Britain"". Performers are ""Aldington, Gebruers, Leith, Stratfold, Workman"""
4,Ireland as it might have been (and possibly was).,"Delaney & Feehan's schoolboy account of Irish history often rings more true than that contained in more scholarly tomes. Their take on the treatment of Irish Catholics following the Penal Laws whereby: ""No Catholic could have anything, do anything, get anything, give anything, take anything, be anything, say anything, go anywhere, come anywhere, stay anywhere, live anywhere, or die anywhere, except out"" may strike the pernickety as somewhat exaggerated but then, if you are that pernickety, you are unlikely to buy a book which begins: ""Ireland is an island with water round the edges and land in the middle.""Read this and weep (with laughter)."
3,tight grip,"I got these for my ballerina daughter, but use them for my silly bangs as well, they are REALLY TIGHT, and will pull hair, but they do stay put!"
2,Did not work how I expected,"I was hoping that these bobby pins would have a superior hold to them. They might....if I can get them in. Every time I tried to slide one in or open it in the least so that I could get hair between it, it would twist and bend. If I did get it in at all, it would go in wrong. Pulling them out also pulls out hair. I would not buy these again."
2,Without a doubt KMFDM's worst album,"There's a few good songs on Xtort, such as Power, Inane, and Wrath, but the rest are mediocre at best. I particularly didn't care for Chris Connelly's nasal-sounding vocals. This album's a far cry from Adios, Symbols, or Angst."
1,Noise,"This is almost as terrible as rap. Do people actually consider this stuff music? Well, the Columbine killers did. Very dumb. If you like junk like Marilyn Manson, NIN, Ministry, then you'll love this."
4,"If you like the band, you'll love this album.","This is one of the better KMFDM albums. If you like the band, you'll love this album. Listen to some samples to see for yourself."
2,OK,"It looks like MGA is running out of ideas because these dolls are a rip of their original series. (where Cloe's hair was to be in braids, and came with a lot of accesories) Now theres Sleepin' Style and Sleep-Over which are the same exact thing!The doll is OK, but MGA definitely loses points for unoriginality.."
2,a couple of issues with this product,"There are two main problems I see with this product... number one, squeeze bottles of any kind are just terrible for mayo and salad dressing. Number two, miracle whip's formula has changed over the years to remove most of the fat from it. I've stopped buying miracle whip and buy the off brand 'salad dressing' for this reason, they still have full fat formulas. Just a heads up. Full fat stuff works much better for stuff like pea salads and the like. Much richer flavor."
1,"What, what?","Miracle Whip, 18-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 12) is one sweet, obnoxious product I have ever encountered. From what I hear people either loves it or hates it. I am in the latter category. Even if I was on a deserted island and this product was the only one available to accompany be that a fish freshly caught, a salad made of the abundant vegetation this island would offer, a loaf of bread that unexpectedly drifted towards the shore in a waterproof container, Miracle Whip is a resounding NO. And now the commercials try to make it look like the rebel of mayos, the one who did not played by the rules. Way too sweet to be anything other than a disastrous addition to any course served in my table. 1 Star since 0 is not available."
1,Wrong Stuff and it wasn't my fault!!,"I ordered a product called Kraft Hot & Spicy Mayo. A product I have been using for almost 5 years. I am very familiar with the title of the product and its labeling. They screen image I was showed during the order process was of the correct product. What I was sent was plain mayonnaise, and was incorrect. When I complained about it, I was told ""sorry YOU ordered the wrong item."" No other venue to correct this was offered, and I am stuck with a case of a perishable food item which I cannot use in my business. I am obviously unhappy with Amazon and the seller."
3,Not what is shown on the picture,"I just received my clamps and they are not what is being shown on the picture.First of all they're 2"" and not 3"", and second I received 3 blue, 3 green, 3 pink, and 3 purple - not red, white, and purple."
5,"Great for singing, reading and looking","The songs are great, the translations are good (they so often aren't) and the pictures are fantastic. My daughter pores over them for ages, looking for tiny cats or dogs, or babies, and we sing the songs together, or just read them."
5,"Fabulous!!!! Yes, buy the music too!!!!","My husband and I bought the book and CD to accompany it. Fabulous! The book's illustrations are rich and vibrant, with lyrics, with music, and hand signs too! Both of our daughters (3yo and 1 yo) LOVE the music and follow along with the book making the hand/body motions. It is the kind of children's music that is gentle and enjoyable to the adult ear. Great family fun!"
4,"Great with the album, not so great by itself.","I got the book and the music album together and I absolutely love them. The book makes the music a lot more meaningful-- even if you know enough Spanish to understand the music, the book is still useful to show you finger-plays and dances to go along with it. However, I wouldn't have gotten much out of the book by itself. Unless you are really good at reading music, get the album too."
3,Cute!,this was a gift that the parents liked a lot but the newborn can't understand yet. It is a help to learning as the child grows.
1,Deceiving,"I bought this for my father and he told me that when he watched it, it was not the Platters who were singing, but some band imitating them. This DVD is a waste of money."
3,okay product,daughter complained that they were kinda too thick compared to other products but that they lasted long enough that I can say they were worth the money paid
5,Great Deal - Save money!,My son plays tenor sax in the local high school band. We were paying about $10.00 more for these exact reeds at our local music store. I like to save money and this really helps. Thanks Amazon for selling great products.
4,Get It wet,"Although I found that you have to use a little extra time to get these reeds good and moist, they perform really well. I also use them for a C melody reed and also for a Xaphoon. Quite a good reed and quite versatile."
5,I like 'em...,I've tried other brands over the years...but always come back to the Rico Royal's. They just work better for me.
3,Don't be fooled by the 3 stars,"I was very disapointed in the way the internal network cards that came with this product worked in my machines. Basically, they didn't. because of the IRQ conlficts I was unable to resolve, I had to turn around and buy two more NICs (I highly recommend Netgear USB NICs, BTW). The only reason I gaive it 3 stars is because of the hub which works well and seems to be high quality. 3-Com dropped the ball on this one."
5,Awesome Anime,i am a fan of dragon age so i purchase this and a dragon age novel as well and i really love it and worth money spending.
2,"Disappointed, even if it's my own fault","I don't hate anime universally, I enjoyed the FFVII movie, but I can't stand cheap computer animation. The visuals of DA:DotS were barely tolerable (oddly, I thought it looked better with lots of action and worse when it was still frames). I stopped watching after about a half-hour because the voice acting and the writing were so bad I couldn't see myself making it through another hour. The voice actors lacked the level of quality I've come to expect from shows like Legend of Korra or Young Justice. The writing/pacing was awful, the pauses between lines of poorly written dialog drove me crazy.I'm so glad I didn't pay hardly anything for this. Luckily, I have family who are into anime (and Dragon Age), so they may appreciate this more."
4,Pleasantly surprised.,"First off, I would like to state that yes, I am a woman, and a fan of the game series. That led me to purchase this title from amazon. I had no real idea about what the film would be like, apart that it was set in the world of Dragon Age.The aninmation style was very different that what I was expecting. Every image had an almost ethereal glow. It made everything almost too pretty, but after a bit, I got used to it.The story itself could have been taken from Dragon Age Origins, and I liked that. It should fit in that well.The bad guy was pretty 2 dimensional, though, I wish we'd had at least a minute or two of backstory on how he became so hideous looking, apart from the whole ""I are a blood mage! RAR! I kill you all!"" thing.Would I recommend this to people who have not played the games? Yes. The story is easily accessible, and enjoyable."
4,Entertaining,"I saw the premiere of the English version of this at PAX East on April 7th 2012. I found it to be pretty entertaining. The story takes place between Dragon Age and Dragon Age II and the plot was good (no spoilers). I know some people didn't care for it, but I thought the voice acting and animation were just fine as well. Towards the end of the movie things get a little far fetched, but it's all in good fun, and hey, this is Dragon Age so some crazy heroics are expected. All in all the movie works because it doesn't take itself too seriously. It's funny at times, dramatic at others, and moves along at a good pace. Well worth the preorder price for sure."
3,Dragon Age Anime!,"I was really really lookin forward to this. I loved the first game, and have only briefly played the second. I really am in love with this world and I think this anime really added to it. The action could've been better, but the story was decent. And it really gave us our first look at the World of Dragon Age outside of Ferelden. We get to see some of Orlais, and even get to see the Vatican City inspired holy city. It was truly a site to behold, as well as the return of Dragons. I'd really like to see an actual anime series or something that gets to cameo or feature major players like the King and Cassandra who is the main character here, but a minor but important one in DA2 (her interrogations of the Dwarf Varric frame the narrative). So if you liked the games I suggest this film. It's beautiful to watch and the story just makes you want to go pay the game some more."
2,Crappy animations,"I did not like this movie at all.The animations were bad and the story the same.The movies conclusion or ending if you will, are OK and you will nok feel like you have any questions or that you did not get the entire story because of a cliffhanger.Give this 2 out of 5."
5,A Favorite in Any Language!,"This is a great album no matter what your language. Songs are upbeat and very catchy. I love them all, which is fortunate because these are the kind of songs that get stuck in your head and stay with you long after the music stops. You will baila baila baila all day long! Some of the songs are quite repititious-- I find this wonderful for learning the songs and the language but it does sometimes get on my husband's nerves. If you don't know Spanish I highly reccommend getting the book as well to explain the songs, but once you know what they are saying it's a great way to learn some Spanish and have fun while you're doing it."
5,"Get the songbook, too.","My two-year old loves this CD and the CD ""De Colores"". She can sing several of the songs and constantly asks ""How do you say in Spanish?"" Unless you happen to know these songs, lyrics, and the hand gestures, you should also get the accompanying songbook. This CD does not contain lyrics or info about how to do the hand gestures on these songs. The songbook has the most beautiful illustrations of any children's book, as well as the translations, and hand gestures."
5,Bilingual Household,We speak spanish at home to our children. It was hard finding music that is fun and the singers aren't mispronouncing words.Jose's CD has classic songs that I grew up with and new songs from other countries. I like that some of the songs can be acted out and have fun sounds (The firecracker song is one of my kids favorites!) My daughter will not get in the car without this CD. We have it on constant repeat!
5,wonderful!!!,Wonderful wonderful! Just buy it without any hesitations! It will help you and your child learn Spanish the fun way!! Haven't seen anything more facsinating than this! It's definitely worth your money!
5,HUGE thumbs up!!,My son absolutely goes ga ga for this CD. He has been listening to it since birth and he is 10 months now and he smiles big and starts to dance when we put it on for him. The singer is great with children and it shows. To me I get the feeling like he does it for a living and loves it not like he does it to only for the money. Its engaging and interesting way of singing seems like the person is present. Great for children to learn their spanish roots and old songs!!
4,Excellent for children who are learning Spanish,"This is an excellent way to introduce children to the Spanish language.Many of the songs are simple, catchy and easy to repeat.My 2 year old grandson loves singing and dancing to most of the songs."
2,60% of this book is an autobiography,"this is the first ""audio book"" I have purchased, and it was OK, but not excellant. There are some real interesting negotiating techniques in the book, but it seemed to me that a large part of the book is a Leigh Steinburg auto-biography."
3,Too much of an autobiography; short on lessons learned.,"I agree with another reviewer who made the same comments. I received the audiobook, promptly listened to it and...I felt nothing! As much as I admire Leigh Steinberg and what he's done for his clients, there was very little ""beef"" in this autobiography of himself purporting to be a text book about learning the power of smart negotiating. Sorry Leigh; actually I'm more sorry for myself wasting the money on this thing. I've ordered the hard cover book hoping there's more to it."
1,Too cursory to be of value,"The position Mr. Steinberg takes is laudable; however, the audio casette version concentrates on a 'folksy' style of narration that is neither deep nor instructive.The tape is filled with very long winded stories of conversations held years ago with coaches and players - primarily in football. One such description takes up approximately 12 minutes of tape time.Based on the tape, I certainly would not buy the hardcover version; but would consider a paperback version just to see if there is any similarity between the tape and the book. However, I feel some cognitive dissonance as I think Mr. Steinberg was well aware of the difference between the two media AND somewhat mis-represented the tape - which is not part of an ethics based business (especially since he hardly needs the money from the book or tape sales)."
1,provided no real insight on negotiating,Purely a means to describe his own accomplishments without offering real information on improving basic skills
4,QUALITY,Guality in the broadest sense of the term must become an obsession in every corporation throughout America.
1,No Windows 2000 Support,I paid a premium for this card and don't understand why 3-Com hasn't released Win2K drivers. What's up with that 3-Com?
1,Avoid this card!,"This card does not even deserve one star. 3Com no longer supports this card, so there are no drivers for Win 2000, etc. Avoid this card!"
3,Over rated and over pirced,"I bought this card about a month ago with the expectations of this card being the best. Well what can I say, the driver support is bad, since the card has been released no new drivers were released and still there is no support for Windows 2000. This card is over rated and over priced, one can by an Intel network card for half the price with the same performance and Intel drivers is updated frequently.."
3,darkseid,it is ok but the left ankle joint is coming apart and foot is about to come off not what i expected
3,One way,"This is one of those volumes beloved of amateurs everywhere who are no so much interested in exploring art as they are in producing drawings. If you studiously follow the instructions in this book, you will be able to produce drawings that look EXACTLY like the illustration in the book. And if you're interested in doing that, it's a fine book.But if you're intersted in seeing as an artist sees, and drawing the world as you see it, and not as Petrie sees it, you might want to look elsewhere."
1,misleading advertising,"This software can only be used on a Magellan explorest gps unit. To locate an address using this software on this unit takes about 5 minutes, if it can be found. Thus, it is nearly impossible to use this software to mark destinations or points of interest. If it could be used on a PC, you could at least scan fast enough that streets could be located. The small screen on the explorist 400 makes it impossible to scan and read street names at the same time.Magellan does not tell you that the software is so limited."
3,woodburning,Good for the beginner or someone trying this ite for the first time....adult supervision.....I usd it to decorate some plain wood and it worked great
1,Just wondering why this product cost 99$?,I would like to purchase this kit. Want to know why it's 99$? If somebody could explain the price I would appreciate it.
1,The head of this Spider man would embarrass Spider-Man himself.,"I choose this rating because the entire figure is mate of hard plastic and the head on the other hand is very thin egg shell plastic. My action figure's head was in two pieces when I opened the shipping box. Why wouldn't the ToyBiz company make the head out of rubber, like most action figures. Daaaaaaa!"
1,Incorrect Product Details,"There are two versions of this cd called Deep Learing by Kelly Howell but you wouldn't know which version you are buying because they both have the same ISB numbers and claim to be spoken free:One version has two identical tracks, and it is free from spoken words.The other version has two different tracks and claims to be free from spoken words but it is not: the first track is music with an introduction to the programme (which is unnecessary and annoying to listen to each time since the information is on the cover anyway). The second track is ambient sound.Disappointingly the producer is not helpful to tell you which version you are buying. I send them emails but they never bothered to (and Amazon sellers wouldn't know specially if they are selling it new & wrapped).One star, because you can't be sure what version the reviews are about and what version you are ordering."
4,Memory theta wave CD,"The Cd is lovely to listen to. I was surprised to be listening to the sound of waves breaking on the beach, pleasantly."
2,I do not like this CD. Not for studying but for sleeping,"This is something designed for meditation to put one to sleep. If you try and follow the directions while studying for an exam the next day, I am sure you will fail. I do like her lucid thinking(High Focus) CD but I listened to this one twice, say what it did, and realized that it was not a good method of learning new information. I feel that the lucid thinking (High Focus)CD is much better."
3,Can't Say,"I can't really say if this was effective. I was reviewing for a major exam when I started using this product. I did pass the exam so maybe it helped, then again maybe it didn't. If you aren't patient, the monotonous sounds may just bring you to sleep, but if you are willing to conduct an experiment on yourself then maybe this may help."
3,Quaint Story,I expected a much more developed and technical book. There is a great lack of engineering drawings. It is too much like a story.
3,Not his best effort,Still one of the funnist people on the circuit although this wasn't one of his best. Guess I don't care for comedy based on their childern. Just to much.
5,Awesome New Ralphie Material,"Just have to say I enjoyed this new dvd, ALL NEW material and taped in Texas (natch) from where Ralphie got his start. If you like to laugh you'll love this Ralphie special. I highly recommend it."
5,Good,I purchase this for my nephew and he is very satisfied he has not watched it yet. I will add more when he does. This came when expected and in excellent condition.
4,COMEDY DVD,"Very funny and uses his size as a crutch ,to address many things commom in todays society."
1,Disappointing,"I saw Ralphie May on last comic standing and thought he was great. This DVD only has a few good laughs. It's mostly dirty, which I wouldn't mind if the jokes were at least funny, but they're not."
2,hook line sinker,"not worth the price, I had to add my own product so it looked like it was worth $30 for a gift."
3,Not bad,"Pros: Multiple useful tips and creative ideas for the novice. Good indoor setup coverage, interesting 'workshop' concept, good quality print and layout.Cons: The same two 'Ok' models thru the entire book. Very little outdoor techniques (i.e reflectors and gear). Workshop concept has it's limitations. Many average, dull pictures. No digital coverage."
1,WAY over priced on Amazon!!,"The Method products deserve 5 stars..i just put 1 hoping this would get noticed because even with Amazons ""sale"" prices, they are STILL way over what you'd pay at Target, even with gas $$!!!I've tryed almost all the Method products..GREAT cleaners, GREAT scents! Well worth how little they cost at Target!!BTW~before you shop at Target, go to your local Goodwill store, sells TONS of NEW Target stuff...lots of times only payed $1 for these Method Cleaners!! I also buy target toys/clothing/bedding etc at Goodwill...than i shop at Target if Goodwills out."
1,Untested recipes,Untested recipes- in one even quantities suggested for making pastry were incorrect!. Makes me reluctant to try any more- feels like the seductive photos are a big con!
4,Book,I saw this book in a museum in Nashville where there was a small exhibition of some the photos from the book. When I saw the pictures were available in this book I bought a copy for myself and my father. Some of the pix are a bit graphic but that was to be expected.
5,One of maybe three or four of my all-time favorites...,"...I played this so much when it came out on vinyl in '82 that I almost got tossed out of the loft I was living in. Crazy, intelligent music -- all I've had of it the past twenty years or so, since I lost the LP, has been a crummy cassette. Now with the CD out (and with five ""new"" tracks!) I can listen to it all the time again. Glad I don't have roommates any longer!Lizzy was just amazing. She died a few months ago, but her timeless music lives on."
5,lizzy lizzy golden throat-,"I purchased this lp in 81 and it remains a favorite. there are those who could construe lizzy's vocal approach as art school pretension but I always found her hiccuping sub-poetics to be endlessly endearing-(recognizing the Rimbaudian connection may help). Instrumentally the lp is quite strong-Lizzy's vocals being the 5th element-a sort of neo/afro-carib rhythm section led by percussionist wally badarou. enjoy along with press color '79/rosa yemen'78 , however, less sure of her later work."
3,Another typical one of its type,"All of this series are ok, nothing really special. Depends on whether you compare one to what you would want, whether you compare it to similar ones."
5,fun and keeps 'em thinking,"My 5 1/2 yr old adores these videos. Each disc in the 3-disc set is jam-packed with mysteries which Huckle and his friends solve, along with your kid. Very cute, clean fun."
5,Hours of entertainment,This DVD is a collection of fun mystery stories using Richard Scarry's characters. I loved having this in the car for long trips out of town. I have a 4 year old and he really enjoyed watching the stories (and pretending he was Huckle Cat). I believe the collection is over 200 minutes in length so your child won't get burnt out on watching the same few stories over and over and over. I think this is well worth the money.
2,interesting but inaccurate,"This book has some nice descriptions of the area and gives you a starting point. But it is full of internal contradictions (e.g., 2 day trip in the description but 4 day trip in the summary) and outright errors (e.g., the phone number for White Squall is wrong throughout the book) and the information is getting outdated faster than you would think (e.g., the fellow who welcomed kayakers to tea out on the Mink Islands has moved and some marinas have new names and phone numbers). The black and white photos are disapointing, being colour originals not well reproduced in grey scale. At best, this book is less useful than talking to a local resident or outfitter. More up-to-date (and verified) information can be found on the Internet. If you know nothing about the area, this book will give you a sense of what to expect and ideas on where to go. Just double-check any facts before you go. -- They're writing another guide? Here's hoping they get a better editor this time."
3,Decent Print for the Price,The print came as described which was decent quality for the price. The artwork arrived in DIY quality and appeared to be printed on computer inkjet canvas spray mounted to mounting board. The artwork has a matte finish. The artwork was clear taped to a low quality white picture mat. I ended up taking apart the print and re-mounting it in a higher quality photo mat. The artwork looked amazing once framed in better quality materials. Perfect artwork for a pug lover however I ended up spending more money than orginally desired to meet my expectations.
5,Wonderful story!,"I'm not a writer so I'm not going to try to articulate an elegant summary of this story but I will say that I loved this book! I was so wrapped up in it, I found myself feeling highs and lows following the storyline. Such an inspirational story. Read this book!"
4,Everything I expected!,"I received my product in a timely manner and the book was just as described. The binding had a break in it, but that was addressed in the product description. I feel very happy with my purchase. Would definitely buy from this seller again!"
5,"Redeeming Love, a 5-star recommendation.","This is a beautiful love story. But there's a lot more to it than that. It's about trusting in God. Sometimes you have to let go and trust that God has a better plan than yours. Also, forgiveness is more than forgiving and being forgiven; sometimes the most difficult thing is to forgive yourself."
5,Read This,I enjoyed this book - It is not your typical love story because it is two love stories in one- The love of God for his children n His children's love for Him- The love the real love between a man and a woman- Not going to tell you everything but trust me read this you will enjoy it
5,ABSOLUTELY AMAZING,"I am an English major... needless to say I read far too much. When this book was given to me as a gift I was extremely sceptical, however, I decided to give it a try. After reading the first chapter, I literally could not put it down. I became so incredibly attached to the characters, and I couldn't turn the pages fast enough. This is by far ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I'VE EVER READ. SIMPLY AMAZING!!!! This author is astonishing and inspiring."
5,Captivating!!,"This is definitely the best book I have ever read, and I've read lots~! This book will build your faith. It is a winding river of the character of Jesus, and unlike anything I've ever read~! All my friends at work are now reading it. I will probably read this book many times over the course of my lifetime,and take something fresh away each time. Looking for my next Francine Rivers book for sure."
1,can you say unequally yoked?,Why would God choose a prostitute to be the wife of one of His own? Isn't Rivers writing about the same God that tells us not to be unequally yoked. I have loved her other writings but found this to be a disturbing book. There are other ways to get this same message across. I wish I hadn't polluted my mind with this one.
1,Redeeming Love,"How many times can you say the same thing! This book repeats itself so many times, I found myself saying, ""here we go again."""
1,Redeeming Love,NEVER RECEIVED THE PRODUCT. I wrote to the Seller NO RESPONSE TO DATE. MY CREDIT CARD NEEDS TO BE REFUNDED.THANK YOU
5,Pass it on...,"I heard about this book from a friend who said, ""I normally wouldn't read this type of book."" I believe it is classified as a romance novel. When she said that, I purchased it right away. I couldn't put it down. Since I have read it, I have purchased it for several other friends, and have told others about it who have also since read it. We have all reacted the same - touched deeply by it. Here is the email I received today from an old grade school friend I sent the book to: ""I just finished the book. I couldn't put it down. I loved it so much I didn't want it to end. I haven't had a book touch me like that in a long time, if ever. Thanks for sending it to me. I will be passing it on to my sister. This book is a MUST READ for all woman 18 and older. Can I get it in Spanish?? I have a number of people I would like to give it to in Spanish...."
5,Redeeming Love,A great book that changed my way of thinking of others. It is worth reading. I read it to my husband and we both enjoyed it.
5,"Possibly best book I""ve read","I just finished this book last week. I think the only thing I don't like about this book was the way it ended. It had a happy ending and all but this book was so good that I believe the author could have gotten a few more novels out of what happens the rest of Angels life. This is a book with Christian values and I was very skeptical when I got this book as a gift from my sister. I like romance books but not the raunchy kind and my sister kept pestering me so I finally read it and couldn't put it down--quite literally. It's a romance book in a way b/c the main character finds the best romances you can have, with your spouse and with God."
5,A book that was well worth the read,"With enthusism I can recommend this book. It held my attention to the point of finding it difficult to put down. The plot had much to recommend it, it keep me on the edge of what would occur next. Great!"
3,The Romance of Redemption,"This book came so highly recommended by those who had read it that we decided to make it our final ""summer"" read for our book club this year. While the majority of the first half of the book can hardly be described as anything but extremely disturbing, the rest of the story was in fact a pleasure to read, as Angel's redemption began to affect so many other people in the story. The ultimate resolution of her pain and abuse was triumph when she placed herself (rather reluctantly) in the hands of God, and to her amazement, he saves her not only from her personal and real demons, but uses her to also deliver others. Therein lies the true enjoyment for me: seeing such an illustration (although fiction) of how God can redeem even the most detestable and obscene of circumstances to work beauty and salvation in the lives of those who offer it up to his hands."
3,"Would definitely try her again, but...","I know there are many rave reviews about this book, but I have to be contrary. I was braced for the topic and hung on until the disclosure of her involement with her father. This, along with the absence of a meaningful conversation with her husband in the end, left me wanting. However, I've always enjoyed her talent for drawing the reader out of one chapter and into the next and wouldn't hesitate to pick up another Francine Rivers' book. I think it was just the topic that threw me."
2,Disapointed,Friends highly recommended that I read this book. I never realized what a difference in taste we have in literature. This story reminds me of those romance novels that have the beautiful women and handsome men on the cover. The story was repetitive. Ms Rivers used more detail describing her characters' looks than developing them into real people. The storekeeper and the restaurant owner were more interesting than anybody else was. But at least she kept it clean. She told us what was going on without lurid detail.
5,Redeeming Love a Great Read,I am enjoying this book very much. I have times I just can't put it down. Francine Rivers had me going to the bible and reading the account of Gomer and her ways. Thank you for a great story read.
5,Kristi,This is the BEST book book I have ever read! I was unable to put it down after starting it. Worth every penny!
5,Awesome!,"I recieved it in a very timely manner and in great condition! As for the book, it is so wonderful, God has used it to reform my mind about His mercy and grace.I love it. I have read it twice, and going on my third becuase I have yet to find another like it."
5,Redeeming Love,"I read this book in one day. It is such a wonderful story about God's love, the love between two people, and a love for other's who are struggling. This book is good even for those who don't believe in God. This is a very strong book about God's love for us, and that no matter where we are in life, God will love us no matter what."
5,A book to renew our love for our mates.,"This is the first book I have read by Francine Rivers. I am going to order this book to send to my daughter. This book is not just a beautiful love story between a man and a woman, but a love story between God and his people. This story shows how God makes things happen in his time, not in ours. I look forward to the next book by this author."
5,I loved it!,"This was a slow starter but after the first couple chapters you can't put it down, I loved it! It came fast and in great condition!"
5,"Wonderful, beautiful love story.",It is the most beautiful illustration of God's love for us. Very touching and well written.
4,Inspiring read,I looked forward to cracking this book open each day. A beautiful and inspiring love story. My only complaint is some of the language used among the characters seemed a bit watered down. Just because this is a Christian novel doesn't mean it should be watered down! I would recommend this book to others.
5,Life changing!!!!,"I found this book to be life changing, especially to those who could relate to the story/message. I couldn't put the book down as it had me from the beginning right on to the end. This is now my favourite book and could read it again (which I don't usually do). To those who feel that their life is over, that it's too late for them and that whatever they have done cannot be forgiven... you are wrong. I would recommend this book to anyone."
5,"Simply amazing, even for guys","I am a guy and was a little skeptical about reading this, mostly because of the cover and the title (my girlfriend recommended it to me). However once I got into it I could not put it down. This book is an amazing reminder of how much God loves us, how he has plans for our lives using the bad to turn to good, and finally it demonstrates the type of love a man should have for his wife. Like other people said, this should be required reading in high schools."
5,Awesome,"There was a little tear in the cover, but otherwise it was shipped on time, arrived early, and was exactly what I wanted."
5,One of the best books ever written!,"One of the ""best"" Christian Romance books I have ever read. You wouldn't even have to put it into a ""Christian Romance"" category. It literally stands on its own. Powerfully written, raw, honest and heart wrenching. It is not preachy in anyway. A really excellent book to read. I recommend this book to all your friends! No matter what they believe! Not for YA readers. Adult themes...Enjoy!"
4,Redeeming Love,"Redeeming Love is one of the most inspiring demonstrations of love, written by author Francine Rivers, who defies the myth that Christian novels are stuffy or boring. Nothing seems to be missed as Rivers defines the emotional complexities of her characters.The depth of pain, loss, regret, shame, love, passion and the joy of redemption are articulated with a skill that has your soul aching and your heart racing. You will undoubtedly find your inner yearnings expressed through one or more of her characters. You may also find a need for something you were never really cognizant of, a pure, unfailing love that is ever waiting to find its place in your heart. This is a book that I will purchase for many of my friends, both male and female...a true lesson in the healing power of love."
3,great,If you have never read this book it is a must!! Such an uplifting and beautiful book should never go unread! I strongly encourage you to read this book because it might change your outlook on a few things!!
5,A masterpiece...,"Before reading this book, I had no clue what it was. I just found it on a bookshelf and began reading it. This is the best, most moving novel I have ever read. Based on the book of the Bible, Hosea, Francine Rivers clearly portrays the meaning of TRUE love and how we should live by love and forgive others as God has done for us. This book is not only outstanding and addicting, but it teaches lessons about life and TRUE Christianity that can change you forever."
5,Amazing!,"One of the best books I have ever read! Definitely on my top 5 list. I read it about a month before I got married, and I'm so glad I did. Great perspective!"
5,REDEEMING LOVE,"GOOD CHRISTIAN FICTION,I ENJOYED READING ABOUT HOW SHE OVERCAME ADVERSITY AND FOUND A LOVE NOT ONLY IN GOD,BUT HUMAN REDEMPTION AND LOVE"
5,Redeeming love,"I love this book! It's my second time reason it and I can never stop each time I have read it. It's so powerful and brings me closer to finding my purpose in life, and makes me look at the things I need to fix in my relationships with people. Such an inspirational book and I would recommend it to anyone!"
5,Amazing,This is a must read for anyone. Underneath the perfect characterization and heart wrenching story comes a strong message if God's love and forgiveness. I learned so much from thus book. I felt like I learned so much without having to be bored to death. This book is refreshing for the Christian reader.
5,"Well-written, digs deep into the pain of a broken woman made whole","Tough preface summarizes how a little girl is sold into prostitution. And how a man is directed to marry the hardened woman she becomes. How Unconditional Love can pierce through a stone heart and gradually cause this woman to trust and live again. There are women like this all over the world, still living the nightmare. This is one story that ends happily."
5,This book is a great picture of redemption..,It can be used as a great evangelistic tool. I personally benefited from the story and learned a lot about the background of those who have lived in the envirenment of evil.
5,Beautiful,I have read this book at least five times and God speaks to me through it every single time. Absolutely beautiful.
5,Amazing read,"I read this book every year like clockwork. I cannot express how much I enjoy this book. Retelling Hosea would be a difficult task for anyone but Francine River's Redeeming Love is astonishing. It doesn't shy away from the harsh realities of prostitution but also is not graphic, it's just real. I fall for Micheal every time I read it and cry at Angel's pain.This is easily one of my favorite books. A sweeping love story and a wonderful message of love and forgivness, you will just have to read it and see if you like it too."
5,AMAZING,"This book has helped me and several of my friends hear God in a way we needed so much. It deals with so many matters of the heart concerning men and how we feel about them. Great book for someone who had a childhood with rejection from a father figure, any kind of sexual or physical abuse, and even married women who can't seem to fully give their heart away to their husband for fear he will break it. Enjoy!!"
5,enthralling,"i could not put this book down! i loved every minute of it. i am not exactly a conservative christian... more moderate, and i was very pleased with how reasonably Rivers went about this book. i seriously went through this book in two nights and gave up sleep because even though i knew what happened with Hosea and Gomer i still wanted to know what happened next in this magnetic novel!!"
3,"Good story, horrible writing","This book is a wonderful story and is a true example of God's redeeming love for us. However, Francine River's writing is atrocious and the characters in her story are less than two dimensional. New characters continued to be intertwined with no real purpose. More than once, I believed the story could have been shortened by half. In no way is this an educational novel that ""should be required reading in schools"" as one reviewer wrote. The cliches and verging unacceptable romance writing for a christian novel almost did me in. If you have some time to waste and can't find another novel better to read, go ahead and read this."
5,BEST BOOK EVER!,"Redeeming Love by Francine RIvers is the BEST book I've ever read. It will make you laugh, make you cry, and get you really thinking about things. You will start to look at people in a different light after reading this book. Reading this will also teach you quite a bit about the actual Bible."
5,An absolutely awesome book!,"Redeeming Love is my favorite book ever! Although fictional, the story of Angel and Michael Hosea is based on the book in the Bible, Hoesa. Redeeming Love is about Angel, a prostitue, whom God has told Michael Hosea to marry. Once you sart this captivating book, you will not be able to put it down!"
5,Redeeming Love,"I am like others, this book needs to have a rating of 10 stars instead of just a measly 5. I have read this book 6 times.It is so worn. I've loaned it out several more times.I make sure they return it.My husband bought me a new one and I loaned it out and never saw it again. I still have my old one but I'm afraid to open it that I might tear it, so I am buying a new one again,because I want to read it again. Yes, the one person was appalled at how blunt it was for a ""christain"" book, but sometimes even we Christians need bluntness to awaken our own shame and backslidings that God ALWAYS forgives us for.I also agree that it needs to be required reading for high schoolers.They watch enough ""R"" rated shows on TV that this would be something to show them Gods true love and forgiveness and that the many trials that teenagers are going through that He is there for them no matter what.I could go on and on about this book, but you need to read it for yourself and FEEL His love for you."
1,SORRY CHARLIE,"This book was highly recommended to me by my cousin and aunt who have both read the book twice. Unlike them; I was not as enthusiastic about this book. I was excited at the onset of reading this book, but as I dug deeper I kept losing interest. I feel like the book dragged on. It was a bit long. Over 400 pages long.I understand how much Paul despised Angel, but the author felt the need to explain this several times throughout the book.I just find it hard to believe that a man who had never spent time with a woman would be convinced that God choose her for him. I think it would be a bit more believable if she had decided to leave that life alone but she had resolved to spend her life doing what she did best.It took a lot for me to finish this book. I haven't given up on Ms. Rivers yet. I will give her one more chance. I did purchase another novel written by her, hopefully this one will fair better then the last."
3,A good book,"I read this book almost right after it came out, largely because I love Francine Rivers' books. However, I have to admit that I didn't like it as much as her other works. I liked the characters, and appreciated much of their development as people (I think Francine Rivers invents wonderful characters). However, I felt somewhat uncomfortable with the book. I generally dislike books that show a husband-wife relationship as being an analogy for our relationship with God. God has certain privileges that another human being will never have, and shouldn't have. Largely because of this, I felt more distanced from the book. I'd recommend earlier Francine Rivers novels more (esp. the Mark of the Lion series and The Scarlet Thread)."
1,"Sorry Francine, I'm disappointed!","I have read Francine River's Mark of the Lion series and it was life changing,(I highly recommend it!) so when a couple of friends suggested 'Redeeming Love', I said, ""Oh yeah!""I admit it started out interesting but when it got to the part where the ""hero"" found her, it just went on and on,with the teasing of will she or won't she give in to her hero. Also, will her hero win her? It was boring and it did not capture my interest. I found myself skipping pages to get to the good part but it never came. I can't believe that my review is so different than the others and I would really be embarrassed if I ever met Francine Rivers in person, because I know she's a real Christian! I love you Francine! I just don't like this book! I also read another book about 10 years ago and loved, loved it, and I will continue to check out other books she has written because I believe in her writing! Like I said, Mark of the Lion!!! You must read that!!"
1,Romance Novel,"I am so sorry I bought this book. I am 80% through it and I can't believe Angel is leaving Michael once again. I want to smack her. To me this is just a romance novel missing the detailed sexual descriptions. Blah Blah they love each other but she fights it; it's the same old love story. Any reference to God and Christian love - I'm not buying it like a real story of God and Christian love; unfortunately, that's why I bought it. For a real story like that read ""Rising from the Ashes"" of the Rwandan Genocide by Immaculee Ilibagiza - something I recently read; now that book blew me away."
3,Not horrible but not the best book I have read...,"This is the 1st Christian book I have read (even though I am a Christian). I liked the begining and the end but the middle of the book was SOOO slow. I was going to quite reading half way through but friends of mine encouraged me to keep reading so I didn. It turned out to be an ""ok"" book but not one that I would say is a must read.This isn't typically the type of book I read either so maybe it just wans't for me because I have heard many other people just rave about this book."
2,Disappointing read,"I read The Last Sin Eater several years ago and was delighted to find that there was another book by Francine Rivers.One thing I do not like in novels is the constant repeating of what has gone on before in the story. While I do understand that the author was trying to show what Angel's mindset was like, I found the repetition tedious.Actually, if I had understood it was a romance novel I probably would not have bought it.What did I do with this book once I was finished reading it? Threw it in the trash. My pastor's wife thought thatHavah: The Story of Eve/A Novelwas too graphic. She would not like this novel at all."
2,A Christian Harlequin Romance,"Book was in great condition, probably because nobody read it. I got it for a book club and was not at all impressed. The story could have been told in half as many pages, the characters were unbelievable. Would not recommend this book."
2,Boring and repetitive,"This author was recommended to me by my hair stylist, but I can't imagine why. I found the book to be boring, immature, and repetitive. Although it started out with an interesting premise, it soon just kept repeating the same theme over and over. I had to force myself to finish it, especially when the author decided to add Biblical teachings and it went from bad to worse. I don't recommend it."
2,Not Woth the Time or Cost,"Altho I am a devout Christian, the frequent indications that God had 'spoken' to the main characters is repetitive and annoying; the advancement of the romance between the sub-characters was SO disjointed in the literary sense and so unrealistic and out of touch with Christian mores dominent in this story, that it appears as a 'rushed filler ending' by the author. This novel was waaaaay too long and preachy.I would not read another novel by Francine Rivers."
2,I had some issues with this one....,"I could not wait to read this book since it had so many rave reviews. I usually don't read reviews in detail until after I read the book because I hate spoilers. I mainly look at the titles of the reviews and the average rating to help me decide if it is a book that I will deem worthy of my time. That said I have to say I was disappointed. I just found so many events disturbing, and most of all extremely unromantic! While reading this book, I kept hoping that Micheal would end up with Mirium! I get that everyone deserves love and forgiveness, but Sarah needed more. Sleeping with your father??? EWW...WTH is wrong with you? How is that revenge?"
5,AMAZING book.,"This is one of my all time favorite books - from start to finish.I was worried at first - because of the title and cover picture - that this was going to be some crazy romance novel. I hate romance novels, and I would never buy one. I took a change because I love Francine Rivers - and sure enough - It was awesome. I read this book a few times throughout the last 5 years, and it has stuck with me. Not many books have this type of impact."
5,A Heartwrenching Story,"I grew to love Angel and Michael, and was so disappointed when the story ended. This story, based on the Biblical Book of Hosea, caused me to think about many things, including God's continual love and grace. As always, Francine Rivers writes a powerful story."
5,Redeeming Love,When I first started reading this book I was not sure which way it was going to go. I almost put it down. I am very glad that I kept reading it. It really teaches about not judging others and being more Christ like.
5,Hard to read but worth it!,A great story! I thought the author took a lot of creative license compared to the story in the Bible. However it still had amazing character development!
2,Starts out very depressing,It is really hard to get through the beginning of this book and the middle is a little monotonous but I did like the ending.
5,A FANTASTIC BOOK!!!,I absolutely loved this book & HIGHLY recommended it to all!!! Michael Hosea's unwaivering faith & unconditional love for Angel is an incredible example of how much God loves us. This story will amaze & inspire you!
5,This book made me a fan,"I recommend this book to anyone who loves to read. It's hard to put a review for this book into words, it contains everything a good book should contain and then so much more."
5,Best Book I've ever Read!,This book is so amazing. I literally couldn't put it down and I'm NOT much of a reader. It's a great story that would be great for anyone who has experienced difficulty in life. It represents God's love and grace in a real way.
5,Beautiful Story,"I have become pretty stingy on my 5-star reviews, but this book definitely earned it. With so many reviews for this book, it's hard to add anything more. Deep rich characters combined with a compelling story, and a wonderful message of redemption, growth, and God's love... Beautiful book!"
5,"Redeeming Love, by Francine Rivers",I have read this book and have recommended it to several to read.The author does an outstanding job in writing; and its an easy flowbook to follow; it also contains a powerful message of the powerof love.I was able to purchase the book for 1/2 of what I would have spentin the bookstore; and it arrived on time for Christmas.
3,Not up to Francine River's usual standards.,"This book was definitely helpful to me in understanding God's unconditional love for me! However, towards the middle it began to read like any other romance novel. I've come to expect more from Francine Rivers. I've read most of her other books, and she's a wonderful writer! This book lacked her usual depth and seemed to me to be frivolous. To be fair, I didn't finish it because I didn't feel it was worth my time. Maybe if I'd read to the end I would have changed my view of the book. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to understand God's love better and see clearer how important it is to be faithful to Him, but don't judge Francine Rivers based on this book alone."
1,What a lot of religous crap,I am going to delete this book from my selection. Had I read the reviews I would never have bought it. Then I would have known that it was all about religious do goodies. I really hate mixing religion with romance. Instead I could have read about the good Samaritan had I wanted to. Typical American releious crap. Now I know better. So never again a book by this author.
4,Surprisingly Sweet!,"This is the first book that I have read a book by Francine Rivers and I can say I was not disappointed. The author had a way of grabbing your heart and twisting it along with Sarah (Amanda) and Michael.However, I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I had a hard time swallowing Sarah's sleeping with Paul on the wagon ride. I also found it hard to swallow how easily Michael forgave her for it and how quickly he just accepted her back in the end with no questions asked. It was Paul who went to get her. If he hadn't, she might not have ever come back.Aside from those things it was a good book that just touched your heart. I look forward to reading more of her books."
5,ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I'VE EVER READ!!,You will follow a young women from childhood into her adult life as she deals with what love had done to her. It's heart breaking and then beautiful as you watch her transformation. The authors writing style is amazing. The story seems to manifest it's self in your mind with each word read. You will read this book with every spare moment you can grab! Once you put this book down you will not be the same. This book is healing.
5,good christian fiction,I bought this book for my 16 year old daughter. She and all of her friends are reading this book. She couldn't put this book down and learned lessons from the Bible - book of Hosea. I am reading it next!
5,Wonderful Read,"This is the first Christian romance I've read. It jumped off the bookshelf and into my arms. I'm so glad for divine interventions. It's a wonderful story about a young woman who just can't accept that she can change, or that there is a God who would love her after all the sinful things she's done (and they are doozys). The story drew me in and kept me reading. I highly recommend it... It's a big read and very satisfying."
5,Redeeming Love,I thoughtly enjoyed this book. I show the bond between mother and daughter. There are somethings we remember as children as we grow with life.
5,Exceeded my expectations,"I expected a generic, cheesy romance novel and instead read an inspiring story which challenged me on multiple levels. I've now read it three times and each time something different has stood out and helped me evaluate my own wounds that need healing. I recommend this book to every woman over the age of 16."
4,"Powerful messages, but heart-wrenching","This is the first book I have read of Francine Rivers. I love to read romance novels, but had not read a christian romance novel before this one. This book has a powerful message about God's love. I feel this would be a great book for non-believers to read. This is also a good book about christian living. There are messages about living for God and waiting for His will in our lives. It is also about loving others and not being judgemental. Many of us tend to judge prostitutes, or other life situations, but we do not realize the events that lead people to live these kind of life styles. This book shows that this young girl had not choice from the very beginning. I loved this book, but is also made me feel bad at the same time. I would love to read another book by this author, but I do not want to read stories about child sexual abuse. This was an emotionally charged topic for me."
5,Unforgettable,This book definately is one of my favorites of Francine Rivers. The story based on the book of Hosea is such an awesome picture of God's love that is constantly reaching out to us to extend His immeasurable Love.Definately is written to the heart of a woman about a woman but some men may really enjoy it. This is #1 on my must read list.
4,1850s version of the Hosea story,"the subject matter could be considered questionable by some, but i highly enjoyed the book. it is also loosely based on the biblical prophet Hosea, who had a former prostitute as a wife and who kept running away. it is set in more modern times, back in the 1850s in the Old West.throughout the book, your heart just goes out to her. however, it did get repetitive as she kept leaving and fighting love, but i suppose it makes it more realistic that way since that is how people can generally be.a good read i highly recommend to anyone who wants to see more about the old west and a different description about the prophet Hosea."
4,Sweet!,"I really like this book, and have read it more than once. It's a love story based on the story of Hosea in the Bible, and has been turned into an incredibly sweet, romantic, easy read; a real comfort novel, curl up with it and nice hot cuppa if you having a bad day (c:"
5,The Greatest Love Story Ever !,"Redeeming Love is a story based on the biblical book of Hosea. The story is about a farmer named Michael Hosea, who God instructs like the Prophet Hosea to take a prostitute named Sarah for his wife. This is definitely the greatest love story ever told by any author. As always, Francine delivers right on target with her inspirational gift of writing.Redeeming Love is a story about love, faith, trust, friendship, and forgiveness. This book will not only touch your heart and soul, it will also leave you inspired and certainly a changed person. Page after page, chapter after chapter, cover to cover, this book is definitely a written art of divine inspiration.For both new and old Christian fiction readers Francine's books are definitely a must. Her book will inspire you and leave you wanting more."
1,Infuriating,"Wow, I am blown away by the almost 800 reviews, with only a tiny fraction of them one-star reviews. I gave this book to my mother-in-law before reading it, based solely on the positive reviews. She read the entire book, but mentioned it was shockingly tragic and disturbing in ways. I began reading it myself and was embarrassed that I gave it to her. Some of the images the book draws about prostitution, young girls, etc are truly upsetting. The writing style is almost unbearable and repetitive, repetitive, repetitive. I don't agree at all with the author's idea of God and how He ""talks"" to Michael. And Michael blindly listens in spite of all reason. It's simply infuriating. Angel is just dumb, dumb, dumb. I am almost finished with the book and can't wait to be done with it so I can finally move on to a better book. Awful fiction, I would not recommend this to anyone."
4,Should not be called Christian Fiction,"I was really upset by the use of God's name in vain in the first of the book. Rivers was trying to show how upset one of her characters was and used the word GD. She could have just said he cursed God, would that not have been sufficient. I always expect not to see such language when I am reading Christian Fiction. But I did go on to read the book and it was very good. The book should also make mention that this book would not be good for a young audience since it does have very mature material, which also is another reason I am not sure if it should be Christian Fiction."
3,Very good story-line but a little offensive.,"Francine Rivers proves to be an excellent writer. Characterizaton is wonderful as well as story line. I found the sexual content a little offensive. The words are not bad, but the insinuations are. I have read secular fiction books in the past with less sexual content than this christian book. The story was wonderful except for the insinuations that christians should run from."
2,Crosses the Line,"This book came across to me as a Christian's excuse to read smut. One could write a similar story full of sexual details about David and Bathsheba, but I don't think it would honor God. I realize the author was trying to portray the theme of amazing forgiveness, but it got lost for me somewhere in all the sex."
1,Not much redeeming about this book,This book was pure drudgery to read. The characters were one dimensional and the plot was so obvious it stung me between the eyes. (Michael HOSEA is the main character in a retelling of the story of Hosea? Come on! Is that the best you can do? ). This is just one example of the lack of creativity and originality of this book. Awful!
5,Picture of Christ's love for His Church,"This book accomplished several things: 1) It told a fabulous, compelling, engaging story; 2) It helped paint a picture of the way Christ loves us; and 3) It helped me understand my own marriage better and showed me how to appreciate my husband and not take life for granted.Several people seem distraught over Rivers' use of details in storytelling. Details are the mark of good storytelling, and she does not depict sex scenes graphically, so there's no need to worry. This particular edition contains a parental warning at the beginning that the book may be considered ""PG-13,"" but so are many parts of the Bible. Song of Solomon, anyone? Lot's daughters? Sodom & Gomorrah?I will insist that my daughter read this when she is a teenager, or right before marriage, along with ""A Time To Dance"" by Karen Kingsbury. I've never encountered any books -- much less novels -- that were more important for married Christians than these two."
2,Far from Hosea,"This story is supposed to be based on the biblical book of Hosea but I found the author strayed a long way from it. First, there was no use of little girls in the biblical story at all and I found no need for that subject in a Christian book. I just found it a very strange, frustrating and disturbing book to follow. Slow and wordy."
3,Good Book But...,"Good story, but could have been a little less detailed in some parts or shortened by several incidents."
2,A little- too heavy on religion.,"A friend who is a born again Christian, recommended this book highly. It is a fine book however, although i am a Christian, attend church weekly, it was slightly ""over the top for me"""
3,"""REDEEMING LOVE""",THIS WAS AN INTERESTING BOOK TO READ. I KNEW NOTHING ABOUT IT OR THE AUTHOR. IT WAS ENTERTAINING AND DEFINETLY HELD MY ATTENTION. I WANTED TO PEAK AT AT THE END BUT I DID NOT. IT IS A VERY GOOD BOOK.
5,Beautiful truthful novel,"Rivers has written an amazing story with ""Redeeming Love."" I learned so many life lessons from this book, the main one being: Leave it to God. He will take care of you. Don't rely on your own strength and wisdom, but rather, His. No matter how painful an event in our life is, it is there for a reason. Usually, it brings us closer to God because we are forced by our weakness to come to Him for strength. I truly recommend this book to anyone who is hurting and who is dissatisfied with life. I also really enjoyed the quotes written before each chapter that serve as a preview of the lesson to be learned in that chapter."
5,E X C E L L E N T ! !,"This book is the whole reason why I became so very interested in biblical fiction. If you ever, even for one small second, believed that you were not good enough for God's love, read this book! This is a must read for anyone....non-Christian, new believer, old believer, ""born again""...I told everyone about this book and how it changed my life forever! The good Lord has so much in store for each of us and Francine Rivers is amazing at allowing that to show through in her writing."
3,A romance novel,"I got this book because I wanted to read something different, and it was one of the highest-rated books by the reviewers. Having read very few romance novels, it was an adjustment for me to accept the kind of novel this is. Predictable, simple, sappy, one-sided are adjectives to describe the plot. However, for me, it was also unique, somewhat spiritual, and refreshing at the same time. We all enjoy reading certain types of material. I can slightly recommend this book as a diversion. It is painfully predictable, but the idea of a 19th century farmer trying to reform a prostitute was intriguing enough. I found it less to be about Christianity, but more about the universal themes of forgiveness and acceptance. The high average review rating does not reflect some masterful writing and a book of universal appeal. Instead, I think most of the people who read romance novels are doing the reviewing, and this book seems to be one of the better of such novels."
5,This is a MUST read!,"A friend once told me to read this book when I looking for something interesting. I didn't think too much about it and didn't act on it at that time. A few months later I kind of stumbled upon the book. When I picked up and started reading it, I couldn't put it down. I took it to work, read it between taking calls and on every break and when I got home. I managed to read almost 500 pages in just a couple of days.I love the book. It made me cry so hard. I felt such a deep connection with Angel. I've never had to live a life like hers but I realized just how much God loved me because of the book.It is one of the most beautiful things I have ever read in my entire life! You have GOT to read it."
5,A change of heart,"The book ""Redeeming Love"" is a very captivating and suspensful book. It brings the power of Gods unchanging and perfect love for his people in a way that one can understand much better. The book can bring a life changing experience to each one that reads it, if they open their heart to Gods Redeeming Love."
1,Just another romance novel,"I bought this hoping to find a powerful story of Christian love and was pretty disappointed. It was just like any romance novel, sprinkling the ""voice of God"" around everywhere to justify their actions. Unbiblical and self-indulgent. Slightly better written than Twilight."
1,Really?,"I am astounded at the numerous 5-star reviews for this book! It's downright cheesy, and reads like an 8th-grade creative writing project. I can't even finish it. What a disappointment."
3,Redeming Love,"A little girl named Sara lived in a home with a mother that had her with a married man, he didn't want the baby but the mother had her anyway, Soon the mother had to go into prostitution in order to live. She died and Sara was sold to a man that just wanted to use little girls. Now she is know an Angel and works in a house of ill repute. She is the highest paid soiled dove in the place and the men had to really have the gold to just get their name put in the pot for her.Michael a farmer saw her walking down the street and he knew that he was going to marry her. But what a time he had to get married to her and then she kept running off. Will she ever learn that a man can love a woman without it always being sex. She had lived such a life that she didn't know any better.Can he get her to believe there is a God that will always walk beside her."
4,Redeeming Love,"Seemed to take a long time to arrive...a good 3 weeks, I think??? But...condition was excellent."
1,Does she..Does she not..Does she...Does she not...repeat,"This book has some good points and it does really have some insightful wisdom, but I guess to me it seemed like you were at a stand still for the good majority of the book with some small up's and downs that just let you feeling like you were back at the beginning again. I actually found myself irritated at times during this book which I've never really experienced reading a book before. Last words: it's long, it's repetitive and well...I hope you like it better than I did..truly!"
5,God Is In Every Breath You Take,"This book was the most amazing and moving experience I have ever had. I finished reading it last night while I wept in bed. I never knew what God's love really was before this book. I fell in love the characters!! I felt like I was living on the farm with Michael, Angel, and the Altmans, and it broke my heart each time Angel left. Francine Rivers writes in the end of this book that it was God's will that she write this book and I know with all of my heart that God used her as a tool to reach all of His children. I, with all of my heart and soul, pray that EVERYONE reads and absorbs every loving ounce of this book."
5,Beautifully written interpretation leaves an impression,This book had been favorably recommended to me by a number of people so I thought I would see what the reviewers of Amazon had to say. I was amazed to see that over 550 reviews were available and stunned to see that less than 30 of those reviewers gave it 4 stars or less. So I bought the book and am now one of the 500+ people to agree to the 5 stars.Rivers has a beautiful interpretation of the Biblical book of Hosea. I believe this to be a tastefully written work handling such a delicate subject as redeeming the life of a prostitute through the committed love of a Godly husband. Rivers is sensual without being too explicit and gives a raw look into the depleted heart of a lifetime harlot.Need encouragement in the choices of your own life? Read this book as I did and find new hope in what God wants for you.
5,A really great book!,This is a book that should not be read by people who are not ready to experince a journy through out a book. I lvr this book!
5,Great book,"Very good story with lessons in faith, forgiveness, hope and love. Fast moving and a book you cannot put down."
1,Uncle!,"This is a very slim book - however, it could not keep my interest long enough to finish it. Reading this novella requires real dedication, because it has no chapters and no breaks.Planet 8 is besieged by drastic climate change, and the inhabitants change their entire society on the advice of Canopus, another, more advanced race. The buildup was incredibly slow, and I frequently found my eyes sliding off the page. I finally gave up when I found myself grinding my teeth at the thought of picking up the book again."
2,As New-Agy as it gets.,"I read good reviews about this CD and how it wasn't New Agy but very recharging and balancing. I'm listening to it now and honestly I don't think I could play this for my clients. It is way too New Age. If that's your thing, you'll probably like it. But it's not my thing, and I don't."
3,movie in a Bi twist,"Holly Ferguson, Todd Kerns, Ryan Robbins. Independent film-maker Kirsten Clarkson presents a story about a 23 year-old artist who struggles with her insatiable appeitite for both men and women and her wish for a real relationship."
3,Not quite there.,"Tammy Wynette is one of my favorites artists. However, I give this DVD 3 stars strictly on the strength of my love for her. The quality is minimal, at best--the picture jumps, and is a bit blurry at full screen. I find it incredible with a star of this magnitude, more and better quality material is not available. The ""In Concert"" DVD is better quality, at least from the ""jumping"" perspective, but it too is not the best video quality. One redeeming feature of the DVD is a lengthy interview with Tammy, but the video quality is about the same. There is some useless promo material on the video, not related to Wynette. If you're a die-hard, buy it; there seems to be little else out there."
2,"DVI Freezes at random, no fix as of 2006/03/09","I like this tv, but the DVI feed video freezes at random for a random amount of time. As of 2006/03/09 Hitachi knows about it and doesn't have a fix. Also there is no HDMI and not enough component video inputs.On the cool side, it can swivel on it's base by remote control.I can't recommend this product, especially at the current price."
3,Author all but ignores Julian's anti-Christian polemics.,"I found the book thoroughgoing in biographic details on Julian's life. But particularly disappointing is the author's neglect of Julian's anti-Christian arguments, which make fascinating reading. Oddly, Bowersock ignores, in his Bibliography, the 3-volume set of Julian's writings published some years ago by Loeb Classics. This omission is especially galling since B. maintains many of J.'s writings are unavailable, but some he so characterizes ARE available in the Loeb volumes! Of particular interest was J.'s diatribe against the ""Galilean,"" Jesus--which is found in Loeb, but all but ignored in Bowersock's book. This is perplexing to say the least."
4,The fairest treatment a Christian is allowed to give,"Let me say first that Julian II is my favorite emperor. I spent more than $500 to have one of his ""Apis"" coins made into a pendant. That being said, I don't know what the other reviewers have agains Mr. Bowersock. Julian did have a temper. From certain perspectives he did persecute Christians. But, as for sheer unbiased treatment of ALL the extant contemporaneous sources, this book does a wonderful job. Rather than getting the feeling that Mr. Bowersock was chastizing Julian for his temper it was more like he was explaining the public sentiment or sometimes (sometimes painfully) making excuses for him. I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to know a little bit more about the ""last pagan emperor"". Not only was Mr. Bowersock very scholarly, but very entertaining to read. The only reason it missed five stars by me is because the maps (only 2, alas) were almost indecipherable - and this from an (amateur) student of ancient history."
1,"Lovers of history, halt!","You can learn more reading either Julian's writings, other primary sources and other books.There is nothing I can say that has not been said before about this book. Just, read another book - that is actually objective (The Last Pagan, etc.). Or reading Julian's writings, that are available free on the internet. This has been a phenomenal waste of time. I learned nothing but the dripping scorn and contempt the auhor has about the subject he is writing about.Books about a historical personage has to be even handed and objective; if subjective, it has to be a plausible interpretation based on the primary sources. This book is neither."
4,Eccentric and Charming,"I bought this book because of its alluring cover and its title. I decided to pick it off my bookshelf, where it was gathering dust, on the whim of a moment. And I'm quite happy I did.Merele Day writes beautifully - I found myself re-reading some passages just for their beauty. A lovely atmosphere is created in this story - an isolated island inhabited by the three surviving nuns of a crumbling monastery who spend their days in ritual worship, knitting, and story-telling. There's a herd of sheep that they tend - which they believe embody the spirits of nuns of their order who have passed on.The magic of the story begins when a young priest comes to the island to evaluate the property for a potential resort to bring income to the church. As soon as the nuns figure out his intent, a most humorous chain of events take place.The use of faith, fairy tale, myth, ritual and memory weave the fine fabric of the world of these endearing characters brilliantly. It's charming!"
4,"Builds Slowly, A Unique Novel","Took a bit of gumption to stay with this past the first few pages, but that's part of the beauty of this strange, unpredictable novel.It is very difficult to write a review of this book which does not contain spoilers, but I will try.It's a novel of the mind sequestered, of the strange qualities of faith, of mysteries that unfold with precision and satisfaction.Marele Day has crafted this quite wonderfully, and the tension and mystery build like a good suspense film.If you like Gabriel Garcia Marquez, you'll probably like this. Though not exactly magic realism, Lambs of God has plenty of the supernatural about it. I loved the little sprinkle of the gothic, and the way the whole story plunged me into something totally unlike anything I've read, ever.I'll leave it at that."
3,A GOOD BOOK THAT I WANTED TO BE MUCH BETTER,"In places, this book delivers some of the most enjoyable storytelling I've read in some time. Yet, it fails to carry this momentum throughout the story. The author's tendency to switch between present and past tense in some chapters is in some ways distracting. The lives of the three nuns and their captive audience never failed to intrigue me. While the open ending leaves room for a sequel, it left this reader disappointed in a enjoyable story that was left half-finished."
1,STAY AWAY!!,"This movie SUCKED and not in a good Vampire sort of way. It is a complete and utter waste of time. Bad acting, poor sound quality, a pathetic script, and no plot. And then there's the vampire who HANDS crosses to the main the characters so they can kill another vampire.... I'm so glad it was free with my Prime membership 'cause I'd've been upset if I'd spent money on this trash!"
5,For Dreamers,"Years ago I looked for this one and only came up with the French version, beautiful, but my limited French didn't allow me to transport myself to another time. For Spanish speakers, or if you understand it well, one word, GORGEOUS!"
5,What I was looking for,"This is my first light tent, It looks well made and is easy to open and to store...ok.. I had to see the website from photoflex in order to figured out how to close it....the liteIgloo and this one are very similar, so is the same process. Big enough for now. My only complain... they need to remove or update the picture here in Amazon, the other customer was right, it came just the Light tent, no backdrops at all."
5,Excellent!,"This product was excellent! I've had it for years and it still functions perfectly. I used existing studio lights, lamps, the sun, etc and all worked well! Great for product shots."
5,Down Dirty & Real,"Trust me, as a life long blues lover this is the real deal. I first heard Paul in 1977 and was blown away then. His Harp Man Andy is the best in the midwest and Paul WoW . 5 stars"
3,JUST A LITTLE SHORT OF A DOLLAR,"THIS CD IS GOOD, BUT ON A WHOLE NOT MY TYPE OF BLUES. A LITLE TOO ""ROCKISH"" AND ""'BILLYISH"" FOR ME.THE SLIDE PLAYING WAS VERY GOOD THOUGH, AND SO WAS THE HARP. I LIKED MOST OF THEIR COVERS...EXCEPT ""THE LAST TIME"". NOT REALLY A BLUES NUMBER NO MATTER HOW HARD YOU TRY TO FIT IT INTO A ""ROUND HOLE"". OF THEIR ORIGINALS, I LIKED ""PAULIE'S LITTLE NIGHTMARE"" BEST. NOT THE WORST BLUES CD I'VE HEARD....BUT NOT THE BEST. JERSEY SLIM"
1,Lady Cocoa is a No-No!,"Let me first start by saying that Lola Falana is the only reason one would want to watch this movie. She's beautiful and a joy to watch from beginning to end. However the quality of the film is horrible, sometimes the lighting is too bright and sometimes too dark. If that's not bad enough, the sound quality makes it almost impossible to hear the dialoque; I had to watch it a few times to piece together the shaky story, which takes me to my next point, the plot. The plot was weak, but possibly could have been saved if they had a better screenplay.This film was disappointing for me, although it was great seeing the lovley Lola Falana in her prime, and of course Mean Joe Green!!! I only recommend this to the die hard Lola Falana fans. It's a shame that the quality of this DVD was so poor!"
5,Awesome Ronnie!!!,"Ronnie McDowell does not get near the recognition he so deserves. Not only can he sing Elvis Presley so well you cannot tell the difference between Ronnie and Elvis, he is so talented in his own right and humbly does not recognize how great he is. Ronnie should be hailed as the great talent that he is, and believe me his fans do give him what he deserves, praise and adulation. Thanks Ronnie for giving us you."
2,This set would discourage any future woodburner.,"My 8 yr old son got this from his grandfather for Christmas. I was eager to help him with this, as I had a similar woodburning kit when I was his age. From what I recall about my set, it would actually ""burn"" the wood. This one doesn't get hot enough to use effectively. My son traced 3 letters in his name and got bored with it because he had to move the iron so slowly with lame results.It seems to me that, over the years, they regulated the fun out of this toy. :("
3,disappointed first time,I have ordered from Amazon for years. This is the first time I was disappointed. The woodburning set was not taped or wrapped in anything.It was open at my front door. With a packing slip on it.
4,Son loves this but...,"The wood burning pen takes forever to heat up to be able to burn the wood correctly. Also, the pointy tip will not burn a straight line and not sure how to do it so the line doesn't look broken. The pen handle also gets very hot and you have to hold it further up which makes it hard to control.Other than that, this kit came with lots of wood, patterns and also comes with paint and glue. We're satisfied with the kit and my son is enjoying it."
2,Was expecting a better quality product,"I was expecting a better quality product. A woodburning pen produces a very soft/light impression on the wood, which could be barely seen. Plus, one of the cutout pieces was missing from the box.I've had a similar kit when I was a child, which was much more fun to use and easier to operate."
2,Not so great...,"Wood burning tool is essentially a soldering iron. It is very cumbersome to hold and control. I had purchased this a gift for my daughter, and after one use, it hasn't been touched again!"
5,"A delight, indeed","If you've landed on this page, that means you're going to love this album. What a fun, groovy listen. At once fresh and retro, laid back and strimulatimg... I've has this cd on my radar for a few months and I'm glad that I got it. It's very versatile and all in uncompromisingly cool. Some elements of world, new age, beat, jazz all blended smoothly into a rich yet transcendental mojo for whatever might be ailing you. Let it waft over you like a breeze... smokey or not."
2,Name is misleading,This snack is WAY TOO SWEET! I don't taste anything salty at all. Would not buy again. The kids didn't even like it.
2,large capacity slow access speed,"This USB flash storage device is as convenient to use as any. It's credit card form is convenient for carrying in a wallet. It has a very large capacity. The major disadvantage is that accessing the file system is slow.Data can be accessed fast enough that music and most videos can be played back without skipping. However, expect to spend many hours to transfer the full capacity of data on to or off this storage device. To navigate through folders or open or save files is also frustratingly slow."
2,Yankee Doodles do not hold their weight in the snack food world,+ Creme Filling+ I suppose they taste alright if you can prevent them from falling apart all over the floor.- You cannot prevent them from falling apart all over the floor.- They are unbelievably dry.
1,Drake's couldn't carry Hostess's spit bucket,"As my friends and fans know (and I thank each and every one of you, for we are all God's children), I love to snack on tasty - though nutritionally-challenged - sweet treats. But the truth must be told: Drake's is an utter joke and say what you will about Hostess, the fact remains that Drake's will never be able to match up.It is so true, too, that these unusually named 'Yankee Doodles' are dry and crumbly. If you MUST eat them, DON'T attempt to do so in an automobile. You'll be finding crumbs for months afterward, and every time you will be reminded of how much you regretted eating one in the first place."
5,Drop everything and BUY THIS JOINT NOW,"Mountain Brothers, a trio of Philasiatic MCs drop PHAT Jazzy hip-hop. Every track on this CD is listenable, and most of them are dope. My favorite track by far is Galaxies (The next level) the Jazz track underneath is reminiscent of a 70's TV show theme song, and could survive on it's own, it's that phat. This is the ANTIDOTE for wack commercial MCs like Puffy and Big Pun (RIP baby). If you buy this CD and don't like it, Ill reimburse you, that's how dope I know it is."
5,Much respect due...,"The mountain Brothers mainly looped me in with their heavy bass riffs and jazzy keyboards, somewhat reminiscent of A Tribe Called Quest. Upon further listening, I give full props to the trio. It's nice to see the hip-hop attitude being treated as an art instead of a money maker."
3,nice,"great group, great cd. Kinda like the flavor of native tongues. these guys will go down in history as one of the first big asian things in the game."
2,More Hype than Mr. Williams,"""Mountain Brothers are dope! Mountain Brothers... off the hzook! Mountain Brothers are... blah, blah, blah...""Man, you should have heard how much people were recommending this album to me. There was so much hype. I was beginning to think that maybe the Mountain Brothers were the epitome of dope. So what'd I do? I bought into it and picked up the album. And now I wish I had 17 dollars in my pocket instead.It's not that they're all that bad, it's just that they sound sort of dated. Sounds like rap, looks like rap, it must be rap, but not necessarily great rap. Sounds like Native Tongues circa 1993. And 1993 happened a long time ago.And the comparisons to Black Star? Forget it. That's just foolish. I understand the reference to the the Ugly Ducklyings though, since those guys are straight wack.Don't believe the Hype."
2,Skip it for middle school age,"Recommended in Well-Trained Mind but WAY too difficult for that age-level, and the writing is somewhat old-fashioned and dry. Better for adult reading."
4,Does the Job,This product does it's job very well. I did not give it 5 stars because it does not last as long as I would like it to.
1,Didn't work at all,This thing didn't work at all. Nothing caught. Fruit flies are still buzzing around my head.
1,Not so great,"The trap was place right next to where our fruit fly problem is, and it didn't catch a single one! Very disappointed."
3,too expensive,"Much to expensive and very difficult to find I Got it,finally, from Amazon.Refills are impossible to find so you end up with 2 small jars, empty.It does draw the fruit flies."
3,"ok, not the best trap",i have fruit fly in my house. decide to buy this trap. it only trapped 4 fruit fly and that was it. the fruit fly dont even fly into it anymore. my hands work much better then this fruit fly trap.
1,No Good,"I bought these cuz of my awful fruit fly problem, I got them and has been about a week and i think one fly went in it and died. I put a cup of kool-aid out and it has killed 100 times as many as my fruit fly traps. I would give these a half star pretty worthless"
5,Salty Goodness!,"This is just about the best rock salt I have ever seen, and in my life, I have had to have used at least 2 diffrent brands!"
1,Horrible,"This thing sucks. All it does is barely vibrates. DO NOT BUY!!!! That was the worst bit of money I ever spent. And they will not let you return it and get a refund. Again, DO NOT BUY!!"
1,Works for a while,"Bad build, i feel like this was made up someones botty crack broke after the 2nd use. Not really worth it truly."
2,This STINKS,I thought this product would shock the person but its just a stupid little buzz that feels like nothing DONT BUY!!!
2,Not what I was expecting.,"Turned out to be a toy that you spin up everytime and doesn't really shock you. Overall, didn't think it was worth it."
2,sucks,This is somthing i got out of a 50 cent machine if it actually shocked people i would recommend it
3,OK,These were fun and the shipping was quick. Made great stalking stuffers but don;t feel they will last long. and hte buzz doesn't go off every time which to an 8 yr old can be very anticlimactic.
1,A Waste of Money,"I should have read the other reviews that were not favorable about this product before making my purchase. The buzzer just doesn't work the way you think it should. The huge switch has to be ""triggered"" or moved by the person who is shaking your hand in order for any sort of a ""buzz"" to happen. In other words, the handshake needs to really be firm and done in a way where the switch will be triggered. When and if buzzes (I tested it several times) the ""buzz"" is minimal and would probably go unnoticed by your ""unsuspecting"" target. Too much trouble for something that is supposed to be simple. This product is a ""fail""."
4,Buzzer is a joy,Toy buzzer came super fast and my little boy loves it. It's durable and has no defects. I would recommend this item!
1,"Awful, defective, not worth what i paid for","It doesn't work at all its a piece of junk, i regret buying this thing. I was hoping i would get some fun prank, but it just wasn't what i expected"
2,Very disappointed,"I expected this toy to shock, and all it did was vibrate. Should've specified this"
2,not a good buzzer,"i thought it was on of those when u touch it , it shocks you but you have to twist it its really loud so it was kinda a disipointment"
1,Not what they use to be.,"Cheaply made, it only lasted once then the spring broke. More chinese junk. Again it would cost more to ship it back than what it is worth."
2,Dissapointment,"This item was a fail. It doesn't even send a shock through anyone's hand. It just vibrates very hard, and it isn't even painful, you feel nothing. I eventually threw it away because it was never any fun to use."
4,Duro-Med Alternating Pressure Pump and Pad,"Duro-Med Alternating Pressure Pump and Pad, GrayThis equipment is designed for 110V 60 Hz operation and as such is suitable only for use in North America.It would help if this information is promptly displayed as part of the product descriptions.I purchased the equipment without being aware of this and have difficulties making use of the equipment in Australia. However, Amazon has been a very fair trader and has refunded me in full. Full marks to Amazon.Ken kwongQueenslandAustralia"
1,No thanks,"I expected soft, pillow like alternating air, but this product was like laying on lightly padded smooth rocks; and there wasn't enough motion action. My back hurt after one hour of laying on it. And the worst part is that the company has a policy not to accept returns on the item. I guess I've learned a big lesson about purchasing on the Internet."
1,Beware: Pressure not adjustable,"I bought not realizing that it is not adjustable like my previous model, the`Paradise Pump & Pad. Had to return it because the pad pressure was too high for me."
4,"Excellent, but I like SOLO better.","Beautiful piano work once again! Juan Gabriel is great. Not to familiar with the other singers. He's (Raul) recorded other great music.I rank this a 4 star. Solo and Piano De Americano I rate a 5. He's the best pianist I ever heard. I've been searching for a fan club of his for the past few years. Can anybody help? Also, anyone know if Raul is planning any concerts? All information would be appreciated. Thanks Jim Dempsey"
5,Wonderful CD!! You have to get it!,This is an absolutely BEAUTIFUL CD!! A MUST HAVE for anyone interested in gorgeous latin piano and orchestra (London Symphony) music. A masterpiece!
3,"Interesting, but mediocre.","All things considered, this is good historical fiction. The way it ends, however, was mixed. Raisha made the right decision. Some of the other characters did not. If you enjoy history, read it. If you are a Scott O'Dell fan, this is probably the best book that he could possibly do."
2,OH MY GOD!!!,"Ok, the beginning part was okay. When it starts talking about bravery of the runaways, I was excited, and kept reading the book. I enjoyed everything up to the last part: the crappy ending. What the hell is that, they all killed themselves? Sure, it gave them pride, for the ones who wanted to do it. Then again, the women who picked up their children to their deaths and Konje who convinced them too, terrified me!! What are they teaching you here?"
3,My Name is Not Angelica,"This was a typical Scott O'Dell book; sad and somewhat incomplete.It is the story of Raisha, who along with her fiance and some friends is kidnapped and sold into slavery. Overall, this book is okay. I notice that some people like the sad ending, but I am not too keen on it.CORRECTION:One reviewer states that Raisha becomes pregnant before she marries Konje and that is false.this is a good version."
3,Yes I Like it and You should Too!,"OK not all songs are great but the ones that are, are great. ""Highly Productive People"" and ""Ask Me"" are the strong favorites and easily understood and interpreted. These are songs that have ease and bite and make you want play ""dress up and bite me"". The sounds paint the imagery well and Adelheid AKA Heidi delivers an astonishly sensually and sensitive vocals with touching lyric content, especially on ""Highly Productive People"" which is a song about call girls and by far my favorite. I've been looking forward to new music from them as this is their first album. Hopefully, some will surface soon as we all have fantasies to live out. Enjoy!"
2,Skimming the (sub)surface,"This book is science at the level one sees on television. The emphasis is on the strange and unusual, liberally spiced with the author's opinions and prejudices. Alternative theories and explanations are either ignored or dismissed out of hand.Suitable for a juvenile audience."
5,"Life is Complex, Especially for Kids","This wonderful book reminds us that kids understand that life is hard and complex. Sometimes parents act like kids, with petty fights and prejudices, and kids may be the wisest peace makers in the end.Little Billy is told by his mom not to play with Rod, the big kid, whose truck driver father ""has tattoos."" But when Billy's father accidentally knocks out Rod's father's window, it is the kids who break up a potential fight. The boys teach their fathers to lighten up, and allow two very different families to make friends.Children love the emotional complexity of this story, and most parents will leave with something to think about."
2,not what I expected,"I wanted oriental meditation,and I got otherworldly orientalism,a case of mistaken identity."
5,Their least appreciated work,"This album is an excellent example of the range and diversity of Zao while also being possibly the least popular record in their catalog. I would even go so far as to say that, with the except of The Funeral Of God, this is their best record."
5,Very very good,"At first when i listened to the cd i was unsure wether i liked it or not, but now when i listen to it i love every second of it from the slow man in womb to the face bone jarring A Pirates Prayer. Over all its a definate need to have cd!"
4,Interesting,"I listened to Parade of Chaos when I was at a party 2 years ago. A guy who had just met me that night put in this cd and played Angel Without Wings. Surprisingly I was so excited about this song and put it in the stereo for everyone at the party to hear it. The guy who gave me a burned copy of the cd later on, became my boyfriend and got me into all of this metal phased music. Angel Without Wings has a great blend of screaming and singing that make it a song to remember. I really dont have any right to say that I am in love with this cd since I only like about 2 songs on the whole thing, and they are both soft and non-screaming, ironically not surprising for me.I recommend listening to this song no matter what type of music you're already involved in. It's not trying to change your personality, just your perspective that all screaming bands aren't bad.God Bless"
2,That's a shame,"""Parade of Chaos."" Alright, let me get the good things said. I love Dan's growl and some of the music. Now onto what is bad. I'm not limited to listening to only hardcore and I understand how Zao wanted to try to be more ""well rounded"". But that doesn't mean the listener should have to listen to crap. Zao should have stopped with ""Liberate"" and not puncture fan's hearts with `self titled' and this. ""Blood and Fire"" was their finest work. This was their worst."
3,Previews were interesting,I bought this one because of some outstanding reviews. But to be honest it hits my feeling of good music only in parts.
4,a country boy can rock,"A live Hank Williams show sounds like a real good time. His covers of Sweet Home Alabama,Working for MCA and LaGrange are not as good as the originals and are shorter than the originals but they do rock. Particularly like his version of the Animals House of the Rising Sun. The songs, If you dont like Hank Williams and a country boy can survive along with the covers of Skynyrd, ZZ Top and the Animals are the best offerings on this CD."
3,I must completely agree with some of the reviewers,"Now, I love Bocephus. I own every one of his albums and have his first ever MGM live album, Live At Cobo Hall, which I now have on CD. That album, is pure Hank! This album is a complete waste of time. I prefer Hank in the studio doing his work like with a few of the reviewers said, but this live CD is not Hank at his live best. He sure can rock though very good in the studio! Love him!:)"
3,"Good, could be better","Just got this cd. While the music is good, enough rockers for sure, some of the tunes are just too damn short. For example Sweet Home Alabama only had the chorus to the song one time. That song is kinda anthemic and feels completely incomplete without the whole song. But the band was rocking it good, I was looking forward to more and then it ended. I wonder if Hank just plain didn't remember all the lyrics. But I was hoping this album would be more. It kills the flow when you're just getting in to the groove of a song and it abruptly endsI agree with an earlier reviewer as well: Some of it is to serve Hank's ego. Notice how many songs are about the city and famous people and his dad?so before you buy, LOOK AT THE TIME LENGTH OF THE SONGS to make sure you get what you want. If I was at a concert like that, honestly I would be pretty disappointed. But I'm a Springsteen fan, so maybe I'm using an unfair comparison."
