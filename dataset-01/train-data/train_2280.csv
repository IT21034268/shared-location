1,Disappointing,"I too was disappointed that it was ""The Miracle Strain"" with a different name. If you like adventure mysteries with biblical history overtones I recommend ""Dark Passage"" by Junius Podrug. It will give you incite on the past and a rude awakening on the present. ""The more things change, the more they stay the same""!!"
4,The Messiah Code - Michael Cordy,"I have to agree with other reviewers that the plot was really interesting and the book very good. I thought the characters were developed well, and the scientific information necessary to further the story was presented clearly at the right level. I did not figure this one out until right before the major twist was revealed, and really enjoyed the ending. I will definitely read more of Cordy's books in the future."
2,"Guitar Basics: Step 2, Acoustic",Very basic instruction of basic guitar chords.It is a very short video of 30 minutes.The instructor starts off extremly slow with easy major chords and then takes off at the end with bar chords and leaves you hanging.It seemed to be rushed at the end as if the director was telling the intructor he was running out of time.
3,My Least Favorit Myron Bolitar Novel,"I have ready several books by Harlen Coben, especially the Myron Bolitar series. But man, this book was just so uninspiring. I even thought about not finishing the book, but I did. It was just so... Blah, and expected, and not what I have come to expect from this Coben. There was nothing exciting that grabbed me. The book is very mediocre and unoriginal.I fully recommend reading other Bolitar novels, just not this one..."
4,"A good detective yarn, even with the golf....","A Jewish publicist who is an amateur detective, Coben's character Myron Bolitar is always fun. This is a murder mystery associated with the game of golf. You don't have to be an expert in golf, though, as Myron certainly isn't. Lots of twists and turns. A good detective yarn. Yeah, I know, this is an ""old book"" by today's standards, but isn't it nice to go back in an author's opus and find enjoyable reading?"
4,Back Spin,One of the better Myron Bolitar books. Was tempted to read all night. Credibility of character Win is a bit too much!After this book you just want to read more of Harlan Coben.
2,"Does ""Classic"" mean previously released?","This is not a new story. Back Spin was the 4th release in the Myron Bolitar series. Also, this is not the first time Harlan Coban has released one of his older works without making it clear that it was a redo."
4,Back Spin,"He's an excellent writer. As long as he doesn't get too detailed with the ""behavior"" of his lawyer partner, he's fine."
3,the only disappointing book in the series,"Back Spin, for me, only got going way late in the book. Perhaps it was my utter indifference towards the plot, which was not nearly as interesting as Coben's previous novel in the series, ""Fade Away"". Plus the humor just wasn't there as it was in the other Myron books. Perhaps it was due to Win's absence in most of the novel. The ""twists"" were only okay too.I recommend that people read the Myron Bolitar series in order, starting with Deal Breaker, but to skip Back Spin. Fade Away was Coben's best MB book. Gone for Good is his best stand-alone."
3,Disappointment,"I am a fan of Mr Coban & M. Bolitar, Eaq., but I liked this book less than the 5 I've read previously. The reason is that the plot is way too convoluted. There is no way the reader can follow, because new facts are dropped into the stew up to the very end. The author & the hero readily admit they see little sense in golf. Perhaps this is why this novel makes less sense that their others."
2,What's the plot?,If the plot is about golf and you're not a golfer is boring.If the plot is about kidnapping you'll read almost zilch about it.If the plot is about repartees forget it.So read another book instead.
5,One of the top Myron Bolitar books,I have read all of the MB books and this one is definitely in the top 3 or so. Once again it is a pure mystery that this time reveals a great deal about the character of Win and why he is the way he is. I enjoyed some of the golf jokes as well. Great book!
5,Back Spin,Loved this book. Once I picked it up I just had to keep reading until the end! Love the Myron Bolivar mysteries...l' d recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good mystery.
5,Wonderful,I love this whole series. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a book they can't put down! Can't wait to read the next one!
4,harlin,His books are always first rate.I've read them all;then pass them on.Next up is reading his latest. It tells about a sports agent's work.
3,A Good Read,"Overall I found Back Spin to be a very good read. I've read others in the series but missed this one from 1997. As usual Harlan has his humor and a well executed story with his trademark dialogue. Yet too much stuff early on did telegraph the eventual ending so I can't say the twists and turns were really that good but it was enjoyable entertainment, especially if you're a golfer. Easy to see much of Harlan's later work is more solid. Despite that and some weak, predictable story points a good read which kept me turning the pages."
3,Harlan Coben - Back Spin,The Myron Bolitar books are light reading - am not planning to hold on to these - wish I had bought them used or borrowed them from the library
4,fade away,"Haven't read this book yet, but It sounds really good, I love Harlen Coben.the problem is how do I know which book starts the series?Please tell Me where to go to find this out for any author, for that matter."
3,Won Me Back,"I had read One False Move and enjoyed it but it didn't make me what to dive into the series. I likes this one a lot better. It kept moving and all the characters had important roles to play without becoming so intertwined that you couldn't tell them without a scorecard. I am a hard grader so 3 stars means a good read. There are actually some funny moments in the books as opposed to most jacket reviews that use words like zany and outragious without actually knowing what they mean. It was set in suburban Phila, my home area, so I was partial to the book from the start but that didn't color my opinion. I'm going to get some more Bolitar books."
2,Boring...,"Really... I didn't like it. Not so horrible, but boring. I've read a lot of Harlan's books and loved all of them, but this one didn't seduce me."
3,It's Okay,The humor is good but the technology is so outdated it is a bit laughable. Not a terrible read. Just not my favorite.
5,"Amazing performance, Incredible sound!!!","This is by far the most realistic recording of a symphony orchestra that I have ever heard. The wonderfully rich, warm sound of this great orchestra has never been captured as well as on this disc. There really is a ""you are there"" sound to it. To me it sounds very ""un-digital"", which is the highest complement one can give to a CD! Just as on their EMI recordings, the performance is just what one would expect from Sawallisch and the Philadelphia Orchestra: polished, exciting, and without question the best!"
2,Moderately decent performances marred by poor acoustics,"Sawallish's performances of the Dvorak Overtures and Les Preludes (Liszt) are decent enough - but the orchestra's playing is pedestrian and not focused. The acoustics are terrible with balance non-existant. Strings are weak, so much so that a single tambourine (in the Carnival Overture [12 measures before rehearsal letter ""L""]) is able to blot them out completely. There is no virtue in a bottomless orchestra. Having conducted in The Academy of Music, I know, from performance experience, what is possible. This recording is interesting purely to demonstrate the limits of older technology. It is NOT to be recommended, either for the performances and certainly not for the recording. If you want examples of excellent recordings ""the old way"" you need to go back to the old Mercury series (Dorati, Paray, et al.) to see (i.e. hear) how it should be done."
1,"Great sound is just that, great sound.","Great music is so much more. Slow, plodding, lifeless; not qualities one would associate with Liszt. This release helps explain why people question the pursuit of the absolute sound."
2,Not Durable as I expected,"I purchased this product in April. The programming was simple and I am extremely pleased with the operation of the water timer. I checked the unit last week 7/13 and noticed the LCD screen was not working. I changed the batteries and nothing happened......I cannot see the screen. I called the 800 number and it belongs to another company, the website does not work, Wal-mart's warranty was 90 days(so I cannot exchange it)and I do not want to pay for another unit. I decided to spend the extra money and purchase this product, which states it's suppose to be extremely durable. I live in Texas so that means somewhat durable, the unit was placed on a spicket that did not get direct sunlight during the day, and the weather here has been warm (in the mid/late 90's)but not as hot as it can get for July (102-115). This is a good product but make sure you don't mind buying one every couple of months."
1,"After one season, LCD no longer works","While it lasted, this was a reliable device, but after only one season of use, the LCD no longer displays anything. While the valves still open and close properly, the unit useless since I cannot set the time, set any programs or see what programs are currently set."
1,LCD Failure - 3 months later,"I too am victim of the LCD failure. I have had the unit since for 2 months. Easy to program, worked great however the LCD unit no longer works."
1,Broken product deliverd,"The timer central dial is broken and must be returned - it was pretty visible and could have been caught by minimal inspection. Also Amazon said that I ""qualified"" for free fast 1-2 day delivery but what actually happened was the supplier did not have the stock on hand and it was delivered 2 weeks later.Overall I am very disappointed"
1,Nelson programmable water timer,"The year I purchased two of these, I thought I'd hit a goldmine. They were easy to program and worked beautifully. The next year the display faded so it was unreadable, and my gold had turned to lead."
3,L.R.Nelson 5945 LCD failures,"I just (Sep. 7, 2007) spoke with someone at the L.R.Nelson customer service line. (Their web-site, at www.lrnelson.com, lists two support numbers, one just for the electronic timer devices). The tech I spoke to sighed deeply and said, they know of the problem but haven't found a solution to it yet.For the time being, though, if you mail them your receipt for the problem timer, if it failed with a dead LCD, they'll send you a new unit.Temporary approach, because the problem MAY be caused by exposure to sunlight (the tech said), is to keep the unit's display covered over. She suggested using black electricians' tape, but I suspect that a cardboard or foil flap would do as well and not be a problem to remove. I'm buying one anyway -- and keeping the receipt until the warranty runs out."
2,"ok, but I would not recommend",I've only read half the book and have stopped. While she does offer some good stories and a few suggestions I found the book monotonious. It was filled with a run on story about her work with others stories thrown in the middle; instead of ALL the stories (about CEOs and heads of comapnies - I couldn't relate) shorten the book and give the suggestions.
2,Eeh...,"I bought 8 of these pedal coupler cables from Sam Ash a few weeks back, but I'm kinda wishing I didn't. The cable seems durable enough and I've noticed no change in my guitar's tone, but being only 6"" long they are extremely inflexible. They're meant to be used as shown in the product pic; the way they're packaged. Even straightening the cable is difficult. Should be priced under $5 each."
3,G.F. Handel's Solomon,"Every praise to this recording be paid. Great singers!Ev'n tho' Gardiner's scissors are present too: ""...I decided in the overall interest of the dramatic continuity of the piece to sacrifice Sheba's first and Solomon's last aria, and with less regret two of Zadok's airs and one of the Levite's"".He changed completely the final of this oratorio, the question is: Should Mr. Gardiner choose what we have to listen to?The answer, absolutely NO.I prefer McGegan's system: He put the whole music in the CDs; so with the CD player system everyone can program the sequences of the work."
2,Weird and Irrelevant,"Most of the essayists here write badly on purpose. Most importantly, however, they are all trying to explain why they are not postmodernists. Nietzsche is almost never discussed. Lots of them are disgusted by Clement Rossett's description of them as ignorant of Nietzsche. This might be worth the time of a few folks. But the title of the volume is misleading in the extreme. Why we hate Rossett would have been good. Why we can't see beyond our PoMo numbness would have been better."
1,"no stars at all,....alias zero !","it is not different,..you can buy the cd's in your local stores!what a boring released it is! only old footage , interviews with the fans but no music from the band!you check out Deep purple, or led zeppelin DVD collections are much much better than this one!"
5,a great but for johnny horton fans,"what some of these reviewers don't understand is that this is a box set, it's for hardcore fans. as a huge johnny horton fan i can do nothing but tell you if don't like alternate versions or different takes or only like the hits, don't buy this. but johnny horton is one of my favorite musicians of all time, he transcends all those historical saga songs so many times over it's ridiculous to even say so. the songs and the soul present on this set are before johnny ever made it big (though he did redo several songs)and are for the true fan, the ones who take music seriously and recognise johnny horton for what he was: one of the best musicians of all time."
4,A Holiday Favorite,"While not technically a Christmas album, this probably spends as much time in my CD player during the holidays as any of my more traditional Christmas albums. The music may be overly familiar even to the casual fan (who won't recognize ""Dance of the Sugar-Plum Fairy,"" ""Russian Dance"" or ""Waltz of the Flowers""?), but just like Bing Crosby's ""White Christmas"" or Nat King Cole's ""The Christmas Song,"" it's just not Christmas without ""The Nutcracker."" [The CD also includes ""Serenade for Strings in C,"" which more than doubles the playing time to 51:40.] HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
2,review of CD: Nutcracker Suite,"The musical quality of the CD is not in question as it was what I expected. The problem was the CD itself. The first time I played it, it skipped on the first track. I saw no reason for it when inspecting the CD so assume it happened during the manufacture of it."
2,Couldn't read it.,"Maybe its me, but I could not read this book. Its the writing style I couldn't get through. I couldn't understand what he was writing and after a while, I just gave up. A book should be relaxing. This book was work."
2,bloated,"Marcus is sometimes capable of great insight. Unfortunately these rare gems are sandwiched between pages and pages of rambling nonsense. This guy mistakes the blips and farts of his slightly soft brain matter for objective sociological insight. Well I, for one, won't stand for it. Down with Marcus and all he stands for."
2,mystery train blues,"I had to struggle to get through this one. I found the writing style contrived and full of meandering attempts at placing rock and roll in a larger philosophical context. If you can get past the uninspired political & cultural observations, and also the party line, accepted musical interpretations as well as a writing style still staggering from the excesses of the 60's then perhaps this is the book for you. There is also a minor point of a liberal interpretation of the facts (such as the erroneous retelling of the meeting between Elvis and Nixon in the footnotes of the ""ELVIS: Presliad"" chapter). If you're looking for good, intelligent, insightful commentary on rock and blues music I recommend Peter Guralnick, who lives up to the praise that undeservedly graces the back of ""Mystery Train""."
1,I will never read anything by this author again!,"I was SO excited about getting this in the mail to start reading, I had just read ""This Wheels on Fire"" by Levon Helm (which is AMAZING) and wanted to read more about that kind of music and read a critics take on it all and well...it was awful!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It was pretentious and cliche...all of it. I cannot understand why this book is supposed to be so great. He makes all of these assumptions about what these musicians bodies of work are really about or are supposed to represent but even to someone who was not alive during the time period, it is obvious B.S.! Marcus tries to explain that The Band's whole body of work is some sort of metaphor...that is about a ""worried man""...that their work is a story that they have made up to represent their fears and their vices. If you want to know what ""the weight"" is about, read Levon Helm's book which is honest, touching, inspiring AND informative."
1,"Astonishingly bad, by any standards","Back in the 70s, we hadn't yet learned to ""just say no."" Perhaps that's why some people liked _Mystery Train._ Rampant drug use is the only possible reason anyone might find this gibberish interesting or enlightening. It's so absurdly overwritten, so pompous, and so empty of actual meaning as to be beneath contempt. This is, to books about music, what ""Plan Nine From Outer Space"" is to sci-fi movies."
1,"yes PROFESSOR,","nearly alway predictable,POINTs SO OBVIOUS, ITS NON INSIGHTFULL,always mundane inducing MIGRAINE,MAINSTREAM AND BORING,so nearly accessible for,FOLLOWERS,not thinkers,PONDEROUS, without apology ,doesnt understand formalism FROM COW DUNG,its clearlY HORRIFIC,SPECIFIC AND DEPRESSING,more like a trainwreck[ not meant to be]stupidy MASKING reality, GET REAL LIVE IN THE REAL WORLD,his appropriations are BARELY TOLLERABLE, CHEW ON THIS POST HASTE, this belongs in the trasheep BLEEP."
4,The Landmark Randy Newman Chapter,"Many people love this book for ""Presleyiad"", the lengthy mythic analysis of Presley's career. Others like the Sly Stone chapter, or the riveting section on Robert Johnson. What makes this book special for me, however, is the Randy Newman chapter. Marcus may have been the first critic to propose that Newman was a great American composer and he makes a passionate, convincing case. In recent years Newman may have been embarrassed at being singled out so strongly by Marcus, and Marcus may disparage Newman's most recent work (unjustly, I think.) That doesn't change the landmark character of Marcus' great book. Too bad he went off the deep end with punk and ""Lipstick Traces."""
3,This is two cables,"From the picture and description, I was expecting a three-in-one AV cable: left, right, S-Video. It's not. It's a stereo audio cable plus an S-Video cable."
2,Weak,"Other books in the Signature Licks series include both full-speed and slowed-down musical examples on the CD for the tougher/faster passages. This one only includes full-speed tracks, which really limits its use. You may as well just buy a regular tab book or transcribe by ear."
2,Not the Best...,You will have to improvise ALOT. I hated that the 2nd verse's vocal lyrics to sweet child o' mine were not musicaly anotated. It's different from the original. The Rollicking Piano Bar Songbook by Hal Leonard Corp. has that one song written out better.
2,Very Disappointed - rehash of old ideas,"As a long time marketing consultant, I found this book to be essentially a rehash of ideas that have long been explored/suggested by others. The first sections on personal and office appearance struck me as extremely dated given our current business climate and 'young' mindset. If you're new to marketing for a small business, I'd recommend Guerilla Marketing over this book by far.Part Four (Madcap Marketing) came as close to living up the the book's title and does include some good ideas and approaches, but not enough IMHO to save the book."
3,MC 5 - 'Thunder Express' (Munster Records) 3 1/2 stars,"Sort of raw-sounding,but a decent MC 5 compilation disc at that.As for the tunes I liked best,there's ""Borderline"",the title track ""Thunder Express"",""Looking At You""(one of my MC 5 favorites),""Kick Out The Jams"",""Detroit City Burning"" and a Stones cover that I don't believe I've ever heard them play,""Empty Heart"".Pretty much aimed toward MC 5 die-hards.It still would be okay for a new fan to check out."
2,Don't buy this until it's a lot cheaper...,"This game has way too many glitches. I wish I hadn't paid $60 for it!! It's fun, but the glitches are so annoying and consistent that it's not worth it. They should have waited to release it until they were fixed (I'm sure the testers had the exact same errors that everyone else is getting) and yet it was still released...the first Fable was much better, it had a few bugs but nothing compared to this. Every time I augment my weapon it doesn't work until days of gameplay later, and that is just one of the few things that bothers me."
3,Annoyances carry over that could've been easily fixed,"The movement is still glitchy, with villagers or the dog frequently blocking your way. I am very upset that there is no armor and the lightning magic is not as impressive or natural as it was in the first game, but the graphics are infinitely better. I really like the dynamic of the dog, but I wish that I could've picked it out myself, and like I said, he often gets in the way or gets injured. I'm not sure yet what happens if he dies or if he even can die.From what I've seen so far, Fable 2 is going to be a spectacular game, but the lack of significant improvements to the inventory menu, character movement, and glitchy villagers brings down my score to 3 stars. I mean, at one point the woman in the hood repeated herself like 9 times. Perhaps they will issue a patch via xbox live, but in this day and age such blatent glitches are inexcusable."
3,"Fun, but over hyped.","This is a fun game. That doesn't mean that it is revolutionary (it's not) or perfect (it's REALLY not). Fable II's premise is similar to the first Fable every choice has a consequence, be careful what you do it may come back to h... sorry I just dozed off there for a second. Anyway it's set 500 years after the first, times have changed heroes are no longer needed. You are the great, great, great, great grandsomething of someone who was special. Yes it is that cliched. The story actually gets better as it goes along though. The combat is fun but gets repetitive. The money system in this game is broken, gold is almost useless. You can buy practically everything. It's a fun game to play through once. The BIG problem I have with it is you are never fully immersed in the story. You will always feel like someone watching from afar. It is a good game, has great artwork, but the story just doesn't do it for me."
3,Could've been a great game....,"Fun to play but...Controls,accuracy,and timing of attacks,are downright awful at times...Just moving around in certain areas can be a chore...I hate the fact that blocking,light attack,and strong attack,are all one button...I just gave up blocking all together...But the most annoying thing...Is that you literally have to hold in a button,to collect your XP,after defeating a foe.Mind you...When facing many foes at once,you will take alot of hits,trying to collect your XP,before it disappears...How lame is that?Also the dog will get in your way alot when exploring tight areas.This game could've been great,but was obviously rushed...Kinda like the Xbox 360 altogether.(being on my fourth one).And already experiencing problems with it also..."
3,Works but freezes alot,i really wanted to play this game but it just freezes on me a lot so i just stopped playing it and gave it away so someone else who just bought a 360 maybe they will have more luck with it. im thinkin its just me thow i suspect there is a small percentage of people that do experience this problem. cant say if the game is great cause i haven't really gotten the chance to play it but just from the beginning quests it seems like an ok game. the menus seem slow and clunky at times...there are a couple glitches in the graphics now and then but its fable 2. if you played fable and lost chapters and loved it then buy this game.
3,Fun Game,"The game is fun and interesting, but they released it way too soon with too many glitches. Personally I would keep playing if only because it kept me amused but the ending was very anti-climatic and like I said you are constantly worried over glitches."
4,"Amazingly fun, but early glitches and bugs keep it from being great",Pros- Lots of ways to get side tracked- More rubust action than Oblivion- easy to get into- Mini games are addictive- Co op is pretty funCons- Bad glitches can ruin the game- could have had better camera angles- too easy to get distracted sometimes...- Menu system is a little more unweildy especially using spells
1,Game Ending Glitch,"After playing an enjoying the game for 8 days, the game froze up. The game is not playable now and I can not finish the game. I would not suggest that you buy the game as many other people have reported the same problem. The game developers have not acknowledged the problem, and there is no fix in sight.Update: My xbox 360 will not turn on this morning. I am almost certain that it was caused by Fable II. I would urge you not to buy this game until the issue has been addressed."
1,Other than the game-breaking bugs it's pretty fun.,"I loved this game for about 10 hours. Great music, graphics, gameplay, etc. Then I hit a bug that has rendered me unable to advance the story. Please read the other reviews, I'm not the only one. If I could actually complete the whole game, I'd give it a 4 or a 5. However, because my purchase essentially turned itself into a $60 extended demo, I can't give it anything more than a 1."
2,fable II,"Fable IIThe game over all was a good concept,think it was pushed out rather quickly and you can tell.There were a lot of glitches in the game,there were no ""big Bosses"".and for a rpg,there were no real challenges other than finding all the gargoyles.Took no time to beat,and one shot kill on the final guy was very lack luster!I did like the interaction with towns folk think it was better than fable ,Not enough items to get ,and there were limitded special weopons,,,and absolutly hated the fact there was no armor.I thoght the addition of a female cahracter was cool but as she grew in strength she turned into a big fat mess!!not cool!!I do not think it was worth the 63 bucks i paid for it and was dissapointed after the build up was so large!!I hope the next Fable will keep the same concept but improve on the things i've mentioned"
4,"Fun, Easy, But Has Some Bugs","For the beginner gamer, this game is great. Learning to use weapons is instinctive, and the story is interesting and fun. However, the game does have some bugs. I spent over an hour (in total) stuck under bridges, in caves, and in water, and so did my dog. Especially my dog! That said though, the story is well written and one can get genuinely attached to the characters. I enjoyed playing this game several times different ways, and although fighting with weapons wasn't particularly difficult, being able to use several weapons at once was very fulfilling."
4,"Good or bad, you decide.","This game is entertaining, especially with the choice options. You can choose to be bad, good, or somewhere in-between. Not for minors. There can be sexual situations (hetero- and homo-), obscene gestures, and alcohol consumption. Players choice, of course."
4,Fable 2,I never played the first Fable due to not owning tghe origional xbox but I figured I would tried this game since I was always intrested in trying it. Its a very fun game with an intresting story. The game itself is pretty easy with fighting. I actually found more fun trying to buy everything and get the best equipment.However when it gets time to want to beat the game there isn't much of a challange. Its fun and intresting but thats it and the end was very anti-climatic. I was expecting a good fight and it was just talking so i was very disapointed in that but even with the end not being great I still enjoyed this game and would recomened it to anyone intrested.
5,"Great story, great fun, even if a bit rough","Absolutely adore this series. First one I played and I was hooked. Fable 3 is just as good but with more adventure twists.Cons:May not look as amazing as other console gamesCharacter may seem stiffPros:So fun it's ridiculous, hours of playYou feel fulfilled when you complete itGreat story, love the Reaver a bit too much)Worth playing, don't know why reviews are so harsh."
1,read this,i love this game but when i bot a new copy from here they sent me an open box with no promotion code in it. Do NOT BUY FROM HERE
1,Typical gross trash,"It has about half an hour of good art, then the rest is trash. You're with prostitutes, ect. Gross, I want to throw up. I wish we could launch a boycott of these games until they make some that are actually worth buying and playing. Bring back the old PC games of the 80s."
4,A defintiate purchase,"This is a graphically beutifal game with many intresting abilities, wepons, spells clothes ect its plot although short is quite intressting.You have many choices throughout the game and it has a honour system. I would strongly avise that you dont go on killing sprees as you tend to end up having evreybody runnng away from you.However once completed fable 2 can quickly become boring."
2,Not for me.,"The movement is a little odd for my taste,and the characters look a little too cartoon for my liking.Others might like it though."
1,no dlc,Don't buy this one. it's a waste of money and tbh with dlc this game is shit compared to fable one.
2,"Fun game, but way too short","This game was fun while it lasted. I loved the freedom and the unique RPG elements. You can buy real estate, own a store, get married, have kids, get a job, etc. However, it really doesn't last long enough if you go for the main quest. The flow of the game is interrupted during the main quest, which I didn't care for. I would recommend the game as a rental."
1,Extremely disapointed,"If you are looking to get into the business of Beta Testing or Quality Control, then look no further than getting this game. The goal of Fable II is obviously to see how many bugs, glitches and piss poor coding you can spot, and believe me, there are many.It is unfortunate that a game that promises so much, and has an incredible art style, is technically flawed beyond belief. Common issues have ranged from game ending freezing, graphical glitches, loss of experience and attributes, shoddy co-op camera control, and loading issues. This wouldn't be such an issue if the programmers would have allowed the user to have multiple saves, which of coarse they don't.Fable II was one of my 3 must have games of the year, too bad it has turned into the worst gaming experiences in the past 3."
2,Decent with major flaws,"I just finished Fable II and I'd like to say my overall impressions were that of disappointment. While it is lighthearted and fun at times there are too many flaws that far outweigh its fun factor. Menus are poor both in game and out. The game occasionally freezes and co-op is a struggle. Load screens take extremely long and the repetitive game play forces the player to endure the load screens frequently.The game is extremely easy. Even in the unlikely event you actually die. You will most likely simply revive immediately with only a scar on your face as a consequence. Gold is simple to obtain, which makes getting items unfulfilling. There are loads of treasure chests and dig spots, but 95% of them are only good for selling and really benefit you in no way.My girlfriend and I both played this game through to the end and a good portion of it was fun, but I would certainly warn anyone before buying it themselves."
3,pretty - but not as good as the origional,"I played most of the side quests, even achieved the title kingPros:* kinda fun while it lastedCons:* Short game* way too easy. I maxed out force push early on and had no competition* Weak, uninteresting plot* Characters turn into zombies* no point in buying property, you can't buy anything much better than what you pick up along the way"
3,Fable 2 ....too bad for the bugs!,"Fable 2 is fun to play..great graphics. Too bad Lionhead left so many bugs in the game. Freezing issues abound for many making the game virtually unplayable. Great concept, poor design."
3,Waste of time,"Good game until the end. the end boss dies in 1 shot, the 3 choices are dumb and the final reward ... give me a break."
3,WAY TOO SHORT,I am a huge fan of the fable series. Coming off fable and fable the lost chapters. This game at its best was only mediocre. It lacked depth like its previous. Yes the graphics were better and the game had a dog as your pet. But thats about all it had. Game was too short way too short. The magic spells wernt anywhere near as many as the original fable. I was expecting much much more from this game. Character customization isnt all that original. Yes you change as you grow to look more and more demonic or more holy but its only really sudal changes. The addition of family and children is a nice new thing but its subpar. Buying property and getting gold by doing jobs is fun and rewarding when your wallet starts bulking up regularly. All and all i can only reward this game with 3 stars siting that its way too short and lacks the gameplay and complexity of the original.
3,Letdown,"Way too short, way too easy. Too easy to collect gold, hack-n-slash with little thought and almost zero chance of dying. The story is way too simplistic with very little character development (and I'm not talking about the main character). This game was a big let down as I really enjoyed the first one. I packed this one up real fast after beating it twice as there is little replay value. It is a renter is anything."
2,Not Really all that good.,I love RPG's But this game like number 1 and 3 really just is not my cup of tea. Rent it or watch some video's of the game online before picking it up. But if you liked Fable 1 you may like it.
2,Awesome game with problems,"This game is really captivating. However, it comes with major issues as it freezes up randomly. I cannot even get the game to start anymore. If you're willing to take the risk, get it, its awesome.UPDATE: After creating a new character, the game ran fine. There must be an issue with game saves getting corrupted."
5,Fable 2 is FUN,"I picked up this game last night and sat down to play for 1 hour. I looked up at the clock at it was 1:30 am, and I didn't want to stop! I had played 4 hours.This game is really fun. The game's world seems real and has lots of potential game play. You can marry several spouses, work many jobs, and go on lots of quests -- or just become a bandit!A+, 5 stars, 10."
4,Good Game,This game is especially fun because you can still have fun playing it long after you have beaten the main portion.
3,"Descent game, but too linear and simple","After playing the original fable, I was hoping for a great game with several choices, since the original fable you can make choices in the game that change the overall outcome.Not in fable 2, your choices change your appearance and the people around you (which are lifeless btw, they never really talk to you), and that's about it. NOthing else int he game is affected in the story at all. Lame. Was expecting a true sequel with many options that change as you go.Instead , play fallout 3, definitely changes the story as you go, and gives you more options to toy with."
2,fable 2 freezes all the time,"I got fable 2 and downloaded the post release patch. This causes the game to freeze at random parts of the game. It happens every 5 to 60 minutes and you have to restart the game and it is very annoying. This is a reoccurring problem for many fable 2 owners and Lionhead studios has done nothing to address it. Besides this, the gameplay isn't bad, but the storyline sucks worse than fable 1 and it is way to short. It seems like nowadays most game developers choose to put most of their time into graphics and whatnot instead of basic hardware and storyline to make a good game. Bottom line, save yourself some time and don't buy this game."
4,Gifted to Grandson,"This was a gift to my grandson, and he and his sister can't stop playing it. They love it. Maybe I should have been giving games instead of books all along."
4,fun game,this is a great game. A definite upgrade from the previous.......just wish I knew when the $10 gift card was coming
5,Great for girls too!,"My husband is a big RPG player. Unfortunately, most of these games are single player which means hours of him staring at the video game while I try to find something to entertain myself. Fable 2, however, has a co-op mode that we can play together. You are able to share experience and money between players too. Also great to play alone. There are lots of fun side projects and tasks besides the main story line. Awesome game. Don't buy it if you have other things to get done-highly addictive!"
2,Hyped Up,"This game is fun, I'll give it that and the story is decent. It is not a game you can play more than once or twice. The length is really short and it will be probably better to rent or wait till it is used and the price drops more."
1,"Fun, for a while...","I got this game the first day it came out. I played it for a few days and it was great. The graphics were good and the combat was good. Then as I was loading a region, the game crashed. Now I can't continue playing the game. At first I thought that it would be patched soon, but after 3 weeks that is not the case. I know many people that have had their xbox's break because of this game. This is terrible and I encourage everyone to never buy another Lionhead game again.Bottom line DO NOT BUY THIS GAME"
1,Crippling Bugs Mar Possibly Fun Game,"This game auto-saves and has only one available save slot. I was about ten hours in when my console crashed during an auto-save, and now I have lost all my progress.The gameplay that I saw seemed fun, but this deliberate and blisteringly stupid design decision has rendered the game unplayable for me. I have no interest in cringing every time the save icon appears. Do you?I'm taking this game back and waiting for Fallout 3."
5,One of the best fantasy role playing games.,"The main game quest should have been longer, but I love the side missions, DLC, and the customization of your character and how he or she acts, looks, etc. A great game! and just to note.. I dont give that type of rating out lightly."
1,Can't read the text at top of screen,"Wasted money on this game since I can't read any text at the top of my poor standard def TV. Unless you have one of them fancy new TVs that allows you to modify the screen/display settings, don't buy this game. It was poorly tested despite the claim by Lionhead that they did indeed test it on all TV types. I'm holding my breath for a patch and then maybe I can play it for another 2 minutes and then find another problem. I couldn't return the game b/c ""nothing"" was wrong with the game. Nice."
1,A very big let down,"***THIS REVIEW MIGHT CONTAIN SPOILERS***I was VERY disappointed by this game after playing the original Fable. It's all gravy up until about 2/3 of the way through and then it gets incredibly repetitive and you're just fighting the same enemies over and over again. The end boss ""fight"" with Lucien was such a let down that it ruined the entire game for me. You build up your character for nothing, basically. I can't believe that they had the balls to put this game out with that ending. They probably thought that it would make you excited for the possible 3rd Fable but it really just makes you angry that you spent all this money for a sub par story line with no payoff whatsoever."
2,too short,"great animation, not enough content. this game too me about 4-5 hours to completely beat, and i am not a great game player. the main story is a very short sequence of quests. there are side jobs, but nothing significantly long. i think maybe the idea is to start over and play differently, but i can't be bothered to do that since i already know how the main story will end now. save your money, or maybe wait until this game is in the bargin bin."
2,Fable 2: Revenge of the Bugs,"I have played Fable 2 for a week now and I can see that at it's core it could be a good game. The dev's put a lot of time into creating a fun and interesting world. However, I have also noticed that the dev's probably did very litle if any testing of the game before it went to sale. There are numerous bugs that will ruin your game (i.e. you will not be able to make any progress in the game) as well as those that will make the game really annoying and not fun to play. Lionhead studios need to get rid of the people that made this game and get some people that know how to make a playable game. You are much better off buying The Elder Scrolls Oblivion if you want a really good fantasy RPG. If you really want Fable 2 wait a month or ten until the game is fixed and playable. In the mean time you could play Oblivion. I should also add that the story for Fable 2 is utter trash. It often makes no sense and feels like it was put in the game just to give the player a main quest."
2,Actually quite boring,"I really tried to give this game a chance but I got so bored of it. It is so mechanical and it portends to be sandbox but it really is not.Pros: graphicscons: boring. You just follow a yellow-lit path to next quest, click somne buttons and move to next quest. Actually the blacksmith job was the most exciting part of this game."
2,cartoonish rpg,"I was not a big fan of the original fable and didn't have high expectations for this one. In my opinion its actually somewhat worse.The storyline is unimaginative and mediocre at best. The endings suck and don't make alot of sense. The graphics are very cartoonish and it made it very difficult for me to get into the game. There is very limited choice in weapons, and no armor only clothing, most of which makes you look stupid. There are a handful of special weapons to acquire but they are very difficult to get or find, and they are not much better then weapons you can buy or make.You can marry, divorce, buy property and work jobs. You have a bunch of stupid emoticon type behaviors you can learn, that seem to have little purpose other then to waste time.Combat is pretty much hack and slash and the the diversity of foes is limited.Interaction with NPC's is limited and one dimensional. Its worth a playthrough, if you like rpgs, but not much more."
4,"Fun, but it could be better","Many years ago, when I played the first Fable I instantly fell in love with it. I thought it was great how you could affect the world and yourself by your actions. Fable 2 is no different. Its got a huge world and has the ability to keep you playing for hours. But there are some downsides. For the age of videogames we live in, you would expect games no longer to be glichy. This game it is redicuolus. I had the game for one day and the game had already frozen on me four times. I thought the disk was just scratched but the bottom was clean and after reading other peoples reviews it seems like I am not the only one.If not for the gliches I would have given this game a 5 out of 5 but the game keeps stumbling over itself."
4,Great game,Starts off slow but there is a lot to the story and you have even more freedom then in Fable one. The only negative is you don't get the shield from one.
3,"Delightfully Tacky, Yet Unrefined","Let me first start off by saying this game is very large and allows you nearly limitless possibilities. That being said, the game is too easy. You can finish the game too quickly and the game begins to lose its appeal too soon. The game's good vs. evil philosophy is relatively intuitive yet can become annoying as well.Recommendation: For fans of the first Fable this game is a must play. For RPG fans this game is only worth picking up for $20 or less as there are several better ones out there (notably Oblivion: Game of the Year Edition)."
5,"Hmm thought i already reviewed this product, anywho ill gladly do it again",This game works perfectly runs normal there is one glitch where i can't go back to lionhead isle but i hear that alot so it can't be from the dealer other then that and the case had a tiny tiny crack from delivery its in new condishion thanks
2,Frustrating Repetition,The first Fable I gave up on because I didn't like the game mechanics and the graphics were ugly. Now comes the second one and I waited a year to get it. I played through half of this game and NEVER have I been so frustrated with a game. I wanted it to be over and be done with it but I couldn't play it any longer. The combat is so repetitive and you can never block or have a fair fight with any enemies. Either you're getting hit from behind when you want to block and hit someone or you just massively take over the enemy. The voice acting is extremely annoying and fake sounding. I was planning on getting Fable III but forget that now. I have lost any hope for this franchise.
2,Child's game with a M rating,"I do not understand the concept of this game. I am a huge fan of RPGs, as a matter of fact it is the only genre I buy every game released in, at least for PC that is. I was long curious about this title, I did play the first, I didn't necessarily enjoy it but I didn't hate it either. This game picks up a similar vibe as the first. It is sort of a The Sims meets the Fantasy RPG world. The main problem is that the depth of the story is that of Harry Potter books. That is all well and fine but then at the same time the game receives a M rating because it has sex and drugs. Is this game for kids or is it for adults? The storyline is really just as cliche as the rest. I recommend going and picking up Dragon Age of Mass Effect and avoiding this. It's not the worst RPG ever but it is definitely the most overrated."
5,Awesome!!!,Fable 2 was an awesome game!!! Has my expectations for fable 3 set very high can't wait!!!
2,This could have been a much better game,"This is a game that is sort of like elder scrolls, but not as good. It has a somewhat interesting plot, the gameplay is enjoyable, and the quests are entertaining --but the maps SUCK! I never know where I am, because you just get this little map that changes depending on what region you are in and is nearly impossible to use. So basically you're stuck wandering around from place to place without any idea how to get around. The game does provide you with a glowing path to the next goal you've set, but it's not enough for you to ever get your bearings. I gave up on this one after about 10 hours."
1,Endless Errors,"There are so many glitches with this game it is ridiculous. So far I've had several key NPC's disappear, making quests imposable to finish and a troll monster become immortal; thus locking that character in the Crucible. On another character- I've had a spouse that will not die, respond, or move. You're faithful little ""companion"" runs through walls and floats above chests and (every time you dig), turns the dog the color of the ground its standing on. The dog also misses many chests or just sits in your way.The chat scenes and sequences are extremely slow and glitch as well. Some games the NPCs will finish what they need to say- and others they will simply stop in mid-sentence.Although I expect Peter Molyneux to lie through his teeth almost every promise he made turned into a false-hood.Buy the original fable-it is amazing. Stay away from this unfinished game there are better."
2,More glitches than quests...,"How do you take an amazing game idea and ruin it? Simple really, you do not test or prepare this game for commercial launch. Action RPG gamers will love this game... in the semi-distant future when patches for the extreme amount of glitches are finally released. Don't buy it now, odds are you'd have to abandon your time spent when your game hits an error that you can NOT correct. When fixes are available this will be an amazing game... Until then it's a waste of time."
2,Disappointed,"The beginning is too slow. I don't have the time anymore to play a game and hope it gets interesting. I loved the first FABLE, but I also found the beginning of that one to be slow. The same goes for this game. Too much time is spent running around doing stupid things. It should get more interesting faster! However, because I lost interest and stopped playing the game early on, perhaps it does get better."
2,Don't be Misled by the Jersey!,Unfortunately I thought I was ordering the same gloves I purchased last year and was disapointed upon receiving these. These are just thin cotton jersey (tee-shirt material) gloves and not the durable John Deere Gloves I had purchased before. These are for light garden work and not shoveling and raking! The color was faded in many places and it looked mottled - probably because it was and old pair - I bought it at discount.
3,Disappointed,"I have searched for a long time trying to find martini glasses that are the classic size (5-6 oz) instead of the enormous ones that are used now. No catalogs have them, and online they either come in boxes of 36 or are extremely expensive. I saw this set in a search outside of Amazon, but I was sent to Amazon to purchase it. (I couldn't find it when I later searched Amazon directly.) The original description (same manu., same item #) said the glasses had pulled stems. They do not. They are molded stems with a seam. Otherwise they are attractive and a good size (8oz. actually, but that's better than 10 or 12+), but having pulled stems matters to me and the information was false."
5,5 Stars is NOT enough!!!,This is an absolutely classic recording. As perfect as one record/CD can get. NOT ONE cut on it is less than great! No collection of Folk/Texas Folk/Alternate Folkc/Alternate Country... whatever name you want to call it ... is complete without this recording.. GET IT AS SOON AS YOU CAN.
2,Willis Allan Ramsey,"This is remake 30 plus years later of his album. Willis Allen Ramsey's voice has not stood the test of time. It will be a disappointment if you are expecting the orginal, which is what the cover seems to suggest."
5,totally fat,"If you lived in the San Francisco Bay area during the '70s, you might have listened to these songs on the mighty KFAT, the greatest radio station on the planet. Just as KFAT was happy to mix, say, John Coltrane and Johnny Cash, this album mixes a bit of just about everything. Sure, it's country...using guitar and cello (Angel Eyes) or soprano sax and accordion (Ballad of Spider John). Every cut is good, even that sappy thing that America recorded, and every one is unique. I am so gassed that this is back in print.--NJ"
2,This is not a remake!,"Contrary to what the previous reviewer wrote, this is not a remake, but a re-issue of the original glorious recording. This is, of course, a five-star record, but I gave it two so that I could post this correction next to the mistaken ""Bobby O""'s comments.Peace"
5,"""That ONE Willis Alan Album ...""","On the album ""New Connections"", Todd Snider pays tribute to Willis Alan in the song ""Vinyl Records"". Singing about the many piles of vinyl albums sitting on his floor, he mentions the ""piles and piles"" of Tom Petty, and ""that ONE Willis Alan album"" (check it out with a seach here on Amazon). Many years after the album, I saw Willis Alan open for Lyle Lovett, and somebody asked the inevitable question, ""Where is the second album?"" He replied, ""You know, there for a while, I thought I WAS working on a second album. Not that any major label shared that opinion ..."" Major labels, like the one who turned down the Beatles, saying ""guitar rock is dead""."
5,More than Muskrats,"If only there was a second album! My favorite folk/country/alternative singer-songwriter's album is now available on CD. Glad I found it before my cassette and album versions wore out. Not a bad song on this. Muskrat Candlelight, as an original, sounds good despite the over-played cover by the Captain & company. Spider John starts the CD off strongly and Northeast TX Women is great at the end and there is not a bad song between. Boy from Oklahoma is my favorite. The CD reminds me of canoeing with the friend that turned me onto it in the 70's."
1,No info,"Like all the rest of the ""Images"" series about minor league baseball, there are lots of photos and some text about the various franchises from the past. But if your a hard-core researcher, you can forget this book as well as others in the series.Like the others, there is no data on individual franchises, seasons, players or managers. There is no data on opening-closing dates, managerial change dates, et al.If you are a casual fan, this book and the series are fine. But if your a researcher, they are a waste other than looking at the photos."
2,Why re-sing the classics?,"Something's wrong here. Not completely wrong, just a little off. Then it hit me, these are new versions of her old songs! This Canadian album from 1996 starts with a strange version of Downtown and then it degrades from there. I would go with one of her other collections and avoid this one altogether. This will takes its place next to my other bad CDs I'll never listen to in my basement."
3,THESE ARE RE-RECORDINGS WITH SOME NEW SONGS,"These are not Petula's original 1960s recordings. They are from the late 1980s, when she re-recorded her old hits for a SECOND TIME in Europe(she had previously re-recorded them in the mid-1980s in Nashville). The re-recordings heard here are actually better than the ones from the mid-1980s (as heard on the album ""Give It A Try"" and many other European rip-off re-issues). The new songs ""Turn To Me,"" ""All My Life,"" ""We'll Still Be Friends"" and ""Colours"" are also quite nice. But the packaging here is not too great and has a misleading 1960s photo on the cover. But the price is right for collectors. A more complete collection of these late 1980s (with a few more tracks) can be found on Madacy label from Canada (""This Is My Song Album"")"
4,microphone mounts,Perfect for what I needed. I wanted to mount some wireless microphones on the wall. Placed the flange on the wall and affixed the microphone clips directly to the flanges. Would be nice if they came with a locking thumb bolt though.
1,Avoid,The threads for the male flanges do not fit the threads on a standard mic. Don't waste your time or money
1,Horrid,"I am Amanda Redding from Chicago, Ill. I must say, I find it plain wierd that people write 'tell all' books when they are Christians. But maybe Tracy Melchoir is hard up for cash? I so wish she had spent more time glorifying God instead of making a written record of all her sins. Someone please remind Tracy that once you're saved, your sins are tossed away as far as the east is from the west;they are no more. Yet she tells us them in sensational graphic detail. Why does Tracy and Susan Wales go fishing to reel them back and then serve it up for us to read? I bought this book thinking it would spiritually lift me, but it sank me. I am embarrassed for them both. By the way girls, I can recommend a good editor. You both need one! That's 2 hours of my life I'll never get back."
2,not what I expected,"This product works well at protecting the phone, but it is hard to get to the memory card if you need to remove it. Also the belt clip broke 2 weeks after I purchased it."
4,very helpful,i could not wait for this book to come once i ordered it...was not disappointed...i am cataloging my albums and this guide helps in a very big way
2,Old Edition of Goldmine Record Album Price Guide 3rd Edition,"I requested information from Seller as to which Edition they were selling and never got response. It turned out to be the 3rd Edition and the 5th is already out. Buyers beware: If a seller doesn't give you proper information---DON""T BUY FROM THEM!!!!!!"
4,where to share info to submit to book ???,"The book itself did come apart in 3 days at center near K a few pages came loose. However the info was super on variations and they included some nice organist this time. Very positive on info given, where can we send info on 30 to 40 question mark answers on Release dates i have the answers!!!"
3,GOLDMINE RECORD PRICE GUIDE,THE PRICE GUIDE IS OK BUT IT IS NOT REALLY THAT ACCURATE AS I HAVE FOUND MANY ERRORS AND THERE ARE LOTS OF ALBUMS THAT ARE NOT LISTED AT ALL.
3,Foward looking,This book gives the reader a look at what drove Tesla. He anticapated progress that would speed mans growth. It also gives a look into the beginings of our modern technologies.
1,Poorly Copied Work of Nikola Tesla,"Nikola Tesla is a remarkable visionary... unfortunately the Kessinger reproduction of his work is awful. The May 23, 2010, ISBN-10: 1161355774/ISBN-13: 978-1161355772 hardcover version of this book is a badly scanned copy of the Century Magazine publication, which can be viewed freely all over the internet. The Kessinger version literally looks like someone scanned a PDF copy of the document, faxed it, and then scanned it a few more times. Due to this, the text is extremely hard to read and all of the inspiring images have turned to black splotches. No effort in reimaging or restoring the work at all. The content is five stars, but this version is one star."
4,Amazing insight,"This book is amazing in the fact that it was written 100 years ago and the concepts he was putting forth then are only now beginning to be desired on the whole. Some of the predictions he makes are spot on. Some held up until maybe only 5 years ago. A few were totally off (that copper would become obsolete to aluminumb is the big one I remember) This is an amazing piece of inspiration, but it's a little too theoretical at parts in that certain logic gaps are not filled at all. I wouldn't recommend this unless you have an ability to understand a moderate level to physics, otherwise you'll find yourself getting lost and not being able to understand subsequent concepts."
3,Strange that the translator is not mentioned anywhere...,"This appears to be the Jowett translation. Why should the potential buyer not be provided with that information? It is truly weird to offer a translation without letting anyone know where it came from. Why hide it? It raises my suspicions when the origin of the text is withheld. It seems Amazon is awash with unattributed texts. I realize that many of these texts are now in the public domain--but then all the more reason to be honest. The cover photograph is appealing, but the font for the body of the text is a typewriter font--why?"
5,Calming,"No matter what kind of day I am having, I can always DEPEND on Grover to smooth out the wrinkles in it. The man IS a Master!..."
1,Prongs Are Not Rounded - Beware,"I never realized there was such a quality difference re: prong collars. The Herm Sprenger is, by far, the best. (I should not have tried to go cheap on this). The Guardian prongs are flat which prevents a smooth flow on fur. The rubber tips exacerbate this poorly designed collar."
2,Prong Collar,The Guardian Gear Prong Training Collar works effectively to prevent leaning on the leash during walks. This particular collar is so stiff that I had great difficulty separating the links to remove the collar from my dog. I had to substitute one lighter weight link for ease of removal.
1,Does not stay in place,"Every tutorial for this collar (and all collars) specifically states that they need to stay under the chin of the dog in order to work. This collar does not have a closure hook or clasp so it must be put on over the dog's head. Well, in order to get it over the dog's head, it has to be much larger than the neck. The collar slips down and does not stay in place and therefore cannot work properly. It should be made with some sort of a hook closure to put it on and off without going over the head... Won't work, it was a waste."
2,didnt help,"my 65lb German Shepherd still pulls. We no long use this collar. I bought a ""no pull harness"" and that works wonders. I'll be selling this collar at the Thrift Shop soon. Worthless."
4,It works like magic,"I have a very hyper Pug. He LOVES to pull. I placed this around his neck and he's just walking beside me now.I took one link off and it fits loosely around his neck until I tug on it.It's really hard to put back on him since you have to hook it back into place, and that's really hard with a hyperactive dog.Another thing I don't like about it is that the rubber pieces fall off and him and my other dog started chewing on it. I don't wanna take all of the pieces out because I know it's going to hurt a lot more.Either way, its cheap and it gets the job done. I'd buy a second one if this one broke.And to the people who's saying it fell part, you're probably using it wrong because it works just fine. And my Pug is WHITE. He jumped into the water with this thing on and there was no discoloration on his fur."
2,Hard to use,This item was not usable. No simple or easy way to unhook and re-hook. It wasn't clear if the rubber tips should be used with the chain or taken off. Needed to send instruction on usage. Sorry I missed the returned window. Live and learn.
3,Collar,"It is very hard to take the collar on and off. The prong covers came off right away, maybe they were just for shipping? Wish it had a quick release. But once on it works ok."
2,easily broke,"collar broke after a few wears, not very well made. need to replace after a few months of wear, better to buy a better made product"
2,Cheaply designed,"My parents have a similar collar like this one which works great. So great, I bought this one on Amazon. However, big warning, it FALLS apart. The metal is so cheap that the links literally come apart very easily. I would be scared to walk my dog down a busy street with this collar. This is a huge safety concern and I hope Amazon flags the product. BTW, I just received it today in the mail and I refuse to use it."
1,Falls off!!,This is disappointing. I have used the pronged collar before on other dogs I have had and they work great. This one works great when it isnt falling off! I put it on my dog and walked great after a few minutes she shook her head and it fell off. Tried again and the samething. Not good quality!
1,Keeps coming off my dog,"Like other people, I also experienced this collar popping off my dog. The links are not very secure and there is nothing more scary than walking your dog down a road and have the collar literally pop off."
1,not easy to use,"This prong collar is very difficult to use because it is hard to put it on and take it off. The prongs are difficult to squeeze to get it loose, even for my husband. Also, the little black prong covers just come off and get lost. I would recommend getting a prong collar with a release, and that is what we ended up doing. It is great!"
3,"Doesn't work as designed, but can be fixed","This collar will not work on my dog as designed. When the collar is adjusted to fit his neck properly it will not slide over his head. So my husband added a quick release snap to the collar. We also had to remove the rubber tips because they caught on my dogs hair. After making these changes and adjusting it to the proper fit the collar works well. I have a 120lb. male Anatolian Shepherd that is very headstrong. I'm a small 50 year old woman. Before getting this collar, my dog would pull away from me when I tried to get him to do something he didn't want to do, like get in a car. He doesn't pull at all now. I was concerned about using a pinch collar at first because it looks like a medieval torture device. However, I tried it around my own neck, without the rubber tips, before using it on my dog. There was no pain, only an evenly distributed pressure around my neck when it was tightened. After trying it on myself I had no qualms about using it on my dog."
2,Poor quality and too much work,"I bought this prong collar for a new puppy, I wanted a collar similar to the collar I used to train his mother. This is not it - although it sounded like it in the write up. This collar, once seperated to put on the dog, has a very real tendancy to come undone. Not something you want to happen with a puppy! I bought two of these collars so I would always have one with me (keep one in the car in case I need it when we are out.) I will be replacing both of them."
1,don't waste your money,"I purchased 2 of these collars for my two dogs; the dogs are about 35-40 pounds each. These collars do not stay closed. Several times my dogs have pulled and the collars have simply fallen off. The issue is that the prongs are made of weak metal, so they separate easily. It just happened again today during a walk along our street. One of my dogs took off in an unfamiliar area (to the dog) and was narrowly missed by passing cars. These are going into the trash to be replaced with stronger metal prong collars."
1,Harmful,"The problem with a prong collar is people keep them on the dog 24/7. It is mearly a training tool and the goal should be to have the dog work on the flat collar. Please don't use this unless you know how to use it. This device can cause nerve damage on your dog. See if you can find the book ""No bad dogs, no bad owners."
5,Prong Collar,This is a great product.Also the best customer service in terms of return and exchange.I rate them A+.
1,Don't waste your money,I bought this based on all the good reviews on Amazon. It didn't stop my 1 year old Lab from pulling. It's a waste of money.
3,"Inexpensive, okay quality, will rust","Quality is good enough - more or less what you expect for the price, maybe slightly better. The price is great.I suppose I shouldn't keep the collar on my dog when it's raining or when he goes into a stream, but the fact is I do and as a result there is some rust on the collar, exactly where you would expect it: where there's contact points between the metal and the chrome chips off."
2,too hard to attach,"I bought one Guardian prong collar, and one Sprenger prong collar for my 2 boxers. I wish I had bought 2 Sprenger collars instead. They are soooo much easier to get on and off the dogs. Should have known the Germans make the best products. :)"
1,Poor quality,Poor quality in this brand. The links dont go together smoothly and ive actually had this collar pop off of my dog a few times. I looked upi better made prongs and came across Herm Sprenger. They seem to be top of the line. WOrth then money and much happier with it!
4,Effective and humane!,"This collar is an effective and humane training tool. Please be advised that you will need strong fingers to ""pinch"" the prongs for putting the collar on and taking off. However, with more use, it does become more pliable. Also, please be advised that to walk your dog safely, attach a second leash to the other collar that your dog usually wears. One day I was walking my dog and hadn't secured the prongs carefully enough. The attachment came loose. The safety leash came in handy as it kept him from running out into the street. This collar only received 4 stars due to the fact the the metal is too rigid for my arthritic fingers. If used properly, this collar will help train your huge dog to walk obediently."
5,LIFE SAVER,"I have a very well-behaved Australian Shepherd but that was the issue... He is bred as a herding dog, so while training him to go on walks he sees everything and walks left to right, left to right, etc... As a young pup he would get excited when we encountered other dogs and would jump around wanting to play. I finally purchased the prong collar and he walks perfectly like the dog he really is! At first I felt it was cruel but it's just like having a mother dog pinch her pup's neck when they are ""acting out."" If you are having issues training your dog, you NEED this!"
5,30 minute workout that works,"I've purchased many video and DVD workouts, but I've never come across one like this. It's instructional, without being boring, offering three workouts that are a combination of resistance and flexibility exercises. Michael Stefano is easy to follow, and all movements are explained in detail. The pace is moderate, but not superfast, making it possible to keep up. I've been using the workout for about a month, and already see huge results.Thanks Captain Mike"
1,"unless you've NEVER exercised before, do not bother","Pace is too slow. Instruction is boring. Exercises do not amount to anything but the most *basic* of moves (squats, pushups, rows, bike situps, etc.). B/c the pace is so slow, absolutely no intensity to the workout. Plus the guy excudes absolutely no energy, making for an all-around poor purchase."
2,?,The video is very slow and boring. Not a good workout for a person training to become a Firefighter.
2,"Firefighters are great, but this dvd is not.","I use dvd's almost daily in my workouts, so I was really looking forward to a new one, but I was very disappointed when I got this dvd. The workout is very slow paced and the moves are very basic. Maybe for someone who is just starting a workout program this would be all right. Even the more advanced workout is pretty slow moving and not very challenging.The easiness of the workout is not the only thing that I don't like about this dvd, the instructor who I'm sure is a wonderful fireman, is not very good at directing you. He has a really monotone voice that is very boring. I guess that's what I found the whole video to be-- boring!"
3,Firefighter's Workout,"The item was purchased as a gift and reviewing it,it seems to be the ticket for my son to regain his healthy weight and tone."
2,Returned it and will try something else,"The few times I've bought exercise vids, I've learned to watch them first so I won't be surprised by the moves and I can see how intense the workout is. I don't think I even made it through this one because I was bored. Lots of video of firefighters. Lots of talking, when I'd rather be exercising (why do they think we buy these things?). Dull exercises I can do even without being in much shape. I would only recommend this program to those who are really, seriously, completely beginning with fitness."
1,Printed lies...,if you like fiction... you will LOVE this book. it is the farthest thing from truth and reality you can ever dream of. Best (Worst) Buy is going in the hole because of their poor customer service. this book fails to mention that there is a website (not blog... actual full-blown website) called bestbuysux.org that chronicles how horrible of a company they are by both customers AND employees! don't waste your money on this book of printed lies!
1,Don't waste your money,"I completely agree with D. roszkowski ""book m. dano"". If you've read about the millions of horrible experiences that customers have had to deal with when it comes to Best (Worst) Buy, you would never step foot in one of their stores again. They have to get one of the worst retailers that exist now and hopefully, they'll be going out of business soon.Save your money and don't waste it on this book or any book that supports this company."
5,The Ethereal voice of Kiri!,"It has been said that all the great composers spent their lives trying to reach heaven, but that Mozart came from there. Well, in the ""Vesperae Solennes De Confessore"", Mozart takes the liberty of escorting us there. And as we sublunars stand inside, privileged, under that magnificent vault listening to the music of the heavenly spheres - his music! - we are increasingly rendered awestruck and by the end of ""Laudate pueri"", mute as well. Understanding our condition, he then leads us to a small anteroom of heaven to listen to a choir of angels sing the ""Laudate Dominum"" before escorting us back through the gates to the music of the ""Magnificat"". Davis and Te Kanawa take us on this journey. It is a magnificent recording!"
5,Sad & Joyful,"This book brought tears to my eyes. I was saddened regarding the unhappy early life that Mr. Sagmiller went through, yet I was very happy for his success in his later life.I have an adult son who is dylexic, and the ongoing pain he has gone thru, and continues to go throuh, has constantly torn at my heart. I have kept in touch with Mr Sagmiller and he has been very helpful and supportive. He seems to be a gem of a human being and I have been very fortunate to have communicated with him. I hope my son, and I, can meet with Mr. Sagmiller some day.If you know of someone who is dear to your heart who has been thru the pain and the anguish of dyslexia, you might want to consider either giving them this book or getting the tapes of this book for them. The tapes can be purchased on Mr. Sagmiller's website. I highly recommend this book."
5,WoW,I must say that I am very glad that I read this amazing book. It told me that I am not alone. Sometimes you will get a good book like this. This author knows his stuff. It was almost as if I felt his pain. I am so glad that he took the time to write this book. This is a great gift for anyone that wants to know more about this subject.
5,Beautiful Christmas music,"A beautiful, classic combination of saxophone and piano with some light percussion. Relaxing, gentle Christmas music (no vocals)."
1,Problem with this item,"I made an order for two of these items. My confirmation e-mail from Tech Depot stated that the item in question is actually a ""Wireless Keyboard for LE1600 & LS800 series"". Don't order this expecting a tablet PC."
5,Clear beautiful voice and the most gorgious music,After listening to this most inspirational music I read the life of the artist and found that to be equally inspiring.
3,nice reference,"This book makes nice reference material. If you are really into NASA, and Apollo in particular, as I am, you will really like this. I have not seen material quite like this elsewhere, therefore I feel that this is definately something to read. I only give three stars because I was disappointed in the included CD and I think there was a missed opportunity to elaborate throught the book. The CD mainly contains a rather lame interview with Aldrin and mpegs of surface activities. I wish landing related video had been included on the CD."
1,Dissapointed,"This book was not what I expected. There are interviews with the astonauts printed in question answer format. Makes quite a dull read, and comes accross as some publisher trying to earn a few dollars without much effort. Pity, as Apollo 11 surely was one of man's boldest accomplishments."
2,DIdn't work...,"I bought this thing hoping it would work with my Samsung TV, Apple TV, and Panasonic upconverting DVD player. Unfortunately, when it arrived, I was never able to get it to work. Two problems with it:1. My Samsung TV, with its auto-sensing ports, didn't even ""see' that the switch was plugged into it. Neither Samsung or Audiovox/Terk's technical support was able to assist with this.2. If I jimmy rigged it (swapped my HDMI cables on the TV, so the TV was set to the source that the switch was plugged into) I could get video through my DVD player, but the Apple TV never worked.In the end, I returned it, and ended up buying the XtremeHD switcher. It touts being compatible with the Apple TV, and, despite reviews that it didn't work with Samsung TV's, I took a risk. It ended up working great!"
2,Kinda works,"I got this item because Terk has some decent gear and the price was right at the time. I hooked up my Xbox360 and PS3 and the Xbox360 worked perfectly. The PS3, however, had TERRIBLY degraded. I swapped HDMI cables, etc and still had the same issue. So this DOES NOT appear to work with PS3."
1,is not auto switch,I have a viewsat hd sat box and a sony 1080p dvd player it dosen't go enywere I have to do it manualy
1,DOES NOT WORK!!!!!!!,"I needed this switch to hook my Toshiba HD-DVD Player, my Comcast HDMI cable box and HDMI-DVI PC to my LG 29"" 1080 HDTV. The only thing that worked was the cable box and the switch downgraded the signal to my TV to 480 which isn't any better than the DTV signals. I tried turning everything off and then on again with each individual unit and still had the same result. Do your research before purchasing this product as I didn't and wasn't aware of HDMI hadshaking and HDMI-DVI compatabilites with the PC."
2,Expensive manual switch,I have all recently purchased equuipment but the switch only automaticallty switched one time and has not switched automatically since so I use it as a manual switch
1,doesn't automatically switch,"This product would not automatically switch between my cable box and my DVD player. Even if I turned both off, then powered up one of them, it would not select that component automatically. I don't know if the problem was the Motorola cable box, the Toshiba HD-DVD player, the Dell TV, or the HDMI switcher itself, but it wouldn't work for me."
3,"1080i only, not 1080p, hopefully it's a bad unit","The auto switch works very well, you don't need to switch a component off before switching to another. If the switch senses another device being turned on then it will switch to it. To go back to the original device though, you would have to turn off the 2nd device.The biggest problem I had with it was even though the box claims it will pass 1080p signals, it didn't for me, as I had to change everything down to 1080i for it to work. I will be getting a replacement, and see if I just got a bad unit."
2,"Works well with some devices, will not switch with others","This product works well with some devices, but will not switch correctly all the time. Switching will only occur cleanly when one device stops sending a signals to one of the inputs and another starts. When I use my universal remote to switch between the Dish Network DVR and the DVD player, I get a ""sleep"" screen from the DVR and the Terk does not switch to the DVD input. If I turn everything off for a second or two and then turn on the devices I want to use it all works OK, but that is more hassle than I will deal with. I don't think this is a problem with the Terk, just a limitation of any switch that relies on auto-detecting signals on the inputs.I am swapping the Terk for a switch that has a remote instead of auto switching. I can program the remote codes into the universal remote and all should be good."
2,Doesn't quite work as advertised,"This HDMI switcher doesn't quite perform like you'd hope. We hooked it up to our new Pioneer 5010FD with a 15ft HDMI cable and used another 15ft HDMI cable to hook it up to our PS3 at 1080p. It would not display ANY picture when set to that. We tried another 8ft cable and got a picture at 1080p, but white dots would appear and disappear at random, ruining the picture. We couldn't get any 1080p picture when using the switcher with a 6ft cable and our Xbox 360 running at 1080p. I finally tried it with an upconverting DVD player running at 1080i and got a picture just fine. Be very wary with the lengths of your cables if you plan on using this device at 1080p."
3,Automatic switching isn't for everyone...,"I ordered this switcher but it doesn't quite meet my needs. It works great as an manual switch, but beware if you're set on the automatic switching mode. Not all devices terminate the HDMI link when you power them off (such as my TiVo). If you have a device that doesn't terminate the link, this switch won't switch back to it because it triggers based on the inactive-to-active state change of a connection. For example, I put my TiVo on input 1 and my DVD on input 2. When I turn on the DVD, it switched to input 2 as desired. However, turning the DVD off and the TiVo back on DID NOT switch back to input 1 because the TiVo never terminated the HDMI link and therefore didn't trigger the switcher. Bummer. I wound up ordering the 4-port Hdmi Switcher Box w/ Remote Control (1 Year Warranty) instead which solves my problem by using its remote control."
1,DirecTV users beware,Just boxed the switch up to ship it back. I am a DirecTV user and I have an HR20 HD DVR that will not pass through the switch. My DVD player works fine through the switch. My HR20 works fine connected directly to the HDMI port on the TV but when I connect the HR20 through the switch the HR20 crashes and has to be uplugged to reboot it.Bottom line is that the switch seems to work OK as long as you don't have an HR20. I have seen others having this problem as well after researching this online.I have also read of others using a different switch and the HR20 seems to work fine. Just placed the order for a different brand switch that I have read works for the HR20.
1,BEWARE !! Will not work with Direct TV HR20 HD receiver,"I purchased this product from Amazon and was sold by ANT Tech. Switch will not work with a Direct TV HR20 HD receiver, it will not recognize the unit.Therfore will not switch over. Audiovox sent me 4 replacements before they admmited that it will not work with Direct Tv.I am thinking that a large number of direct tv customers might consider purchasing this HDMI switch, I am here to tell you do not buy it or you will have the same problems that I had. The company ANT Technologies (seller of product) is a poor company. They do not have a customer service number and WILL not return you E-Mails.Thank god that Amazon.com is a reputable company, they gave me a full refund in a very short period of time. So my advice is to not purchase this switch and run and do not look back if what you are buying comes from ANT Technologies."
4,Works as advertised,I have a HD-DVD player and a PS3 connected to the switch. The auto switching has been working fine even without having to power the other machine first. It would be a five star if it had a power button.
1,You get what you pay for,"I should have known better but I ordered this because of the low price. Its ability to auto switch was intermittent and it would not pass dolby digital signals throught the HDMI. Tech support was useless and suggested that I return the box for a new one that should work. Instead a bought a Radiient for more money, but it worked perfectly out of the box."
3,Does not work with PS3,So we bought this thinking it would be a huge help with our entertainment center gadgets and to my hubbys dismay he tried over and over again but to no avail.. will not work with our PS3.. the xbox 360 picked it up fine and works perfectly but the ps3 is a complete no go.
3,HDMI switch,"The switch is fine, however I chose to not spend the extra cash on a remote.It is NOT an automatic switch. I have to get up and push the button every time.Spend the extra cash on a remote."
4,Auto doesn't work w/ Comcast/Motorola DVR...,"As quite a few people stated, the auto select part doesn't work properly w/ device like Cable DVR. Indeed, I read those review before getting one. In a a sense, I expected it.For the money I paid + there's enough people warn me ahead of time about the 'Auto Select', I think it still deserve a 3 - 4 stars. Oh... there's no 3.5, OK... Let's make it 4, what the heck. :-)"
2,Caution,"The switch itself is fine. The problem is that too many components do not recognize it or that the switch doesn't recognize them, I don't know which. I wind up having to change the channel manually."
2,Good item but did not work with my dvr and bluray.,"A good idea that works on manual, but I paid extra for the automatic switching properties.. I wish they had just said that this will NOT work with dvr, which I guess are on all the time, I would have bought a manuel switch.. I will keep it but it did not live up to my expections.."
2,Doesn't work with everyone,I bought the Terk HDMI Switch to hook up my Direct TV box and my LG DVD player to my TV. It would only work with the Direct TV. I couldn't get the LG to show up on my tv while hooked up to the switch (manual or auto). Now it's a paper weight.Terk HDMI-31 Smart HDMI Switch (3 X 1)
1,Junk Switch,"I'd read this switch has problems in auto mode, but I wasn't worried--I was OK with manually switching between my three devices. Unfortunately, it didn't function in auto or manual mode.Device #1: VIP622 DishNetwork receiver: worked fine.Device #2: Panasonic Samsung BD P1400 BluRay player: worked for a few seconds then black screenDevice #3: Roku Netflix player: worked for a few seconds, then green screen.I tried different cables and different configurations, to the same result.This device is junk. Returned to Amazon."
3,Not all it's cracked up to be,"While the product provides an acceptable solution as a manual switch, the auto function does not work. I bought two of these switches, thinking that an auto switch function would be terrific. Perhaps Terk needs to address the satellite boxes that never completely lose power, therefore it never actually stops emanating signal. While I'm sure that if I had two DVD players and a PS3, it would work great, it doesn't come through in the real world. Still, the switch works well manually."
4,HDMI switch,"I had this for about a month now, and I'm reasonably happy with it. The picture is good; I can't see any degradation even though I've got 6' hdmi cables on each side of the switch. I already had them, thought I'd give them a try, and it's working out fine. My only complaint is that while it'll automatically switch to my DVD, it won't automatically switch back to the DVR box, no matter how I fuss with it. However, that's a minor inconvenience for me, so I'm still pretty happy with the unit. The price was great, and I simply only switch from the DVR to the DVD infrequently. The switch is definitely handier than switching the inputs on the plasma."
3,One worked great the other didn't,"I got 2 of these. I have 2 TV's one in the family room and one in the master bedroom. Each setup is exactly the same; DirecTV HDMI DVR and HDMI DVD Palyer plugged into Terk going to Sony HDMI in. The setup in the family room works great. The auto-switching works if you make sure you turn off each device when your not using it. It then senses the active device and switches to that input. The Terk in the master bedrooom didn't work. It would pass video thru from teh dvd player but no audio. It wouldn't pass anything thru from the DVR. In fact, I thought the dvr went bad until I realized that the Terk was the problem."
1,Does not work!,"The video switched with no problem. But, the audio did not come through. I tried using different HDMI cables, but no luck. I returned the product for a refund. Do not buy!"
2,Doesn't work with my Dish HD DVR,"It seems to do its auto switching thing just fine, but passes no picture from my Dish Network HD DVR. It also seems to screw up the DVR, forcing me to power-cycle. I think the switcher is basically a good product, but with reviews here stating a simlar experience with DirectTV DVRs, it seems like they are missing something that makes up a lot of their target audience. I am returning this."
1,Don't buy this,"I bought this through amazon and used to connect it to my PS3 DVD and TV (all Sony products. After a month the picture became snowy and it no longer switches automatically. I had to send it back to Audiovox through UPS ($14) because they will not accept it through regular mail. (Audiovox owns Terk. They recieved the switch Jan 22, 2008 and untill now they have not sent me a replacement. Called them several times, first they don't know why I have not received a replacement, 2nd they cannot find in their system if the replacement was sent, 3rd they said it was on back order and will send it in April. It's been 2 months!!!! DON'T BUY ANY AUDIOVOX PRODUCTS, THEY ARE WORTHLESS!!!"
2,Doesn't auto-switch,"The manual switching works, but after about an hour of messing with it, I gave up on the auto-switch. I have a Time Warner HD cable box and an RCA DVD player.From experimenting with it I learned:If I unplug an active HDMI cable and move it to another port, the unit will switch to the new port. It will also pick the correct port if the power cord is detached and re-attached. Hardly auto-switching.I will probably keep the unit because I can live with manual switching (not that lazy). I am just using it for video, so I don't know if the sound works or not, as others have complained about the sound.If you are looking for smart switch, look elsewhere because this unit doesn't live up to its marketing."
3,Unable to switch DirecTV HD receiver not fault of switch,As another reviewer had mentioned this switch will switch a DirecTV HD receiver off automatically when another unit is turned on but will not switch back on. This is due to a locked link from product being switched. I found this out by manually unpluging the HDMI DVD player from the back of the switch and then it would switch back to DirecTV HD receiver. I would also recommend a switch with a remote and then with a Harmony remote you can intergrate the commands in the activities section of the online software.
1,Did not work with my DirecTV HD DVR!,"I have a LCD TV with only one HDMI input so I purchased this product to connect my DVD upconvert player and HD DVR into one input without switching cables every time I would switch from one to the other. The auto switching worked great! It did what it says, when you turn on your source, it switched to it automatically. But I could not get a picture from my DirecTV HD DVR! Sound-yes! Picture-no! I also had to keep changing the resolution back to 1080i on my DVD upconvert player because for some reason it would switch back to 480i when using this auto switch. I would not recommend this product!!"
1,Doesn't Work (As Advertised),"It doesn't work with my system, as least not as advertised. It will automatically switch from my Samsung (HL-R4266W) TV to my Sony (DVP-NS75H) DVD player, but will NOT automatically switch back to my DirecTV (H-20) receiver. I'm very upset that I spent the money for what is essentially a manual switch.CORRECTION: After some experimentation, it seems that the TV and DVD player lock-up the link. I'm not sure which is the culprit. It turns out that if I turn off the TV and the DVD Player for the time that it takes for the TV to totally power-off (thus severing the link) I can turn on the TV and DirecTV and everything is fine!"
2,auto switching works great. does not support 1080p output,This product seemed to work great at first but does not function correctly with any components set to 1080p. In this case i hooked up a samsung bluray player and xbox360 and each would flash static and there would be a popping sound coming from the speakers every few seconds. Once i set each device to only output at 1080i or less (had to set the bluray to 720p) this problem was resolved.This unit does not work as advertised so i returned it but if you are looking for 1080p support i would stay away from this particular switch.
1,Only 1 of 3 outputs worked,"My issues with this device weren't related to it's compatibility with specific devices. The unit I got just simply didn't work. I hooked it up to the TV and then attached the DVR to port 1. The signal going to the TV would flash on and off every few seconds. After double checking all of the cable connections, I decided to try the other ports on the device.When I connected the DVR to port 2, the signal was flawless. When I tried port 3, it had the same issues as port 1. So I know it wasn't the DVR and it wasn't a cable issue. Only 1 of the 3 output ports functioned properly, so I'm returning the unit. Maybe the one I got just happened to be defective."
1,BEWARE - Does not work with latest HDMI items - Junk!,"Beware...I bought this product and it has serious compatibility issues (thing called HDCP - Copyright) and wont work with simple items - PS3, Roku Netflix box, Samsung Blu Ray player, Vudu Digital Player. The only thing it was compatible with was Apple TV which didnt help me much since I bought this to work as an entended Hdmi port system. The screen flashes and goes blue or green with many of these items and I was totally fooled by the price of this gadget. It is junk and I returned it immediately. I ended up buying another Xtrememac 4 port HDMI switcher..since I had experinece with them before and they are compatible with all items. Dont bother with this garbage."
3,about what you would expect for the price,"I bought this product to run a panasonic blu-ray player, HD DVR DirectTV box, and PS3 through. For the first few days, seemed to work great. But then, the auto-detect feature, where it automatically switches to whichever source is powered up, quit working. Now, whenever I want to change the source, I have to get up and walk to the TV and punch a button on the box. The only reason I forgive this issue enough to still give 3 stars is because the other boxes cost so much more."
2,Another disappointed customer,"Well I got my switch over the weekend and did not work as advertised, it does not switch automatically as it should. I got 3 HDMI devices connected to the switch and the only way I can get it to switch is to disconnect the HDMI cable fromt the back of the switch, hardly what I had intended to do in the first place. I do not have any audio or video problems otherwise I will have it return ASAP. Manual mode works that is why I gave it another star, otherwise it would have been one. If you want a manual switch with some pretty lights, this one is for you. I may add that I tried every suggestion that I read with same results, only pulling the cable or turning the device off from the wall seems to work. Poor product."
3,Help,I am thinking of purchasing this switch. My question is:Is this thing HDMI 1.3 compatible? The video amplifier bandwidth is only 1.65 Ghz. Is this thing going to restrict the signal between my hdtv and HDMI cable? I know its important to use the highest performance cable you can afford so I don't want it to limit the passing signal in any way.
1,This thing makes me sad,Would not work with my dvd player. Would not auto switch. The people who sell this thing should be ashamed of them selfs. This is the worst waste of money I have ever spent money on!
1,unsatisfied,"the item never worked and when i went to the product site, the site didnt offer any answers as to why it didnt work"
1,Failed after one year,"Unit worked great for about a year and a half. I switched it to a different TV and it no longer switched at all automatic or manual. Money lost, currently purchasing another one without the features. Wish it was not too late to return."
1,don't buy this,"I bought this Terk HDMI switch for its low price. I got what I paid for. it did not automatically switch from sony bluray player to Cablevision box ( and vice versa). Worst of all, video signal was intermittent. DO NOT buy this product."
5,Great switch,I've had several other products that didn't work well. This one works extremely well. It does not degrade the picture. The automatic switching works as described. I'm pleased with this one.
1,Not compatable with Blu-ray player,"It switches fine, just as it's supposed to. I bought this switch at the same time I bought a new Samsung Blu-ray player. The player, when connected directly to the TV by HDMI, works beautifully, but when connected through this switch, presents a black image with static and audio that ""lurches"" forward. The switch, which has its own power source, apparently is feeding back into the player, causing it to malfunction. Whether it's the switch or the player that's at fault, who knows, but they don't seem to be compatible with each other. My other input source, a hi-def tuner, works okay with the Terk unit, but not the Samsung player. Rather disappointing."
5,Perfect Product,"I ordered the TERK HDMI switcher and I have to say that it has worked perfectly!!I have an LG Plasma, Time Warner HD Box and a Playstation 3. The switcher will go to which ever unit I turn on last. I don't have to worry about putting manually switching because it reads the newest unit to be turned on...everytime!!"
5,Super Deal,"Well I guess I can begin by asking why they Call BEST BUY, Best Buy? Amazon's price was $36 and BB's price was $99. The Switch did not work well in the auto-detect mode. But I am so happy not to have to switch cables between pieces of equipment. That manually switching them at a touch of my finger is not a big deal."
2,dissapointing,I bought this switcher because it said it automatically detects the source of the HDMI signal switches to that part. It doesn't do it with any consistencyI have to frequently get up and change the switch to the signal source. Nice idea if it worked sucks I have to manually do it myself.
3,Not that smart !,"The wonderous automatic Smart Switch as described works 'smart' when toggled manually between components. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad to have found it as I only have only (1) HDMI plug on my TV and (2) HDMI devices. And I don't mind the extra exercise so no big deal."
2,Auto switching does not work,"Have a Comcast HD DVR box and an Oppo DVD player connected. Was really looking forward to smart switching, but the Auto-Switching does not work, always stays on input 1 even if I start with both devices turned off and then turn source #2 on. Does not matter which device is on #1 and #2. Manual switching works fine, but I only bought this for the auto-switching. It will only auto-switch to #2 if I actually pull the power cord or the HDMI cable from the device on #1."
3,Doesn't AutoSwitch For Me,"The auto switch feature doesn't work. Manual functions just fine. It might not be terks fault. I have it hooked up to my sony sony dvd player and my dish network hd reciever. The dish network reciever never really powers off even though it might seem like it. so I think that might be the problem. The price was great. I had actullay paid $100 for it at the store but then I seen it on here for half the price. I also think it makes my picture look alot worse. I see alot of pixelation now, that i didn't see before. Well, for the price, it serves it purpose. But I'll think I'll be upgrading my tv next year to one that has more than one hdmi input."
1,Buyer beware!,"I purchased this item because of the price and other people reviews I was so wrong, item work for two days before it crash on me. Only one of the HDMI ports was working I couldn't access my DVD player nor my xbox 360. I returned the item the next day to amazon. I guess you get what you paid for."
2,"Auto switching does not work well, no remote control","The switch basically works, but the auto switching function does not always work. The Comcast cable box seems to always occupy the control even when it is turned off, and this screws up the whole system. The auto switch function does not work with Comcast cable box. No big deal, I say, just use the manual switch. However there is no remote control so I have to walk up to the switch to press the button."
2,Does not work as advertised,"This product's performance is spotty and inconsistent at best. I can't get my XBOX 360, and my DirecTV HD receiver to work consistently through this device even when using the manual button. The three HDMI cables perform perfectly when connected with either device to my Sony HD TV."
3,"Works with PS3, but....",1. Works flawlessly with the Sony Playstation 32. HDMI Error With RCA HDV-5000 flashed to HD-A1 ver 2.3
5,Has the best sound quality of any live Iggy I've heard.,"Don't buy this because Bowie plays on the album, buy it because it is classic Iggy, and unlike most of his other live recordings, the sound quality is great! The band was tight and Iggy was on his game for sure that night. Of all the Iggy's I have, this is definately the best live recorded album, yes, even better than Metallic K.O.! Best song--I NEED SOMEBODY(in my opinion)"
4,Iggy Pop - 'Sister Midnight' (Cleopatra),"Another decent archive performance from the Igster.'Sister Midnight' was recorded live at the Agora Ballroom in Cleveland,Ohio.THIS was the tour in which David Bowie played piano and supplied some of the back-up vocals.I remember reading an article about this in the old Rock Scene 'zine.Notice that most of the twelve songs here do appear to have a bit of a different arrangement than previously released versions.Most of the standouts are in fact Stooge numbers like ""Raw Power"",""Search 'N Destroy"",""TV Eye"",""Gimme Danger"" and ""No Fun"".This is in FACT a soundboard recording.Very nice."
5,Iggy In Cleveland 77,I am a huge collector of iggy's music having this under a different title I took my chances and bought it again and was amazed at the sound quality. As far as live I would recommend this along with Hippodrome (Paris 77).
2,Live Iggy Is Always Great....But....,"This release is for diehard fans only. Please trust me, or just play the sound samples and hear for yourself. This is bootleg quality. Hot Wacks would rate this good to very good soundboard at best. A great tracklist & decent performance from Iggy are not enough to recommend this. New Iggy fans would be best served by purchasing the ""Live At The Avenue B"" dvd for arguably one of the best live Iggy documents available. Long time fans may want this to complete their collection; even though you might only play it once or twice."
2,I DARE YOU TO STAY AWAKE THROUGH THIS ALBUM.,"YOU'VE ALREADY GOT THE 'STOOGES', 'FUNHOUSE', 'RAW POWER', AND 'METALLIC K.O.'. YOU'VE SIFTED THROUGH HOURS OF POORLY RECORDED (YET GLORIOUS) DEMOS, OUTTAKES, AND LIVE SHOWS. YOU CRAVE MORE. ALTHOUGH YOU WERE DISAPPOINTED WITH IGGY'S BOWIE PRODUCED (FIRST TWO, NOT COUNTING THE SUPERIOR 'KILL CITY')SOLO ALBUMS, YOU THOUGHT PERHAPS LIVE VERSIONS OF THOSE SONGS WOULD BE A LITTLE MORE RAW, A LITTLE MORE IGGY. THROW IN LIVE STOOGES CLASSICS WITH BETTER FIDELITY AND YOU CAN'T LOSE, RIGHT? WRONG. TURN BACK NOW. LIKE LOU REED'S 'ROCK N ROLL ANIMAL', THIS ALBUM CONTAINS ..., DILUTED VERSIONS OF RIGHTEOUS CLASSICS WITH WEAK NEW MATERIAL STREWN THROUGHOUT. COP YOUR FIX ELSEWHERE."
3,Bittersweet is missing something,"This is decent popular social history. However, I find it amazing that Macinnis has failed to acknowledge or reference the brilliant 1985 work on this same subject by anthropologist Sidney Mintz: Sweetness and Power: The Place of Sugar in Modern History. How could he have missed this book in doing his research?"
3,Well researched,"This book is well researched and takes a careful look at the history of sugar throughout the ages. Unfortunately the writer gets sidetracked into detailing the history of slavery as well and, while admitting that the development and success of sugar plantations in the West Indies is inextricably linked with slavery, the book would have been better if it had been more tightly focussed on the primary topic.The most interesting aspect of the book to me was that it was Australia-centric, rather than having a mind-set based on either American or English history. It's good to be reminded once in a while that there are other countries publishing books."
5,questions,"the only question I have is on playing the 5th string. B cord and C should be one fret apart,but you move two frets. Did I miss something? great tape though I haev learned more in three days than in ten years. thanks Grady"
5,a review by a shoe lover,"this is the most adorable book i possess. a friend gave it to me as a present while i was undergoing chemotherapy. she knows my love for them. any type or kind of shoe. it could be a six inch stilleto, loafers, ballerinas, clogs. you name it, i love it. the book contains many small comentaries about famous people and their shoes. this is a gift for all seasons."
3,"good song, not-so-good singer","""When My Dreams Come True"" is a great song. It has a catchy tune and fun lyrics. However, when sang by the mediocre (to say the least) Rebecca Lynn Howard, the song loses most of its chart potential. Miss Howard's voice, especially when attempting background vocals, falls achingly flat, which proves just how unremarkable her talent (or lack of it) really is. Perhaps she would benefit from some intense singing lessons, or better yet, an unconnected microphone."
5,#1 on the Way,What a great song! Strong vocals and great personality. I am seeing great things for Rebecca Lynn. I cannot wait for the entire CD.
5,What a voice!,"I really enjoyed this song,she has a great singing voice.I know she will do good in the country music world,I played with her in a concert in her home town,she is so nice,she will do good,buy this C.D. and you'll see. Catfish"
2,Misleading title,"If you expect this book to tell you in a casual and anecdotal way about the people involved in collecting enemy aircraft in Europe after World War Two; you have come to the right place.If you expect this book to tell you about the aircraft, you have not come to the right place."
2,"Dissappointing, a waste of money","I expected this to be a very good book, but it was not. The subject is certainly interesting, and this book tells a story but not in a very entertaining way. I found myself skimming sections thinking, ""Same stuff as the last chapter"". The book tells the story of a couple of Americans on a scavenger hunt for German technology at the end of WWII, but there is precious little else. If you want to know about the amazing German technological developments, or about the German scientists, pilots, and engineers, then you won't find it in this book."
3,"2.5 stars - an update of a classic, but buyer beware","This is a wonderful reference. But when I got hold of this latest edition of the Rat Nervous System, I was surprised and very disappointed to find that the chapter on the amygdala was referencing figures in the 2nd edition, rather than reprinting them here. For me, it meant the trouble of getting both editions through interlibrary loan. But if I had bought this latest edition, for this price, I would have been very upset to find essential figures missing.It depends on your needs. I'm learning to parcellate the amygdala and need access to good figures to do so. I'm sure the editors had to make difficult decisions, given the weight and humongousness of this book, but if you're thinking of getting it as a practical reference tool, preview it in a library first to make sure it hasn't cut out anything you need from earlier editions. Otherwise, what a rip off."
4,"USMC Band: Lord of the Rings, Firebird Suite","An outstanding performance ---but, the recording is at a live performance, and too many folks in the audience had serious coughs that day!! Too bad-- the LORD of the RINGS is exciting, and played by the best wind band there is."
4,Some white noise,"At first, we were going to return this for another one. After a little time, we finally realized that although we wanted to hear every breath, we didn't need to turn it up to hear so much. The trick then...keep it turned down. When you do turn it up, expect background noise. Other than this, I like the design and shape, the light indicator AND, when it's on the charger, it keeps the batteries charged! Our other one doesn't do that! If it weren't for the extra noise in the background on higher volumes, this would be a 5."
3,Review of Evenflo Whisper Connect Dual Nursery Monitor,"I found this product to be acceptable. For the low price, it delivers what I would expect. The only thing I do not like is that the monitors often pick up interference no matter where we set the receiving units. We often hearing a humming or buzzing noise coming through which causes 1 or 2 of the scrolling lights to stay on. The noise is a little annoying but you can turn the volume down. But this could be attributed to the layout of our home. Overall, they were relatively inexpensive so I am satisfied with them."
2,Didn't last long,"When we first bought this monitor, it worked great. 8 months later all we get is clicking. One of the receivers volume adjusters quit working. Call the 800 number and they recommend replacing the batteries. Did that for over $20 and still has same problems. Should've just bought a new one. Live and learn :)"
3,Nice to Have,"""Cybercitizen"" provides a crashcourse in the ways that you can use your computer to make a difference, especially in ways that you can convey your concerns to government officials. I think a good word to describe this book is ""index"", for it provides an index of nice sites that you can check out. I'm kind of worried however, that given that internet information (from website to email addresses) changes all the time, the book may become quickly out of date. I was expecting the author to not only give examples of websites but also to write about ways that you can organize on the internet (like how to use email lists, websites, internet outreach, etc.), but it doesn't have anything like that. I think this is one of the first ""how-to"" book focusing on cybera-advocacy. It is a good attempt, but it leaves a lot of room for another book."
3,Love Pink!,I love Pink but have not been able to listen t this d all the way through. It is narrated by a women with an extremely annoying voice and is basically boring. Maybe something you could listen t in the car.
4,A Loving Arrangement,"The back cover reads:""There was no use pretending. His eagle eye had penetrated her disguise. Abby pulled the pins. Her platinum hair cascaded down her shoulders. She no longer blended with the woodwork--the perfect executive secretary to the irascible trial lawyer Greyson McCullum. But she was still a fugitive from the man who had betrayed her...the man who would arrive in Atlanta within hours. Her only alternative was to flee again or accept McCullum's outrageous offer. She would pose as his live-in lover! He had offered his protection...and forced her to see him in a dangerous new light. Was she merely exchanging one risky masquerade for another?"""
5,Tired of Airtex,"So far so good. Replaced an Airtex that lasted all of about 6 months before developing problems. Car would misifire on warm days, was hard to start when the engine was warm, and pump would periodically make a loud buzzing noise. New pump in and now easy starts regardless of temp, no misfire, and no issues. 5.7 GM F.I. engine."
5,Reduce Setup time = Shingo's book,Nice book of Shingo. Easy to read with all advice that he could give you to reduce setup time.
4,Is slim a little less efficient?,I really love this vacuum. Its a joy to vacuum with Dyson. Though I feel the slim model is a little less efficient? But its good enough for my apartment. One thing I hate though is that all the accessories cost so much! I need one or two and am put off by the bad reviews and price.
5,Delivery Delivery!,"Very easy ordering.Quickest delivery at Christmas time.Light weight machine, occomplishes all the great promises.Especially happy with cat hair removal.Dustless vacuuming. How wonderful is that?Thank you Amazon.com and Dyson."
5,Amazing!,I love this machine. It is worth every penny. It is so easy to use and works so well. I look forward to vacuumming and sometimes I'll do it twice a week because it's fun to use and I am eager to see what it picks up. I have long hair and this is the only vacuum that easily picks it up without it getting tangled and clogging things. My little apartment is so much cleaner now!
4,dyson dc-18 slim - good as expected,"After reading several reviews (all good) I bit the bullet and spent the $ for the Dyson slim. I am very happy with the product and disagree with most of the comments written negatively about the vacuum. It is easy to use and powerful. If I had any negative feedback, it would be that there is not an auto retraction device on the cord and that you have to toggle the brushes between carpet and hard wood - it is not automatic. I am impressed by the pickup on this dyson and use it daily (I have a bird who litters her feathers and seed). I would definitely recommend this product."
5,Best Vacuum Ever,"This vacuum is the best - it picks up everything!! The design makes it easy to maneuver and clean. I had an issue where it stopped sucking and realized the filter was clogged. As soon as I removed the stuff that accumulated, it was sucking once again.I wondered if the vacuum would be worth the money and it is."
4,Awesome,"I had heard about the Dyson vacuums and their great reputation. I was truly excited to finally get one. The DC18 is slim and maneuvers in circles and spirals, awesome. I am still not comfortable with how it switches to ""stick-mode"" automatically because it sometimes does that when I don't mean for it to. Maybe I'll get used to that..."
3,Over-rated plastic machine,"For all the hype this machine receives, YES, it is tremendously better than the average Hoover and such............BUT the average Hoover doesn't cost 400 plus or minus.The product has a over-all plastic appeal and I'm very down on the manual cord-winding due to the fact you have to unwind the entire line if you want to use the wand feature.It's plus is definitely the suction and ease at which it is to take apart the front floor piece.I would've felt much better at a price of 175-250 tops."
3,Design Flaw,"This vacuum was really expensive, and I am still debating whether it was worth the cost. The main gripe is the design of the machine itself. It tips over easily and will not stand up straight in the closet. Yesterday, I heard a loud bang coming from the hall closet and thought that the cats had gotten into something. No, it was just the vac falling over in the closet, pushing the door open and falling onto the floor! The hose is short and awkward to use, and the two on board tools are really cheap. On the plus side, the suction is acceptable and the ease of cleaning and bag-less feature are great. I just think that I could probably have purchased a comparable cleaner for less than half the cost. The engineers really need to address the tipping over problem as this is the most annoying."
4,Best Vacuum I have ever had,"I had been looking for a Dyson for a while and when the slim became available in Canada, I picked one up. I was amazed at how it went under all of the furniture as it is so nimble. I have a one bedroom apartment, two cats and previously had a Panasonic upright. I had to empty the canister 3 times the first time I vacuumed. After that I only have to empty it once when I am done. I vacuum every two to 3 weeks. The only issue is that it seems to have a slight high pitched whine. I am contacting Dyson to see if this is normal."
2,"I wanted to like it, but......","I've heard great things about Dyson - my mom has 5 cats, and 2 dogs and she SWEARS by her Dyson ""Animal"". I got the 'Slim' - trying to save a bit of $$ over the 'animal'. At first it worked pretty good - I really thought it would have more suction power than it did, but it worked. After 2 weeks of use, it started to get clogged every single time I use it. In all fairness, we do have a dog and 6 long haired cats, but still.... Now it barely sucks at all (no clogs that I can find), and the base of the unit gets super hot after just a minute or so of use. The stand doesn't always kick down when it's pushed upright, and it just falls over - very annoying.Maybe I just got a defective one. I called Dyson's helpline, which was no help at all. After reading all the stories of being charged for replacements and services (even tho it's under warranty), I've yet to take it into a repair shop. Maybe some day.....In short, I wanted to love this vacuum, but it just isn't happening."
2,Power button broke already,"I bought the Dyson DC18 in April, 2007. I only used it maybe half a dozen times. Last Sunday, the power button broke. When I press down on it, the power comes on. When I remove my finger, the power goes off. I had to sent it off for repair. This is disappointing for a vacuum cleaner that cost $469.99. I had an inexpensive Kenmore that lasted over ten years without servicing. And the Kenmore will probably last another ten years without servicing."
4,Pricey but worth it in the LONG run.,"When I first bought this product, I thought the price was too high. Four years later we still have ours and it is running fine. Never had a problem with it. Easy to maintain IF YOU CLEAN IT a few times a year. Don't hesitate to buy the Slim. IT'S WORTH IT!"
2,Not worth the price,"It seems that Dyson has discontinued this model, and that's a very good thing. On day one I could tell it had less power than the cheap, 6 year old Dirt Devil that it was replacing, and it only got worse as the unit aged. At two years old it couldn't pick up dry cat litter off a tile floor. I've very happily replaced it with Hoover that cost less than half of what the Dyson Slim did. The Hoover isn't much to look at, but the construction quality is the same as the Dyson and it cleans 3 times better than the Dyson did when I first got it."
3,Works well when it's not broken!,"I'll admit we are hard on vacuums with two cats and two kids, but after paying all that money for a vacuum, I expected better quality. When it works, it works. But it breaks often -- either the hose is clogged or the pedal doesn't work when you want to use the floor mechanism, or a switch goes out and you have to hold down the button to keep it on. It's always something with this vacuum. I'm very disappointed in this after hearing all the hype about Dysons. It's also very heavy and I can't imagine anyone but those in decent shape using this. It would not be appropriate for elderly or disabled."
3,ball is by nature unstable,"I love Dyson, but I like my DC14 much better. I think it has better suction and better attachment. I think this Dyson is prettier, but I still can't get used to the ball. I hate that the whole thing falls in any direction if I let go of the handle. I feel that it's putting much more stress in my wrist. Anyway for a small studio this works just fine, but for a bigger place i think u better get the DC 14. you can get a refurb one for like $350 online."
1,Overpriced piece of plastic garbage,"I have had NOTHING but trouble out of this piece of garbage. I have had it in the shop more than out, be forewarned the ""warranty"" doesn't cover much because when you take it to the shop you will get a bill for items that aren't covered usually about $90+ worth. I don't abuse this vacuum, and had my old Hoover for 10 years before replacing it, so I know it isn't me. I don't try to suck up anything large or bulky just normal floor dirt and yet it constantly loses suction and doesn't work! I had this thing in the shop within a month of purchasing it! The man at the vacuum cleaner repair shop also agreed that they were overpriced and worthless. Save your money and buy something else!"
1,Look at other sellers,"Before I purchased this vacuum I would or should have looked arround. I notified Amazon that the company was selling factory direct almost $100. less. Amazon dismissed the overpricing by saying they didn't have time to check every item. They do not have a price matching policy. Be careful this is a great vacuum; however, be more through in checking prices. I could have returned it w/o opening and purchased from another dealer. I suppose Amazon would rather go through this process. I used to brag Amazon, now I will not blindly trust them to be the least expensive."
5,Love the Dyson,"Never thought I'd enjoy vacuuming so much. This is the best vacuum I have ever used. It is nimble, light, and powerful. Truly amazing. The cord is a little short, so I can't vacuum multiple rooms without replugging it in. That is a minor complaint. I'd recommend this item to anyone!"
5,DC 18 is awesome.,"My wife and I bought the Dyson DC 18 from Macy's and let me tell you when I got this thing assembled I let it loose on the living room and after having our carpets cleaned the week prior it still managed to pull up tons of dust, dirt, and soap left behind by the carpet cleaner. I vacuum every other day and it amazes me with its suction. It manages to pull up everything that we tracked in the prior day and we easily dump it in the trash without messing with bags. All I can say is I was skeptical when I spent $299.00 for this vacuum cleaner but now that I have seen the light there is not a chance I would ever buy anything other than a Dyson. You will never regret your purchase."
4,Amazing Vacuum!,"I absolutely love this vacuum. It is small, lightweight, and relatively quiet (at least compared to my old vacuum). The only two complaints I have is that it is sometimes difficult to turn off (you have to hit the button in a certain way) and it can be hard to set the vacuum in ""stand up mode"" because the latch doesn't always catch. Minor inconveniences, but not enough to deter me from recommending this vacuum to everyone."
3,good text--poor editing,"Edvard Radzinsky has created a fine story, albeit not one of first-class historical content. He maintain the readers interest thoughout. However, the work suffers from poor editing. Sentence fragments are a regular occurrence. Even worse, are the obvious errors on dates. His newspaper style of writing also detracts from confidence in the work's historical basis."
2,Translation & Editing Makes Book Unintelligible,"What a disappointment!!!!! I was so excited to find this book and eager to see what would be uncovered in the Soviet's files. But it really appears as if a computer did the translation. You can even see the direct translation, word by word, directly from Russian. Unfortunately, this doesn't work. Sentences have no verbs. Grammatical mistakes abound, e.g., a animal. I have studied Russian history for 25 years and I'll plod through this book (think Zhivago crossing the tundra) -- but the sentence construction may make it so that it takes equally long to finish this book."
3,"Very detailed, could have been shortened","Radzinsky wrote a very detailed study about Rasputin. Based on previously unkown documentary materials and drawing on a wide range of archives he presents a thorough picture of the whereabouts of the notorious priest in Moscow and Russia. Unfortunately the author sometimes gets lost in details. Maybe it would have been better to present his material in a shortened from, leaving some details aside; or to ad an index to his book and an appendix which would have contained short biographies of the central figures in his study. Anyway this is a very important study which contributes a lot to a better understanding of this very important period in world history. This understanding could be pushed further by other studies about enigmatic figures in the political centres of major powers comparable to Rasputin..."
2,An opportunity lost,Radzinsky has uncovered some fascinating and invaluable information. Unfortunately he presents it in an irritating format that is practically unreadable. It would have been better had he just published a translation of the files that he found.
4,OK,It's an OK book. Easier to read than the others that he has written and good info. But still didn't really grab my attention.
4,The scoop on Rasputin,"Edvard Radzinsky's book in indispensable for understanding the Rasputin mystery. Rasputin has been blown into an occult force by some historians but this book shows the devious, lustful, charming Siberian peasant behind the legend, who convinced the Tsarina of his sanctity. One also sees what happened from the point of view of police reports and the elegant, sordid demi-monde habituated by Felix Youssopov and Grand Duke Dmitri. It finally becomes clear who the real murderer was. Reads like a detective novel - by a great historian and writer!!"
5,Excellent,"I strongly recommend it. After reading Edvard Radzinskii's ""The Last Tzar"", I bought this book. Glad I did so. Fascinating description of the environment backed with authentic documents."
1,A waste of money,"This book hardly deserves even one star. It is a typical example of a great man's biography written by a dime novel scribbler. It presents poorly organized Radzinsky's hectic emotions based mostly on newspaper gossip and well known memoirs of prince Felix Yusupov etc.For instance: the circumstances of Rasputin's murder as depicted in this book have nothing in common with the real events which have been reconstructed quite recently by Andrew Cook in his well researched ""To Kill Rasputin: The Life and Death of Gregori Rasputin"". For a complete and more accurate biography of Rasputin you should find the book by Russian historian Oleg Platonov, though I am not sure his works have been translated in English.Of course you may come across even worse books about Rasputin, but it is hardly an excuse for these 500 pages of hackneyed rubbish."
4,The Rasputin File by Edvard Radzinsky,"This product's existence came to my attention while I was watching a documentary on Rasputin's life on YouTube. There were many complaints about its lack of detail and complaints about most of the documentary's information being just propaganda and lies. Then, I read one comment that said that a book called The Rasputin File was much more detailed and much more truthful than the documentary. I looked it up and Amazon and bought a copy. I have not gotten very far into it yet but I would like to say that every time I pick it up and read it, I am always enticed to know a little more about this mysterious man whose life and death are both equally strange. I recommend this for all who are interested in learning a little Russian history or would like to expand their knowledge on it."
2,Arrrruuggghhhh!,"I'm sorry, but I must agree with those reviewers who have taken Rudzinsky and his translator to task for the writing in this book. Yeah, maybe it's a critique of form over substance, but the way this tome is written/translated is maddening. Oh, Edvard, there's this thing in the English language called a VERB - you may want to check that out sometime. We also have a quaint habit of enjoying a story in sequence - not a jumbled mess with little timeline. How many ""In the meantimes"" can a reader take? In the same vein ... next time around, how about cutting back on the expression ""But in the File it said"" from 350 or so to a few dozen?For readers that what the Rasputin story without the need for a linguistic compass, I suggest ""Rasputin - The Spirit Who Sinned"" by Brian Moynahan."
2,Lacking,"I was expecting an exciting book, something riveting and well thought out. Rasputin was by all accounts an exciting character, shady, mystical, sexual, aggressively climbing the social ladder. Why then was this book such a disappointment? The time line was hard to follow, the character development was lacking and the sentences poorly structured -- was it botched in translation into English? At any rate, it's going to a garage sale, I can't finish it and I'm not interested to force myself to continue reading."
4,"Interesting, but could use a better editor","Radzinksky certainly had access to some new material which has not been explored, and because of that this book is important. But as some of the previous reviewers have noted, the reader has to wade through the repetetive nature of Radzinsky's story, coupled with some possible translation problems, it does not make for a casual read.However, if you can overcome these minor nuisances, the book tells an incredible story. If you do not know much about Rasputin's influence on the Romanov court, this will be an eye-opener. I was floored by the the level of influence Rasputine had over the Tsarina and in turn the Tsar.His death reminds one of a Greek tragedy, but I will let you make the link yourself. Overall a good story, but poorly edited."
2,The Rasputin File falls Short,"As a person who enjoys Russian History and has read The Last Tsar by Radzinsky I was throughly disappointed. I loved the Last Tsar, but for some reason this book just did not do it for me. Rasputin is an enigmatic figure who should come alive through this book, but the book is boring. It is not well written or well translated. It's confusing. The information about Rasputin is very interesting but I could not get through this book. If you want a good book on Russian History, go with The Last Tsar."
4,the diabolical monk,"No one will ever understand how Rasputin was able to get close to the Russian imperial family, being a simple monk. Was it pure luck that he was brought to the Romanovs when their son was sick or was it a miracle? Point is that this man destroyed this family with his lies.Radzinsky's book offers insights into Rasputin that no one else has written before. The information on his childhood is very interesting for instance. It is a well known fact that Rasputin had incredible power over the imperial court, but I didn't know that he was the one who brought down the Russian government.The death of Rasputin has always been surrounded by myths. Thanks to this book, everyone can read what really happened. Anyone who is interested in Russian history and its religions shoud read this."
3,Pottery and porcelain repair information thin,"I do appreciate the nice photography in this handsome book, but was disapointed with the content. Materials and techniques are not well described."
4,Crystal Lake Woodstock IL pocket map,This is a nice compact street map that can be kept in the car for reference purposes.
5,"Love it, works great","Love it, works great... Why do we have to submit so many words? It keeps you from getting reviews...please don't make us write so many words."
2,Just not what I expected,"For some reason, I just assumed this book would be much bigger - both in physical size and content - than it is. There was really nothing in this book I hadn't read before. It's great if you're a beginner to either Feng Shui or Decluttering; however, if you're looking for some ""off the beaten path"" ideas, this isn't the book."
5,OLD BOOK LIKE NEW!,Great service and packaging. The book I received was in better condition than I had anticipated. Many Thanks!!
4,not bad not bad,"Well it's totally game for the Hunter to Nakai. And they played it well. Very entertaining, thrilling and actions."
3,The third Predator novel based on a comic...,"and it seems to be the weakest. Not only does the Predator seem to kill at random, sometimes leaving heads BEHIND, heads he went out of his way to collect. But also he blows up an army base, kills a pig, some sheep, gets ambushed by a puma, besides killing lots of soldiers.Why bother to go about CLOAKED if you're going to bring the whole MILITARY down on your head? Where's the sport in it? And why give up his ship to the army? Did it crash or did he fail to properly hide it?Too many plot holes and they tried to make the Predator an 'Evil' monster instead of just a alien hunter. I'm not saying he isn't doing evil things, but he isn't a 'MONSTER' either."
2,It was to predictable.,"Sandy Schofield is an excellent writer; when I read Aliens: Rogue, I was breathless throughout the whole story. However, Predator: Big Game was too short, and you never really got to know the characters except for Enoch Nakai. It was never explained why the Predator blew up his own ship, and as far as ""The Hunt"" goes that the Predators always embark on when they come to Earth, there wasn't anything significant about it in Big Game. All it was was ""Bang, you're dead"" over and over and over. It got boring. I didn't even want to finish the story for fear of being completely dissatisfied. All in all, I hope your next book can be as good as Aliens: Rogue, Sandy."
3,Not the best Predator novel.,"I am a fan of the Predator movies and books. I read Concrete Jungle,Cold War and this mess called Big Game. Some things i like about it include the Predator scenes and the action. What I didn't like about it were: No Predator POV, and the Predator only used it's shoulder cannon. No disk...no spear...no wrist blades. I also didn't like the end. In the Predator novels and movies the Predators always cover their tracks in the end. And the goal I think is that Earth doesn't get it's hands on the technology. The ending makes it so it could be taken. That sort of ruins it. If you are looking for great Predator stories check out Concrete Jungle and Cold War."
3,Its ok.,I really liked the other Predator and AVP books but this one let me down. The detail and the writing was fine but I found the story lacking. It was so far removed from the other books and characters that it felt completely different and just not right.
4,Undergrad Numerical Method Textbook,"The content is typical of an undergraduate course in numerical methods. The author employs Python for that. It doesn't tell you how to use various modules available on the net. Instead, the author sticks to the standard few and explains numerical methods from the very basics. The book is very good for an introduction coursework. However, if you are a researcher looking for tools for serious numerical computation and thinking of using Python as an efficient and convenient organizer(or ""glue"") rather than a number cruncher, you might as well consult the book by H.P. Langtangen.This book is also useful if you want to get a hang on how a textbook numerical method would work on Python. You can then use the language for a quick algorithm prototyping in your own work."
1,Razr Battery,This item was stated as new .I should have been Leery at the cheap price but I have never recieved used junk from any of the vendors that I have dealt with at Amazon before This battery was in a sealed plastic bag that the vendor obviously heat shrunk This battery had less life in it than the one I was replacing I followed the charging instructions to a Tee and yet the battery gets continually weaker. It only holds a charge for one day now.
3,Motorola Razr battery okay - service great,"Quick service on delivery. Priced way below retail. Doesn't hold a charge nearly as long as the original when new but much, much better than the original on replacement."
2,Not Very Happy - New Black Battery for Razor Cell Phone,"We ordered four of the batteries to have a couple of backups. As it turns out, we needed one of those backups immediately. The first battery we inserted in my Razor cell phone would not hold a charge for 1/2 day or less if used. They were supposed to be the new ""Black"" BR50 battery.If you have anything to do with product quality, then these batteries should be replaced. We purchased 4 of them. I wish that I could have reported a better review - but you asked and now you know.Lynn OsthusGordon Osthus"
1,Still Waiting.,"I placed the original order in late October. As of November 25th, I am still awaiting the arrival of my order. I have made contact with the company; they resent the order 2 weeks ago. I still do not have my product."
5,Fine replacement,"This battery is a fine replacement for the original. Our Razr was going just a few hours between charges, so we were happy to find such a low price on a replacement battery. It works just fine."
5,Razr battery,"Received this item in a timely fashion. It works great, too bad the phone is having issues. Great service."
5,great priced alternative,even if this thing only lasts for a month (it looks like it will definitly last that long) it was so cheap you could afford to buy several.
4,BR50 Motorola Razr Li-ion Battery,Great price for this replacement battery. After reading other reviews I selected the vendor for this replacement battery because all of these battery are not equal. They may look the same but they are not equal in performance. However the price of these batteries allows you to buy several at a time. I am getting approximately 2 1/2 days of charge out the ones I purchased. I can't say for sure but I bet these are knock offs. Bottom line it's a better deal than paying over $40.00 for a BR50 at the dealers and not knowing whether it's going to do any better. The Razr is not a very good long term performance phone and these inexpensive batteries will do just fine for your needs.
3,BR50 Battery,I am not satisfied with the product. With mobile in standalone mode gets discharged in around 20 hrs and after a talk-time of an hour we need to charge again.
4,BR50,"I purchased 2 BR50 batteries for my wife and myself to replace the existing batteries in our Razr V3c phones from motorola. The batteries arrived with enough charge in them to operate but needed to be charged for normal use.We have been using these batteries now for a few weeks and have had no problem with them at all. They are a little stronger than the original batteries so we are pleased with the extra time. neither my wife or myself use the phone a great deal so it is usually in standby, but the charge will last several days for us. Delivery was very quick, like only a couple of days after the order.All in all we are very pleased with this item."
1,Poor product that does not last!,"The battery that was sent to me does not last at all. In fact, it barely lasts 2 hours after charging it for 2 days straight. This is a very poor product and I am skeptical that this company is even selling new batteries. I wonder if I got someone's trashed battery sent to me disguised as a new product. Do not buy this battery, consider yourself warned!"
2,"No, depth of charge.","I recieved these batteries in short order, USPS at $20. I ordered 4 batteries. We have two phones that use them. Charged them up when I recieved them and when placed in the phone, they work great for the first two bars, but when there are two bars showing on the battery life, the phone is eminently close to going dead. We have lost a few phone calls because after the warning it turns off quickly. They do not seem to be acting like new batteries. Don't know what else to say."
2,Short- Charged,Does not hold a charge more than two days on standby. It does not work aswell as the original battery. But the price was right.
1,Horrible,This battery holds a charge for less time than my failing old battery does. Don't waste your money.
2,Razr V3 battery,Lasts a little longer than the one it replaced. Definitely does not last as long as a brand new one.
1,Short circuited,Don't waste your money. I bought three of these duds and had to charge my phone daily. I used two in two manths and threw the third away. My advise to anyone who will listen is to buy an original Motorola battery.
1,It must have been used,"I bought this to replace my old V3 RAZR battery which wasn't holding much of a charge anymore. It was only slightly better, but nothing like my original battery when it was new. Don't waste your money.. it might be more expensive, but buy something that's actually new!"
1,Battery lasts for about a day,"This battery is even worse than the OEM battery that came with my RAZR that I've used for two years. My old battery use to be able to hold a charge for 5-6 days but after 2 years, I had to charge it every other day. So I decided to give these a try. Turns out these are probably used ones that have been recharged and can only hold charge for 1 day. These cheap batteries are always a hit or a miss. I'm still looking for a place to actually get NEW RAZR batteries."
2,a new battery worse than my orignal battery to be replaced,"i purchased a battery to replace the original one for my Motorola Razr v3.This item came with a relatively low price. However, it is much lighter than my original battery and the white plastic cover of the battery is partialy detached from the body.The original battery, when it is new, can last for about 1 and half day, and it currently lasts for less than one day. However this one i just purchased only lasts for half a day!!!!i will not buy any battery from the seller."
2,New Motorola BR50 battery black,"The battery only lasts for 2 days. Not sure if it is a new battery. Then again, I did only pay a few bucks for it."
5,Very Satisfied,"I was excited about the price of the Motorola V3 battery but I was somewhat skeptical because it was so inexpensive. I received the product, charged it,and am completely satisfied with my purchase. It was definetly worth it."
1,Received wrong size battery,"I ordered a Motorola battery for my razor V3 according to the specs and model on the website and a couple of weeks ago, complained via e-mail to the seller that I had received a bigger battery that does not fit into my phone. They said they would send the correct one and it has been a couple of weeks and I have not received anything. Very dissapointed with this purchase. Advise: Don't fall into buying very cheap products that you think you are getting a great deal out of it...can be tricky."
5,OEM Battery at a GREAT price,"My cell phone company wanted $60.00 for this battery and did not have it in stock. By purchasing it through Amazon, I saved over $50.00 and had it sooner than otherwise possible."
2,Don't perform like they're new,"Purchased four ""new"" OEM batteries for my RAZR. RAZR Battery life was never a strong point, but none of these batteries seem to hold a charge for longer than 1 - 1 1/2 days even in standby. They look brand new, but at this price and performance I wonder if they're production line rejects."
1,Poor Battery Life,I ordered these batteries and they were no better than the old ones. I requested a replacement however non was sent. Dont waste your money on these.
2,Too good to be true,"After getting this battery, and installing it into my Razr, it isn't the same battery as the original. It causes the phone to display a ""error"" message stating: INVALID BATTERY""."
2,It's used.,Length:: 2:32 MinsThis review should give you a pretty good idea of whether you want to buy this battery.
3,Not as good as new but works,"These batteries can't be new. I purchased one and it didn't hold a charge for more than 4 hours. I e-mailed the company and they sent me another battery right away (awesome customer service!) The new battery has to be charged every night, but it's much better than the one I had. I would buy this item again, because I saved about 40 dollars and know that if the battery doesn't work I can get another one with no problem."
4,Good Enough,I got the battery in the mail. Charged it overnight. It burned out after 20 minutes of talking. Talked to the seller. Got a new one in the mail in a few days. Much better. Totally worth the two dollars.
2,Doesn't hold charge,"I bought two batteries for both mine and my husband's phones. Although supposed to be new batteries, I question that. They never keep their charge for more than a day. My original battery would stay charged for three or more days! I think these batteries are sitting on a shelf way too long before being shipped out. These are not new batteries, in my opinion."
2,Short Battery Life,This battery is worse than the one it replaced. I went back to using the original battery that came with the phone because the charge lasts 3 times longer.
3,okay battery for its price.,"I bought this battery to replace my 1.75 years old original battery that died down within half a day of moderate usage. The new battery arrived promptly from the seller. However it was only a little better and it would last for a day at most. The seller was kind enuf to send me a replacement battery, but it behaved the same way. I believe it may be related to the Razr phone (which I doubt). I do not have experience with any other batteries to compare this battery with.I am not complaining much since the price is low."
1,You only get what you pay for,"I thought this battery might last longer than a day but I was wrong. I only payed $3.00 dollors for it and that's exactly what I got. The shipping cost me more than the actually battery. Do not buy anything like this on Amazon, aparently they sell defective merchandise. Go to a quality local store for quality items. Don't get burned like I did."
3,excellent battery replacement.... nice price,"excellent price,,, you save quite a few bucks buying it online than if purchased at the cell phone store"
4,Happy with my shopping experiance,I bought this product for a very cheap price and was very happy that i recived this product in a very short time. But unfortuantely this product stopped working after a couple of weeks and i immediately contacted the vendor who sold me this product(accessoryone) and was very pleased with their immediate response and the effort on their part to ship me another one.i recieved the replacement part yesterday and i found it to be in good working condition. i will however have to wait for a few weeks to actually see that i do not get a repeat performance from the the battery.But i am really happy from the overall shoping experiance for this product
5,Big D,I received the battery in good condition and promptly. The battery has functioned like it should and I would order another from this supplier in the future.
3,"Good product, deceptive pricing","So far, it works. I am still waiting to see how long a life it has. The vendor though could be a little more transparent. I smelled fish when I saw the ridiculously low pricing. Then I realized at check out that they were going to take it through the backdoor with equally ridiculously high shipping and handling fees. I ended up buying one quarter the quantity I wanted...........Well, it still came out cheaper than other places."
2,Disappointing,"I suppose the price should have been my warning but I ignored it!I bought this battery to replace the dying original.I find that it does not give anyway near the expected hours and just a few minutes ago when I started to recharge, the phone started acting up.I had to remove and reinsert to clear the problem.If it weren't so cheap I would have been crying about being ripped off.Anyway, chalk that up to experience."
4,Great deal!,"This battery cost so much less than if you were to buy it in a store, yet it's the same battery. It is expensive to ship it, but still costs significantly less than elsewhere."
5,Great Value,"I needed 2 Razor batteries, so my options were to buy here for less than $3 each or go to Verizon and spend $30-40 each? Tough call, these batteries work great, no issues, I bought a third battery, just in case, but it is just sitting. Don't be fooled by the low price, these are just as good as the ones they sell for 10X the amount in the mall."
4,alright,"I ordered a new battery for my phone because my battery life was only about 2 days long, which seemed pretty short. The new battery didn't improve things. No fault of the seller, might be a Motorola thing."
1,Really bad battery,This battery lasts less than a day with no calls. This is much worse than the old year old battery that I was trying to replace.
5,Excellent battery,"This is an excellent battery, good quality and high capacity. I would buy another one."
1,2-1/2 Year Old Battery from DBRoth,"Received BR50 battery with date code of 20061028 in May 2009 (2 and a half years old). LITHIUM ION BATTERIES DEGRADE NEARLY AS FAST IN STORAGE AS IN USE. This battery will not last long (guaranteed). Best to buy locally, where you can verify the date code (on back, under bar code) before purchase. These sellers are just DUMPING OLD, WORTHLESS STOCK."
2,BR50 Battery,I bought two batteries to replace ones the came with the phones my wife and I bought over a year ago. The odd thing is these batteries did not perform any better than the old ones. This lead me to think that the batteries that I bought may have been used or not up to manufacturer standards. I continue to use the ones I bought but am not satisfied with their performance.
4,Battery arrived in a timely manner,The battery was shipped in a timely manner in great condition. Came in when I needed it -I was travelling to another state and my phone battery was not holding its charge. It was at the address I indicated and delivered promplty.
1,"Bought from Eforcity and 4 months later, it's dead",I purchased this 4 months ago and it has been sparingly used (mostly standby) and it's dead. It won't recharge and there's nothing wrong with the charger or the phone.
1,BAD BATTERY,"I got the battery home, put it in my cell phone charged it and it NEVER WORKED!!! It is a cheap piece of junk, do not be fooled by the low cost."
5,Great battery,"Replaced my old battery in the V3M (Verizon). The original battery that came with it would not hold a charge after about 6mo. The new one works excellent! It should fit all Razrs with no problems. The mistake that I think I made with the original battery is that I left it charging too long, sometimes overnight. I think it's best to stop charging as soon as it's complete. At this price you cannot beat it. The Verizon store quoted me $39."
1,no battery,"great price, it never showed up, nobody knows were it went, the burden of proof was on me."
3,Not a problem with the store - it's the item I hate,These batteries stink. This is NOT a problem with the store as the item was exactly as specified and shipping was fast. No problems there. It's just that these Motorola Razor batteries suck. Charge to full capacity and they still die in a day or two when turned OFF! Motorola really needs to get on the ball with this one. You pay a fortune for this phone and then spend another fortune on replacing sucky batteries. Not fair.
5,Excellent!,The battery works perfectly and I haven't had any problems with it. For the price it cannot be beat!
1,False Advertising,"I bought the Motorola BR50 for my Razr V3. It was sold by Eforcity and was advertised as new. But when I used it, the performance of the battery was a lot worse than the old battery that I was replacing. For starters, it came in a brown envelop and inside was the battery in a small simple plastic bag. Stand-by time of the battery was only about a day. And even at full charge, after 2 short calls the battery starts draining already. In my opinion, Eforcity sold me an old battery that is completely useless to them, and to me. I don't know if Amazon could do anything about this kind of sale, but I hope they do because it is just not right."
4,good value for money,Product arrived promptly and has been in use ever since. No problems to date. It was a good value for the money.
2,You get what you pay for (very little),Last only 6 to 8 hours. I only talk on the phone maybe ten minutes a day.So Now I have two batteries that won't hold a charge. I charge them both on my day off and switch. Thank goodness I have a charger at work and a charger in the car. I should have trusted the reviews!
1,Don't order this product,"This product was defective. I know the Razr batteries don't last very long anyway, but the battery I ordered was just as bad as the battery I had for over a year. It died in less than two days. And that's just from being on...not even from being used."
2,Motorola V3 Razr battery,"Order BR50 battery for my V3 Razr here thru Eforcity. Received it within a week. I used it for about a week or so, charging it and fully draining it each time. Battery never lastest more than 5 hours standby time. My old battery was lasting longer than that. Contacted Eforcity thru Amazon. They immediately sent me a replacement. Unfortunately, that battery lasted about the same amount of time, 4 to 5 hours. To be fair, I haven't try any other battery, so I don't know if my phone or the charger are bad. But since my original battery is lasting longer than the battery I got from here, I have to assume that the batteries they sent were bad. Their customer service was excellent and they tried to remedy the first battery problem by immediately replacing the first one. It only cost me $4.25 plus shipping. Not worth my time nor effort to return batteries for refund."
1,Bad Battery,The battery I received barely works better than my old battery. A cheap imitation at best. Oh well for 8 bucks I guess it was too good to be true.
1,no juice,The battery was no better than the old one it did not hold any power for more than 8-12 hours. :(
3,Motorla battery - BR50,"Don't know if the is a new one or a used one that the vendor sent, but this is clearly nowhere close to the original battery that came with the RAZR. Relatively speaking, it feels like the original battery when is was 6-8 months old.But I guess for $7 or so (including shipping) it's not a bad deal."
1,Did not work at all - even the second one. DO NOT BUY.,A complete wastage of money. They sent a replacement battery after the first one did not work - the second one was no different.
1,BR50 - Motorola Razr V3 / V3c / V3i OEM Li-Ion Battery - New Black - Retail Packaged,"The product that I bought does not work. I believe this product to be refurbised or a used product. I had to throw the product away. It was junk. I cannot believe I purchased this thing. I will never buy anything from this site again. It is had to phantom that this site would endorse this seller, to sell products like this. This purchase ruined my experiance. Like I said I would never buy anything from this site again.Motorola Razr V3 V3i V3c V3m Original OEM Lithium Ion Battery BR50 SNN5696B"
5,Motorola Battery for Razr,"Excellent value, new equipment and works as advertised. Slooow delivery time to east coast - - 21 days."
3,Good and Bad,"It seams like my phone has less battery life with this new battery than it did when I first bought it. I've got a V3c, maybe this battery was made for V3?Otherwise, great price, fast shipping, everything as advertised."
4,Razor Battery - 1 / 10 th Price of Retail,"My son and daughter both ordered this battery for their Razrs.And reported that it worked well for them at an unbeliveably low price.I was sceptical, but decided for $ 4.11 I could afford the risk.I it one tenth the cost of the outrageously expensive batteries fromBest Buy and Verizon Stores.Logically, the price seem reasonable since it is only the size of a couple of AA batteries.So far it Seems to work very well.Can't speak to long term longevity, but so far it holds a charge for at least as long as the OEM.$4.11 vs $ 40.00"
3,Razr Battery,Did not last long. Not sure if it was the qulity of the battery or the phone killing it.
5,"fast, reliable. no problems!!",I got my battery faster than I expected and it was exactly what I needed. The company was great.
3,BR50 - Motorola RAZR Replacement Battery review,"Like many other reviews before, this is a Lithium battery and the life span decreases as the battery ages, even if it's brand new and just sitting on the shelf.Initially the charging will stay longer but will start loosing the power quicker as the time progresses.We have been using the battery for about a month now and so far it's holding up the power. We will have to wait for couple of months to see how it will perform."
2,Cheap battery,"Girlfriend (of the time) needed a new battery for her phone, which would die after less than a day of usage. I bought her this because it was inexpensive and a NEW battery MUST last more than a day right? Wrong. The battery seems VERY cheaply made (looks like a counterfeit with fake Motorola hologram too!) and would run out of juice very quickly. I would not buy this product again, but I think I got 5 dollars worth of battery!"
4,Recycled?,"My old battery didn't hold a charge anymore, so I thought I'd take a chance with this very inexpensive battery that came branded as an original Motorola battery, but at a price almost too good to be true. It holds a charge, recharges fairly quickly, but it doesn't last as long as a brand new one... so I'm assuming that this is a used (or very old) battery. BUT, for the money, it IS worth it."
1,Defective Battery,"The battery would not hold a charge. I notified the company twice and they said they would replace the battery, but it never happened. I would not buy anything from this company in the future and I would remove them from your roster of approved sellers.I have always fely secure buying through Amazon, but this experience has made me very wary of using your service in the future. Buyer Beware!"
2,So So,"The 1st battery I was sent did not hold a charge and I could not turn the phone on. I was sent a replacement battery after sending an e-mail (couldn't speak w/ anyone in person), which took about a week+/- to receive and was not able to use my phone during this time. The price was much better ($6.00+/-) than what I was quoted by AT&?($45). The 2nd battery is holding a charge for about a week depending on usage. I would recommend based on price only, but would suggest holding onto your battery if it is somewhat functional."
1,Terrible - STAY AWAY !!!,Wrote to seller 3 times with no response. Finally item was refunded by Amazon by filing claim. Battery never worked. Warn everyone to stay away from this seller.
2,BR50-Motorola-Razr-V3Batteries,"I've bought two BR50-Motorola-Razr-V3 batteries from Amazone.com that sold by ""Ace Photo digital"" in Dec 2008. Ace said these batterie are new. I cannot read the instruction on these batteries because they made in China, with the Chinese words of instruction on them ?: One battery can stand by for 4 days and another one stand by just for 2 days. Therefore, I consider these batteries are cheap ($7.00/EA)and not good to be used in America. Ace Photo Digital has sent to me One ""OK"" (last for 4days) and One ""Bad"". I think we need more feedback for the reviews of this seller (Ace photo digital) from the other buyers. With me Ace Photo digital gets a ""two stars"" for the products it sold to me.Bill"
3,Not exactly new,"The battery was made about 2.5 years ago. From what I've read, the expected shelf life of a Li-Ion battery is only 2-3 years. I'll be surprised if it last a year. For now, it works great."
1,lousy batteries!,After only six days of use the battery died and would not take a charge. Dont buy this!!!!!!
1,Shipping - Expectations,"At the time when the order was placed it stated the items were in stock, and the shipping time frame would be 4-5 days. Now I am told it may take up too 14 business days before get the batteries. Major let down.Beware before buying"
1,Motorola Battery,These batteries are terrible. The original battery in my Razr lasted 4 times longer.
4,It Works,Works about as well as my original battery that came with the phone. A great deal for the price.
5,"Great Price, lasts a long time",The batteries came quickly. They were all OEM and work great. I bought extra ones at that price.
1,Doubt product is new OEM,The batteries I purchased do not have any longer battery life than the ones I replaced
5,Razr Battery,I recieved the product within 2 weeks and it works just fine. I wish the delivery was a bit faster but overall it was a good buy and I would buy from them again.
2,Get what you paid for,Purchased two batteries. First battery received works great. Second battery is worthless. Will contact seler and see what they say.
3,RAZR battery,"I had troubles with the phone and did not know if it was the battery or the phone. I received the battery and charged it. I had the same problems, so I got a new phone."
1,NOT good,"Great price on this batter so I did not expect it to be like new, but at least to give me a couple of month of good use. Was very disappointed with this battery, it did not retain charge for more than a couple of hours. I still have to charge my phone every day. Do not recommend."
1,Not worth it,These batteries were no better than the 3 year old batteries in our Razr phones. We still have to charge them every other day at the least.
1,not satisfied with product,The battery is listed as black and the one they sent is white ...the battery need charging after each call...no life at all
1,POS,Lousy battery. Apparent fake Motorola emblem. Won't hold a charge for a full day. Shipping it back costs more than the battery so it's a lose/lose situation.
4,Replacement Battery,"It does not appear to be brand new but is 10x better than what my husband had before. Well packaged, Shipped quickly, Seemingly Good Seller. Would use again."
5,great battery,last a long time. better than the original battery. great buy and customer service. fast shipping. will definitely recommend you guys. thanks a lot.
1,It doesn't Fit!,"Had to return the batteries (BR 50) for my Razor V3 phones. Tied them on the two (2) phones that I have and found the batteries are made just a bit too small, causing them to jar loose and turning the phone off while carrying it and during conversations. Awaiting a refund now."
3,Short charge life,"Even though I did full charges and discharges for the first week or so to condition it, this battery does not seem to give me as long a life as the original battery. Also, witht he old battery, I get 20 minutes talk time once the phone indicates a low battery condition. With this battery, I get about 3 minutes warning, if that. For $4, I guess I can't complain, but I expected a little more.Update. After about 4 months, the battery completely died. I wanted to knock this down to 1 star, but they would not allow it. Be smart, buy the extra life bubble battery and cover.Unless you like to throw your money into the trash can, AVOID at all costs."
1,Disappointed,"The price for this battery seemed great. Then, shipping cost as much if not more than the battery, even though it was sent via USPS in a small padded envelope. I think I got nicked for 6-8 bucks for shipping a battery that weighed less than an ounce. When I received the battery I charged it overnight. From day one, it held a charge for about one day of moderate use, and the charge indicator goes from green to dead. I realize this is a vendor - I won't buy from them again."
1,Junk - not even worth $3,"As with others, received it in a timely fashion and it appeared to be new and matched what my original battery looked like. Doesn't hold a charge more than 5-6 hours even if I don't make a single call. Seller was quickly asking me for feedback and I gave positive feedback because it arrived quickly and worked at first... I think the only reason they have so many positive reviews is that they try to get the feedback quickly before people realize their product is junk. I think Amazon should boot this seller off the site."
4,Great replacement,"My battery was dieing after about 2 years of use and was flaky. I stopped in a couple retail stores cingular/alltel ect. to purchase another battery it was 60. I knew that was a joke and came on here and found the upgraded BR50 different batteries then when the razr first came out. It works well even though my original battery claimed 3.6V and this one is 3.7V it still works fine and my usage time is back to normal. Don't get a battery from your retail store it's a ripoff, get this one, this one is also a legitimate Motorola battery with hologram and everything."
2,Just OK,I ordered two because I knew they would be lackluster. And they are. But at least they are cheap. Why on earth is the most popular phone on earth equiped with thse lame batteries???
1,New? Yeah Right!!!,"Isn't there an option to give zero stars?!?! I bought this battery for my wife's phone whose original battery would not hold a charge. When buying it through Amazon.com VibeCellular claims that the battery is new and packaged. When I received the battery it was not packaged, not new and damaged to a point where it took some time just to get it into the phone. Do not buy from these liars and cheats. Just buy a new one."
1,My V3C call this an invalid battery,"I purchased this from Accessory One. My RAZR V3C says it's an invalid battery, and displays the ""<B"" symbol. The phone will not function with it. The original battery still works, so it's not the phone. The old battery just won't provide much talk time any more.The battery is not worth returning, so I'll just scrap it, and not buy any more batteries from Amazon or its affiliates.Jim"
1,Skip this purchase and keep looking,"I received this battery in early April and it's already dead. I'm not a heavy cell phone user, I charged it properly...as far as I know (no charging instructions) and here it is mid July and it won't hold a charge. Drop off was real fast too! I started to suspect something was going wrong only a few days ago. Still for the price, i can't really complain but now I'm out a phone until I can find a replacement."
2,Got what I paid for..,The first battery held a charge for maybe 6 hours. I contacted MyNetDeals and the very same day they sent me another one. I am using that battery but the charge only lasts two days at the most.
2,Broke,"It is a 2 piece rod, that locks together. The locking mechanism broke the 1st time i used it, now duck tape makes it a 1 pc rod."
3,Good story with tons of typos.,"I liked the book-characters, plot and locations-but come on Don, you're an accomplished author. Who's editing your work? The typos are terrible! Maybe it was the Kindle version...The story itself was solid but there are huge passages that grind things to a halt. I hate having to skim from boredom but there are a few places where the reader can click through multiple pages and not lose any of the core story.Not a must buy but a fun, suspensful read."
3,A Cool Breeze on the Underground,".The begining does not produce anything of any great note, but it builds into an interesting scenario towards the end."
4,Pre-school material,"Readiness exercises that do good job of getting small handsused to following lines to form straight lines, curves, andcircles before actually beginning the task of forming letters.My granddaughter also enjoys the pictures available for coloring."
4,Not Donna-Marie Pye,"Best-Loved Slow Cooker RecipesThis is a lovely, big hard cover book with glossy pages and lots of full page pictures. This is not a book by Donna-Marie Pye; it is by Publications International. I did not catch the error on this listing when I ordered. The recipes seem simple and easy prep, with ingredients that are available at your local supermarket. In all fairness, I gave it four stars as it is a nice book and I enjoy browsing through it; even though its not the book I wanted. I bought it used and it would have been too much trouble to return it; I am a ""can't have too many cookbooks"" type of person."
3,Not Impressed,"I'm disappointed with this book. I was looking for something with quick man-pleasing recipes using common ingredients. These recipes require too much prep, and often use odd stuff like dry wine and pearl onions. Just the thought of trying to find some of these ingredients at my grocery store deters me from trying any of the recipes."
5,Lots of Choices,This cookbook is filled with lots of great recipes of many kinds. I have found more useful and very tasty recipes in this book than any of the other slow cooker cookbooks I have. It is well-organized and the directions are very clear. I highly recommend it for someone who has just gotten or is getting a slow cooker. Is a great source of new ideas for someone who already has a slow cooker.
1,Beware ordering from this company,This company carries poor quality merchandise and does not stand behind it's advertisements. On many of their products they offer packages of 6 but only send you one flimsy product.
5,A book worth sharing,"A truly practical guide to experiencing the presence of God in one's life. This is a page-turner. It makes a great gift. I have given a copy to my dad and mom, my sister, my co-worker. I plan to give additional copies as Christmas presents and you should too. You might change the direction of someone's life for the better."
5,ABC's of a genuie Christian experience,I found this book very inspiring. Mr. Hohnberger has a way of cutting through the rhetoric and jargon of Christianity and revealing the very practical principles of how to know God in the 21st century. I would recommend this book to any person who feels their life experience unfulfilling and to any Christian that wants to go deeper with God.
5,Great Book,"This was a wonderful book, I highly recommend it!!It takes you into a deeper experience with God.Something we all need this day and time,Thanks for the experience"
5,A God that cares about the little things!,"As a mother of 4 boys, I often feel overworked and stressed as the duties of daily life DEMAND my attention. I often make mistakes and I have often felt like it is impossible to lead the life that Christianity alludes to but always seems just out of reach. Reading Escape to God gave me renewed courage and insight into how to really have a personal walk with Jesus as a best friend. Any mother feels a need for insights into how to be a better person as life presses in upon her. I would declare that any person who wants to not be led by circumstances but be renewed into a closer walk with God must read this book. It has changed my life."
5,Great for the history buff in your life!,"I bought this book as a Christmas present for my nephew, who is a history major in college. He loved it and now has spoken with the author on several occasions. It is evidently used as a textbook and makes for a wonderful course. (It was MUCH cheaper here than at other sources.)"
2,Not that great,"I did not really like this book. I had to force myself to finish it. It was not badly written, but I did not like the characters. Right in the beginning the heroine is shown to be vain and rather selfish and self-serving. I could not bring myself to like her after her unfavorable introduction. The hero is an annoying and whiny. I would not recommend this book."
2,Ho - Hum,"Artsy-fartsy.Good quality recording, good quality musicianship, but the ""pulse"" of the music doesn't do it for me. IMO, it pulls me back out of the music the same way a single skip of a record would. Too bad, because some of the tracks are good, but then the ""pulse"" brings me back out of the groove."
3,ALRIGHT,I PURCHASED THIS MESSAGE BELIEVING IT WAS T.D JAKES PREACHING BUT IT WAS ACTUALLY A SERMON BY REVEREND JAKIE MCULLOUGH IT WAS A GOOD MASSAGE JUST NOT JAKES BUT STILL O.K
4,Only worth reading for description of equipment,"If this is the only book you expect to ever read about the mummified Neolithic corpse found in the ice in 1991 then buy it. It is worth reading for the excellent and detailed description of the equipment which belonged to this long dead being. If, however, you have watched the PBS show on ice mummies or read some of the monographs on the subject on the Net, you realize that much of Spindler's book is baseless conjecture and that he omits important medical data. Bottom line: when a really excellent and definitive volume on the Ice Man is written this book will be relegated to the out of print section of Amazon books. I felt hungry and dissatisfied when I finished this book which, by the way, took me two hours to read. It is very light reading."
5,Does the job.,"A/V cables have a simple job to do: deliver signals with accuracy, free of interference. I have learned from experience that one can pay too little and live to regret it. I have also spent way too much (and lived to regret it). These Belkin cables seem to be just right. They have the tactile feel of quality and deliver excellent picture and sound with my satellite receiver."
3,'The King and I' revamped.,"This tale bares a close resemblance to ' The King and I' movie. The names have been changed to protect the author. Anna has been dubbed as Madamoiselle Gillian, a dyslexic, american teacher/tutor, who specializes in dyslexia. While the King of Siam takes on a lesser role of Crown Prince of Marceau, Michel, who is also a widower with a seven year old, dyslexic, lonely son named Max.A great but hackneyed romance story plot. Of course Gillian marries the Prince and Max's dyslexia problem is resolved in six weeks. Max also gets to keep the beagle, Elvis."
3,The book was ok but not good enough to reccomend,"I wish that someone would rewrite this book because the idea that the authors had was great.The book was hard to follow; I found myself going back numerous times to recheck things. The enterprise objects framework was very advanced and well coded in a lot of areas, but I don't like the way that it handled retrieving data from a data base. So as I learned some good things from this book it was harder to learn than it should have been. One thing that I love about this book is that they give you the source for their object builder tool. I don't use the tool. I have my own but it's nice to see them giving theirs away."
1,What about deployment?!,"There are a zillion books about .NET. I was hoping this one would cover deployment as the title promises. DON'T BE FOOLED!Where is the information about Strong Naming, about how to get things into the GAC, about the line item tools like sn.exe, gacutil.exe, resgen.exe, al.exe (come on!)What about the <assembly: ...> classes in AssemblyInfo.vb ??No wonder only two of the authors put their faces on it. POOR"
2,This is the worst book I've ever read,"Although some customer here have given this book a 5-star evaluation, I don't agree with them. In my opinion, this book is one of the worst books I've read. Actually, most of books from Wrox press is very bad, especially not good for beginners.If you want to make yourself confusing with the new .Net technology, read this book. Otherwise, find some other book such as Sams Teach Yourself series books."
5,Unbelievable,"This is an unbelievable disc. Norman's voice is suited to this repertoire very well and the largeness of her voice is evident in this performance. I could listen to the Liebestod over and over again. The climatic moment of the piece will give you goosebumps, it is just such a powerful piece of music and Norman and Colin Davis are quite sensitive to dynamics, phrasing, and tempo. This disc shows off the beauty of Norman's voice to the maximum."
4,"Good blender, good price","Oster makes great blenders. This was a perfect budget blender; it works well and is easy to use. The plastic jar is not as nice as their glass jars, but for the price I can't complain. I just wish the top was solid; the center piece can pop into the blender if you're not careful."
2,not much,"pretty much what you would expect for so cheap, o.k. for mixing drinks but not much more, very flimsy..........cheap but so was the price"
2,Not so great,"My daughter and I purchased this to make smoothies for breakfast. The motor is not strong enough to really blend so you have to keep it running for a few minutes, states it is dishwasher safe but after a few washings the handle just cracked off. A replacement would be $16.99 and I paid a few dollars more for the whole unit. You get what you pay for when you try to save money on something cheap."
1,I wouldn't recommend it.,"Very low quality, the plastic surface is very cheap. The buttons on the device are wobbly. I used to have an Oster blender some years ago and I loved it but this one doesn't even come close quality wise! I wouldn't recommend it."
3,Blender,I needed a cheap blender and this one fit the bill. Does exactly what I needed and makes a nice smoothie.
1,mr charlie payne,"would not use this product anymore nor would i tell any one to by this item , does not work very well. shakes to much to use."
3,they are okay,they are not as durable so try not to leave these on for a long period of time or else they will start to smoke i dont know if its just the one i had or what but after using it for i think less than 5 minutes it started smoking and i call amazon and they replaced it for me so i'm not careful on how long i have it on so beware.
2,"Too hard, wrist hurts more","Thin, very soft layer over narrow hard wrist pad -Felt ok at first, but after a few long days wrist pain got much worse.The top layer is too soft and the whole rest is too smallfor a tall man with heavy arms."
2,"great surface, bad wrist pad","I was hoping that, despite reading a few less than glowing reviews, I would be able to rave about this mousepad. Unfortunately not the case. I have been without a mouse pad for awhile and wanted something comfy for my wrist. I picked this one and got it and it felt great...for about 3 days. Now there is a huge indentation in the wrist gel (I've had it for maybe 2 weeks if that) and my wrist sits on the hard portion underneath. I will be looking for a better pad with more wrist protection and I will be heading the reviews on the next one...I gave it two stars because the actual mouse pad space for moving the mouse is perfect, not too big, not too small."
2,Not Really,"I've been using this product for about a year and honestly, I'm disappointed. The memory foam wrist cushion feels nice at first, but it compresses over time and eventually you're resting your hand on a solid rock. I use my mouse a lot, mostly for gaming, and I've been experiencing a lot of pain in my hand, partly due to the constant pressure on the heel of my hand from this mouse pad."
2,Could be better,"For a small person with small hands, I find this wrist pad too high and too hard. From other reviews, it sounds like it does soften slightly with use. I think the issue is with the memory foam...it needs some breaking in. A soft gel pad would probably be better for me.---------------------I examined the pad closely, and could feel this extra hard layer underneath the foam. I decided to do some surgery on it, and cut it open at the seam, and was able to cut/rip out the 1/4 inch think layer. I then glued the pad back together. It is now BEAUTIFUL! Removing that layer made all the difference for me. So the pad does not look quite as pretty, and it is a little bit of work, but who cares. I am now very happy with it."
2,you get what you pay for,"i don't know why this pad has gotten such a high rating. in my opinion, it's kind of cheap but i guess that's why it was $6.99. it will do the job but had i spent a little more money i would have ended up with a wrist pad that was better quality.when i'm resting my wrist for awhile, the pad squish's down and it no longer feels good or soft. but my lazer mouse tracks just fine on the pad.it does the job of functioning as a mouse pad but the wrist rest is not the best. so if you're doing a lot of hours on your computer, i'd search for another brand or model."
2,Provides little support...,"I am disappointed with this product. I work on a computer all day and this product worked great for about a week, but then the gel in the wrist pad started getting soft. Now my wrist sinks into the middle of the pad as the gel moves to the side providing little support. I would not recommend this product for anyone who spends a lot of time at their computer."
2,quality issues?,"Straight out of the package, the sides of this mousepad curl up... which doesn't make sense, since it was packed flat. Maybe they'll settle out with time, but disappointing. Also, this thing smells bad. Again, that may fade with time, but it's distracting."
1,buy something else,"I ended up giving this mousepad away because it doesnt work with my logitech g5 optical mouse. I suppose if you have a crappy ball mouse or something cheap it might work, but this pad is far from what I expected, I get better traction on a $1 square pad. I'm forced to still use my old pad that I've had for over a year until I find something better. Cheers."
5,best one I have ever had,Great mouse pad. The extra padding really does feel very comfortable--worth a couple extra dollars.
3,A Little Akward To Use,"The foam pad is a little high, and I always run out of room and have to pick up the mouse and drag it back. It's really good quality though. And the foam is really thick and cushioned."
2,Foam gets hard.,"As others have mentioned, the foam on this gets hard after a while. No idea why. Even at the cheap price, not really worth it. Definitely regret getting this."
3,mouse pad,"I like this product but hoped that it would be slightly larger than the usual mouse pad. I like the wrist rest but it is somewhat confining and an extra inch in diameter of the pad, would be helpful."
4,"A 4.5 if I could, but I can't","I liked this mouse pad, though it did take me a couple of days to really get used to it. When I first bought it, it was very hard and uncomfortable and I thought I had made a mistake. So I took a hammer and hit it a few times out of frustration, but that actually seemed to soften up the wrist pad. It is by no means real memory foam, but after a good hammering and some light use I found it quite comfortable. The fabric does feel a bit cheap, and the logo is in a different spot from the picture, but overall I am very happy.Works perfectly with my microsoft x5 gaming mouse and my craigslist table, I have noticed 0 performance interruptions or hindrances with it.Overall, it isn't the best but it is far from the worst, I love it."
5,"Comfortable, affordable, Sufficient real estate without cluttering your desk.","Nice buy given its price. I have been using this only for a few days now but am wondering how come I never got one of these before. While buying the product, I thought that it may be a bit small but it turned out that this mousepad has way much more real estate than you will actually need if you are using a sensitive mouse.At the same time, it does not clutter my desk unnecessarily. Dont be put off by the oval shape. Quite frankly, a rectangular one would have been an unnecessary waste of space since you rest the heel of your hand on the memory foam and simply move your fingers to make the pointer go where you want to go. Its a great product for daily use though I would not recommend it for power gamers. Though not a gamer myself, I believe gamers will want to look for a smoother mouse pad where your mouse can glide more effortlessley."
2,Nothing Spectacular,"A thin surface--make that a very thin surface. The part where you put your wrist is comfortable, I'll give it that, but no different, positive or negative, from other brands with the same design. I had another (unknown) brand that became discolored, faded, and indented after about a year, so I got this one, and that is what happens to this type of mouse pad with the wrist support--no matter the brand you buy. It can't be helped. It is nice while it lasts, but don't expect it to last a long time. You will see an easing of tension in your wrist, but it is extremely thin and cheaply manufactured. Sorry I bought it."
3,Its ok,"I bought this to help stop[ wrist pain associated with the mouse, unfortunately it has not solved the problem. Also the surface is not for a gamer, so I had to take my razor mouse pad and cut it out and over lay it on top of this one. The wrist pad part is just okay, nothing to rave about."
4,is what it is,"it works fine. We have it hanging over the side of our angled shower glass enclosure (we figure hanging it over the door would just make it ""clang"" and ""bang"" everytime the door was opened). No rust yet (it's been up for a month) and I think it will probably be hanging there for a long, long time."
3,Caddy is ok,The shower caddy products seem to tend to be poorly designed as the top rack to store shampoo bottles in is not tall enough to prevent bottles from tipping out of the caddy when this 'over the door' caddy is sitting on a door being opened and closed. Probably would have been better to go into a store and look for one there.DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS SELLER IF YOU DISLIKE HAVING YOUR INFORMATION RENTED OR SOLD TO OTHER CATALOGS. THAT IS WHAT THEY DID WHEN I ASKED TO BE REMOVED FROM THEIR LIST.
3,A little disappointed,"I'd thought that a stainless steel organizer wouldn't rust, but it has started. Granted, it's not as bad as others I've had in the past, but it's only been about 6 weeks. I had hoped it would have lasted longer than that."
1,"Sorry, Not Her Best","There were several things I didn't like about this book.First, it was a reprint of 2 books written in the eighties and this wasn't made clear in the promo material at Amazon.Second, both stories were the type of romances that I don't care for; with overbearing men who force kisses on the helpless female character. She says no but means yes.It is not a book I will recommend to anyone."
4,"garlock reading is the best reading ""page after page""","DOROTHY GARLOCK NEVER FAILS TO ENTERTAIN ME. SHE OFFERS THE BEST COMBINATION OF ROMANCE, LOCALITY INTRIQUE, AND HUMAN EMOTIONS. WISHMAKERS MEETS ALL OF THE ABOVE."
1,DO not use ANY labels!,"Down the line, it will cause problems for your computer to read these discs. Got one cd with label stuck in my iMac right now, it won't come out. I now use an external reader/writer, and it has problems with labeled cd's, so does my car cd-player and my regular cd player (and I don't buy junk electronics). Just be safe, use a permanent marker to label your discs, may not look as cool, but at least you can still use them. I've used various brands labels in the past (Avery, Memorex, others) and all mess up your discs."
4,These labels are very good,"These labels are good- matte white finish, handle in my Brother ink jet printer fine.I would prefer a glossy photo paper finish to look more like professional labels, but these are OK."
3,I got the wrong one really,I like this product but I thought I got the dvd version. It still works though. I do wish that the template was more user friendly. I would probably look for something different next time.
2,New slick finish doesn't print well,"I've been using Avery Matte White CD Labels 8691 for a few years now and have been very happy with the product. Just reordered and this latest batch has a new slick finish. It doesn't print nearly as well as the old finish, which was a little rough and could grab the ink. This results in a loss of image detail. The ink just sits on top of the label and is prone to smearing. I had excellent results with the rougher surface and am very disappointed with this change in the product. I'll have to look for another brand now."
3,Consider that these will make your disc thicker,"These make a very nice label and you can download the template from Avery.com. However when I tried to insert them into the CD player in my car and my Bose radio/CD player they would not load because they were too thick. Also, put in another CD player and after a short time the music was distorted because the weight was thrown off. Although the CD's look great they are now just coasters for my beer. So, it's back to my Sharpie."
4,Good CD Labels,"I do lots of data storage on DVD/CD, so knowing what the contents of each disc is becomes a must-know. With these labels I know what the contents are, and the labels print well in either an inkjet or laser printer."
5,Wonderful new product!,"This great scrub is an awesome makeup remover. Light and not powerfully overscented, it's perfect for either a quick morning cleaning or an extra midday cleaning, as needed."
5,A real Neil Diamond fan loves this music,"I love pop music, especially Neil Diamond and need instumental renditions for creating dressage musical freestyles. This is really well done music, retains the true flavor of Diamond and carries a wonderful beat. Not elevator music at all."
1,did not receive it yet and paid for fast shipment,"Paid for fast shipment and did not receive it, orders 4 others cd's and they arrived on time or before"
1,AMAZON did u screw up??,"Yes, the discs contain all of the episodes I was looking for. But NO,they are NOT uncensored. I'm not sure if its a miscommunication, but any and all profanity is bleeped out. The discs say 5.1, which they are not. They are 2.0 stereo. Add the fact that my season 2 box was ripped with center disc holder broken. Im not sure if they packed the wrong discs, or if its just advertised incorrectly, but I am left puzzled as to why I paid so much money when I could have bought them individually and saved $$ seeing how they were going for about $15 a piece. The easter eggs are there, but they are on the $15 version as well..I fully feel like I got screwed..STAY AWAY!"
2,displeased,"One would think that judging from the improvement in Cleopatra's gothic compilations that the same might apply to their industrial releases. This isnt so. Unfortunately the selection of bands presented on 3 disks is far too limited, and while the music is good, its a disappointment to those well versed in the genre. You need a bigger variety of bands. A good rule of thumb: not more than one track by the same band per disk. The only reasons to buy this album are: 1. Its cheap... (which it is... hence two stars and not one) 2. You are new to industrial music, and need an introduction. (this is only partially successful, as some of the bands included are more in the electro-dance vein...)Shame on you Cleo... we know you can do better..."
2,Limited Appeal; Inflexible Format Somewhat Disinteresting,"THis is a collection of Ellery Queen Mystery Magazine short stories. Set in a 1920s small New England town, the author struggles to keep one interested...the format is too restrictive. Small selection of rather uninteresting characters to draw from. Fans of this book should definitely get the early 70s TV series DVDs of ""Banacek"", which also features impossible crimes presented in a talky, low key style."
2,Falling Down,"A forbidding book because ultimately it's about Moorcock and his self conscious attachment to himself. It's in the writing. Morrcock can't help it. Not for me, this book."
5,from a guy perspective,i ordered this book as a gift for someone- and ended up reading it myself. maybe somehthing like this can be created for guys! but i like know about how women handle all these things- now i have the inside scoop!
5,Awesome Book!!,Newly married and on my own this book is an easy how to guide for the married but independant woman. LOVE IT!!!
4,Who thought of this?!?!?!,"More than anything I find this little guide to be extremely creative. Unfortunately, when life's troubles come along, I don't immediately remember to whip out my ""MG guide to life"" but I have read some very useful tips in there that I will never forget and some have certainly come in handy at times. If you already know how to cook everything, clean everything, fix anything....you might still even like this book just because of it's good humor and because the author clearly put a lot of time and thought into it. I think every modern girl should have one and it makes a perfect gift for friends. I can't wait to get the modern girl's guide to motherhood once I become a parent!"
5,Every Girl Needs a Little Help....,"I love, love, love this book. I am a huge fan of the tv show and when I saw the book I had to have it. I've been on my own for several years and have learned some of this stuff the hard way but this book is packed with useful tips to make your life easier and more fabulous. This book is for every girl who takes pride in being independent, stylish, and smart-- or one who wants to become that way. I bought this book for my brother's girlfriend as a college graduation gift. She's definitely stylish and smart and well on her way to being independent. I think every girl should be given this book when she goes out on her own."
3,overall okay,"Packed with practicle tips for a modern woman that some of us might have missed. Very nicely written, with a lot of sense of humor. Some advices, however, were well known... (at least to me), so I wasn't too overwhelmed by it, as expected. Would still recommned it for women aged 18-25."
1,Don't waste your MONEY,There is no VALUABLE information whatsoever in this book.All the good reviews are probably from Vendors and friends.I want my money back!
4,"Cute, with some helpful suggestions","From everything to cooking to decorating, to buying your first home to minor emergencies, Buckingham covers it all in an amusing lighthearted manner."
4,Good Book!,Lots of cool information. I would like to check out the other books from this author too.
3,Maybe I just expected too much from it,"Because of all the 5 star reviews, I thought this guide was going to be extremely helpful. Unfortunately, the book was not nearly as helpful as I expected it to be. A lot of the things mentioned are just pure common sense. I give it 3 stars because the cover and layout is very cute, but the layout itself could have been organized better for easier navigation. I did learn a few helpful hints from it, which is another reason I give it 3 stars. All in all, I wish I hadn't gotten it. I will probably donate it to my library. I wouldn't really recommend it."
3,Great Ending,"Above all else, I like how neatly everything was tied together. The reunited lovers and their history together, was a huge bonus."
3,A little too general,This would be a great book for someone new to working on cars. I felt they tried to include too many models to be specific. The pictures and diagrams are usually not of my truck. The general information and the plan of action/troubleshooting sections are good.
4,Beautiful Playing But Poor Interpretation,"For a budget priced disc recorded all the way back in the late 60's, this is a surprisingly high quality CD in terms of both sound quality as well as the playing. Portal and Pludermacher played very musically and well balanced each other. I especially have to compliment Pludermacher's performace: he brought a lot of strength to the studio that day. Portal on the other hand, didn't seem to give the Brahms sonatas their full credit. Though he did seem to be in good control of his playing, music of Brahms just simply can't be played with that big of an vibrato Portal has as well as seemingly often dragged tempos.If you could get over Portal's vibrato, this is an enjoyable performance at a nice price. However, if you're serious about studying this piece, I'd suggest shelling out the 8 more bucks and get the renowned Dave Shifirin recording."
3,Brendel vs. Dieskau,"It's time to vote who excels the most in this recording. I bought this recording prior to my recital to learn the interpretation of one of the greatest lieder singer. Personally, I did not like his interpretation. I had a sense that Dieskau seemed rushing. The singing is somewhat unstable. I gave this CD to my accompanist, and she said this was the best Dichterliebe recording she ever heard. She meant the Brendel part, not Dieskau. I recommend Wunderlich."
2,Fischer-Dieskau not in prime voice,"Just heard this on the radio. Unfortunately, Fischer-Dieskau sounded past his prime; his top notes were strained and even occasionally flat. His lower range was still beautiful. Brendel's piano-playing was great."
3,Crazy Crew,"The VHS tape arrived in a timely manner. The box was in fairly good shape. The video itself was a little fuzzy, but watchable. The movie, however, was not as funny as I remember when I first watched it thirty years ago. I am a huge fan of the characters, but in this movie I thought they were a little silly. They have since developed into wonderful stars."
2,Two hours of Cheese and an Aerial Shot That's All-Time,"That's the short of it. Not a whole lot of foos going on in this film. They talk about it, dream about it, even fight about it...but when push comes to shove, Longshot Kids is seriously lacking in foos footage. The major exception occurs at the World Championship of Foosball when an aerial trick shot makes the preceeding two hours suddenly seem worthwhile. Considering the movie is entirely devoted to the sport of foosball (and subsequently is one of a kind) and is filmed in the 80s with an archetypal soundtrack, avid players and cult critics are sure to find something redeemable in this film."
3,"Ok movie, really bad audio.......","The sound on this tape is THE WORST. It's like AM radio being played through a pillow. The movie follows two friends as they try to earn money for a trip to Europe (they dream of becoming pro soccer players). They play foosball to win the money for their trip and along the way Leif Garrett falls for a French girl. That's about it. Oh yeah, a young Linda Manz (the mother from Gummo)is also in it. It's got some humor, but it is mostly a drama. Garrett is ok in this, but his best film is still the 1978 Tony Alva classic, Skateboard: The Movie. Find it if you can. Foosball anyone?"
2,Spoiled by Vince Flynn,"Read about 50 pages and gave up. It was just too slow. I'm sure some folks will like it just fine, but just not my cup of tea."
3,Wrong Narrator for this Book,"This was totally the wrong narrator for this story. This narrator should be reviewing the club scene around Dupont Circle in D.C. or talking about Fashion Week in Milan not reading this military & political heavy story.It's a good story. Lots of suspense, topic is very relevant, and good characters but it was ruined by the narration."
2,Not Representative of Shep's Greatness,"Maybe I'm in a minority, but this disc really left me flat. While it had its clever moments, I found the presentation to be rather stagey, almost hoakey, like Shep wrote out his bits verbatim and gave them to Mister Rogers to read. Where's the inspired downtown 1950s hip ad libbing and quirkiness? You'll see what I mean if you compare this disc to the other Shep album that's been reissued on CD ""Will Failure Spoil."" That's the one to get.Jean Shepherd was a radio genius, but you won't hear that here."
2,a real yawner,"The bantam versions of these ST books are in general inferior to their pocket book competitors. The only need that this book would fulfill is to have something with the characters one knows, so that one can commune with them for a little while.The plot of this is insipid and unoriginal: a superior being, who is nuts, is playing with them and gets them into danger. He happens to be an organian, those throbbing balls of light who enforced a peace with the Klingons.This is nothing to remember, just a rehash of well known scifi and comic book traditions, however well it is executed. I was growing bored of these treatments at the time I read it, and looking at it again briefly, I have absolutely no desire to read it again.Not recommended."
1,Floppy,"This book is totally terrible. Confusing. It doesn't make sense. It is full of inaccuracies.For example, if Romulans in Goldin's pathetic excuse for a story are honorable, then why did the Romulan try to shoot a defenseless woman? Second thing is this book is racist stuff. If Goldin cited all Klinons are treacherous, then he must be implying all Germans are nazis, Irish are alcoholics and terrorists, etc. I would not say those words. I don't even imply them."
1,Made in Pakistan,Made in Pakistan - If you think this piece of junk is made in the USA - you're kidding yourself. The cost of this thing is highly overrated.The handles on this thing are coming loose already and I've used it for 5 minutes.
3,Confusing and Sad,"This is NOT what I expected--I expected an actual story of slaves and their experiances but instead it is a book of a Play told in story form, where it gets confusing and frustrating trying to piece together who goes with whom. The author also leaves you hanging in the end--the final chapter starts out as if there is more then suddenly it ends and is over--nothing more. Many threads were left untied and hanging and those that weren't were short and not too sweet--very confusing but great on historical facts aside those which were also short not much to this book and certainly not worth buying--borrow it from the library instead."
4,Very Cute,"It's just adorable, that's all I can say. Pooh's ears and feet also crinkle, I didn't expect that. My 6-month-old has already had it all in her mouth and it's standing up to her abuse so far."
1,Disappointment,"Before even unwrapping this product completely I knew it was poorly made and should not have been shipped. The top piece of the cart was peeled and gouged out. There was nothing wrong with the box, so clearly this item should not have been shipped when it was in no condition to be sold. Highly disappointed and now I have to go through the hassle of returning something of such poor quality."
3,Shaky,It does the job but was really shaky. I never put the wheels on (never planned on rolling it around) but I did reenforce the top and the bottom to the legs with angle brackets and that did eliminate some of the shakiness.
3,"Functional, but not a pretty piece of furniture","Quick delivery, and packaging and instructions were fine, but it took almost an hour (and several improvised tools) to pound the wheels into the too-narrow holes in the legs. The ""natural finish"" looks like unfinished wood; a coat of paint or stain may be needed to dress it up. Wood quality is also rough, and glued seams show on the shelves. The table folds as promised, so it's functional as a rolling desk that I'll put away for company, but it's not a piece to be shown off in the kitchen."
3,Disappointed!,"I like the style and color but the workmanship is awful. The first shelf is not level due to the supports on one side being higher than the other side and both shelves are not tight to the sides due to said supports sticking out too far and are loose in the slots for them under the shelves. When I use the printer, the whole stand shakes so much I have to hold it still. I've had experience with inserting casters on other furniture with no problem but these didn't pop in like the others. I had to twist them while I leaned hard pushing them down making the whole assembly process take over two hours. After all that, I don't want to go thru the trouble of taking it apart to return it. From now on, I will definitely give the bad reviews more consideration and, needless to say, will never buy another Winsome product."
4,Nice cart,"This is a really well made cart. The packaging was unbelievable, it took me longer to unpack it than to put it together! Perfect shape. Only two things: the middle shelf has to be completely removed to fold it (then what do you do with it??) and when you fold it, it doesn't stand on its own...and it has casters. So I have to figure out where to put it when it's folded...doesn't work in the place I'd imagined for it. But other than that, it's really sturdy and nice looking. I would have bought it sooner but they wanted a huge shipping charge...got an email when it went to Super Saver Shipping and ordered it the same day. Well worth it."
4,Versatile table,"I ordered this table so I can scan pictures in any room of my house. I use the bottom shelf for those items to be scanned, the next one up for the laptop and the top shelf for the scanner/printer. There is some difficulty in moving the cart when loaded because it is designed to be folded and has give in several joints."
5,EXCELLENT FOLDING TABLE,"We have an RV. My last RV had a fold out wall mount table behind the passenger seat. No wall mount in this RV, it has a ceiling to floor window behind the passenger seat. I've really missed not having a place to put our laptops @ printer. This table fits perfectly in the space behind the seat. Very well made. Almost no assembly .... unpack, tap wheels in legs, unfold, slide middle shelf into it's brackets, @ then four screws to put the top on .... done. Less than 30 minutes. I had no problems as discribed in the bad reviews."
4,Its a very useful product,"What you see is what you get. The wood color is exactly the same in the picture. It does the job. Although Its a little wiggly and the when you pull it sometimes the hinges separates, over all it's good."
4,Lovely and practical,"This is a great little roll away cart that can be used for all kinds of purposes. We bought two and use one for our grandson's toys, and the other for our bedroom tv. Our tv is 48 inches and a bit heavy. In addition, we have a rug in our bedroom, which concerned us in terms of . So we added some L-brackets to improve its strength while rolling across the run. If we had been using this for a smaller tv and/or rolling it upon a wooden floor, I don't think we would have needed the L-brackets, but we wanted to be safe. As a consequence, we've ruined the finish a bit but one could use supportive brackets that are more inconspicuous than the ones we just happened to have laying around."
4,Pretty good,"I was pleasantly surprised at the solid wood. Really pretty attractive. I was a little disappointed that they used a few pieces they shouldn't have. Little wood flaws here and there. On the underside of the lid, which I know, doesn't show, there is a large flaw the size of a playing card that was patched with wood filler. But all in all, pretty nice.If I had my way this table would not be foldable. The middle shelf does not attach, but just sits in place so it adds a bit to the shaken feeling. I don't believe its weak, it just moves a bit more than I like. I might remove the casters which would make it a little more stable. Certainly well worth the price."
3,Suitable for my purposes,"I wanted a cart that I could roll around the house that could also be easily stored when not in use. At first blush this cart suits my needs. I liked that the cart was very easy to put together and it folds away quickly. When it's folded I can slide the second shelf into the space between the bottom shelf and the legs and it stays in place, eliminating my concern about where to store that second shelf when the cart wasn't in use. I gave this cart 3 stars because it's a bit less sturdy than I'd like although not to the point that I'm afraid it will collapse unexpectedly. Also the caps provided to cover the holes for the screws don't stay in place. I may glue them in at some point."
5,Folding Printer Cart,"It's great! Easy to put together, easy to fold and unfold, great, affordable, moveable furniture. Perfect for the gypsy life."
1,Product idea is GREAT but not operational when delivered,"I bought your product on amazon and I was amazingly surprise of the very poor quality of the furniture.The screws (that your company screwed already) are not located on the same level therefore none of the planks/shelves (wood shelves) are stable. (the wood planks that should rely on the 4 screws rely on only 3 screws because of the screws not located on the same levels)=> And make the whole product completely unstable, unsteady, fragile and mostly unusable.The furniture cannot carry/support anything otherwise it will collapse.I had to unscrew the screws and screw them back on the same level.PS : The package was so heavy I decided to fix it myself instead of resend it back."
3,Hard to Put Wheels In,"To say that it was hard to put the wheels into this cart would be an understatement. It was almost impossible and I'm not convinced yet that I didn't splinter the wood somewhere, or a plastic wheel, in the process of doing that. I had to basically put all my weight (and I'm not small) on the wheel which A) has its axis off to one side so it REALLY stresses the plastic and B) doesn't have a good place to grab hold of it and wants to spin (it is a wheel, after all).Now that it is together, though, the stand is very nice, looks just the way the picture looks, and it holding three potted plants instead of the printer I think it was designed to hold."
2,Looks good - poor workmanship,"Cart arrived quickly. Packaging was fine and assembly was easy. Cart looks very nice - but the workmanship is terrible. The shelves do not fit securely making the cart very wobbly and shaky. When try to roll this cart the sides tended to pull away from the shelves causing the shelves to tip. I ended up having to screw the sides to the shelves and glue the top to firm this up, which of course made this no longer a foldable cart! Not worth the money in my opinion.Pros - Looks good, folds up as advertisedCons - very unstable, not useable without screwing together (negating the ""foldability"")"
2,Foldable Mission Cart,The stand/cart serves its purpose but the quality/workmanship is a bit questionable. One of the shelves was cracked and another shelf had a scuff mark on the surface. Not quite sure if the damage was due to poor workmanship or occurred during shipping.
1,"Delivered defective - twice! not glued together, falling apart","This cart is a nice design, nice size. This finish of the wood could be better - its composite rubberwood, or something like that. But you get what you pay for, and it would be fine and look ok for most casual furniture uses. If only the quality were better. I ordered this, it arrived with the side joints and mission slats not glued in and falling apart. Amazon sent me another one, and that one arrived in the same condition. I give up - I will find something else. I guess Winsome Wood just got a bad batch of these. But they should weed them out and not keep sending them to customers."
3,I Found This a Heavy Table,I am older and so I found the 30 plus lbs. justtoo much to deal with in assembly and wasnervous it could tip over on a small child.
4,Foldable Cart,This cart arrived packaged safely and had no flaws or imperfections.It is made of durable wood and has a proud design and cut.I am happy with my purchase and would recommend this particular model.
3,Good but difficult to get together,"Screws for the top shelf were extremely hard to get in, in fact I couldn't even get them all the way in. The middle shelf slides into metal hooks which should be easy to construct but the hooks didn't line up properly with the slots, I had to use quite a bit of force to bend the metal rungs to make them line up with the slots on the shelf.Once I finagled it together its a fine shelf, I see no reason for the problems with the middle shelf other than poor quality."
1,Extremely poorly made,Had a crack in wood on the top when it arrived. I figured I'd live with it rather than go through the bother of reboxing it and hauling it to the post office. The first time I moved it (gently) it completely came unglued and collapsed. Should be able to roll a rolling cart! I now have an expensive pile of firewood - too bad I don't have a fireplace.
5,ecellent Printer table for my Canon Pixma Pro 9000 MarkII,This Desk went together easy and fast. It looks real nice and my printer seat on it nicely. The self is real handy for you printer supplies.
1,Missing Parts,I will know how to rate it when I can put it together. The product looks like it might be useful. Wood looks strong and solid. I can not put it together because of missing parts. So annoying. Now I hope I will receive the parts soon and really be able to send in complete review.TS
5,Beautiful and elegant,"I knew by the time the Siciliano from the Concert in F had begun that this was going to be one of those recordings that I would never grow tired of. This Philips release is that rare musical occurance where everything is ideal...Bach's oboe concertos, Academy of St. Martin with Iona Brown, and Heinz Holliger's heart filling phrases ...not to mention full warm emersive sound engineering. If for no other reason, purchase this CD just to own a deeply satisfying instance of superb musical and technical virtuosity."
1,"Nice try, but not quite.","This was like a student film from a seminary. It was 37 minutes of awful acting. The idea had potential, but lost me completely between the awful acting and the failure to sell the story.These two ""kids"" get introduced to witchcraft, which sends them on a downward spiral. Said spiral mostly consisted of reading satanic texts, frantic scribbling of silliness on to post-it notes, and foreplay with razor blades, blood, candles, bad music and goth makeup. Their weird foreplay introduces them to a ""dark lord"" with a little girl as a sidekick, who commands them to kill a christian. Many silly scenes involving rape, knife-waving, demonic possession, etc. follow. I won't spoil the end for you.Overall it felt like a ""reefer madness"" style movie, to scare good little Christian kids into avoid the dangers of the occult. You never know what you might be inviting in, right? If it weren't for the occasional exposed breast, I could see this playing at a church youth group movie night."
2,Predictable as Obamas idiocy,"Nothing new. Not scary, not particularly well done. Almost not worth viewing. It isnt the worst movie I have ever seen but it is very, very forgetable. I do not recommend it to anyone."
3,A Little Bit of Thrill Kill Kult,"I bought this album because I saw Death Ride in concert with My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult. I was seriously impressed with the drummer/singer. At least three of the tracks are oustanding (the two version of 'needle' and 'Penetrator', one of the tracks is horrible, the rest are listenable. If you like MLWTTKK or Fast Metal music then I recommend this CD."
1,Out of date information,"The book is very out of date and not organized well at all. It does not answer more than 50% of the questions I had regarding this disease.At 186 pages (at least 1/3 was filler regarding general issues on healing and disease. . . something I could get from almost any web site on serious illness), this book is certainly not worth the expensive price. I would not recommend it at all. Visit the web sites specifically for thyroid cancer and you can educate yourself much morethoroughly than by buying this book."
3,Average,"This is a great overview for someone who has been recently diag. with Thyroid Cancer, however it is not overly indepth."
4,A JUMP START TO MY WRITING,"I looked to this product to give me a little push and shove into writing more and organizing my thoughts. So far, it has worked out pretty well for me. It has made me consider in more detail my character developments and conflicts. Don't expect it to write for you, but if you are looking for some organization it is well worth the price."
4,Nice and basic,"This is a great choice for those who haven't quite mastered the nuances of plot, and characterization, and conflict. Like myself. As can be expected, very few stories fit neatly into all of the visual formulas of the program. But, it gets your mind thinking, and tightens the ideas floating around your head into a cohesive story. Its fun too, lots of good examples."
1,A complete waste of my time and money,"I bought this hoping to use it as an editing tool for my writing. It is not at all what the description purports it to be. It has an extremely long learning curve and the user is expected to plug into the software writer's idea of novel creation, rather than provide tools of support to enhance or streamline the writing experience. The clipart employed for distinguishing the characters is completely hideous. I don't know who this product is intended for, but in my opinion, the description of the software's intended purpose is completely misleading. At the risk of sounding cliche, I would still say that this is a nightmare rather than a dream."
2,Expected a lot more,"I've written one book without the use of such software and I thought that it would be great to try this for a second book. I tried and only get words to come up and can never get it to form any type of story. I'm like another reviewer, ""Maybe I'm green to this."" I think I'll stick to the old fashion way. At least I can see something ""create"" before my eyes instead of wondering how to do it. Myhappiness goes out to those who can master this program."
1,A WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME,"I purchased the product two years ago when I was drafting my novel. I went through the menus and tried to use them to outline my story and characters... my head still hurts. I got some index cards and outlined each scene, character, narration and a year later self-published my novel. To this day I look at the cover box of this product and shake my head...then I suddenly stop, because I remember it makes my head hurt even more."
2,Misleading,"Perhaps I'm green to all of this, but in the description of Dreamkit 4.0 it states that there are templates for novels, screenplays etc. I thought a template was a formatted blank form to start on my screenplay with all the correct margins, formatted tabs et al. Well, once I called technical support, they admitted that ""the wording should have been clearer"" about the templates. There are no formatted forms. Also, for those who are not computer elitists, this program is confusing and frustrating. I ended up using the trial software (included) and found Screenwriter 2000 perfect, easy to understand and well organized. I learned the hard way, and ordered Sreenwriter 2000."
3,Don't Buy This Product: - Buy the Pro. Version or . . .,"""Writer's Dreamkit 4"" is lacking in features needed by serious writers - or those hoping to become serious writers.If you are really serious about writing for money, then purchase the more complete version of this software. Or, look over the software publishers full line of programs and purchase the software that will more closely fulfill your particular needs.Yes, you are on the right track."
3,As good as advertised.,"This product help you with development of of your storyline. It does not write the stories for you, but it will help you in making a better story."
1,Horrible and hard to get to work on my computer,There are books that are far more creative and interesting and more likely to help a writer get it out and on to the paper. I bought this thinking it would do just that. However it was problematic from the beginning just to get it to work on my com-puter and when it did smooth out a bit I realized why I do not like Hollywood and american movies as a rule: They are canned products.I do not know what the alternative is but this product is a waste of time and money.
2,Not what to be expected!,"I bought this because I am an inspiring romance writer. This was an ""ok"" program. It only lets you write everything you want to put in each scene and then you can print it all out. But if you don't know what you want to write yet, it doesn't give you any ideas or anything. I suggest buying books to help you learn to write instead, and then just using plain old microsoft word!"
3,a little stressful,I think I would have been very pleased with this product except for a problem that developed on my computer after I installed the software. I have windows xp and after I installed the software a serious error occured on my computer. I had never had a problem with my computer before I installed it.
5,Great for the price!,Great product! It helps you sort out your story thoughts/ideas and then provide the basic outline for the manuscript. This software also helps ensure you include those essential components necessary to create a decent novel.
1,beyond poor,"This software is super-dysfunctional. The instructions are terrible, the interfacing is terrible and the plans for creating a manuscript in any of the genres are terrible. I bought it three years ago as a gift and then found out the recipient didn't want it. I've tried off and on to get some value out of it myself: forget it; this item is a fraud. I would go so far as to say I suspect the sources of some positive reviews."
3,Good but confusing,Has some GREAT information contained in it. The concept presented is too encumbersome for me. Well worth the price for the information I gained though.
4,Author input,This program is full of ideas for the novice writer. Continuity weakened as the story progressed. Any aspiring author can learn from this approach to the development of a story. TAA
2,Not All It's Hyped Up to Be,"I recently purchased The Writer's Dreamkit two weeks ago to be exact. I was so excited after reading all the reviews. I decided it only cost a couple of dollars let me try it. I'm still trying to figure out this product.I really don't see it as being helpful. I can definitely do without it. I just decided to try it and see for myself. I really wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I think it's really a lot of hype.Instead of it being a creative tool, it more turned out to be a science project without instructions."
2,You Can't Hear A Book,"The big problem with this book is that you can't hear the music he describes, so it comes off a little like the old Chris Farley Show segment from Saturday Night Live. ""Do you remember when Mick Jagger sang with Tina Turner? That was awesome!""There are some fun and interesting anecdotes, but not nearly enough of them. Too much of the book is just a listing of singers and songs, dates and concerts.He spends an unusual amount of time savaging a former drummer, Dallas Taylor, who sued him for back royalties and won an out-of-court settlement. It didn't really fit with the rest of the book, and was rather jarring.The topic was interesting, but would have been much better suited to television or radio- a medium where you could actually hear what he's talking about."
3,Can big stars really change the world?,"David Crosby and co-writer David Bender want us to believe that commitment to just causes is worth the effort; it may not change things immediately, but there may be a knock on or ripple effect. ""We can all change the world in ways we never realize,"" Pete Seeger once wrote and these authors echo that belief. The writing is uneven, however, and sometimes in downright bad taste. The Vietnam War was not simply a ""f***ing meatgrinder"", it was an act of horror during which some 80 million tonnes of bombs were dropped on a peasant nation. Crosby decries political agendas but if we perpetuate a system that is rotten to the core, good intentions will not be enough. In part this book is the authors' efforts to pat their friends, who happen to be big stars, on the back. Having said this, I am glad the book was published and I hope it inspires people to get involved and change the world."
4,Recaptures 70's..80's major fundraising concert circuit..,"Gives statistics on attendance--some over 100,000, Peace/Anti-Nuc rallies & Bill Graham presents...Dylan & other Popicons donated their time..& Crosby's recent donation made cover of Rolling Stone. END"
5,People Working Together Can Accomplish Great Things..,"It is a voice inside the heart that never stops singing....and there will be times when you must stand up for injustice, your environment and others that are being mistreated. ""You Must Stand and be Counted""Thank You David Crosby for sharing your vision - We can all learn a great deal from this wonderful documentary.Jeff & Kathy Smith - Back Porch Benefit Foundation -"
1,Stand and Be Counted,"Seems to be a self-promotion for David Crosby -- I bet he didn't write one word of the book -- kinda like his overall input in Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young. Can I return this?"
1,....These Suck..!,"....Instead Of Waterboarding..Tie The Enemy To A Chair & Force Them To Watch This Drek..!..They Will Confess To Anything..!..As A Stoogeophile Who Started Collecting The Columbia Shorts In 2007, We All Have The 190 Shorts Now..(Thanks Sony..!)..The Intros & Exits On These Toons Are Out Of Focus..(NOT RHINOS FAULT)..And That Intro Music Every 5 Minutes.Da Dink Da Dink..ARRRGGGG..Where Are The Beatles Toons..?..Time-Warner..Where Are The Original MGM Ted Healy & His Stooges Shorts..In Two Strip Technicolor..?.."
1,Don't buy it!,"I bought this Kaspersky at Fry's 2 days ago & it made my computer slow at start, EXTRMELY SLOW when I opened MSN messenger and AOL browser at the same time. I have a pretty good computer, 3Ghz processor speed, 1016 MB, 211 GB free hard space with DSL connection speed at 1.5Mbps. I had Norton Internet Security 2005 before, and it never caused my computer to drag like it is now... I'm so disappointed with this product, it slowed down my computer to a point that I had to unplug it, in order to turn off the computer! Emailed Kaspersky tech, they blamed it on remnants of previous Norton antivirus! I did remove ALL of Norton, but computer is still slow with this Kaspersky installed. After Uninstalling this crappy software, computer performed like it used to, super fast and to those of u who saw good reviews on this prodct, don't believe in those people! This product is a bad choice!! A waste of money too!"
1,Terrible Software-Causes more problems than it solves,"Based on the rave reviews I saw on Amazon below I bought and installed Kaspersky AV Persona 5.0.1)On the plus side, it found several Trojan horse programs and deleted them.2)On the huge negative side I can no longer run Internet Explorer (blank window opens and then shuts), nor can I use Windows Media player, same thing happens.3)Another big negative -No support! I emailed support telling them of my problems but received no reply.If I can uninstall this thing, I will go back to Norton or McAffe."
1,impossible to uninstall this pest,"I recently made the big mistake of downloading the Kaspersky Internet Security 6.0 program on a 30 day trial basis. The program immediately slowed my computer and interfered with downloads to the extent that quicktime players,for example, would not install properly. Like M.Morris of Israel I tried to remove the program via the the control panel and couldn't. It is also impossible to turn the program off. As I have a new computor I will reformat the hard drive and nuke this pest program out of existence. Be warned."
5,An Encyclopedic Knowledge of Tarot,"The Sacred Tarot is one of the most well-worn books in my library. Thirty years after my first reading of this tome I continue to discover new insights that I may have previously oerlooked. This sixth volume in the Brotherhood of Light series is a literal `Encyclopedia' of tarot knowledge, touching upon the relationship of the major arcanum with Egyptian Initiation, Astrology, Cabbalism, Masonry, Bible study and Magic. This is always at the top of my list for recommended reading in tarot courses I have taught."
3,A different tradition...,"I bought this book, and the associated tarot cards, because I have owned the book ""How to Read Tarot Cards"" by Doris Chase Doane and King Keys for decades. My old book shows the Brotherhood of Light Egyptian Tarot cards; they have always fascinated me.But I also own other tarot decks and books, primarily from the Arthur Waite tradition and similar schools of thought.While there are overlaps in meaning, these two traditions are quite different. I can't reconcile them in my mind at all.Others: Swords = Air, Pentacles = EarthThese: Swords = Earth, Coins (Pentacles) = AirOthers: The Fool starts the cycle as 0 and AlephThese: The Fool is 22, and the Magus starts the cycle as 1 and AlephSo pick the one that corresponds to your understanding. But mix them carefully, if at all. I have to stick with the Waite tradition myself."
5,Want to win?,"I was just a ""pretty good"" player. I could hold my own but I wanted to win more often.I play the game for money. This read will make you more money if you play the game.My wife wanted to learn to play backgammon and challenge me but she was not having any fun because I always won. So I remembered I had read this book back in the 70'sso I was glad I found it at Amazon.Well... never underestimate the power of a woman, a backgammon board, a doubling cube and a great book to teach her the moves."
2,Lackluster,"I find this selection to be rather lackluster, not up to the standard set by other CDs in the series. I will probably put this one in the car to see if it comes over any better as background music when driving."
1,Misinformed,I ordered a microphone stand and it didn't come with the attachment to put your microphone in it.
5,Great start for the next Beethoven!,"My 18 month old absolutely adores this piano! This piano is very well-made, very sturdy, does not topple over, stood up to my son's abuse (he is at the age that he thinks everything is a drum!). It compliments our living room deco, even though our living room is white. The little bench is an asset, it makes him want to sit down and play the piano longer. BEST THING ABOUT THIS PIANO - BATTERY FREE! So though it's pricey to buy, you save on those expensive batteries replacement. It has very soothing (yeah, even with my son banging away), subtle keys, unlike some of those very annoying toys these days. It's one of his dad's favorite toy too!"
5,Beautiful and love sound,It's a well shaped small piano with a particular sound (little great acoustic reverb ). Really great instrument for kids and adults.
5,My 15 month old son loves it!,He got it for Christmas and plays with it everyday! Reminds me of the one I played with as a kid. :)
4,Great for toddlers,"This piano is so cute! Our two and a half year old loves it.It's kind of small, standing at 19 inches tall with the bench standing at 8 inches. I felt like it would be bigger judging by the picture, but no complaints otherwise. My two year old is on the small side, so she will be playing with this for a while. To those complaining that this doesn't sound like a real piano, Schoenhut makes ""real"" mini-pianos for $1000+ dollars, as do several other companies. For us, this is just right for a two year old to bang around on."
3,Arrived broken,"I bought this item for my grandson's birthday. It arrived with no instruction manual, 3 broken keys. This item is being returned and reordered. I hope it arrives undamaged and intact this time."
4,Androgynous!,"For couples who can finally share a fresh and clean scent, this is for you! I hate it when both of you have to wear perfume and your scents just CLASH!This is it for me! It's ageless and classic. Love it to bits."
3,It's okay,Wasn't what I expected... should have read listing more carefully.Was hoping for the full episode... but the sneak peak is at least funny.
3,"A visionary, if edgy, brainchild","Imagine the serious talent, vision, creativity and depth of perception that it takes to convert a sad, angry thing like spousal arguments into an engaging comic form. What these 2 artists accomplished built a distinctive niche in a hotly competitive time, and redefined our collective concept of comedy. They deftly walk the tightrope between building of tension and its release, between grounding their routines in reality to give them credibility vs. taking off from there to keep their act and their audience more comfortably in the realm of the surreal. This CD is unusually generous in its quantity of material, and I got a good few belly laughs from it, though their frequency was notably less than when I first heard similar material in its original time."
5,Ravishing form on Mozart sonatas,"I'd like to be as good at ANYTHING as Mitsuko Uchida is in these works; strong conception of the music, fine technique, unbelievable bending of the piano's sound to the purposes of the music. Buy and listen with jaw dropped."
2,Dissappointing....,"I haven't been a big fan of HIM but my girlfriend is, so I have come to appreciate their gothic romanticisms and eirie elements to which they protrude. However, all that is gone on this new release. There is more of a contrived feeling on this album, forced gothic terms put together without any real meaning. The sound is more rock than goth rock and that's not a good thing. It was hard for me to really differentiate between all the songs, since they all sound the same. Perhaps, they're failure was in trying to have a more commercial album, instead of keeping it honest and true to their sound. Also, their new video sucks too. Here's hoping they bring back Bam to direct."
2,Their weakest effort...,"This lp has two fantastic songs on it. ""...Wings Of A Butterfly"" and ""In The Nightside of Eden"" are great songs and Ville performs them well enough, though you can hear very clearly that his voice is not what it used to be. Then there is ""Play Dead"" and ""The Face of God"" which are good songs. And lastly, ""Dark Light"", which is ok. The rest are simply awful. Ville is clearly cracking at this point, and it shows in the mostly poor song writing and in the subsequent truely terrible live shows in support of the lp. I fear he is suffering horribly within his fame and it is slowly destroying him and his music. A sad lp overall."
1,"Two Words, Pathetic and Dull","Dark Light by H.I.M., whoever ""he"" may be, is one of the most cliched driven, dung infested works of music ever produced by studios geared towards the ""new masses"", mainly irreverent teenage waste-toids who live in the suburbs and spend their rich parents money at malls. I listened to it expecting some liturgy of satan but all I heard was cat screeching metal infused love ballads for mall geeks who wear purple eye makeup. This stuff is horrible, I can't understand why a mature lover of Tchaikovsky, like myself, would indulge in this mindless rubbish, it really isnt enticing or even thought provoking either."
3,"Good, but not as good as it should have been","This CD is far better than most CDs from any other band, but from HIM, it's a letdown. It's not nearly as good, or as imaginative, as any of their other CDs. It's far too popish, and all the songs sound the same. Unfortunately, though the mainstream likes the CD, it's not the same HIM the long-term fans knew and loved."
4,It Was Decent,"This Album Was Ok I Guess. I Wasnt Great, It Wasnt Bad, It Just Was...Average. There Was A Couple Of Songs I Liked. I Hated The Wings Of A Butterfly Song Though. Vampire Heart, Behind The Crimson Door, And Killing Loneliness Were The Only Stand Out Tracks On Here, But That's My Opinion."
3,"This is the ""cheaper"" version of the Lmt. Ed. Dark Light Cd","This album is a really, really good one. I love the older ones but this one is still great. It feels like when these great bands get signed to a more major record label their sounds seems to change. It's really good like I said but it feels like they're drawing a ""musical blank"" as I like to call it. They seemed to do this during there third cd ""Deep Shadows and Brilliant Highlights"". But speaking of albums and releases I read one review that said ""...And Love Said No"" came out before ""Love Metal"" which is wrong. It's the opposite. Just thought I'd clear that up for you guys that didn't know that. But anyways, any HIM album is gonna be a great one, and this one rocks. I got lucky though, I got the rare one that they only made 20,000 copies of! Just thought I'd through that in."
5,"Amazing Band, Amazing album","This c.d is a must for all HIM fans, or anyone who has heard of the band. This cd and band can not be classified as anything other than ""Scandinavian Love Metal"". This band has a mixture of pure rock attitude with a splash of melodic lyrics. The first time I heard this CD I couldn't get enough of it. It's is absolutly amazing. I can not say that this is the greatest HIM album, but it up there with my favourite cd's of all time. Each song has it's own special meaning and sound. This is not just another main stream band. Once you hear them you will be hooked. I can not pick a favourite song on this cd, THAT'S how good it is. This CD will keep you coming back for more, and looking more into this amazing Finnish band. I believe this is a great representation of what this band is trying to acomplish."
4,"I ADMIT, I LIKE IT","Yes, this H.I.M. release is a very ""produced"" album that the record company is heavily promoting. Yes, they are pretty much mainstream in Europe now ... but so what? I like it. I like it because it's really good, solid, & catchy music. Ville Valo gives great vocals and the band is tight. Nice to have an album where all the songs are good, not just a couple. I am really glad I bought this album."
2,LUKEWARM - it's boring,"i do not feel a connection to this album. i love all of their other albums. this one appears to have been made solely for the purpose of appealling to an american audience. so far, i think it is bland. i will give it another listen to see what happens...i read most of the reviews here. some reek of what i like to call 'the emperor's new clothes' syndrome. they would give it a good review no matter what..."
3,HIM has changed,"to start this out i bet half of you have never heard of this damn band before CKy, JAckass, or Viva La Bam. this is my least favorite HIM album mainly because they went mainstream on it. HIM's older material was better written and darker. Also one of the reviewers of this album said HIM never stood for His Infernal Majesty.....WRONG!!!!! HIM was originally called His Infernal Majesty....they chose it as a joke and when they released Greatest Love Songs Vol. 666 they changed it to HIM. And do half of you know that the guitarist is in another band called Daniel Lioneye with Ville Valo playing drums? probabally not....if you want to hear them just watch Viva La Bam....they play the theme song. Anyway this album just doesnt cut it for me....but HIM's new material in September with a U.S. release date of September 18th is their darkest and heaviest yet....cheers."
3,I don't regret buying it,"I don't regret buying this c.d., but there are only a few songs on it that really catch my ear. Of course Wings of a Butterfly is one of them."
1,crap music,"Suppose to be rock/metal, sorry attempt at either. Wannabe's hopefully soon will be has beens. Only sorry can't give negative stars. Only gave one cause you have to. Ugh. My ears/brain hurt from hearing them."
5,Wow...,"Ok, when I bought this CD, I started to have second thoughts. The only song on here that I liked was ""Rip Out The Wings Of A Butterfly"", because I had been listening to it for a few weeks on MTV2. So, I downloaded it onto my MP3 player, and right when the first song started, I thought ""This is so cool"". I listened to the whole thing, and now, its one of my favorite CD's. If you like rock thats not mainstream crap, get this. You wont be dissappointed."
3,Middling,"Great cover art. Love the ""blockbuster"" look. Music is subpar for the band. Not enough hooks like past releases. Trying too hard to become all things to all people. Betraying the goth ethos. Can't have it both ways. Should listen to more Sisters Of Mercy before they record their next album. Still, much better than most ""popular"" rock/metal-lite. Start with their earlier material first though."
3,H.I.M. - Dark Light,"I remember when Ville Valo's voice would echo in my dreams and the lyrics would hypnotize me for weeks, but suddenly it is as though he stopped writing good music the moment he was no longer free. Poor Valo is now committed to some random. Maybe he needs not have a long line of girls following him anymore, so the only way to get them off his back is to stop giving them what they want- his talent.This album is not terrible, it just lacks enthusiasm. If you want to hear some good H.I.M. music, invest in ""Razorblade Romance"" or just about any other album but this one.Here is a band that is also from Finland & is MUCH, MUCH better than H.I.M. - To/Die/For...they released a new album this year as well, & let me tell you, it was not disappointing at all!"
1,gothic rock is stupid,"hi, im goerge. i think goth rock is so stupid and lame. him is in 1st of my hate list. oh yah and who ever likes emo is a real looser in denile. HIM is so stupid. Bam margera is blowing his mind with this crap. i hate the stupid heart, triangle,and circle hartagram. buy a piece of crap instead of this."
1,Not a Christian Band,"I have had a few folks recommend this band to me supposedly because it is a ""Christian"" band- um, NO. First of all, the pentegram-heart thing? Contrary to what somebody tried to tell me, it's not the Star of David. Seriously. Look at it. And H.I.M., referring to ""Him"" as in God? No, it stands for ""His Infernal Majesty"" and if you can't figure out WHO that is, well, it ain't Jesus. All of this, plus the fact that their song's subject matter is heavily doused with suicide and how great dying would be, plus all those 666 songs- and yeah, let me repeat, H.I.M. is NOT A CHRISTIAN BAND. So, if you are a Christian, go for goodies like Day of Fire, Skillet, and Project 86. If you aren't Christain, by all means have a good time with H.I.M. Just don't recommend it to your Christian friends under the guise that they are a wholesome, God-focused band. That, and give some of the Christain hard-core bands a try...great music with an actual purpose."
1,WHAT THE F*CK?!,this aint metal retards! u can click no and call me names all u him fans its not gonna change the fact the HIM SUCKS!
2,Confused,"I Must say I really enjoy razorblade romance, deep shadows and love emtal, but as much as i try i just can't get into this album. It has some good parts, but like previous reviews i agree it sounds a bit the same. Another confusing aspect is that the keyboards now are thrown into the foreground and take too much away from the guitar. His vocals sound way too clean, there's not enough of his low deep voice or the trembling vocals we are used to. This is an extremely watered down, bland, overproduced version of a band i love. It's not going to defer me from enjoying their previous efforts, but I am confused with this release."
3,Heard Better HIM Songs,"This album just doesn't cut it for me. The lyrics/vocals are weak compared to previous HIM releases. This is still a decent album, but not what you'd expect from finland's premier rock group."
2,It's plain and boring,"After listening to this album, I have to say that I'm very disappointed, this album is weak; I hope it ends up growing on me, but at the moment I simply don't get it; the best song to me so far is Face of God. Anyway, maybe if you are a big HIM fan, you should give it a try."
1,Wait a minute...THIS IS GOTH?!?!,"Real goth metal: Christian Death, Type O Negative, My Dying Bride, Candlemass, and Paradise Lost.H.I.M.: MTV goth metal wannabes that are the Finnish version of Evanescence."
1,This isn't H.I.M.,"A complete disappointment. Nowhere near his previous efforts. The voice is scratchy, the music tinny, and the worst thing he's ever done! Not one good song on the entire album. Sadly to say I own it, played it once, and now it'll lay for the rest of it's life. He needs to get back to his Gothic roots and stay away from experimental crap like this."
1,Eggplant & OzzyApu are right,"H.I.M. DOES suck ass. Just read OA and Eggplant's reviews, they speak the truth.Boycott this turd, buy any Dream Theater album instead; the guitarist from HIM can't play a SINGLE lick from any of John Petrucci's solos. This band is about as goth as dogs taking a piss."
1,Awful,"First of all i dont know why Mr. M. Hart ""sci-fi fan"" would say that HIM was insipired by dimmu borgir because for one dimmu is black metal not gothic metal and second he got it wrong they arent from sweden but are from norway. And second i dont understand why people like HIM so much. I think there are much better bands to listen to then them. So yeah dont buy this album its a waste of your money."
2,*sigh*,"I really REALLY liked this band. It's just sad that this album sounds nothing like the other ones. This no longer classifies as ""Love Metal"". I would call it ""Pop"". Every song sounds the same. There is no more crunch, hard lyrics, or amazing music. Don't get me wrong, there are some good songs on this album. But the song that the album was named after sounds like Tinkerbell went to Fairyland. Every song just blends into the next one. All of their other albums I gave 5 stars too, this one just didn't make it."
2,HIM USED To Be So Good!,"OK so after following this band for over 6 years they finally come out with an album released in the US. What a disapointment.This album is meh. nothing too special. This is by far the worst album they have released and should not reflect on them as a band. On the same note the song ""dark light"" is the WORST song ive ever heard by HIM. ALL other albums are MUCH better. If you are new to HIM this may appeal to you but PLEASE look at their other albums especially GREATEST LOVE SONGS VOL 666 and RAZORBLADE ROMANCE."
5,Consume! Buy Now! :-),"Whether you are a long time fan of HIM or you slept on HIM for a while and just realized HIM exists, you should definitely buy this album!I buy lots of CDs, and this is the first CD in a while that didn't leave me skipping tracks! I have nothing negative to say about this album, because in my opinion there are no weak points.Musically this album is gorgeous and I was quite impressed.Compared to other HIM albums the vocals do seem a little... different. Clearer?? Smoother?? Whatever the deal is it's awesome.My favorite tracks are: ""Vampire Heart"", ""Dark Light"", ""Behind the Crimson Door"", and ""Play Dead"".Why are you still reading this? Go! Buy! It's worth every penny! =)"
2,Could have been better,This Box set would be great Marley material but the sound quality is absolutly horrible. I can't even describe how bad it can get at times. You have to be a huge fan to listen to this. Bob was oviously alot younger when he did this because his voice isnt as deep as it usually is. I would save your money and buy some of the original albums because that's where Marley's true greatness is shown.
4,Are you a long range boater - Read this book!,This book is a facinating assembly of condensed stories about disasters at sea - yacht disasters. If you think that you are immune when at sea this book will wake you up. My family and I are considering some long range cruising and this book has impacted our thinking. You must be well prepared and vigilant in your efforts to plan well and this book really puts many things into perspective. A great read for boaters!
1,A Typical JDE Low Quality Stuff,"In short, this book is a condensed copy of exsiting JDE technical manuals (B733.1), with which you can not do your job.To beginners, you are sure to be confused by its various advanced topics.To intermedium users, you are going to be frustrated because it does not tell you enough to do the job.To advanced users, advanced topics are mentioned but not covered.WORSR OF ALL, it is full of bugs just like JDE OneWorld software. But no ESU available.JDE publisher, PLEASE do a better job !"
4,"Good, but not quite their best...","This CD is really good and almost worthy of five stars, but comparisons to the Ramones will come quickly. It's this lack of originality that is the downfall. Don't take the wrong way though. This CD is awesome. Any fan of pop/punk will love it. The songs are super catchy and many times go beyond most Ramones songs. Go buy it."
3,Good desk reference book,"This dictionary arrived within the estimated time and in the condition expected. It is a good dictionary, just not my favorite. The definitions are too abstract on the words I looked up to suit me. I would recommend this seller. I prefer Funk and Wagnall's dictionary to this one."
4,-Another Great Dictionary-,"I have a couple of different versions of this and enjoy looking through them both. I ordered this one from a seller on Amazon and was completely burned. The thing was in extremely poor-shape and had a very musky odor about it. I ended up throwing it in the dumpster rather than returning it and running the risk of having it misrepresented and sold to some other unsuspecting soul, MAYBE YOU. Anyway, if you can get your hands on a decent copy, I highly recommend this version."
5,A real live dictionary.,"Sometime its nice to still use a dictionary thats made of actual pages of paper and not electronics. This dictionary suits that very well, illustrated too."
2,New edition betrays quality of previous edition,"This dictionary is a failure of book design. The interior columns are crowded into the gutter, violating basic book design aesthetics. What happened?The previous edition from the 1970s was an exemplary example of quality bookmaking: clean and easy to read.The 1993 edition is a design disaster. Seek out a better-made book."
5,The best general-purpose dictionary,"Although it is perennially outsold by the Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary - whose red cover will be familiar to Reference shelf browsers, thanks to M-W's large advertising and distribution budget - the American Heritage is far and away the superior product: (in descending order of importance) unmatched clarity of definitions, cleanliness of layout (better than even the AH Unabridged, in this respect), and currency of coverage. This dictionary will meet your lexicographical needs in fine style 99.9% of the time. For that 1-in-1000 occasion, you'll have to go the library and suffer through the Oxford English Dictionary's fusty definition style."
5,Simply the Best,"I purchased this book as a gift for a high school graduate going off to college. I have been teaching college English for thirty-three years, and have been requiring my English Composition students to buy it since the first edition came out. The definitions and resources in this book are startlingly clear; the ""Usage Panel"" notes of previous editions contain wonderful discussions of the ""majority"" opinions of a panel of experts on complex usage questions that baffle most of us every day. The American Heritage Dictionary is the most reliable definer of American English as it is used today, and I treasure its reliablity and accuracy. No home should be without it. I haven't looked at the CD Rom included in this edition, but it is probably as superb as the book itself for the computer generation leading us into the future. I prefer pages and wanderings. If you don't own this book, you are depriving yourself of an adventure in discovery. Don't go one more day without it."
4,Great space saver,"This book is exactly what A.com describes in its review. Margins are a bit of a problem, but you get an almost unabridged dictionary in one tenth the space. I am still searching for a fine print version at one half the size of this one."
2,Nice if you want hard copy,"Nice book. Great book even but don't buy it for the CD. There are plenty of other electronic dictionaries and thesaurii that provide a far easier interface. The opening box comes up in the center of the screen. No apparent methods to have it defaulted for size or placement. The opening screen always defaults to ""A"" and not your last word. Hence, you lose your ability to start where you left off on writing projects. If you want to follow a train on a similar word in a defintion or thesaurus, you need to type it in. No double click to speed up search. Basically, the CD is not much more useful than the printed version."
3,Use Common Sense First,The pictures are great and the ideas are helpful - but use your own good sense first. I'm a first time mom and used it as a reference the first time I gave my baby a bath. It recommends the water be 85 degrees... Umm... NO!!! As my baby very vocally told me. (That's colder than body temperature for crying out loud!) The second bath I just did what I felt was right and my li'l guy was *so* much happier.
3,Good for what it is.,"This book provides the minimum amount of information needed, but it is very useful for those topics that are covered, such as changing, cleaning, etc. your baby.Lots of topics are missing that could have been included, but all in all this was a good buy.Get it used if you can."
4,Great reference book for new Moms,"I bought this book because I wanted a quick reference book on how to do certain things with the baby. Like when to start feeding the baby solid foods. Although I already have one other child, it had been 6 years, so I needed something to refer back to in case I forgot certain things. It is a great book for the first time Mom or for any Mom that just needs a quick refresher course. The only thing I didn't expect was that it was so small. But truthfully I am really not that disapointed because it fits well in a diaper bag."
5,a great guide for new parents,i really recommend this pocket guide for new parents. this book contains information that are easy to read and understand.it features a lot of images as illustrations too.
2,Not much fun,"A future battle of the sexes? Could have been fun. But this vision of the future isn't convincing enough to be entertaining, and the lifeless, flat characters are utterly unabsorbing. A short thriller that never develops its theme in an interesting way."
4,Two Faced,"This is a great book that you could see from two perspectives. If you are a male reading this book, you would see it differntly than how a female would see it. The females have a lot of power in this book, and it's kinda like a World War of the sexes. This is a very original book, or at least I have never read anything else like it."
4,Another gem!,"Michael Cordy delivers another high quality read.. on a topic that will become increasingly 'current' over the coming decades. As was the case with Miracle Strain, Cordy is very early out and displays considerable foresight in his predicted outcomes.A must read if you are into well researched fiction exploring the age old science vs faith dilemma."
4,"Gripping, and scarily feasible","I stumbled across this book in a local charity shop and thought I'd give it a read. I have to say that it was a great decision. Initially, I was slightly blinded by the descriptive science, but once I got involved in the plot I was hooked. This book makes you ask questions as to whether or not this could actually happen. Highly recommended."
2,Coulda' been a contender,"A work of fiction, which is based on science, must use science fact as far as it will go. When there is conflict between the science and the fiction, the fiction must bend, the science cannot. I was turned off by errors in the science in the first chapter, and after that it becomes harder to suspend disbelief. The premise is interesting, and the action is thrilling, although a little stretched out in some places. It's overall a fairly entertaining read, but it could have been a real winner with some advice from a neuroscientist, and a little more editorial help."
2,Crime Zero found to be shallow,"I found this book to be shallow, with poorly developed, non-believable characters, weak science, and a poorly justified plot.The thesis is interesting, but the writer just didn't have the chops to pull it off -- it fails the suspension of disbelief test.The science is poorly described; it's as if Cody had memorized some technical terms and sprinkled them around in the text.Compare with Neal Stephenson's recent book."
1,Beware,"This adapter doesn't work on the newer HP digital cameras so be sure to check the model number before you purchase. Also, the adaptor comes in a package that is impossible to open without ruining. Conveniently, Ritz Camera does not accept returns if the packaging isn't intact. Shipping was also steep at 6.99. I would not purchase from this vendor again."
5,Fantastic!!! Wonderful music beautifully played!,This cd has the finest version of the Canon in D by Pachelbel that I have ever heard and by now I own a few. It is worth owning just for that but it is all beautifully played and presented so I enjoy listening to the whole cd. I recommend this.
3,"OK, but not great","I think each of these performances is fine in and of itself, but I don't care for the coupling of these pieces (I know, I should have thought of that before I bought it, but I didn't!). In particular, the Leopold Mozart Symphony doesn't do it for me and detracts from the rest of the CD from my perspective. I'll probably look around for another recording of Nachtmusik and the Canon."
2,Feels silky but not energizing,"I purchased the 150 ml (5.2 oz) tube of cream hoping that it would relieve my tired legs. The directions say to ""Apply in the morning after showering or bathing. Massage gently from bottom of legs to top"" which I did.I have used almost the entire tube of cream and while I will say that it does make my skin feel softer, it does nothing for my tired legs. The cypress camphor gives a momentary feeling similar to tingling but that is all.Also, after using about half of the tube, it became very difficult to squeeze out the necessary cream.I like most of the L'Occitane products but this is one that I will pass up in the future."
4,A REALLY different Venom.,"I think that people ignore this particular Venom album because it lacks the dark atmosphere and blasphemous lyrics of their previous albums. Instead, the concepts are a little more varied than on earlier works. It does not measure up to their earlier work, but it is by no means a bad album. The main reason I'm giving this album four stars is because of the departure of Mantas, who to me, was the most important aspect of Venom. Without him, the music leaves something to be desired. Still, there are plenty of great tracks on here including ""Black Xmas"", ""Metal punk"", ""Under a spell"", ""Calm before the storm"", and ""Gypsy"". I would not recommend this album to those just starting to get into Venom, but it is still a great buy and a nice piece of straightforward metal."
3,Not Classic Venom,"This recording replaces Matas with two newer guitarists and had a new lyrical style, which is much less hard-hitting than the previous albums. It is a bit more thoughtful than the classic Venom, but much softer and less impressive on the whole. A less hardcore and more thrashy sound is here, and the songs are really fairly decent, but I think Cronos and crew should have stuck to genuine Black Metal."
5,Mrs. Restino's Country Kitchen,"My husband and I love this book. From the Clam Chowder to ""How to Freeze green beans"". This is a must have in any kitchen. Very informative."
1,OF NO HELP,"I purshased this book over the internet hoping it would be of value for an upcoming school report our teacher is making us do. Each of us had to pick a foreign country , I picked Scotland because that is my nationality. This book really gave me nothing I could use. It is not much about Scotland but is about what someone bored with life does. Maybe I'm too young to get it, but I cant fathom why this book was done, or even what it is about. I see the author has other ways of making some money. He should stick to them. As for me, I got an A on the report because I used the encyclopedia built into my computer. As part of this class project we also had to write a review on amazon. There isn't much to say besides if you need to find out alot about Scotland for a school report, find a better book!"
4,This was interesting and easy to read,This walking story included personal and historical impressions of Scotland. I couldn't stop reading once I started. There were 2 or three typos which should have been found by a better editor. I recommend it.
4,This book is like sushi,"The book took me a chapter to get used to it. Then I stopped being disoriented and really liked it. Since I come from a background which does not like raw things, I was reminded of the first time I was offered Japanese food. At first I said ""no"". Then I tried it to be a good sport. Then I came to crave it. I expected more facts about places in Scotland, but it didn't matter after a while because it is a book that makes you feel what it is like there. Strange in a good way. I want to know more now."
1,I'm No Saint:A Nasty Little Memoir of Love and Leaving,Who cares? This is a nasty little book that should have never been written. Perhaps Ms. Hayt's talents would be best applied to helping people avoid her mistakes...what does it mean to dedicate this trash to her parents who she constantly blames? Get a life..
5,Judge a Book by its Cover,"What first grabbed me about Elizabeth Hayt's I'm No Saint was the gorgeous cover followed by the shocking content of the first page. The sex and drug scenes that followed made for a great read but what most surprised me was her terrific writing style --eloquence mixed with wit. The book is actually more serious than it seems, filled with rich emotion and Hayt's piercing insights about romance, desire and heartbreak. I loved how Hayt revealed so much of herself and her crazy life without coming off as bitter or whiney. She is a role model for so many women who feel pressured to become who they aren't and then break from that mold. I savored every page and was only disappointed when I finished the book. I never wanted it to end."
4,Completely Unhinhibited -- It Will Keep Your Attention!,"Elizabeth Hayt is an excellent writer and embarrassingly honest. She dives head first into everything she does, often without concern for the consequence, which makes for an extremely interesting read. You may find yourself cringing in parts, but even if you can't identify with her choices, you can't help but root for her in the end."
2,Bourgeois Scratching,"A ""blog"" by a person of privilege who believes that spreading her legs or her lips is the ticket to catapulting her spirit beyond the boredom of a bourgeois ""life."" Connection or commitment (to family, friends, husband and child or just about anything)is constantly trumped, in Hayt's... err ...mind by scratching her itch. Truly a remarkable admission of breaking ""taboos"" by someone who values confessional tales of grabbing, stroking, pulling, licking or humping as perhaps the most heroic set of actions available to the upwardly mobile with education,money and opportunity. Oh, there are drugs and deadlines, too."
3,Penthouse Forum Writing,"Reads like Penthouse Forums strung together, with a rather unintresting life in between. Unless you don't know anyone who does drugs, sleeps around or has an eating disorder. If you do it's old hat with more than a hint of the toxic quality people in that lifestyle spread around. I found myself happy for her ex- husband at the end of the book, rather than having sympathy for her."
3,"frothy, empty","If there ever were an advertisement for sane, monogamous living, this book is it. The author details her sexual and other exploits in the Big City with some witty prose, but there is no real content--no real concern about others, or about causes, or about anything except herself. If she were in her 20s, maybe, just maybe this would be excusable--but by the time she writes the book she is well into her 40s and the deepest conclusion she can come up with is that it is okay to be alone."
5,real life,"The authors opens up to all of her"" real life ""journey with a brutally honest detailed depiction . You will definitely relate to your own life's story. Everyone (young/old, male/ female,single/married etc) will love this book. You just can't put it down! It took a great deal of courage to let the world into her mind and body surrounded by all of the influences of our society. From suburbia to the big city you will thoroughly enjoy the adventure filled with sex,drugs, and everything else you could possibly imagine. Can't wait to read her next book."
4,Fascinating!,"I'M NO SAINT by Elizabeth HaytOctober 14, 2005Amazon rating 4/5""In her memoir, I'm No Saint, Elizabeth Hayt writes about her somewhat crazy and dysfunctional existence, going from a family with parents who had problems of their own, to a husband she did not find sexually appealing, and finally to the many lovers who pass through her life. Drug problems, sexual addictions, low self-esteem - it's all in here. The people she met are as interesting as the life she led."" Complete review at BookLoons dot com - M Lofton.I don't usually read memoirs, but when I do I tend to enjoy them a lot. This one was one of the more raunchier ones."
1,"Disappointed, pathetic little woman.....","Is so angry that she spread her legs for so many men and now she wants to get even. Funny, she only demonstrated she was a hooker without getting paid. No one held a gun to her head. She wasn't/isn't that attractive either. She is a mother and sets a shining example for her children on how not to lead life. Now she is angry that the men who stchupped her, after her agressive advances to wrap her legs behind her ears, don't care or she is but a fleeting memory. What does she expect? She was wearing a hookers uniform, therefore she must be a hooker. How can you care about someone who is so completely self-absorbed and notideably stupid? Book is marginal. Read Erica Jong instead."
4,Not What I Expected...,"When this mouse arrived in the mail, I was hoping for great detail and to be blown away. The truth is that there was detail, but not enough to make me truly satisfied. For schleich collectors out there, this is a cute but not detailed addition to your collection."
4,"Tiny and overpriced, but one of a kind","You won't find another white mouse like this one no matter how hard you look. My little boy loves mice and small animals so I got him this one, it's well made and cute, but I still would not pay as much if I had a comparative alternative.Bottom line is: it's Schleich, you should know what to expect by now, both in terms of quality and price."
5,The greatest super heroes - who never were.,"You will believe that these heroes have existed in the pages of comics for over half a century, that they were the creations of Jack Kirby, that you're looking at actual comic book covers during the loading screens.The personalities are perfect. The heroes are interesting, likable, and unique. The game-play is pure time-slipping joy. It's campy, well polished, and delivered better than any other super hero based game ever made.DC and Marvel... TAKE NOTE!Here's hoping we see more of Freedom Force. The first game was great (Be sure and grab the 1.3 patch if you decide to pick up the original game, it addresses XP SP2 issues!), But this sequel is as close to perfection as any game has ever come, in terms of embodying a love of classic comic books, and super heroes.Excelsior!"
4,great but short,"Just finished FFVTR-Pros- Fun to revisit, enjoyable and worth the $$, definately worth the $$.Cons: Shorter than I would have liked and issues with game balance. You can REALLY soup up a custom charactor and it throws the game balance.I created a straight 10's with acid burn area, melee, and direct with clone and mercy as well as gathering of friends and empaty and it steam rolled everything. Only cost 31K prestige. hmmmmm.Overall-it's enjoyable despite some REALLY annoying levels (Could Skyking ""Adjust his suit ANY more slowly????) would like to see the ability to adjust the powers that the built in charactors have(ie expand a range or up the damage on something), Game balance is off-but I liked kicking A**.Buy it, you'll like it and it WILL leave you wanting more. In part because of the length.Joe"
2,Great Except for Bugs (no patches available),"I just got this game for Christmas, and loved it. That is, until the sound failed. Oddly enough the game somehow resets the sound and speaker settings on my computer. I love the game though, and if it weren't for the sound problem (for which there is no patch [and there is no patch available of any kind at this point]) I would rate the whole thing five stars."
2,"Good game but way, way too short","If you liked or loved the original Freedom Force but thought it was too short, you'll both love and loath Freedom Force v. the Third Reich.Essentially, FFVTTR is the same great game as FF but it's hard to justify the $30 price tag for what is essentially a an add on mod. I played FFVTTR four times while playing the original FF in parallel. Then near the end, characters are taken away making it hard to max those characters out.Wait for it to hit the bargain bin, $10-$12 is an okay price to pay for this very, very short game. I was stunned to come here and find someone thought there was enough of a game to make an official strategy guide.I really wish game reviewers in magazine would start doing their job and point these things out. Especially magazines that one of the lead designers work for.But still not as bad as the Steam debacle."
4,Freedom Force,A must buy for people that like super hero type rpgs. Even though this game is great it's not as good as the first Freedom Force even the packaging of the first Freedom Force is better. In the first one you got a glossy manual and a case for the game discs but for this one you get a plain paper manual and paper cases for the game discs. The cut scenes in the first Freedom Force to me merged well to help you understand the story and characters but in this one it sometimes feels disjointed. Nevertheless it's a really good game and decent sequel.
4,Classic goodie,"I started the first game back in high school and didnt know anything about part two until I looked for the first one. I just remembered the game and wanted to play it once again but after learning about the second one I figured I would play that one instead. I work a lot so I dont get to play as much as I would like to but I got threw the first part of the game and it plays like the first. It is as fun as I remember it! If you are a fan of the genre of old school comics with cheesy lingo and silver aged dialog, you will appreciate the story."
4,"Good, but too short","This was an excellent game in terms of fun and quality. The graphics are excellent and the story is well suited to the story at the same time. However, it was far too short, and lacks some replayability."
3,Whale of a calculator,"This calculator is absolutely huge! Bought it for my dad to replace an ancient one he loved that broke. This calculator was very confusing for him, and it's now packed away in its box. He had his old one repaired! The Canon MP11DX is very good quality, performed as advertised, and the packaging and shipper were excellent. It just was too big and too complicated for my father to use confidently."
5,Canon calulator,The Canon caluclator replaced my old one which wore out due to extensive use. The price was good and the quick delivery was great. Thanks.
2,Calculator does not work in printing mode,"I am very disappointed with this product. The calculator works fine in the ""on"" mode but once you move the dial to the printing mode an ""E"" (overflow error) displays on the screen and the calculator stops functioning. Also the ribbon inside the calculator appeared to be used. Contacted the 800 number that came with the instructions and was told that it would be best to return item to the seller because it would take up to two weeks for Canon to begin processing the item once they receive it...WOW. On other sites people complained about the short life span of this calculator therefore I'm returning for a refund. In addition, the calculator was a bit larger than expected. This is a huge disappointment."
3,"Nice Cufflinks, Packaging needs work","The cuff links themselves are really nice looking. My only complaint is that they don't come in a ""real"" cuff link jewelry box that has a strong hinge and some way of holding each link in place. Instead they are bulked into a felt pouch, and then placed inside a small cardboard box with a piece of padding on the bottom. Since there's no way for the lid to stay on the box, the cufflinks can easily fall out; and because they are both stored in the same pouch, they can rub against each other and scratch. I was giving these to someone as a ""nice gift,"" but they loose some of their perceived value if they are shoved inside of a cheap box like the jewelry you see on display on tables at department stores.Overall, I think they're nice cufflinks... but for the price I wish they would at least provide a better box."
4,A realistic view of an adolescent,The book is about some kids that go out of control. A dork goes to the limit to get the hottest girl in high school. The events turn and he is thrown away from the only chance that he has of rising in popularity when he gets too greedy.This book would be good for people 13-106 (if you can still read by the time you are 106). The book goes in a fast and exciting pace. The plot is well developed and it comes to a tragic ending.
1,A terrible Remake!,"Jake, Reinvented was such a disappointment! For any Gatsby lovers, don't read this book! Maybe I'm biased, but I love Gatsby and this book was just a poorly done carbon copy of the classic. My school librarian told me this was a supposedly a modern Gatsby, but I don't think she knew that it's basically a rip-off of the original."
4,"Great Adaptation of ""The Great Gatsby""","This book is a wonderful adaptation of ""The Great Gatsby"", taking place in a high school setting rather than the 1920s. Although Gatsby is an American classic, people often miss the subtle social commentary and seem to not truly understand the significance of all that happens. ""Jake, Reinvented"" on the other hand is extremely readable, and the ramifications of characters' actions are immediately understood and it leaves you truly wanting to know what happens next. This is a good book for all ages, but particularly young adults- the only reason that I can't give it 5 stars is that is not on par with its inspiration."
4,I can use this with my IEP'd students that struggle with reading!,"I grabbed this from a fellow teacher's bookshelf and just dove in. I had no idea this was a parallel to ""The Great Gatsby,"" but it didn't take long (especially when the characters attend F.Scott Fitzgerald High). However, I set it down andwent to our high school's football game on Fri night, but couldn't wait to get home and check in with Jake, Ricky, Jen, and Didi. The story was growing on me!Upon reflection, I'm going to suggest this as an alternative read of ""Gatsby"" for high school students who have decoding/comprehension issues. The story is fun to read, and the themes that ""Gatsby"" teaches are evident in this adaptation. I'm so glad I noticed it."
2,Kinda cute,These glasses are very small. The ice bowls are so little that we would need to crush the ice cubes to get them into the bowl. The glasses might hold one shot of vodka. But I kinda agree with another review that they would be perfect for shrimp cocktails. So maybe I'll get more sets so I can use them for dinner parties and serve shrimp cocktails as an appetizer.
2,Too many false alarms,When it works it's great but it seems that when the temperature approaches or is below freezing it starts generating very frequent false alarms to the point that we have to disable it making it useless.The vendor said it could be the rechargable batteries and sent us replacements but that hasn't helped. It does seem to happen more on cloudy days so it could be something to do with the solar cell not sufficiently charging the battery.
3,works sometimes,"This monitor should be louder, you can only hear it if you are close to the reciever. Sometimes it gives false alarms. Not the best."
3,Movie description is inaccurate,"The description makes the film seem as if it's about the dynamics of the party scene itself. While this topic is discussed in the film, it's more of an ancillary topic that goes to support their main focus of the film. The film itself is not so much about the party scene as it is about Asian-American identity, expressed through NYC's asian night life."
5,Even Hispanics can appreciate this film,"There are many similarities to the asian american experience to the Hispanic experience: Shame, feeling like you live in two worlds, and some infrequent difficulting relating to the ""outsider."" This film is a great teaching tool for racial reconciliation, and to get to know your culture of your asian american neighbors. I can't wait till Hsueh and Hahn's next film!!!!"
5,Insightful and intriguing,This is a very engaging documentary exploring the Asian American culture (specifially Korean American and Chinese American) through the lens of parties.
1,The book is useless unless your doing a tech interview,"The book has no in depth information on CICS, no mention of background processes. The index pages don't match the contents of the book (try julian date for example). The map examples are most simplistic, never found in real life. Nobody codes like these examples. In short, hated it!"
4,I't wasn't Keene's best.,"This was a pretty good book.It was all about how Nancy and the Hardys have to solve this case at a resort.Ned shows up in the middlish end.He sees Frank and Nancy hugging and thinks that hes lost his girlfriend.But Nancy talks to him and they still go out together.The case is eventually solved and Nancy and the Hardys go back to their regular lives then solve their next case,The Paris Connection."
4,HELLO! NO OFFENSICE MS. KEENE BUT WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?,THIS IS A GOOD BOOK BUT NOT MY FAVORITE. WHY DOES NED HAVE TO SHOW UP? NANCY AND FRANK ARE PERFECT FOR EACH OTHER. PLEASE MS. KEENE CAN'T YOU HAVE A SERIES (I AGREE WITH AN ABOVE PERSON) WHERE NANCY AND FRANK ARE TOGETHER?
3,The two new 1962 Missals,"I have bought both the Angelus Press (www.angeluspress.com) and Baronius Press (www.baroniuspress.com) 1962 Missals recently. It is odd that they both came out at the same time after decades without being able to get a hold of one.On the whole they are pretty similar, although some differences are apparent immediately - the Baronius Edition is bound in real leather, and is a standard Missal size, whilst the Angelus one has a cheap plastic like cover and is about 30% larger, which doesn't make it as easy to carry around. Inside, the only real differences are that the Baronius Press one has an Imprimatur, which I like because it means that it has been approved by the Church, and it has supplements for the USA, England Wales and Scotland (Angelus only has a supplement for the USA). Other than that, there really isn't much to choose between them, but given that the Baronius edition is $5 cheaper also, I think it is the better value option."
4,I'll try to make this Short. The Best one I've used.,"I've used many of the pre Vatican II missals to include but not limited to the New Marian Missal, the St Andrew's Daily Missal, The Roman Missal (Fr. Lasance), and the St Joseph's Missal. I like this one better than all of them. It's very clear and easy to follow, it has an easy to read index, it has very useful explanations throughout the mass and many days throughout the year which are helpful to me and to friends who attend the Latin mass with me who are not as familiar, it has rubrics which kinda tell you what the priest is doing in case it's difficult to follow him, and I could go on.Con: the only con that I have for this missal and the ONLY reason that I took one star is that it's imitation leather here on Amazon, but that's an easy fix at [...] They offer a Very nice leather one for $68.00 I gave my imitation leather one away and now I have the Leather one."
5,"Beauty is more than... ""in the eye of the beholder.""","If you are a Catholic with more of a ""traditional"" bent, perhaps growing up in the Church of the Latin (Tridentine) Mass, this Missal is for you.It is beautifully bound and printed and regardless if purchased for yourself or given as a gift, it will become someone's prized possession.It would be a good idea to buy a liturgical year pamphlet/calendar as an accompanying reference, very handy indeed"
5,Superb Missal,"Excellent typeset, binding, and content. I strongly recommend it for any catholic who is fed up with the ""new mass""....."
4,"Not ""Leather Bound""","This is an excellent missal, but it is bound in cheap plastic, not leather. I e-mailed Amazon about this, but they chose not to change the listing."
5,The Inner Spirit of Rachmaninov,"Nikolai Lugansky, once met through recordings or performance, is an electric personality and an exciting, handsome performer. He has the Russian Spirit that enhances the repertoire closest to him and that 'soulful' energy serves him well on this splendid recording of the Rachmaninov two sets of Études-Tableaux, Opus 33 and Opus 39.Each of these sets contains nine pieces that manage to cover the gamut of pianistic expression, reminding us that Rachmaninov was a popular concert pianist in this country before his death. Lugansky tackles the both the breakneck speed where required and the lingering liquid angst of the slow etudes. His technique is sparkling and his ability to carry Rachmaninov's 'heart on the sleeve' romanticism with respect makes him rather unique.This is a fine recording in all ways - interpretively and in production values. Highly recommended. Grady Harp, September 05"
2,"Get Paid to Shop, Eat & More!","""You get what you pay for"" The information was nothing new. It had some good points and summaries. I would not put this publication on the top of my best buys list."
2,Given all the choices out there -- choose another book,"I bought this book in hopes of understanding better how to buy my first home. It did in fact help with a number of questions I had (though many remain). But what really hurts this book is the author's confusion with math. Several of the formulae in the book are just wrong (like how to calculate your debt-to-income ratio). His comparisons of various loan options are also useless. I'll give two examples: (1) he compares ARMs to fixed-rate mortgages during a historical period during which interest rates dropped like a rock, so it was already clear which would look better; (2) in another example he prefers a 30-year, low point but high rate loan to a 20-year, high point but low rate loan based solely on the monthly payments -- no mention of the relative paydown of the loan's principal. There was a lot of useful info in this book, but since there are so many options in this genre, I would suggest you look elsewhere. I am returning this book tomorrow."
5,Great Help!,"When I purchased this book I had very little knowledge about real estate or lending. After reading the book, successfully buying my first home and now preparing to buy my first rental property, I must say that Mr. Eilers book is truly amazing. I have followed his methods, formulas and tips and tricks to the tee and they ALL work! My realtor even borrowed the book until she could puchase one of her own. I have now purchased and read four real estate books and none were nearly as helpful, complete or as easy to understand as this book. Not only does the book help with real estate, it is also very helpful in the area of finance. Thanks for helping me buy my first and second homes."
3,bought for graduate school,"I bought this book for a graduate class I was taking at Mercer University. It was helpful and gave a lot of insight into literacy instruction and is useful. I have been able to implement some of the ideas into my classroom, which is great."
5,Practical solutions for menifesting your dreams,"Your heart's desire is one of the greatest how-to books that helps to menifest anything you want in life. I like that Sonia has integrated her true life's experiences corresponding to each principles of menifestation. Even though it relates a lot to spirituality, it is so practical and not so abstract to me. I recommend everyone that if you want to make the dream come true, you can't miss this book.Hopefully this review helps. God bless!"
3,Good but not great.,"An interesting approach to manifesting one's goals, if you don't know where to start.I did think the book relied a little too heavily on anecdotes though. I didn't expect to be paying for Mrs. Choquette's client histories.Life altering? Nah. It would be wrong to say that any book was responsible for mnaking your life over. You have to do that."
4,fantastic,i love this book. it really helped me get organized with my thoughts and desires. its simple and inspiring. what a great book for times like these.
5,Highly motivational! The only way to live your life!,"It's as if Sonia's speaking to you personally in this book, sharing her wisdom and promoting the power of positive self talk. Recommended!"
5,This is life changing and just so wonderful!,"Not only did this help me personally, I'll be able to pass along a lot of the ideas in readings and seminars. This is exactly what I needed in order to help others so much more, and it's already made a big difference for me and I haven't quite finished it yet."
5,Your Hearts Desire,"This book written by Sonia Choquette truly helps you put your life in order, it guides you to focus on what you desire in life. It teachs you to get rid of the baggage, move forward and take responsiblity for your actions. It not only teachs you, but makes you a believer that ""our thoughts do create"", over and over again you practice Sonia's methods and over and over she proves to you it does work. Soon you learn to live each day doing what she says and each day your life becomes the life you have always desired. Soon you are really living your Hearts Desire."
5,Top-notch guide to creating the life you want,"Sonia Choquette has a real talent for synthesizing and clarifying the information available on creating the life you want. She's been at it for more than 20 years, and her talents as intuitive and teacher combine in a simple nine step process that makes Divine power available to us all. We are all truly gods and goddesses, and this book shows us how to best use our natural talent to create. God(dess) bless Sonia for bringing this information to me and to the rest of the world"
5,Figaro Rules!!!,This is such a fantastic opera. The sound quality is impeccable. I'm pleased beyond compare. Figaro definatly rules in the opera world.
5,The visual beauty of an Ancient African Tradition,"From the point of view of a new Olorisa, (initiated Priestess) Santeria Garments and Alters was like a breath of fresh air in an environment which usually does little to support Traditional religious practises. The photographs are honouring to our Orisas and beautifully done. The authors tell the story of the creation of the works of art designed to pay homage to the Orisas in a way in which both the aleyo (non-initiated) and the experienced Olorisa may understand. Santeria Garments and Alters is a ""must-have"" for anyone who must build alters or other sacred spaces as well as for those who seek to learn about the artistic nature of our rich spiritual Tradition. Iyawo Omi Saide"
1,Certainly NOT a good choice,I bought one for my wife and it broke not even two months after getting it.
5,"Thrawn, a really bad guy?","This is a good book,really good (hence the 5 stars) However, Thrawn really isn't that bad of a guy in this book. He's a bad man but not an EVIL MAN. . . but thrawn is cool anyway I was cheering him on ever since the first book."
5,I have read this book 5 times,"And each time it gets better and better. This is, without a doubt, my favorite fictional book. E.V.E.R. There is some deeper sense that always gets me to return to this book. It is well written, and like I said to the first book in the series, does not borrow heavily on the films and when it does, in a good way. The ending, while somewhat predictable was also somewhat of a major plot twist that had your jaw drop to the floor as Mara Jade, the Emperor's top private assassin trained to use the Force and her final mission given to her by the Emperor to kill Skywalker, confronts Luuke Skywaler in a duel to the death."
5,Great Ending to a Top-Quality Story,"Greatest trilogy next to the original saga I've ever read. For that matter, this has to this day been the best story I've ever read and is what really got me into reading books. The story throughout all three books was so well written and had me so entranced I can't honestly pick a favorite. If Hollywood really needs some help making a decent movie again, I would love to see this story on screen."
4,Almost Perfect. Almost...,"I loved this book except for one thing: the big finale between Luke and the bad Jedi. I guess a fight is a fight is a fight, and even a good writer can't do much new with one. Still, great characters, wonderful scheming and counter-scheming, and a sense of wonder that are sorely missing from the new film. And the way Thrawn gets his come-upance was brilliant. Bring on the new books!"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"""Just when the Republic thought that the insidious and unfortunatelyvery clever Thrawn could sink no lower, he does. In other words, sendin the clones!This gives him the manpower (clonepower?) he needs to crew enoughships to blow the guts out of lots of the Republic forces andfortresses.Han and Chewie must gain aid from a smuggler fleet, to try and stop Thrawn. Luke contends with the evil Jedi Master C'Boath.Leia, very heavily pregnant, desperately tries to hold things together politically."
2,coruscant,"After reading ''Dark Force Rising'', I had to get this book. Very slowmoving. A few good parts(Leia gives birth, Bel Iblis) but not much there."
4,"Zahn is brilliant, but I just didn't like that much.","Timothy Zahn is one of my favorite writers, and this is the only Star Wars related material I've ever read. I really liked how he used the characters and made them seem like they were carrying on right after the old movies.But the ending seemed kind of well, boring. If you haven't read it I'm not necessarily going to give it away but It was just anti-climatic. Also, why is Mara Jade learns and grows just as much in the force as Luke does in 4 days in the jungle as Luke does throughout his whole life. The clone thing at the end was kind of dumb, but overall it was a good book and a good triology. The only Star Wars material I'm ever going to read."
2,Very disappointing,Zahn's writing style is terrible and made me abandon reading this series. I read 'Heir to the Empire' and listened to 'Dark Forces Rising' and 'The Last Command' on audio cassette because I wanted to know what happened but I didn't want the pain of reading the second two parts of the trilogy.The ysalamiri are ridiculous - a sort of kryptonite for the Jedi - as is C'Boath the dark Jedi Master. How come we hadn't heard of these before - they would have been pretty difficult to keep secret. And the way Thrawn can anticipate any bluff or double bluff and never be wrong makes him unbelievable as well. Mara Jade is a good character though.I suggest people read the X-Wing series first which is much better or even 'The Truce at Bakura' which is well written.
3,overrated but better than most star wars books,"the thrawn trilogy is ok at best and really overrated. the writing style really hurts the books and takes away from the good story and interesting characters. we don't really need to be informed every time someone has to 'connect to the force', or runs through jedi meditation techniques, etc. it has to be implied at some point really."
1,Horrible book (trilogy),"I REALLY hope this is not the story that they will film as the ""what-happend-after-Return-Of-The-Jedi"". Because they will ruin EVERYTHING. Nice sympathy points for ""let's-rememberaized-what-happened/the characters-in-the-Star-Wars-Trilogy"". To me Mara Jade, Thrawn, Talon Karde don't even exist on Star Wars."
5,This trilogy sets the standard!,"Heir to the Empire, Dark force Rising, The Last CommandThe Good:The idea of a grand admiral in control of the emperor's legacy is brilliant.An insane dark jedi, clone soldiers, a coalition of smugglers, jedi twins and on and on goes Mr Zahn.Adventure, ha, Excitement, ha, a reader cares about these things!!The Bad:Absolutely noting.Conclusion:This trilogy sets the standard for all other writers. It is that good! Thank you Mr. Zahn"
5,Awesome!,"I don't know what to say except awesome. It was so artistically done. I got hooked. Long live Mara, killer of C'baoth!"
5,THE BEST OF THE STAR WARS BOOKS,"This is the one SW book that is worthy of being compared to the movie. If you don't read any other Star Wars books, read the Thrawn trilogy. Zahn has superb characterization. The characters feel like they did in the movie. The villains, Grand Admiral Thrawn & C'boath were brilliantly evil unlike some of the others I have seen in the other novels. I love the way Thrawn can figure out his enemies actions from a few scraps of evidence or from their artwork. They should make the trilogy into a movie. By far, this is the best of the Star Wars novels. You can't get any better than this."
2,Great book but chapters are missing,"This is a fantastic trilogy but chapters 26 & 27 are missing. This is especially bad because its during the final battle with Cboath. Not cool, not cool at all."
5,Best Star Wars book written to date,"This whole trilogy gets five stars. This book in particular is perhaps the best Star Wars book that has been written since the original trilogy. I recommend that any Star Wars fan reads this trilogy before anything else, because it will permanently hook you to the Star Wars novel universe. The perfect book."
5,The author of this book knew what he was doing.,So many times you'll find a book about a certain series and it just doesn't fit with what everyone else wrote.Not this one. It fits perfectly with everything that had been writen before it.He explains everything very well and puts it all together with great style. He spends enough time with each of the characters so you know what's going on but not to much so you know exactly what's going to happen.The climax at the end of it was truly worth the Star Wars name. Well done Mr. Zahn!! My favorite part of the book was the last chapter although I think he should have gone a little farther
4,Luke vs. himself,"Overall a pretty good book, I mean it wasn't much different than the first two. Still enjoyable, however, and utterly hilarious. When C'Baoth whips out Luuke I just cracked up. That was the funniest part of the book and I still can't stop laughing. It may not seem funny to you, but think about how lame it is to create an evil Jedi and in the final showdown with the hero, have him bust out a clone with the same name as your hero- except with an extra u! Ha ha ha ha..... Read this book and see what I mean yourself :)"
5,This was my fav of the Trilogy,I liked this one the best. Mara Jade has to be one of the coolest Star Wars characters (I'm SO glad she and Luke are getting married!!). In my opinion she is the star of this book.
5,Audio Rendition is Excellent,"Timothy Zahn tops himself with a slap bang ending to this Star Wars saga. There is not much I can add to other reviews. However, the audio book is abridged and some of the story seems to skip forward at high speed. Once again Anthony Daniels (C3PO) does a great job reading. His voice characterizations are the same as in ""Dark Force Rising"" allowing the listener to keep the many characters straight and concentrate on the plot(s). The audio and special effects are crisp and clear and easily understood in a car environment. The best of the three books and well worth the purchase price. Run time: 180 minutes."
5,"Excellent, grabs you and doesn't let go!","The final book in the Thrawn Trilogy doesn't disappoint fans. Zahn is an excellent writer, and does justice to the characters we've seen before, and gives us a wide variety of new characters to meet and explore. Once into this book, I wasn't able to stop reading! It's a sure-fire hit with any Star Wars fan."
5,Zahn: Greatest Star Wars Author,"This book is quite possibly the best book ever written. It concludes the trilogy in true Star Wars fashion. I couldn't put the book down, it is fast-paced and non-stop. A great book. If you feel that some questions are left unanswered (Luke and Mara, what Fey'la is so concerned with the New Republic finding) then read Zahn's ""Spector of the Past"" and ""Vision of the Future"" They will answer any questions you have. All in all, Zahn is the greatest Star Wars author ever."
3,Tragic.,Thrawn is story about how a military genius who has no equal in the universe is outdone by luck.
3,"Good, but lacking in some areas","A decent conclusion to the Zahn trilogy. A few problems with it though: I found the fact that Fey'lya was still on the new republic counsel after what he did in the last book ridiculous. Also, the ending battles, both in space and in the throne room had some flaws. The smugglers part in the space battle made little sense. As well, Mara destroying both of the enemies in the throne room was also disappointing. Overall, the trilogy was decent reading, but it did not feel like star wars."
2,A typical happy-ending farytail in the classic SW universe.,"When you've read this book you think - Oh Thats It !? The Last Command features the same story as the other SW books/movies: A large and ruthless Empire that wants to eliminate all enemies. But then as always the good guys win and every body's happy - except the reader ! This is just so trivia. You never se the situations from the Empires point of view. How does the avereage private man feel about this. You only read about the good old rebellion witch dosent stand a chance, but wins anyway !!! Don't spend your money on this if you're not a SW freak"
4,Great ending to a Great Trilogy,"The Last Command is by far the best of Timothy Zahn's Star Wars trilogy, and the best of all Star Wars books. As I read this, I could so easily picture this book as if it were another Episode in the Star Wars movies, and could almost hear the unforgettable music from Star Wars. Unlike other Star Wars books, the plot is nice and simple; good vs. evil, exactly like the movies. What drew me to the Star Wars movies was the mythological aspect, and The Last Command conveys this almost better than the movies."
4,Pretty much one of the best,"I loved this book. The only problem I had was when Karrade tried to form a ""Smuggler's Alliance"". I was barely able to keep my eyes open long enough to get interested. I really, really like the part at the end, where Luke is fighting the clone Luuke Skywalker. By the way Zahn, if you ever read this, what's up with the double U in clones name? Anyway, I burst out laughing when the Noghri caught Fey' Lya evesdropping. He claimed he wasn't. A brain-damaged Trandoshan would know better than that."
5,A Star wars fan -must -read!,This book was great! I could not but it down. Star Wars fans will love it! Timothy Zahn brings the Charecters to life!
3,"Product 4, Software 0",When I dropped my original MD player I had to replace it in a hurry. I didn't think to look to closely at this product and wish I would have. My original one allowed me to record to MDs by several different ways. With this one you can only go directly from a computer to it. Also no microphone function on this one either. There is also no ability to use AC with this so you will be stuck using batteries.The software that comes with this is not very user friendly but once you get the hang of it you might not think it is so terrible.
3,It only took Sony 12 years to get MiniDisc right.....,"...But still to expensive. One of the big letdowns when MiniDiscs first came out was it inability to upload recorded content up to a computer [say live , music performance, recorded meetings etc] But Sony was SO worried about this that consumers might make copies of music they hobbled MiniDisc for the better part of a decade when it could have replaced the cassette as a primary portable music device...In the end Sony's hobbling didn't prevent the rise of Napster and file sharing did it?At least this current species of MiniDisc did alot more than its older cousins, but by then it was too late and Sony yet once again lost to another company, even with its larger 1GB disc you can still carry alot more on a basic MP3 player... The only good it can do would be to record live music/meetings and such but there are better and smaller equipment out there.At one point in time the term Walkman was king... now its poop."
3,Hardware-4 Software-0,"PROS- Sony makes good hardware- no doubt. Great sound. Great battery life. Good storage capacity. I like the mini disc concept.CONS- Sucky software. The mini disc format would have so much more potential if the software were better. I can't imagine anyone describing the software as good.The control dial & buttons are tiny and not very intuitive. For instance, they're difficult to use with gloves or without both hands.However, if you could use other software, like Music Match or i-Tunes on these mini disc products, Sony would have a winner-"
1,Trash,"I bought this product three months ago, and it is already broken, making it the second SONY product that I have gone through in six months. I wrote a review a couple months back after I had first bought it thinking that it was a great product and that I would be perfectly satisfied over an iPod. My opinion has now changed, as I have now been so enlightened to notice that SONY as a whole has gone downhill, and I will not in fact be buying the PlayStation 3 I had so anticipated now that I am seeing that SONY has chosen the path of faulty and tmeperamental products. Microsoft has just gained one more customer. Heed my words: under no circumstances should you buy this product. Just save your money and buy an iPod."
4,great..,"the player itself is great and all that blabla... but I just have to point out sonys software (like a lot of us :))ive been trying to get sonicstage to work for days.. at first when I installed it, everything was ok. and when I ran it, it said that I had an old version so it wants to update (it wasnt a must) so silly me, I did as it asked. the next thing I know (after installing for 10 minutes) it had a file missing.. now how could that happen? I only used original software and there is sth missing.. anyway, its openMG. www.openmg.com is down too. cant get that thing from nowwhere.so any suggestons on how to solve this, mail me l10n@hot.eethe full name that it needed was ""openmg secure module.msi"""
4,Very good.,"Firstly and most importantly, this hardware is excellent given the price. You can use regular 80 minutes MD disk which cost $1 to store 300MB of music. Since atracplus 64k sounds as good as mp3 128k, you can store 600MB music on $1 very small disk. This system is better than CD player since it is smaller and it is better than regular flash player since I don't need to start up my computer to change the music or I don't need to buy expensive memory card.The reason I gave 4 star is because of its software. It works fine. If you have sonic stage 3.0, you just need to install MD driver and computer will recognize your devide. But please remember for every step you need to be very patient. I don't think my lap top is particulary outdated. Sotic stage is very slow. Be patient. After you transfered your music to disk, you don't need to see it again.By the way, mine came with 5 downloads coupon for Connect. Given the price, isn't it very nice?"
2,Just OK,"This is the second minidisc player I've owned. My first one (Sony MZ-R30) was exceptional in quality so maybe it isn't fair to compare the two... but this newer one is slow to respond, awkward to open, and the control panel is slightly hard to see. The sound is fine. My main complaint is the slow operating speed and clumsiness of opening it to insert the disc. I probably would not recommend this item unless you don't care about ease of use."
3,Excellent hardware. Software: No comments!,"Before buying it, answer the question: How do you usually get your tracks? I am just talking about legal sources.If you have those 400+ CD collection at home, then this is the right hardware for you. Use the Net MD simple burner software, and you can live reasonably happy. The sound and ease of use are excellent and will compensate some frustration with the software such as check in check out.. (forget sonic stage at all!!)If you buy your music online, no matter where (Napster, Walmart, Itunes, etc..), then forget it! Before you get used to all the work around, such as burn all of them into CD's, them upload them and then edit the tag information for each track or so, you will want to get rid of it immediately... Unfortunately Sony hasn't woken up for the new digital world yet (Will they someday?)"
4,Good Book !! Easy To Read !!!,This is a very good book to catch up on your NOVELL material and get to know NW5. I Do recomend it but the quality of the Sample Questions is not that good. You can pass the test with this book but a good score needs a bit more. NW5 Admin Test is Long and Demanding and covers every single topic including Command Parameters and Lots of NWAdmin Simulation Questions and screens from the actual product. Read Every Single Page and Line in this book Carefully.
3,Good Supplemental Source,"If you are using this book to pass the three tests it claims tocover good luck, especially if you don't have either hands onexperience or a secondary training source. This book does manage to cover most of the material on the tests, but the practice questions are a joke. Also, the book spends lots of time on sections that have few related questions to the actual test, while skimming some sections that will be tested extensively."
3,Fair,"I bought this book for CNA examination. However the practice of the book is not explained in details. So if you are a novice, study more materials before examination."
1,Has a well designed cover!,"Everything between the covers is a disappointment. I've used several Sybex books and I don't recommend this one at all. If you know nothing of Netware, this will give you an overview, but lacks details on specific subjects. There are a few subjects that it covers some-what in depth, but doesn't cover some of the basic fundementals. I found this especially true for the CNA portion. As far as the other exams it claims to cover (640 & 634) they too fall short. My suggestion, don't use it as your primary study source."
2,Looking to certify? Look elsewhere. . .,"NetWare 5 CNA(SM)/CNE: Administration and Design Study Guide is a decent book about NetWare 5, but a study guide it is not.If you have little or no prior experience with NetWare, don't even try to pass the Administration test by just studying this book. It skimps on a lot of important info that the test hits you hard on, and omits other things entirely (correct syntax for the command-line utilities FLAG, NDIR and FILER are a good example - the test can get pretty detailed on these).Find a better study guide and supplement it with practice-testing software - CNEQUIZR [online] is a good one."
2,Not a Study Guild,"I must agree with the other reviewers. I have used other Sybex book and found them very helpful. This one however.......If you have ALOT of experince with 4.11 and/or can set up a 5.0 network in your home, this MIGHT help. If not, it can cause you to fail the exam.The book can leave you feeling overconfident, like me. I read the chapters, did the study review (both in the book and online) and did great with them. Today I took the test and FAILED! The book dose not prep you for the type of questions Novell asks nor the style of Novell testing - that freaked me out more then anything (it is not like Microsoft) and may have helped in my poor performance.The book is a good overview of Netware 5.0, put that is all it is"
4,Great for those looking to Update,"I used this book for the NetWare 4.x to NetWare 5 Update test. I found it very helpfull for that purpose. I was already proficient in previous versions of NetWare so I can't comment on it from the ""newbie"" perspective. For those looking to update, this book with a package from SelfTest Software will make a good combo."
4,Well-written and easy to understand,"This book is a great explanation of Netware. It's the best of the printed materials I've seen on the topic (Novell's own study kit book is horrible by comparison). I just passed the CNA exam, and felt well-prepared, though I agree with other reviewers that you should always use more than one study aid. The one weakness of this book is that the questions at the end of the chapters are not much like the actual test, though in all fairness, it would be impossible to simulate the test in a written format. I also used Self Test Software's exam simulation, which was awesome--just like the real thing."
4,"Comfortable, could use a little more support","These are my third favorite thong. They are soft, comfortable, and attractive, but they are a bit too stretchy for me. While my stuff doesn't fall out, it does kind of pool in the bottom, which is not exactly what I'm looking for in a thong.If you're looking for a soft microfiber thong with good support, check outJM Skinz Thong."
1,Belkin USB-Serial adapter,"Not at all happy with this device. The claim ""compatible with all serial devices"" the reality is it is not . I wanted to connect my LaserWriter to my iMac (serial to USB). After much frustration I called Belkin and was told that this product does not support LaserWriter printers. Belkin was not very helpful and returning the product means I am out the shipping. If you are considering this product call to get specific compatiblity specs."
1,Not for large Adult,"I thought this would be a good choice after reading the reviews, however it was not. I bought a Schwinn for my wife which was perfect, and this one for me. I'm 6 foot 250 lbs..This bike is way too small. When I peddle, it makes a clicking sound on every rotation. The sound comes from the gear box. Not good! The cost to send it back would be too much so I seem to be stuck with a lemon. If your a large adult...don't buy this bike!"
2,good bike,It came with a few bended parts but other than that it was a great bike for the money.very easy to put together..bought this for my 16 year old son
5,The Deck I insist my students use.,"I've been reading Tarot for over 30 years and since the early 90's I have insisted that all of my students use this deck. The illustrations are richly detailed without being ""noisy"". The colors give strong vibrational input and the images are not so overly ""styled"" as to be useless. I know some Pagans will hesitate because of some of the Christian images, but within the context of a primarily Judeo-Christian culture, I find them useful and descriptive of most of the ""seeking"" public. The fact that the ""Devil"" is now ""Materialism"", and ""Death"" is ""Transformation"", makes them particularly useful in reading for the public. I've seen clients nearly faint at the sight of either card and it can be nearly impossible to convince some of them that they aren't doomed or cursed. Overall, I find this the most useable deck for teaching and reading."
3,It's a dumbed down Rider-Waite,"Having bought one of Connolly's decks, I decided to buy her deck as well, which were described as a great improvement over the Rider-Waite deck.The art *is* impressive - it's vivid and, in contrast to Rider-Waite's 'flat' images, has depth which makes it look 3D.The problem is that the symbolism is lost. The devil card has become materialism - just one aspect of the card, and the contrast is easy to see in the Death card - all the symbols have vanished in favour of making a simple image to symbolize transition.The comparison between the publisher's bombastic declaration made a decade ago that the deck would surely take the place of the Rider-Waite deck and the deck's popularity today (any decent shop has at least 4 Rider-Waite decks on it's shelves, while hardly any puts on the shelve, or has, Connoly's deck) attests to the difference in quality between the decks."
4,connally tarot deck,"This was my second tarot deck. Although, I've accumulated over 7 decks, this is the one I use for most of my readings. I find that the colors & presentation are extremely useful to most clients. I feel that the traditional sybolism is easier for the average client to comprehend. In turn, I find that the ""materialism"" and ""transition"" cards make it easier for the client to comprehend the true meaning of these cards without the element of fear that often comes up with the death and devil cards. In short, I have found that this deck is the best one for the client that has not experienced many readings. It's also the one I use for my own readings because of it's shear beauty!"
4,Authentic Listening and Critical Thinking for ESL Students,"I have used this book with accompanying tape with my upper-intermediate and advanced ESL students and it has been a hit. (This is NOT baby-pre-school reading level. I would put it more at about 7th or 8th grade...)They use authentic interviews from National Public Radio for the listening segments. The exercises are fairly good, particularly in the area of conversation. Some of the listening comphrehension exercises could be better-written though. The audio segments are rather long and divided into only 2 parts.I'm a big fan of the entire North Star Focus on Listening and Speaking Series (It's in 4 parts--basic, intermediate, upper-intermediate, advanced.). The topics are always interesting to students, and the units are arranged according to grammar function.This book works in conjunction with the North Star Focus on Reading and Writing, as well as the Focus on Grammar series."
2,"Makes coffee, but also leaks coffee","When you buy a cheap coffee maker, you get cheap quality. Maker works fine, but unless it's been sitting for a couple hours it will lose coffee onto the warming place when you remove the pot. Annoying and gets old."
1,Poor quality,This coffee maker is terrible! It leaks and always leaves grounds in the coffee. Cheaper is not better.
1,avoid,"i broke the carafe for my braun coffee maker and headed over to target to get a new one. they didn't have any, so i decided to pick up the least expensive coffee maker, since this was for work. bad idea!1) reservoir: if you over-fill the reservoir, there are two holes in the back of the unit that the water pours out of. absolutely ridiculous; why not make the reservoir the right size?2) the hot water spout: it pivots to allow one to remove the coffee basket. surely there could have been a better way of engineering this.3) one lid for water and coffee: when one lifts the lid to remove the spent grounds after brewing, the condensation under the uni-lid streams back into the water reservoir and you get a big puff of nice hot steam as you reach for the spent grounds. ridiculous and dangerous!4) flat bottom filters: soooo 70s."
5,Cheap yet works just fine.,"I'm not sure why this coffee maker has generated so many negative reviews.Water doesn't leak from it unless you overfill it. If the holes weren't in the back to prevent this, you'd end up brewing hot coffee all over your countertop. I've poured about a dozen cups of coffee from the carafe without spilling a single drop. Fast pour or slow pour, it works just fine. I haven't had any grounds in my coffee, and I've used up to 9 tablespoons of coffee in generic paper filters.My complaints... the condensation under the lid pours back into the resevoir when you open it, and the price could be better. I bought mine in a local store for cheaper (excluding tax). The removable basket is nice for cleaning, but you can't remove it to fill because it doesn't sit flat on the countertop."
1,Industrial coffee,"Do not buy this coffee maker.I bought one for my business waiting room, and the coffee tastes like the same swill no matter how good of coffee you use to make it. Mine has not leaked or broken yet like the other reviewers say, but the awful tasting coffee is enough. Definitely a $19.99 coffee maker.Don't bother."
1,Looking for a new coffee maker.,"I agree with the other reviewers. My husband and I hate this machine. We have only had it a few months and the coating on the heating plate has peeled away not to mention that when we take out the pot to pour, the maker always drips. I would definitely not recommend this coffee maker."
1,The dirty dribbler,"I have a white machine which has a different name on it but is made in exactly the same shape and style including the 2 holes in the back of the reservoir. You can give it a complete scrubdown mading it nice and white, but if you look at it, it's dirty again. The main malfunction is that when you pour a cup of coffee, it dribbles all over the place thus I'm wiping the counter and mopping the floor about 20 times a day."
1,Mr. Junk - Tossed it in my condo dumpster.,"The most annoying thing on this piece of junk is the cafe drips 75% of the time when you pour a cup of coffee. My countertop are constantly being cleaned due to this nonsense. In addition, you have the mystery water leak, maybe it's haunted or something-- who knows? Finally, the thing is so lightweight, I had to put duck tape underneath this plastic junk to stop it from moving around.Mine is in the dumpster as of today, I would not even waste my time to stand in line to return this--- going back to Braun, cost more but no drips."
5,AWESOME CD,"I really REALLY like this cd. I had heard of Norway once or twice when I stumbled across it, but after I noticed that Ronnie Martin (Joy Electric) helped mix it I bought it and was not dissapointed. It sounds like this guy was having SERIOUS girl problems and wrote the whole cd on it. Alot of the lyrics are depressing, set to happy music, with a really neat effect. I've listened to it nonstop since!"
2,Not great but not quite horrid.,"Norway can cut a good dance track; that's undisputed. But that one dance track seems to appear on this album under several different titles(i.e. every song on the disc). Not enough differentiation from track to track to merit a good review, due in part to dull, monotonous beats."
1,Horrible Physics Book,"This book is hard to follow and quite wordy thus not worth the money. Very few meaningful example problems are given and only the simplest equations are given. The physics problems after each chapter are pointless for more advanced classes. Their pictures featured with the reading did not make complete sense as the caption was confusing. I do not recommend this book, buy GIANCOLI instead."
5,Can't get enough of Il Divo,"I was thrilled to get the ""Live at the Greek Theatre"" cd. To watch the four divine singers perform and interact with each other was great but secondary to the beautiful music they belt out. To start in a ""pop"" fashion and finish in the climatic ""opera"" genre is thrilling to see and hear. On this cd you get to know David, Carlos, Sebastian and the adorable Urs."
4,"Pleasing, but not outstanding","My wife and I enjoyed this live performance, we are real fans. There are better performances on their records, but it is fun to see them live."
4,"Il Divo Not ""Divas""","Three classically trained singers and a pop star -- none of whom take themselves too seriously -- combine to make this video an enjoyable experience. Grab a bottle of good wine, your honey, and settle in for a romantic evening!"
1,Rip off,"The ""orchestra"" was so loud one could barely hear the singers...a very unprofessional DVD...the ""sighing"" girlies"" in audience had better coverage than the rest offered (and they weren't much"".) I'll stick with DVD's starring Andre Rieu which are always Five Star and then some. Live and Learn!"
5,spectacular,one of the best shows i have ever had the pleasure of seeing. enjoyed every minute of the show. do not miss this one.
5,they are the best,"This quartet is the absolute BEST voices I've ever heard PLUS The best good looking. BRAVO, BRAVO, BRAVO!!!!!"
3,Not that good,"We are music lovers but this four signers don,t seem to join together their voices smoothly. It was quite a surprise for us when we agreed to turn off the dvd and change it for bocelli."
3,Bummer...,"I bought this DVD for Dearest-On-Earth for part of her Christmas present. What a rip! Seriously! Neither ""Whip It"" or ""Satisfaction"" are on it! I mean, like, ""New Kidz On The Block go to Vienna"" or something..."
5,Beautiful music--great buy,"This beautiful collection of music arrived very quickly(before Christmas, as promised) and was just as described. All in all, a great buying experience."
4,This Is a Great Christmas Gift !,"I saw Il Divo in concert in Dallas, a week before their DVD performance. This is VERY GOOD concert DVD, but I have to tell you, they are even better and more powerful in person. I have decided that the guys ""hold back"" some when they know they are being recorded.If you're interested in turning on a friend to this talented group of singers, this is the perfect gift!"
4,Fantastic,"I purchased this DVD concert, with many extras included on the DVD for my Mother. She is overwhelmed at being able to watch this powerful concert, day after day.If this is your type of music, then I highly recommend this DVD of Il Divo - Live at the Greek."
2,cantantes excelentes...DVD de poca calidad!!,"La calidad de este DVD deja mucho que desear, a pesar de las maravillosas voces de los cantantes, la musica opaca las voces. Me deslilusiono."
4,a true fan but ...,i love il divo's songs. but the problem with this DVD is that they don't make the audio quality very well. the songs must be played with state of the art audio systems to get somewhere close to what the actual concert was like. They lowered the fan's applauses so low that it wasn't even funny. It was like the fans wer clapping... and there were no sound to the clapping barely.
4,Lots of sound advice for coaches and players,I wasn't as interested in the details of Claudio's professional career as the work he put in during his formative years - the things he did as a kid that made him successful as an adult. Lot's of good advice about how to practice and the importance of passing. Should be required reading for soccer coaches in the US.
3,TV segment faulty,"Bought a GT5032 and got a replacement for it because the TV tuner was faulty out of the box. The replacement was faulty too. The TV tuner is the ATI Theater 550 Pro TV Tuner. Techs worked on both, including downloading software from ATI but the TV picture continued to skip/stutter and eventually it would freeze after about 30 minutes. I'm returning the second one for a refund."
2,Unpolished storyline,"I really want to like this series, but the published books seem so unfinished. Seems to me she needs a new editor. Once again, character development is lacking as are development of relationships between characters. She turns her characters into lovers without giving the reader much of a reason for them to be falling into bed with eachother.There are also some MAJOR plotholes in this story. In fact, this story has one of the biggest plotholes I have EVER read in a published book. I don't want to give too much storyline away but the plothole I am speaking of involves one of the police suspects for murder. The author tries to make us believe that the police would suspect a 14 year old girl for the brutal rape and beating death of her mother??"
3,Not What I Expected,"I expected to learn a little bit more about Casper. I was also expecting Anna to learn about this legacy people keep mentioning to her. I also thought she would settle some things between her and Max. Instead, I got a mystery about a teenage girl that runs away. There is no furthering of any of the things mentioned above. I get a little irritated with series that never end and only give us a tiny taste of what is to come eventually. The story was well written and entertaining, and can almost stand alone as simply a mystery book. However, I'm going to need a little more plot progression to continue with this series."
4,Outstanding book in the paranormal fantsy genre,"This is a very interesting book. Anna is still trying to adjust her life when she and her parents find out that Carylons missing daughter Trish is Anna's older brother Steve's daughter. Lots of good plot twists some a bit improbable and then relation between Anna and Frey seems promising. Shifters in this story but also empaths and psychics. Nicely drawn characters and a little humor. Anna is becoming more reconciled to the changes in her and to the changes in her life.Unfortunately there were a number of annoying errors and inconsistencies. Among them were digital cameras (they don't do video or audio), tinted frames--nice but you really want tinted lenses, and ""his gums peeled back..."" lips yes but if his gums peeled back he has a really serious dental problem, Annoying enough to prevent it from getting 5 stars.Still an outstanding read in an outstanding series."
5,Absolute must hear,"Better Days, along with House of Bones, are two of the greatest CDs on the planet, period. Steve White was a true artist, the real deal. Great music played and sung by a man who, unfortunately, never got the recognition he deserved, at least in the U.S. Blues, folk and jazz, his music incorporates elements of different genres and can't be put into a single category. Every song is a gem. Steve could make you laugh and he could make you cry. A great voice, a driving and tasteful guitar style, killer harmonica and solid percussion - Steve was literally a one-man band. Don't take my word for it - check out some of the video footage of him on Youtube and you'll get an idea of what the man was about. Also check out his website - Stevewhiteblues.com - and turn the sound up. The world will never know another like him. If you like Dylan, Ry Cooder or Tom Waits, then Steve White will knock your sox off."
1,love2shop,"I was very disappointed with this purchase. The cutting board was not the one in the picture, and it was missing two of the four rubber feet on the bottom. I contacted the seller and Amazon. Amazon sent me a free shipping label and refunded my money. The seller was not very helpful."
2,Disappointing,"The fan itself looks just fine - exactly what you'd expect from a Hunter fan. The light cover is kinda ugly IMO. While the shape is nice, glass looks like it was spray painted to make it more opaque. Unattractive. My biggest objection, however, is the light output. This fixture only uses two candelabra bulbs, which come in 60 watts and less. In the evenings, I feel like I'm eating by candlelight, which is not the effect I desire. I'm disppointed. So much so that I am considering replacing this fan, which has only been installed for a couple of weeks."
2,SHALLOW!!!,"I bought 2 of these for my daughter, who loves to cook and loves escargot. When they arrived, I took them out of the package to make sure that they weren't damaged. I'm glad that I did! The holes in the escargot dish were VERY SHALLOW!! You could fit about 1/2 of a large escargot in each hole, and the hole wasn't deep enough for the escargot to 'bask' in the garlic-butter. The garlic-butter would have spread across the entire dish, very thinly. I'd be surprised if the garlic-butter didn't burn. The butter that would've remained in the holes wouldn't be enough to soak toast points. So, I ended up sending these back and buying, more expensive (Revol:Revol Belle Cuisine BC1012-1 7 Inch x 6.25 Inch Escargot Plate, 12 Holes), dishes that held 12 escargot per plate. The holes in the Revol dishes are nice and deep, though they'll still hold only about 1/2 of a large escargot. But, now. there will be plenty of garlic-butter for the toast points!!"
5,Escargot and more,"I have two other sets of escargot dishes. One has the ""onion soup bowel"" handle and is hollow with a breathing hole so dishwater can get into the inside cavity - not good!. They will now go to the garbage. My second set is close to this one but has smaller recesses for the escargot and that's okay for escargot only but they can't be used for stuffed mushrooms as an alternate dish which I can't imagine if you like escargot you would be opposed to, so they will be thrown away also.I have four of these and trust me.... they will get plenty of use in my Snowbird group in Yuma.If you buy some of these and you do not like them (can't imagine that), attach a reply to this and I will buy them off you for a slightly reduced price or hey! maybe you would like a set of my other ones in trade?This is a ""can't go wrong"" purchase."
4,CUTE DOMINO,"This is such a cute thing to get. I intend to put in my play room and when friends are here , they can enjoy this special domino set. When i received it i was so delighted, it has nice box and the quality is good ! Each of the domino tile is solid and the prinitng on it is great!"
2,"Great stories, weak translation","Pramoedya is a master of the short story, and ""Stories from Blora"" is his finest collection. Sadly this translation is often cliched and often shallow. Pramoedya deserves a more nuanced translator than Mr. Samuels. Readers are advised to seek out the stories translated by Benedict Anderson and James Siegel -- scholars who have a far more sophisticated understanding of Indonesia and the author."
4,Extremely attractive with one drawback,"I bought this good-looking outdoor thermometer as a replacement for one we'd had for many years. It works fine and is indeed attractive, but is hard to read from a distance, which defeats the purpose of checking it out on a freezing winter morning. More contrast between the numbers and the gauge would probably be a good idea."
4,Perfect For An Outdoor Room,"I bought this for the stone wall that edges up against my patio. It was easy to hang with my husband's able assistance and it looks beautiful. It provides accurate temperature readings and really dresses up an outdoor room. I take it inside during the winter, but the exposure to the elements has caused it to oxidize and it now has a wonderful rich patina. I'm very happy that I purchased it and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it for its appearance, durability, and accuracy."
5,"Also available as ""An Olde English Christmas""","This wonderful Christmas Album has been reissued on the Decca label and is now known as ""An Olde English Christmas"". Still a great album after all these years."
4,GREAT. NEUTRAL STORY TELLING OF ERIC'S LIFE,"THis book is very good. Schumache portrays Clapton as a musician and man, nothing going into the cheap way of focusing the book around gossips. Even the subject of Conor's death is treated decently. Also, he gives a good portrait of Eric's band mates along time, all his influences, a brief analysis of each album recorded, etc. It's a shame that Clapton didn't give any personal interviews for the book, that I think is best than Ray Coleman's offical biography."
3,Okay,"This book is okay for a real Eric Clapton fan. There are not a lot of pictures, so if you want a more visual book, you may want to select another."
2,"Not really a Chill-Out Trip Hop CD, Not Really a Flamenco CD","You would think that mixing the medatitive and soothing qualities of Flaminco with a ""chill"" trip hop beat and/or background track would be a natural but not with this CD. It delivers neither. It's not a true 'chill out' dance CD - just having mellow music with attempts at soft beats or rhythm doesn't really count. The Flamenco playing is mixed way too low and while I don't claim to be a Flaminco expert, even I can tell it's pretty weak playing so I'm not sure who would really be happy with this CD. It's also not world or new agey enough to use as mediatative as I think most everyone will be displeased with the weak musicianship associated with this CD. Get a soft Flaminco CD and/or stick with the main dance chill CD's series - this one is neither."
3,Lovely set of songs,"This is a good compilation in terms of song selection. All of the duo's major hits are included and especially satisfying is the inclusion of the song ""Just Tell Me You Love Me"" which is not available in any of the other England Dan & John Ford Coley ""best of"" compilations. The duo's music are essentially easy listening pop and soft rock with a country flavour and catchy melodies. The only reason I am not giving this more than a three stars rating is the rather poor sound quality. Considering that this album was released only a few years ago I'm surprised that the tracks were not remastered to enhance the sound. Disappointing!"
3,fun christmas present,Gave it as a christmas present and they liked it. It is made out of wood and very funny (and scary at the same time if you think that they will come alive at night!) lol!
4,Nutcracker,I am very satisfied with this product and it arrived quickly and packed well. My Grandson is a Bears fan and a nutcracker collector and this will be a great stocking stuffer for him. Cant wait to see his face.
3,Love him hated her,"I really have no idea why this mess gets such great buzz year after year. Olive Oil was really a pill, Jack was Jack but the whole thing was just not worth all the effort to stay awake."
3,Really pricy for what it does,"Really pricy. Works but other thingsmuch cheaper work just as well.I will not purchase again, becauseof cost."
4,I'm glad San Fran Opera brought this back,"After reading Faust by Goethe I got interested enough in the author to try The Sorrows of Young Werther and then see the opera. Thank goodness the San Francisco Opera decided to bring it back after a twenty-five year hiatus.This is the first opera I've heard by Massenet. And, granted, it's more of a psychological drama than an action-filled one I enjoyed this more than I thought - event though I had only expected to sort of like it.Carreras and von Stade are very enjoyable in this recording. And I'm looking forward to listening to them even more now that I've seen it performed.The Sorrows of Young WertherMassenet: Werther"
5,Heatwaves BEST!,"As a huge fan of Heatwave who loves all of their work, ""Candles"" is truly a work of art. It's not often you find an album where EVERY song makes you want to immediately skip back and hear it again, and again, and again. This is one group that has never gotten their just due for ALL of the great songs they've written. From ""Gangsters of the Groove"", to ""Turn Around"", to ""Jitterbuggin"", ""Posin til Closin"", ""Dreamin You"", and the melodic ""All I Am"", Candles"" is truly a masterful production that one can never get tired of listening to."
5,Cutting Edge Soundz,"This new comp release from Plastiq Musiq is packed full of new musik from the Echoing Green, Goodnight Star,Joy Electric,Children of the Inquisition,and more. Echoing Green's Thief is an awesome elektronik/rock anthem that will get you dancing, Goodnight Star's Blue Skies is full of beautiful synth textures with a sound totally their own. Children of the Inquisiton's Godmoney paints a haunting picture of a retrospective look back at a man's life before a spiritual awakening opens his eyes, vocals are reminiscent of Bauhaus's Peter Murphy with beats that bring to mind Portishead and Tricky laden with Depeche Mode synth arrangements. This Comp bings together many other awesome new artists and is a must for fans of electronik musik. Good Buy!"
3,Good read!,Definitely not my favorite book of the series but it was good. I'm excited to move on to the next book of the Kinncaid series. 8)
4,love the kinncades,"I enjoyed this book . Great story line .there is something for eveyone romance ,mystery, and danger .I would most most certainly recomend this book to someone . i can't wait 4 the next one."
5,One terrific book!,Kudos to Jaycee Clark! Once again she has managed to keep me on the edge of my seat. This book was a real page turner! I have read all 3 Deadly books and can't wait to get to the 4th. You just gotta love that Kincaid family!
4,Deadly Obsession (Kinncaid Brothers),In this 3rd book the storyline was ok. I thought Christian's mother was a piece of crap & she deserved to go to jail for what she let happen to Christian. Her mother didn't even deserved to be called her mother. Christian's stepfather also was a piece of crap & he got what he deserved. I really loved how the Kinncaid family sticks together. The only thing that got on my nerves in this story Christian took to long to tell the Kinncaids the truth.
5,Excellent!!,Loved the book! Excellent descriptions and captivating subjects! Kept me reading the next chapter even though I knew I needed to sleep! Looking forward to the next one!
1,REALLY!!!,"I wanted to like this book but some parts of it were absolutely stupid!! *SPOILER ALERT* The heroine is this book got on my nerves the whole entire book!! She kept secrets from a man she claimed she loved for no reason at all and since she was molested by her stepfather who is a US Congressman why did she not warn the family about him after she saw him at the house where a 8 year old girl lived?!? I wanted to beat her the entire book, her decision making sucked big time and only brought misery on herself and the Kincaid family. Man, this book started off really good but the more I read the more frustrated I became. Nobody is that stupid or that reckless when it comes to their own life. Granted we make mistakes but once you find pictures of yourself in your apartment and you didn't put them there, why wouldn't you change the locks? I like strong female characters as much as I like Alpha male characters but the female in this book took stupidity to another level."
4,I loved it but.....,"I just finished the four books in this series over the weekend and overall I enjoyed them all. I love this couple as much as the others but I agree with the other reviewer in that Christian drove me a little nuts. I understand the basis of her fear and her desire to protect the family she loves BUT this is the 3rd story.... The family's response to the two previous issues should've elminitated most of that fear. I enjoyed their story and the romance of it, I just didn't think Christian behaved quite as I would've expected her to."
3,obsession,The book was mediocre. The story line was okay but that was all. The price was not worth it. I wish I had not wasted my money on it.shelia
3,i liked it but,"I thought this book was good had a good story line and plot, but christian just kept getting on my nerves.Honestly if you are that scared you would ask for help,especially after the first 2 books showed the protective side of the family.Also the bad guy was always going to go after the kinncaid family because they love her and will protect her, so a bit of warning would have been good,especially with the amount of young children in the family.I would recommend buying it because it is a series and they follow on from each other, but you will need patience to read the conversations between christian and braydon."
5,Awesome,I LOVE the Kinncaid series!! They are all a wonderful mixture of romance and mystery and intrigue. Each book gets better and better and better!! These are a must read!
1,Fellows is overrated,"It STRUGGLES with ONE SHEET OF PAPER for god sake! Also, buried in the instruction manual is that it can ONLY WORK FOR 5 MINUTES before it needs a rest, POOR BABY!! It's like you are rooting it on, ""Come on 'lil fellow, you can do it!"" But it can't. I don't know if the model I got was defective or if this brand is just junk. My opinion is STAY AWAY!"
1,Worthless POS!,This shredder blows! It is a worthless POS. I can't believe it actually jams with three pieces of paper. And then it's almost impossible to get it to go in reverse. You end up having to rip the paper out by hand and then feed it through one piece at a time. I will never buy another Fellowes shredder! :-/
1,too weak to be usable.,"This product is a sham.Mine broke, as in destroyed, on 4th use. I simply fed it too many sheets. I would think that would jam it, not destroy it. the plastic drive gears shredded instead of the paper."
1,Powerless Shreddrer,"I ordered this shreddrer sometime last month and just pulled it out today to use - I was so excited. According to Consumer Reports this is one of the Top 3 Shreddrers. I put 1-2 pieces of paper to shred and it jams. I have spent about an hour trying to remove the jammed paper which it seems most of it is gone, but it still won't shred. Thank God I have another shredder that I've had for years which wasn't even listed by Consumers Reports - sometimes you have to go with the no name brands. I do not reccommend this product!!"
1,Don't waste your Money.,"I'm looking for a new shedder and I have to vent about this one. I got mine at office depot and lost receipt. When cleaning it, sheds land up everywhere. You can't see how full it is and it is possible for the shreds to feed back up into the shedder. It is supposed to take a credit card and jammed up. It died. Waste of money."
2,Disappointed!,"Shoes were way too dark bronze in color, more like brown. I wanted a bronze which elongates the leg, but was sorely disappointed, ad well as with the BCBGirls I purchased."
2,If this is ravioli then I am donald trump,"ECCH, the only reason this product gets 2 stars is because it is kosher, easy to make, stores easily, was cheap, and is a cute concept. Aside from that the ravioli is disgusting, the filling is a mystery, the sauce is sweet and gross and your likely to see this food in one form or another shortly after digestion.Bottom line... La Briute go back to the drawing board because this one was a miss"
3,It does what it has to do,"It isn't tasty, but it is a quick meal that is triple wrapped, so it'll be kosher even if you heat it up in an unkosher microwave. It is good enough for when you just can't put anything else together. I wouldn't want to have to eat them every night, but once in a while it is tolerable."
5,No wonder it's a best seller. And it's in stock at...,"I used to frequent the chats Jes hosted when she was working for America Online's Online Psychology dept. and I was so excited to find out she took some of her column and published it for a broader audience. She's added some newer material although it was published in 1999 but I imagine she's getting a new book ready as I type this. She's that kind of go getter and it shows through in her work and her book. She's an eclectic soul indeed and the book shares multi-facets of not just her work but of others she cares about. In other words, this book has something for everyone and I still read the beautiful poetry every morning over my coffee. The articles from her colleagues are as relevent today as they were when the book was published and I recommend you get a copy to see for yourself. I do recommend you order it through ..."
3,"slow start,good finish","Really liked 'I will walk like a crazy horse'.This one is more tame.Something you can watch without your girlfriend leaving the room.Not as far out as I expected,but still ok."
1,Celestial Synthesizer,"Despite the album name, this product contains no harp music. It is all played on synthesizer. The product name and description - even the picture of the harp on the cover - aren't accurate; this is ""harp-style keyboard music"", *not* harp music. I wish there were written information in the product description to reflect this; unfortunately, due to a technical issue, I wasn't able to hear the audio samples before I ordered this album.The addition of synthesized pseudo-human voices on every track does not improve the quality of this product.For those interested in Christmas music actually played on the harp, I would highly recommendOn Christmas MornorMidnight Clear."
2,Given 3 stars ONLY for it does work,"This item goes off all the time with no barking! my dog is a freaking mess now, I didnt realize it went off here and there without barking. horrible, I didnt realize it until I put the setting where I could hear when it went off. One upside, now my dog isnt barking as much, just with it in view, LOL.This would go off when my 3yr old would laugh, when we would shut a door, flush a toilet, walk heavily, and our dog was shaking all the time!"
1,not to good,"it didn't stop some of the dogs from going nuts when some one comes to the door , but my little silver girl just runs and hides so I don't use it ."
1,This doesn't work!!,"We have a Pomeranian, he barks exactly the same with Bark Solver or without it. Totally waste of money."
5,Great for small dogs!,"I have four small dogs, three poodles (and we all know how much they bark) and a yorkie. They were driving me crazy, barking at anything that moved outside. I bought this years ago and forgot I had it, brought it out today and wonders of wonders, my dogs stopped barking! I have it on low and audible, just to make sure it isn't going off with other noises. I purposely rang the doorbell, just to see if it would deter them, it does! Would buy again and again, love it!"
1,Disappointed,"I had high hopes. I looked at reviews for the product on Amazon as well as some other places and all signs pointed to yes. I purchased the product and installed it and it failed to even register my dog's barking once. Even from a foot away with it at my dog's exact height it did not work for me. Even if it had work it does not work to put it outside which is where I needed it the most. It must be plugged into an indoor outlet which means running a cord through a window somewhere and hoping that there are no electrical problems during rain. And the vinyl protective cover is really just a nuisance. Like I said, I had high hopes and a positive outlook. 0 stars though."
3,"It works, but I don't like it","We tried the Bark Solver for a couple of days -- in response to the tone from the device, the dogs stopped barking immediately, and looked bewildered. Occasionally they would start to bark again, hear the tone, and stop barking.But we didn't like the effect on the dogs. They started to avoid the living room (where the bark solver was), even though it had been their favorite place to hang out. They still barked occasionally in other rooms. What they learned isn't that they shouldn't bark -- but rather that they shouldn't be in the living room at all.I guess I'd say the solution is a bit heavy handed, because though it works, I didn't like the result. The dogs didn't distinguish between not barking, and not being welcome in the living room. They stopped going there at all."
4,Works Great,"I love this product. I love it;my dog hates it! I live in an apartment, so it only works in the room that he is in, but that is fine. It keeps him quiet when and where he needs to be quiet. The great thing is that when it is not turned on, he still thinks it is on and won't bark.I love it and have recommended it to several people."
1,Stop that barking!,I read all the reviews about this and was excited to try it. I have two stubborn Cocker Spaniels who love to hear themselves speak. This has high ratings but did not work on my girls. They did not seem to mind the ultrasonic sounds and totally ignored it. A fiend brought her black lab over to visit and it totally freaked him out. He was aware of it and wanted it to stop immediately. I sent it back but I think it is worth a try if you are sick of the noise.
1,VERY disappointing results,"2 doxies... very cute but very barky dogs. Turned this on and set it and well, the dogs barked at it and didn't quit. I had such HIGH hopes for it. We gave it a few days too and nothing. No improvement. Darn. Returned it. Doesn't work for every dog I guess."
5,wonderful fun,"this video,which i purchased for me and my grandaughters to watch is delightful it's just the right length and the content is appropriate for little ones(4 and 3)"
5,gift,I bought this for my mom. She liked Shirley Temple & kind of resembled her as a kid. She enjoyed listening to the songs.
5,as specified-no problem,"my daughter grew up watchting this video and she wanted to share it with her 2 year old - and I erroneously assumed it was a dvd, we no longer have a vhs player & am looking for a place to do conversion??? any suggestions?"
4,"CUTE movie, catchy songs","Love this video! A bit outdated, but worth the $5.00 I paid for the old VHS. Why isn't this on DVD by now!?!"
3,Fine. But not large enough for large outdoor cans.,"What can one really say about clear plastic bags - that's what they are. I use them for recycling. I had hoped I could use them in large outdoor garbage cans, but they are more kitchen sized. What I ended up using them for was in my paper shredder. I line the can of the shredder with them and it makes clean up very easy and out to the curb on recycling day it goes."
4,Research Notes regarding the path & How Well the Author was able to keep my attention.,"Unfortunately, I have not had the opportunity to finnish the read, after which I may submit a review. Please, bare with me Ms. Jones.With Utmost Respect,Dana Gerfen"
5,It will change your life!,"This is a fantastic book! Laura Beth Jones takes you by the hand and carefully walks you right to your mission. If you have any confusion about your gifts or your purpose in life, you should read this book."
4,"A soulful, non-intimidating approach to mission statements","I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Working in an organization that helps people feel good about who they are and the work that they do - this book really hit home. The exercises were easy to understand and complete on my own. The book was concise and got to the point.The stories made it easy to relate to. There are several biblical stories and references which I usually tend to shy away friend, but found that a lot of times, they were used because they illustrated a point perfectly.Anyone interested in developing mission statements, personal or professional, can use this book as a great tool."
2,jargon generator for mission statements,"Strip away the biblical quotes and misapplications, the Clintonesque chants to the moon and earth, ""I sense your pain"", (I kid you not--pg 24 and 25!) the early references to Stephen Covey's books, and we are left with a jargon generator for creating a mission statement. (choose a word from column one, a word from column 2, and a word from column 3, put them together, and voila!--mission statement. At the rate Laurie Beth Jones quotes the bible, she will qualify for Televangelist in no time. My suggestion? Get a copy of ""Think and Grow Rich"", or ""Grow Rich! With Peace of Mind"" by Napoleon Hill and concentrate on a definite chief aim. I prefer authors who can keep their god between the lines."
2,The Path,"I bought this book in hopes of getting insight into the revision of our company's mission statement. I was extreemly disapointed. The book is an antidotal series of mostly spiritual advise with little validation for much of the teachings.While this may be quite helpful for individuals seeking a spiritual focus, I found almost no value in the book to help creat or revise a business mission statement for a non-profit company."
1,A Really Ding-A-Ling Book.,"This author labors under the false hypothesis that everyone should have a mission statement in life, but that mission statement shouldn't be any longer or more involved than one simple sentence.It made me wonder how some people get book deals."
1,Christian or Wicca Methods?,"While the author's message is appealing to the reader, my concern is that the ""cornerstone"" of Wicca (witches) is based on the 4 earth elements described in this book. Ms Jones tells her readers to identify themselves as either water, fire, earth or wind. The daily ""poem"" the reader is told to meditate on, is to my understanding, the same technique witches use. The Bible clearly states ""who"" we are in Christ, and as Christians, we are told to ""meditate"" on Him and His Word. If you are a Christian, then take note that the author is using techniques that do not line up with the Bible. While she uses scripture as reference, the reader should know there is another side to her teaching. There is a book by Currot, a Wicca witch, in which the above techniques are also found. Check it out for yourself, then decide if this is the method you should use to define yourself & your mission statement."
4,Great for Beginners,"This book has proved helpful in creating my first home page. Although the book talks mainly about how to use the software, there is a breif bit on HTML and where to host and advertise your page. The software included, (Claris Home Page Lite 2.0) is very easy to use, and good for beginners. If your looking to get your feet wet, I'd recommend this book."
1,"The most boring, dry read I have ever encountered.","This book greatly disappointed me. The book does include a CD with a web page design program on it. That would have proven useful had I opened it. I read the book through, first, and was not able to keep awake. I have found that the book serves me only one good purpose; a drink coaster for my computer desk."
2,Full of lightweight examples and anecdotes.,"This book is full of lightweight examples of road rage and similar types of circumstances requiring a ""forgiveness"" approach in order to move forward without negative affects. There are a few stories about more difficult situations requiring forgiveness, but the book is minimally helpful in terms of dealing with really difficult issues. I generally get a lot from self-help type books because they are full of examples and instructions that necessitate a lot of self-reflection. This book totally fails in that regard. I am not a irrational/rage type person who needs help dealing with multiple minor situations. I already ask myself whether my response to situations is helpful or harmful before deciding what to do or say. I am just in a really difficult situation and would like to find a peaceful and forgiving approach. This book was not helpful at all to my situation. I will try some other ""forgiveness"" books and will hopefully find something that clicks."
4,I love this author,"there was the best story I have ever heard about a cab driver in this book, who came from a family of twenty seven then became a cop and then a cab driver and was given the blessing of forgiving immediatedly so as not to poison his own soul. Am I leaving out something? Ya, that is because it was one of the most touching stories of turning the other cheek I have ever read."
5,Excellent!!,"This CD has the finest recordings of classic concerts titled ""Romance"". The Orchestra and conductor, I&#12288;would dare to say, are just at their best time in their music career when recorded. It is just soooo lively romantic!!!! It is such a disappointment that the producer of this CD has ceased production any more."
1,EP-P toner cartridge for the Canon LBP-430,The toner cartridge cartridge was for the Canon LBP 430. The one I received was another one. I sent it back to asprings83 for a refund. I never received the refund although I have a receipt that says she received the cartridge.Tom Oren
5,Thumbs up for obsolete printer replacement cartridge,"We were pleased with the availability of this Canon Office Products EP-P Toner Cartridge for the LBP-430 and 430/460/465. Since our Canon LBP430 printer is over ten years old we thought we would have to invest in a new laser printer but not so, thank-you."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Humans have peaceful, if ineffectual trade relations with the alien humanoid race on Lisle. They know next to nothing about their biology, a closely guarded secret.This all changes when a human falls in love with one of their women, and finds out that their evolution and reproduction has a great cost.A reasonable, short, and dark toned book."
5,Exactly What I Needed,"A little hard to follow at times, but the many nuggets of wisdom make it well worth the momentary confusion. Has many sections in which to choose from that have specific messages, so it easy to find a little guidance concerning a particular spiritual quandary. There is a lot to be gained from this collection, and patience is key when listening. Also, don't try to absorb any of it unless you can dedicate a little time to give it your full uninterrupted attention, I do not use the words ""hard to follow"" lightly."
2,boring!,Foreign film w/ subtitles. it captures yor attention for a while but doesn't deliver. the end seems to come without a climactic end. on the whole 2$ isnt bad to waste an hour an a half but i wouldn't watch it again for free.
5,"Very similar to Financial Warnings, more indepth","This book is very similar to the previous book (Financial Warnings) by both authors. It is more indepth than its previous predesessor. I find the Financial Warnings to be better because it has more examples. (May be since I know the content of the previous book, this is like redundant.) Anyway, I would recommend you to buy this book."
5,One of the most haunting novels of all time.,"A group of school girls in the Austrialian outback at the turn of the century go out for a picnic and from there a haunting mystery ensues. Joan Lindsay has written a short but involving, absorbing novel that brings to life a strange and memorable experience from a time long ago. Carefully crafted, this novel as well as Peter Weir's direction of the full-length motion picture by the same name present one of the most fascinating interplays between the written form and motion picture format. Much of actual dialogue for the movie is taken from the novel which is almost unheard of nowadays. (For those unable to obtain a copy of the book, the movie version is as well done as the book). Both are delightful as they are haunting."
2,Picninc at Hanging Rock -Fact or Fiction,"I read this book and was fasinated. I saw the movie and wondered why they left out the final correspondence which seemed to be pivital to the death of the head mistress. After further investigation, even though the forward leads you to beleive that this was a real incident, this did not happen nor did anything like this happen. Even the begining of the movie suggests that this book was based on real events. Sort of disappointing. However it is a quick and worthwhile read."
4,Suspense and mystery in the Outback,The book like the film is mostly one of setting and mood. People disappear and people die. Strange coincidences or supernatural influences? Interpretation is left up to the reader / viewer.
3,Australian SF Reader,"A group of schoolgirls and a teacher go on an outing, a few of the girls go off exploring.Not the most exciting book, but an interesting twist at the end that will leave you wondering what has actually happened."
2,Too much description and bordeom.,"This book has way too much description and it doesn't leave the reader to imagine anything for themselves.The mistery is not too bad but the story line is not capturing at all. The story could of been made much better, pity it wasn't."
2,Nothing Special,"The book has only truly acheived fame due to Peter Weir's beautiful film (1975). It is Lindsay's only piece of fiction work (nothing in it is true), and we should be thankful. Her story is haphazard, inconclusive and without any meaning. Her 'extra' chapter, which has a punt at explaining the disappearances, is ridiculous and disappointing. She is, however, able to emulate the style of writing fairly successfully,and creates some kind of interaction between characters. Not a must read, more of a i'm-very-bored-and-there's-nothing-else-to read."
3,Good Read!,"After seeing the play, ""Picnic at Hanging Rock, reading the book was great - a lot more info than in the play. Good story.JB"
3,Not a good value,"The good: takes and holds a keen edge, comfortable handle, looks good.The bad: edge rusts if not wiped off promptly after use. Blade gets thicker from tip to handle and from cutting edge to top, making it difficult to make uniform cuts.Although more often than not I reach for this knife as a default, rather than my Victorinox chef's knife ($27) or santoku ($29), it isn't clearly my favorite."
2,1 'Pro'....Many 'Cons'.....,"Pro: The raised handle allows firmer cleaving.Con: First of all, this is NOT a 'chef's' knife. Chef's knives have a rounded blade that allows the chef to rock the knife as it is used. This one is along the lines of the Santoku and is more cleaver-like.Stainless steel will eventually dull (Remember those cheapo 'Never Needs Sharpening' knives?) and will have to be professionally resharpened.The country of origin, although not mentioned (Japan is hinted at.), is likely China where virtually all the Calphalon cookware and knives are produced.Do yourselves a favor, spend a little more and get a real chef's knife from Wusthof or Henckels."
5,As good as my Schaaf knives,"I bought this to replace a damaged Eberhard Schaaf Goldhamster knife, thinking that the replacement would be ""just OK"". The Katana is fantastic! Super-sharp out of the box, nicely balanced, with a wide bolster to easy the pressure on my forefinger when I have to apply a lot of pressure. Looks good, if a bit ""different"" next to my collection of classic Schaaf knives. However, I'm probably going to buy more of these over time, so it'l look less strange.18 months later, I am still in love with it. The knife feels like a natural extension of my hand, and is super-comfortable. The blade does;t seem to stay sharp for as long as the Schaaf knives, but maybe that's because I use it far more. Five minutes with a Spyderco Sharpmaker and you could shave with it, so no big deal.If it doesn't hold up for the next 20 years, I'm going to buy another."
2,Edge Prone to Cracking,"This has happened twice to us with these knives. The first one, I sent back under warranty. The second time, I think I'll just stop using the knife. The thin inner layer is prone to cracking if the blade gets just the smallest chip. With other knives, you can sharpen these chips out, with the Katana, it forms a crack the goes all the way up to the layered cladding. I think the materials design, at least in the 8"" Chef's knife, is lacking. We aren't cutting nails here, either. If you have one of these knives, be very careful not to allow it to bump up on anything else in the sink or dish drainer. In Calpalon's defense, we have several other kinves in this line and the 8"" Chef's knife is the only one that exhibits this tendency."
5,the cutting edge,"Fantastic, it looks great and cuts even better. Nicely balanced for high speed cutting but works in amateur hands as well. The price is outstanding."
5,"If you only own one trumpet CD, make it this one","This CD has the familiar Haydn trumpet concerto, and the slightly less-familiar Hummel concerto, as well as two little-known works. They are all played brilliantly (in all senses of the word) by Hakan Hardenberger, accompanied by the inimitable Sir Neville Marriner. Every other version sounds wrong once you've heard this one!"
3,An airplane trip to the inner self,"""Valparaiso"" is a play by Don DeLillo. According to the book's copyright page, the play was first performed in 1999 at the American Repertory Theatre in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The play tells the story of Michael Majeski, a man who has attained celebrity status after an unusual journey: his business flight to Valparaiso, Indiana had become an unexpected odyssey that was both strange and ridiculous.I read ""Valparaiso"" as a sometimes dark satire on television and the culture of instant celebrity. Majeski's story is also a reflection on individuality and free will (or the seeming lack thereof in the modern world). This is a surreal piece that is not, in my opinion, wholly effective, but nonetheless contains some sections with both real bite and pathos."
3,DeLillo's trip to media-purgatory,"'Valparaiso', DeLillo's latest drama, is a poignant, cynical decension into the dephts and trivia of talk show-crazy America. Michael Majewski experiences his five minutes of news stardom as he gets involved in a media frenzy for having involuntarily travelled to Valparaiso Chile, while originally starting off for Valparaiso, Indiana. Being questioned about his motives for undertaking this journey and succesively yielding to the reporters' every attempt of utter exposure, his marriage and finally his very existence come under scrutiny. In the end we see all of this coming to an absurd showdown on a TV talk show, proving that to be 'real' has come to mean 'to be watched' - and vice versa. In this skillfully arranged piece, DeLillo has accomplished to create an uptempo, modern drama: humorous, brilliantly written and relaxed as it befits the genre, yet not quite as daring and ingenious as the novelist DeLillo has time and again proven to be."
2,a blatantly obvious satire,"Writing satire is fun and easy. As long as your work is satirical, you don't need real dialogue, well-formed characters, or an interesting plotline. Delillo satirizes the media, so he is allowed to get away with laughable dialogue and characters with one dimension (at best). I agree with another reviewer who said that Chuck Pahlaniuk's Survivor was superior to Valparaiso. Survivor, which also satirizes the role of the media in today's culture, is funnier, more inventive, and a much better read. Please do yourself a favor and skip this play. The only bright spot to reading it will be that while it will waste your time, due to its short length it will not waste too much of it."
1,My review may be longer than the play itself.,"I poured milk on my cereal as I began Valparaiso. My cereal was still crispy when I finished the final words of this all too short piece. Is it a testament to how short our spans of attention have become? I have never before felt ripped off in purchasing a book.Perhaps Simon &Co should have insisted that this be published in a format such as short plays of..., or plays to be read while you are on hold with the airlines."
1,Don't ASSUME anything... Don't Trust Amazon's Description,"I have an older remington shaver that I liked, and wanted to get another one for an upcoming international trip. The Amazon product description says it is cord/cordless and accepts worldwide voltage. WRONG! The MS-5200 does, but the MS-5100 doesn't. The 4 differences are: 5100 won't operate as a corded shaver if the battery is low, 5100 only accepts 110 voltage, 5200 has an extra battery meter, and 5200 has 5 extra minutes of battery life in reserve. I thought it was my fault for not paying close enough attention, but after re-reading the amazon description, I'm sending it back."
2,Would NOT recommend,Doesn't shave well unless hair is very short. Very disappointed as this was a gift for my husband.
5,shaver,"With a couple of short-term exceptions, I have used Remington shavers all my life. This is one of the best, and I am very happy with it."
4,Loud but powerful,"This is far better than my old $25 Braun set, but it is still not perfect. The Remington is loud and heavy, and you often have to use the long hair extension to get the job done, although you do get the job done to perfection every time without any help from a traditional blade."
3,"Decent at first, then not so much...","I got mine about 4 years ago, and for the first 3 it was fine. Not real close, but good enough. I hate the fact that you cannot shave corded. I learned that the hard way as I was on a business trip...anyway, after about 3 years, the sideburn cutter would not stay down! I have to keep my thumb on it so that I can shave. If you shave everyday, then the ""result"" is probably acceptable, however, if you don't then it is more difficult as it does not shave all the hairs, so it takes longer - but I think that is the case with most shaver. I got this on clearance at Target for less than $50, so I guess you get what you pay for."
3,Battery Does Not Last,"This is the second one of these razors I have owned and I like the way it shaves, less bumps. The only problem was that after the 30 days were over the battery didnt hold a charge past 3 uses. (3 Days)"
2,Are Better Shavers Out There,"First two models sent to me would not hold a charge. Finally on the third replacement it worked although like mentioned else where very loudly. It gives a close shave *only* if done every day. If you miss a day and your hair grows fast will take you awhile because you will have to keep going over your face to get missed whiskers. Mini foil pretty much useless. Also 8 months after purchasing the trimmer constantly pops up while shaving and will rarely stay down. Will not be replacing (expensive) foils, rather just look for a new shaver."
2,Great condition and Quick delivery,The shaver sucks doesnt cut anything. Dont use it anymore cause it just doesnt do the job period!
1,john,battery is poor and won't hold a charge for more that 2 days.it is suppose to last a week or more
2,Does not hold battery charge,"The shaver gives a good shave but after 2 weeks of use, the red charge light would come on after about 2-3 shaves and had to recharge it...I called Remington and they were very good about the problem and said they are sending me a new razor immediately........Very good customer service"
3,A good first razor,"I got this as my first razor about two years ago, and I do think it's a good first razor. But I have a few critiques:The razor cuts a few hairs every other pass. This problem existed to some degrees when I first got it, but is even worse now that two years have passed. It's not too durable.The razor is too easy to turn on. I took the Titanium 5100 with me on a trip, but apparently luggage had shifted around in the car and pushed the on button. The battery was dead when I got there. There isn't really a way to prevent this from happening.It's not clear if it's done charging. I can plug it in and I will always get the same indicator regardless of whether the razor is fully charged or not charged at all.It's a little noisy.It's a fair first razor, but I wouldn't trust it as anything more than that."
1,Quality has really dropped,"I have used this same line of shavers for over 30 years and I was always very happy with them. I bought this to replace the prior model, that began to fall apart and was much poorer quality than previous versions. This one is a major step down. These razors were always loud and missed whiskers, but they gave a close shave and they were convenient. This one is really loud, loud enough to wake up family members sleeping on another floor of the house. Also, this particular one only works on the battery, not when plugged in with the cord. It still gives a close but much less comfortable shave, worse than a blade. It is also suppose to be washable but when I ran the heads under the tap the whole housing leaked water from the cracks. It still ran but I worry about safety and durability. As a loyal customer for a very long time I am really disappointed."
4,Remington MS-5100 Titanium MicroScreens 700 Rechargeable Shaver,Love it all except for the fact that the shaver has to remain in the recharger bin when not in use.
3,liquid karma,this product is ok. not sure if it really made the plants taste better though.probably would not buy again
5,Beautiful!,"If it's the last thing I do, I'm going to that Auberge! (if only it were still there) The way he describes his first steps into the hidden valley, sound like the opening to The Sound of Music ... I read this book with growing love and fascination. It inspired me to study cooking at the French Culinary Institute. I haven't tried these specific recipes yet, though they sound like French classics. Thank you, thank you, for telling this story."
5,Very informative reading and cooking book,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book it gave me inspiration, this is a ""slow food"" book. I love the story on Chartreause, and the pairing of food and wine"
3,French Cuisine reveals Barbaric side,"Yes, De Groot weaves a beautiful image of the countryside, the premise of locating the origin of Chartreause is intriguing as well. However, nothing has pushed me, a fifty year veteran of red meat consumer, over the edge to turn vegetarian as this book has.In all fairness, let me admit I have not been able to get past the 100th page. (How could I?) The first fifty have been full of pigs feet, tripe, etc. The clincher, however, came when there is a passage about how the Christmas terrine was 'saved'. Apparently the Nazi occupation put a damper on the villagers provisions, one of them being the supply of veal, (very important when one is face to face with a fascist regime)...but, alas, nothing was more important than having a 'duck and veal' terrine at Christmas time. The salvation was in the form of a pregnant cow being marched into the village in the early days of December...you do the calculation. Steak, anyone?"
4,Attractive Outdoor Clock,"I bought this to match my Rumford Copper Thermometer. This stays on the patio during the warm weather and is tucked away before winter. It keeps accurate time, is large enough to see the numbers, and is well made. Over time it has oxidized and now has a wonderful patina. I have had absolutely no problem with either the clock or the thermometer. Both were well worth the modest price paid."
2,"Respectful author, frustrating reading and viewing...","The author of this book loves and respects Indian Rock Art, and it shows in her writing.The fact that little is known about what the drawings mean and who made them makes for frustrating reading, however.The photographs are very dark and hardly anything shows up in them. Probably to save money, a lot of the art examples are sketches, and very scribbly ones at that, so if you are looking for good visuals, do not buy this book."
1,disappointed,"I really like ""The Artists Way"" program, and struggle to incorporate it into my life. I thought this would be a daily calendar of suggestions and inspiration for incorporating the artist way philosophy into my daily life. Instead it focuses on the concept of the ""Artist Date"" in a cartoonish trivial way. I realize now that I should have been prepared for it not to be a calendar, but I found it very disappointing and not up to the quality I expected from having read the original book. I will try to return it to Amazon, something I rarely (if ever) do."
3,Riddled with self-promotion,"This could have been a great guide --- except for the proliferation of ""trade-marked"" catch words. Every TM that I encountered was another irritant and reading interruption. I was also put off by some of the outdated data. Nonetheless, there are many luseful checklists and resource lists (which I hope will prove current). This inexpensive book is worth the price for those alone. I also bought ""Angel Investing"" by Mark Van Osnabrugge, which I found more credible and pleasant to read."
2,Too Much Fluff - No Content,"I have read many books on financing and founded my own tech company securing funding from angels, VCs, and investment banks. This book was non-practical and filled with too much marketing fluff with page after page of trademarked terms that made no sense whatsoever. I know for a fact that if any of my VCs read this book they would literally laugh. It was like Tim Robbins trying to write about venture capital. The bottom line is that investors don't give you money based on what you say but rather what you do -- walk the walk."
2,Don't bother.,"Mark H. Long might have a few interesting things to get across to his readers; but by reading this book, you would hardly know it. This poorly written book stumbles through numerous forgettable acronyms, some ""new age"" economic research and trademarked ""methods"" for raising venture capital. Spare me. It takes 354 pages to get across what should have been written in 40-50 pages. Combine David Letterman's top 10 lists with Stephen Covey and George Soros and you end up with this forgettable book. I found High Tech Start Up : The Complete Handbook for Creating Successful New High Tech Companies by John L. Nesheim much better. His research and writing method is far superior."
1,"Low quality, confusing information","if you have any idea what you are doing, then this book is just a scrapbook of low-quality materials. if you don't what you are doing, then look elsewhere, this book will only confuse you."
5,Guaranteed Success,"Mark Long has completed over 700 successful securities offerings. In this phenomenal book he reveals his 10 step process for raising money for your new venture without credit or collateral. Mark's approach is practically guaranteed to get you the money you want because of his strategic approach and in-depth analysis of your options. Rather than just focusing on raising money, Mark starts off by explaining what it really takes to create a pheonomenal business. By designing success into your business plan, you can attract capital rather than chase it. .Mark's approach is radically different than the traditional way entrepreneurs try to raise money. He explains a systematic and methodical process that has proven to be wildly successful for his clients. You won't find a more practical guide for developing and refining your step-by-step money raising process"
1,Pure garbage.,"I tried using this POS and the bandwidth to load this webpage is worth more than this gun. Absolutely useless, the spray is so minimal and sporadic its not even funny. The wrench included does not work on all the pieces, most of which are so overtightened you will never get them loose to clean them. The regulator is a plastic piece of garbage. Not worth a penny."
4,enjoyable read,"A Day in a Medieval City is an interesting and unusual book. Many history books feature illustrations, but A Day in a Medieval City weaves the illustrations and writing together to really give a vivid picture of life in a medieval city. This is a charming book."
3,Works.,Purchased at AMAZON. Works but overpriced like all Sony Products. There is no way to find that that the cleaner has outlived its life.
1,head cleaner is no cleaner,"Buying the Sony 8mm head cleaner was a complete waste of money. It might have worked if it was like my other video head cleaners that include liquid solution along with an abrasive fabric tape to do the work. The tape in the head cleaner appeared to be no different then a standard 8mm tape, and thus did absolutely nothing in cleaning my video camera heads. I repeated the process several times, with no better results. I would not buy this product again."
1,Sony 8mm Head Cleaner V8-25CLD,The Sony 8mm Head Cleaner was a waste of money! $35 down the drain! Ended up buying a used camera to see my videos for over $100!
3,sony head cleaner,This product will clean a video head but don't rewind till you are at the end for maximum life of the head cleaner!
1,Worthless,"Don't buy this. If your picture is fuzzy, take it to a repair shop or buy a new camera. This didn't help clear up our camera's picture at all."
2,Did not help my Sony camcorder issue,"I have an older Sony camcorder that has a snowy picture issue. I figured I tried this first before looking to get it repaired, however, this head cleaner didn't help. Don't know if it's the head cleaner itself or the camcorder needs professional service."
3,The legacy of Moriarty,"When the American inventor of a stereoscopic camera comes to Britain to photograph historical buildings, he is the subject of anonymous threats. Holmes soon recognises one of the lieutenants of the late Professor Moriarty as the hand behind the actions, but how does this tie in with the strange religious ceremonies they encounter?Barrie Roberts turns out a good Holmesian pastiche, but this one misses the mask for me. The storyline ties in with British history, Arthurian legends, sites of historical interest and more. As such, I felt curiously uninvolved - the story proceeded without me finding a strong handle on which I could grab hold.Because the subject matter is outside my areas of knowledge, I can't say how impressive the deductions of Holmes are, and so the story also fails here for me.The depiction of Holmes and Watson seem quite true to their original portrayals.I think the book works fine, but it may be more suitable to readers other than me."
2,"In a word, boring!","Here's yet another Sherlockian pastiche off the presses. I buy 'em all, hoping to come across another Sam Siciliano's Angel of the Opera or another Laurie R. King's The Beekeeper's Apprentice. Or at least a Jan Walker's Singular Case of the Duplicate Holmes, but my advice for you who've arrived to this page and are considering buying this book is ""Keep on going. Nothing to see here."""
5,Lowe Not Low,"Yes, it is a bit pricey. But it's worth every penney. I can't believe I bought a new copy of this hot set for only $50.00 when it was first released. My first exposure to Nick Lowe was on a ""new wave"" segment of a local college radio station. The DJ played Jesus of Cool in its entirety. After hearing it, I bought both Pure Pop For Now People and Jesus of Cool. Repitition - so what, big deal. Even a cool Christ would be hard nailed to create songs like this. It's hard to caterorize Nick - we shouldn't try anyway. This box set is THE DEFINITIVE COLLECTION OF ONE OF OUR TRULY GREAT SONGWRITERS. Nick doesn't have a bad song in him. This box set proves it. I'll just shut up now. Buy it before it disappears. Great, great, great. Sit back, crank up the volume, and enjoy."
1,Not worth the price,"There is very little in this book that is of any interest, and the printing is very low quality. It's just a collection of a few notes printed using a copy machine and spiral bound. If your family name is not explicitly mentioned, then it really isn't worth it. There is nothing original in these notes. You can easily get all this information elsewhere, and in much better quality."
2,Genealogy and Family History in Co. Cavan and Co. Leitrim,"I was very disappointed with this book. After only one year of research, I had already identified most of the information contained here by using various internet sites or other publications readily available in any good library."
5,Co Cavan,"My paternal great grandparents both came to the USA from Co. Cavin, Ireland, I will be ordering more books regarding Co. Cavin,"
1,Avoid this at all costs!,"I love Willie Nelson. To me, he is the ideal country music singer. But as the previous reviewers have stated, the sound quality is simply awful. I love Willie live, don't get me wrong, but I hate lousy sound quality. And that's exactly what this CD offers.If you want to hear some good live Willie Nelson, do yourself a favor and pick up 'Wille And Family Live.' That is an awesome live recording from Willie. It certainly beats this one by a long shot. But stay far away from this one.Not recommended."
3,Dark Kitty,"This plush beanbag toy is durable and made of soft, velvety material with vinyl skeleton markings on the face and forelegs. Despite the ""dead cat"" appearance, this toy does manage to have a cute but mildly dark theme. A perfect gift for cat lovers or those taking a shallow dip into the mildly macabre. While the size isn't meant for cuddling, Kit does make a good travel companion or dashboard/cubicle ornament. The floppy body does allow the user to pose this cat in some positions."
2,"For the money, it's not worth it","For the money, when you pay 14.99 for a beanie, when you believe your getting a plush, (8-9"" tall), you feel like you've been ripped off. I could have gotten the ""beanie"" for 7.99 on another site if I had just done a little more research."
5,Flicka is wonderful!,"This is the debut recording for Frederica von Stade, I think. Since I have watched the wonderful ""La Cenerentola"" with Abbado from DG, I searched for Flicka's Cenerentola. At last I found it! Now I'm very happy to hear it. Her Rossini is very elegant and beautiful. When you hear her Angelina's aria, you may think she is scolded to by her stepfather and stepsister, but she hopes someday she will be happy. She is the Cinderella many people think. Her Cherbino is wonderful and charming, too.Flicka's voice is mellow and charming, beautiful. You will love it. The former reviewer said she lacked the technique to produce a full, satisfying sound. I agreed with it. But when I listen to this album, I always found myself to love it and know I'll hear this album again.Also recommend: French Opera Arias from Sony Classical"
3,A worthwhile yet frustrating book whch almost self-destructs,"This is an odd work indeed. On the positive side, it provides UFO researchers with valuable information on the many WVA sightings, both historical and comtemporary, with first-hand investigations. The negatives, however, are significant: less than tight writing style, inappropriate forays (by the author) into amateurhypnosis of percepients of UFOs, and, most troubling of all, an ending which has seemingly no connection with the rest of the book, whereby Mr. Teets goes on a tirade attacking (especially) Dr. John Mack and his work with ""abductees"" ,a subject not mentioned in the body of the work.As if this was not bad enough, Mr. Teets' leaves us with this pearl of wisdom...to ""pray"""
1,bak solver X40,"Dont waste your money on this. You can only return it if its unused. Well, how do you know if it works or not if you dont try it. The dogs were a little quieter at first but now they are used to it and they don't notice it at all. I've only hade it one week. It goes off with every sound so the dogs dont relate it to there barking. So Im back to square one. Its realy not my place to train the neighbors dogs. I just want them to STOP BARKING.Big wast of my money!!!!"
2,Didn't work for us...,"Hmmm....this device seemed to help a tiny bit with our German Shepherd, but made our Pug bark ten times more than usual. Our German Shepherd would start to bark and sleek away, but then our Pug would go ballistic and cause our Shepherd to bark. Another thing is we do not have a perfectly square or circle backyard, so when my dogs would bark on the side of the house, down our 100ft. RV path, the Bark Solver could not reach. I tried moving it about my backyard, but it could not cover the entire yard (which isn't really that big). We would need 2-3 Bark Solvers angled in different directions. This just did not work for us. Good idea, and may work for someone with a smaller yard and hopefully it will not make your dog worse."
2,This is my 3rd type - it better work!,"This is my third barker, the last ones could be used in a nursing home and not bother anyone from their nap. Crappy!Will report when I get it.Taos Guy"
5,Give it a try!,"This is a recording on period instruments, which I am never a fan of. Instruments of this period had a lot of problems with intonation and they can be quite difficult to play. Thus, a lot of the recordings one hears with this variety of instrument can be substandard. And me, I personally like the sound of a full modern orchestra, even for the Mozart Requiem. I purchased the Abbado recording with the Berlin Philharmonic as well, but I'll have to say I prefer the Gardiner. His tempos are brisk, especially in the Dies Irae, which I really like. And it sounds really good. What more can I say?So for those naysayers, give this a try. I don't think you will be disappointed."
5,No wobbly vibratos (thank goodness),"An avid Mozart listener, I find the modern renditions of his breathtaking music most often too heavy handed, with too much sound too much of the time. In this more traditional recording, we rediscover the lightness and clarity of sound that Mozart is known for. Thank goodness--no more Verdi-esque performances by artists who believe they are singing the dramatic Romantic solos instead of the more precise Classical solo. The clarity of tone and the beautiful singing are what draws me, the classical singer, again and again to this gorgeous piece, finally rendered by singers with precise pitch. The CD remains fitting homage to a brilliant composer and without a doubt one of the jewels in my collection."
5,Insects of planet Earth!,"This book has all the insects of the world! Here in Africa we have many insects so I like to know which kind are what by looking at this book. I want to be an entomologist when I grow up, so this book gave me a step ahead from beginning to learn entomology. The pictures are excellent positions to capture the texture of the insect. This is the book you wantto know what kind of insects those are you see every day!"
5,This Book was Great!,"This story is a sad one about a girl named Claire who's friend killed herself. Claire's friend Hannah was really a hero. Like a 7-11 of friends, open 24 hours a day. Catering to everyone's need. Her mother killed herself and she never had a love life. Claire's life falls apart; her mother becomes pregnant with someone she is not married with. She then falls in love with her friends boyfriend brining guilt. It was so touching."
4,"Good Stethoscope, BP Cuff is Meh","The title basically says it all. Poor nursing student here. If I had it to do over again, I'd have just bought the stethoscope, which is great, and skipped the blood pressure cuff, etc. School supplied a BP cuff that is slightly more comfortable for the patient - softer, less crunchy material. I am very happy with the stethoscope, however, and am sure it will get me through nursing school just fine if I can manage to avoid losing it."
4,"Great Stethoscope, Bad BP Cuff","I ordered this for my nursing clinicals. I was really excited to get it, however, when it came to take my Mandatory lab practice, this blood pressure cuff didn't work. I suggest that you buy the stethoscope only, and buy the cuff somewhere else."
2,stethoscope pretty crummy,I wish I'd gone to a nursing/medical supply instead of purchasing this product as the stethoscope is not nearly the quality one needs to easily take accurate blood pressures.
4,Excelente Producto,"Muy buen producto, muy completo y es tal cual como lo dice la publicacion.. lo recomiento 100% sigan asi que proximamente les hare una nueva compra"
1,OK BUT NOT GREAT!,IN THEORY THIS SHOULD BE A GREAT IDEA. I GAVE IT TO MY KIDS FOR THEIR PSP AND THEY FOUND THAT IT JUST MADE THE PSP BULKY AND DIDN'T REALLY STAY CLOSED ON THE PSP.
3,not bad,"I've had it for about a week now. The copies come out very good in black and white. the color copies look a bit faded. The print quality is good enough, I printed a couple of photos and they came out ok but not great. The scanner is good for documents but not good at all for photos. Tried the fax once and didn't have any problems. I paid 89.99 including the USB and it does everything i need it to so I'm happy so far."
2,FCC license has nothing to do with range.,"Everyone please understands that getting the FCC license for any GMRS radio does ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to increase the range of the radio. The license is a piece of paper so the FCC may track who is using GMRS frequencies, nothing more. They used to do the same for CB users in the 70's. They do not track FRS freqs because of the low output power of FRS radios. Range is affected by output power of the radio but mostly by obstacles between you and the other radio. Trees, walls, buildings, hills, etc. reduce the range considerably. A true test of range is on open water or unobstructed Line-Of-Sight from one hilltop to another. (Not everyone has a boat) Buy three different sets from different brands and try them near a lake to test, return the ones that are not to your liking."
5,Very Exciting Live Recording,"This is a very exciting performance which is not at all undermined by the fast pace. The sound is excellent with a good balance between voice and orchestra. Occassional audience and stage noices give the recording an added degree of authenticity. I also think Bohm is a far better conductor than Solti, although this is a personal preference."
5,"Richard Wagner: Der Ring des Nibelungen by Gerd Nienstedt, Josef Greindl","Hello, I have been looking for years for this album and finally got this is my Best and Beloved Wagner and this company has it in the BEST shape I give them an A +++++++++++++++++++++++++++I will Buy from them again and SO SHOULD YOU!!!!!!Sincerely,Philip Koban"
5,Unbelievable,I would hate to be without Rysanek's Sieglinde and Nilsson's Brunnhilde. I wish Christa Luwdig had done Fricka and Waltraute here
2,Flawed.,"Only one previous reviewer has mentioned the huge flaw in this recording that prevented me from listening to it with any enjoyment. This is that, unfortunately, you can hear the prompter whispering virtually every line to the singer before it is sung, the prompter becomes part of the performance and that is inexcusable. I can't understand how the producer let this happen, surely they could have recorded a few performances where the prompter wasn't needed. The funny thing is quite a bit of this ring isn't 'live' but was recorded at rehearsals so there is no excuse for the audible prompters. Hopefully in the future they can find a way to remove this part of the soundtrack, if they can then this will go straight into the top 5 recordings of the ring."
3,From Experience...,"I read this book from cover to cover during one of my frequent retreats to the local sweat lodge. After a few too many cans of Kylon Arcylic (gold is my fav!), my resulting state of mind and body will instruct me to take refuge there.I feel that the basic thrust of the book is right on - we basically are a spiritual type of people who, when drinking alcohol, will often take great delight in running our almost new automobiles, bought with our casino revenue, out of gas and oil, only to abondon them by the roadside without so much as a blink.I gotta go get some beer."
2,A great start then progressive decline,"The novel starts out with great promise but loses steam well before its anticlimactic ending. In ""All That Lives . . ."" , the Bell family of a small 1815 Tennessee farming community is haunted by an other worldly force that visits during the night. The force is referred to by many names throughout the novel: The Spirit, The Devil, The Being, The Demon, The Witch. It tortures, taunts, tricks, kills, and rescues. Although the author does a good job of capturing the language and atmosphere of the period, the story lost interest for me when it became apparent that the background story of a vengeful and punishing, yet loving and compassionate God seemed too didactic for the type of fiction I prefer reading. I borrowed this one from the book exchange at my office so nothing lost financially in the experience but the time invested here could well have been better spent elsewhere."
3,What happened to the end of this story?,"I found myself very interested in these characters' story and unable to put this book down through the first half. It seemed to me that whatever point, climax or conclusion that the author may have intended was not communicated sufficiently, or else she just ran out of steam once she reached a certain point in her story. I found myself not caring what happened to the characters and forced myself through the end of it. She was obviously trying to tie the mystery of this manifestation to the abuse of a young girl, though not successfully in my estimation. Aside from the story, one thing that I felt a bit uncomfortable about was, though this is a work of fiction, she allows her readers to believe that a real historical figure was engaged in sexual abuse. I'm sure his living decendents wouldn't appreciate that conclusion."
1,BORING,This book was long winded drawn out and down right boring. I'd suggest this book to anyone suffrering from insomnia. A definite disappointment.
3,"Narration yes, dialog no","The author does a good job of re-creating early America. But be warned: in either a failed attempt at more ""formal"" and old-fashioned speech or the worst case of Tin Ear you've ever read, these characters are made to speak out-landish dialog. No human being in the history of the race ever spoke like these people do. Apart from that, however, it is a good story, well-told though not ""scary."""
1,I should have put it down when I lost interest,"As others have written, this book was quite disappointing after an enjoyable start. One continues reading, hoping that somehow all the loose ends will tie together, but they never do. When the spirit begins to speak aloud the book loses all credibility. I skimmed the last few pages as I was basically disgusted, and not at all spooked. Waste of time and money."
2,"Big Build Up, Lousy Ending","I have never felt so let down by the ending of a book. The author did a great job of creating a mystery that kept me riveted, but then never offered a satisfactory explanation for the puzzling events that took place. By the time I got to the last few pages of the book, I happily anticipated a good ""payoff""---a revelation that would leave me saying ""Wow"" but no such ending was forthcoming. There was no revelation. There was nothing. The author offered a few veiled hints along the way, but they were way too subtle and I was left with many questions that never got answered to my dismay. I felt that I had wasted my time reading this book. My advice is Don't Bother."
1,Dull & Unreadable,"I started this book hoping for a good ghost / witch / supernatural story. It did not happen. This story is boring; the writing is stilted. I was unable to finish the book. I really try to finish the books I start, especially after spending [$$$], but this is one I just couldn't finish. It is not scary despite the author's evident best effort to make it so. It just drones on & on..."
3,All That Lives,"The book was entertaining, but not one that kept me on the edge of my seat. I thought the book was interesting enough to hold my attention but as the end of the book drew to a close, I thought something more exciting would happen."
2,So So Panini Cookbook,The book was a dissapointment. I would not have bought it if I had had a chance to look in it.
4,Batman: Broken City,"Azzarello is great, as in 100 Bullets. This combination: Batman and Azzarello and Riso is ideal for this kind of super hero."
4,The World's Greatest Detective...,"Other reviews didn't like the narrow scope of the story, but I thought it was wonderful. Loeb/Lee has probably been my favorite combination in a long time, but a narrow story without all the glam and glitz of fitting in as many villians and heroes as possible is what's achieved in Broken City. Batman at his darkest, but also Batman doing detective work. If that's what you're interested in, this book's for you."
2,"Really, Not Great, Whatsoever","This novel, literally gave me a headache. While showing glimmers of coherency the writing was generally shoddy, broken and confusing. The artwork was a cheap Sin City imitation, but sloppy and painfully ugly at times. The story was forgettable and included absurd and unnecessary elements to further disinterest the reader. Lots of good Batman graphic novels out there (see my list http://www.amazon.com/World-s-Finest-Batman-Novels-Top-10/lm/RWBST41OFQYP8/ref=cm_lm_byauthor_title_full) this one, isn't even close."
5,Best Jazz Christmas CD Ever!!!,"My dad bought this cd back in 1999 and my entire family has been enjoying it ever since. This is by far the best instrumental smooth jazz christmas cd that I have ever heard. This has become one of our family's favorite christmas cd's right along with Perry Como, Andy Williams, Donny Hathaway, Johnny Mathis and Nat King Cole. The beats are timeless and smooth. If you are a true lover of jazz, this is cd is a must. Once you listen to it, it to will become one of your favorites."
5,Very Impressive for the Price,"I received a very nice USA made drill bit at a bargain price. Runs true, cuts cleanly and looks like it will do the job for a very, very long time. I saved a bundle compared to buying a similar bit at local stores."
2,Not Happy With Product,"This product just did not work well for me. Video head cleaning is not new to me, and I have used many products over the years that have worked much better than this one. In my experience with using this produce I saw little improvement after cleaning and have quit using it.I am sure that different units with different amount of need to be cleaned will produce different results. My recommendation is to pass on this one and get a wet cleaner."
4,Preserving antiquity,"As VCR players become more scarce, the support products are disappearing.. While I prefer the 'wet' tapehead cleaners, this 'dry' version is performing very well, and should extend the useful life of our 'tired' VCR players.. being obsolete is rough!"
1,A waste of time and money,"I should just have taken the VCR in to have it checked. The comment from the repair shop was ""that never fixes the issue"" in response to my mentioning that I bought one of these tapes to fix the problem of distorted picture from my VCR. Most often I guess the heads need to be replaced - and they don't make them anymore. I tossed the VCR in the garbage after paying another $45.00 to have someone tell me they can't fix it."
1,Disney Dream Screen Review,"I was really excited about this item when I ordered it as a gift. When we opened it and attempted to use it, it just skipped in place. It didn't play and advance or anything. I had to return it and did not ask for a replacement because the quality just seemed so poor. Such a disappointment! It looked great online."
4,You will laugh out loud!,"I got this book quite a long time ago but I keep going back to it time after time for a quick laugh. It's very short but it keeps you laughing from the first page to the last. It's full of all those things you wish you could say to all the stupid questions you're faced with every day. By the time you've reached the last page you really wish there were more. If you get frustrated with all the imbecile questions you get asked every day then I guarantee you, you will like this book."
1,Watching paint dry is much more exciting than this book,"I disagree with the last review... There are far too many pages in this book. After about the third page I wondered how books like this get published. After the fifth page I went on a desperate search for my matchbook. I not only want my money back, I want the 9 seconds of my life back that was wasted reading this disgrace to the human race."
2,Hike Mississippi...if you can find the trails.,"This book, while informative, is quite difficult to use. As a fairly experienced hiker, I was excited to use this book to explore my new surroundings. However, much to my disappointment, I found this book to be difficult to use, lacking basic information such as directions to the trail heads, elevation gain, and maps of the actual hikes. Instead, the author provides a series of topographical maps and detailed maps of the overall area (forest, park, etc) which do little to give the reader a real sense of the hike.If I had the opportunity to do things over, I'm not certain I would purchase this book. It's given me hours of headache with little reward."
1,Dads Say The Dumbest Things,The book is not very funny because it's one liners that are taken out of context. Would not recommend the book to anyone.
3,breezy fun,"This light reminiscence of Yogi's ten championship seasons is a quick, pleasant read. Like a fleshed out magazine article, perhaps, it touches on a bit of history, a few sketches of famous teammates, and a recounting of the high spots of this charming hall of famer's career. A good choice for the younger fan with no memory of the game as it was in a simpler time."
4,Awesome !,This disk is really good !It worth the money.Thanks amazon for selling this kind of items hard to find.
5,Aggressive!,"Swapped the stock exhaust for this one on my 03. Very pleased with the results. The sound is aggressive and it does turn heads, but it isn't so loud it is obnoxious. It's has a good solid throaty growl."
1,No longevity,"I don't see any follow-up reviews from the previous comments, so let me add that these will break. They have plastic construction inside and while they may work great for a while, they will break because of the stress on the plastic parts inside the tubing. We really liked the design, but it is built very cheaply inside where it counts."
5,Art & Fear is awesome book,"If you are an artist of any persuasion (ie, a CREATIVE PERSON), Art & Fear sheds a lot of light on what your fears are about and why/how it may stop you from pursuing your passion."
4,a good book for beginners,"I had to read Art and Fear for a photography class I am taking. The idea behind the book is to remind artists that creating art is about you and no one else. Whether people understand or appreciate your art is irrelevant. It's a great book for anyone just starting their art career, but those of us who have already been through the machine a few times will find the information in this book to be more of a reminder of what we deal with everyday. It's a fast read and raises some good points. I'd recommend this book for anyone that thinks they are an artist, or for those who don't think they are good enough to be an artist."
5,"Releasing the ""fear""","There are few books that introduce themselves to the artist these days--this is an exception. With honest and open commentary, Art & Fear gives a sense of placement for every thought, every rationale the artist has ever made to his/herself. Within those placements are sound advice, that leaves one feeling at the very least that there are paths beyond the conventional. This one is must for every artist."
2,This is an article turned into a book,"This book takes some simple ideas and beats you over the head with them over and over again trying to make them seem profound. It reminds of term papers you had to write, that had to be so many pages, so you word it up to fill the requirement. The helpfullness of this book isn't much and can be shortened down to an article. Not worth the money."
2,Waste of your time and money,"High reviews, bad book. I'm pretty sure the author was writing it just to make an easy buck off the sales. Skip it or get from a library."
5,Art and Fear,I needed this over the summer for one of my Art classes.... I enjoyed reading it so much that I passed it along to my Instructor from High School.
5,Fear? What fear? Oh...that fear.,"This is an excellent book, not for only those creating traditional art, but also for writers, musicians, dancers and really anybody in any form of creative expression. The book aptly describes the very real fear of making your work available to the general public. Personally, I have experienced just about every fear discussed in ART and FEAR. It is a great manual for putting those fears in perspective. While this this book may not be extremely helpful for an established artist, writer, etc., it does help to know that we, those of us trying to make our way in the field of making stuff up from nothing, are not alone in this endeavor and that fear and insecurity is a natural part of the process and it can be overcome."
4,Excellent,This is an excellent book. It should be read by amateur and professional artists alike. Why should I have to write five more words?
4,Observations on the Perils and Rewards of Artmaking Books,"Art & Fear is not just useful in the way that all artmaking books are useful. They all tend to get a person going, thinking about art, pointed a little nearer to making art. But Art & Fear is very clear that sitting down and thinking about art isn't going to do the trick, and reading a book about it isn't going to do the trick -- to create good art one must be creating art.The tone of the book is very businesslike, and so sometimes it can be a less than enthralling read, but its information is vitally important. And there's something valuable about a voice that says, ""All right, stop dithering around and get down to the business of doing art.""And I think that in many ways, artists need that. We need discipline as well as inspiration, and we need to be told that we have the tools we need to be artists -- we just have to keep going."
4,Good read,"This is a great read, especially if you're interested in art and it's processes and society's perceptions. Some interesting essays."
5,Couldn't have lived through college with out it,"I really couldn't say enough good things about this book. It's insightful and it gives a very fair out look on what the life of an artist really will be. It's hopeful, but not preachy. On the other hand it shows the downsides to being an artist too. It's very good prep material for anyone looking to further their education in art. Or for those who are deciding what to do with their lives, and have decided on art.And if you've decided to be an artist no matter what, it has quite a bit of useful and practical insight on how to overcome the stop gaps in making art. It teaches you to make art because you like to make art. It offers practical suggestions on how to maintain a successful and enjoyable career as an artist with out dwelling on the many downsides that often come with it....hey! Even an art student could afford it!"
2,Sometimes maddening....,"I got a lot out of the first couple of chapters in this book, but more often than not, I was frustrated with the tone, the flow, and the style of writing. I sometimes stopped and asked myself, ""What is the point they are trying to make?"" It also had a sort of joyless and depressing tone. It was hard for me to finish. The language could have been more simple and flowing....it was a difficult read sometimes, and peppered with thoughts in parentheses.....frustrating. In all, it felt heavy and sad."
2,Disappointing!,"I'm a screenplay writer.Movie director Robert Rodriguez recommended this book in his commentary on DVD. So I bought it.But it was not as good as I expected.If you're confident about you and eager to create something, you don't need this book."
5,So good I bought a spare to loan out.,"This book directly addresses parts of the emotional ""dark side"" of art -- the fear, resistance, perfectionism, and vulnerability that are so commonly felt by artists, but are rarely discussed. Reading this book was a constant stream of ""Oh! I'm not alone in dealing with this!"" moments. I keep a spare copy on hand now, just to loan out to friends."
4,"there is the theory,but...","nice theory,but,when the ""workbook"" will be available???....lots of likely books neglect the same point: a practical application section (or book) is not included.just a nice book."
5,An okay read.,I was really surprised by this book because it came so highly recommended and I wasn't very impressed with the contents.
1,still waiting,"More than one month after I innitially order, it is still weeks away from being delivered!"
3,Book was okay,"For such a giant book, I expected more of a story. The story line is cute but much too short."
5,Tuna salad!,Mo Willems is one of the best writers in children's literature today.My 4 year old daughter loves all of the books.This one is terribly clever and fun for parents and kids alike.
5,love this book - it is one of our favorites,"I have purchased this book for my 3 year old son as well as some friends (children aged 4-10). They all like it - even the 10 year old. The age 6 kids love the part where the bird poops on his head. The girls like it too, and it's especially wonderful when you get to the ""wonderful friend"" part - everyone hugs each other. All kids I've read this to (neighbors, friends, my own) have loved this book and want me to read it over and over."
3,It's all about the tuna salad.,"Mo Willems, Leonardo the Terrible Monster (Hyperion, 2005)I have to admit, I'm a little (but not much) outside the suggested reading range for this book, which according to author Mo Willems is 3 to 36. Alas, I was 37 at the time I read it. I will attempt not to let this affect my judgment in any way.Leonardo is a monster who's incapable of scaring the tuna salad out of anyone. (And if nothing else, the phrase ""I'm going to scare the tuna salad out of him!"" is worth the price of admission here.) This makes him, of course, a terrible monster. Leonardo hatches a plan: find the scardest kid he can and scare him. He finds a possible target, and... well, that's a spoiler.It's a cute little book, nothing earth-shaking (except for the tuna salad line), but a quick bit of fun to read to the kids. Pull a copy out of your local library before laying out the cash to see how your kids take to it, but I think they'll get a kick out of Leonardo. ***"
3,Disappointed,"I thought this was a very nice pump with alot of great features. However the problem I had was that during pumping the milk would start going up the tubing. The manual said that if this happens you must immediately shut off & unplug the pump, wash the tube out and dry completely before using the pump again. Problem - the tube is long and therefore it wouldn't dry out easily. Because of this, I couldn't use the pump & resorted to my Avent manual pump. Manual pumping just wasn't enough for me & I could not maintain my milk supply so unfortunately I ended up going to formula bottle feeding. I was very disappointed. I probably could have gotten an extra tube & used that while the other one dried out, but there should not have been a tube back up problem in the first place. I also wasn't thrilled with the Elan bottles. The nipples were hard to pull through the ring and plus, the bottles leaked a little. It's a shame because this seemed like such a nice pump; maybe mine was just a lemon???"
4,Captured the beauty of Venice,Venice and the Veneto has some very charming pictures of both Venice and the islands and inland surrounding it. The pictures are beautifully taken at various times in the day at different angles. I would recommend this as a coffee table book to whom ever has a love for Venice. I did think though that it would have been even a more delight for me if it had more works on the not so familiar aspects of Venice- such as the trailing tresses of plants or the gardens hidden in stone walls.
3,Enamel not as tough as better known names but cooks well.,"I have been using this pot for a year now and it cooks well, as the cast iron soaks up the heat and it does what I expected. Spaghetti sauce was never so good. But, this is my second as the first chipped almost immediately and the second has done the same (on the bottom). The interior is fine, so it cooks well. The old saying applies, I guess you get what you pay for."
3,Not a genuine APC Battery !,"Even though the picture, and all of the descriptions refer to a genuine APC battery, I was sent an ""ABC"" battery instead. While it is fully compatible with the Back UPS, it is very misleading. In addition, you don't get a pre-paid return label to ship the used one back for recycling. Instead, you get a note telling you where you can send it, and that there is a charge for UPS to ship it back. The price is about $6.00 less than a genuine one directly from APC's website. And for the extra $6.00 bucks, you get the pre-paid return label. So the overall cost is about the same. I guess the real test is in how long this ""knock off"" battery will actually last. The real ""APC"" one lasted around 3 years. Only time will tell. But knowing this one isn't the real thing, I would NOT have bought it. But it may turn out to be fine in the long run. Who knows??? I guess it all depends on how you feel about purchasing ""knock off's"" with an unknown quality."
3,Incorrect Item Received,"Like Alan in yesterday's review I was also sent an ABC, American Battery Company, battery and NOT an APC, American Power Conversion, Battery. Not only that but the interior package, which had been opened and resealed, was from Ingram Micro to Amazon. This is a misleading description and photo.You cannot return batteries but Amazon is sending me a replacement battery, hopefully an APC battery, at no extra charge. Because of the holiday it will be a week. They are letting me keep the knockoff.I cannot figure out how to rate this since it is the wrong item. I would give 1 star because two of use have gotten the wrong part but 4 stars for fixing the problem. So will give it a 3 for now."
1,Sent the wrong size battery. This company is a zero for me.,"I bought a computer backup from Amazon and they gave the order to this company. They substituted another different sized battery that would not fir into the backup and had to be returned. After quite a long time, Amazon saw to it that a credit was issued.This company get a zero from me."
3,Beware of who you are buying from.,"I've purchased at least ten of these in the past from Amazon.com and they were all original APC batteries with free shipping to dispose the old battery. But I had sent the link to my office administrator to order the item and the item that comes up is the cheapest one out of the whole list, which in this case ends up being the ABC battery not the OEM one from APC. I haven't installed the battery yet so I hope it works ok. The other issue is now I need to either pay for shipping the old battery for disposal or find someplace to take the old battery locally which is not worth the $3 savings. I recommend to buy from Amazon even though it's $3 more, saves in the long run.I gave it 3 stars for now because I need to either pay to ship the old battery for disposal or find some place and drop it off to get it disposed properly which is time consuming. I think if they are not going to send you what is shown in the photos, it should be in a separate listing."
2,Dissapointed in Seattle,"I have always received exactly what I have ordered from Amazon and it's affiliates. Like many of you I paid extra to get this battery because, unlike the cheaper ones, it showed a picture of an APC brand battery. I also trusted it more because it was sold directly by Amazon not a third party. The description also says "" APC Replacement Battery Cartridge RBC4..."" I received an ABC battery instead. I am not happy."
5,Worth a few extra $$,I figure it's worth a little more for a battery that is going to be on trickle charge for at least 8 years. Tipping the scale for me was the free shipping to recycle the old battery. It's working fine.One note - be careful removing the old battery. The contacts can get stuck and it's easy to skin your finger (I did) trying to yank the old ones off.
4,Included return shipping for spent battery works great,The key item in my decision to use APC as opposed to an off-brand is that they include a return shipping label for recycling of the spent battery. If you price the cost of taking the old battery to a recycling dealer then the APC compares equally to the off-brands. And you get the APC warranty.
2,Potentially good 100 page book spread over 400 pages,"I read this book because the two ratings on this page were both 5 stars. I couldn't believe they said it was ""riveting"" -- I could barely get through the first 150-200 pages or so until you actually heard from the guy and what he had done. This initial part was hearing from his friends again and again interpreting his every breath and words for deep psychological analysis courtesy of the author. I ended up skipping about 50 pages and truly missed nothing in my reading of the rest of the book. The writing was dry and, most of all, I never cared about any of the characters. If you have your own fantasy about escaping to lay over your reading of this book, you may find it as good as the other reviewers. But if you are just a normal reader like me, in my opinion you will find it tedious and biased, and cringe just a little every time the author adds yet another quote bashing the ex-wife."
4,"College Dean flees his seemingly ""perfect"" life","I had a personal interest in this book---I purchased his time share in Florida when he deserted his wife, friends and job. My question? Why does a man who seems to have it all flee everything and leave no clues as to ""the whys"". The author probes the reasons and the effects on those left behind."
5,Zelda Ocarina Of Time Guide Review,This guide is great for those spots in the game where you can easily find yourself stuck. The depictions of the maps and dungeons are very helpful!
1,Save your money...,"This alarm clock is a joke. It has radio/CD, but the radio barely works, NOT a digital tuner by the way, (I live in the suburbs too)and the CD player is almost useless. It has one of those annoying string attenaes that you need to pin to the wall to get any reception whatsoever, and the CD player takes at least 30 secs to 1 min to recognize a CD. After putting in the CD and hitting play, if you want a track 4 or 5 tracks in you cant hit ""skip track"" to fast, or it will freeze and not play at all. It has all the basic alarm features, digital clock, snooze, 2 alarms, and you can set the alarm to CD or Radio. Lastly, the buzzer noise it has to wake you up is horrible. I don't think could be a worse sound. Every time i wake up I want to bash it in with a sledgehammer. Save your money folks.~T-Bear"
3,"Useful, but very expensive!","The book is a good logical guide to anyone guiding a company towards an ISO9000 certification. It assumes nothing on behalf of the reader. It's based around a practical example of a fictitious UK Company, and presents example documents, forms and many UK based references.The section on TickIT (ISO9000-3) at just 23 pages is disappointingly small, given t he prominence in the title.It makes a good framework for someone contemplating an ISO9000 certification, but be prepared to find supporting literature for the detail.Watch out too! Once the ISO9000 version 2000 standard is published this may no longer be the most relevant book to buy."
1,"Poor quality, avoid this brand of magnet.","A poor quality, Low-strength magnet that does NOT decouple my cars.Would not buy again. THis thing barely sticks to my fridge."
2,Rediculously large for an infant,"Here is an update of my earlier review:This product description is entirely misleading. There is no way this hat fits an infant. My daughter is two days old and is within the average size categories. This hat can be wrapped twice around her head. She may fit into it when she's 2 or 3 years old.My earlier review stated:I really doubt this is sized for an infant, it seems way too big, so I'm a bit disappointed that it will be too big to bring my baby home in from the hospital, and by the time it fits the baby, it will be summer already.Also, I don't like that it was not packaged, it just arrived in the mailing envelope with no package or tags. Makes me wonder of its origins and if it is in fact brand-new as advertised."
3,Kirk versus the devils.,This is one of the original Star Trek Novels first put out by Bantam in 1979. It does not follow the same formula length that the Pocket books maintain.The original Bantam series is a bit rarer than the Pocket novels of today. They are a reasonable next generation avenue of reading for the Star Trek fan.
5,Covers many aspects of basics in music,"This book is good for beginners from age 6 and above. It covers almost all basics in music notation, and progress at an easy pace throughout the book. Selection of music is nice, though sometimes I came across a few other adaptations and variaty in other books. I am a violin teacher, and I highly recommend this book as teaching material for new beginners to music."
4,Good Product,"This is very good, if you need boiling water in a hurry, but be gentle with it. The buttons will break off in 3-5 years if you're rough with it."
2,"Best available, unfortunately!","It appears that there are no good recordings of this opera. This is certainly not one. Colin Davis may have been instrumental in reviving an interest in Berlioz in Great Britain, but he consistently failed to live up to the great force and beauty of this composer's music. His reading is simply boring.Further problems with this recording are that it includes very inadequate singers. Berit Lindholm as Cassandra is the worst. Her voice is ugly, and so is her diction. It appears that there was no French coach during the rehearsals, as poor diction is symptomatic of the entire cast.The Clair de Lune duet between Didon and Eneas, probably the most beautiful in the entire opera, is poorly performed. At one point, Jon Vickers even sounds like he is yawning!The two stars I am giving this item are due to Josephine Veasey and Ian Partridge.The Berlioz Bicentennial came and went, and no new, and better, recording of this, his signature opera, was released. It's too bad!"
5,Wonderful booklet for simple easy recipes,"Over the past decade or two I must have purchased at least 35 copies of this book, mostly to give to people who want to know more about becoming vegetarian or vegan. It isn't very big, definitely not fancy, but provides so much information, tips, charts and great recipes for the price. I have used it in whole foods cooking classes for over two years. The last copies I bought were for people who canoe, kayak and backpack, who wanted to dehydrate entrees for their outdoor cooking. The back of the book has great tips on that and also recommends various recipes which are easy to dehydrate. If you want to cut down on the amount of refined foods, especially fats and sugars, in your diet, and slim your grocery bill by making your own healthy dressings, spreads (see pg 26), and milk substitutes, try this little powerhouse!"
2,we do not have similar tastebuds,joan and I are not on the same wavelength. I do not enjoy her cooking.
1,Of these you can freely eat,"I was looking for nightshade free recipes, not meat free. I'll never open this again. It'll go straight to a second hand store."
4,Of These Ye May Freely Eat,"This book is so simple to read, and the recipes are easy to make without a lot of unknown ingredients. The recipes in this book are completely free of animal products. In the back of the book is essential health information about sugars, cheese, protein and other topics. All of which are easy to understand. The price is so affordable for the information and the use you will get out of this book. It's definetly a book you shouldn't be without if your main concern is time and health."
5,Hope & Recovery the Workbook,This is an excellent thought provoking easy to use tool to anyone seeking help in overcoming sexual addiction and/or obsessive sexual thoughts. It could be of help to other seeking a step by step approach to working through the 12 steps. I am using it and have found the process of writing down the answers is transforming my recovery.. albeit NOT perfect.. its about progress and this is a good progress tool.. even better when you use it working with someone else.
2,Not as good as other Smith walking workouts,"I admit I am not a big country fan to begin with, but I found the music selected for this workout to be poor. I gave it a chance; the pace of the workout is good, but the music was a continual irritant. I much prefer the instrumental music that is used on most of Smith's other walking workout CDs. Choose this on only if you REALLY like country music!"
2,Disappointing resource for helping kids learn acceptance.,"I bought this book after reading several positive reviews on it. However, I was very disappointed with it. The author attempted to make the book culturally diverse and inclusively based, but I did not find her method effective. I did not like the premise of the book that in order to be acceptable to others, there have to be commonalities. Differences as well as similarities should be embraced to better understand the individual. Stereotypes and finding similarities are not necessary in describing or understanding individuals."
1,"This is not a accessory for large format (16"") notebooks","For people who are buying 16"" LCD notebooks this is not the carry case for you. ... I purchased the notebook as well as this carry case. When I received the order I realised that the notebook would not fit in the carry case...."
3,"Plenty of space and pockets, not very comfortable","The Targus Notebook backpack is as advertised: a backpack optimized to carry a notebook. It features a padded pocket for the laptop and other compartments for all the junk that you need to bring with the laptop.The only real drawback is that when fully loaded with a 6 to 8 lb. laptop, it's a very uncomfortable backpack. The straps just aren't adjustable enough to fit the wide range of shoulders in our office and most people who travelled with it reported pain and fatigue after a 1/2 hour of use.This item is okay for short totes, but I wouldn't want to try dashing across an airport with a one or doing something else that requires me to wear it for a long period of time. However, if you must have a backpack for your laptop then this would be the one to get."
2,I sold it!,"Big, heavy, not many diagrams or photos. Index not detailed. Difficult to read because has shiny/glossy paper and shiny black print, so the light reflects off the paper. Sorry. Don't buy it, don't use it. Stick with Nelson's. As to what the other reviewer said about the treatment strategies in this book. Honestly...Don't read the big texts for therapeutics. THese texts take years to print and edit, invariably sometimes the therapy is outdated or there is a newer therapy. That's what journals and up to date and emedicine are for. Read the texts for the physiologic purposes, differentials, overview. But for therapeutic guidelines, use more recent sources."
3,A minor Anime offering,Dark Cat is a fairly decent piece of magic themed Anime. The animation is fair and the story is equally mediocre. It is an odd mixture of soap-opera camp and gory scenes of demons ripping people to pieces.
4,Sitting Bull,I really enjoyed this book. The chapter book is a great informational book with real pictures. I would recommend this book for any student interested in learning about Sitting Bull and his life achievements.
4,Elsa TED 451,This book is great for anyone interested in learning about the land struggles Native Americans faced during the 19th century. Its use of primary sources enhances the understading of Sitting Bull's life and of the Lakota Sioux nation. It produce a greater interest in wanting to seek further information about the topics convered within the biography's chapters.
2,too elementary,The information is good but the text is dumbed down. I would have liked it better for a 9-year-old is the writing had been better.
4,Great Grandma Loves it!,"Haven't used personally, but my arthiritic great-grandma has said these have helped her to be able to crochet again with much less pain."
3,Not what I expected,"From the title and available information I thought this was a compendium of works by Latino authors, Instead it's essentially an annotated bibliography. Nice, but not what I was looking for."
2,Only received part B,"Please be careful if ordering a used copy of this book. It's divided into 2 sections, A and B, with the same ISBN (which was probably a bad idea of the publisher). Part B is the only part with a barcode. Me and a classmate both ordered this book used (and fulfilled by Amazon), and both only received the second half. Thankfully Amazon was willing to give a full refund."
1,Forget about this book!,"One star is even too much!With this book you can only have an idea of what is going on, it is more like a little bit of everything rather than a complete understanding. If you really want to learn about electronics take ""Microelectronic Circuit Design"" by Richard C. Jaeger; it is much better and gives you a compleate coverage and explanation."
5,Very Thorough Text,"The problems and exercises in the book are POORLY constructed:In order to solve a problem, you may very well have to constantly flip back and forth between pages because the author was too cheap to put a simple diagram on the same page as the problem.I.e.""Use Figure P2.30 and the V-i characteristic in figure 2.550 to solve for the circuit values in Figure 2.75, with R=25k ohms ....""That would involve flipping back and forth between a lot of pages.However, the problems are very thorough and cover a great deal of the subject w/o wasting too much time. For various circuits, the author goes directly to Thevenin Equivalent circuits rather than showing a concept using a dozen or more different circuits."
4,Just like the title says,"Over the course of the past few months I have had many friends in need of some comfort cooking--because of new babies, illnesses, work stresses, and other major life changes. Instead of a card, what these people need the most is some good food that they don't have to cook for themselves. This cookbook has updated classics, like polenta lasagne or stuffed peppers a la Michael Chiarello, old stand bys like chicken noodle soup and oatmeal cookies, even a section with herbal tonics and smoothies.The ingredients are easy to find and the recipes are easy to follow. I especially like the To Make Ahead instructions for each recipe. There's no guessing if a dish freezes well, or how to cook/assemble it for later. I write out these instructions for whomever gets the dish. Everyone loves gifts of pre-made, homemade meals."
3,INTERESTING,"This CD contains a lot of interviews from the Early 50's. It is interesting to hear all these interviews, most uncut. You can hear the rare ""Truth about me"" 78RPM. You can also hear early radio promo's with his 2nd manager BOB NEIL. And hear Elvis clearing up the marriage roumer and hear him flirting with a dj's wife!!!! (not really). Contains no music by Elvis himself, but does have snippets of songs between the interviews."
3,Book looses momentum half way through,"I have enjoyed all of J. Olsen's books exceopt for this one. The book starts out great...with Olsen's typically tight narrative style, but by the second half looses it's plot focus...turning out to be a portrait of a disappointment. On the other hand, I'll probably buy his next book if it's a police procedural type."
5,Great book,"I think Jack Olsen did a wonderful job of painting a picture in the minds eye of familys that were suffering from so many of todays addictions, drugs, alochol, sex... Unfortianitly our young people suffer the choices of our adults. The Gere family will stay in the minds of those who were touched with there story."
5,Average,Was expecting more drama from this one. The story seemed to drag in the middle as the law was apparently incapable of bringing the perpetrator to justice. You feel for the family - it's tragic. But the story could have been told better.
1,Not Compatible,"I wish I could rate this product on the performance, unfortunately I never made it that far. It is not compatible with Windows ME or Windows 2000."
2,No windows XP driver and no plans for driver in future,"I have had other D-link products and have dealt with the same issue. They are not very supportive of XP. Can it really be THAT hard to massage their drivers to work with XP? I think if you want to sell tech products such as these, you should be supporting the latest Operating systems because we all are going to have XP eventually. This just burns me! This is the second D-link product that loses support soon after it is sold.Needless to say, I wont be buying from D-link anymore. This thing is useless to me with no XP drivers."
2,"What, no sound?","The site advertises that you can ""Make Your Own Movie"", but what good is a movie without the sound? The device only inputs video through it's S-Video and RCA inputs. It's good because of it's small size and adaquate framerate, but because of it's lack of sound, I'm only giving it 2 stars."
5,One of the best books I've read in a long time!,"An excellent first novel. Parry's use of the vernacular of the times adds flavor to an exciting and suspenseful story. Parry's hero, Abel Jones, is a Welshman with his own prejudices that are common to the times(The Irish are all drunks, the Germans will never be good soldiers). Parry manages to capture an authentic feel of the times by using historical characters such as McClellan, Pinkerton, Lincoln, and others to flesh out the story. This was one of the best books I have read in a long while. I look forward to reading subsequent books in the series."
5,Fantastic,I burned my way through this novel in one night. It was fantastic research wonderful prose and an engaging plot. I cannot wait for the sequel.
5,Faded Coat of Blue,I thoroughly enjoyed Abel Jones'adventures. Mr Parry has brought the era of the Civil War directly into our homes with his wonderful book. The narrative voice of Abel Jones in the storytelling is refreshing.
2,A parry to Parry,"I wonder what book the rest of these reviewers read. I personally found this novel to be semi-atrocious. Yes, the author writes well, yes, the plot is semi-intriguing. But, the plot is also quite predictable! Furthermore, I read a third of it then stopped. Why? I realized that I didn't care about the characters. Why read a book if your heart is not in it? If you love the Civil War, and don't mind mindless boredom then by all means read this book. If you love the Civil War, and want a good novel, write one."
4,Good start to the series,"His latter books are much better, but this is a good start to the series. The main characters are strong and he captures the historical atmosphere very well"
4,An unusual sleuth,"Set in 1862, this finely written historic murder-suspense novel is a delightful read from cover to cover. You can't help but root for Abel Jones, the fine Welshman sent by General McClellan to solve the mystery behind the terribler death of a handsome aritocratic officer. The writing is solid, the use of language colorful and accurate. A fine piece of literature that almost anyone would enjoy."
