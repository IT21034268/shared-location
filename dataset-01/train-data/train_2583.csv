1,Not worth your time,"this game used to be great. Sony Online Entertainment(SOE) decided to take the game in a different direction because it is believed that anything which has the star wars name on it should be a blockbuster, hence the game was changed from an emersive fun to play difficult to master game into a sorry excuse for a mmorpg/fps Worlds of Warcraft clone. it was not successful and veteran players are leaving in droves. this game is not worth your time or money. if you are looking for a mmorpg there are better out there. if you are looking for a star wars themed game there are better out there, without a monthly fee."
1,SWG has become one of the worse MMO's on the market,"This game has gone down hill since the first Combat upgrade 6 months ago. Now with the NGE, they have reduced this game to 9 classes. Jedi used to be a hard profession to obtain, but a very viable combat profession. Now it is an out of the box profession that has no purpose in combat. Jedi deal the least amount of damage, yet have 0 defense and can only kill creatures or NPC's that are below thier combat level. The Devs are constantly making changes to the game, such as changing the chat system so you have to hit enter each time you want to chat. There has always been an option for modal or Modeless chat, but due to marketing this game to 9 year olds, it seems that they had to dumb down the UI. After playing this for over 2 years I am very disappointed in the changes. I would not recommend this game to anyone, nor will I purchase anymore SOE or Lucas Arts products."
1,Disappointing and Disgraceful Company Tactics,"After playing this game for almost 3 years, the game has finally become an embarasment. This new expansion was suddenly released without any customer feedback resulting in the abolishment of the diverse professions (32 now to a paltry 9). The game has become a poor man's (FPS), well not really poor mans, it still costs $15a month. For that you get a simplistic graphical interface, a game laden with bugs, and absent customer service. It is sad to see a game changed dramatically and abruptly into a more simplistic and less fun version. With great saddness I can no longer recommend this game and strongly recommend you read the other reviews and even the game forums of all the existing problems. This game is not worth playing in its beta form."
1,No Customer Service,"Before you even think about buying this game, check out the bbb.org and look up Sony Online Entertainment. You will see hundreds of complaints filed about SoE. These complaints range from poor customer service to bait and switch tactics which are illegal.Players are forced to play just one profession. The Next Generation Enhancements that went live on November 15th, 2005 reduced the number of professions from 33 down to 9. Combat is broken and crafting is ignored by the developers. Complaints on the forums are usually locked and/or deleted quickly. Forget about calling customer service too, the automated system takes you around and around and never connects you a person. If you have any technical issues with the game, tech support always blames your computer for the problem. You will be told to update your drivers, hardware, internet, etc...I have been playing this game for over 2 years and have canceled my accounts. It's just not worth it anymore."
5,Let's play some SWG,"I really enjoy the game. I've been playing since SWG came out and have been there through all the changes, updates and expansions. One reason Im leaving this review is because it is a real exciting game now - and Im tired of hearing all the players complain. I really dont believe SOE or LucasArts wants to make a game that ppl hate - COME ON ...IT'S STAR WARS...lets have some FUN."
1,"Loved it for 2 years, but now it's crap",The NGE sucks. Nuff said. I'll go play a different MMORPG. ANY of them.
1,Waste of money,The only thing good about this game was selling my jedi account for 2k+ before the CU downgrade.
1,its trash,"Good Day.I have played swg for many years off and on including after the NGE and I am here to tell you BEWARE! This game is not worth the $4.50 + $15 monthly subscription fee, your time, and certainly not your emotions after playing this garbage.Check out WoW. Blizzard creates top notch games."
1,SOE ruined this game!,The New Game Enhancements introduced ruined one of the best MMORPG's on the market. It is now just an ill conceived first person shooter with no direction. They removed over 20 professions from the game and the interface is now unusable. All the servers are ghost town now and there is a mass exodus from the game. I do NOT recommend this game!!!!
1,Dying a horrible death,"It had a lot of originality when it came out 2.5 years ago. Now it's trying to be a cookie cutter and a dumbed down game. Don't play this. Don't give your money to SOE. Run far. Run fast.If you don't believe me, how about all the rest of thier players?http://forums.station.sony.com/swg/board?board.id=swggpdiscussion"
1,NGE destroyed SWG,"If you are a big Star Wars fan and like simplistic child like games, and you start a new game every month...this game is for you.If on the other hand you are a big Star Wars Fan and want to live the real Star Wars Experience, then you are too late. The Developers of the game destroyed the old game and released what they call New Game Enhancements to the old game, essentially ruining the economy, forcing master jedi to use rifles to compete with other classes, and chasing all the 3 yr veterans of the game away with lies, deceipt and false promises."
1,dont waste your time,"i've been playing MMOs for 10 years and i played star wars galaxies for 2 and a half of those. then the NGE came and removed everything that was interesting and unique about this game. now its just like 90% of any other MMO out there. level grind and kill loot repeat, when it used to be so much more. dont waste your time, you could have all of your hard work wiped out and rendered useless too. they completely removed 2 of my characters professions and didnt convert any of their stuff. they have no idea what they want to even do with this game anymore and they change direction everytime the wind blows. worst dev team i have ever seen in any game in my life, a real disapointment"
1,ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE,"SWG WAS one of the best games in the market today. Rich and delightfuly complex. Despite the horrible customer service from SOE, SWG had the deepest and most involved community of and MMORPG.SWG was incredible with over 40 professions to choose from. From Jedi to Bounty Hunter or just plain dancers, there was a wonderful mix of combat and non-combat classes.now there are ONLY NINE classes to choose from. A HORRIBLE combat system full of bugs and glitches. It's amazing how SOE took one of the best games and ruined it.SOE is now in the game of deleting any forum posts in their forums that critisize them. SOE openly admits trying to corrupt online poll results by falsely entering positive data when all reviews are negative.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
1,Stay as far away from this game as you can,"game is not anywhere close to being half way doneall of the ""Quests"" are bugged and mostly uncompleatablecombat is simular to a bad earily 90's FPS gameSony has the worst possible customer service the one thingyou can count on is they will lie and attempt to decieveyou in order to get your money players are leaving the game in droves at this point the game could hardley be called a MMOif you wish to see first hand the players dissatifaction with this ""Game"" look to the SWG forums boards and read the game play discussion"
1,"SWG ""AN AWFUL JOKE""","A once great game, but times have changed. Server populations are extremly low, customer service is horrible, game UI is very nintendo like, new version of game is also bug filled and designed for 9 year olds. I could go on for days but Im sure my fellow players here will tell you the whole story.. good luck but be afraid to deal with sony online!!!!"
1,Sad to see what sony has done,"A long long time ago I entered the beta for SWG. I met some great people and had fun for almost 18 mos. I was one of the first jedi on my server and still remember the amazing feeling I had when that happened. I could go on and on about how wonderful this game once was.Now Sony has completely changed the game and created a mockery of what was once fun. I should warn you that the box itself is a lie when you are reading it. Many of the things like 30 professions are outright lies and other things are highly misleading. The game you buy is not the game that is now on the servers. The interface is poorly conceived and clunky. The so-called quest system is constantly being dumbed down and will soon require no effort at all.Avoid sony, avoid sony's games and above all put your 15 dollars into something more useful like 5 chia pets. I promise you'll get more excitement from it."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE,"I bought this game last month. And have yet been able to play. I, like some other people that have this kit, have only gotten error messages. I have gone to the sony tech support, as well as my ISP, and HP tech support. The game still won't work. I contacted sony again, and I am still waiting for an answer.Do not buy this kit. If you have never purchased SWG and played it, it will not work for you. So far the only ones that have seem to be able to get this software to work properly. Are those that have already been playing the game.My computer is barely two months old. It supports another RPG online game I play. No problems with that one. There is something wrong with this software."
1,Be wary of this game,Massive changes to the game over the past year have degraded it signficantly. I would be careful before buying this game. Especially now as it currently is rife with bugs and broken gameplay mechanics. Watch the official forums to see if any improvements occur before you act.
1,Beware!,"There are enough negative reviews to explain the poor changes to this game...my only point to make is that when you see alot of disparity in ratings, look at the rating history people have. Go through the 5 stars and see if they're real or just pumpers/employees that have a 'horse in the race'There aren't many that have history, which should raise a red flag."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!,"If you spend your money on this game you are wasting your time unless you like games that lack content, fun and quite literally made me sick. Upon login, I was unable to stay only for more than 20-30 minutes because the new FPS system that Sony has implemented into the game gives me motion sickness. Don't waste your money...PLEASE."
1,Not worth it.,"I have some friends that played this in the past that said they liked it. I guess they made a major change to the game because it is terrible. When I finally got on the planet I hardly saw anyone else, and the ones I talked to all said that they are quitting. Doesn't sound like a smart move to buy this. I would buy Battlefront II or even Knights of the Old Republic II instead."
1,Paying to test the game,"That's what you'll be doing. In short,this was easily the best, most comprehensive MMO out there. 35 (!!!) professions. What other MMO could match that? Player driven economy. To obtain a Jedi was a badge of distinctions. Now? Nine professions. Jedi is a selectable at the beginning and is now the weakest combat class. The UI is....terrible to be brief. No, I didn't have a Jedi. I see it from the other side. Buy this game or throw 15 dollars out the window and jump after it. It will be less painful."
1,Star Wars Galaxies The complete Mess 1 year later,"It doesnt matter if your old school or new school, After 1 year later, Galaxies is still a complete mess. Thats my most people are still doing World of Warcraft. If you are the type who love to mash buttons, then galaxies is your game, If you dont mind where a game gets the nerfed treatment, then this is your game. If this is so good, then somebody please explain to me why that warcraft has around 5 million users where galaxies as what 250,000 maybe?"
1,"SWG = RIP, NGE = Next Grand Exodus, SOE = Screwin Over Everyone","Avoid this game like the plague.I'll even go as far as saying this game has driven me to the point of completely boycotting any Sony and/or Lucas Company, permanently.There's so much more I could say, but honestly, it's simply not worth my time to tell you, or your time to listen.It's simply THAT BAD."
1,It's a shame what SOE and L/A did to the game!!!!!,"I have thouroughly enjoyed Star Wars Galaxies for over a year and a half now, but this last change to the game ie; NGE, Starter Kit or what have you, is a joke!!!! It's a game now full of bugs, why SOE would force this down intelligent peoples throat and tell us this is what we wanted is pathetic. If you want to be a beta tester for a lousy game it's well worth the money."
1,game ruined by cooperate theives,"WARNING DO NOT BUYThis game has been completely ruined in attempt to gain new customers. Look at gamespy, gamespot, stratic.com or any other gaming site and look at the polls they are taking, they do not lie. If you want a good starwars game buy Battlefront 2. If you want starwars games better then this one buy anything in the $5 bin at wally world"
1,Wow sweet game!,"If you love to be lied to, and having everything you worked for for 2 years be made completely useless! If you were even considering buying this, I suggest you hit the back button on your browser and consider buying this:(...)instead."
1,An unfinished game after 3 years,"Save your money, wait until they actually have a plan to finish this game and post it at their web site. Until now all they say is wait, wait wait.....it has been three years..."
1,Palpatine himself runs Sony Online Entertainment!,"Imagine this........A game that......every 6 months a new ""upgrade"" comes out that renders all your previous hard work, loot, weapons, etc worthless.Non existent customer support.......if you complain on the SWG forums they delete your post or they ban your account.Sound like fun?........"
1,Star wars galaxies: An empire let down.,"I am a veteran of SWG-- I've played since release in june 03'. Sony Online ENtertainment and Lucasarts have ruined this game, they have made it worthless and a gigantic waste of time. They took everything that made this game unique and threw it into the blender with Lineage II, City of Villains, and World Of Warcraft, maybe a little Battlefront mixed in. I do NOT recomend buying this game unless you are 12 or under.If you do not like being lied to this is not a game for you, Sony has lied to it's community for 2.5 years+ and is not reliable.Do not waste your time on this game, there isn't even a star warsy feel to it."
1,Ok it got a few good reviews,"If you read below you'll find about 3 reviews favoring this game, and over 80 negative reviews. Now read the positive reviews and look at how they're written. Reads kinda like a press release or marketing jingle doesn't it? Now go to Google and search for this:sony fakes reviewsSony, of which SOE is a subsidiary of, has a proven track record of using thier marketing department pretend to be happy customers to pad negative reviews. They are currently settling I think 2, if not more, lawsuits that have been filed because of these fake reviews. I'd say 2 of the 3 positive reviews here could easily be SOE employees, if not all 3. The game really is crap, and the only people talking positive about it is the SOE spin team."
1,"A buggy, broken game","Bugs galore, empty servers, poor game play, and a new low in bad treatment of customers by a gaming company.Currently the worst MMORPG still running ( although they've lost so many players that it's only a matter of time until it's shut down )Save yourself some cash and abuse and skip this piece of trash!"
1,Most exciting MMO ruined.,"As an MMO gamer of 6+ years, and a Star Wars Galaxies player of close to 2 years, SWG (as it is known) used to be by far the most exciting MMO available. The customization options were amazing, you could usually recognize another player from very far away, The PvP was outstanding, and the profession choices were exciting. It was one of the few games in which you could change your profession at will. Gone are the customization options, the excitement of PvP (unless point-and-click gets you going)and the many diverse profession choices. Gone also, are many many of the veteran players, and my respect for SOE as a company. What you read about their extreme lack of Customer respect, and satisfaction is indeed true. Heed the warnings of the majority of these reviews, and you will save yourself money, time and dissatisfaction."
1,Fair Warning Bad Game,"Very buggy game, targeting and combat are difficult and twitched based. Enemies can shoot you through walls and run around 2 or 3 times faster then you can, specials items don't always work. All characters are the same with little or no way to make yours original. For a MMORG their is now no longer any player based economy.I am not a veteran player of SWG, played for two weeks prior to the complete overhaul of this game. This game was fun, had tons of depth, there was a strong player based economy and lots of socialization in cantinas. That is all gone, along with the 32 professions and there is still no content, and many of the missions are still bugged.AVOID THIS GAME AT ALL COST!!!!"
1,An Abysmal Game with Zero FUN,"I can't warn you off this game enough. SOE and Lucas Arts showed a blatant disregard for their long time customers by publishing this 'New Game Experience' with only two weeks notice, and one day after many customers paid $29.95 for the Trial of Obiwan expansion. A refund for ToOW was offered, but people who had long term subscriptions are now stuck in a game they do not like and did not ask for.The NGE as it is called is worse then a beta program. The User Interface is completely unplayable. Jedi is a useless profession. Commando, Spy and Trader are broken professions. Most of the 130 exciting new quests are bugged and unfinishible. They turned a challenging game that let you adapt and change into a quasi first person shooter with zero personality and zero fun.Please stay away and save your money."
2,internet game,My son bought this not realizing that he would still have to pay per month to play it. Although he likes the game he cannot afford to pay every month just to play it.
1,Very generic.,"This book doesn't worth the money... The author made a big mistake by trying to cover all Canada-Wide and all sectors... I found very few employer in the hi-tech capital (Ottawa), and the most important part, the information provided was very basics and very generic. review for 2001 edition"
5,Durable and easily interchangeable with other size cuffs,"I purchased the Lifesource large cuff to go along with theLifeSource Blood Pressure Monitor with AccuFit Extra Large Cuffthat already included an extra large cuff. The two cuffs are easily interchangeable and it's more of a plug and play system. Very simple to use. Overall, the cuff itself is very durable and will last a long time. The cuff adjusts easily and has clear instructions printed right on it. It's simple to use each and every time."
1,Incompatible with UA-853,"I purchased this cuff after purchasing the UA-853 model. This small cuff will not work with the UA-853. The monitor instructions recommend a medium or large cuff. They don't exactly say the samll cuff will not work, but when I got an error, I called customer service and confirmed they are not compatible. I spent a lot of time for nothing. It would have been easy to just state in the product description which models the cuff would work with."
5,pressure cuff,"I was very happy with the pressure cuff I purchased. It was the exact one I was looking for and was much cheaper from Amazon than from the manufacturer. I received my purchase faster than expected. So, I'm pleased with my Amazon purchase once again."
3,Large arm blood pressure cuff,Works well but wish it had spring steel cuff in it to help get it on. Must for large arm.
3,Doesn't fit my blood pressure outfit.,"This item will not replace the one that wore out on my blood pressure monitor. I should have looked more carefully before ordering it, and I would recommend the same. Otherwise, I think it would have worked well, but I wasted my money on it as I live in Croatia, and returning it to Amazon would not be worth the price."
5,LifeSource B/P Machine Cuff Replacement,"Received cuff in timely delivery, good condition. New replacement cuff is an improvement over the old one. Nice features, works great."
5,Just what the doctor ordered.,Very satisfied with this cuff. Was happy to find the exact cuff for the monitor that I had. Thought it was at a great price. Delivery was quick it arrived in just a few days.
4,BP Cuff,Ordered this product as a replacement for existing small cuff. Arrived in a timely manner. Product was easy to switch out. Good buy.
2,NO RIGHT SIZE OF THE HOSE,"The hose of the cuff is extremely long:40 inches , may be must be for use in hospitals.NO GOOD.PEDRO ROGELIO"
1,fitness waistband,Not satisfied with this product. Tears easily. Would not recommend purchasing. Product seems to be made of cheap material and not worth the price I paid.
4,Thought Provoking,"A startling, alarming account of the battles in WW I written with an astonishing essence of credibility and authenticity."
2,Not very good,"Should have been titled ""Architecture in some parts of Germany and Austria"". I was expecting a lot more. Very disappointing."
5,Great Spatulas!,"As I spend a lot of time cooking in the galley of a boat I've tried lots of different brands of nylon utensils because I need something that will not rust in the salty environment. Calphalon has the only spatulas that have a fine enough edge to easily lift pancakes and crepes (for when I'm not feeling nimble enough to flip them in the pan) without ripping them apart, and the edge has not disintegrated/melted over time from heat, as other brands do, even after six months of constant use."
2,handles weighted wrong,"These are very attractive and work great as long as you don't let go of one. They are weighted in the handles and all of these utensils constantly fall out of skillets and pans. Besides this being messy, if one hits you it could be dangerous. After many accidents, I don't use them anymore. I do not recommend."
4,Succint overview of a photographer s lifelong work.,"This book is a delighful overview of Mr Adams' years of photographing cotton woods. The book, part of a larger series by the publishers, is not as well printed as it could be, most of the other books in the series have been wonderfully reproduced.This book I feel lets Mr Adams down slightly in it's quality of printing. The quiet poetics of Mr Adams' work is still apparent - if you know of him and his work already - first time readers of his images however may find it difficult to understand him and his work based on this book alone. Still this is a small [inexpensive] book which would be good to keep on the shelves to show students for example."
5,Illuminating,"Tozer sums up perfectly what the Spirit accomplished through this book in me. ""The function of a good book is to stand like a signpost directing the reader toward the Truth and the Life (pg15)."" If you are looking for direction to the Truth and the Life admist the shallowness and lack of fortitude in the majority of Christian authors today, this book will be like a breath of fresh air. Crisp, cool, clean air. If you are held captive by complacency and wallowing in stagnant waters, prepare to get woke up!"
2,Questionable Teachings,"As a Lutheran I found this book to be very suspect. I know that other love it, but I couldn't get past the fact that the author divorces the work of the Holy Spirit from the means of grace; the Word of God and God's sacraments. He seems to work from an understanding that the Holy Spirit works independently from even God's Word and that his primary function is to cause a believer to do something, rather than to keep the person in the Christian faith and direct that person to the Savior, Jesus.There were aspects that were challenging and helpful, but overall I was not pleased with the theology of the book and couldn't recommend it to others."
1,Yawn - Lessig sure thinks a lot of himself,"It will be nice when gas bags such as Lessig are finally measured for the value they have brought us as a society.The NASDAQ/Dot.com go-go days of the late 90's are dead -and we are better off for it. The hyper-hyperbole driven ""economy"" where value was temporarily lost under the sofa cushions should be a wakeup call to all of those who think that the next brilliant idea will come from some clown in a loft in the Bay Area or some other hip place - selling dog food online, discussing the owning of their ""space,"" setting out a new ""value proposition"" and all of the rest of the babble that went on far too long.Mr. Lessig, could you super-size that for me, and I'm in a hurry."
1,From whence comes invention?,"Ultimately, the flaw in Lessig's books is his belief that the revolution of personal computing and the internet are the products of intellectuals like himself. Undermining the freedom and property rights of the programmers and companies who really invented these marvels is a profound threat to one of America's most vital and creative industries."
3,Complex But Wonderful Nonetheless,"The book is written in a very complex style -- especially the sections where Lessig goes into the nitty gritty of the architecture behind the Internet -- but the book is a wonderful read, especially for those who come from the mindset that copyright laws should serve to give full control to the creator. While Lessig's style is unnecessarily complex, the book is ultimately worth the effort -- especially for Internet enthusiasts and entrepreneurs who need to understand the implications of copyright laws and how they affect culture and future ideas."
5,Good review,Deep understanding on what is going on with intelectual property that we don't see on the newspapers
5,"IF YOU HAVE NOT HEARD OF HIM, U DON'T KNOW WHAT U'RE MISSING","If you've never heard of Don Diego, you have most certainly missed a treat. Don is undoubtly one of the baddest saxaphone players in the WORLD! I do mean that literally. He is by far better than Kirk Whalum, who has used his style, technique, and music.It's really sad that he does not have a MAJOR record deal. This man is unreal. If you've ever seen him live, you would'nt want to see anyone else blowing a horn. The next time you are in Dallas, Texas, look him up. He is definately worth it! And oh yea, buy ALL of his albums, you won't regret it."
1,Misleading Advertising!!! Buyer Beware!!,"I bought this item expecting a rescue can and bracket and received only the bracket. The item description said: ""Outstanding unit for multi-victim and scuba diver rescues. It has twice the buoyancy of other cans. It includes a 10' line and nylon shoulder strap."" The ad included a photo of a 34"" rescue can, but apparently, the seller is only selling the mounting bracket, which I think is incredibly irresponsible at best, and grossly misleading at worst.Upon contacting the seller, they have agreed to issue a refund, as well as refund postage. At least I'll get my money back - I'm crossing my fingers."
1,Editorial Review Inaccurate,"Although I haven't actually red the book yet, I did some research as to which translation to read. Having read that translations by Constance Garnett were awful I sought to avoid them. The editorial review lists the translators as Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky, whom I had read good things about, but the translator is actually Sidney Monas, whoever the heck that is.I don't know if this is a good translation or not, it's just not the wone I was looking for. Amazon has to get better at giving the correct information for their Kindle e-book products."
2,Ditto,"I agree completely with the other reviewer, and have nothing to add of value, other than to say that this book is disappointing compared to my initital expectation that Karpov was going to be taching a kind if chess course in this book."
2,Definitely not worth the money,"The Trimmer has lots of features but is not the best in the market, I would suggest spending a few bucks more to get a better one."
5,I love Babylicious!,"I love Babylicious so I knew I was going to love this product. I purchased a unisex print in 2007 before my son was born, since we didn't know what we were having. I was going to use the same set for baby #2, but she came early and this set made complete sense. I love the orange and pink colors together. I also bought the baby bedding, pillow, and changing table cover. Against the bright orange walls with white furniture it looks amazing! Quality is great, which I knew from my last purchase."
5,A fantastic resource for those learning Chinese!,"This is an indispensable resource for learning Chinese characters. The flashcards are high quality and a perfect size that balances readability and portability. The front of the card contains the character in large font, and also the frequency of usage, character radical, traditional character equivalent (if different), and stroke order. The back of the card contains the pinyin pronunciation, the definition of the character, and a number of words that contain the character, along with each definition.I have only one complaint with the flashcards. Because of a lack of space, the stroke orders are sometimes abbreviated, combining a few steps. It isn&#65533;t always apparent which of the combined strokes should be written first. Stroke order aside, this is the best set of Chinese-language flashcards that I have come across."
5,Excellent learing tool,"I wanted a way to learn a bunch of commonly used Chinese characters easily and this set of flash cards has really delivered. Not only do you get the Pinyin and definition, you get the traditional version of the character, the radical (if any), the stroke order, and words that use the character. I am very pleased with this set of flash cards and wouldn't hesitate to recommend them."
1,Bushings,"I bought these bushings for a 2001 Dodge Ram 1500 4x4, for the rear leaf springs. This truck has an OEM suspension but the bushings were not the correct size. It states in the item description that they are designed for an 1 3/4 eye opening on the spring, but the stock leaf spring has an eye opening of 1 1/2 inch. In retrospect, I should have tried to measure the eye opening before ordering, but who would have thought there was a reason to do it? So do yourself a favor and try to measure yours before ordering. I was able to adapt these bushings to make them work because I didn't have time to wait for the correct ones to show up. Thank you."
2,"""cuts into the butt""","my mom uses this bedpan and it is literally a pain in the a$$$$, she has no choice to use but to use it since she cannot use her commode by her beside yet.."
2,Sharp raw edge,I got to say the front edge is quite raw as the other review has mentioned. It hurts my mom's leg since she had problem moving her left leg. I wouldn't have bought it if I saw the review. I guess I was sold on the picture and color. Luckily she is getting better and could avoid that raw edge. Definitely wouldn't recommend others to buy it.
3,razor sharp edges,"This seems like a good product, however be careful in first handling it.There were razor sharp edges, where the molds sections meet, one of whichnicked my finger. After the edges were filed down, it would appear to beusable."
1,Not as pictured.,This company is sending out cheap pontoon pans not like the traditional one pictured. I requested they change their picture but was told no!! Don't buy it if the one pictured is what you want.
2,Amazon is shipping old stock,"I just received this bed pan. The first thing I noticed were the sharp edges like another reviewer noted, and filed them down. Then I noticed the tailbone depression in the back like another reviewer noted was in the old style. Finally I noticed the styling was different than pictured with the item. Amazon is shipping old stock. I'm in a quandry because my mom is coming home from the hospital in 2 days, and I need to exchange this, which will take more than 2 days."
4,EASY INSTALLATION,"I put this hitch on 2003 Honda CRV in 45 minutes, it was a piece of cake didn't even need a jack. Everything lined up perfectly. My only complaint is that the muffler clunks against the hitch when I am turning or on rough roads. I willl need to grind some metal off the hitch, not a lot but enough to be annoyingly tedious."
4,Very nice hitch++++++++,"I put this on our 2006 Honda CR-V (EX). To my surprise it was very easy to install. It took me about 20-30 minutes to install it myself. I read other reviews about ""the muffler clucking against the hitch and having to grind some metal off of the hitch"". I attached everything and did notice that the bolt that attaches the hitch to the frame above the muffler was close to, but not touching, the top of the muffler. As a precaution, I decided to grind down the head of the bolt slightly to create a little bit more room before I reattached the muffler. So far, there have not been any clunks or rattles. The hitch looks very nice on the vehicle and I would recommend this one to anyone!"
4,Mandarin language only!,"The authenticity is obvious, however it would have been considerate to list that it is in the Mandarin language only. My Mandarin is is strong enough only to make out the occasional words."
2,chinese massage cupping,This video was supposed to be in English and it is not. It has sub titles and I find it difficult to watch. Chinese Massage: Cupping
3,chinese massage:cupping,The problem with this DVD everything is in chinese and I cannot understand this language.I would have preffered if this was in english.
3,TOO LITTLE HERE,"The basic facts behind Florida's hurricane history are included here. The book is filled with figures and statistics. No storm is left out. Yet much of what is included could probably be found in an internet search. The book is too small to provide much of real value to most readers. Other publications will give the reader more for the money, even if he is interested only in Florida."
5,Wedding favors,"A must buy! I bought these matches to use as part of our wedding favors. I printed labels for each side of the matches (one side said our names, the other side said the date), then combined them with a purple votive candle, wrapped in tulle and finished with a purple ribbon. Turned out adorable. If you're looking for cheap matches that are great quality, these are them!"
3,housecoat,Was just as advertised. Not expensive but nice. the picture of this was 100%. would buy again and again. already washed no color change or size
5,Perfect DIY bonbonieries,Just what we were after but could not locate in that quantity in Austraila. These will make very affordable momentum for our family and friends from our wedding.
1,Junk,"It is the worst Calphalon pan I have ever purchased. Threw it in the garbage can last week after I reached my breaking point trying to clean it. Didn't want to give it to anyone and have them suffer like I have. I tried it for a year. It heats poorly, burns easy, horrible to clean, and just a plain aggravation. I don't swear by non-stick by any means, but this pan probably needs to go that route. I tried using heated Pam, oil, butter, etc.., reducing heat,everything to try and prevent the burning, but to no avail."
4,One of my essential pans...,"This thing is an all-purpose pot/pan that can be used for many things, even from soups to pan frying. It really is a chef's tool.In terms of utility, this ranks at or near the top of my equipment list. It is only slightly less versatile than a proper wok (which is really the Chinese Chef's pan).It's been years now and the thing has held up wonderfully. No issues whatsoever.Be sure to scrub it clean all the time and it will be very stick-resistant (it is no Teflon pan though).Good balance, nice handle. Really, I might wish it were 2-3 cm larger, but it is practically perfect."
3,decent...but go with nonstick,"I ordered the complete 10pc set and this was thrown in as a gift. The size of this skillet is just right and it has a lid. The only complaint i have is that the food sticks, being a health nut the less oil the better. I didnt use oil and paid the price by having the food stick and staining the pan. If you use oil you shouldnt have a problem. Also this stuff is made in China, that could be a bad thing but surprisingly China is making higher quality items recently so it should be alright. Recommendation: go with the cheaper Simply Caphalon line and get the nonstick."
3,Good,It is good to fry and deep fry food. The good part is that it does not have any non-stick feature which is good because of all that we hear of in the news now about the bad effects of using the nonstick cookware. But the only problem is the cleaning when we deepfry. The grease refuses to leave and i am not very sure if we can use tough grease cutting detergents to clean it.
2,"Made in China, and you can tell","This pan is definitely not up to Calphalon standards. Firstly, I was surprised that it was made in China. It still has the lifetime warranty, but I immediately noticed the metal is much thinner than on other Commercial Hard Anodized pieces that are made in Toledo. The most annoying thing is the quality of the anodized finish. The hard-anodized coating on the bottom of my pan is already flaking off, exposing bare aluminum, after about half a dozen uses. The only reason I gave it two stars is the price."
1,Junk,"Food stuck to this like glue. Since it was so cheap at Amazon.com, I just threw it in the trash after a few uses since I didn't want to bother sending it back to Calphalon for adjustment under warranty."
1,Calphalon warranty stinks,"I use the Calphalon hard anodized cookware in my home. Recently we hard boiled eggs. We were unable to clean the pan successfully using the standard cleaners. The only way to get it clean was to use a plastic pad and scrub furiously. After doing this several times the coating began to come off the pan. I returned it to Calphalon expecting a replacement. BUT, they returned the original pan to me. After calling them they stated that I had used an ""unauthorized cleaning technique"" and refused to honor their warranty. I recommend buying All-Clad instead. They know what customer service means!"
1,don't buy it,These are very thin and light. I don't know where they got the idea of pricing it regularly at nighty dollars. Worth only five dollars
1,Terrible,"O stars not available so... Calphalon is marketed well and sticks well. I cook professionally and was drawn to the use of the word in it's promotions ""commercial"". I have also recently seen ratings where it failed and T-Fal my old stuff was at the top. I really do not like it. I must note I sautee alot."
1,Ruined in under 1 day,"All was well until I pulled it out of the dishwasher -- I was stunned to discover this was not dishwasher tolerant. Of course, the booklet points this out, but there should be a bright sticker on the bottom of the pan that warns people who are in a hurry to use their new pan! Into the trash it went, woe is me!"
2,Calphalon Chef's not a safe bet,"Folks, if you're looking for a ""non-stick"" frying pan or skillet, this isn't the one for you. We own several Calphalon pieces, and to date have been happy with thier performance. However, when we recently purchased this item, we were very dissapointed with how it handled the most basic of chores, such as frying scrambled eggs without leaving a mess to clean up. This may be a dud, but if it's not, you need to look elsewhere."
3,disappointed,"I have been happy with all my Calphalon pans, but this one disappoints. Maybe I don't really know how to use this type of skillet, but it seems to be difficult to use. I also have a problem with things burning in this skillet, which I never have to worry about with my other Calphalon."
1,Don't think that I don't use the oil or cook improperly - have done it for years...,But it all my sauces and other stuff I cooked using it - they STICK to the skillet and nothing helps to prevent this. I do NOT think this is a quality product. The surface after washing looks very weird too.One good thing - everything that stuck to it - very easy to remove during wash. Not so easy when on the stove and you're trying to turn your stuff around.
1,What a mess!!,"Even when putting oil into the pan, foods sticks worse than in a regular pan. This doesn't happen with my other Calphalon ""Everyday"" pan. Like the other reviewer with the same problem, I will probably end up throwing mine away as well."
2,Everything instantly sticks even with oil,"I have used this pan several times. I followed the manufacturer's directions by using a small amount of oil, heating the oil before putting the ingredients in. Each time, ingredients instantly sank to the bottom and stuck hard. The pan then has to be soaked for hours, and even now burnt food is stuck to the bottom, possibly forever. Enough said? I don't plan on using the pan now, and count the money wasted."
1,"Do Not Buy, it just stick!!!","This is one of the worst cooking skillet I ever used made by Calphalon. No matter how much oil you put it in, it will stick no matter what you cook! Don't pay this price for something that we think no worth it..."
2,sticky sticky,"to begin with..this pan heats up even and fast. i have a hard anodized circulon non-stick pot, a copper bottom skillet, and this calphalon pan. the heat distribution is excellent, and unlike the copper bottom pan, the calphalon is light and easy to use.BUT, the good stops here. the stick problem is bad, and my stainless steel copper bottom pan sticks less than this calphalon skillet.since it's not a non-stick pan, some sticking is expected, but clean up is just pain. regular soaking over nite will NOT help sometimes.if u cook vegitable and small amount of meat, this pan is good. but never fry egg or cook steak in this pan. avoid anything that will carmalize or contain high sugar.i once cooked some balsamic vinegar mushroom with brown sugar in this pan, and it took me forever to get it clean again since the sugar carmalization litterally stuck to the bottom."
3,First Calphalon disappointmen,"I recently purchased this pan and have used it twice. I am a great fan of Calphalon hard anodized and own several pieces. This pan was my first disappointment. During the second use, I accidently spilled a small amount of oil down the side of the pan. The oil left a permanent ugly stain. I tried everything to get it out without success. It still cooks great but I feel that it is now ruined. I will continue to use it but I am disappointed in it. The pan is great for sauteing small amts of food. If it wasn't for getting this pan at a fantastic price, I would consider mailing it back to Calphalon. The postage to return it would probably cost me more than the pan."
2,Not as good as expected,What can I say! This is my first Calphalon pan that I tried. So disppointed. It sticks. Not easy to clean
2,My error on not reading all the specs,"I am only doing this review so others like me will not make the same mistake I did. I did read other reviews(apparently the wrong ones) and based my purchase on them.If you are one to do this than here is the most important thing......THIS IS NOT NONSTICK........I tried cooking a grill cheese(which had butter on the outsides)sandwich and the bread stuck to the skillet and I gave up.Unfortuately, through my excitement of getting new pans to cook with, I threw the boxes away upon opening."
2,"even a lot of people recommanded this product, but I won't","cz I had much trouble to clean it, and also it isn't stick resistant. Believe it or not, you just try like I did."
2,READ THIS FIRST -- review your needs before u buy it,"I bought this , as it looked cool in the website.First -- Don't buy unless you are single and are makinga one serving of the dish -- it is too small--aLL the food gets spilled on the stove.Second -- It doesn't have the protective coating-- like non stickIt doesn't work if you want to cook on high flameand less oil.You have to compromise on time or fat.Third -- I bought couple of more in the hard anodized -- theyare good for making soups, not stir fry's.Fourth -- I cannot use it for deep fry's as I am scared that itwill spill, as it doesn't have a flat base and is notstable on the stove.Fifth -- I highly recommend the contemporary style that amazonhas -- I use it all the time."
1,Definitely my worst Calphalon,Quality has taken a nose dive recently for Calphalon pans being sold by Amazon. Either they are pushing inventory that is flawed or Calphalon's heydays are over..This pan was a disaster. We cant make anything in it with out food sticking to the pan like @#$% on velcro. And then we spend another 30 minutes getting food off the pan. We hardly use it anymore and I recommend buyers to look elsewhere. We might try to get Calphalon to take it back..
2,Perfect Pan,"Have used this pan almost every day for the past three years. Have not found a reasonable task it is not able to handle well. Heats evenly, handles stir-fry easily. The deep sides keep splatters in the pan and the handle stays cool to the touch. It is not a high volume cooking utensil, but for the chef who likes stove top meal preperation for 2-4 diners it more than holds it's own. It rarely leaves my range top. The pan has held up well and still looks fairly new. It cleans up with little effort. I don't recall the exact price I paid for it, (around $50)but I am ordering another one at this $20 price. If one is perfect, two should be doubly so."
3,This thing is so small,"It's a great little pan, kinda like a miniature wok, but I find it hard to find a dish I can use it for since it's so small. If your cooking for 1 or 2, it's fine for most dishes, but past that, again, too small."
4,it works fine,"this cookware works much the same way as cast iron, as in heating and sticking isn't a problem if you know how to cook. I think all new cookware needs a seasoning time and this is no different. The more I use is the better it seems to work. The only problem I have is that the larger 12"" everyday skillet still isn't here yet. This size is great for cooking for one or smaller quanitities."
1,Not up to Calphalon standards,"I had previously purchased the 5-piece Calphalon Commercial hard-anodized set from Amazon.com at [a] bargain price ...and the 2.5 quart saucepan for [a moderate price]. All US-made,Oustanding quality and value and they will last a lifetime.You can imagine my disappointment when I received the latest addition, the 9"" 2-quart chef's skillet.While it may be a perfectly adequate skillet, as compared to other brands (or even lesser cookware in the Calphalon lines) the construction was not up to Calphalon standards and the gauge of the aluminum is a lot thinner.Also of note: this skillet was made in China, no doubt to cut costs.When I called Calphalon, they indicated that this particular skillet is currently being made in both China and the US. It might make sense to shop around for one that is US-made. The country of origin is on the bottom of the pan and printed on the outside of the box.It is sad when a company undermines its own reputation with products of lesser quality."
3,I love Calphalon....,"and I use this skillet often. The only problem I have with it is the balance. If it isn't full enough, the handle pulls it backwards and the rounded shape makes it sit crookedly on the burner - it's a drag. Get a nice saucier instead."
3,Niche pan,"Bought this because of the price. As it turned out,my wife really likes it for frying small things-shrimp,hush puppies,fritters,etc. Because of the sloped sides and narrow bottom,it is excellent for stir-frying veggies also. Well worththe price."
2,Not what I had hoped,"I had purchased one of the Calphalon non-stick crepe pans, and loved it. After reading about the different pans, I purchased this anodized pan for a specific purpose...to fry chicken. It stuck too much to be of much use. To stir fry something, this pan is fine, but not for fast frying."
2,"Calphalon 9"" skillet","I have quite a few Calphalon hard-anodized pcs. I have been 100% satisfied with all of them. This one I would return in a heart beat except that I realized only after using it that the quality of the pan is questionable. I think the pan is a knock-off. It has made in China, not Toledo, Ohio like all of my other Calphalon pots and the weight of the cover & pan do not match my others. Definitely would NOT order again from this seller."
3,Believe the bad reviews...,"I bougth this skillet in spite of all the bad reviews about it beeing to thin and different in quality from other Calphalon items. Well, I cannot say I wasn't warned... but anyway I thought I'd give it a try. I received it today and if it wasn't because it came in the same box as two books I had ordered, the box would hardly have weighed anything. It's definately thinner than all my other Calphalon pots.The anodized finish looks uneven and spotty on the pan and almost see-through on the lid. I have reviewed some other Calphalon items of chinese manufacture and thought they were equally well made as the Toledo ones, until I got this one. This pan is made in China and I'm keeping it only because the lid fits my Calphalon Comm. 3 qt. pot that came without a lid. I would recommend you believe the bad reviews about this one... not all Calphalons are made equal."
3,Durable but scratches easily,"It's a great little skillet for stir-fries or whatever and is easy to clean. However, it scratches easily, mostly from the pan meeting the lid or when it's resting in the sink."
2,Not Up to Par,"The size and depth of the skillet filled a void in my cooking utensil selection. However, it doesn't have the weight, heat conduction and non-stick values that I've come to expect with Calphalon cookware. Bottom line: It cooks food like a cheap imitation. ."
4,"Great value, excellent pan","Very nice and functional pan. Handle is not the high-quality polished steel that you get on the higher-end Claphalon, but the pan itself (the ""business end"" that really counts) is fist rate."
1,Eggs Stick,"This pan sticks. Doesn't matter how you follow the manufacturer's instructions, put oil, clean it well, no cold food, it still sticks. I've tried all ranges of temp to cook it on and there's no difference. Waste of money, All-Clad makes much better products. I've also used cheap non-stick surfaces and they work much better than this skillet for frying eggs. And it's a pain to clean. I still have not been able to scrub off the oil residue on the edges of my pan."
2,Sticks!,"I have used this pan for about 3 years, part time.It beats a crappy Farberware or similar hands down but don't be fooled so fast about it being a ""luxury"" pan.I have been a witness to Calphalon's declining quality in recent years and this pan is one of those.Food sticks to it easily. I am no stranger to butter and oil and still this pan makes food adhere. I find that it helps to give it a slow and lengthy warm up to the proper temp but i am resigned to just knowing that food sticks to it now.It is a useful size and shape for spontaneous cooking but i recommend going with a true high quality item such as MC2 from All Clad."
3,Great size..but recommend buying the non-stick ones,"I have a whole collection of this Calphalon Commercial Hard Anodized pans. They are wonderful pans and inexpensive. However, if the price are not a big different betweenthe Commercial Hard Anodized Collection and the non-stick ones, I would strongly recommend you to get the non-stick ones. It will definitely make your life much easlier. But other than that, this is a good pan, size is perfect."
3,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed to learn that this Calphalon was manufactured in China and not in Ohio. I felt deceived and have contacted Calphalon. They assured me that the same quality and care is given to the manufacturing process in China as in Ohio. My biggest complaint is that I was not given the option to decline made in china products over the true Calphalon. I have visited other sites since that sell discounted Calphalon and some of them reveal that the product is made in china. It appears that Amazon uses Ohio manufactured Calphalon marketing speak when selling the cheaper quality Calphalon that is sold in stores like Target. In my mind, this is a deceptive marketing practice. I have lost respect for Calphalon and Amazon."
2,intolerably sticking,"Everything sticks to it. And I don't know why. I want to know why. I tried different temperature, different heating time, different food, from vegetables to meats. But no improvement at all."
5,"Excellent, just plain excellent.","This was the first SF book I ever read, and I still have that ragged copy. It's young adult fiction and the characters are very uncomplicated, but it's a fun romp. Buy this book, but if you do, and like it, do yourself a favor: Don't ever read ""The Cat Who Walked Through Walls"" becauase one of the Stones shows up in that book, and it ain't pretty."
5,Classic Sci-Fi Adventure,"This should be in everyone's library. Robert Heinlein is the master of science fiction! I really enjoy reading his works, especially from this modern era perspective."
5,There is just something about this book,"I have to admit this is just about my favorite Heinlein. It is about a family that does some really cool things together like visit Mars and the asteroid belt. They suffer some mishaps and adventures and have a generally great time. I like to think this will be possible one of these days. Too bad I won't live to see it. Like in the Tom Swift series, the family is able to buy supplies and craft that would put NASA under a strain. This juxtaposition of the impossible with the everyday possible is what makes this book both appealing and typically Heinlein. Although a Heinlein ""juvenile"" book I seem to enjoy it now as much as when I first read it many many years ago."
4,Genuine early Heinlein,"This book, published in the UK as ""Space Family Stone"", is fairly typical of the early Heinlein, when were there fresh ideas and fresh characters in each book. After ""Stranger in a Strange Land"" Heinlein never wrote a new book, but only the same book over and over again (different cover, different setting, same characters, same philosophy).Note that indeed Star Trek's ""tribbles"" were lifted from Heinlein's ""flat cats"". Apparently also ""Star Fleet"" was lifted from the ""Interplanetary Patrol"" of Heinlein's ""Space Cadet"". In making ""Star Trek"" the producers went back to the SF classics."
5,Happy Thanksgiving Turkey,"I'm not much on writing reviews so I will be brief. This rack is the best on the market, Why?This rack will hold any bird you can buy. It is non stick so no torn skin. It keeps your bird off fat and juices so it will cook more evenly. You can take stright from the roasting pan your carving board and cover your turkey will foil for about 1 hour to let it rest [the juices will stay in the bird] then place it on the board for carving. lastly soap and water cleanup is a breeze."
2,Rack size too large for pan,"This rack is no doubt a good rack, but it does not fit the pan for which it is recommended. In the future, do not sell this rack with the roasting pan. Find a smaller rack that might fit the pan."
4,Good product,"This is solid and a good size for larger roasts, turkeys etc. The only con I can find is that is is not adjustable in any direction. Not a huge problem and I would buy this again."
4,Easy clean up!,"Love it, cleaned up easily!!! Turkey slid right off easily, made it easy to lift out of the pan. word"
5,Tissue Packs,"These tissues are very sturdy, which some people may not like. But I like the security of knowing that I can use them and they won't fall apart when I sneeze or blow my nose. The small packs fit in my purse easily and they can be used as napkins on the go because they are so sturdy."
1,Oily,"This product did nothing but make my hair look like I had put oil on it. I have fine hair, so perhaps it may work well for thick or very course hair, but after two tries with it, its going into the trash."
1,give me a break!,"If you like Tom Waits, don't waste your money. If you're new to him, might I suggest Rain Dogs, or Nighthawks at the Diner. Whatever you do, don't waste your money. This is definately not Tom Waits"
3,uneven but interesting (for Tindersticks fans),"Making a TW covers album was not a very original idea 'cos many of his songs were sung by mainstream artists (thanks to the royalties, he can record difficult albums without caring about the sales). On ""Step right up"", you can even find a beautiful version of ""Martha"" by Tim Buckley (1973). Most of the artists gathered there belong to the indie scene, even if some are more mainstream, like 10000 Maniacs. Some covers are nice (Drugstore, Pete Shelley, Violent Femmes...) but they rarely get to the level of the originals. And there is few covers from the more creative Island albums like ""Swordfishtrombones"" (too difficult ?) That said, if you're a big Tindersticks fan, you have to buy this compilation : their cover of ""Mockinbirds"" is just incredible."
4,Give it a break :),"Ok Tom waits has his own unique style with dealing with his work. It's not quite the same hearing other people sing his songs. Yet I can't stop listening to this album. It has some duds but the gems are quite beautifull. The opening track really does the song old shoes justice. Ol 55 sounds really nice with a country singer belting out the tune. And mocking bird is really catchy. The rest of the songs are so so but if you appreciate Wait's song writing these song's are a neat way to explore his work in different form. Of course it's like trying to hold a candle up to the sun, but it is a beautifull candle regardless."
3,A disservice to one of America's greatest songwriters.,"I'm kind in giving this disc three full stars. I don't expect exact renditions of an original song when it's being covered. I do expect a little life in the arrangements and a little heart in the playing. The Violent Femmes version of ""Step Right Up"" is pretty bad, but worsened by the liner notes they dared include. Tindersticks reworking of ""Mockingbird"" is an admirable attempt, but the song falls flat.On the other hand, I don't know who Frente! is, but these folks really do justice to ""Ruby's Arms"". Pete Shelley's remake of ""Better off Without a Wife"" is a radical departure from the original Waits, but it hits the spot! There's a couple other cuts on the disc that are good, but sadly most of the bands are as flat as their efforts on this dics."
2,"Borrow it, don't buy it","Ok. For the most part this cd blows, but any Tom Waits fan with a sense of humor will get a kick out of the remake of ""pasties and a g-string."" Not worth buying, but worth hearing nonetheless."
3,worthwhile fun...,"Depending on what kind of tribute person you are... my assessment of this one is some re-working of the material. Personally, I think that's cool. After all, if you wanted the artist to do it the way the original song was... what's the point of buying a tribute album. I got this specifically for the Violent Femmes cover, but had fun with it in general. As a tribute album, I think it's average (or maybe a bit more) fun."
1,"Made by, yet not for Tom Waits fans","It must have sounded like a good idea to these people to cover Tom Waits songs, but the result is terrible and in some cases ridiculous (like Alex Chilton's rendition of Downtown). There are some good bands here, but it seems that only Tom can sing his own songs. Maybe he's just too original to cover."
5,Little Touch LeapPad Library:Stella Songbird,Purchased by grandparent to enjoy with grandchildren. This book very musical and fun that young child can soon learn to enjoy on their own.
5,A new look at Leadership,"Bob Garrow's book combines the most important leadership lessons for great leadership with a fun adventure on a pirate ship. Modern day executives learn leadership principles as they are ZAPPED back in time to spend time on a pirate ship. A fun, fast read. I highly recommend it!"
3,Good Read,"I enjoyed the suspense this booked contained, mixed with an emotional love story... At times I found myself getting a bit emotional. It is a good read and I would recommend it. It gets better as you go along."
4,Very good romantic suspense with disturbing villain,"I really enjoyed this book. The villain was very disturbing and I really felt for the victims and their families. It made me question what the definition of law enforcement's mantra of ""doing our best"". If I was a parent of a missing child, and knowing the horrible things that may happen to them in the hands of their captor, I would expect the people working on the case to be working non-stop 24/7. Of course, that's not realistic. I felt for Steven too, his conflict with the responsibilities of his work and his family but was often quite frustrated at him as I felt that at times he wasn't doing enough, especially when he was distracted with Jenna.Good writing, really allowed you to feel for those affected by the crime, made you fear the villain, feel the conflict and emotions of the characters.This is my first Karen Rose book and was pleasantly surprised."
2,Not her best by far...,"I had read all of Karen Rose's books before I found this one. I was very disappointed in it. The hero made me want to smack him! That, more than any other glaring problems in this book, is the reason it gets 2 stars. I normally don't give reviews--an author went through some serious time to get this book written--but I had to share my opinion on this one. All the other books by Karen Rose have been spectacular---maybe she was having an off-time with this book. Whatever the reason--it only gets 2 stars from me."
4,Yet another goodie..,"Like all of Karen Rose's books, this kept me on the edge of my seat. I love the way there is always a connection with characters from her other works and this adds to the suspense - how are they going to be impacted by another tragedy? Loved the book, it is both atmospheric and terrifying!"
3,Mills and Boone,the story line is long winded and tedious. It reminds me of a Mills and Boone novel and concetrates more on un requited love for the heroine than any sort of serial killer story as billed. I have given it 3 stars which i feel is a kindness.
4,Enjoyable Thriller,"A serial killer is abducting highschool cheerleaders, and murdering them in a gruesome manner. Special Agent, Steven Thatcher is on the case of trying to catch the killer, before he strikes again. Steven has enough troubles of his own, though, as he is a widower, with three children, the eldest of which has been acting in a strange manner, in recent weeks.I found this story an enjoyable and exciting read. What I really like about this author is that she is very good at creating characters that make you want to care about them. In particular, Steven Thatcher, his family, and highschool teacher, Dr. Jenna Marshall, who Steven falls head over heels in love with.This is a good, nailbiting thriller."
5,Can't Put It Down! Great Serial Killer/Love Story,"I am an avid fan of true crime books and events involving forensics. I usually only read non-fiction books, but a friend of Karen Rose told me about his book so she let me borrow it. It is wonderfully written. The characters all have interesting detail and just enough development. The serial killer cupped with the love story was perfect. The love story was not too mushy and scenes were written very well. I could imagine this entire book in my head. Once I got to about the middle of the book I didn't want to stop reading. It was hard to put down. This will definitly not make you fall asleep while reading. This should be made into a movie. I am now going to read ""Don't Tell"", her first book. If any more books by Karen Rose come out in the future I will definitly read it."
2,Disappointing...,"I usually don't write reviews but this time I felt I had to.1st I did not buy this book but picked it up in a hostel while I was back packing thinking it would be full of suspense, scary stuff and I would be glue to it until the end (which is what I look forward to when I read a book)... what a disappointment!The author spends more time on the relationship of the special agent in charge than on the actual investigation on the serial murders. Shame. Remove all the love story stuff and you end up with probably half the book worth reading.If you do want to read really good crime/suspenses/keep_you_glued_story try out Jack Kerley's books. Those really kept me going until the last page.P-"
3,Pretty Good,"Well, this book was pretty good. It is some what intense and has a scary villain. Again K. Rose starts romance to fast and has character's hot, heavy and In Love way too soon, that's a big negitive in her writing. Otherwise, this book keeps you reading and quite scared. K. Rose's villains are always creepy and they really piss you off. Which is a good thing, I will admit I was checking the windows and doors several times while reading both her books."
1,Almost a bigger waste of time than the main textbook.,"It almost seems as if the authors of the book couldn't work their own problems. i have no idea how they choose which problems they do-- they only do the odd-numbered problems, and even not many of those! They don't explain each step, only referring you back to the textbook, which itself is useless and incomprehensible.Don't bother."
5,Pressure Drop,"Well I'm not a kid, but M. Fantino, The Specials didn't influence The Clash on Pressure Drop. Toots and the Maytals did, seeing as how Pressure Drop is actually a Maytals song, not a Clash song. Just a heads up.p.s. Check the Maytals out, they rock my skull."
1,rather average album,i have to say that this album is rather average than something amazing - i`m slightly dissapointed tho :(
4,All time classic,"I first heard of the Specials when I saw the video for Gangsters on MTV (yeah, back when it wasn't a shill for popular music's worst). There was a great independent record store in my hometown and when I asked was immediately handed this album. I haven't had a turntable in years so getting this on CD was like hearing it for the first time all over again. This is a disc that makes you want to dance. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is that my original LP had Gangsters right after Too Much Too Young whereas this release does not contain that song as a track on the disc but only as a bonus video. It may be that this follows the original UK release rather than the one I got in the USA way back when. I was a bit disappointed by that but still, if you even think you've heard ska, you haven't heard it until you've heard this. It's a must have."
5,Classic,"In the age of 3rd wave ska, when many people hear the word ""ska"" they say, ""Oh, Less Than Jake!"". While Less Than Jake is quite good (though a ripoff of the lesser known band Slapstick), 3rd wave ska seems to be anything but ska.For most people that want loud music with a Reel Big Fish-esque horn section, this album is not for you. For anyone that digs reggae or any first wave ska, you MUST get this album. CLASSIC ska songs on here such as ""Message To You Rudy"" are a must have. Other great songs include ""Stupid Marriage"" and ""Nite Club"". Heck, all the songs are great! Why are you still reading this? GO OUT AND BUY THE CD!!!!!!!!! You won't regret it. If you don't like it right away, do yourself a huge favor and keep spinnin' it, it will grow on you. STAY RUDE."
5,Collection sees a song my grandpa wrote released domestically for the first time.,"There's not much to say about the song selection that others haven't already covered. Simply put, it's excellent. One thing that made this essential for me, however, was the song ""East Side West Side"" which Ruffin recorded in 1966 as his intended follow-up to ""What Becomes of the Broken-Hearted"" but due to an argument with Berry Gordy, only ended up released in Australia until this was put together. My grandpa, Ron Welser, wrote the song with Terry Johnson, later of Flamingos fame. Further arrangements called for a third songwriting credit in the liner notes, but it's still all of my grandpa's lyrics there. I recommend listening to the entire collection, but why not that one first?"
3,Nice collection,"I think Motown didn't quite know where to put Jimmy Ruffin. They already had Marvin and Smokey as the romantic leads, and Levi and the younger brother Ruffin, David, as the soul men. So, they stuck him with a lot of lyrical material only a few of which (""What Becomes of the Brokenhearted,"" ""I've Passed This Way Before"" and ""I'll Say Forever My Love,"" ) were truly worthy of his talents. What's most interesting in this collection is to see how Ruffin handles songs made more popular by others (""Gonna Give Her All the Love I've Got,"" also done by the Temptations; ""I Gotta Let You Go,"" by Martha Reeves & the Vandellas; ""Lucky, Lucky Me"" by Marvin Gaye among others.) And, listen to how Motown producers used tracks from other songs behind lyrics for new songs. Jimmy Ruffin is a great singer. He deserved better."
2,Fine for basics.,"While I think this book has some good general topics and it is obvious a lot of work went into it, I was very disappointed in the information included. By its name, I expected it to be gardening topics tailored to Long Island - descriptions of all the native plants, historical information, specific soil conditions, bug problems, differences in climate conditions from the north to south shores, and the like. Don't expect to see this at all. It is a nice gardening book, but the information in it you can find anywhere."
2,Very disappointing,"If it weren't so massive, this might be a decent beach read. Unfortunately, while Fischer's efforts to explore how notions of ""liberty"" and ""freedom"" have evolved in the US is admirable, the result is very disappointing -- the book is diffuse and often superficial. Organized into thematic ""episodes"" rather like an episode of ""60 Minutes"" (maybe he doesn't have much confidence in his readers' powers of concentration), Fischer calls this a ""visual history."" Lots of illustrations but little analysis of these as evidence -- in particular he fails to demonstrate any informed or coherent knowledge of the intentions of the artists and designers. Factual errors abound and, especially towards the end, the writing is repetitive and superficial. A good editor might have been able to rescue this overly-ambitious tome from failure."
2,Paint chipped during first use,For the price I expected these blocks to hold up better then they did. Ours had paint chips missing after the first time my son used them. (I guess I expected them to be like our wood toys that use vegetable dyes since the colors were similar.)
3,Isn't this product supposed to come in/with a wooden box?,I have seen this product in the stores and it came with a wooden box for the cubes to be stored in...I'm not sure if this is somehow different but mine did not come with a wooden box?
5,One of my favorites,"I read this book about a year back and absolutely loved it. The woman who wrote it is actually my stepmothers' cousin. I am not a book worm and it takes a certain book to capture me, but this had what it took to keep my attention. I love it!"
2,multi-sensory expedition into angst of boy damaged by family,"The reader is constantly drawn by visual images, pop culture sounds, common Texas references, and bizarre maternal memories into the life of Seegar as a graduating senior in the summer of 1987. His life, and his reckoning with gay/straight reality, beckon you into an attempt to empathize and understand this generation and its angst."
1,"Sloppy writing, sloppy plot","I don't understand the praise for 'Execution, Texas: 1987'. I was bored by the characters, bored by the plot, and bothered by the lack of execution. The author keeps teasing us with tidbits of personality and introspection but leaves us hanging without any true insight. None of the characters were well drawn. This book reminded me lot of 'The Mysteries of Pittsburgh' and 'Getting Off Clean' -only those books were good."
4,Back to High School,"This could almost have been my story. I felt that it was a good book & very easy to read. Some of the things that the main character delt with is what so many gay teens deal with, questions, questions, questions. This book doesn't answer any of the questions, but at least it makes some of them more interesting. I finished this book in an afternoon and felt it was worth reading. Go at it from a semi-light hearted point of view and you'll enjoy it & don't try to make it more than it is or you'll put it down fast."
4,HP black ink cartridge,"This HP ink cartridge has worked well for us. With moderate use, it has lasted five months. Sometimes these re-manufactured catridges do not work well at all. Always glad when I get a good one."
3,"OK, but I prefer the white tape","Zareba RSW660HD 660-Foot Heavy-Duty Electric Fence Black-and-Yellow Poly WireWe usually use 1/2-inch white plastic tape, with wires interwoven, for electric fencing. Strong, visible, easy to manage with a good spooler. I tried this Zareba poly wire for comparison. Breaks more easily, harder to tie repairs together effectively, and harder to manage (stiffer). It's not defective, but I won't buy it again."
5,Shepard Does it Again,"William Shepard has done it again; he's turned out another Robbie Cutler page-turner. Murder on the Danube tells two stories, one from the past and one current. Shepard masterfully weaves both tales together. His diplomatic detective Cutler must solve a murder committed during the 1956 Hungarian Revolution. I love books that teach me about history in such a way I feel as if I were there. After reading Murder on the Danube, I have a greater appreciation for this time in history. Now I have added another place on my must-travel list. Shepard does an excellent job in describing this intriguing setting. Check it out and see for yourself!"
5,exciting Iron Curtain thriller with a twist,"Wow! The first work of fiction from the author of the real-life Consular Tales gives us a fast-paced history/mystery set in modern Budapest with breathtaking flashbacks to the harrowing hours of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, told through the eyes of a group of students who took part. The surviving Freedom Fighters are now successful businesspeople, and are gathering to meet for the first time in 35 years. But before they can do so, one is murdered - by sabre! It falls to likeable Foreign Service officer Robbie Cutler to investigate. Suspense and human interest combine in a thoroughly exciting tale. The author is a career foreign service officer, and he knows his ground. I'm impressed. Could this be the start of a series?"
1,Just Awful,"The first 50 pages are just about impossible to read...and it manages to get worse. Unlikeable characters, stilted dialogue, tedious details, implausible plot twists -- this book has it all. I actually wanted all the characters to get murdered!But, what do you really expect from a vanity press?"
4,Good Biography Silhouetted Against the Backdrop of History,"It is precisely because of the ""idiosyncracities"" of the subject that jazzes this excellently written volume and sets it apart from the more generalized biographies of Hitler's henchmen authored by Peter Padfield and others. It is of course impossible to separate these men from the events of World War II, and most historians do not attempt it. Thus,the spate of biographies of Goebbels, Himmler, et. al., appearing in recent years are more generalized histories of World War II; tactics, politics, etc; than a close exploration into the inner workings of self, and environmental factors that drove these individuals into Hitler's orbit. Mr. Irving does a better job of unmasking the man that was Hermann Goring than most, and manages to capture the essence of the man against the larger themes of war, the Holocaust, and the mad delusions of the Third Reich."
3,They work well,"My kids are 2 and 3 years old but don't really get how to use these. However, I use them when they break out all their instruments. I like them."
1,what happened?,"We ordered 5 castanets last October for $1 each - now they are $4.95 each? Why in the world would they increase in price so much?My husband actually uses these for his employees in his office, and asked me to buy more for him. At $5 a pop, I will be looking somewhere elseETA: I found them online elsewhere for $1 each; I will be purchasing them there!"
3,my kids don't play with it,I bought a bunch of horner music items for my young kids but they never play with this. i guess they need to be older than 3 and 1 to appreciate what it does but it's just okay. the quality is well made.
5,They're perfect,"This little plastic guys do just what they are supposed to. Order a half dozen or so and everyone can ""click"" away together."
4,...,"I agree with the rebuttals to the original review...the book is not marked ""Very Basic Songs for the Beginner,"" it is rather assumed that the person has SOME musical experience, and the CD would provide accompaniment to aid in learning the piece. You do not have to be a 'professional singer' to plunk out the tune; everyone I know has found this book to be extremely useful, and it is worth the price."
4,Great resource for beginners,"These books are a great resource for voice teachers and young singers. I knocked off one star because some of the songs only offer the English transliteration of the text. But they do have good selections for introductions into English, German, French and Italian, and they even have a few Spanish. I use this and the 24 Italian Art Songs in my class nearly every day to teach high school aged singers."
3,"Good book, and on time shipping",I have a voice studio and I always like this series of books. I have a mezzo and the soprano and I like those ones as well.
2,I hope you can read sheet music,"What a crock. I'm not a professional singer. I used to sing back in school and I still sing for pleasure. I was looking for a book/cd combo that I could sing along with to help me strengthen my voice. I've used a lot of Hal Leonard books over the years for several different instruments and this is the first book that didn't come with a companion cd/cassette of the exercises in the book. Of course the companion cd can be purchased separately which doubles the cost. Ok, so I buy the companion CD. There's no vocals on the cd, just piano. I guess if you're a professional singer that can read the sheet music in the book then you're ok. If you can read sheet music then you really don't need the CD. If you can't read sheet music then you're out of luck. I used to have a high opinion of the Hal Leonard series but it's really taken a nose-dive with this offering."
4,"excellent, complete album performed by experienced jazzmen","I was very happy when swing became popular again, having grown up on Glen Miller, Benny Goodman, and Duke Ellington. I stumbled onto this album while looking for IRON BUTTERFLY, and I have completely fallen in love with it. The music reminds me more of the old-fashion swing, while still being current. The group can rock out when it wants to, but it is not afraid to go soft and slow once in a while. Plus, I think Johnny Boyd has an excellent voice, much better than the other big swing bands."
5,I don't give 5 stars very often...,"but I really enjoed this CD, listening to it over and over and over. I've always like intrumental Swing, but found vocals on most tracks to be lacking something....not here! I enjoyed every song, especially the up-tempo tunes. Very good value"
5,Indigo Swing's the real deal!,"Indigo Swing is not only one of the best swing bands to listen to, they are the greatest guys. My band, GABARDINE SWING, opened for them in Omaha, Ne. These guys are down to Earth and understand swing. It was a true honor to open for them. Namely because thier show inspired me to get a band together. So I guess that makes them Grandfathers to my music. Congrats boys, it's a swing band. Keep swingin' Johnny!"
2,Sanitized Swing,"I purchased this CD based on the reviews I read here, and man, am I ever disappointed! You want some more adjectives? Sterile, repressed, constrained--all seem to fit the bill. Give me something a little more down and dirty, please! It did occur to me that maybe they are better live--I sure hope so. I'd never met a swing CD I didn't want to dance to until I met this one."
2,*Gag*,The only thing good about them these days is just the piano player who can play some good boogie woogie. As for Johnny...I know how he hates those bright lights in his precious face...hope he gets over his ego trip. Johnny...did you forget about the dancers??? OH no...its all about the money...my bad.
3,Could be better...,"Good band (and cd), but the vocals are weak. I would consider buying their next release if they had a different vocalist."
5,This one fires on all cylinders,"Smoothest swing you'll hear. Every, yes, every track on this lp is solid. That alone sets it apart from those one track wonders gathering dust in my collection. Dance, reflect, swoon---this captures all the moods evoked by great swing bathed in a jazzy blues sound that this group owns all to itself. All lyrics printed on jacket and the band writes most of its own stuff. A 90's product with all the technical superiority that implies plus loyalty to the roots of the music they have updated on this truly five star collection. Enjoy."
4,Excellent swing album,"This is the second album from the San Francisco based swing sextet, featuring their new line-up (permanent guitarist, and a new drummer and upright bass player). Although I miss some of the more energeic covers that graced their first album, this is still a teriffic effort, with original standouts ""Regular Joe"" (played with the Bill Elliot Swing Orchestra) ""What's the Matter Baby"" and ""How Lucky."" And they finally found a space for their perennial personal number, ""Baron Plays the Horses,"" written about their sax player (the musical backbone of the band). Johnny Boyd still has the best singing voice in swing jazz, embarassing just about every other band's front man -- just compare him to the intolerable screech of ""Cherry Poppin's Daddies"" and you'll realize what a sublime pleasure a practiced, unified jazz band can be."
3,too clumpy,"The cranberries seem to be ok, but they look like they are not for snacking out of the bag, but for cooking. Some of the berries are nice, but some are squished, and those are clumped in big nasty chunks. It is OK to use those for cooking, for sauteed meat, for example, but you don't want to eat this as is. I like that they are packed in relatively small pouches, as this is much more convenient."
1,This game isn't that good,"This game isn't that good. Gnasty Gnorc doesn't look like how he should(spyro 1 design), Red looks like and over grown color changed spyro(color changing cheats for spyro 2 and 3), Moneybags is still around with his own shop no less, the breathe power ups stink(what happened to the good old super flame power up?),you have to collect light gems to unlock power ups(seriously.The super charge power up had always be free in the first 3 spyro games), They don't have the original dragon elders that you had to rescue in Spyro 1, They changed the name headbash to horn dive(stupid name for the headbash),unlimited amount of gems which is stupid since the original three never had that making it worth while in those games to collect gems, gems had more detail and were shinyer,because of this stupid game most people nowadays have never even heard of the original spyro games."
4,fun but bad graphics,"I've played other Spryo games, and this one is very similar to the others. It's a little different because it's older, but still fun. The graphics are a little shotty (again, beacuse it's not brand new) but they're completely tolerable. If you're a fan of Spyro games, this would be a fine addition to your collection."
4,Great!,"I use the Hoya UV filters primarily for lens protection, but it does offer nice lighting enhancements. It's a no-brainer purchase."
5,Good product.,I bought two HOYA 52mm UV Haze Protection Filter for my two lens. I'll recommend it to everyone.
5,my kids were riveted. I couldn't peel them away from the set,Awesome! The best kids exercise video yet. And Non-violent! Just grea
4,Good quality knife.,"I've been very happy with this knife, but before you buy, think about it. A 12 inch knife is a LONG knife! This knife actually protrudes out the back of my knife block."
2,Too small,"The hot pack inserts in the warming mittens are too small. They only cover the back of the hand and not the usually more painful thumb and thumb joints (closer to the wrist) of someone who suffers from painful arthritis of the hands. A good idea, but the insert packs need to be extended to generously cover the thumb area and to extend lower down to the wrist."
3,hand warmers not what I thought,I have arthritis and I thought these would help but they are a little bulky and don't get very warm. Ok if I am just sitting with them. It is easier to use heat pad
1,Mine Stink Too!,"""JR"" (previous reviewer) & I must have gotten our mittens from the same batch. I bought a pair for my husband for Christmas, but he refuses to use them due to the smell. I have to agree. They smell fine until they are heated, then the smell actually makes me sick to my stomach. I'm now experimenting with making my own inserts in the hopes I can get the husband to use the mittens without the smell. The company who makes these really needs to check on this issue, unless there was just a bad batch. In which case, ""JR"" & I need to get replacement inserts!"
3,heats top or bottom of hands not both,removable bag o beans is handy.but best solution is microwaveable material or lining. it works but not well. would be handt 2 have left n right gloves identified ie colours
2,Stinky!,"They do what they're supposed to, however, the smell really put me off - very chemical. The heat doesn't last very long, either. :("
2,dangerous for burns,This product is not what I thought. It has a large bundle of ??? on top of the glove that heats up and therefore only burns the top of the hand. I would not recommend this product.
5,Best original blues rock band today!,"If you haven't seen them or heard them, seek a live performance SOON! This is the best Texas has to offer -- soulfoul, effortless, singing and guitar playing. They rock! I saw them at Lucy's in Austin and at the Satellite Lounge in Houston. Great song writing, rock ballads that deliver, and awesome slide playing! These guys will make you dance and shout. Look for this band, or check out their CD. I know you'll agree that they rock your socks off!"
3,Texas Blues Rock at its best!,"On their second CD, Medicine Hat, Sunset Heights delivers some of the best Texas Blues Rock ever. Sure, it may sound a bit like Stevie Ray or Ian Moore and maybe a little of Breedlove thrown in, but the bottom line is it's pure Rockin' Blues. True to their sound, you'd swear these guys are from Austin. Surprise! This exciting sound is coming out of Houston. Listen to ""Memory Lane"", ""Drift Away"", ""Workin' Man Pt. 3"" and the title track, ""Medicine Hat."" All in all, it's a great piece of work."
3,Very good for modellers...,"If a picture is worth a thousand words, then the Walk Around of the Tomcat is priceless for the Tomcat afectionado.The pictures, mostly B&W, but some great color, covers every aspect of the Tomcat in great depth. All the varients of Grummans superlative fighter are covered as well, notably with pictures of the differences.If you are a modeller in particular who is into superdetailing, or just a fan of aircraft or F-14's, then I recommend this book. If you are looking for a more general overview of the Tomcat, then save your money for a book more along this line."
3,"""Best Of Yesterday Today & Tomorrow"" Review!","If you've never heard of E-40 then you probably don't know about as much about West Coast rap as you'd like to think. Contrary to popular belief, most of the slang that Snoop Dogg made popular was actually borrowed from Forty. The Bay area icon has come up with some of the most inventive methods of speech ever and this ""greatest hits"" collection offers up some of the finest work in his career. Classics like ""Rapper's Ball"" and ""Captain Save a H**"" are excellent choices but a number of Forty's hottest joints (""Nah Nah"", ""Dusted & Disgusted"") are noticeably absent. Four new unreleased songs make for a nice touch but this CD feels more like a preview of his work than a career retrospective. With close to a dozen albums in his catalog, Jive should have strongly considered making this ""greatest hits"" album a two-disc project."
3,"OK, but...","The shades do a good job of helping keep my car's internal temperature down while it's parked, but I STRONGLY suggest you remove them before driving. The white color makes them difficult to see through. Another option is that, if you're using them for the front-side windows, undo the lower suction cup & roll the windows down so you can see out."
3,Last Dragon Chronicles,I have read two of this series and find that they are hard to follow; are very slow and drawn out.
5,Loved it!,"My daughter, who's 8, loves this series! Dragons are her favorite mythical creatures and she says these books are ""mysterious and thrilling""! As a parent it is a wonderful thing to find books that your kids can't wait to read. Thanks to Chris d'lacey!"
5,Awesome,"I absolutely love this book. It was written well, and all the twists and turns made me never want to put the book down! The only thing that I disliked, was the fact that David possibly died. Overall AMAZING. Right about to download the next book!"
2,Fire Star by Chris D'Lacey,Cover of book was torn and binding of the book was torn as well. Some of the pages inside were badly wrinkled as if someone was trying to tear them out. Was not real happy with the condition of this book!
5,Fire Star is a great story,We received the fourth of these books as a gift and after reading it had to have the first three. This one is very well written and enjoyable.
4,Incredible Story!,"(written by 9 yr old reviewer)Fire Star is an incredible story about witches clashing with humans, hurt polar bears, and a kidnapped girl. Read this enchanting story by Chris D'Lacey.The author ends one of the chapters with a witch luring a landlady's daughter into the world of coldness. And it makes the reader want to read more.In the book, one of the characters meets up with a polar bear who is fighting with the character's girlfriend!An Eskimo goes to his dad to stay with him for a week. When he is there with his father, an evil spirit comes into his father's house and haunts all of the family.I loved the book for the journey but some of the words didn't always fit into the story. I think kids 9-12 would like this book, Fire Star, by Chris D'Lacey. I hope they do."
2,Fire Star,"Dear Readers,""Fire Star"" is the third book in the Last Dragon Chronicles. The book is about David Rain, a college student who goes on a research trip to the arctic. As soon as he's there, he starts writing a book about bears, dragons, and the Inuit people. As he writes, he finds out his story is becoming true.If you were planning to buy this book, we (Yakob and Kennan) would say that it is not a good idea. We would give this book 3/5 or even 2/5 if we were rating it. Why? The answer is: this book is not well organized. The story does not run as smoothly as in the first two books. The transitions between the chapters are all over the map. There is also another reason: The main character dies. This is crazy because we don't know how Chris D'Lacey will be able to continue the series without the main character in ""The Fire Eternal"", ""Dark Fire"", or ""Fire World"". Yet we know David has a child. The next book has the child being very young and the story line continues like that.Kennan and Yakob"
3,Jurassic Boobs,"While Frank Cho's art delivers, his story does not. The plot is prosaic, the dialog weak and the characters stereotypical and one dimensional. I have never reviewed a bad book for Amazon but this one comes close.Having said that, if I had it to do over, I'd buy this book again.Why? Because of the art. I am not immune to feminine pulchritude but there is more than that here. There are dinosaurs. Man-eating, body-chomping predators.And of course there is Shanna.Frank Cho is one of a handful of artists who can make the female form high art but (there's always a but) I actually got tired of having boobs in my face...and not any boobs - huge, collossal, magnificent boobs. In fact, they are so prevalent that it seemed like subliminal messaging...""We're in great danger here (boobs)...we could be killed (boobs)...you get the idea.Still, I did buy it and I am glad - but not for the boobs. Seriously.If I was 15 again I'd probably give it 5 stars."
5,Great read!,"Interesting and great book about the founder of America's wine industry. He truly had ""wine making"" in his heart and soul and shared it with all of us."
1,Worst book I've read in a year.,"Very disapointing book especially considering the rave reviews from Amazon customers. The writing was terrible and very repetitive. What little I learned about the wine industry was overshadowed by my increasing dislike for the author who despite his efforts to paint himself as hero, struck me as a shmuck who abandoned his family, left his longtime wife/partner and seemed more interested in self promotion then the promotion of the wine industry in California. Such an awful book that despite the fact I bought a hardcover..I won't pass it on to my friends."
2,disappointed,"Reading the specifications Amazon says you can use this product inside the large roasting pan. To my dismay I purchased the large professional nonstick 12 x 17 Bake/roast pan and the cooling rack does not fit inside. Calphalon calls this product a cooling/roasting rack, should be called a cooling rack. The cooling rack is just a little to big, I'm not sure what large roasting pan this fits into but buyer beware."
5,Very pleased with this cartridge,"I just got my Dl-110...installation was much easier than expected even though I had never really balanced a cartridge before. I did use a protractor and force gauge, though. The cartridge sounds better with each listen. Very clean sound, even on less than clean lps...it tracks very well and eliminates a lot of noise. Warm sounding and evenly balanced. I'm not using a mc phono stage, just phono input on a silver face Marantz receiver...volume is actually louder than the old mm cartridge I had before, an NAD. the price of the Denon made it an attractive choice and I also like that it is somewhat of an atypical cartridge from what you usually come across these days. Much better than a stock cartridge or cheap alternative."
2,Base leaks,"After using it for 2 weeks the base started to leak. There are no cracks and the glass is strong, it looks like the leak is coming from where the gasket is. I will try to find a replacement gasket and we'll see if it still leaks."
4,Fits and works well,"I broke the glass blender jar on my old Oster Kitchen center. This is a combo food processor, mixer and blender.I was afraid that I wouldnt be able to find a replacement and was happy to find this on Amazon's website. It fitsand works well. It is plastic and very light weight but does its job. No problems."
1,Not as described. This is NOT the Oster brand and will NOT fit.,"I received my item from thepartsbiz. It was the worst online buying experience I've ever had. This item is crap and does not fit Oster models. It won't sit on the blender base all the way and barely works. The lid does not fit the glass jar and they are two different brands. I received the blender set USED with grime and rust on it! To top it off, I ordered two different blenders from the same company. This one was generic and less expensive. The other had a different picture and claimed to be the actual Oster brand. The company sent me this crappy one which was not as described at all and doesn't look like the photo. I had to email them multiple times to get the second one and they were incredibly rude. Finally the replacement was a duplicate of this crappy blender and NOT the second Oster brand that I paid more for. They are refusing to correct their mistake or issue the difference."
2,Cheap Low Quality,"For almost $20 including the shipping I expected more. I ordered this because I dropped my glass one that came with the blender on the tile floor, shattering it. The whole blender new was $35 and I would have just gone and got another had I known what I'd be getting."
3,Not as good as the original,"I don't mind this, but my wife hates it. She says it is loose and wobbely when running, and the lid does not fit right. Plus the plastic is cheap. But is it worth paying the extra for a glass replacement? That is the question."
1,Leaky,The threads on the base plastic cap are very low quality and I have never been able to securely attach the base so it doesn't leak. I am a very mechanically inclined person and spent a great deal of time trying to get it to seal up.. no go!The unit also does not sit down all the way in my blender base.
4,This really works on sore or tight muscle,This works really well on sore and tight muscles and it opens up the sinuses at the same time. The bottle was a bit small however so next time I'll go a lot bigger.
3,"First Bottle - Great, Second Bottle - Rancid?","The first bottle I purchased worked wonders on my stuffy nose...no doubt. After running out, I ordered another bottle, but this time, the smell was horrible. Not sure what the difference is, but being oil, could this simply be an old batch that's gone rancid?I'm a little leary of purchasing another bottle...maybe that horrible smell is the right smell, and my first bottle was the ""off"" bottle."
4,the joe louis story,well written bio of the great boxer--possibly the greatest heavyweight of all time---some of the photos included should have been edited betteran easy to read format and this soft cover version is very portable
5,GREAT stuffed animal,"I bought mine about 10 years ago, it was in Top condition, but i recently Lost it while i Moved out.I dont mind paying $68 for a new one.Great stuffed animal, adorable. ""Pookie"" was my bestfriend as a child.Thank you TY!"
4,Soft & cute puppy!,"I bought this puppy for my son when he was one. When I got it, I found out that the eyes were these little black button eyes that I didn't feel were safe to be put in the crib with him in case he would have chewed on it. They've never come lose or anything, but I bought it thinking they were the same thread sewn eyes as the Ty kitty my daughter had received as a gift when she was younger (which has now become her lovie). This puppy is the prefect size to be held & hugged by little ones & it's great that it's machine washable!"
3,Va Va Voom.....,"Looks great and feels awesome. Wish Amazon had the matching bra on here to avoid finding a match. Not the support expected, but definitely slims."
1,Huckster!,"I've read about 50 books on hypnosis and NLP. D.A. Brady's book is, by far, the most disappointing. The book was written poorly with grammatical errors throughout. If you are looking for that one book to read about hypnosis...look anywhere other than ""Hypnosis and the Power of Positive Thinking"" by D.A. Brady."
2,Pretty useless,I thought it might be more helpful but it's usefulness was rather limited. It's be tough to make a hard copy of something like this work well. It's certainly not comprehensive.
3,Another good album from a new band to me,"I am actually repeating my review from Ode to Joy, another Deadly Snakes album, as my comments there are relevant to this album.I first purchased the Deadly Snakes' album Love Undone and was immediately very taken with their loud raucous and very great brand of rock n roll. So much so that I bought their 3 other albums, including this one. While it's not as loud or rocky or with the terrific tunes of Love Undone, it's still a pretty good album. I do like it, but as far as my likes in music go, I don't like it as much as that album.To be perfectly honest, if I had bought this album first, I probably wouldn't have bought the others. Still, plenty to like here, I just won't compare it to Love Undone.Don"
5,Structures: Or Why Things Don't Fall Down,"Absolutely a must read for anyone interested in how the world works. Gordon paints a great, timely picture of the physics and engineering of structures in such a clear, fascinating style. I have read and reread this book over the years, never get tired of it!"
4,Very interesting book,I bought this book translated into Spanish. (Ediciones Celeste)ISBN 84-8211-190-6.I'm Civil (Structural) and Industrial engineer. I found this book with a different vision of our profession. Gordon wants to answer why the things are stable.
3,Eccentric,"At times I was annoyed by Mr Gordon's style - this is the work of a real old-world engineer. The little anecdotes he scatters through the work where so-and-so told him something, or it was rumoured that professor somebody said this, or 'I have heard it claimed that.....' annoyed me with their hearsay quality and lack of verifiability.But then there are some very interesting discussions that do make the book an interesting introduction to engineering and the structure of things. I just would have preferred if it read less like an engineer had written it!"
2,TEDIOUS READING,"I'M PROBABLY THE ODD MAN OUT ON THIS ONE BUT I HAD TROUBLE WADING THROUGH THIS BOOK..IN FACT I THOUGHT THE WRITING STYLE WAS GROPING AND STUMBLING AT BEST. WRITING ABOUT STRUCTURES IN SIMLPE TERMS IS A TOUGH TASK INDEED AND I'M NOT SURE GORDON HAS SUCEEDED HERE. I FOUND THE BOOK TO BE A REAL ""YAWNER"".FOR MY MONEY I WOULD BUY SALVADORI'S BOOKS OVER THIS. SALVADORI HAS A KNACK FOR MAKING THE SUBJECT TRULY GRIPPING READING. HIS BOOKS HAVE A MUCH MORE PRACTICAL BENT, AND IMHO THEY ARE WRITTEN MUCH BETTER, NOT TO MENTION THE ILLUSTRATIONS ARE TOP GRADE. TRY STRUCTURE IN ARCHITECTURE OR WHY BUILDINGS STAND UP.THE 2 STARS ARE FOR GORDON'S DISCUSSION OF STRESS AND STRAIN, THE BEST PART OF THE BOOK FOR ME."
2,Didn't do it for me,"Sorry, but this book just didn't do it for me. I just got back from 3 weeks on Maui, staying with locals. Most of the available trails are indeed in the book, but the maps and descriptions are sometimes wrong or simply out of date. With today's technology, there's no excuse for hand-drawn ""not to scale"" maps. For the next revision, I'd suggest that the author go through the entire book, synchronize it with reality and bring it up to the same quality level as other guide books. If you're interested in some hikes that aren't in this book, see the hiking section of the excellent guidebook ""Maui Revealed""."
2,Needs a major upgrade,"I have to agree with the other reviewers about the format of this book. My biggest issue with the book is that the maps are nothing more than what appear to be pencil sketches inserted into the hike descriptions. Very amateurish and not detailed enough. There's also a table at the beginning of the book that tries to summarize various characteristics of each hike, but it's too hard to read: it crams too much information into the table and the entries on each line don't exactly line up. Turning the table to landscape, using Excel-like technology to produce a crisp table and expanding some of the abbreviations would make it far more useful. This book won't be taking up space in my suitcase on my upcoming trip. Time to research another one."
1,Did NOT look like the picture,I received this tongue ring and it looks nothing like the picture. It is very light and just looks clear with glitter in it. VERY disappointed.
3,Paradise a nice place to be,"Musically, John Pederson's latest offering is a strong production full of very tasty guitar work, exemplary keyboard technique, and percussionary tactics, you wouldn't normally find in this genre of music. I highly recommend this because of the varied styles that are prevalent, all contained in a neat little package full of big surprises, all 13 tracks seem to flow very well together and rather then describe them, it is now in your hands to purchase this CD and make your own conclusion..........so, get it!"
3,STOP.......Not quite up to par,"The book is well illustrated and has some interesting recipes, but if you are looking for a grilling book, this is not it. There are recipes for deserts and salads. Only a small number of recipes for burgers, chickens or steaks. I believe less than 20 total.....I highly recommend Burger Meisters by Marcel Desauliner which is the best burger book around.Also ""Hot Barbeque"" for other barbeque recipes."
5,"Excellent Book,!","This book has wonderful color pictures, excellent recipes and it is a steal at this price. So far the recipes have been awesome. Five stars!"
5,Best Book - Even for Charcoal Grill,"Best book out there by far. Bought it for my dad for Christmas 1999. Since then we've all bought a copy for each other.Other reviewers were displeased because of the heavy gas grill reference in the introduction. Don't let that fool you. Us charcoaling purists can regulate temperature as well - the final output is incredible. (Use this book in conjunction with your Weber Intro. book included with your purchase - great reference for # of coals to use for indirect & direct heat as well as meat temperatures and average time on grill).Instructions are easy to follow and produce high quality meals. The wine or beer recommendations for each meal are right on target. The garlic mint turkey, mustard/honey glaze salmon, and North Carolina-style pork barbecue are beyond this world and a blast to cook.I wouldn't pass on this one - it's worth it."
4,Excellent Gift idea for the BBQ lover,I bought this as a gift for my brother who loves to BBQ. He loved it
1,Weber's Art of the Grill,The jacket cover was scratched and did not look new. I had to remove it to give as a gift.
2,"Nice for a while, but......","For a while, at least, it was been a nice machine; a good introduction to making espresso at home. After about 3 years, I have to join those who are disappointed with this machine. In the last several months it's progressively deteriated. Sometimes it manages to successfully pump water through the grounds, sometimes not; the portofilter sometimes will not hold pressure; and lately whenever it's heated for steaming,large amounts of steam stream out of the brew area. Time to shop for another machine."
3,It's a gamble.,"I have owned one of these machines for five years. When it works, it can produce a good pull. However, you need to know what you are after and experiment until you can reproduce what you want. Service provided for the machine is poor. I have had mine serviced twice and both times it was returned poorly repaired. Briel's customer service is non-existent as far as I could discover. I had to have it serviced locally, but they can't get parts so they made do. Still, I did get five years of daily use from it (over 2000 pulls) and so I ordered a new one. This one was received factory packed incomplete and the casing was damaged (before leaving factory). It's a gamble. I will cannibalize my old one to make this one function."
3,I agree .....,It will do everything but some will also find it lacking in different ways. It is a messy little beast but at least it works which is more that I can say about my Briel 271....
1,Get the 2CD version,"It isn't just that three songs are deleted from the single cd version (as if that weren't bad enough), but virtually all of Anderson's banter is gone. As one who was there (three separate times), I can tell you that was an integral part of a Jethro Tull concert.The complete (2 cd) version gets 5 stars. Look for it in the import section of the better music stores. I just found a copy the other day - and bought it."
3,not the 2 cd set...,I tend to agree. With the remastering of the Jethro Tull catalogue underway it is hoped that Chrysalis will once again bring into print the full 2 cd version of this Tull live set.It is not worth buying otherwise.
4,Where is Painted Desert?,"In the last 20 years, I've worn out three copies of this recording - once on vinyl and twice on tape. Time to replace it with a CD, but I have one questions: WHERE IS PAINTED DESERT? That was one of the best cuts on the record!"
4,Great Album,"This album has some of Pat Benatar's best work on it but the real gem of the collection is ""Wuthering Heights"" which really captures the spirit of the story."
1,Obsessed with Edith,"I found the first few pages of this biography enjoyable and informative reading. Once TR's second wife enters the picture, however, the going gets heavy. Edith Carow Roosevelt steals the show as the wicked stepmother who cannot do anything right. Mr. Brough seems to forget his book is about Alice--every other sentence is about the coldness, unkindness, sternness and nervous hypochondria of the second Mrs. R. After a chapter or two of this, it ceases to be believable. It is hard to trust a biographer with such an obvious bias against an individual.Further, although Mr. Brough lists in the front acknowledgements books to which he is indebted (and also interviews with various individuals related to the story, including Alice herself) , he does not have a full proper bibliography or footnotes. Specific references for mentions of Mrs. E. Roosevelt's character would, at least, have been helpful."
5,Excellent book,This is book one of a three part series - all of them are excellent. Great suspense book.
4,This one has you guessing,"I liked the people in this book, so much so that it would be nice to have a sequel with the same characters."
4,mystery series,enjoyed this series. Easy to read even when tired. Great series to forget your problems and enjoy an easy read.
4,whirlpool,A cute series that is light but entertaining. A really good series to read when you want to relax and enjoy yourself
2,Didn't measure up to Ivy,Not nearly as good as the Ivy Malone series. I was very disappointed. I won't be buying the rest of the series.
3,Whirlpool,I enjoyed all the books (3). They kept you guessing and you really got to know the characters. I enjoyed the fact that the books were both christian and mystery.
3,A disappointment.,I really liked the Ivy Malone novels and so I decided to try the Julesburg series. I was very disappointed. The heroine in Julesburg is not anywhere near as engaging as Ivy Malone. She comes off as a bit whiny. And not too bright. The author has the heroine do things that are just plain stupid merely to advance the plot. I'll skip the rest of the books in this series.
2,Pass!,"Loved the Ivy Malone novel, it was great, so I thought I'd try this series. It is well written, but the story did not sit well with me at all. Stephanie came off as awfully gullible, niave, and dingy (lacking any common sense whatsoever) for someone her age with her responsibilities and background. It is amazing she trusted Damon over Ryan. Ugh. I almost didn't finish it.I think I'll give the rest of this series a skip."
2,"disappointing, ridiculous","After reading the Ivy Malone mysteries by this same author (and really enjoying them) I was looking forward to the Julesburg series. This first book in the series was a disappointment to me--I'm hoping the other two will be better. After a very ho-hum beginning the story line did pick up a little. The only redeeming quality was the awesome dog--otherwise I probably would not have finished the book. Most of the way through it I kept thinking to myself ""how ridiculous."""
2,Not as well-written as the Ivy Malone series,The heroine makes one foolish decision after another. I'm hoping that the second book in this series contains characters that are more level-headed. :)
5,Whirlpool,I loved this book!! It was a wonderful beginning to the series. I read them all three in three days. Although the book was used it was in excellent condition. I am very pleased with this purchase.
2,"A beatific brazen, yet playful and plashless 5th attempt.","A playful plashless recording. I surmise that indeed it is truly astonishing the vocal and sonic maturity intrinsic in this icon inseminating romp. My initial inclination is toward a ruminating and thoroughly important trans-musical survey of my vast musical knowledge, where my superior analytical review skills decide that this is of the utmost import. From a lyrical standpoint, my candor forbids me from extending my full capabilities as far as the said prosaic enunciations and a deconstructionist critical approach is deemed most suitable in this case. Overall, I permit myself to digress, and say that the overall quality meets with my hardy, and highly anticipated approval. And I look forward to hearing more from the young lads. Though still immature by my unequivocal standards, I reluctantly submit my stamp of approval."
5,"""Hey you! Come along for the ride...""","If John Lennon, Nick Lowe, Elliott Smith, and Keith Moon met along the space-time continuum and formed a Halifax-based pop-supergroup, it would sound an awful lot like Sloan. And this is the album they would record after a long night of listening to the MC5 and trading spoonerisms. If that doesn't sound like a flattering description, then maybe this is not for you. If you're into riff-driven, lyrically adventurous pop songs, then maybe it is.Previous Sloan albums have leaned towards pure pop song production. This has that too (see 'Keep on Thinking', and 'Chester the Molester' for good examples of this). But it also has really adventurous songwriting ('Sinking Ships') and riff-rock monsters laden with pop-tune harmonies and 'I Am The Walrus'- lyricism ('Money City Maniacs' and 'She Says What She Means').This album stayed in my CD player for months. It has that kind of staying power."
5,"The BEST cd of 98' poppy, FUN and easy to love GREAT!","Sloan is one of the best bands out right now! I've always liked them ,but NAVY BLUES put SLOAN over the top!! What else can be said but , this band has been overlooked by the US Alt. scene,(I don't get it) THE BAND ROCKS live and is highly under rated. It;s hard to read up on this band but all I have read , is GREAT!!!!! I don't have much else to say but this cd and this band are the BEST things out right now!!!"
4,Sloan rules,Great sloan cd. Some of my favorite Sloan tunes here.These guys are one of the best pop rock outfits out there -jp
4,judge them not for their greasy locks,"sure, their hair is greasy, but when it comes to the music, sloan keeps it tidy: the album is a veritable textbook of clever songs and arrangment tricks that other bands would do well to study and pilfer. The next album is purportedly straight up jungle, so savour their pop sound while ye may."
1,scrape therapy,"This DVD is in chinese, subtitles and audio. Since I don't KNOW the Chinese language, all I saw was the video portion. Had NO IDEA what they were saying. I would not recommend this video to anyone."
3,Crackling sound...,"Sound crackles when there's a lot of low bass-y earthquake tones or weather effects being played, which is pretty common in video games."
5,Worked exactly as described. Recieved relatively fast too!,"Did exactly as stated. Checked other people/companies that were selling the same thing and this one had the most positive reviews. I decided to go with this one and was pleasantly surprised. You never know what you will get, so i was happy with this. It connected the way it should to both the wii and the 55"" LG LCD television. Colors perfect, NO interference or lines through the picture. So for the very little money it cost it is no question it was a good deal. FYI, i used the change i throw in my car and dresser to get this. After every week i have roughly 20 dollars in change which I throw in coinstar and choose an amazon e-gift card with NO FEE! So it really feels like this was free, lol."
5,Works Great,"Not much to say about the product, it works like it is supposed to. Plugged in and works great. Worth the money when connecting to hdtv."
5,It works,"Ok, this product arrived a day before the expected time. That is one great thing. Another is that Skyward Sword works and looks a ton better on my HD TV than on my SD TV. There is nothing else to be said about this."
1,not compatible,dont waste your money on this i used it one time and it looks worse than the regular one is not compatible
4,Everything you need.,This product is everything you would need. The connectors do not fit that snug but they get the job done.
5,Good price and works great.,"This component cable for wii improves picture quality and contrast. But you have to make sure to plug it in correctly as there are two red connectors. White and red connectors wired beside one another are audio, the blue, green and red connectors are video. If you get weird picture or audio it may be that they are pluged in improperly. Mine helped picture and graphics look brighter and more defined. The wii is capable of 480p with this cable not 1080p so don't be dissapointed if it dosen't turn the wii into a ps3, it won't but it will help improve your gaming experience."
5,Works as it should,"Works perfectly. Easy install. These cables are exactly as advertised. They clear up the Wii image quite a bit on my HD tv, vs the av cables that came with the Wii. At such a managable price, theres no reason anyone with a Wii and an HD tv shouldnt buy one!"
4,Best upgrade value for Wii,"Switching to component cords for your Wii is the cheapest upgrade you can make if you have a HD TV. The Wii currently doesn't support HDMI, so component is the best you can get. This is an especially good upgrade if you watch movies or TV shows via Netflix on your Wii - the picture is noticeably crisper.Target and other stores sell these exact same cables for about 3x the cost ($30), but I can't imagine there is a good reason to get the ""official"" product over this generic one."
5,Component Cables for WII,"The cables work great! Was a little leary when the price of the cables were only $3 but thought I woud give them a try. Glad I did! I wasn't looking for any improved video or sound, just wanted to connect my WII up to the new TV. Product arrived at my house in 7 days just as promised; just a quick plug in and was up and running."
4,Good value for money,"Good product to buy to improve the picture quality over the AV cables. I noticed marked improvement in picture quality and sound. It is still 480p picture since Wii does not come with 1080p resolution so do not expect significant change. Overall a good value for money and it gives you the ability to get the best resolution possible, from Wii."
5,Good value,The cables had excellent build quility. I hooked them up to my Wii and Plasma TV. Don't forget to set the Wii preferences to 480 progressive. The picture is indeed better. Very good price on a quality product.
5,"Great Cable, Even Better Price","I decided on this cable after searching around for the best prices. I just bought an HDTV, and though the Wii isn't full HD I wanted to be sure I was getting the highest clarity possible. I was NOT disappointed! The cables arrived quickly and were factory sealed. They work great, transmitting crystal clear stereo sound and crisp 480p images (the Wii's highest definition). Now, if you want to use these cables its important to remember that you'll need a left/right (white/red) audio input on your television, since the component cables only transfer video. I have mine hooked up to an open A/V slot and they work fine, but your TV may be different, so be prepared. But, as long as you have the available spots, this is a fantastic buy! It's hard to believe, since the price is so much less than other component cables for the Wii, but these cables are great quality. If you want to get the most out of your Wii's graphics, I would highly recommend this product."
5,"For the price, AWESOME cables.","I noticed a slight improvement over the standard cable that came with the Wii. The Wii is not capable of real HD, so it won't turn your Wii into a PS3, but for the money it is worth it, just buy 'em."
5,Component AV Cable for Nintendo Wii to HDTV Great Deal!,"Very good product. Made the Wii look much better on the 60""! Wasn't sure if there was much hope for it!"
5,Great Book by a true lover of the game!,"This book has assisted me in every aspect of the game. Mr. Bartanus is a well versed instructor. I was lucky enough to meet Mr. Bartanus in person. I work at an ID Card office in Germany, and Mr. Bartanus was a customer of mine. He took the time to help me with my swing right in my office. He also came back a few days later to bring me an autographed copy of his book and a large sack of golf balls. I have a lot of respect for Mr. Bartanus, and for this wonderful golf instuction book he wrote."
4,Not a bad little game!,"Just played this on my Wii & I like it. I'm a little surprised an the use of original villians & not the stock characters, but not bad so far! P&B games are fun as well."
2,At least there back ... Too bad it's like this.,"One of the funniest cartoons of the early 90's. Way to go bringing back the characters to the kid friendly Gamecube. My five year olds thought this game was ""ok."" And that is pretty much the best review for the game coming form our home. This game was weak, weak, weak. You pretty much run around the levels, talk to a guy, kill the bad guys (after you get hit a couple of times, they spin around and hur themselves, and you bop them). Then move on to the next level. How this game was green lit for any reason other than the Animaniacs licesne, I'll never know. Thanks for bringing back the Animaniacs, please do not dishoner them netx time."
4,good starting point,"This was the first resource that I read in dealing with my post pardom depression. It was a good resource to help me tell exactly where I was on the scale of mid to severe depression. It is written in relativly simple termanology, and helped me realize I was not alone.It is a good resource. Money well spent."
4,Helpful tool for clinician and mom,"Beyond the Blues is an easy way to learn about the basic signs and symptoms of postpartum depression. It is a good introduction for new moms looking to identify if they are at risk for, or are currently struggling with PPD. I also recommend it for any clinician, nurse practitioner or health support person currently working with new moms. Preventing PPD is key and the upfront content of this book makes it one useful tool in doing so."
4,Excellent Resource,"This is an excellent resource for new mothers, their families and healthcare providers. It is user-friendly and provides reliable and helpful information. As a psychologist in private practice, I always recommend the book to the postpartum women and healthcare providers I work with."
5,"Sara Napa, CA saranapa@hotmail.com","I suffered, boy did I suffer, from PPD 4 months after my daughter was born. It was like running into a brick wall while running and looking the other way. This book could have possibly saved my life. I called Dr. Bennett herself and asked her to help me and my family. Since she lives around where I am she took me on as a patient, and helped me so much. I love her for it, and I loved this book even before I met her. If you are suffering from this terrible condition do not keep it to yourself...there is help you just have to keep telling people how bad you feel until someone listens. You are NOT ALONE!"
1,Not worth the money,"There is nothing in this ""book"" that you can't get online for free or in a 500-word magazine article. I was hoping for more in-depth discussion of treatment options and the underlying risk factors for PPD. This book offers nothing more than a cursory overview of the topic. Don't waste your money."
3,Oedipus review,"I thought this was a very tragic story about a man who was cursed from birth by the false gods that were made up by the Greeks. I enjoyed how the story described the scene. The descripted writing was vivid and painful. Even though I enjoyed that part of it, overall I didn't think it was very good because it lacked what something I like in plays and that was a big finish. It focused on the motif of sight through out the whole story which was good but I was dissatisfied with the ending being Oedipus raking his eyes out, I wanted something more, not quite sure what that is but I guess I'll never know."
3,hmmmmm......,"This book was alright. It is in between good and bad. It was a little sick and demented. I don't know what the author was thinking about when he put the incest in there. That is just sick even though the characters didn't know that is what they were doing. The book was good otherwise. It made you think, because you had to remember the characters didn't know what you knew until the very end. It was interesting, though, but not a book I would choose to read in my spare time. It was a good choice for school."
2,It was ok to read once.,"If I had to give the book thumbs up or thumbs down, it would be down. The book was flat and really never picked up. The book is full of irony, but lacks excitment. All though the book, it drags on. Some parts I really enjoyed, but there was very few. The book was ok to read once, but I would not read it again. If you get alot of time, it would be a decent book to read, but if your in a hurrty to read a book, dont waist your time.Over all, I really didnt care for the book. The writer did a fantastic job of writing it, but it lacked what I enjoy reading about."
5,Interesting Epic,This Epic was referred by my professor. Although some parts of the epic confused me I really enjoyed it. Very interesting.
4,oedipus is crazy,Oedipus is crazy because he racked his eyes out with the brooches. I thought that he was crazy by the way he bossed around everyone. Also i thought it was crazy how his wife was his mother and his kids was his sisters. Ths book was cazy from the get go. Personally I would recomend this book to everyone.Before we started reading this book I thought it was stupid.
3,Josh Steele's Oedipus Review,I thought the book Oedipus Rex was an alright book but not a great book. I would not reccomend this book to a friend. It is a very complicated book and there is a lot of things that are going on and if you miss or not understand one thing you will probably not understand the book. If your a reader that enjoys figureing things out this would proabably be the book for you. If your a cool person you should probably not read this book.
3,All One Big Family,"The play Oedipus used a lot of good examples of dramatic irony, which makes the play more interesting. Throughout the play, there was a lot of incest, but the characters did not find out until the end that they were all related. Oedipus killed his father, married his mother, and had children with her. Although there were a lot of interesting details, the play seemed to drag on. New forms of incest seemed to always be occuring. Oedipus was some-what ignorant because Teirisias gave him many clues on who Oedipus's true family was. I think this play is well-written play, but I wouldnt reccomend it to other readers outside of high school."
2,"""Oediupus"" falls short of higher expectations","Oedipus did not fill my expectations for what I was led to believe. Before reading the story I was excited to read about a young King's plight to uncovering a confusing secret. In the middle of the story I found my mind wondering because the story did not hold my attention. It was boring because it was not in modern language. In order to follow the story, I had to keep stopping myself and take time out to understand the ""code"" of words. While I was taking time to understand I had already forgot what I was reading in the first place."
2,A boring read,"This book tells the story of a man who unknowingly kills his father and marries his mother. That would be an interesting story if it was written differently. The language used in this book is hundreds of years old and is not relevant to how speak today. The way this story is told makes it unbearable to get through and hard to understand. I'm not saying its that bad of a story, but there is no reason to read a book the way it was written in ancient Greece. It might actually be fun to read if someone were to give it a makeover and set in current times, but its not so don't waste your time with it."
3,Oedipus the Story of Inbreeds,"The story of Oedipus is not a bad story. It can become a little bit confusing for some. There are to many relationships to follow. You have to know all the relationshiops or it will be hard to follow. For example everyone knows what happens in the story. It just seems that in the story Oedipus may be able to realize that he is related to his mother. I don't think it should take him near has long has it did. Oedipus should look something like her. The play has some parts that can be disturbing, for example, picturing him having kids with is mother, raking his eyes out. I don't think very many people could do that to themselves. I think while he was doing that he would pass out from pain. But, hey it is just a story. Has I said earlier it is not a bad story. It is one that everyone needs to read because it is a classic. Don't go into this story with high hopes."
2,Oedipus Review,I really did not enjoy this book for that i could not get into. The whole family marrying and having relations without knowing factor was very sick to me. I do not understand how the mother and father could have left a baby to die and then she never realizes that it could even be her child.We know as the reader so much more then what the actors knew that it is hard to go and relate you just keep asking yourself why? The motif for this book helps you stay with the book to a degree because you try to figure out something more from it. I hope if you read it that you would enjoy and understand it more then me.
2,oedipus rex,"This wasn't really my kinda of story. It was very slow from the start and didnt really interest me untill the end of the plot.The whole inbred thing wasnt really my type of information,however the outcome of him raking his eyes out was pretty cool. Overall i didnt really enjoy the book,but the ending made up for some of the slow start. I would have to give this book 2stars out of 5 because i have read better storys throughout my life."
2,poopy,"I thought this story was kind of weird but at the same time the plot was good. Even though Oedipus ""rakes"" his eyes out it is cool for that reason. I would never read this book unless i had to again. Just for the fact that I hate to read."
3,...,"I thought the story was rather weird but a little entertaining, it was a little sick and twisted, but mabye that was how they did it back then. At first it was kind of boreing until it got into the weird stuff."
3,The book was amazing compared to the movie,"I thought this book was good but not really good. I'm glad I read it but I wouldn't want to read it again. It was interesting and it made me want to keep reading it, but some things about the book I didn't agree with because they were just too drawn out and it made things hard to understand. It got confusing. To me the incest was the main thing that was confusing. If not the only thing. But once I kept talking it over I understood and figured it out. I did like the suspense in the book concerning Oedipus and him knowing the truth about things. And the irony of the book was great because i liked knowing things without the characters knowing them as well. It was good choice to read in senior english. Although, I have to say the movie was HORRIBLE!"
5,Greek Tragedy,"I remember my humanities class well enough; I can say that Greek tragedies are what operas intended to give a picture of. This is of course the world famous play that we in the semi-aficionados regard as: ""The play that inspired Sigmund Freud to document a complex."" (How rogue of me.)Oedipus Rex illustrates a western European pagan world. Mystical with its oracles and soothsayers as Merlin from King Arthur's Court. Feverishly Bloody as Shakespeare's Othello. Incest, irony and revenge like, but more graphic and less poetics than Hamlet. On the other hand, I do remember rhyming words. But, this is a slim book with strong words. I give it 5 stars because has influenced many generations and messages of the human condition do come across clear as a bell. Too spiritually mundane for my tastes, though."
3,"We all have bad days, but...","When speaking of the worst day of our lives, most of us would like to say that we have hit rock bottom and lived to tell about it... ever slept with your mom, killed your dad, and fathered your sisters, all without knowing it? Didn't think so. Oedipus has alot of ""well that's nasty"" moments, aimed at getting the attention of those who love a complex but not very thought-provoking story line. Oedipus literally has it all, murder, revenge, sex (if you can call it that), plague, monarchy, suicide... fun, eh? Sophocles was one sick puppy. A must-read for all at some point, every library has a copy of Oedipus, so save your money."
3,Oedipus,"Oedipus Rex is read in many high schools all over the United States. It is a fairly interesting story compared to other books that are commonly read while attending high school. The story deals with fate and the belief of predestination. However, the story is fairly predictable. The reader knows almost everything that is going to happen throughout the story. This could make the story seem boring to some people, however other people do not mind it."
2,Incest Incest Incest,"Incest. Incest. Incest. This book is filled with incest. Everybody in this book is related in some way. This book was extremely far fetched. It is way out there. It was a little much for me. What a tragic life he lead. Personally, I felt sorry for Oedipus. Can that much horrifying stuff happen to one man? I sure hope not. I would not wish that upon anyone. Do not get me wrong, this book was interesting, but there is a point when enough is enough. I was just grossed out by the end of the book."
3,My Oedipus Opinion,"After reading this book it probably would be considered a really good book to some, but when i think about it is was just ok to me. I have never been into the worse that this book involves. I only could focus on it for a limited time. This is not a book that i could ever recommend to a child or a young teen that is not willing to hear and see the most horrible things possible. I think this is a book that is for college typed students and also adults."
1,My opinion on Oedipus,"I really didn't like this book because, they were always beating around the bush and they never just came out and said what they were trying to say.Who would marry someone old enough to be his mother? Who would kill their baby? Just because someone said that he was going to kill him. The book was so fake especially, the raking of his eyes. Who would kill theirself just because they made a mistake. On the whole, it was just a terrible book and never made any since. It was very boring and would not ever recommend it to anyone."
2,Oedipus,We have read this book in one of my classes. I didnt like this book on bit.It was like writing in the old style.The book was nasty oedipus married his mother and had two kids with her.I realy dont like reading about that kind of stuff.I think this book was boaring i didnt like the plot.They just came out with stuff out of no where.Like when they would have to get rid of the person who had killed king laius to get rid of the plague.Over all I think this book was a realy bad book.
2,A Family Affair,"This whole book was about incest! There was almost nothng else in the book. Everyone is related to everbody else in some way. Im not in to all that stuff. I think Sophocles went a little too far. I understand that incest went on back then but give me a break! The story was a litte too far out there.Too many bad things occurred. I think nothing good happened to anyone in the play. At the end all the people got hurt in some way. Also, how could anybody do what Oedipus did at the end?? It was horrible. However, the play was interesting enough for me to finish it."
1,Why Oedipus?,"This book was very boring to me. It was kind of hard to understand.... The part when they where having sex with their family was very nasty. I hope that i would not have to ever read anything else about this book. Because it was not interesting at all. It did not get any of my attention. The book of Oedipus, which I did not like at all. ..."
3,oedipus rex,"In english class we are reading the story ""Oedipus Rex."" I think that the story is ok. I think that it is very interesting. Although some of the story may be hard to understand at times,once you go over what each paragrah means it makes more sence. I would recommend this book for other ninth graders to read. I think you will enjoy this. Especially if you like Greek Mythology. Therefore my overall review is good. :"
3,"Michael Robinson,s opinion on Oedipus Rex","Oedipus rex is a great book if you are into the ancient Greek Arts. I thought the book was hard to read, because of the old greek grammer. If you think this kind of writing is like poetry or music to your ears, then you will like this book.I think that this book has some pretty twisted characters. Oedipus, the king of thieves, is married to his mother. Creon, his brother-in-law/uncle treats Oedipus well even though Oedipus treats him like dirt. Jocasta, Oedipus' mother, is clueless that she married her son until the end of the book.This books plot was O.K. you never knew what strange thing was going to happen next."
3,The truth shall set you free?,"Oedipus was a good novel. Even though I did enjoy reading it I only gave it three stars. My reason for this is that it is definatley not a, on the edge of your seat thriller. Oedipus does however, have many themes and one important motif,the motif being sight. This however is not the part that intrigued me the most though. There is a very old biblical saying, indicated in the title, that is totally made into a falsehood in this novel. In most cases the truth is what sets us free and keeps burdens off of our shoulders. In Oedipus, however, the truth does nothing but destroy the lives of not only Oedipus, but his whole, disfunctional family. Like I said earlier, Oedipus is definately not a novel to be categorized as dramatic, but it does do a good job of keeping you intrigued. I would definately promote this novel to be added to anyone's personnal reading collection."
3,The tale of a very close family secret,"The book Oedipus Rex is very well written. The story is based on times before ours so it is very interesting to learn about how they lived back then, compared to how we live now. The book deals with a lot of issues that are not often thought of by us; incest is one example of that. I enjoyed this book because it made me think about things that I usually don't think about, and it made me look at things in a different way. The story was very unique, and I thought it was a great book."
5,A must have!,The most detailed and helpful book I've ever picked up when it comes to gen IV & V big blocks!
1,Terrible product,I normally only write reviews when I get a truly bad product. This is one of those reviews. This product is very confusing to assemble. The hanger itself is made of aluminum and bends easily. The screws got stripped and I had to use some gripping tools to get them out. The aluminum bent and I had to pound it back into shape with a hammer. All around crappy product. I would have been better off with a piece of wire coat hanger.
1,Poor design - not what advertised,"These ""brackets"" were made of very inexpensive aluminum which would not fit over the cap on my 3"" cubicle wall. When they were placed over the wall they bent so badly they were not only unusable but unreturnable - $15 for brackets was already over my price range - now I'm out the money and ended up using a homemade bracket for $5 from the hardware store."
2,quartet cubicle hooks,"Very weak - doesn't hold to the top of the panel well. You could hang only something very lightweight, and even then it might slip. Just not designed well."
3,Quartet Adjustable Cubicle Hangers,"They get the job done, but I had to add Velcro to better secure the lower part of the whiteboard against the cube walls in order to prevent the board from shifting when using the eraser. For the price, I think this is not sturdy enough. The pros, this is generic enough to fit any whiteboard or keyhole item.I suggest a trip to Lowes before buying."
4,Great Product,Product was exactly what was described and works as intended. The metal piece is a little too flexible so just bend it backwards to start.
1,A real disappointment !,"In short, the author went to a few bike meets, took some photos and probably put the book together in an afternoon.If you are interested in the technical aspect of the bike and its hardware, you can get more technical info from Honda's sale brochure.The photographs are colorful, in focus and correctly exposed and that is about it. Any competent person with an auto everything SLR can probably do the same.But if you are looking for ideas to accessorize your wing, this may be a good starting guide."
3,review of book,"The book looked fine when it finally arrived. The packaging was poorly done. As a result, the package was ripped and the book could have easily been removed. Book was undamaged. Book was not placed correctly in the padded envelope. It also took weeks for it to arrive.Holly Haggerty"
5,"I have ""The 20th Century: A Moving Virtual History"" Box set","I Have that ""The 20th Century: A Moving Virtual History"" Box Set on VHS."
1,Holster for Samsung i500,If you use the standard battery or the extended battery the phone will not fit into the holster. Only the slim battery fits into the holster. It's advertised that the holster works with any battery. Well that's simply not the case. I am very dissapointed.
4,Better than the 1st season!,"Definitely better than the first season. It has more episodes following the main plot and also some secrets are revealed. Comparing with the first season, this one has a defined main story... focusing on Olivia and more on Walter Bishop character."
5,Great show.,"I love this series, it is unique and different from others and doesn't insult your intelligence. Great actors, new and old. Can't go wrong. Great price, as well."
5,Fringe rocks,"I love this series, I have watched all 4 of the seasons that you have on Amazon Prime and can't wait for the final season to be shown on Amazon Prime."
5,love this show,Me and my wife love this show!! It is interesting and funny! We will watch all the seasons! It is a great show!
4,Much better paced,"Compared to the first season, which really only became interesting in the last handful of episodes, season two is a definite improvement. Most of the time, the episodes still follow the ""monster-of-the-week"" format, but there a few less of these this time around. When FRINGE actually has a few episodes that pertain to the main story arc, it approaches LOST in how engaging it is.Best episodes of the season are August, Peter, Jacksonville, White Tulip, and the two part finale.To viewers of the first season who felt unimpressed: WATCH SEASON TWO. It is much better than season one in almost every way. And slowly becomes better and better."
5,Enjoy the series,I enjoy the Fringe stories and story lines. I would imagine its tough doing sci-fi but these actors do a great job.
3,show excellent,The show is excellent so why 3 stars? Disc 3 arrived damaged and I missed the return window because I just started watching the discs. Anyone know how I can get a replacement disc without having to buy the entire season again?
4,Wife loves the show,"What can i say , my wife likes the show and irate commercials!Pretty inventive show overall, but don't miss too many episodes you will be lost"
5,Season 2 is Even Better,Every season of Fringe is a 5 star. Gripping. Compelling. Nail-biting. I described season 1 as Bones x X-Files but Better and it still holds true. Awesome.
5,Haven't finished yet but .....,"I love it so far! I just hope that one very confusing issue is explained.....Agent Charles Francis, dead or alive? How strange."
4,Excellent waiting for more-without the comic strip-,Yes I like all 4 -1 through 4--excellent i love anna Torv and Dr bishop also his son good acting and Jesika--they all wonderful-i dont like the chief of the FBI that much--i cant wait for the other 5-6 and even 7-i already watched from 1 to 4- 3 times already-
5,Best episode so far.,I really enjoyed this episode. My favorite of the series so far. Peter Weller guest stars and has a memorable encounter with John Noble. The acting and drama is superb. Their encounter before the finale is filled with all sorts of awesome.
4,Fringe: season two,How can you go wrong with Blu-ray. The cost was perfect($25). I haven't watched all the extras yet but I'm excited about what this set offers.
5,Excellent,This is a great series. The only problem I have is that you really have to think about what's going on. It changes back and forth between universe's. The writers are genius and the cast of characters our outstanding. I haven't finished the 5th series yet but I am sure I won't be disappointed.
3,eh,"was expecting better ,kind of off the wall , acting is o.k. the story line is really getting out there."
5,Great Series,I love this series.I love Fringe because it is SCI-Fi with a twist. It has good characters and story lines.
4,Pretty good for the price,"The sleeve that all the discs are in isn't exactly like the one if you bought this in a store for 50$. The paper part under the plastic cover is just a bit wrinkley/wavey. Really doesn't make much of a difference, though. All the discs worked great on my DVD player. For some reason the first and last disc didn't work all the time on my laptop. My laptop is new, so I'm not sure where the problem was there. I think my laptop just didn't like those discs because they worked on other playback devices. Other than that, can't beat the price!"
1,No bueno.,"I have no idea how this show lasted more then one season when better shows like Day Break, FashForward, and Jericho only lasted one. I'm watching Fringe since it was recommended from a friend. Season 1 was absolutely awful. Season 2 is just as bad except for the last two episodes. Hopefully seasons 3-5 redeem the show."
2,"The Blatant ""Filler"" Episode","Well sometimes writers run out of ideas, and in a series like Fringe which is Chock-full of new interesting ideas they were bound to run dry once or twice. Honestly if you just watch the first 2 minutes (to see Walter hitting the bong) and the last 3 minutes you will not miss ANYTHING AT ALL. Synopsis: Walter smokes weed and then tells a fictional story (set in the 50s for some reason) the whole episode while Ella interjects. Oh and there's a very under-produced musical number randomly in there....I was going to give it a 3/5...but I couldn't forgive the musical part.Only for the hardcore Fringe completionist that thinks they have to see every single episode. To all others i recommend taking my advice, save some time, and use that time to watch the next episode. Now if you'll excuse me I'm going to travel back in time 40 minutes to tell myself this *POOF*"
5,More & More Comes Unveiled,"The action continues to step up with a crisis point occurring between Walter Bishop and Peter. These two have done an excellent job of pushing their way to the forefront of this show. I'm not sure who was intended to be the star of this show but at this point it is Walter and then Peter. Everyone else is quite distant from them as far as carrying this show. There is a great special effects scene where Peter sees a man from the other side on the same bridge as himself appear. An FBI agent near Peter blows up from the other world materializing with them on the bridge. Great episode, great season. This is one of the few newer shows which has become a solid hit. If you are not yet a viewer, you should be."
4,I like the subject matter,"The acting is good, the plots are interesting I like that they have returning actors and continuing plots.That is all"
4,Very good!,I really like this series and watching the 3rd season now. Me and my wife really enjoy an episode after dinner!
4,LovedIt,"If you like attention grabbing weird, this is the show for you. It captured my attention at the first episode."
4,Great show,I have always enjoyed this show and it is nice to see it for free with amazon prime. Nice bonus
5,nice,I haven't seen a science related scifi series in a long time. This series is a breath of fresh air.
5,Can't get more convenient and valuable via Prime Account!!!,"I have just started using Amazon regularly over the past 2 months, and I am more than thrilled with their selections and service.....delivery service has to be second to none!!!!Mike"
5,The Ultimate Thrill Ride,Fringe is the ULTIMATE...I can't say enough about the cast! Fantastic all the around and from episode 1 they were together like they had been together forever. Fantastic chemistry! This show is beyond compare...I never miss an episode and look forward to watching Season Two on Blu-Ray...over and over! A real treat!
4,Fringe second season,Item arrived on time. Was like new. Son was very excited to receive as a gift. Great service. Would use again.
3,Confused,A good episode like all the others but what is Charlie (Olivia's FBI partner) doing here? I thought he got killed off in Season 1?
4,A good series,"this series was cut way too short. It should have been on for at least 3-5 more seasons. It was very original, well scripted, and even had a decent cast. But still, it should have been given a few more seasons."
5,awesome,"Waited to the last season to start watching,glad I did the cliffhangers in-between seasons or even for a week would of drove me crazy....this show is awesome"
5,"Sci Fi second only to Firefly,","it's the best sci fi since Firefly, only the story continues. As with most of my favorites, I didn't get in on the first broadcast, but am catching up thanks to Prime Streaming."
4,Critical episode,This one is a must see. Doctor Bishop's big secret is finally discovered by the other characters and the following episodes should address the kidnapping.
5,Better than the X-Files,"I have not seen a series this good since the X-Files. This one is better, I think, because it tells you about the quantum physics matters."
5,great show,Very intersting tv series. Has a lot of crazy twists and takes a much different approach than other csi style shows
2,poor connection with Prime Instant viewing,The show is great. I am thinking of cancelling my Prime if the ability to view does not become more reliable.
5,"Amazing on Blu-ray. Spend the extra few $, you won't regret it.","This series has always been incredible aesthetics-wise, not to mention the content is also jaw-dropping. I just got a 32', 1080p Sony Bravia and this series looks AMAZING on it. I'm new to the whole Blu-ray thing, but this is a perfect series to showcase it. My DVD of Season 1 doesn't even compare. Keep in mind you'll only be able to tell the difference if you own a high-end TV.As for the series, it's flawless as far as I'm concerned. I've been a fan ever since the pilot aired. There's nothing else like it on television, that's for sure."
4,Good show; exellent streaming quality,Overall I find the show engaging and the story interesting. How nice is it have this available without commercials?!
5,Fringe,"This is a great show for sci-fi fans. We have purchased every season, just sad to see it come to an end."
3,Losing Puff,"A pursuit for demons is continuing to secure a world while a script of second season shifted from extremes of real natural physics occurrences into Touchwould et al area of superficial with some religious attachments.If not knowing of existence of further two seasons to date, illogical actions could dramatise even more substantially."
1,"Turn up the sound, please!","After viewing the first season of Fringe I cannot say how delighted I have been with the series. One of the great things about the production is that characters have not been speaking in hushed, conspiratorial tones. Everything was clear and I could enjoy the actors, acting, and screenplay This was not the case with other thrillers, detective, and scifi series I have watched. Try to decipher the plot when actors speak with backs to the camera, making even lip reading impossible. However, this opening episode for Season 2 requires subtitles if I am to follow it. I think the most disappointing aspect of the instant streaming has been the video quality. It can range from excellent to poor. Hoping that the next episode will be audible."
1,major disappointment,"The first season was pretty mediocre, sort of a X-file wannabee for teanagers. Each episode follows the same recipe: a gross prologue, followed by pseudo-scientific gibberish, then an ending which does not even make any sense (can't big studios pay someone to check plots for inconsistencies?).However a couple of episodes near the end of the first season led us to believe that there was a ""Great Plot"" coming up, that's why we bought the second season.At the beg. of the second season, we got a couple of episodes that explored the ""Great Plot"", and then after nothing: we are back to more and more stupid x-file-like fillers and the characters act as if there were no Great Plot. We just gave up."
1,Dont do it!!!!,"Poor streaming, also dont buy into this America. Live your life the show needs you not the other way around. Lets not get suckered into this."
3,Not what was represented to us,"We were told when we ordered it that it would work on our pc that is not a Mac. When we got it, we found that it would not, in fact, work on our non-Mac pc. I was not in the position at the time to be able to send it back and when I was, I assumed it was too late. That is on me. However, what disturbs me most about this purchase was that we were completely misled about the product and my son was very disappointed and heart-broken. We bought two beloved games we thought we would be able to use on our computer and were not. If I had not failed to get up with Cyberfix, I would have given them a 2-star instead of a 3-star rating."
5,Best sports medicine book for the layman,"I have purchased 3 copies of this book over the years as I routinely loan them to friends. The book is an easy read, but remarkably comprehensive for a book designed for the lay public. Garrick, unlike many orthopedic surgeons, prefers to take a conservative approach to joint problems with surgery as the last option. He covers rehabilitation for the major joints, advice that has proved invaluable for me for both tennis elbow and a torn ACL. Tennis elbow cleared up following strengthening exercises he recommeded. Strengthening did not resolve the ACL tear in my knee and I did have an ACL repair done. Take his advice, keep your vastus medialis strong and you won't have any knee problems. He offers good advice on self treatment for simple sprains, but clearly points out conditions that need to be seen by a specialist ASAP. I highly recommend this book."
4,No Problems,I have used the Viking 512mb card in my Nikon D1X for over 6 months with no problems whatsoever! Good card for the price!
5,Perfect complement to a Canon G2,"Add this to a 4 mega-pixel camera such as the Canon G2 and you've got the capacity to shoot 500 pictures (at regular compression), that's either a very full weekend or a whole week of normal shooting. When traveling, we edit our pictures in the evening in the hotel - throwing out the duds to keep even more space available for the next day of shooting."
3,Beware rebate,"Getting them to honor the rebate was a battle.After 8 weeks, they informed me by e-mail that it was rejected.It took a phone call to the CEO's office (no kidding) and another 8 weeks to get the rebate check.Otherwise, the card has worked ok, but is probably on the slow side."
1,Defect CF card I purchased. How can I get replacement?,"I have had a Canon G2 since 2002. I used to use Viking 128 MB CF cards and had no problem. In October 2004, I bought one Viking CF512M 512MB CF card from Amazon. I did not use it until this summer. After I had taken 20 more photos and reviewed, I immediately found a few images corrupted. No matter how I tried, e.g. format the CF before use, there were alway corrupted images.I wonder if I can return the defect CF card and get a replacement from Amazon or from manufacturer?SherwoodL.A. county"
2,Compare Quality as well as Price,"I purchased a 512MB card in June. It has worked well so far, but recently I have been getting a number of ""corrupted data"" errors. The problem appears to be getting worse, at about 1 corrupted picture per 75-100. I haven't tried for a warranty replacement, but I intend to, and hopefully the replacement memory card will be better quality. If the quality is not improved, I will be looking for another vendor, even at a higher price."
2,Amazon rebate problems,"Yesterday I was going to order this card but there was a wait list. Today, now that the rebate has expired, the card ships within 24 hours. The same thing happened with the Viking 128MB SmartMedia card. Something very wrong at Amazon. Contacted customer service who were entirely not helpful, as they just espoused the company policy of offering something that they will not ultimately honor. Shame on you Amazon."
2,Bad with Canon G3,"I tried several CF cards and this is the only one having writing errors. So far it has lost about 1% of the images, don't buy it if you cannot afford missing a shot."
1,Card Error,"After serveral months of use, ""Card Error"" was shown on my Canon Digital Rebel for my 512MB Viking card, which was half full with pictures. Fortunately, I just lost a few of pictures. I tried to format the file; ""Card Error"" kept occuring on my Rebel. This 512MB Viking card is now used for my data files.Probably, 512MB Viking cards are not designed for high Mega Pixel camera and taking many shots in a short period of time (i.e. 3 shots/sec.). My Canon A40 has no problems when used with the 512MB Viking card so far. Probably, I am going to buy a 512MB card from Sandisk or Simple Tech."
4,"Very good product, never had problems.","I have a Canon S30 and an EOS Rebel, I have a Viking 128, 256 and a 512. In my Rebel the 128 is equal to the more expensive 12X cards of other manufacturers. Depending on the price, I have always searched for Viking first, then Lexar. I have had the best of luck with these two manufacturers. Also I never had a problem with receiving my rebates, usually they come very fast as I live in Southern Cal. I keep buying them!"
1,Not For Use in a Garmin GPS,"I put this card in my Garmin 2610 GPS and it worked for a couple days and now the GPS can't find any information on the card. It works in my camera and my reader can read it, but the GPS can't. It'll read my old 256 MB card, but not this one. I don't know if it's a compatability issue or what, but they don't seem to want to connect."
4,This card works for me in my Sony PDA,Viking CF512M 512 MB CompactFlash Card works in my pda flawlessly. I have stored around 60 mp3 songs and they sound really good to me.I also bought an USB compact flash readerwhich helps me to move around my data in the same Compact flashcard.Sandisk 512 MB flash memory costs $119 which does the same thing but doesnt fit in my PDA.In general I am happy with the card.
1,Disapointed!!!,"I purchased the 512 MB Viking flash card...and 3 months later the card is no longer functional, I am in the process of getting it replaced, but there is no reason why the card should have malfunctioned so quickly. I have used it over 100 times. I had the impression Flash cards lasted a long time. I also own four 256MB flash cards from Viking and those have never given me a problem. I also like to add the 512 MB is a very slow card, much slower than the 256 MB Viking card. I recommend the 256MB compact flash card, but stay away from the 512MB. There must be a reason why Viking cards are so [inexpensive] and Lexar cards so expensive. My next purchase will be a Lexar card and I hope I wont be dissapointed again."
5,AMAZON HAS A GREAT PRICE - Works like the rest of them,"This card at the time was an excellent value - works just like the rest of the brands - shop price & capacity & forget everything else - card speed is irrelevent in the consumer/prosumer market - IE the camera electronics are slower than the card - look for the mostest memory for the leastest price - HOWEVER, Do BUY A REPUTABLE BRAND"
1,Two Defefective Viking Cards....so far,"Buyer beware!I purchased a Viking 512 CF card and it lasted about a month before ceasing to function. The replacement card lasted about two months and then crashed. Interestingly, I discovered that my ""replacement"" card had already been returned once before by somebody else - I had NEVER been informed that I might receive a refurbished card.Viking refused to refund my money and is in the process of sending me another replacement. I wonder how long this one will last."
2,Failed after a few uses.,"I'm very disappointed at its quality. I give it 2 stars because I think if it doesn't fail, it's the cheapest one on the market.I used it in my Canon G2 digital camera. I only have the chance to fill it up about 5 times. Yesterday, when I was in a garden to shoot pictures, it started to have CF error on the screen. And it consistantly failed at the location of 128M of 487M even I formatted it. With this experience, I don't have confidence to bring it with me on the trips. I'm buying other brand's cards even they're more expensive."
1,Devastating Loss,Went corrupt and I lost very important pictures. Don't take the chance with Viking CompactFlash Cards
4,Excellent Card Value,This is an excellent buy and is a quality item. The service was fast and the card works as expected.
1,"DON""T BUY NO CUSTOMER SERVICE",There are better cards and the customer service sucks with viking. So get something anything else!!!!
1,Mine didn't work,"I just got mine a few days ago, and then I put it into my S400. After taking 5 pix, then it died. Good thing my camera was not damaged. I am going to return it to Amazon.com. I hope the returning process is smooth.I didn't believe those nagative comments when I ordered. It's my first time using Viking products, and I can tell you I am another unfortunate customer. My lucky part is that it died so fast that I am able to refund this to Amazon.com"
5,Great card at a great price,I bought the Viking CF512M 512 MB Compact Flash Card to go with my Fuji S2 Pro. The card worked right out of the box with no problems. This is a great price for this size card and right now (september 2002) there is a ... rebate from Viking. I think I may buy another one.
2,"Olympus C-5050 Viking ""CARD ERROR""","I bought the Viking 512MB at a fair price (with manufac. rebate), but received ""CARD ERROR"" message on first use with my Olympus C-5050. This occured in 3 or 150 images taken at SHQ resolution (2.5 to 3.0 megabyte files). I like price, but now I am afraid to take this card on vacation for fear of corrupt images.I am planning to contact the manufacturer for a replacement."
2,Not what you think,"Be Sure you measure your guitar before you place your order. If you do not have an Amigo guitar it will not fit in this case and the company will not pay the shipping on the return. Not worth the money. I was under the impression that a full size case is just that, full size. This one is not."
2,Chipboard Case Full Size Guitar,"It was in Good New Purchase, but it wasn't able to be my fit for a Full size Acoustic Guitar. The Case wasn't high enough.I was able to take it to Radio Shack and work out something with them. It was new so I was able to switch another case there."
2,No document CD for this CLI only dsl router,"This seems to be working dsl router with lots of features.This verion of 3347 has no web interface, cli command only.It shipped with an empty document CD which leaves the end user no where to get this litte device going. I have struggle to bring up the DSL link, but what about the rest LAN or vlan settings ?/!End up with return."
1,Don't bother...,Bought two sets of these and didn't get five decent pages printed. Ended up back at Staples paying big bucks. You get want you pay for.
2,Color is not true,"I thought I would try these since I go through a lot of cartridges. They set up fine but the color is flat and not true. The yellow lookes like a dirty yellow with no gloss to it at all. I don't think I will buy again. I had a better color with the ones I did myself. I'm giving it a two because they worked when I installed them, with no errors."
2,Color cartridge is defective,"I have ordered this twice. The first time, the color cartridge lasted only a couple of days. I thought that was strange, but I also knew I had used a lot of ink trying to clean the printer, so I just ordered more.There is NO YELLOW in this cartridge! It will only print shades of pink and lavender.I don't really need to print in color, but the printer only works if both cartridges are in it. My printer is functioning, and I have not had any problems with the black cartridge, but if you actually want to print in color, I would definitely not recommend this product."
2,About what you'd expect for the price,"The color ink cartridge printed light blue as light green on the very first printing. Very good price, but quality is poor. The black cartridge was fine, though. The seller very kindly replaced the color cartridge, but the quality of the replacement was just as poor. The test page my HP printer first prints when a cartridge is inserted showed spotty blue, spotty red and muddy, spotty yellow on the very first printing. The quality of the replacement cartridge was slightly better than the original, though, so it could be a roll of the dice."
2,I suppose I got what I paid for.,"I ordered remanufactured ink cartridges and they are performing like remanufactured ink cartridges. The black ink is working fine, but the color ink is low on red, so the color images and such are looking spotty. I guess I will just have to pay the couple of extra dollars next time and get them refilled at Cartridge World.HP 45 Black & HP 78 Tri-Color Remanufactured Ink Cartridges"
3,Compatible HP 45 & 78 Ink Cartridges Combo 2-Pak: 1 Black / 1 Color,"Print quality was OK, but faded out noticeably quicker than the original HP cartridge. On my next re-order, I passed up the up-front savings and went back to original HP product..."
1,Remanufactured HP 45 & 78 Ink Cartridge Combo pack from TonerPals,"AMAZON would like me to contact the supplier before putting this negative comment up. That is a waste of time and effort. I just ordered; and received; and installed; and used flawlessly; HP original equipment replacement cartridges. The remanufactured ones from TonerPals gave poor printing results and I have disposed of them appropriately. 'nuf said about that! I, like others here, should have known better. I am now being pressured by TonerPals to change the review of their company because they sent it in the time limit set on ordering. In my opinion you rate the company by the products they sell. 'nuf said about that too!!"
1,Boo for customer service.,I sent emails to seller in an attempt to cancel or change order before the product was shipped. My printer died and I purchased a new one. The seller ingnored emails and shipped anyway with the only contact made about shipping. Judging from the other reveiws of this product I should have known better. I will not purchase from them again.
1,"Had high hopes, not any more",I have a HP6127 that has served me for years. It is lightly used. I purchased a color/bw combo and after two weeks (maybe 5 printed sheets total) the red stopped working. Oh well. You get what you pay for.
5,Helpful,I originally ordered the incorrect color cartridge but Abacus did a great job of helping me return the wrong item and sending me the correct one.
3,For banjo history buffs...,"Raymon Fairchild belongs to an exclusive group of super pickers that Bela Fleck has credited with providing inspiration for his own work. Fairchild's picking is raw and fast, and his sound is straight from the mountains. Listening to Fairchild and his unique 3-fingered style is a little like watching a Ken Burns documentary- like finding a missing piece of a puzzle- you'll begin to see the whole picture in the history of the 5 string banjo.These recordings vary in quality from poor to fair, but each seems faithful to the original."
5,The Coaching Philosophies of Louis van Gaal and the Ajax Coaches,"Football is a team sports and this book explain everything. From the head coach all the way down to the last man,every coaches contribute in their own philosophies in coaching football. Louis van Gaal's beliefs and trust in his coaches is also one of the many reasons why AJAX is successful with their brand of football in the early 90s. I'll recommend this book to any coaches who has interests in coaching or building a football team. The authors also make the book very enjoyable. Not too much of dry tactics and stats,but lots of ideas and thinkings of the beautiful game."
1,Huge mistake to order it.,"Amazon's description of this product is very misleading. I thought I was ordering a collection of coming of age stories for boys. Not so! I found it to be deeply disturbing myself, never mind my 13 yr. old son. This might be of interest to a college-level student studying myths and folklore. Even so, you'll have to put up with a nauseatingly self-righteous voice in a very annoying tone."
3,frothing is tricky,"The design of this machine is somewhat cumbersome. The cup that holds the coffee in place is hard to attach, and the frothing attachment could be the most frustrating thing I have ever tried to work with. With the dial on the left side of the machine, it is hard to turn (if you are right handed) and you must stand by at the ready w/your pitcher of milk. It isn't clear what way is ""on"" (although you learn that after a couple of times) and I yet to succeed on making a good pitcher of froth. It is quite annoying. Nonetheless, for the money it does it's job...don't buy unless you have lots of patience!!!!"
3,good enough,"These are pretty cheaply made, but they served their purpose to finish off my costume. Would not reccomend if you need to wear them more than a few times"
4,Not sure yet!,"I caught this pan on for $$$ down from $$$ so I figured what the heck. It is Calphalon non-stick quality all the way. We are still exploring uses for it. One good thing about it is it will fit on a burner with another pan on an ajacent burner and still give a good deal of cooking area. When you get right down to it all this thing is is a funny-looking skillet that works real good!! I can see its use for a side of salmon or other large fish fillet or a pork or beef loin or tenderloin without wasted space. No matter,couldn't turn down the price. Sorry it isn't available any more. I gave it 4 stars because it is Calphalon Non-stick quality. I didn't give it 5 because I am not qiute sure how much we will use it."
2,Expensive for what you get.,"I had a set of steak knives that didn't cut very well. I was so sick of them I decided to spend what I thought was a considerable sum to get ""good"" knives. Unfortunately, I did not see the editor's comments on this site before buying--they do tear meat, rather than cut it. Frankly, they are only marginally better than those they replaced. [The block is also fairly useless. Who wants their steak knives sitting on the counter top all by themselves? I have my kitchen knives in a block and do not need or want two blocks sitting out.]"
1,Knives rust in first washing,After I used them ONCE and washed them in the dishwasher the blades rusted! That's unacceptable. I have cheap stainless steal steak knifes I've had for 25 years that have NEVER rusted in the dishwasher. The box says dishwasher safe although in small print it says not recommended. Now I know why. They are inferior.I purchased these knifes thinking I was going to get something a cut above. They are not as good as a $10 set of Steak Knifes from a discount store. Save your money!I am returning mine.
2,Cute dress,I think it's way too big and lose on me but my boyfriend liked it. My waist is size 3 and bust is 34C.
4,Cute!,"Really cute little nightie that fits perfectly. Comes with a matching g-string which was a nice bonus. Not the best material in the world, but for the price, and the (hopefully) short amount of time it's worn it's perfect."
4,Great Outfit,Material seems to be of decent quality and one size fit well. So far this outfit was well worth the price :)
2,You get what you pay for,The lace around the neck was too long (2 ft). Can't imagine who can use if without custom modification. Overall poor quality.
2,horrible proportions,"I am a size 18-20 so I purchased this size, because it was to be in my size range. Once I tried it on, the bottom was perfect, but the top is HUGE!, I am a DD and the chest part hangs down almost to my belly button."
3,Eh,"The lace is surprisingly very soft...but it's not really anything special. I wasn't expecting a lot because of the price though. I had to tie the halter straps because they were too long. Normally I wear a size 16, so I got the plus size. I like the length, it just shows a little bit of my bum. But otherwise it's not thrilling. For the price, it's decent."
5,great,i loved this onei have ordered 5 different lingerie this was my favorite...its really soo cuteeeee . thnx
2,"Good price, but not quality","I was looking for a fun piece of lingerie and I found this. The reviews sounded good, however when I received it, I was disappointed. I am in the process of trying to get a refund."
4,Very cute,"This is cute and sexy, but it could be shorter. I should have ordered a smaller size but after washing and drying is perfect."
3,Nice for price,This product is a little scratchy. Looks good and fits good. I have very sensitive skin so most would probably not be bothered by the slightly rough texture.
1,Horrible fit,"Choosing something that's ""one size"" is always risky. I'm 5'3 and 120 lbs and this piece hung on me. Plus the halter was wayyyy too long. I had to tie a knot in the back so it wouldn't be super baggy, and even then the chest didn't quite fit right."
3,Not bad,"It's cute, but I'm petite (5'2"") so the dress is actully much longer on me than pictured on the model. I cut the back and turned it into a tie top and that made it look much nicer.Overall it's not a bad ""dress"", especially if you're taller.***I ordered the same in white and it is somehow shorter***"
4,hide and go peak,"This was a very nice ""mini dress"". The material was unexpectedly soft, and my husbands reaction was ""wow"". The lack of the 5th star was only due to the halter area of the outfit being a bit too loose. If you are looking for an inexpensive evening of fun, this item is a great investment!"
2,Too stretchy made for poor fit,"I wear a size 18, so I wasn't sure if I should get this in the regular size (90-160 lbs.) or Plus size. I got it in the regular, and it was too big. The top was too stretchy. I am a 38 DDD and I was surprised it was too big. The halter would have been better if it had 2 ties. There was no way to adjust it."
3,Need a better sizing chart,"I've never purchased lingerie online before and after browsing several and reading other reviews, I went with this one in the red color. I read carefully what I thought would be the correct choice for my size (about a size 10/12) and found that after receiving it, it is a very stretchy material. In fact the halter part of the dress is too long and I had to tie it to make it fit better. I could have gone down a size and it would have worked a little better. However, my boyfriend didn't complain when he saw it. Overall pretty comfortable and nice material."
2,I guess I do not have the body for this,"It looked awkward on me. The mini dress was not a nice snug sexy fit, it was baggy on me and not flattering at all. Would not buy again."
3,"The model looks great, but...","I think the fit displayed is way off and ""Plus Size"" doesn't even begin to describe the cut. If you purchase this item, plan on tying a knot in the neck area or taking it in a bit. After a few adjustments it proved to be acceptable."
2,Too big,"I'm short (4'10) and didn't pay attention that it was halter. No big deal as its stretchy and could tie it up to where it should be. I'm also thin (size 2) and only a B cup, meaning that even with it tied back the front was longer than the back that was too short (I have a booty) and only came down to about half of where my butt was. It fit comfortably, though slightly loose. I'm going to try and wash it on delicate and shrink it. For the price it was worth the chance to see if it fit, but as this is my first elegant moments purchase, don't think I'll be buying more of the brand. Leg Avenue is just as cheap and tends to fit better."
4,Very cute & sexy!,"One size fits all does not apply! I am 4' 11"" and 95lbs....swallowed me! But on a good note my husband loved it!"
2,Not so happy,"I'm dissapointed ,the alter lace was very long, i have to tie it in a knot. It is also loose on the back.I hope that it will shrink some after washing it. It's not worth my time to mail it back, so i'll keep it and make the best of it."
3,Its cute,It's a cute little get up but unless you have huge boobs it's basically meh. In this case one size does not fit all. But with a little adjusting I was able to make it work... but it's not going to be making many more appearances.
4,Great Mother Goose,A great Mother Goose experience for child and reader alike -- sturdy colorful pages. Only one poem per page.
5,Great baby gift!,This is one of the most beautiful Mother Goose books I have ever come across! The illustrations coupled with the classic Mother Goose rhymes make it a wonderful baby gift - one that is sure to be a keepsake!
1,Very disappointing,"I bought this because it got so many rave reviews and was pretty disappointed. Much of the original text of these rhymes were missing, and I realized too late that animals don't really replace people. I was happy to pick up a used copy of The Original Mother Goose, with all the nursery rhymes I had as a child."
5,Funny Horror Flick,Jack Frost is a funny movie. I never laughed so hard at a horror movie. The characters were just ridiculously stupid and the whole plot was just wack. I just bought this movie. I'll definitely have many more laughs to come!!
1,unbelievably downright laughable,This is simply one of the absolute WORST movies ever made. AVOID like herpes.
4,A masterpiece!,"Boy, what a movie! If you've ever wondered what it would be like to see a psychotic snowman wreak havoc and murder on the population of a small town, look no further! In terms of concept, this one is nearly as good as Killer Klowns from Outer Space. When you watch the tub scene, just ask yourself, where'd the carrot go?"
2,Now this is just terrible.,"Don't be mislead by the box cover. That hideous snowman with the green eyes and sharp teeth is never seen in the movie. Instead you got this giant, padded Frosty the Snowman made of styrofoam. There shouldn't be anyone credited with special effects in this flick. Even the actors can barely see the point of working with this snowman, he's more prop than character.Yes the best 'kill' of the movie was in the bathtub with the hot teenage chick, the idea was great, but the final product was terrible. Plus the snowman comes off with these Freddy Kruger type lines after each kill, but they just fall flat and are more stupid than funny. The 'star' of the movie is the local sheriff who has the acting skills of a third grader playing a tree in the class play. If you like bad movies like I do, even you'll agree that this flick is too bad to be called 'bad'."
4,"Real cheesy, but funny as h**l!","Alright, the movie starts off with the murderer Jack Frost, who's been taken to prison for execution. But then...a accident happens, and Jack gets killed...you think. Instead, he's now coming as a snowman to get his revenge on the cop who arrested him. Sounds cheese? Yes, it is. But it's also a really funny movie. I laughed my a** off at some of the killings. It's an ok gory film, so all you gore fans should be pleased. But don't expect to be scared."
1,Jack Frost: A little too stupid for me,"I always like a good cheesy horror flick but this is too much. I mean what was this suppose to be anyway a comedy or a horror movie. I think they did a terrible job trying to combine the two. The plot itself is even incredibly stupid. It's about a killer turned snowman going on a murder spree in a small town on christmas. This movie is not only poorly acted but also the death scenes are incredibly stupid. Your best bet would be to avoid this one, even if you are a die hard horror fan."
2,It's an average,"My sister and I watched the movie. She found it quite amusing and I found it stupid. I admit it was funny in some parts like that comment a kid made after the other kid's head got chopped off. The shower scene (which is why my sister wanted to give it 3 stars) was . . . there are no words. It was hard to believe that 4 small hair dryers could melt a 7 foot snowman. The funniest part was the man who destroyed all the contest snowmen after he saw Jack Frost kill that woman. If you like campy, watch it. If you don't, don't."
1,You've gotta be kiddin' me...,"Was this a movie? Well, if it was, it's the worst one I've ever seen in my entire life! Oh, my God, this movie was so...so...terrible! The acting was absolutely ridiculous, the special effects were sooooo stupid and cheesy, the story was about as deep as a rain puddle and the cinematography was absolutely laughable (there's one scene where the camera zooms in and out from the snowman's face repeatedly, and it was so stupid it was funny!) This movie is pure Ed Wood material and I put it with other bottom-of-the-barrel movies like: Plan 9 From Outer Space."
1,not that good,"this movie wasn't what it was hyped up to be I found that the actin was pretty bad, and the effects pretty easy to see that they weren't that good."
1,One of the Worst Horror Movies I Have Ever Seen,"This movie is so bad it is unbelivable,it has some horrible special effects and some bad acting. I think the scene where the snowman is raping the girl is really appalling. I loathe this movie and this trash will probably produce a sequel just as bad or worse"
2,"Weak, even for B horror","I was very disapointed with Jack Frost. I rented it years ago when it was a new release in the video store and really enjoyed it. I even bought it but never popped it in until recently. This time around my opinion changed big time. I'm not sure what I was thinking when I originally thought it was so great. It really was awful. I am a big fan of B movies but this was just too goofy. I wasn't expecting much, but this didn't do anything for me. I think it's the best when a movie really tries to be serious but is too ridiculous to be anything but funny. But when a movie knows it's so bad they try to make it funny is a different story. As much as I'd love to love a movie about a killer snowman, I just can't. I'd pass on this if you have the chance."
1,Complete and Utter Trash!!!,"I absolutley love a ""so bad it's good"" movie,but this film is not only bad,it's also very sick and disturbing.The people who made this vile movie,must think that rape is something to laugh at and to find funny.Well,there is NOTHING humorous about rape.I say this,because in one scene it shows a woman being violenty raped by the killer snowman's ""carrot"".This is the most digusting thing I have ever seen in a ANY movie.The rest of the film is garbage too.Some of the most gruesome deaths I have ever seen in my life during a horror film.Overall,this movie is below low.It's a downright disgrace.I would rather watch the old time horror flicks over this any day.Such as Frankenstein,The Mummy or maybe Wolfman.Now THOSE were good horror flicks.Not immoral trash like this.I would also watch Micheal Keaton's Jack Frost movie over this vile mess too!"
1,"Stupid, yet so funny...","Okay, this is probably the stupidest movie I and my sister Jane think we've ever seen. We are bad movie conniessuers, and we know from personal experience just how awful some moveis can be.But Jack Frost is so stupid, we actually kind of liked it in a way, just because it made us laugh. Imagine, a giant possessed snowman out for revenge! Yeah, we thought it was ridiculous too. And to top it off, the movie's acting and special effects (if you can call them that) were just about as ridiculous as its storyline.But it was these facts that made us love it to death, and therefore I'm going to recommend Jack Frost to all you B-movie lovers out there. A-Pix entertainment is the king of all stupid movies, and I heart them anyway...."
5,HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!,This movie is the best. The scene with the kid getting kill by the sled is the stupiest/funniest thing I've ever seen. This movie ranks right up with Evil Dead 2. But I've had many comments while watching it that the girl in the shower scene should've showed more skin. But it was still a great flick and anyone with a sense of humor would enjoy it!
1,Probably the dumbest movie ever....,"""He's Chillin' and He's Killin""....Sure, it provided some entertainment on a snowy Boston Saturday afternoon, but this is most likely the worst movie I have ever seen. My friends and I could have made better..... However, any movie that has a snowman having sex with a girl, using a carrot as his you-know-what, has to deserve at least one star....."
1,"It was the stupidest movie I have seen in my life it, stunk.",I hated it nothing in the movie looked real. I would not even give this movie one star the only reason I did not rate movie lower than one star was because they only had the choses of one star to five stars. If you want a scary movie dont get this one
3,Jack Frost is so bad...its Good,"I ponder, how so many people can be involved in such a cheesie B movie. My Kid brother could have made better props. The film being shot in the middle of summer was the depressing part. But the Corny lines and that carrot shower scene deserves and Oscar"
2,Good for a laugh! :),Jack Frost isn't the greatest film of all time but it is good if you're story is just unbelievable (worth one star) and just made me laugh to see
1,Oh my goodness,"Ok, I like this movie b/c it is SO terrible. It's not a scary movie @ all, it is hillarious! That kid is played by a 12-yr old, playing an 8 yr-old, acting like a 6 yr-old. And then... anti-freeze in the oatmeal?! What in the hell?!!!! This has to be the absolutely worst movie ever made. It's almost worth renting it's so bad."
3,Like a Train Wreck,"Okay, this movie was horrible, but...I couldn't stop watching!That being said, it HAS to be seen at LEAST once. It's like...MST3000 worthy! Yet, it's still funny enough on it's own. It's considered a horror movie, but I spent more time laughing than anything.This is one wacky movie."
2,Jack Frost Starring Shannon Elizabeth. Who knew this would be the high point of her career?,"We, Sid the Elf, have been very excited about kicking off the Christmas B season and decided to open up with Jack Frost. Many years ago Sid saw Jack Frost when it was a new release at his local video store and really enjoyed it's straight to VHS goodness. Unfortunately it did not stand the test of time like we expected. I'm not sure exactly what went wrong? Horror B used to be the tops. Now it is hard to even sit through a full viewing. I guess Sid has just matured and really needs some sweet explosions and neck snappings to get his bull running. After viewing timeless works of art like ""Total Recall"", ""Predator,"" and ""Out For Justice"" Jack Frost just seems obsolete.As much as we would like to, we just can't recommend Jack Frost. It seems as if this one started the trend of horror movies that know they are so bad they have to try to make them funny, which has single handedly ruined the genre."
4,A bad movie that's supposed to be bad,This movie is funny because it's bad and ridiculous. It belongs next to your copy of Evil Dead.
1,I laughed so hard!,"This has got to be the single worst movie ive ever seen. The acting is terrible, the storyline is cheezy, and the things they fight him off with are stupid! But I laughed so hard I made all my friends see it all I have to say is I wish they still made MST3K cause this would be the perfect movie for them to tease!"
2,"A laugh or two, extremely stupid","Really bad movie. I could do better production. If I ever become a movie producer though, I will try to remake it with good decent effects like the other Jack Frost movie. It's not really very scary. They could have tried a little harder, but to their credit, it's pretty impossible to make a snowman scary. Santa, yes; Clown, definitely; Snowman, no, not going to happy. You might as well make a killer gingerbread man. If you want a funny as hell bad horror movie, get the first Leprechaun."
4,This movie is awesome!,"Okay so the plot is kinda screwed up but hey!its horror its comedy and its reccomended!with the right ammount of gore,a sense of humour,and a touch of horror this film rocks!i, mean who would think up a killer snow-man! its rated R,gore fans will be impressed!its just a cool movie,but for the plot i gave it 4 stars."
1,"Have a holly, jolly Christmas. If you're going to hell","Serial killer escapes death when his execution van crosses paths with a truck containing voitile chemicals and becomes a nasty mutant snowman. He then rampages through a small town, murdering innocent people until he gets the cop responsible for putting him behind bars. Sicker than the average low budgeter and if you don't take it seriously, you might lose your ability to comprehend reality. The opening credits are chilling, though."
3,Goes through the motions of a standard slasher movie!,"As the title indicates; this, i.e., Jack Frost (1997) VHS ~ Michael Cooney that ""Goes through the motions of a standard slasher movie!"". What I mean by this is that we have the standard plot, e.g., tons of gore, bad acting, cheesy lines and a budget that is weak at best. However, I still give this movie three stars since it does not sink to the abonimable level thatother horror flicks do, e.g., Childs Play III and therefore can not be called a complete failure. If you know what you are about see, i.e., a typical slaher flick and you do not come in with any hopes of stellar acting or a well written script; then this movie is for you."
1,Beyond Stupid movie,"This movie is soooooooooooo terrible...i rented it a long time ago and was very disappointed, bad acting at its best!!! The snowman wasnt even scary to say the less...my 6 year old son watched it with me and he was laughting rather then being scared!! i wouldnt spend a penny on this movie!!!"
5,gorey fun witha twist,pretty freaky and fun movie with killer snowman saying some killer sayings and killing people in harsh ways
4,"Fair casserole, but it is what it is","This really isn't a dutch oven or the equivalent thereof. It's a casserole dish and decent for them as well as making candy, actually. The thicker bottom distributes heat pretty nicely and the thin sides don't make too much of a difference, but allows things to cool rather quickly when you take it off the burner.That being said, for die hard calphalon professional fans, don't get this, you'll be disappointed by the weight and make. It's a 'starter' piece of calphalon."
2,Skimpy!!! Thin and sub-standard.,"Wow! I can't believe how THIN the sides are... and how generally unsubstantial this pot feels. I guess you get what you pay for... 19 bucks worth of product stretched as far as it will go. Usually I look at my calphlon with pride, but I think I'll be hiding this one in the back of the cupboard. I'm sure EVERYONE will think it's a cheap knockoff from ebay. What's wrong Amazon? Aren't you checking out your sources?"
3,Is this pot induction ready,This is more of a question and not a review. I would like to know if you can use this pot on an induction cooktop? Would appreciate some feedback. Thanks.
4,calphalon 7-qt chef's casserole,"The design, size and shape of the pan are great. I was somewhat disappointed to find the quality not the same as the other calphalon pans I've purchased in the past from Amazon. This pan was much thinner, and was also made in China, not USA as the previous ones I bought."
1,"Flimsy, flimsy, flimsy!","Over the past three months, I have purchased about 20 pieces of Calphalon's Commercial Hard Anodized series through Amazon.com. These pieces have been both Toledo and Chinese manufacture. Overall, I have been thrilled with what I've received. Except this time.The 7 qt. Chef's Casserole was, and there's no other way to put it, flimsy. Certainly flimsy by comparison to all my other pieces. The pot was less than half the thickness of all the other pieces I've ordered from this line. It appeared that they had made the main pot from the same material as the lids. It was that thin. Less than 2 mm thick. As a side note, this piece was Chinese manfacture.I consider this to be defective merchandise and will be dropping it off at a UPS Store for return it to Amazon within the next 24 hours."
4,Great Pan,I just ordered this pan and received it last night. I cooked some soup in it and it turned out great. The pan was thinner than I had imagined from the photo but it was not an issue because the heat distributed evenly and the cleanup was easy. It's a great value for the price.
2,so so,"Like the other reviewers, I would say, beware. this is not like the other commercial calphalon pots I have owned. It is VERY thin, and made in China rather than in the U.S. like the better Calphalon models. For $19.99, I guess it is okay, but you do get what you pay for."
5,Another great pan,"I recently purchased this pan and have used it on several occasions, and each time the casserole has proven an invaluable buy. It's great for stews, braised dishes (like lamb shanks or osso bucco) and even plain ol' pasta. Cleaning up hasn't been much of a hassle, either, despite what some folks say about the difficulty of keeping Calphalon Hard Anodized stuff clean.It's a great multi-purpose pan...a bit on the expensive side, but a tremendous investment for the home cook."
4,A true value,"This is a good size pot! I've got pots of every shape and size, and each one has its specific uses. Sometimes you need one a little (or lot) bigger, sometimes you need one smaller. This one is JUST RIGHT for so many things! I love it!"
3,Made in China???,"Just received my new pan. It's lighter (and thinner) than I expected. My question is why was it made in China? Is everything we use in our lives going to be outsourced to a foreign country just to save a few bucks? Hey Calphalon>>>>get a clue, Americans need jobs too. You've seen my last American dollar!"
5,"Sharon in Seattle, WA",What can I say? Calphalon can't be beat. I received the Hard-Anodized 7-Qt Chef's Casserole as a birthday present. I love it! It cooks so evenly and is always a breeze to clean. I would recommend it to anyone.
5,Incredible,"I Love my 7 quart casserole pot!!! It does such a nice job and I don't have to ""kick up"" the heat with this product and I can get a GREAT meal from it."
2,Price was great - but not necessarily the pot!,"This pot may be perfect for stove top - soups, stews, chili, but we baked augratin potatoes in it (They turned out great) and the pot needed 24 hours of soaking and scraping before coming clean, with a good deal of elbow grease."
1,new calphalon cookware disappoints,"I just received the new commercial quality, caphalon 7 qt chef's casserole. at least, that's what amazon advertised. instead of the heavy, high quality caphalon I've purchased in the past, which is made in toledo, ohio, I opened the box and discovered a cheap imitation, made in china. it feels like tin--the difference between the american made pan and this pan made in china is immediately perceptible. I'd send it back, but the return postage is nearly the same price as the order. I'm storing the pot in the garage, where it belongs.don't be fooled by I was by the price. you get less than what you pay for."
1,Disapointed,I am disapointed with the casserole. It is very light as opposed to substantial as are their other products. The interior is rough. The handles look like an afterthought and are not properly sized for the pot. It's cheezy.
3,Thinnest calphalon pan I own,"The shape is nice, the design is good, but the thickness of the pan is very thin on the sides, but thicker on the bottom. Maybe somebody could argue that this puts the heavy metal on the bottom where it is useful and saves weight where it isn't needed, but I'm afraid that I'll dent this thing if I drop it or mishandle it by accident. The metal at the rim is only about 2mm or less I'd guess. I'm used to old heavy duty Calphalon commercial pots, so this one was a surprise... but it was also much less expensive than the ones I bought years ago, so since this isn't one of my workhorses but something I use when cooking for more people, I guess I'll live with it. It isn't a bad pan, it just has less material than you would expect if you have some of the older calphalon commercial stuff from years ago. I'd recommend it for someone in my situation, who needs a pot of this volume and shape for occasional use."
3,Middle of the Road,I have been purchasing the commercial line and this is the thinnest pot in the line (so far). The rivets are much smaller also. I am not impressed with this and would not recommend this item as I have the others in the commercial line.
2,A disappointment,"I have a number of Calphalon H-A pieces. Some are high-end, others are from the lower priced lines. While I've always noticed the difference in quality in the lower priced pieces, I've considered that to be a trade-off for the reduced price. This dutch oven is a disappointment even by the lower standard. As other reviewers have mentioned, the pan is extremely thin. Worse, the first time I cooked in the pan the interior surface seemed to wear away leaving irregular, shiny marks. Other discounted pieces (especially the 12"" everyday pan) hold up well over time, but this one seems to be a dud.As a side note, Calphalon is willing to examine any pan to determine if a replacement is warranted, but after shipping costs it's hardly worth the effort to send it in."
5,Read the Description!,"This pot is meant for quick searing/braisng on the stove , THEN IT IS MEANT TO GO INTO OVEN. It is thin for even heatingIN AN OVEN. If you want to cook on the a stove top, get stock pot or sauce pan."
2,Worst Calphalon pot,"It's a worst piece of Calphalon Commercial line I have owned. The pan has good size (only 10"" foot print) but very thin. Like the other reviewer, the first time I have boiled a large piece of chicken breast in the pan,the interior surface at the bottom seemed to wear away leaving irregular, shiny permanent stain marks. I don't cook acidic food at all. I wish I can return this pot."
2,"CALPHALON, NOT THAT HOT ANYMORE","I HAVE OWNED CALPHALON PRODUCTS FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS.THE POTS AND PANS ARE NO LONGER MADE IN TOLEDO,OHIO BUT IN CHINA.THE OVER ALL QUALITY HAS DROPPED.THEY USE TO MAKE THE POTS AND PANS WITH HEAVYWEIGHT ALUMMINUM,NOW THEY ARE MADE WITH THINER STOCK AND HAVE A FLIMSY FEEL TO THEM."
5,A very satisfied user.,"I am a big fan of the Calphalon Commercial Hard-Anodized line of cookware. This piece was no disappointment. It's fabulous...The price was right, delivery was fast. I like these pieces because they cook evenly and the clean-up is a snap."
5,"Great songs, great album!!","This is a really great album if you want all of Jethro Tull's big, chart-topping hits. My personal favorite is ""Living In The Past."" All of the other songs on here are worth the buy ""Bungle In The Jungle"" and a short version of ""Thick As A Brick."" If you are a new fan of Tull, this would be a great cd to pick up for starters. Enjoy!"
4,Skimming the gleaming surface of the Tull oeuvre,"This compilation covers what was for many Tull fans the band's most productive period, 1969-77. Don't expect a full-length CD compilation: this album was first released on a single LP, so it clocks in at rather less than 55 minutes.Twelve tracks can do scant justice to almost as many albums that Tull recorded during the period, but it is a fine selection. 'Thick as a Brick' is cut woefully short of its last 35 minutes, but if this sample persuades new listeners to buy the full-length album, then it has done it job. Anderson thankfully avoided the temptation to ship the abbreviated single version of 'Minstrel in the Gallery', which was essentially just the electric section.There must something on this album, which is probably the best entry point for anyone new to Tull, to appeal to almost everyone. If you like this, then I would strongly recommend AQUALUNG, MINSTREL IN THE GALLERY and THICK AS A BRICK."
2,"Great Music, what happened to the mix?","I grew up with this music, went and saw them several times in concert. I love this stuff, but how did they push Ian Anderson's vocals into the back, particularly in the Aqualung tracks. This disc has lost much of the urgency that was a Tull hallmark. I have most of this music in either vinyl or CD, and they just don't sound this way. If you like Tull do yourself a favor and try one of the other discs, otherwise you might think you are loosing your hearing."
4,Jethro Tull - 101,"If you are not a Tull fan or never heard Tull before , this is the perfect CD for you. ""Too old to rock and roll, Too young to die"" is worth your money.Placing Locomotive Breath between Too old.. and Skating away... is a sin. The mood shift is unimaginable. Program your player such that #4 plays last or never. Its a beautiful song with great lyrics, but I would have loved to see Cross Eyed Mary instead.Listen carefully to the lyrics of Songs from the Wood, Thick as a Brick and Minstrel in the gallery. Tull is about poetry of images.The CD has songs recorded since '69 and the quality is very good."
5,Techniques That You Can Use In Your Classroom Tomorrow,"I have been studying learning styles for the past six months, and I have never found a book that was this user-friendly. You could honestly pick up this book with no prior knowledge and start using learning styles and multiple intelligences into your classroom tomorrow. There is a brief overview of Myers-Briggs' learning styles and Gardener's multiple intelligences theories. The authors show how the two theories inter-relate. The remaining three chapters takes you through the process of bringing the theories into practice in your classroom. It is an extrememly easy and exciting read. I have made it through the book in two days of light reading. Also, this will not be a book you read once, and never pick up again; you will want to reread the material over and over again."
3,Okay Book,"I purchased this book because I wanted specific activities I could use in my primary classroom. Half of the book's content was persuasion on why it was important to use various learning styles. I did not need to be persuaded so this was a waste for me. There are a few pages that will benefit my classroom, but not the majority of the book. If you're looking for a Silver & Strong book that will be useful, try their ""Tools for Promoting Active, Indepth Learning"". It's much better than this one."
3,Nice big size; holds lots of water:,"The only con is that after several uses, you will see stress fractures in the plastic where you sit; the pressure makes it look cracked, but it isn't/ It holds lots of hot water, with a very large well; much better than most, yes, I would buy this again!"
4,not an exact fit,"nice item but it is about 1/16""-1/8"" to long, I will have to shorten it to make it fit like it is suppose to"
1,disappointed with product,ive been looking for a pair of booties for my slide reebok that i thought these were very similar to but the material is much too stiff i thought they were some type of spandex and they are not. good service otherwise. got here fast.
4,satisfied,I like the stainless steel jar for my blender. I've gone through several glass jars and they always seem to break. The stainless steel jar fit my blender as advertised. The down side is it not as large as the glass jar I replaced.
4,Great!!!,"We are using the blender almost daily with frozen ice cubes and it works still perfect. Sometimes the food gets stuck and you have to manually shake ot loose, but you need to add sufficient water as well."
5,So handy,"I have been using the metal container for making all kinds of things, from shakes to soup they have all turned out great. The only negative is that the plastic lid is pretty cheaply made and not the greatest fit."
3,Malt Jar........,"Always Bargain and Amazon did their thing. Now we're doing our thing, making great malts. Chocolate, Carmel, Strawberry and with more to come. We also got the malt/milkshake blade to go with it. Kinda p---ed we are, that we had to order the malt blade separate. But what tha heck! Ya gotta do what ya gotta do. At least we're having tha best MALTS in town now.................. Grandpa, grandma and tha grandbabies is happy, happy now................. Even if they did shaft us a bit on tha price.............. Who wants a malt/milkshake jar with a blender blade, nobody................. Tha glass/plastic jar that comes with tha blender has a blender blade.................."
2,Cheaply Made,"I ordered this item to mix drinks in. However, the lid leaks when you shake the container. The metal is very lightweight, but the mixer blade that fits the bottom is standard for Oster, and is useful as a replacement component."
3,Good product,"Good product, but may want to purchase the ice blade because the blade it comes with doesn't do a very good job on the frozen drinks."
1,Loose fitting lid and small gasket,The lid does not seat tightly on the jar. This is a major problem when blending liquids. Also the gasket is the smallest I have seen on this type of blender.Not recommended
2,Half an order,I received this without a rubber seal ring or the screw-on bottom piece. The quality of what I *did* receive seems good.
2,Stainless steel blender jar package,"Everything was in fine condition. Only problem is, the plastic seat locking jar to original blender was cheap and also doesn't fit properly. I've probably wasted my money and will have to buy a new blender anyway. This is the second seat I purchased from Goodmans with same issue.. The problem is the cheap plastic knockoff components. They are low quality, not like the original components. My blender base is the Osterizer Classic, one of the blenders these ""replacement"" parts were specifically designed for. Maybe I'll have to go on EBay and try to find an original seat to salvage the rest of the purchase."
4,Better than glass!,"This was a replacement for a glass blender jar that I broke. I love it. I think it looks cool and it won't break like the glass one did. I will say that the price I paid ended up being about the same as I would've paid for a NEW low-end blender from this company. I just hated the thought of throwing away a perfectly good blender motor.But what can I say, it's a blender part. I can't be TOO excited for a blender part. ;)"
4,Pretty Darn Good,"And that's just what it is. I saw another review that said they use it for protein shakes, and mine purpose is not too terribly different. I do a blended coffee drink every morning instead of plunking down $4-5 at the local coffee shop and the blender's glass jar just wasn't cutting it. So I grabbed this one and gave it a whirl (so to speak). I would have given it 5 stars but I've got the Oster blender that has the reversing motor thingy and when I used it as it was shipped it reversed the blade right off! (there's a nut underneath holding it all, and apparently when the motor goes forward everything works as it's supposed to...but when it goes in reverse it unscrews itself!! So I swapped back to my original blade from the glass jar and it all works wonderfully. Minor monkeying aside, it's solid and works well. The only other thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars was the lack of measuring markings (cups, oz, whatever) that the glass jar always has."
4,An okay systematic overview,"Though this book is a pretty good systematic theology overview revolving around the theme of the Trinity it is difficult at times to read. Though classical in its positioning, Gunton provides a very moderate evangelical perspective on standard systematic theology topics. Many will complain that Gunton likes to tread the middle path than landing his two feet on either side of the road. In fact, a conservative evangelical will consider Gunton ""soft,"" while a liberal theologian will consider his views outdated. Despite this, the book is still useful for seminary students or ministers who need a quick reference on the standard topics of systematic theology."
4,I haven't used better,"This knife was a big move up for us. Much better than the slicer in our block of knives. 4 and a half stars only because it dragged a tad more than I expected. I can see an advantage for a knife with a little more flex (and thinner blade), but this knife was the right knife for the price."
1,ITS NOT THE SAME!!!,"I couldnt wait till this arrived in the post but as soon as I started to play, it was like the mortal kombat version of ds games.......SUPER FAST!!!! its like playing the hardest level right from the start.....there is no build up.....i couldnt play more than 5 minutes....very frustrating!!! if there is anyway to reduce the speeds, please somebody let me know or i'm sending this back!!!"
5,Was a gift,"I purchased this game for a child. He loved it, he plays it more than the other games he has. It was easy for him to learn, play. Definately great game, great price and super fast delivery. Thank you so much!!!"
5,Takes me back!,"This game is great. I have only played packman so far but it is addicting. Everything is just as it was when these games first came out. The graphics are good, very true to the original but not poor for the DS. I really like this game vault and recommend it for everyone."
4,Brings me back to my childhood!,"Our daughter wanted this for her DSI. We found it and then were afraid it might only be compatible with the DS. As it turns out, it works just fine. The catch was that you go into the game from the Arcade icon, not from the PacMan icon. - This of course makes no sense whatsoever as far as I'm concerned. But it works!! The game is terrific. A little hard to maneuver with the little arrow buttons on her DSI, but over all, we are extremely happy with this game!"
3,Namco,Good product for the price. On Galaga some of the numbers are cut off at the bottom...doesn't seem like that should be happening in 2009.
2,Buttons not manageable....,"Okay, as a big fan of the old arcade games, especially Galaga and Galaxian, and I'm very good at both, it is very hard to play them as we do (did) in the arcade on this game system. The buttons are too small to use with adult fingers in playing these games. The shooting for Galaxian and Galaga is very subpar, not much shooting power so to speak. I was very much looking forward to this game of the lot I bought for my DS but this one bites the dust, sadly. My young son plays them better (smaller fingers)."
2,It's just okay,"As I love the old school games, I find them hard to play on the DS. My daughter who I actually purchased the game for, just refuses to play them. She is 10 and said it is just not that much fun and finds is hard to use the buttons for this particular game. Oh well, win some and lose some. I'm not sorry I bought it... just will play once and a while."
4,A Nice Addition To Your DS Collection,"If you're over 35 this game will pleasantly refresh your memories. I enjoyed PacMan and Galaga back then and I get to enjoy them now. I wish this game had Dig Dug 1 not Dig Dug 2, but overall this is a fun DS game to own. The sound and graphics quality of video games over the last 10 years are phenominal and they continue to improve! If you're young you may think the Namco Museum Games are somewhat plain compared to all the latest video games. You'll be right, but you'll be missing the point of Namco Museum. Video games from 1979 thru 1985 were new. Pac Man, Galaga, Space Invaders, Dig Dug, Asteroids, Missile Command, Lunar Lander, and a few others were the best in their day. Namco Museum captures some of that old time nostalgia and if you enjoyed playing some of those old games back then, you'll be glad to own Namco Museum now. Have fun!"
4,Back in the day games,"I bought this for my 6-year-old son for Christmas, along with a ds lite and the star wars lego game. The games themselves are fun and just as I remembered from my teen years. Getting to the games themselves is a little confusing. My son especially enjoys pacman."
1,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed in this game. I thought I was going to be able to play pacman. BUT, you can only play with a second individual. Hence, there is only one arcade game."
1,Yawn So Boring...........,I always loved Pac Man and bought this game for my DS. When I played it I knew I had wasted my money on a piece of garbage. I wish it would be better although some of it is in a diffrent launguage. I just asked my neighbor to tell me what it said. But I do not reccomend it to anyone.
1,Dissapointed Costumer...,"Terrible!!!!!!!!!! when I recieved this game and play it, is not even working I try multiple DS but stil not running, I dump the game in the garbage, I waisted my money and time purchasing this game....Dissapointed....."
5,Came in time,I was happy with the price and it came in the mail just in time. I could not be any more happier with the sevice
4,Not Bad,"I love being able to play classic games that i grew up with. However, the only reason i can't give this nostalgic game bundle 5 stars is because of Dig Dug 2. What's up with that? It sucks compared to the original Dig Dug. /:"
3,Namco Museum is okay.,"I have played this only a couple of times, thinking to bring back ""good times"" from back in the day. It didn't happen. I will probably play it once in a while, though."
5,Namco Museum,"I was so tickled to be able to introduce my daughter to the great PacMan game that I so loved when I was younger. She loves it as well. Your child will too. A great price for years of entertainment. Once you have this, you will never want to sell it, believe me. You will be able to enjoy time together with your child because you will both end up playing it."
3,It's okay to play when you're super bored,"My children enjoyed this game, but weren't crazy about it and I guess because it's too old school for them. However, I enjoyed playing it!"
4,Great way to remember some of the best classics,"If you played all this games at the arcade, you will surely like this game.Still, new comers might find it not so appealing."
5,Onward empire,"Nice work. I used some of its insights in my own _Iraq 2003: Causes and Consequences of an Imperial Expedition_ (Editions Tour Blanche, 2007), and my _A History of the British Conquest of Afghanistan and Western India, 1838-49_ (Lewiston, NY: The Edwin Mellen Press, 2009)."
5,I LOVE THIS BOOK!,"This is a MUST READ for everyone. MJH takes you on a seamless journey of the heartbreak of betrayal of a first love and a ""best friend"" to how feelings left with no closure can come back and sting as if it were the initial wound. Lizan Mitchell knocked the narration out of the box, bringing younger Suvie to life with gripping emotions of a devastated heart, and the evil-plotting Dorothy.I listen to this book often on recorded books and still connect with the characters as if it were the first time.Beautifully written!Alya"
4,You Can Never Turn Back the Hands of Time,"I loved this book. Margaret has done it again! From the very start Margaret draws you into the mind of Sylvia-a woman who is still living with one foot in the past and the other in the present. Phil, and old high school love who she wished things would have been different, but a surprising event happened that sent her, Phil, and her best friend Dorothy on a rollercoaster ride that last for years. Phil wants Sylvia back, and Sylvia is curious about her old love- a situation happens that turns Sylvia's current marriage and family upside down. In addition, to problems they already have with their two daughters. One has a eating disorder and the other is very promiscious.The reason I give it four stars instead of five is because I felt the ending was complacent. Phil settled for what he had because he couldn't get what he wanted. The marriage with he and Dorothy seemed destined for divorce. Both settled because both of them felt needy."
3,Too Much Pain!!!!!!!!!,I am sorry but I don't agree with the other reviewers. This book is so sad. It was filled with so much pain. I have read books that have made me cry but there was also laughter and family coming together as well. This family to me never really seemed to pull it together. Which means that for twenty years they were living on twigs. I don't know This read just didn't vibe with me. I will still read MJHodge because the sister can still write. But I was not happy with this book.
3,DISAPPOINTED,"This was a very,very sad story. But for som reason, I couldn't put the book down.I was very disappointed in how this book ended. I really thought at some point Dorothy would've paid a heavy price for what she'd done to Sylvia and Phillip. Instead things turned out for her just as she'd planed: The man of her dream(although he doesn't feel the same way about her),and a big beautiful home, while phillip long to be with his true love and Sylvia setttles for a man she doesn't really love.I really hope that the author is working on a sequel to this book."
5,beautifully written,"I have read and enjoyed all of Margaret Johnson Hodge books but for some reason this touched a special place in my heart. For anyone who has gone on to be a wife and mother but wondered and secretly dreamed about that first love that got way this will awaken your senses as you remember but it will also bring you to your senses. Our feaured lady in the story has a chance to go back and the choices she makes, the consequences of those choices will have you reading it and living it until the last page. I loved it."
5,Good for learning how to trade!,"I read Jake's book, and it really helped me learn the basics of day trading. His explainations are clear and concise, they are reenforced with ample charts and diagrams. I reccomend this book for new traders and experienced traders alike!"
3,Worth the Money.,"The Compleat Day Trader is not for anyone unfamiliar with the stock market. It strength lies in it's ability to introduce concepts that later will need more research. I have found the book valuable in introducing concepts, then using other outlets to investigate these concepts further. The author DOES NOT fully explain many of his concepts, and how to figure them, for example, stochastics. Not for the new day trader."
3,"Nice book. Long on theory, short on fact.","I read this book with interest. It gives a brief overview of many trading tools and techniques. However, it was all theoretical. The author repeatedly claimed to have more than 20 years trading experience, yet he included no real examples of successful trades he made using any of the indicators or techniques touted in the book.The value I got from the book was the simple explanations of a number of indicators and theoretical usage of the indicators. I'll have to look elsewhere for practical, hands-on examples of how those indicators can be used in daytrading.This book is written for those wanting to trade S&P futures, commodities, or currencies. No mention of equities. Although I found the book interesting, it is far from ""complete."""
3,good for beginners,"Although very technical, this is a good basic text for beginners. It defines and describes many different types of indices and indicators that can be used whether trading S&P, commodities, or currencies. There are ample charts and examples to help the beginner understand concepts. The author never makes any promises of get rich quick schemes, so anyone looking for that should look somewhere else."
2,"Offers nothing new, offers useless new things","Well I don't recommend this book, it added nothing to me except a general knowledge of the intraday moves with no explanations. It is usefull only on the matter of gaps and again it offers nothing new at it"
1,Worthless and no practical value,I've applied Mr bernstein's systems and have lost all my money. It doesn't even read well in this book. You'll need more than this book to trade successfully--much luck.
2,Questionable book from questionable author,"Recent news is that the author, Jake Bernstein, has been disciplined and dethroned from trading futures because of his misleading TV infomercials. This throws his books into question.An excellent book to read instead is, ""Winner Takes All"" by Gallagher, an expose of the frauds of the investment world."
2,Nothing really useful,"This book is nothing more than a collection of general topics and vague assertions. Most of the information he gives can be found in other books in greater detail. The author provides few specific examples or statistics to back up most of his claims. The only thing new to me was the author's proprietary DSI. However, that data is only available through subscription. The chapter on DSI doesn't tell you anything about it except how great the data backtested against the S&P."
1,No useful information here.,What was the author thinking about? the central themes of this book contradicts its title.The best trading boo I've read so far is MIND OF A TRADER by PATEL. It is clearly the best book ever on trading.
1,"For traders with ""indicator"" obsession!","I picked up both the books in one day and was looking forward to finding out new information for trading. Essentially this book is filled with ""indicator"" information. This means he covers in great detail points in the chart such as Moving Averages, RSI, MACD, OBV, ROC, etc. Mr. Bernstein also believes that if one puts all the indicator info into a software, it can direct us when to buy and sell!It depends what kind of philosophy one has on trading. If one believes that trading can be automated then this book can be analyzed and programmed, otherwise if one thinks tomorrow's prices will be influenced by asian markets last night, then no point. The book suggests to track an intra day 3-minutes(!) Moving Average of a stock's price for optimal results. Personally I vote against this type of trading.I did not move onto the second book and returned both.Thank You, Steve."
3,Stochastic Pop is the best system,"Look, there a lot of great things about this book. But I guess I am a bit biased as I trade without indicators now. But to be honest, I *did* trade the Stochastic Pop for a few years and I found it to be quite profitable. I think this is a good book for traders who do not know where to start. But as a forex trader, I have seen better books, like the one on Naked Trading for Forex.I am sure Jake is a great trader, I have never seen him in person, but his book is a solid book for traders looking for trading systems, traders who want an intro to trading. But really, that is all this book is probably good for, to be completely honest."
1,I read the book once & never picked it up again,I like graphs & trying to interpret what they mean. At first glance this book seems to make sense with regard to helping time trades. There are many different styles of daytrading. For my style (both momentum trades & scalps) real time price graphs coupled with Level II quotes & time & sale data is more than enough. This books trys to make what should be simple into something more difficult. It recommends using mathmatical formulas (actually graphs that are a summary of mathmatical formulas) to enhance the timing of your buys & sells.I found the book worthless. I read it once & never bothered picking it up again. (Thats my definition of worthless).The books I refer back to time & again are the two charting books written by Barry Rudd. They seem to supply me with more than enough trading ideas.
1,Another feeble attempt to capitalize on day trading,Mr. Bernstein's work has been tested and the results are irrefutable--they just don't work. Commodity Traders Consumer Report rates his service are high double digit negative. Ride a different horse--try Larry Williams.
5,The best book out on day trading yet!,I found this book easy to read and full of the basic rules to day trading. Those who adhere to Mr. Bernstein's methodology are destined for success and in turn those who violate his cardinal rules will no doubt find failure. Each time I put his teachings into practice I reaped in the rewards. I have now made a successful career out of day trading and thank Mr. Bernstein for it!
2,"OK for the price, but not that great","The fact that the feet are bolted, not welded on, means this stand isn't really that sturdy at all. Even with no weight it wobbles. Not recommended."
3,excellent stand-bad customer service,"I ordered 6 of these stands since I teach a group keyboard class. The stands are excellent quality, nice and sturdy, easy to assemble, and the ""squeeze-trigger-easy-release"" makes them super easy to take up and down, which I do twice weekly! HOWEVER, I paid extra for expedited shipping since I needed them by a certain day, and they did NOT arrive on that particular day. I called the company and they said ""sorry, for some reason they were sent regular ground shipping so they should be there in 3 more days""...they SAID they would credit me for the additional shipping, which I have yet to see. Not great customer service!!!"
3,Pros & Cons,"Pros:-easy to assemble-adjustable height-light, not heavyCons:-shaking, not stable-need to disassemble if you're moving out-quite expensive"
4,i wish the lowest setting was lower,"i wish the lowest setting was lower, the high is nice n high, reasonable price yall, cheaper than the other ones, put it together right though"
5,Keyboard Stand supports my sons Yamaha,Works like it should. No issues it does what it was made to do. Amazon is great as usual. No complaints.
5,Coomer's books always moving,"From The Loop, to Apologizing To Dogs, to Beachcombing For A Shipwrecked God, and now One Vacant Chair, I always finde Joe Coomer's books engaging, witty, moving and lyrical. It's the writing that makes them so, a voice at once sophisticated and personal. His latest effort concerns a woman, Aunt Edna, who, beyond a career as an elementary school cafeteria worker, paints portraits of chairs. The story is narrated by her niece, who accompanies her on a trip from Fort Worth, Texas to Scotland, where they spread Aunt Edna's mother's ashes. This is a story of two women which takes on the classic storyline of mentor and student, but by the time the novel is finished these roles fall apart, become anything but typical. Any author who can make me laugh and cry within the space of one page makes me want to pass on the good word."
5,A Great Read,"This book works on so many different levels. It's a great read that's hard to put down once you start. It has wonderfully fleshed out characters who come to life on the page. The themes are compelling, and Coomer handles them with a strong sense of humor and sensitivity. The discussion of art technique adds another interesting dimension. All in all, I loved this book!"
5,Tell Your Friends,"Friends and family have been phoned and emailed with the rave review I've given this book. Funny, touching, sweet, and spicy---it has everything you hope a book will have, and then some. Realistic characters, great dialog and a realistic plot kept me reading well into the night. Tell your friends...they'll thank you."
3,Coastal Chill 05,"I enjoy all of the Coastal Chill Collection and found this one quite good but is not my favourite. It is not as good as the others, but in saying this, I am not saying it is a terrible cd, it is still very good to listen to. I actually enjoy some of the others more. I felt some of the songs on this one was not in the mood of the other Coastal Chills. I would still recommend it and to keep it for the collection."
5,top quality,"I've had many woks, the regular steel type that is high maint., and usually rusts on you, to stainless steel that everything sticks to. I've even had the calphalon 12"" wok. The problem with that one was the knob to the lid was attached by a piece of rubber that once it strips always falls off. The handle also wasn't like it should be for the price you pay for it. This one, however is worth the money. The lid has a sturdy riveted handle, and the the size of it keeps it from moving while your cooking. The food doesn't stick like you might expect, but seasons well."
1,Awful; just awful,"This slipper is awful build quality. I guess I have to believe when it says it's real elk leather, but it doesn't feel real; but much worse, it marks like a crayon when you walk on anything -- kitchen floors, hardwood floors, cement sidewalks -- anything! Dark blood red stains everywhere, and it looks like the bottom of the sole has been roughed up with a knife in no time. This is an atrocious quality product, not worth even a quarter of the already seemingly low price. It's rare that I'm moved to review a product, but the quality of this slipper is so bad, this was easily one of those time.s"
5,Big Joseph fan,"I have the Original Canadian Cast version with Donny Osmond, and I must say it is simply wonderful. My 3 year old even loves it and knows most of the words to the soundtrack all ready. The entire cast is well suited for their parts. I would highly recommend this soundtrack and video. Very family appropriate entertainment, although there is one ""suggestive"" scene with Potaphar's wife, however, not as suggestive as today's pop idol's videos!! Good, clean, and enjoyable!"
4,Joseph and the Techicolor Dreamcoat,It was just what we needed. The CD was in perfect condition. My daughter needed to learn the songs for a production of Joseph that she was in. She still loves to listen to it.Thanks
1,"This is o.k., but not as good as I had hoped for","I guess I was spoiled by seeing the Donny Osman version, this is o.k. but I will not be listening to it very often.I arrived on time and in excellent condition."
3,Average,"I think ""Joseph"" is an enjoyable listen as a whole. I mean, obviously Webber and Rice were just beginning to find their stride, so it's not as strong as some of their later stuff, but it is a good start. As far as this CD goes, I personally think the 'Joseph"" is a tad weak as a singer. I don't really know how to explain it. He isn't bad by any means, but it is only average. The 'narrator' is good though. It, as a whole, is a good interpretation of what I'm sure Webber and Rice had in mind."
4,Excellent,"The real star of this recording is Laurie Beechman. Her voice sparkles and her phrasing is excellent. The rest of the cast is fine but if you are a Laurie Beechman fan, this is essential to your collection."
4,A review of Joseph and his amazing technicolor dreamcoat,"I really do like the music in this musical,i especially like pharoah and joseph, that star and sing in it.The NARRATOR IS A BIT OVERPOWERING!, but it is a great musical for all ages especially children of around about my age.The brothers are great, and really do sing in their roles, and i love the way it all finishes with the finale song, 'any dream will do' overall it is a great m,usical and i really enjoyed it."
4,Pleasantly Surprise,"When I ordered this CD for my granddaughter a week before Christmas, I never dreamed I'd have it in time to wrap it and have it under the tree for her. But it arrived just in time! I have been looking for the version that I bought a few years ago and this isn't exactly it but it is close enough and I am very pleased."
5,Joseph,Great play and music. Follows along with the play. Wonderful. Energetic music. The traveling stage company is as good as the NYC broadway crew.
5,Worth it for the clever lyrics alone...,"Andy Webber and Tim Rice did this concept musical recording first, then produced ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" as a concept recording, and it swept the world. That was nearly 40 years ago. The success of Superstar led to the release of the Joseph score on Scepter Records, and the independent success of ""Joseph"" led to a stage version. While ""Superstar"" also has a stage version and was a popular movie, too, ""Joseph"" is more fun, and if you get a chance to attend a production, don't miss it. Its light tone and variety of musical styles make it a joy to see. The original Broadway cast version sounds just fine, although Donnie Osmond, who resurrected his career by playing Joseph, did not come along until later. Even after owning one version or another of this score for all these decades, I still enjoy an annual listen, because the writing is just so smile-producing."
1,Don't bother,bought 2. One did not print the other had leaked all it's ink into the foil pkg before I got it. When I opened it it dumped ink all over the carpet. Cost too little to even bother returning (or even asking) Thought I could go cheap did not work out. Sick of HP and their overpriced ink. Trashed the HP printer and bought a Cannon. 5 cartrage 250 page color refill costs $5.
1,Short on ink,I installed the cartridge in my HP printer and it didn't last for 50 pages before the cyan color ran out. Very distressing. I won't buy more from this dealer.
5,"Very Light, entertaining reading","This book will appeal more to the great lakes enthusiast who has an interest in Great Lakes and the ships that traverse their waters. This book is a compilation of several stories that Capt. McGrath lived out during his long and fruitful carreer in the great lakes shipping industry. If you are interested in the shipping industry, the great lakes, and the history of those two things, this book is for you!"
2,The Print Shop Deluxe cd ensemble,"It was an older version then the one I already had. Could not use it. It was from 1993, the one I have is 1995. I needed a version for windows vista"
1,For Mac only,"I will never know if I would like this software or not, because it is only for Mac. If you look really closely at the picture you can just make that out, but there is nothing in the description that would let you know that it isn't for PC."
4,Gorgeous,The watch is a beautiful piece. Th face is gorgeous with the crystal glass and such. The only downside is the bangle band takes some getting used to as it digs into your arm for the first couple wears. Otherwise I love the watch.
4,Interesting Story,"I saw the author of this book, Jack Cashill, on CSPAN 2, BookTV, this past weekend. He discussed this book and the life, career and death of Ron Brown and his relationship with the Clintons. He asked the audience to read the book and make up their own minds as to what happened to Ron Brown. But to him the evidence points to murder. The author looks to be in his late 50s, and was very well spoken.I have looked at this book in the bookstore, and have read small parts of it. After listening to the author I plan to buy the book and read all of it."
2,To change image of the product. It confuses to the buyer,this product is shipper for car. The image shows a very different product. It lets to me guide by the image and it buys of mistaken form
3,pas du fellini mais,mais ce drame d une fille agresse par plusieurs homes depeint un e realite brutale de ce que peuvent devenir les choses meme au royaume du quebec .
2,Not what I expected.,"First off I played the original Dark Fall game and loved it so when I found out there was a number 2 I had to get it. I expected it to be as great, mysterious, and dark as the first one; sadly however it wasn't. It starts out okay but goes down hill from there; the one thing that really ruined it for me was traveling to different times. It made no sense to have to gather clues in a different era. Overall the game was lacking in creativity, mystery, and a sense of darkness."
2,One of the worst games I've ever played!,"I really hated this game. I gave it two stars because the graphics are nice so that was the ONLY thing that kept me playing (and the fact that I hate to give up). But the game play was horrible. I hated that you could look at things that had no relation to the story or to help with puzzles. Why on earth would I want to look in an empty cubby or pick up a tea pot that was not used elsewhere?? The story is okay, but the music and the ""over here"", ""this way"" voices are annoying because they don't actually mean anything. Not to mention there is no closed caption and you can't figure out what people are saying in the few areas they do talk to you. The only interaction with other characters is contrived and boring. There was a lot of reading of materials that didn't really help move the story forward and could have been better done. The navigation was hopelessly annoying and very easy to get lost.Don't waste your money on this one. Play Syberia instead."
4,"Nice and creepy, but with some flaws","Lights Out started off as a good mystery. It was enjoyable to explore the creepy lighthouse, searching for clues re: the missing lightkeepers. There definately was a ghostly presence about. Also entertaining was the ability to travel in time, to see how the lighthouse existed in different time periods. For the most part, the game was fun to play. One downside of the game was the tediousness of having to re-explore areas previously visited once you found a pair of goggles. The concept was nice, but you really had to go back & look at everything again to see if the goggles would give any further clues. The other negative is you can actually complete the game without exploring everything or completing all puzzles. This happened to me (the 1st game I've ever played that did this), I actually went back to playing it to see what I missed. And the ending, I didn't quite get the ending. Still not sure if I do. But it's worth playing if you like creepy games."
1,Poorly developed and planned,"I was very excited to play this game as it seemed somewhat spooky and was reviewed well overall. However, I quickly learned that the plot was very weakly developed. I longed to understand more of the story, but vital information seemed completely abscent.Characters were introduced never to be seen again. There was no logical motivation behind which objects the player can examine or pick up.Additionally, the game was far too short. I completed it in only a few hours of play, and the ending, which I will not disclose here, was abrupt and disappointing."
4,Spooky fun!,"Okay, I'm not easily spooked, but this game managed to do it! I actually loved it! Good medium-difficulty puzzles which were all very logical. I didn't know there were other Lights Out games until I came on to review this one. I am definitely planning on trying the ""The Journal"" now."
4,Reliable no-frills fun,"The game was a good one for those that avoid violent games where fighting is required to get anywhere. This one has just enough ambience to entertain, but not too much to keep you up nights.My system is about four years old now,yet still powerful enough to meet the demands of most games, so this one was no challenge hardware-wise. I've never actually owned an AdventureGames.com game that ever did exceed my system's configurations and requirements listing. That being said, there may be issues for some with the sound & lighting that is always very dim in the game. The graphics/sound may not appear or work at their best if you have integrated sound and video on your computer's motherboard. A separate sound and graphics card would be worth the investment for most."
4,DeLonghi has a good reputation...,"I just purchased this item through Amazon today. A friend of my has a similar digital design but without the remote. The machine is a little noisy, but it's almost like white noise you'd get from a sleep machine. It does put out heat and I like the safey features. It remains cool to the touch and has a nice range of oscillation.The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 was that I think it should have a safety cut off features when (if) the heater gets tipped over. It does have a overheat safety cutoff, but since I have children, the tip over cut off feature would have been nice.It is lightweight and easy to operate too.I'll update my review once I actually receive mine that comes with the remote."
1,"Low-quality fan motor, terrible grating noise","I paid extra for this heater because I wanted the digital thermostat and the remote is handy. I thought DeLonghi would be good quality; boy was I wrong. It's pretty good looking, but the quality is disappointing. In particular, the fan grates and vibrates -- it started out pretty bad, but it's gotten worse and worse. Now it's out of warranty and it's so loud that it's basically unusable.I bought a cheap, $20 ceramic heater which is MUCH quieter."
1,Great While It Lasted,Buyer beware. The heater worked great while it lasted. I had mine for over a year when one day it just stopped working. Couldn't power it on and that was that. DeLonghi wouldn't replace it because of the 1 year warranty.
1,Not reached my expectations,I was excited when I see this product on the web and when I start using this I don't see and any advantage moreover it gives noise and less heat and I stopped using this. I don't suggest this product.
2,Won't heat up your room!,"I purchased this heater based on reviews I read saying this heated up someone's whole apartment and how wonderful it was. I got the heater to try and help keep my living room warm. Even if I have my regular house heat turned up, my living room will remain cold. So I got this heater to help with that. I really liked the heater and how it had a remote. I didn't find the beeping noise that loud - other reviews said it was super loud and annoying. It really wasn't at all. However, the heater didn't do much. It didn't hardly heat up the area at all. You pretty much had to be sitting directly in front of it and really close to feel anything. So it was very disappointing and a major letdown because I was so excited to finally be warm! I think this heater would be great for under someone's desk at work, but beyond that I don't think it has the power to heat up a room...or even part of a room."
3,Glad I bought this!,"I 'live' in a basement which gets pretty cold, my room has one wall that is considered an outside wall, in order to have any light in my room I need to have my bathroom door open - two outside walls. As soon as this arrived I plugged it in my bathroom and the heater recorded my bathroom temperature at 56. I set it to auto and it keeps my bathroom and bedroom nice and toasty! The only downside was it's rather loud and makes a few noises, made it difficult to sleep for a few nights. I'm over it now, and it's wonderful! If you live in a cool area, this is a great- and not too pricey - device to invest in.EDITED:I went to plug the heater in this winter and to my disappointment it wouldn't turn on. Of course the one year warranty is up. While it was a good heater when it worked, I did have to lower my rating on this item; it lasted just a little over a year."
2,Not recommended,"Works great as a heater, but after a couple of weeks it started making un unbearable buzzing noise which forced me to stop using it. I used it in my bedroom during the winter because my room does not have a radiator, and I thought this did an excellent job of heating my room; however, I couldn't sleep with all of the awful noise this started making.Doesn't even look like this is available anymore. Maybe that's why."
2,Noisy.....Mediocre.....Noisy,"I purchased this product to replace a couple of other space heaters that served me well, but are on the way out. I largely picked this unit because of the overall positive ratings and reviews. I received this unit and immediately put it to use. I found the noise very distracting and so have visiting guest. I figured if it heated my living room well, maybe I could live with it. No so my friends, it takes over an hour to raise the temperature one degree. My two older units still more than adequately warm the room working at half power (that is all they have left). Did I mention my living room is only 400 sq. ft.? If you need quiet, do not buy this unit. If you need a heater for your bathroom, this fills the ticket. Otherwise, there are much better choices out there."
4,Oscillation?,This heater oscillates. Can this oscillation feature be turned off so the heater just points in a single direction? Thanks in advance.
2,Is that all ya got?,"Purchased this as I'm always cold, but do not want to heat up whole house to meet my warmth requirements. If I stood RIGHT in front of it, I was ok.I am really not sure how others are so happy about the output from this. It draws a LOT of power (tripped a breaker and had to find a different circuit to put it on) and did not heat up my 12x18 room more than a couple degrees after having it on all day.It is now the 1/2 bath heater and does ""ok"" in there (a 4x5' room) but still won't heat it up above 61. Spend a little more & get a radiant heater - while you have to leave it on nearly all the time, much better warming capability for less power."
1,Disappointed With The Delivered Order,"Very disappointed with the delivered heater. I ordered a new heater, but I received an open and used heater. The heater box is damaged, slight scraches and dirt on the heater. I'll be contacting Amazon or the seller and find out how to replace the used heater."
5,FANTASTIC HEATER!,"I purchased one of these for my office and loved how quiet it was, so I moved it into the bedroom at night. When I moved my office to the basement, I realized I needed a little head (that oscillated) for my feet) and this immediately came to mind! The remote is GREAT and mades it really easy to us! It heats up quickly, but does not overheat. It also has a great sensory component in that it turns off if something is too close to front of it or to the back of it in order to prevent fire hazards. The motor can get a little louder at times, but I don't realize it. I can get my work done just fine1 I highly recommend this heater to anyone looking for a quick fix! THe temperature gauge with backlit system on the top is also really nice!"
3,It's Ok.,"It works. It isn't as quiet as I'd like, but it does its job. I don't care for the fact there's no off button present on the unit as there is on the remote (you have to hold the mode button down for a few seconds to get it to turn off). Nor do I care for the fact that it forgets all it's settings once it is turned off so you have to set the temp every time you turn it on. It makes me long for my old fashioned device that just had a knob you could turn to set a temp and another knob for off/low/high."
3,Nice but Loud,"I love the remote. It means I go to bed warm, turn it down when I'm in and can turn it up again when I wake up. I never have to be cold again. Unfortunately the unit is VERY noisy. The other reviews said it was noisy, but it really is. It works well for my 10x10 room, but I wouldn't try it in a much bigger room. Overall, it is a good one room unit with neat features."
3,Noisy,"It's a good heater. warm up the whole room pretty fast, while the noise made is really unbearable. At the first night I used it, I was waken up by the noise twice...horrible sound. I am looking for some oil-filled heater to enjoy my sleep again."
4,Works well,"Satisfied overall. Heats space quickly. Love the remote control. Somewhat annoying that power button is also the control for oscillation. If unit is running and you press power but don't hold it down long enough, the unit starts oscillating instead of shutting off. Nice that you can set it to a specific temperature. When temperature has been reached, heating element and fan both shut off and then turn on again when temperature drops."
2,Disappointed in length of use ...,I purchased this 3 years ago along with the MICA panel. I still actively use the MICA panel it is used nightly (year round) to heat my son's room. This lasted one season and then broke. I then purchased the 4590ER and that lasted one season and broke. Meanwhile I purchased a 2nd MICA panel and LOVE IT. They both are wonderful but now are no longer offered from amazon.com. But back to this product review ... it worked. It was a tad bit loud and I felt like I had Kitt from Knight Rider in my room (especially with it going back and forth) but other than that it did it's job. Just not the quality I would have expected.
3,"Great heater, not so great on the electric bill!","This is a powerful, safe little heater, it heats up my 100sq ft office in my basement nicely, however, it has caused my electric bill to increase by $75 a month. So I can't say it is really greatly economical."
5,good product,"I like this little heater!It's powerful enough to heat up my 12X10 bedroom in few minutes. It's much faster than the original heater(embedded in the wall).With the remote you can set the timer, set the temperature...nice~"
5,Great Pan...Great Price,You will have hard time beating the quality of construction and durability of this pan. Certainly the best for the price.
2,Major dislike of Calphalon,I see from Amazon's product alert that my Calphalon was bought in 03. Well I am looking for replacements for them all. I do not own a dishwasher. Handwashing is done. I use a gas stove and oven. I bought this cookware because of the reviews. I'm sorry I did because I dislike it intensely. Here is why. It is very very heavy. It is instantly discolored and food sticks. It has been treated gently and according to manufacturers directions but it does not ever come clean again! Outside/inside...all discolored and nothing recomended has worked. Calpholon...take it away!!!
5,Good stuff,"For those who still remember how to cook... you don't need non stick cookware... the hard anodized cookware was some of the best stuff back in the olden days and still is :)It heats up fast and holds the heat well, yet still responds quickly to flame temp change."
5,I love all Calphalon!,"This is a great saucepan. Even though it is not considered to be a ""nonstick"" pan, I cooked macaroni & cheese last night and it worked perfectly. The shallow sides allow for more cooking surface and I can see alot of future uses with this one! Buy it - it's more than worth every penny!"
2,only after one use,"I must have received a defective saucepan because after only one use (to heat tomato sauce, using a wooden spoon to stir and a gentle sponge to clean), the bottom surface of the pan was horribly distorted. It was smooth to the touch, but looked as if I had been using and abusing this pan for years. I returned it promptly and Amazon gave me a full refund immediately (so amazon, as usual, was pretty great in responding to defective issues) but I was disappointed with my experience. Must admit I am a little scared to try another item from this line, fearing that the quality has to do with these being manufactured in China, which apparently is a fairly recent change. In terms of weight and heat conduction, it matched my expectations, so I am giving it two stars."
5,Great product,Product was delivered in timely fashion. I used it right away to make a number of items and it seems to be standing up well to my abuse.
4,Calphalon Warrantee,"Commercial Calphalon products such as this one should last forever and carry a lifetime guarantee. If you cookware has lost it coating of you find your cookware is not performing contact Calphalon , they have a web page, and see the warrantee information. They will either repair or replace the item. The only downside is the YOU have to pay to ship it."
4,Good pan,"In all honesty,we probably wouldn't have bought this pan exceptfor the price. It has turned out to be one that we use for almost every meal! Since most of the time there are only the two of us,the size is perfect. The heavy weight of this pan keeps things from burning. I highly recommend it. I paid 29.99 for mine and thought that was good."
4,This heavy-duty saucepan is a great value!,"This product provides a high-quality, heavy-duty saucepan at a great value. The short, shallow style of the pan is perfect for making sauces or browning onions/meats. The extremely thick construction of the pan makes me feel positive that it will never warp or crack: it looks as good now as when I first bought it two years ago, and I am confident that this is a product which I will own for a lifetime. I have only two minor complaints about this saucepan: 1) the metal handle gets quite hot, and its narrow design makes it a bit difficult to grip, especially with a pot holder, and 2) it is not non-stick, although it generally cleans up well using a plastic scrubber. Despite these issues, I would definitely recommend this saucepan for the serious cook as well as anyone else looking for a high performance, quality cookware product."
4,Hello in Mass. These pans are not supposed to be nonstick!,"To the kitchen & housewares enthusiast from Massachusetts--this line of Calphalon pots and pans never claim to be nonstick. They're heavy duty commercial pots and pans. Before you diss a product, read up on it ! That way your next purchase won't be so disappointing."
3,Worth the sale price,"This is one of the Chinese made pots and it's not up to the Calphalon standard. The surface preparation of the interior is rougher than a US made pan, so much so that you can feel it when cleaning. That having been said it's still a decent pot and well worth the $30 sale price."
2,didnt last the test of time.,"I bought this pan in 2005. Recently, I noticed small pits in the bottom. I am wondering where the missing pieces have gone!! I will be calling a Caphalon representative to find out why this pan is pitted. I have several other pans that don't have this problem. In the future, I will buy the copper pans instead. I have several of them and I love them. All of these pans must be hot before you put oil or butter in them or your food will stick. It takes some practice, but you will love them if you take the time."
2,someone,"I love Calphalon products, so there was no way I could turn this one down. I almost never use this pot. Everything sticks to it. The only thing I use it for is heating up canned soup, and even that sticks."
5,awesome,"I bought this for my friend Patti. She is still cooking away (and well, I might add) on this beauty.Well worth the money. I hope to have one for myself one day."
3,"""Made in China"" makes me wonder if it's AUTHENTIC . . .","I purchased a set of CALPHALON COMMERCIAL pots/pans for a GREAT price, but when they arrived, I was somewhat disappointed to discover that they were MADE IN CHINA - I have another set which I purchased at COSTCO (which were made in the USA), so I compared the two, and I'm wondering if ""you get what you pay for"" applies here - Only time will tell if my second set of pots holds up . . ."
5,Great product,"I love all my calphalon pots, pans, and bakeware. Best set I have every owned or used. Even heat, easy clean up, I have never made reductions as easily as I have in these pots & pans.The fact that you can get these on special with great pricing puts it over the top. I paid $24.99 for this when I bought a few other pieces. Got free shipping & $25.00 off the order."
5,Go for it!,"Extremely useful shape and size, and quality is impeccable. A steal at this price. Be sure to scrub it very well every time you clean it, and you won't have any problems down the road. Soaking is your friend. A serious tool for serious cooks."
5,a Classic Pan,"Looking at my old Amazon records I see that I bought this pan over 4 years ago for $19.99. What were Amazon thinking ? It was a steal (well, actually it was a special offer). At first I was a little unsure about the pan since it had relatively low sides. Now I appreciate it as one of my best. It's normally one of the first pans out when I'm cooking and works particularly well for cooking rice.It still works as well as when I first bought it, although the base got a little warped when I once put it on to heat without any water in.Sadly I see that there are 443 reviews already for this item, so I guess this one is going to remain forever unloved on page 45 of 45..."
3,Everything sticks!,"This is a great saucepan (perfect size), but everything - I mean EVERYTHING - sticks to it and it's difficult to clean."
4,Don't burn the macaroni,"I purchased this pot in January, and have used it several times a week since. I love the pot for sauces and other stove top applications, it has worked tremedously on my ceramic stove top (grrr hate the ceramic wish it was gas but that is a different review). The pot has been easy to clean and the finish has held up very well, and I looked forward to years of use until I boiled the pot dry with my macaroni noodles. The noodles seemed to have bonded in a blackened brotherhood to the bottom of the pot and no amount of soaking, scrubbing, cleaning can seem to coax them to separate again. Because this little incident had more to do with being the mother of a teething 8 month old and had very little to do with the pot, I will definatly be purchasing another pot.Overall this is a great purchase at an unbelievable price, so for cooks hoping to take their dishes up a notch I would totally reccomend it just don't leave it on the stove with noodles and no water for over 30 minutes."
5,A great saucepan,"I recently ordered this based on my appreciation for Calphalon products and the great price. This is a fantastic saucepan that can practically double as a saute pan. It is surprisingly large and roomy, and the extra diameter gives it plenty of room for fitting in two or three chicken breasts, a modest steak, or a handful of veggies. I love it for making coq au vin since it isn't too large and goes right in the oven.Nothing sticks to this pan if you add just a dab of butter or oil, and it heats up and cools quickly. One great feature of pure aluminum cookware is the fact that aluminum dissipates heat quickly, so pulling the pan off the heat is a great way to regulate the temperature when making a sauce. This is a great product and a wonderful addition to my Calphalon cookware collection."
4,Excellent every day product!!!,"This line of pots and pans are simply great for every day use. They are a good combination of sturdiness, quick-even heating and easy to clean. There are no phenolic handles or knobs to crack or pop off after a few years of use. Excellent cooking characteristics!!!"
4,"Handy size, heats quickly, holds heat evenly","This pot is a handy size, it heats up quickly, and holds the heat evenly."
5,Excellent Value!,I bought two and gave them for presents at Christmas. They are a excellent value and a much appreciated gift!
4,Great product for even better price,My wife turned me one to Calpalon a few years ago and have yet to have to replace them. I could not believe the price and decided to add an additional pot because we never seem to have enough. If you are looking for a good heavy duty pot this is the one for you.
5,Get two!!!,"I wasn't sure I would like such a shallow saucepan...it's only about 2"" deep, but after using it a few times, I found myself reaching for it more and more often....I use it for everything from sauteing green beans with garlic, to browning ground beef for tacos and making puddings.Hands down, this is one of the most versatile sizes of pans out there. It is so handy, that I added a second one to my 9 pc set, as well as to each of my daughters' sets.Watch for the prices to drop as they do tend to fluctuate quite a bit, and then grab yourself an extra one or two...you'll be glad you did."
5,love it!!,"Had this for two years. Pelasure to cook with and clean. Love hard anodized. Dishwasher safe and may use an abrasive cleaner. Drawbacks: size is rather small (although in my 3 people household it gets lots of use), gets scratched really easily (I need to stack the pots in the closet and this gets really scratched up and reay quickly)"
4,Calphalon Saucepan top quality,"Great price for a quality pan. Medium to heavy weight pan great for rice, sauce and other items. Lid fits securely and clean up is easy even with burnt rice. Similar pans sell for almost $100.00"
5,wow,"This is a well built pan. It has a feeling of being so solid that I imagine it will last the rest of my lifetime. The sides and bottom of the pan are around 1/4"", which is thicker than any other pan I've ever owned."
2,Good and Heavy but Anodizing wears off,"These pans are great with regards to being heavy. Few aluminum cookwear comes close to this. But in my use, all no longer have acceptable Anodizing on the bottom. I believe cooking tomato sauses etc (acidics) eats away the coating. For this, I rate these very low and recommend other coatings."
3,Works all right but NOT non-stick,"In general, the construction of this saucepan is great and it's definitely worth the money. However, it is NOT a non-stick pan. Rather, as advertised, it is ""stick-resistant"" so things will stick if you don't properly cook with it. Eggs and various flour products (dumplings for instance) are especially tricky to work with and will definitely not come off the bottom of the pan.If you are cooking with this pan I would recommend not cooking eggs, fish, or any starchy foods. Otherwise the pan works great."
5,Excellent buy - great pan,I've read a number of complaints about food sticking and difficulty with cleaning. We've experienced neither of these - make sure the heat is not too high and clean with hot water! It's a great saucepan and the price was great. Highly recommended!
4,Great size...nice quality...nice looking!,"Wonderful pan! Great cooking surface! Quality all the way!I come from a background of restaurant ownership and for one reason or another have sidestepped purchasing any Calphalon cookware. WOW! I had no idea what I'd been missing!I recently purchased this and three pieces in the pro line of Calphalon. I gave this a four start rating because I appreciate the weight and durability of the Pro line the best...more utilitarian in it's design approach. The Commercial line seems to be geared for those who appreciate a prettier pot to cook from or hang.If you like a bit dressier Calphalon Pan then go with the Commercial line. You won't be disappointed! Great purchase price..and you can't beat Amazon.com's quick, wonderful and dependable service!Linda"
2,The coating is not good at ALL,"After I read the reviews here, I brought one a month ago from Amazon.As my habit to prepare cooking ware, I boiled water with 80% full & water+ 1 T of cooking oil for about an hour each time trying to get ride most of chemical residual.The 1st time I used the pot for cooking, the food stick on the bottom of the pot! I was so SURPRISED to see such a nice pot with this low quality! Disappointed!"
4,My Calphalon Saucepan,"I have found many uses for my saucepan. I use it to steam my vegetables, I use it for rice, I use it cook my brocolli and mushroom chicken breasts. These are meals for two with leftovers. I love using my saucepan in so many different ways.Thelma"
5,perfect for large and small kitchens,"It's sturdy, the right size and oh so cute! Whether your cooking for one or a family, this little saucer will fit nicely into your collection. It has nice high sides so the sauce won't splash out as easily and a well fitting lid. It's heavy but that only means that it will last a long time and cook your food evenly.Enjoy!"
1,I might've as well bought a cast iron saucepan,"Bought this a couple of months back and the bottom of the pan already seems to have lost the coating and looks like an iron skillet used for years.I expected better with the reputation of calphalon and after reading all the rave reviews here.As a note, i always used the saucepan under medium heat and washed it carefully.Disappointing..."
4,$24.99 and heats up very quickly,I haven't used this to cook down a sauce yet. This heats up much quicker than a stainless steel saucepan and water dries very quickly so good for fast hard boiled eggs.
4,Great buy,This is a great pan but you have to remember to use more oil so that the food doesn't stick to it. Clean up is not very easy.
4,Pretty good so far,"I've only had the pan a short while, and only used it a few time. But it has done pretty well so for. It heats evenly and the shallow design is nice. I've seen people complain about the finish and so far mine has help up just fine. Handwash only."
4,Nice for the price,Very durable and I really think it will last me a lifetime. Versus the cheaper products.
4,So far so good!,"It's on the heavy side for me, I'm a small person. But, it cooks evenly, and is big enough to cook soupy items in my kitchen. Handle can get slightly heated closer to the pan, but I've never needed to use a potholder so far. Same goes for the lid, and it's not glass so I'm not worried about breaking it. I had a pot with a glass lid and I couldn't see in anyway, since all you see is steam and condensation.As always, I wish it was slightly more affordable, but it's still a good buy and it's very useful."
3,Disappointed,"I was looking forward to the saucepan being as well crafted as one I bought several years ago. Indeed, the original ones were the best. I have several with beautiful handles, some with no stick and annodized. They are no longer available. I thought that the ones I just ordered were from the originals no longer made.I bought 2 saucepans. One for me and one as a gift. The metal handle and bolts look cheap on the ones I ordered.I looked and it is now made in China. The original ones were made in Toledo Ohio. I gave one as a gift and had told the receiver that this is one of the original ones and is high quality, before I opened mine. I aplologized to them for my mistake.I heated some food in it and it seems to cook alright. I haven't really given it a real workout yet. I know that I will not be buying the products of Calphalon any longer. They are not the same quality."
5,A 'Do-Everything' Saucepan,"Just recently I discovered Calphalon. What a find! I use this shallow saucepan for everything -- homemade soups, sauces, you name it. Everything cooks evenly; no hot spots or burned food to contend with. When I'm finished with the pan, it gets a quick wipedown with a soapy sponge and it's back in service. As many other reviewers have stated, it's best when preheated. I've tossed cold veggies in and not had a sticking problem as some others have noted. This is fast becoming my favorite pan."
1,Trash-everything sticks,"I bought the small stainless frypan at the Chef's Outlet in Birch Run, MI. The warranty is VERY restrictive and everything seems to stick to the pan for me. I called the company and they said the food should be room temperature. MORE RESTRICTIONS. I have given it several tries with no success. Fried potatoes, onions, eggs and it ALL sticks. I don't know why I bought this....had some extra cash. Because I like my iron skillet. Not as temperamental and easier to clean. The only way you can return this item is if the rivets come off, but I think they will not give you money back. Buy it closer to home so you can return it if you don't like it. I am 100 mi away. I see some great reviews, though. I wonder if they had stainless and if they fried?????"
3,These pots are hard to clean,"I have been using my new stainless calphalon cookware for about 6 weeks. I have to say, it is nice to cook with once I realized that it takes less heat than what I was using. But the pots are hard to clean. Dishwashing liquid does not do the job, the pots still look uncleaned after brushing and/or sponging with Dawn. Next step was gentle work with Brillo. Better but not perfectly clean. Clean enough, tho....so I put 'em away not exactly clean; I'm unwilling to spend any more time to reach cleaning perfection on my pots 'n pans! There's a white film on the surface....salt? Who knows. Very hard to remove! These are brand new, expensive ""serious"" pots and pans and I am not happy to have this cleaning issue rear its ugly head."
1,So disappointed...,I was trying to buy a good quality saucepan that's why I chose Calphalon but the quality of this one is REALLY BAD!!! I thought it's a non-stick saucepan but the pan makes everything sticks to its bottom!!! I will never recommend this product to anyone.
2,Good but very Heavy,"Hi,I bought this one two weeks before. It looks cute but difficult to handle. because it is very heavy and if you use it making curries you need be careful because it sticks at bottom. Since it has Iron handle you need to use Hand glove to move out of heater."
4,Almost perfect,"I have purchased this as a gift for someone. At this low price, I will really impress her without spending too much at all! My only complaint is with the packaging. It comes in a plain white box with no picture of the item or any indication it's from Calphalon. There is only a small sticker that says, ""Made in China"".Can't comment on its use - I haven't used it!"
3,sturdy and heavy,"This is a great pot, bought for 1o dollars, probably not worth 2o they have been selling"
1,tem Not describes truthfully,"The seller misrepresented the item online, item was not usable should have been thrown away."
2,For boiling not frying,"I love the weight, and that I can use regular utensils. Be aware, you can not fry in any of the cookware without it sticking. I wanted an omlet and thought I would use extra oil to be able to flip it--no way. I literally poached my eggs in oil and it still stuck. I like the stock pot fine, but would not purchase the set again."
4,Very Happy so Far,I bought this pan solo as I am trying to figure out what to register for after a recent engagement. I am really happy with the design. It seems very sturdy and the handle stays cool to the touch.
2,Buy American,"We do not have this pan but have quite a few Calphalon pans. The Chinese ones are thinner and the anodize tends to scratch off. The American made ones, however, hold up like iron. I always check the nation of origin with these and avoid those made in China."
3,'Commercial' grade??? Pardon my laughter (Chinese cheapo).,"If this is 'commercial', I fear for the future of this company. (Actually, Calphalon states that commercial use will void the warranty.) The base is relatively heavy; however, the lid is very light weight and bounces atop the pan while boiling. My read is that it was certainly worth the low Amazon price, but the 'list' price quoted is a ridiculous exageration.I do use this pan quite a bit for veggies. Its silky smooth interior makes cleanup a breeze."
1,Chucked it.,"It's not nonstick and it's not easy to clean. I own the regular steel pans and one nonstick pan, all by Calphalon. I don't understand the point of hard-anodized. This pan shouldn't cost more than twenty dollars for people who are looking for this type of pan. It's sturdy and durable but to me USELESS so I wouldn't pay a dime for it."
5,Great cookware,This Calphalon Saucepan is an added piece to my collection of the hard-anodized line I currently have. I recommend this cookware to anyone who demands quality and great looks as well as ease of use.
2,"Not easy to clean. not very non-stick, too hot handles.","I'm disappointed in the whole line of Calphalon products.1) They are much more difficult to clean as other non-stick products I've used. Even traditional stainless-steel is easier to clean because you can throw Brillo at it.2) The handles on them get very hot, and aren't really useful because of that.3) food sticks to them much more than it does on cheap department store non-stick cookware.They are good at being heavy... foods do cook evenly.My recommendation is to skip this and track down the Pampered Chef professional line, (not sure what the price comparison is, but they are much better) or get cheaper non-stick no-brand stuff that will be easier to clean and that food won't stick to."
2,Note: It is NOT NON-Stick!,Read the description very carefully...It is not non-stick...Some products ARE and some ARE NOT...Surprised to find out the hard way.
3,Made for Less Quality and More Profit,"I purchased the Simply Calphalon Nonstick Hard-Anodized Aluminum 2-Quart Saucepan with Cover a couple of months ago. That one was made in Toledo, Ohio. I paid two whole dollars more for that one, here at Amazon. I can't really say if it is the fact that that one is of the Simply Calphalon series that made it better or that it wasn't made in China. I will tell you that this one just doesn't compare. Go with Simply Calphalon and try to stay away from the Chinese produced Calphalon products. I'd been sooo happy with my other Calphalon purchases here at Amazon. I was severely dissapointed with this one. Made In China is really turning into Made for Less Quality and More Profit."
2,Calphalon One no where near the original Calphalon,"I have owned the original Calphalon Professional Hard Anodized for near 10 years. It is really good cookware. I recently bought a new piece but had to get the Calphalon One series since the original series has been obsoleted. Well, the One series is much thinner, my stock pot warped during the first few uses. Also, the finish is not as thick it does not wear near as well either. You may counter my claim with the lifetime warranty, but who wants to send your cookware away for 2 months? People who pay this much for cookware don't like TV dinners!"
2,Wish I had not spent the money,"I had read about the hard anodized aluminum pans and thought I would like them. They are expensive and since I just needed a medium sized saucepan, I thought this was a good way to try it out and at a bargain price.I really don't like this pan. I read the instructions about cooking at medium or lower heat and lightly greasing before cooking, and read what other reviewers had to say. I wish I had listened to what the 3,2,and 1 star reviewers had said.I have used this pan three times since purchasing it and food sticks to it EVERY time I use it. Fortunately it is easy to clean by just soaking it in hot soapy water and using a plastic scrubber.The only thing I can say positive is that the pan heats up quickly and distributes and holds heat well."
2,Not make for Stir-fry,"I saw the rating review, and thought I couldn't go wrong with $30 for a saucepan. I had it 2 weeks, and tried boiling chicken and stirfry cut chicken vegetables, and it sticks. Both times I used it; I had to scrape the bottom of the pan. I don't really like to return item, but this really bothers me. My expectation maybe too high. I want a saucepan that can be versatile and good for high and low heat."
4,Sturdy Pot,"For 30 dollars I am very pleased with this purchase. As have been mentioned, it is a little low in height, but its volume is it's volume and it can be deceptive. But the quality of the pot is wonderful. It's heavy, and it's aluminum which Alton Brown tells me is not as good as copper but better than stainless steel. After a couple days of cooking with it I've found it really absorbs heat and seems to get hotter and maintain heat better than either of my other pots. The riveting is strong, and handle is all metal allowing it go into the oven or under the broiler at 500f."
3,"Great saucepan, as long as you don't cook acidic foods in it","This is a fantastic saucepan - best I've ever used for making risotto. However, it does have an Achilles heel that everyone should be aware of - the anodized interior does not stand up well long-term to cooking acidic foods, such as tomato sauces or vinegar based braises. After less than a year of (admittedly heavy) use, the anodization on the interior has started to wear through. In fairness to Calphalon, this is an inherent limitation of all cookware with anodized aluminum interiors - I just wish I had known this before using it. With the lifetime warranty I'll be getting a new one soon, and this time I'll be more cautious about what I cook in it."
4,Calphalon Cookware,This is a very versatile piece of cookware. It is wonderfully heavy and conducts heat well. It is praticularly well suited for sauces and a wisk can be used in this pot. It is not as easy to clean as the non-stick surface cookware. Metal utensils can be used without damaging the surface.
3,Is this really Calphalon?,"I have other Calphalon items in this series. This item doesn't match their quality. The handle is not polished, but rough, as tho I wasn't finished properly. The pan itself seems okay."
2,Own this and a whole set of these,I own this pan along with a huge set of this cookware. I like the way these pans and pots simmer but they stick like mad no matter what anyone here says. I also got as a free gift with purchase one of their stainless steel pans and it is a dream compared to these. They are not really making and selling these pots anymore out in stores. Its either the stainless steel or the nonstick insides with the anodized outsides. If I could return all the pans I purchased and exchange them for the stainless ones I would do it in a heartbeat. If you are just going to use these for simmering and boiling pasta and such they are ok but anything that needs browning or pan frying or the like including frying an egg will be hard to do in any of these pans.
5,Calphalon commercial Saucepan,"Professional high quality to last a lifetime. Great to cook in, I'd highly recommend this saucepan its a convenient size, food cooks evenly, cleans easily, no residue, and it was a great deal, only $20, regular list price around $180..."
3,Great Price,"Loved the price, pan is wonderful but the black coating is starting to scratch off in the center. Just a little disappointed."
3,Good,"I've been adding to my Calphalon collection, I prefer the glass lids, but this was such a great price, I couldn't resist. The pot washes up nicely and cooks evenly."
5,"Quite simply, the best pan I've ever owned!","I've owned a lot of pans over my lifetime, but nothing comes close to this! If only I had started out with Caphalon, I wouldn't have wasted my money on all those other pans! Honestly, don't let the fact that it's not non-stick scare you; it cleans up easily and is a dream. I'm actually back to buy my 2nd piece of Calphalon; the price here at Amazon is fantastic! Buy it, you won't regret it."
3,Good stuff,Very good material. Nothing negative can be said about this. Its a little heavy but I suppose that comes with the territory. Very easy to clean and wash up. Have had it for about a couple of years now and works perfectly well. Good stuff indeed.
4,"Great pan, though not completely non-stick.","Love this pan, most foods do not stick, its easy to clean.Starchy foods such as rice may stick a little."
2,Price is good but this pan is not that good,"I agree with the previous reviewer. I love calphalon but this pan is not good. Not only food sticks to it, the color of the inside bottom of the pan changes after the first time use. So it is kind of scary."
2,This one didn't do it for me!,"I love calphalon products, so it was a no brainer to order this. I was disappointed. I find it one of my most troublesome pans to clean. I do not have that problem with anything else I've ever bought that is caphalon, but this tends to simply gather dust until I have no choice to use it."
2,Nice saucepan but not US made,"I purchased a Calphalon Unison Slide saucepan elsewhere that I love and use every day for oatmeal, rice, etc. When I saw this saucepan online and the great Amazon price, I did not hesitate to order. Unfortunately, when it arrived I discovered that, unlike my beloved pot, it was made in China not the US. So, with regret, I returned it. I found and bought a similar pan for twice the price made in Spokane, Washington."
3,When the biggest draw to a book is the author's name...,"I read this book while taking a class on children's literature, and was asked to look at the lieterary elements in the story. I have found this book to be boring for a child, as the talking dolls in the story reveal the moral explicitly. The girl does not come to moral understanding through experience, which is the best way to present a moral to a young reader. The idea of this book is solid, but it's presentation is definately lacking. Good characters, even in children's books, stay with you for quite a while. I read this story yesterday, and hardly remember anyone or anything."
4,A story of cheer and insight,"On her way home from Sunday school, a young African-American girl is put ""in a tizzy"" because her slow-poke brother likes to let his eyes wander to the beautiful world surrounding them. On returning to her home, her toys --which speak to a child as toys should--also make her a bit distressed by their habits of indecisiveness, laziness, and constant curiosity. It is Dear Dolly who questions the young girl as to why she goes to Sunday school when she doesn't believe in anything taught there. In objecting, our young protagonist reflects upon advice from the elder doll who reminds her that God is constantly within us and challenges us. God is in everyone and it is God who makes us who we are. In ""letting go and letting God,"" the young girl begins to stop worrying about everyone else and rejoices in the God incarnate in each of us.This is a simple and nice story with some serious ideas to ponder. The book's watercolor illustrations are wonderful."
5,Greatful dead,"Book was listed as used, it was in great shape could of sold as new and I would not of questionedGreat purchase"
4,"easy to use, well-designed toaster oven","We had this toaster for 4 years: easy to use, did a nice job on toasting, baking, and broiling, nice and compact so it doesn't eat up the whole counter. Disappointing when the lower heater element failed & I found out that it's necessary to ship the toaster somewhere just to get that part replaced. The Panasonic web site is completely messed up so I never could figure out how to do that, so I gave up and bought a new Sanyo toaster oven instead."
5,Great toaster oven!,"Actually, this is the second Panasonic Toaster oven that I have purchased. I was so pleased with the first one, I bought one for my daughter. It is the best toaster oven that I have ever used. It's great on bread or bagels, but it will also re-heat just about anything. It has several individual buttons for specific jobs. And, it is easy to clean. What's not to like?"
3,Somewhat disappointed,"This infrared oven has underperformed my $30 toaster oven. We tried to cook salmon in it, and it took 2+ hours (and salmon was still not cooked). I found out that it basically cannot cook anything wrapped in aluminum foil (even though we were following the exact directions from the manual). In terms of toasting and reheating frozen pizza, it does work faster than a toaster oven, just don't expect to do any real cooking (such as pork chops, salmon fillet etc)."
5,The Perfect Toaster,"This is the toaster for me. When I bought this unit I was not sure that it was going to work as discribed. After using the NB-G100P it's like going from dial up to broadband, you will never go back. It turned out to be the best toaster I have ever owned. Good Job Panisonic. Perfect Toast, Waffles, Pizza and anything else that could use a little toasting."
5,Where can I find this oven now?,I've had one for two years now and I love it! Best toaster oven hands down I've ever owned. I'm trying to buy one as a gift and can't find them anywhere!?! Why are they no longer available and can anyone help me to locate this product or something similar?
3,Just OK!,"As one of the previous reviewers stated it is OK, but nothing near as exceptional as the other reviewers stated. Honestly, I don't think it toasts all that good. You never know how the toast is going to come out sometimes well done sometimes not toasted at all, and this is on the same setting. Which is annoying when you have people in your household who are particular about crunchiness. I'm waiting for it to breakdown so I can justify purchasing a different toaster.Also, I got this for about $40 or $50, when they had a rebate going, I think $99 is way overpriced for this toater oven.Also, it does not look good on the counter it is kind of junky looking. I have bought a nice Krups convection toater oven since and am happy with it's performance and it's much more attractive on the counter."
2,I was looking for more...,"I can not testify as to how well this unit makes toast. I basically bought this Toaster oven for it oven capabilities.* I like the fact that the oven cuts off after the timer expires. Things burn quicker in a toaster oven.* My major gripe: I often can not selected the correct oven temperature. For example, today I needed to warm up some bread sticks to go with Italian dish. The box told me to set the temperature to 375 degress. Guess what, there is no 375 degree temperature on this unit. There is a 355 and 390. Other frequently requested temperature settings missing on this unit are 350, 400, 450. 425 is the only relatively common temperature setting that is found on this Toaster Oven.As a ""don't fire up the big oven heating up the house on a hot summer day"" unit, this toaster oven comes up a little short."
4,not great,"small tray, tray has ridges, so we can't roast potatoes. Toasting is very fast, but uneven and superficial."
5,Great little oven!,"This little oven does eveything I needed it for. I purchased it to replace a Delonghi oven that bellied up after one week and when I called their service center was told there was no service available for my state (scratched that brand permanitley from my shopping) so took it back to the store and ordered out the Panosonic here on Amazon. I really like the cube style shape as it takes up less space on the counter. Makes perfect toast, also works great on the giant pretzells from the club stores, just use the frozen toast setting and they come out wonderful. I've used it for everything from the small pizzas to breaded cod and am very happy with the purchase."
4,"Convienient, fast and easy cooking",After always buying the cheapest taosteroven I could find I decided to actually look for a good one for a change. No more preheat waiting. A bit smaller than a lot of the other large convection ovens but stilll large enough for a samll pizza. Easy pull out tray for cleaning too. And when this oven is on the light brightens the whole room...crazy. I have found it cooks very evenly as well. I am very pleased with its performance. Only this that's a little odd is the timer is strange how it displays minutes cooking...it shows a large 5 that is the decimal ofthe actually minutes cooking (eg. 2.5 (5 is large and 2 is very small))
5,Remarkable Toaster,"Panasonic NB-G100P-S 7.2-Quart Flash Express 1300 Watt Infrared Toaster Oven, SilverA real improvement in how a counter toaster should work. It is like upgrading from a 1950's car to a 2007 model. I like it so much I have now purchased 3 more for my friends as gifts. Unfortunately the price keeps going up due to it's popularity. I bought my first one on Amazon for $78.00 including shipping and received it the next day. Can't do that anymore.Barry L. Stern"
4,Good for the price..,"I am surprised on how well this works because of the low price and the fact that it's the only Panasonic product I've had in the last 7 years that hasn't broken. It has a quirky operation that you have to get used to and it may not be the easiest thing to clean, but no complaints on it's performace. I would buy it again."
4,Awesome toaster oven,I've been looking for an oven that didn't have to pre-heat and came across this one. After reading the reviews I ordered this and haven't been disappointed. It heats frozen pizzas and pizza breads in almost half the time of a regular oven. The first time I used it to heat a frozen pizza bread I burned it even though I thought I had set the timer less than the instructions said to. Toast comes out in about 2 min. and I even cooked some cookies to see the results. It actually did a decent job even though I could only get 6 cookies in at one time. I liked this oven so much I got my mom one for Christmas. I gave it only 4 stars due to the physical appearance even though I could care less about the looks as long as it performs to my expectations.
4,The best toaster I have ever owned.,This unit has performed above my expectations with every food item I have prepared with it. I only gave 4 stars because I agree with a previous reviewer that it is not the most attractive appliance in my kitchen.
3,Why is the price rising?,"I don't understand why Amazon keeps raising its price while its sales rank is clearly going down. They had it for $60, then raised it to $80, and today it's $90? C'mon, man, what kind of strategy is that? I like to do business with Amazon, but I don't like this price, so I will go somewhere else."
4,Blink Your Eyes,"This is a wonderful and fascinating book. I live just a few miles away from the real 'Arcata Springs' and 'Fateville', and have visited the 'Halfmoon' dozens of times. I have even met the author at the 'Halfmoon' before. I urge you to read this book."
3,In Love With Her Boss,"Undistracted by love, brawny construction boss Brad Phillips had worked his way up from street kid to millionaire. Of course, Rachel Wood, his invaluable assistant, had believed in - and secretly loved - Brad from the beginning. But after eight years of a strictly professional relationship, Rachel dared not dream of more.So why, when she requested a leave of absence, believing herself in danger in Dallas, did Brad insist on whisking her to safety - in his home, in his arms, as his ""convenient"" wife? Had Rachel's near disappearance - after nearly a decade - stunned Brad into seeing her as a woman...into believing in love?"
4,"I revel reading this practical, wonderfully illustrated book","This is a great guide for beginning to learn grounding, that is, connecting body and soul to earth energy. Illustrations are practical and fun and provide a direction in experiencing these wonderful methods. I recommend this for all personal self-care libraries!"
1,VERY slim volume!,I was disappointed to see how few pages this book had and how much of each page was filled with illustration instead of instruction. NOT worth nine dollars!
3,Untitled,"I enjoyed The Little Grounding Book, not because of its contents, which are very basic, but for its style, which made it easy to understand and easier to implement. Judith Poole gives us a lodestone from which to measure our life progress and goals, and a start-up for people who have just begun their spiritual journey. I would recommend this book to anyone whose spirituality is newfound and to anyone who needs just a little tune-up."
5,Excellent knife set,"I own the Henckels Four Star 7-Piece set. It is everything a cook could wish for unless you need a dedicated boning knife and a longer bread knife. I use the serated blade for slicing tomatoes and eggs, the shears for opening packages and trimming fat from chicken, and the longer blades for chopping and dicing. The paring knife is for removing the eyes from potatoes and peeling apples and the like. I can't remember how I got along in the kitchen without the 8"" knife. It is the one I use the most. I absolutely love this set. My husband gave it to me, and it is one of the best gifts I've ever received. I didn't know how to use the sharpening steel, but I've learned, and I have kept my set sharpened like new. I use the steel on some other good quality knives I own, and I intend to purchase steak knives of the Four Star grade. I never put them in the dishwasher, always use a wood cutting board, and I use them every day. No negatives whatsoever."
4,Excellent knife set,"This is a great knife set. The knives are high quality and well balanced. The utility knife is great. After using this set for almost two years, I only have two complaints. The paring knife is a little small to cover all potential uses. Another 1/2 inch and it would be perfect. Also, the bread knife is almost useless. In addition to the fact it is the least used knife in the set, it is too short to be effective on all types of breads (varying loaf sizes, etc.). Add a longer paring knife and a carving or boning knife instead of the bread knife and this set would get five stars."
4,Nicely calming.,"I was having some hypothyroid symptoms,and this product helped to calm me down a bit.It definitely worked.Effective,especially before bed.I reccomend it."
2,the cover ripped after 2 weeks of being on the grill,"I would like to know if I could have a replacement? I purchased this item for a Christmas gift for my husband. 2 weeks after having it on his grill it has ripped? Prob. from the cold, however it is a grill cover. For outside? I am shocked at this and would like to know if I could be shipped a new one. I will return the ripped one we have? Thank you"
1,Great set...but,"The main knives in this set are advertised... from the Pro S line, beautiful and excellent quality.However, nowhere in the product description does it say that the steak knives are not Pro S knives, but in fact serrated much lower quality knives from the Gourmet line.I had gone back and forth in my mind between buying Henckels or Wusthof knives, and was incredibly impressed with some non-serrated Wusthof knives the other night at a nice steakhouse. To find out that I had inadvertently bought a set of lower-end serrated knives was a disappointment. I would have willingly paid more for an all Pro S set of knives, so this is unfortunate."
2,Contents misleading,"I recently purchased the 18-piece block set. I have not had enough time to evaluate the quality of the Pro S knives so won't comment at this time. However, all buyers should be advised that the steak knives are NOT Pro S, they are Twin Gourmet, a lower quality of Henckels knives (and about 30% of the value). Regardless of how these knives perform, I do not like to be duped. The main knives are all Pro S, but i noticed the steak knives where not what I expected and looked more closely. The Twin Gourmet 4-piece steak knives sell for about $40 on Amazon; the Pro S steak knives sell for $150. In other words, this block set is not at all worth the money. I stretched to buy this especially because I wanted the steak knives for the future. You would be better off buying a Pro S starter set or small block set, buy whatever steak knives you really want, and add the remaining pieces you need. You will likely spend less and be happier with your purchase."
4,Steak Knives not Pro-S,"I haven't played with the knives yet, however you can tell they are high quality by feel. I've had the twin signature set and cut with them and these are better. The steak knives are not the Pro-S series. Something much cheaper and stamped, not forged. The $1000 set has all the Pro-S knives. Steak knives seem to be pretty good and considering the added expense for the Pro-S steak set and the extensive use my steak knives get, not sure if I'm upset at them not being Pro-S, since I can buy about 8 new sets compared to one of the Pro-S steak knife sets. All in all, very nice set"
5,Amazing Knife Set,It is so nice to have a real knife set. These knives cut with precision. I would highly recommend this set to anyone looking for an excellent knife set for their kitchen. I did a ton a research and this knife set has 100% lived up to all of the positive reviews that I read about it.
1,Painful Reading,"An amateurish effort, full of poor writing, exclamation marks and half-formed ideas. This is little more than a C+ college essay.Perez and Boggs are both worthy of serious treatment. Perez in particularly was a fascinating character, a powerful man who held great sway over his corner of the earth. He's worthy of a full-scale biography. Boggs, too, was riddled with contradictions. This book treats both as cartoonish, two-dimensional characters: Boggs good; Perez bad. This book does neither man justice. I was left wanting more, and angry I'd wasted my time and money."
3,Swedish softcore,"A nice record, very hard to find though, with 13 songs that'll make you realize that the world needs softcore, which Chester Copperpot is.By the way, i think that the name is taken from the Steven Spielberg movie ""the Goonies""."
5,Simply amazing,"I bought this CD at Walmart because I liked the title ""American By God's Amazing Grace."" I sure am glad I did. The title track provides a little glimpse into what our service men and women are doing for us on the other side of the world in Iraq. After listening to this CD, I can appreciate all the more what these folks are doing for us over there. While the title track(s) is(are) probably my favorite, there is not a single song on this CD that I don't like.Luke Stricklin has a voice and style similar to Toby Keith, who happens to be one of my favorite performers, so it should come as no surprise I like this CD, too. He is an artist that I am sure will become quite popular once people start to hear about him."
5,Great lyrics,"I definitely suggest this CD. I think the song American By God's Amazing Grace has some really powerful lyrics. My favorite being:""It breaks my heart to see these kids out on the streetswalking barefoot through the trash, diggin' for something to eat.I give them what I got, just to let them know I careand I thank God it's not my son that's standing there.""It's a really good CD."
3,Calphalon is great...so great that you don't need nonstick,"I'm rating this product 3 stars, because I have its hard-anodized cousin and would give that a five star rating without a second thought.Teflon is an easily scratched fluorocarbon, with essentially no advantages over a nice heavy anodized pan. I clean my non-coated pans with a simple sponge, with a warm water soak if I let something cake on.In short, save ten bucks and the heartache of seeing fork-scratches on your brand new nonstick. Get the hard-anodized version, season it by heating vegetable oil in it until it starts to smoke and then let it cool to room temperature, and it will do everything this pot will: backwards and in heels."
4,Very good pan,This is the perfect pan for a single person or two-person household because it is a small size. I like the tall sides and use it for stir-frying small batches.
1,Extremely poor coating and customer service,"I have had this pan for less than 6 months and the coating is aleady scratching and peeling. I have used only non-stick utensils and a soft sponge to clean. However- the coating is not durable enough to hold up to plastic utensils over time. Eventually- it does cause scratching/peeling. Infact I have several other ""Commercial Caplphalon"" pans and the same thing happens over 6-8 months. I am very unhappy with the pan and the customer service. I will never buy anything from Calphalon again. Probably why the ""Commercial"" pan is discontinued in the stores."
2,"A non-taoist, western approach to TCM","It is unfortunate to describe the wu hsing as the five elements. Elements are fixed, particularly in a Western mind. A literal translation would be the five moving forces. A taoist would know that these moving forces are an idea, a way of coming to grips with a very complex subject. The most glaring error is to say Ch'i Kung is contra-indicated for psychiatric diseases. Having treated several thousand patients I can safely say that not only is this nonsense, but it is often the best possible treatment for psych. diseases."
2,BAD INSTRUCTIONS,IT IS A LITTLE AWKWARD TO HOLD WITH THE CORD ATTACHED. THE INSTRUCTIONS ARE NOT COMPLETE. I HAD TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PUT ON THE ATTACHMENTS THROUGH TRIAL AND ERROR. NO INFO ON THE DIFFERENT GRIND SETTINGS. MY DOG IS NOT TOO FOND OF THE NOISE EITHER.
5,Anatomia,"Me encanta la voz de esta mujer, y si a eso le agregas temas con letras interesantes y bien producidas el resultado es Anatomia, que mal que no gano el grammy, pero bueno es la prueba de que la buena musica nunca es popular.-Es curioso, pero Anatomia de Ana Belen E Invierno Sur de Paloma San Basilio, tienen la misma atmosfera, un estlio muy similar, ambos son unos discasos, a esto es a lo que yo llamo musica."
1,Not worth the money,I realize this cd is now sold used so you can pick it up cheap. I still dont think it was worth the used price as you most likely will only listen to once.I have always been a fan of SNL and their musical guests. There have been some real great moments and great guests over the year. This cd is several years old and the time frame of the guests / songs chosen is narrow. None of the songs convey any real angst or emotion except for the Pretenders (I never get tired of that song). Perhaps the these songs were special when you see them on tv but on the cd it does not translate to the greatest performances on SNL.I have listened to this cd no more than 5 times and have owned it since it first came out which was years ago.
1,YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDIN' ME,"One of the greatest if not the greatest live performance I've heard or seen is not presented on this CD. That's right the greatest. I don't know or have ever really know anything about Neil Young, but his live performance of ROCKIN'IN THE FREE WORLD on SNL almost put tears to my eyes. Utterly speachless. It was'nt that it was such an emotional performance or anything, but that the fact was that this old fart would have rocked Kurt Cobain's or anyone elses young butt. Trully a powerful and insperational song.Get the DVD it's the only official release of the song."
1,What a shame....,"The real talent from SNL is not on this CD (cast and guest stars). Where else could we have gotten Queen singing ""Crazy Little Thing Called Love?"""
2,disappointing.......,"I was very excited about getting this cd based on all the great reviews written here. I had never heard Incognito before but it sounded like they kicked ***! But I must say I was a bit disappointed with this. The name jazzfunk makes me think that its going to be some kind of booty-shakin band with jamming horns ala James Brown-style but instead this is what Kenny G would sound like if he was black. This is smooth jazz with a few funky bass lines. If you're looking for party music that you can't help but dance to, this AIN'T IT!!!!"
5,Historical Baseball Writing at its Best.,"David Nemec gives us a gritty rendering of what baseball and life were like in the mid-1800s in this well written and certainly well researched novel. His portraits of real baseball personages, ranging from Cap Anson to Moses Walker, ring true and to the mark."
5,a foriegn turist viewpoint,"I am a world traveler and have lived in Argentina, Columbia, and Israel. It is my understanding that Walks, Hikes and Strolls is for ""mature folks"". I am a young tourist in the United States for the first time as an adult and I appreciate finding a guide book that is easily understandable and points out many important things in a way that looks out for my safety, my body and my sanity. What a pleasure to be in a strange land and have such competent directions and instructions at my finger tips. I hope that many other people from other countries are as lucky as I have been to come accross this book. Good hiking to everyone!"
1,These work but there's a better one,"Seriously, if you are going to try a cookie diet you have to use R&D; Diet Cookie. They are WAY cheaper and I think they work and taste better. I suggest you use them to lose your initial 10 to 30 lbs then change the program a little. Instead of the low 800 calories per day, eat a couple for breakfast and maybe even lunch then just make better food choices for the rest of the day. Also, have them for a late night snack. You will still lose weight but it will be a little slower but a lot easier.R&D; Cookie Diet Meal Replacement Cookies - 2 weeks Assorted FlavorsI also wanted to mention I tried all 3 (Hollywood, seigal, smart for life) at one time or another... all tasted OK but still left me a little hungry. I simply believe the R&D; Diet Cookies work better. More science behind them."
1,SUCKERS HOOK!!!,"If I am going to spend that much money and only loose 10 Lbs in two months I will minus exercise 6 times a week and do the ""kellogg challenge""!!! More nutritious and less expensive and they claim that you can loose up to 6 Lbs in TWO WEEKS not two months!!! If I am going to spend that much money I want to loose at least 3 lbs per week!!! Why don't you people just eat two yogurts instead of two cookies?? Two bowls of cereal? Two slim fast or other meal substitute? It is the same and less expensive!!! I rest my case... no cookie for me!"
4,It works!,My wife and I tried the cookie diet to see if we could jump start our weight loss. If you stick to it this diet will work. We lost about 5 pounds the first week. We were also working out 4 times a week but the weight came off faster than any other diet we have tried in the past. We have only tried the chocolate chips and for the most part they taste pretty good. My wife likes them better than I do. I feel they taste a little bland but what can you expect from a low calorie cookie.We bought our first box at CVS for 20 dollars so Amazon's price is fantastic. This isnt a diet for the long term but to start off your weight loss I think it is a pretty good diet to try.
3,tastes good,the chocolate chip cookie tastes good but i don't think it can replace a meal.for me anyway.i was hungry less then 2 hrs later. better alternative to high calorie snacks but pretty expensive.
1,This book is not helpful at all,"This book is not helpful in identifying teacups at all. Of the thousands and thousands of styles and designs of teacps that exist, this book shows pictures of only about 200. Most of the pictures are dark or unclear and no maker's marks are shown. This book is basically just one person's collection and is no help to other collectors."
1,BEWARE!!! MISSING 20 PAGES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Too bad someone didn't bother to edit this book - especially as it is a SECOND EDITION! It not only is missing 20 pgs (in the early 100s from what I recall - I sent book back and hope for a refund), it also had 20 duplicate pages! I can't believe NO ONE here who raved about this book noticed this! It's one thing to buy it and get pleaure looking at pictures of someone's pretty cups, but quite another when you are doing research and spending money on books! Checking for brands in the index and not finding a page listed is how I found this gross error! A lot of cups would have been covered on those 20 missing pages. The seller I purchased book from said ""it was publishing error and not picked up on reprint"" and had the nerve to ask ME to ""let him know if I find one that was corrected"" as he said all books are like this. Unless the seller is misrepresenting...I say ""BOO"" to the editors/publishers - no excuse on 2nd edition!)"
4,A good starting place,This book is great for finding different cup and saucer types.I would like to have had more information on pottery markings included in the book. Wish the authors had a web-site for questions.
1,nice collectible book if you receive it,Company never contacted me that I was not going to receive the book. Amazon does not state how to contact them quite disappointing. Did get my money back.
2,Not what i was expecting,"What could have been a really awesome graphic study, comparing rural towns of the Appalachians, turned out to be a just maps and essays. Interesting idea though."
5,Charles,"Of course the Proclaimers have many cliche themes on this CD like beer-drinking, girls and Scottish nationalism. But two constant themes prevail throughout: The ecstasy of God and the ecstasy of sex. This group does some of the best country/folk ballads I have ever heard. What makes them unique is their wonderful two-part harmonies and thick scottish accents. It is a real treat to hear them pronounce names like Tupelo Mississippi. And when they sing King of the road in their thick accents it sounds wonderfully incongruous. Can you imagine two scottish hobbos traveling in a box car to Banger Maine. You know in Scotland they have different names for cigarettes and trailers. I got a signed copy of this CD when the Proclaimers performed in Vancouver.The two lads have unique personalities. Buy this CD, you won't be dissappointed."
4,Liked it!,"I really liked this cd. It always put's me in a good mood, no matter how angery or depressed I am. I love track one, I'm gonna be, I can put it on repeat and lissten to that one track for hours. I reccommend it to anyone who loves fun, entertaining songs."
2,"don't buy album for just ""I'm Gonna Be""","I bought this album because I loved the single, ""I'm Gonna Be"", however I found that the rest of the album wasn't to my liking. Before buying this cd, make sure to listen to some of the other songs. If you just like ""I'm Gonna Be"" get the Benny and June soundtrack."
3,Too Plain and Way Too Perfumed,"***This Earl Grey Tea from Stash is plain, and definitely not subtle because of a strong bergamot component---way too strong! If you really, really love bergamot you may like it, but I much prefer a more subtle and more complex tea. It tastes like perfumed black tea; I could hardly drink it. I could not tell the difference between it and Stash's Double Bergamot Black Tea---both are just swimming in oil of bergamot. I am an Earl Grey fan, but just couldn't stomach this tea.It seems like the quality of the black tea is very good, though, because even with a longer brewing time, the tea did not become bitter...so, if you can stand being hit over the head with the bergamot flavor, you might enjoy it.Only recommended for those who want a strongly perfumed bergamot Earl Grey.***"
4,Energy boost,"I have been taking these tablets with a stable diet including the Hollywood Diet oatmeal raisin cookies. These tablets did boost my energy level significantly. Maybe there was some placebo effect, but I doubt it. I have some other pain related problems that lower my ability to participate in much physical exercise other than swimming and walking. I have lost 21 pounds in 5 months, slow but steady. And, I can now walk a steady paced mile which I hadn't done for at least 3 years. I am sure it's an individual thing, but I did feel these helped me and have ordered more."
5,"Very well made, and exelent Quality","The order came on time, the box was wet with a little damage, but no damage inside. The quality of the keyboard stand is excelent and works perfect with my Yahama PSR E423"
1,I should have saved my money,"I bought this item to support a Yamaha Keyboard, and in fairness the stand does hold the keyboard. As long as you do not try adjusting the height, it works. The ""clutch"" mechanism does not work and there is no instruction concerning how to make it work.It is very difficult to get your legs near the keyboard which is based upon the ""X"" stand construction. I have now replaced the stand with a small table which works very well.The website for this product offer almost no help."
5,stage keyboard stand ks8291xx pro double,"rated 5 star because so easy to set up and take down,i like it because its sturdy and works easy,its heavy compare to cheap ones you know your keyboard will stay on it,if it gets bumped.i would buy one for any of my musican friends,you will love it too."
5,Very Sturdy for my MOX8,"I had a single bar and decided it just made sense to have higher quality stand for a keyboard like the MOX8 I bought. I have dogs that run around and sometimes the little one runs between my keyboard, I hate it, but this gave some extra sturdiness and I dont worry about it falling over no more. I love how the stand adjusts also. Little lever at the top is so cool. great design, very sturdy! Worth the money."
4,"Little pricey, but good","Product is well constructed & easy to put together (took me 10 minutes).Leaning on it, I wish it was a little more stable, but I have yet to put my coffin (I'm a DJ) on it. I'm using it at home, so I think it will work out well. It's not terribly unstable, just wobbles a tiny bit."
3,If you get a deal on it,"This shelf is part of the 4 for 3 promotion so if you're already buying 3 things for $50, this makes a nice fourth. Very simple construction, the plated frame holds 3 oval shelves, and attaches to the wall at only two points.I got it to use in my bathroom and it makes a nice piece. I keep my little guest soaps and small bathroom decor items on it.One caveat if you get one: the two clips it hangs on look like they can be installed either way. They are not symmetrical and have a top and bottom to them. Once you realize this, installation takes about 10 minutes with a lievel and a screwdriver.Although I wouldn't pay $50 for this item, as a bonus item I am quite satisfied with this item."
3,Could be cooler,"They're not aviator goggles but they certainly do to job, protect from the sun and bright glare, keep out debris, dust, bugs and what not. You can see through high winds. Gets a little uncomfortable after wearing it for a long while."
2,the goggles fogged,"I loved the style and fit of these goggles, but I bought them to use while skiing. It stated that they would not fog, but I had problems with them fogging the first time I used them. I will try to wipe them with the anti-fog wipes and see if that helps the next time."
2,"Red glasses are bad, ""no fog"" is not working","Red glass has absolutely no sun protection. Also, the glasses becomes fogged very fast.But for this money, maybe it's OK."
3,Not bad,I like these guys but for biking stick to somthing that you can take on and off they fog up some but once you get going the wind helps alot. I still recomend this and would buy it again.
2,Not built to last,"I bought a pair of these over two years ago, but interior lining began to come off around six months in, and the ""No Fog"" function only ever worked if there was wind. Stop cycling for a second to catch your breath, and the goggles fog up right away. Sometimes a stray bug still managed to find its way inside when I was riding, though I've no idea how."
4,Works Great,"I recently purchased one of the GMRS / FRS / GPS tranceivers. It works great. I have one of the original Magellian GPS's from the days when they first came out. It has many of the same features however, the speed of finding GPS sattelites is much faster. Also, the radio features work great."
5,Heart Beat Blanket does the job right.,"[...]This product is awesome. I got it for a newborn gift, and have seen it being used. The mom loves it. I plan on purchasing more, for future shower/baby gifts.I simply do not know why, if people do not have a good buying or selling experience, they vote low stars on their subjective feelings and this has nothing to do with this products rating. Therefore, it presents as a not so good product.Why not write a review on your experience as a buyer/seller and rate the product accurately, and separate from a dissatisfied buyer/seller????"
1,$0.65 for 448 pages says it all. History from non scholars,"Frankly the book is OK to read if you don't care about facts. Authors clearlydon't have any background in historical analysis and are not scholars on Jewish history. Lots of material based on selective and dubious sources.Great book an highly praised one is of course the one and the only Paul Johnson, who is the real historian- not those two jokers. If you have an extra $ 0.65 and have any use of 448 useless pages, please buy this book."
4,Fun Easy Read,Mike Mason loves his job but when he's left showing the city to the bosses niece Gina he wonders how long he'll have it. Not only is Gina ready for big city fun but she brought a warddrobe that her parents would never approve of.She's a temptation he's not sure he can handle especially after being celibate for so long. Especially when she makes it clear that she wants to shake her catholic school girl image and learn everything about sex that Mike is willing to teach.Temptation at it's best.
1,Disappointing,"I love most Books by Debbi Rawlins. Unfortunately, this book didn't live up to my expectations. I found it hard it difficult to relate."
4,She was a virgin......right,"It was a nice cute read. I read it in one day, and liked it. I was a story I could believe. I really liked this book because they didn't fall in love after 2 days. Come on. They worked on their relationship for weeks and didn't jump into bed after meeting each other. That rarely happens in real life."
3,Coconuts!,"For those of you looking for a cocoa or chocolate fragrance, this is not it. Coco Perfume is not chocolate or cocoa, so be warned. It's coconut, and it's quite strong. Smells nearly identical to Hawaiian Tropic Coconut Oil, so if you want to smell like you've been summer sunbathing, this is your fragrance."
1,used book received with a used-used edition,"I ordered the book ""management techniques for librairans"", 1983 edition-- according to the web ad. But when I received it, I was EXTREAMLY dissapointed because the seller sent me a 1976 edition. The Table of Content, as well as the content of the whole book, is totally not identical with the 1983 edition. (I happen to have a (1983 ed.)copy checked out from UC Davis library, so I can compare it right after I opened the package). My first experience buying used book is VERY unpleasant. Unless I can get refund from the seller, Laura and Dwayne Pearen, I don't think I will buy used books again--Just to avoid the hassel."
4,Great '90s Dance Hits,This is a great comprehensive collection of dance hits from the late '80s and early '90s. Some of the singles are very hard to find anywhere else.
5,Wonderful Halloween Fantasy,"Educational, inspirational, fun and wonderful! This is one of the most thoughtful explanations for the rituals of a great holiday in recent years. I loved the story line and the illustrations were superb. This should be in every childs trick or treat bag for Halloween!Prof. John F. Kelly"
5,Not Just for Fairy Lovers.,"I bought this book when it was first published in 2005 and have brought it out every Halloween since. It has been through 3 grandchildren, and all have loved it and shared it with their classmates. Absolute best Halloween book ever...for all ages."
5,The Civil War rulz,"Man, I can't imagine a better war than the Civil War. And this is one of the best books on that war. This book is for all those guys who dress up on the weekend and pretend to be real soldiers. These kind of guys are the best kind of guys in the world, buffs. These buffs should try playing with real ammo and real war time conditions. As a vietnam vet, I know first hand war is really hell. I have to live with this hell the rest of my life. These buffs should try a real war on for size. Peace out!"
5,Trivia at it's best!,This is a well researched book loaded with little known facts about the Civil War and it's participants.The author has included not only some of the more well known facts but also some facts and figures not easily found in most of today's books on the war. Well written in a question and answer format this is an entertaining book you will find hard to put down and at 271 pages can be read in a short time. The only set back is that it takes such little time to read that you are left wanting more. I give it 5 stars!!
5,Well done !,"A simplified explanation of your baby's attributes based on astrological concepts. an easy to read and understand format that gives you extra insight into your baby's behavior, and also lets you remember more about your childhood. It might be fun to actually talk to your parents about your infancy after you have read this wonderful book. When I read my Scorpio/Aries/Sag attributes, it verified what my parents and grandparents had said about my infancy, and it verifies some of my behaviors as an adult !! As an amateur astrologist, I appreciate how this book takes the multi-facited work of astrology and simplies it for the busy parent, aunt or uncle, teacher, or anyone who wants to know more about babies' behaviors. Children are everyone's future !"
5,"Excellent introduction to the ""invisible"" world around us.","Why do you feel exhausted around some people, and energized around others? What is that pain in your back trying to tell you? Why is it as important to cleanse your aura as it is your physical body? Judith Poole addresses Poole has given us an excellent introduction to the ""invisible"" world around us, and how it affects us--whether or not we are aware of it! Her descriptions are easy enough for the general reader to understand, but not condescending. The advanced energy worker may also find new information here. She also provides easy exercises to help learn mastery of this--to many--unknown realm. This book will be invaluable to students and teachers of energy alike. I recommend it to all of my Shamballa/Reiki students."
1,"Looks nice, just doesn't sound good.","I took a chance on this phone even after reading some less than complimentary reviews. I returned the phone for the following reasons:- Volume is very low, even when set at maximum.- Voice clarity is very poor. Sounds like a cell phone.- The speakerphone cuts in and out so you end up holding it to your ear anyway."
4,Phones are a nice system in home,"We had two of these phones, and on one of them the buttons quit working (wouldn't register when pushed); but, it's compact, and otherwise works well. We then purchased several of them to put throughout the house because of the intercom feature (can call each other from different parts of our home) and the fact they're not bulky phones. There is good reception, and can be used outside."
4,Worth the Extra Handset.,"I actually purchased this phone a few years ago when it cost a good bit more than it does now and would still reccomend it at teh original price. I moved from a 2 bedroom small condo into a 3000+ sqft house and still have amazing range. I will only caution you that the expandable handset is a must because the ringers aren't very loud and the speakerphone on the base isn't as clear as the new wave of speakerphones. However, the handsfree speaker option on teh actual handset souns just like you are talking on the phone, none of that echo ""can you hear me now"" effect."
5,Fine Monk playing,"Almost all modern jazz pianists play Monk, whose tunes are their Well-Tempered Clavier. However, this album, the first, I believe, by Danilo Perez, is exceptionally spirited and non-perfunctory. Perez performs the always-challenging trick of being faithful to the original sense of these highly idiosyncratic tunes, and yet injects his own individual sense of time, blues, and Pan-American sensibility. I have found almost all of Perez' recordings after this disappointing by comparison, which is too bad. I don't really understand why. But this is highly recommended."
5,"For listening or thinking, a great performance","I love this CD and enjoy it both as background music and as music to think about. Even better, my toddler loves this and already says jazz is her favorite kind of music!"
2,Not very good,"""Lip Fence""?? I thought I was buying an eye highlighter. In any case, there is hardly any product at all in the container, and what there is--especially the pencil side--does pretty much nothing. The powder end could be good if there were more of it and it were more accessible."
2,Don't waste your money,I don't see a difference in the way the lipstick adheres. It appears to be the same with or without the lip fence. Not recommended. Expensive for no results.
1,Short Duration,"I purchased this on the 13th and by the 20th, it was no good. I was leary about buying something that was non-Sony, etc but it was cute! I bought it for my 4 year old's cross-country trip and while reviewing it's usage at home prior to her trip, there was so much static that we couldn't hear the songs. Then, the static disappeared but now the volume doesn't work. We can only hear the music at a low volume. I suggest you spend a little more and go for name brands like I will be doing!"
3,Cute but poor sound quality,Cute for a CD player but the volume isn't very loud. My daughter has a hard time hearing the CD's so she gets bored with it easily.
1,Bought two and both have had to be replaced,"I wouldn't recommend this product. I purchased two of these for my daughters for Xmas. They both worked great for a few months, then they stopped working (one in March, the second in April). I returned each for a replacement. Spectra (the distributor) replaced them with no questions asked, but I wonder how much longer they are going to last before they break again."
3,a little noise,"It is a little noisy while my daughter is listening the CD. I think my daughter likes it, but is a little anoying for me."
5,Another Undiscovered Gem,"A wonderful disk covering a wide range of musical styles but somehow distinctly European. Brilliant use of instrumentation, especially the woodwind and some very fine piano playing. Thoroughly recommended to anybody looking for something refreshingly different from the current crop of predictable US mainstream jazz releases. Deserves to be a big seller but destined to become just another unappreciated gem."
3,Kitcsh!,"I use this for a window display at my store. It looks good, catches attention and brings a piece of the Las Vegas Strip to any occasion. No thanks on the pushbutton Elvis song though."
4,"Dated, but valuable resource","Look up your plant and read through a whole list of common insect and disease problems for that species. It's that simple. The descriptions are concise and most of the major plant species and their problems are covered.A stong word of caution about this book. Pesticides come and go and the lables change. Since this book was published (1979), most of the chemicals recomended in it have gone off label and are no longer available. Check with your local Extension office for current control recomendations. Aside from that, this is still an excellent place to start for pest identification."
2,"Not quite a book, more of a pamphlet","While the book does have a listing of spanish words an educator may use, you'll receive it in a tiny pamphlet, not quite a book. Both tiny in size and content, your money is best spent elsewhere."
3,Others Work Better for Me,"I was using this connector to put in a mailbox post. This was just the second time I put in a post this way and I am not a very experienced do-it-yourselfer. The spike went easily into the ground and did not budge. However, using screws to hold the post did not give as tight a fit as the clamping type I had used previously. I will use the clamp type for future projects."
4,14 kt gold turtle charm,"This charm looks nice but it turned out that the one i received has some slight differences to the one in the photo: Mine has a smaller head than the loop above the head. Also the gold is not a deep gold color like it appears to be on the picture, it is a med-light color. Also the body of the turtle is not evenly rounded, rather a slightly bent- over body . So Overall the charm is very nice but I imagined it to be a darker gold, and more rounded, and a slightly thicker body, that the one I received."
3,Good plot,"Pros: Exciting plot that kept me wanting to know more. Thought-provoking, as it makes you realize how vulnerable children are and the importance of protecting them from harm.Cons: There is barely a page in my kindle edition that doesn't have glaring typos, i.e. a word randomly appearing in the text that has nothing to do with the sentence, grammatical errors, numerous words spelled wrong. I can put up with one or two in a book; most texts have a couple, but there were so many in this book that it was distracting. Also, the book opened with a rather vivid description of a sex scene. It really didn't fit - the story could have opened just as well with reference to the incidence."
5,Could Not Put This Down!,"I was hooked from page 1. I found the plot gripping, the execution creative and suspenseful. I loved the characters - expecially Leigh and her son Jeremy. Even Nora was interesting, albeit ""dysfunctional"". I was definitely entertained, but I'd say this was a step (at least) above a simple ""beach book"". Five stars!"
1,Not for me,"I made it a quarter of the way thru this book and had to stop. I love suspense books, but this one involving murdering children was too much for me. From the first page it's quite graphic regarding violence against infants and children. I just couldn't keep reading it. It made me feel sick."
5,Wonderful memories live on,"A remarkable collection of songs by my all-time favorite singer, most of the songs are her own creations. A great addition to a music collection of anyone who is interested in Anna German's legacy."
3,Moisturizing,The best way to use this sloughing lotion is to rub about half an inch of cream into dry feet. If your feet are wet it will take longer for the cream to dry out. Once it starts to dry you will see little bits of skin peeling off. I suggest you sit with your feet in the tub for the best results. Then you can just wash the bits of dry skin down the drain. This will not immediately remove all the dry skin on your feet like if you have calloused skin it might take a while to get all the dry skin off. I'd suggest using a file and then using this product afterwards. It is very moisturizing and you don't have to wash it off after you apply it. This product is perfect for people who like to go barefoot or wear sandals. If you use this a few times a week you will see results. I use this in place of an Avon product that is no longer sold. Yes your feet will feel slightly tingly from the peppermint oil.~The Rebecca Review
3,Works okay,Product works okay but not as well as whatever the lady at the spa used for my pedicure there - or maybe it's just easier to use it on someone else's feet than it is to try and do your own?
3,One Flaw,"I have been using this meter for a month now. As far as a volt meter,continuity checker and ohms meter I consider this to be well worth the price paid. It's only flaw and the reason I purchased this one is the transistor hfe meter, I have placed about 8 pnp transistors in the input and did not get any response until I placed a thumb on the transistor and applied some pressure, not knowing its internal design that method gives me concern for the long term durability of that aspect of the meter."
1,Pay a little more and maybe you'll get something that works.,"This multimeter is worthless. It didn't even work the first time I tried to use it. I would have returned it, but I missed my return window. Morals of this story: don't buy a cheap, crappy multimeter and don't wait to test it until the day you need it for a school project."
3,It Works OK,"This is not a Fluke nor is it even a Radio Shack, but the price is right and as an occasional household tool the DT830 works well enough. However If you are an electronic hobbyist this meter will probably not meet your needs. The Ohm-meter function works poorly in it's lower ranges and the diode check has no feedback tone. I could go on about its crude finish, but it's still a bargain if you need something cheap and expendable."
1,Not a good product,This is junk. At first the display missing digit. Then I can't read it. Now the red plug to the test socket breaks. I think you better buy a more expensive meter.
3,Disposable convenience,"As others have said, good for the price but keep your expectations reasonable. I carry it in our racing trailer so I won't be upset if it gets lost or broken, but didn't realize that to change the batteries you need to have a mini Philips screwdriver (jeweler size, which I didn't have). So waited till I got home and then broke one of the cheap Chinese screws trying to get it out. But still works OK with one less screw holding it in...."
5,Used as a 10A Ammeter Shunt,"For the price, I could not pass this up. I wish it had a separate On/Off switch, since I am using it for a specific feature.Read a few poor reviews, but knowing what I needed it for, I ordered it. For this price, I cannot even buy the components to build it myself. Accuracy is solid (compares to another device, in line, at 2 decimal places. I am pulling 0.05 - 8.50 A through it for hours some times...My biggest problem is forgetting to turn it off...I cannot say how its other features work."
2,Digital multimeter dt830B,"This is the worst multi meter I've ever own, wanted a digital meter that was easy to read and use at a cheap price. Cheap is what it is, the instructions might as well been in Chinese. Go figure, wasn't worth the return threw in garbage. Don't waste your money, you get what you pay for didn't work out of the box , should have know better."
3,Does everything,"Kinda amazing, do everything meter. Hard to belevee all the functions.. but I don't really need that many. Kinda cheap feel, small"
1,Piece of junk,"This arrived DOA. The multimeter worked OK I think. I don't really know how to read one, but I do know that the leads did not work at all."
2,It was broken out of the box.,"I got this because it was the cheapest DMM I could find and I just needed it periodically. I took it out of the box, plugged in the probes, set the dial, and tested the wall socket. Zero volts. Turned the dial and tested a AAA battery: zero volts. Checked the instructions and yeah, I'm using it right. I took out the probes and found that a metal ring holding the ground probe had fallen off the circuit board. Had to open up the unit and jam it back on there. Works fine now but it's certainly cheap."
1,Peice of carp,"Bought this thing CHEAP at a tool warehouse intending to use it for odd jobs. Worked fine for a few days and I was happy with my purchase. Then it sat in my box for about 6 months and when I went to use it again, it is nearly useless. Some of the functions result in a dead screen, and the ones that do show up will not give any useful readings. It gave me a reading of 2.8 volts when checking a half-dead 1.5v battery. Some of the readings had broken characters (like 0.0L, or 1h.F).I thought maybe its battery was dead so replaced it with a brand new Duracell 9V, but it didn't make any difference.I like cheap things, but this was not worth the extra hour of my life trying to find out why it wasn't working."
1,Garbage,"Worked a few times and died.Came with dead, or nearly so, battery. Used another VOM to establish this.Initially a basic instrument suitable for go/no-go tests."
1,Garbage,There's a reason this product is as cheap as it is. It came with a dead battery. A 9V battery cost about half the price of the multimeter. The values I read didn't stabilize. Got an Extech instead.
2,flimsy prodect,"The item worked out of the box, as I tested it and put it aside for later use. In 3 days, when I needed it, it didn't work.I'm an electrical engineer and fixing up these things is what I'm good at, so I opened it up and realized that the design is quite poor. The PCB that holds the wire connector is connected to the main PCB only through 3 solder junctions! This is ridiculous, everyone knows solder itself is brittle and can easily break. So what happens is that if you push the wire connector too much, it will transfer the force to the first PCB, and since it is only connected to the chassis and the second PCB through three solder junctions, one of them will break!Well I patched it up and made it work again, but I don't expect the majority of people trying to fix this thing. Once fixed, it worked like a regular multimeter.Be warned!"
3,No auto-off,"I got this multitester through Amazon a few years ago at a great price, about $7. I use it occasionally for minor tasks like checking batteries and testing continuity. So as to whether it's accurate or not, I will defer to other reviewers. After a few years, the product still seems to work OK for my purposes. The big problem for me is that there's no auto-off. I don't know anyone who is going to remember to turn a device like this off every time, despite the best of intentions. So whatever you save in purchase price may be lost several times over in the cost of installing new batteries. It takes one 9-volt battery -- those rectangularish ones -- the alkaline versions of which can cost $5 or $6 apiece. If you get this multitester, I would use only rechargeable or inexpensive non-alkaline batteries."
3,"Great price, mostly functional","Can't beat the price, but the DC voltage seems to be reading half of what it should. Other functions work fine and for the price it's not worth trying to return."
2,Pretty cheap unit,ljlk ljlik lkjl lkj opiu oih oih oljkhn oih lkn oih lkh oijh lkj oijh lk oi lk oi lk
2,SAVE YOUR MONEY!,"This meter is simply not accurate when measured against a superior meter. I suspect calibration issues. Although minor, the item picture shows a black meter, I received a yellow meter. Would not recommend nor buy again."
3,"Dead on Arrival, but only the leads were faulty","This unit didn't work on arrival. I had ordered this to test my PC's power supply unit and was initially frustrated as it was very hard to figure out whether the multimeter was not working or the power supply was faulty.I eventually tried the self test; Put the multimeter in resistance mode and bring both the leads together, the reading should be close to 0. In this case, I was seeing a very high reading. I tried replacing one of the leads with a handheld paper clip and could see the correct zero resistance. Apparently only the lead was faulty.I am still returning the product because replacing the lead will probably cost more than the cost of this. However, I still give it 3 stars since the product is still priced well and if you get a good piece (working unit) then its well worth the price."
1,DC and AC volts don't work at all,"When I initially tested the product with DC current and Ohms, it appeared to work well, so I assumed that the whole meter is fine. It turns out that the DC and AC volts give bizarre wrong readings. Now I have missed the window to contact the seller, however, I have withdrawn the positive feedback and won't buy this type of product again. My bad for not having fully tested it initially where I could have perhaps got a replacement or a full refund."
1,JUNK!,I ordered 20 of these to use in a classroom and ended up having to throw away half of them immediately because they didn't work properly. Save yourself the hassle and pay a little more for a better quality meter.
1,Display broke within a few weeks,"I used this once, and was very happy with it. A couple months later, when I wanted to use it again, the digital display was pretty much dead. It's as if some of the ""sticks"" that form each digit are dead, so the display shows a set of random bars, completely illegible."
3,Hard to read,It all looks the same in the readings. You can't tell the A/C from the D/C like most testers. It more you flip a coin. Most units you get from Radio Shack has a A/C side and a D/C side.
3,A classic,"This tome is a timeless classic in many ways. It is a good place to start. There are some areas that need updating to add the new developments that have occurred. Bevis was a fresh contributor to nursing education in her time. She helped to move nursing education forward. However, I think that we need to further develop the strategies and actual competence of those that graduate from our programs. She makes it clear that this is an evolvng process."
5,A fair representation of the representative American poet,"This collection contains twenty- four pieces from the work of America's greatest poet. Whitman is the quintessential American poet the one who speaks for the heart of the nation, the great cataloguer of its vast varied landscape and life. Great poems such as ""When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloomed"" and "" I sing the body electric"" provide the reader here with a true sense of Whitman's work.Whitman with all his greatness can at times be plodding and tiring, and turn the open- road catalogue into a formula-like list. But mostly he is the celebrator of the American people in their great outward expansion through their own cosmic continent.This work is represents fairly the one who even in his own time Emerson saw as the great representative American poet."
3,It's Whitman...,"All of Whitman's work is public domain, so you can find it online for free. The only reason to buy this book is if you want a hard copy."
1,Comentario negativo,En esta oportunidad mi comentario es que la pieza jamas llego a mis manos en realidad no se de quienb es la culpabilidad pero lo deje pasar porque en realidad no le tome importancia pero es lo unico que puedo decir.
3,Inexpensive Bags that Work,"This is a bit of the classic - seems too good to be true - based upon the manufacturer's description of the product. These vacuum cleaner bags are described in a manner that makes these bags appear to be a better bag at a great price. However once they arrived, I realized why they were such a good price. The quality of the paper is half the quality of the bags I purchase for my Electrolux. But with that said, they work. They hold the dirt and isn't that what you're looking for? You are not getting anything more than that no matter what the claims are from the manufacturer. These are an inexpensive choice in a vacuum cleaner bag if you are in need of saving costs. Nothing more. They arrived promptly."
4,good bags for price,"These bags feel a bit thinner than the Electrolux brand bags, but I've never had any issues with them rupturing open. The only complaint I have is that the top of the bag has an awkward fit in my vacuum, so it requires a little bit of work to get it to sit right and the top of my vacuum to close, but the extra effort is worth it for the cheaper price of these bags. I'd definitely order these again when I need more bags."
5,Excellent service!,Bags arrived very quickly with quite a bit of communication from the seller. We would definitely order from this company again.
5,Just find the vacuum bags!!,"I had a 'better' vacuum in my house than I had been using. I realized all I needed were new bags for it. I shopped some, but with the price of gas--I went right to Amazon. Great!! Thanks"
2,Great features; lousy design,"I read tons of reviews on multi-handset cordless phones, and thought that maybe I could live with the negatives reported by users of this phone--I was wrong. This phone was loaded with features I wanted (including 3 additional handsets I also purchased), but that didn't overcome the fact that unless I held the phone to my ear just so, I couldn't hear the caller. And I can't tell you how many times I hung up on folks or muted them or hit the flash button unintentionally. After three weeks of trying to perform the basic function of talking on the telephone with no accidents, I returned the whole mess. I'll wait until Uniden comes out with a similar system, wait until users review it, then take the reviews more seriously. ;-)"
1,"Poor sound, volume","We got this phone because it has a small footprint and attractive form factor, even though it was one of the most ... phones at Target. But as soon as we plugged it in, it was a different story..It is hard to figure out how to dial in the first place, and when you do make a connection, the volume is very low, even if you set it on maximum. You can set it on handset speaker, and then you can hear OK, but you find you are talking AT your phone, not into it. This is bothersome. Sound quality is poor overall, with drop-outs and a slight constant white noise hiss.This phone is going back to the store!"
1,Low Volume = Low Voltage,"I agree with Stacy, if you live in a large city and have a telco that uses low volage, do not purchase this phone. I can't even get a dial tone in one room, in another room the reception is fuzzy. Went through the whole nine yards with Panasonic tech support and, it seems, there is nothing I can do about this problem."
2,It's a VTECH!,"I originally bought this Panasonic and returned it because of poor sound quality. But before I returned it, I purchased the new V-tech model available for $... at target. It had all the same features, and I was going to compare the two. They are the *exact* same phone. Same display, same menus, same rings, even the synthesized voice on the voicemail system is the same. There is a curious difference though, the V-tech has way better sound quality.Don't throw your money away on the Panasonic. But the V-tech for less and get better sound. I opened up the phone, and the components are the same. Panasonic and V-tech are probably just buying these from a 3rd party, putting custom cases on them, and reselling them. Maybe the V-tech has a better speaker and mic though, because it's much better sounding."
1,Do not buy this awful ball,"This is TERRIBLE product. I had it less than 1 month before it began to tear. It never had a round shape. It is not ""balanced""--it retained a lopsided bulge regardless of how I tried to round it out. Also, If you intend to bounce it at all, such as for plyometrics, DO NOT GET THIS BALL. Instead, get a rubberized ball, which is like a heavy basketball."
2,CHEAP LEATHER BALL,CHEAP DRY LEATHER BALL OBLONG BEYOND WHAT A MED BALL SHOULD BE EXTREMELY UNBALANCED PROBABLY AN IMITATION BASED ON THE QULITY OR LACK THEREOF OF THE EVERLAST LABEL
5,Great addition to your training,"These Everlast leather balls are good ones, sturdy and tough. There are several good books avaiible now on medicine ball training and you can search online for medicine ball workouts too. I have found that the 8-9 lbs. balls are a bit heavy for most of my female students that are new to medicine ball training. They do better with a 4-5 lbs. or 6-8 lbs ball. The 8-9 will suit most men of average strength. The 12 or the 15 lbs are about as big as you need to go for a superior workot as you progress. With these Everlast balls I carefully remove the synthetic name tag which makes for a more comfortable catching surface all the way around."
1,Cant stand the heat,"Dead in under 90 days. Tore apart at the seam. The leather is not even broken in yet. It has only been used the way a medicine ball is supposed to be used. Amazon says there is a 1 yr EVERLAST manufacturers warranty, we'll see what that means."
1,Incorrect product properties advertised,"I chose this ball because it was advertised in leather material. It is definitely NOT leather, but plastic - and smells quite strongly like plastic, too. Unfortunately, I cannot send it back, because I took it out of country. I will buy again from a company which advertised incorrectly."
1,I don't even think this is real leather,"I just bought this ball and used it twice. The second time it burst open next to one of the seams. After inspecting it, it seems as though this is actually a vinyl ball but it might be really cheap leather. I would recommend against any of the everlast products (the zipper on my heavy bag broke too). I just contacted everlast so I'm interested to see what their customer service is like."
3,Synthetic leather,"I have had this model Everlast medicine ball for several years. It is synthetic leather (vinyl) and therefore a bit slippery. Everlast does not make leather medicine balls.Now, as a medicine ball it does function."
2,Suspense plus Religious Preaching a Strange Mix,"McCourtney has a good plot and characters, but her constant interruptions with Christian messages left me confused. Is this a novel or a Christian tract? The Christian messages seemed to interrupt the flow of the story and did not fit well with a mystery novel."
1,BRUTAL,"How can you combine this type of brutality with the excessive and supposedly Christ-centered theology presented in this book? In my opinion you can't--it just doesn't work! I am extremely disappointed in this author and will never read another of Lorena McCourtney's books. The description of the viscious and inhumane way an innocent little animal was treated totally turned my stomach and took away any respect that I had for this author. What is going on with her anyway?Needless to say, I hated this book and wish that I could give it 10 black marks instead of only one star."
5,RIPTIDE,"RIPTIDE, like all of Loena McCourtney was so intertaining. They are good clean, funny in places mystery books. I have read almost all of her books and I am looking forward to any new ones that come out.."
5,"See other Lorena McCourtney reviews, she is WONDERFUL","Lorena McCourt writes:characters so real you could meet them one daysituations we might all find ourselves inthrills and chills worthy of a movieand morality and plots that uplift and cheer us up.See my other reviews on her books. She needs to be on the front shelves at every major bookstore, she is fantastic."
4,OK read,"The characters were less believable than in book one. Still, it was a decent read. I'd give it 3.5 stars if that score were available, but prefer to be generous. ;-)"
3,Ok read,"I know it's a Christian romance , but it was a little too much religion and not enough story for me."
3,Not her best offering....,"I have enjoyed quite a few of Lorena McCourtney's Kindle books -- all of the Ivy Malone series and now this, the Julesburg series. I enjoy the way she weaves a tale and inserts enough unexpected twists to keep you guessing. I also enjoy the Christian slant on all her books, with the characters' relationship with God always part of the plot.*Riptide,* however, has not been my favorite. I did not like the way the plot played out in general, and there were LOTS of editing errors that I had not noticed in other works. There were quite a few times when the characters' names were even wrong, which really threw me.I will still read the next book in this series simply because I enjoy McCourtney's style (generally), and because any author can have a rough time with a particular book. These books make for nice summer reading."
3,Covers Basics of Media Relations,The DVD is a very basic overview of media relations. Downside is the video is Rotbart giving a lecture with VAs being projected. This makes for a less than interesting visual with both lighting and the VAs. Could do a better job of holding audience interest.
3,"Crazy, zany mystery!","I believe that people who like crazy, murder mysteries will enjoy this book. If you don't like books that are sometimes quite strange this is not a book for you.Eric Poole- Eric is a psycopathic, muderer, who is now being released from a juvenile center. He soon meets a girl named Lori.Lori Cransten- Lori becomes fixated on Eric and will not leave him alone. She is a high school girls that runs away from home often. Her parents never know where she is at.Eric and Lori go on a journey to many new places. They become close friends, while evading the cops. In the end Eric has to choose what he wants more, to have his fun again or freedom.All in all I didn't really like the book. It was just too strange in some spots for me."
4,Tenderness,"Tenderness was a wonderful book. The only thing I had a problem with this book was the ending, but you'll find out about it yourself and you might disagree. It was a two-sided story, one side being a girl running away from home looking for a boy she met long ago that was just released from juvenile hall, and the boy she met who was sent to jail for the brutal murder of supposed ""abusive parents who tortured him for years"". What the cops, (all except a smart detective), don't know is that he also sexually assaulted and murdered 3 or more girls on the side. When the runaway girl sneaks into his van he realizes that she could be a threat to him and decides to try and kill her.The book is so well written, it is almost as if you are there. Eric, the murderer, is actually a very likable character. It's the girl that will get on your nerves."
3,Tenderness,"The only Robert Cormier book i have read before Tenderness was I Am the Cheese. I Am the Cheese is much more confusing, but Tenderness had the same type of writing that took a little extra thought to understand. I have never read a book like Tenderness before, i actually preferred not to, but now i will try the different books, and see how they turn out.Eric Poole is a confusing character that is only understood when we look at what Lori has to say about him. I couldn't predict how things will turn out, but it did keep me wanting more."
2,My review for Tenderness,"Tenderness, by Robert Cormier was a good book, which was really exciting to read. The beginning of the book shared the little world for Lori Cranston and her weird fixations,which can only be erased when she kisses the man she has her fixations on.Eric Poole, also a teenager murders his parents cold bloodedly. Then towards the middle of the story Cormier begins to bring the two characters together on this mysterious adventure.This twisted little novel captured my attention, and kept me reading through the book, but the ending was so surprising! It was unexpected and ubrupted. I honestly believe that Robert Cormier could have elaborated more on the ending. I really didn't understand what happened, so I had to read it over again to figure out what really happened.This novel was overall a good book, and I recommend everyone to read this little novel."
2,An Unrealistic Novel-not recommended,"Though I have read many of Cormier's books I have to say that this was my least favorite. I do give him credit for perhaps trying to envision a novel with a creative and inovative plot, but he ruins it with his characters. Lori and Eric are the two most unlikely pair to ever team up. Lori Crance contrdicts herself and is too pittiful for her ownn good. I have researched Cormier extencivley and I am aware of his belief in not trying to sugar coat his story lines. He tells it like it is. I do respect that, but as a result this novel is choppy and jumps around not really having any focus. As for Eric; Eric Poole is an unrealistic character who is completely unlovable. It seems impossible that any person could feel like Lori does about this tremendously one-dimensional indiviual. I do recommend Cormier to young adults, books like we all fall down, and fade, but this one was my least favorite."
1,"Sexist, boring, repugnant, poor characters","The poor presentation of these characters was beyond belief. The author wants us to sympathize with Eric, a smug, manipulative, unrepentant murderer. And even more impossible, he probably expected us to take Lori seriously. How? She was a brainless, laughably puerile barbie doll. Drab sentences don't compensate for such violent, sexist material. Eric murders teenage girls to perform necrophilia on their remains, and Lori uses her sexuality to get what she wants. This book is cheap in that it relies completely on meaningless, shocking ideas. Who needs real characters, plot, or dialogue if you can make people gasp? Dull, offensive and pointless. I found it on my summer reading list which is ridiculous. It isn't for young teenagers who are already anesthetized to sexism and violence."
4,Still Shocked by the conclution,A fantastic novel! It keeps you on the edge of your seat untill the twisted yet horrid ending. A must on you reading list! One of the best pieces of literature I have ever read.
3,a thrilling but strange book,"I thought this book was good, it had a very different spin to it. I like novels about murderers and suspense and that is probably way I was into the book and thought that it was good. The main character definitely was not right in the head. Because it's not normal for a person to enjoy taking somebody's life. But at the same time it's interesting to rea* his thoughts and feelings of what is going on at the same time. The girl, I think, had problems for one because she and her mom were moving around all of the time and also because she would get obsessions about this one certain person and have to do something about it. I think that her family life was also dysfunctional. Maybe that is why that she was obsessed with the killer. But I think that the book was good. You would probably only enjoy it if you like suspense and stories of murderers with a twist."
5,tenderness,"the product did take a while to get to me, but that is to be expected seeing as i live in hawaii. it was in a good condition and i was satisfied with the product that i received."
4,The Tenderness...,"This is an entertainingly dark novel. Ends in a fairly predictable, anticlimactic way, but is still great to read. I agree with another reviewer that Cormier takes a seemignly ""nice"" word and turns it into something quite nasty. For lack of a better term, the use of the words ""the tenderness"" throughout the novel... Eric is looking for ""the tenderness"" is really quite ""skeevy."" These characters are either empty or pathetic. I had to keep reminding myself that there are really people like this out there. This novel will make you shudder and feel like you need a shower afterwards, but all in a good way."
3,Venture Into the Mind of a Psychopath,"Robert Cormier is one of the most renowned authors of young adult literature, yet this one falls short of his signature plot twists. The characters, convicted killer Eric Poole and the runaway teen who fantasizes about him, Lori Cranston, are realistic enough - especially in a society that has watched thousands of women lustfully throw themselves at murderer Scott Peterson. While this is a page-turner that will strike an emotional, obsessive chord with young adults, I believe they will be as disappointed as I was with the conclusion of this work. Cormier knew his audience better than this particular novel suggests and it cannot possibly compare with his others (I Am The Cheese; After The First Death).If this is the first of Cormier's books that you've tried, please don't allow it to cloud your judgment of his writing. Give the aforementioned titles a try - they are definitely worth your time and guaranteed a re-read."
1,Worst Cormier Book Ever,"I like most of Cormier's work, but this one was awful. The characters are dull, the plot is predictable... it lacks the twists and turns of Cormier's other books. I wouldn't even leave this one behind in the coffee shop because I didn't want anyone else to have to read it!"
3,The subject in this novel is too mature for young readers.,"I personally enjoyed this book. It is well written and has excellent characters. It is not, however, a novel for readers under the age of 16. Parents, please beware. This is an adult novel with young adult characters."
5,Wow,"I'm usually not one to like young adult fictions, but I was blown away with this one. It was very deep and emotional; this is one of the few books that have made me feel crushed and hurt about what had happened. The way the killer slowly falls in love with her, only to lose her in the end was touching and beautiful. Just hopeing RC doesn't come out with anymore low level reading books without much need for a comprehension."
3,"Very good, but the reading level could have higher.","I rated Tenderness as 3 stars because I felt it had a lot of potential that was never expressed, but was generally a good story with a lot of feeling behind it. Most of the characters as easy to identify with. The main character in the story is a girl, Lori, who has ongoing obsessions with somewhat infamous characters such as a rock star and a teenage killer. Tenderness also focuses on the teenage killer, named Eric Poole as his morbid thoughts while in prison, and out of prison. Through these situations this book presents itself with a lot of emotion to to express what ever character is feeling. I would recommend this book to young adults."
3,a little lacking,"This is the first Robert Cormier book I've read. I was intrigued by the synopsis, ""damaged youth"" type books are my weakness. However, I couldn't really get into this one, even though I finished it in only a few hours. It kept me turning pages, but it never pulled me in. Something about the story and the way it was told kept me at a distance. The narrative was matter-of-fact, with some scenes between Eric and the Lieutenant comprised only of big blocks of dialog and nothing else. I never connected with Eric, who acted like a much older man and not an 18-year-old, or Lori, who was 15 but acted like a well-seasoned hooker. There was never a chance to really delve into who these characters are. I basically know that Eric has ""Charm"" and Lori has a huge set of knockers. We are reminded of these facts on almost every page. I appreciated the idea of the story but it could have been so much more!"
5,No problems,"I've never had an issue. Though I'm just an average person with a camera, this disk has enough space for all my pictures from trips, gatherings, work projects, documentation, etc. I don't keep all my photos on the camera or disk, since I transfer them to other files on a hard drive, but it's never been a problem taking and keeping pictures until they are filed. I've had hundreds of pictures on the disk at a time."
3,Beware of Blue Proton,"I've been interested in buying this item, which I'm sure is of good quality, but I wanted to ask the seller, Blue Proton, some questions about shipping, since I wanted to buy 8 of them. I sent them 3 emails, and they never responded to any of them. I think I'll choose to buy from a more professional and reliable company."
1,Didn't Work,"I purchased this just in time to get it in the mail before leaving for a month long trip to Africa. I kept my 256mb card just in case. I took a few pictures on this card I purchased, and decided to transfer them to my computer to edit them. After transferring them, I put the card back in my camera, and it wouldn't work anymore. My camera said that the card was not activated. I put it back in my computer, and it wouldn't read it.So, I had to transfer pictures much more than I wanted during the trip, because the 1gb card I purchased simply didn't work. I was very disappointed."
2,Misleading picture,While the picture shows two cards and it is called a retail package - you will only get one card. Product works fine though.
3,speed,"my camera was old model, so it couldnt handle the 1 GB capactiy of memory.so i returned back the memory card back."
2,Not Worth The Money,"While this product does heat up as advertised, the fact that only the very tip does so makes it inadequate for my purposes at least. I have lousy circulation and wanted the socks for overall foot warmth at night."
2,Good socks....wrong usage,The electrically heated socks simply did not work in an indoor setting. My daughter's feet were always cold after her course of chemotherapy. I had hoped that the socks would keep her feet warm. She tells me they did not work.
3,Not so heated,"At first i couldn't make them work.I installed the batteries exactly as described in the manual but nothing happened.Then i put a small wire in the bottom and it worked.BUT not everything is heated.Only the area under the fingers.And because of that it isn't very comfortable.Still they are working and keeping you warm.Not hot,warm."
2,battery heated socks,I can only say if all battery socks work the way the one that I had there probly wouldn't be many sold. The battery got warmer than the toe of the sock to the touch.
1,Overrated,"I'm not sure why this is ranked 4 stars, I bought and was instantly disappointed. Music, so-so, but's okay because I was mostly interested in the video, which looked like something I could have made (not impressive). In the end, I should have just purchased Ocean Origins (2002) on IMAX.... it's a way better mind trip and the video footage is superior."
2,Not what is described,"This CD is childish. No sophistication, a total disappointment. Don't bother! You can make this yourself!"
3,mixed bag,"this is basically two packages:-lots of old cliche visuals done to generic hippytronica and whatever, forgettable-new stunning generative visuals to deep exquisite audio, and chat about the project, super great, top marksput together in a powerpoint-looking dvd menucould seriously just lose all the old stuff, adds zero. more of the magic sheep stuff: and hooray for the author's transientness-of-competitive-things conceptualizing, but blah blah, just render these things every few weeks and make DVD compilations and I'll buy them."
4,College Accounting by McQuaig et al.,"The work is a complete rendition in applied accounting. It isgeared for the average college student. This version isbest-suited for a two-term or 6 credit course in accountingor an accounting with lab course. There is good treatmentof the fundamental rules of accounting with ample examplesand homework problems. The work is scarce on theory.Therefore, the instructor should supplement this version of thebook with a textbook for majors in accounting. In addition,the author publishes a smaller text with fewer chapters.This text is heavy and a bit unwieldy to carry to class.The upper echelon of the class did very well with this text.In fact, the class average was a ""B"" over 8+ sections ofmy students. If your class roster is very large, I wouldconsider segmenting the class into advanced placement,mid-quartile and lower-quartile students. It is toughto cover this text in a single semester while teachingmarginal and advanced students in the same class."
4,One of the best philosophical books I've read,"This books offers the unique approach of taking a peek to still up to date social behaviors and trends from a western christian and an oriental budist point of view.Even though the book was written during the cold war years, much of its content still remains current as well as most of the issues it exposes. Helps to clear up many things with a refreshing approach as well as renew some hope to possible fixes to the most common human problems"
3,They've done better but it's not bad,This one's a little too slow and plodding at times.Bjornstad and Rypdal made a great live album that used some of the material from this one and others.I still listen to it but it's not my favorite.If you just have to have more Bjornstad or Rypdal then I think you'll be somewhat pleased. But I wouldn't knock over the furniture trying to get to the CD.
2,Boring. Uninspired.,"There's a lot of sleepy-time music out there these days. Tranquil music that usually succeeds best with elegant simplicity. This, like the others in this series of water music, falls short of any appearant musical goals. There is little to distinguish Bjornstad's compositions, some of which are trite at best. The only salvation is the relief of tedium provided by Terje Rypdal and the marvelous sound of David Darling's cello."
2,Disappointment,"Bjornstad and Darling created absolute magic in ""The River"". The two work in such incredible harmony. In ""The Sea"", the addition of the drum and Guitar is shameful. The soulful magic that the piano and cello create is totally disrupted by an infantile ""pay attention to me too"" drum beat that simply does not belong and even sounds out of sync. The guitar simply perverts the beauty of Darling and Bjornstad! Edit out the guitar and drums and in my opinion you have a masterpiece. Go buy ""The River"" instead."
4,look nice...a little hard to put up,"I love the way these lights look but they are somewhat cumbersome to put up. Also, this is our second set because they start going out in sections and eventually do not work at all. Wish they were more dependable."
4,Blood Brothers,The seller rushed my order to me. I would buy from this seller again.The DVD was a good movie it would of been beter if I didn't have to read the whole movie.
5,The Meaning of Property Right Economics,"This book, unlike many other books on new institutional economics, constructed some scientific theories on property right economics. It should be a suitable basis of learning scientific new insitutional economics. Once you have read this book, you will know the correct meaning of economics of property rights."
4,watch case,"I thought this was a great Christmas idea, but the recipient did not, so it was returned without difficulty."
1,1 stick,"I thought I was receiving multiple glow sticks, I received ONE. Maybe I misread what I ordered, but I wasn't happy with just ONE."
1,NOT HAPPY,"From the title ( Coghlans - LIGHTSTICKS-BULK-GREEN (9200)) you would think you are getting a bulk amount of glowstick(s). However, what is not told is that you are only buying one glowstick for the price amount. If I would have known ahead of time that I would only be getting one I would have never got this in the first place. They shipped me a pretty good sized box with one glowstick in it, mind you this box could have fit about 20 or so glowsticks."
3,"Good reading, but not what I expected","I really enjoyed the book. But because of it's technical aspect about the scientific viewpoint of time travel, I did get bogged down. But it didn't really give me any practical techniques or lessons/examples to follow to try it on my own. I had to be a part of a group, and that doesn't appeal to me."
1,A good idea that failed,"This book is seriously flawed & inaccurate. A Mesoamerican Calendar Round is NOT 52 of ""our"" years, it's 52 Haab cycles. As a resource to find out what tzolkin date matches to a modern date, it is useless.Her ideas on tones & glyphs are interesting; if you buy the book buy it for that only."
1,Calendar Misunderstanding,"This book is full of misunderstandings of the Maya calendar. None of the dates match up with any of the on-line computer systems or any of the respectible scholarlly work: i.e. J. Eic S. Thompson, Floyd Lounsburg, Dennis Tedlock, Linda Schele, David Freidel, Anthony Aveni, Edward Titch, Hans Hurtung, Barbara Tedlock. Don't buy it if you want to know your true birthday. You can find that out in ""Time and the Highland Maya,"" or on line."
2,Great Features don't outweigh the poor reception and sound,"If the sound and reception were up to par, this would be a great system. I wish I had read some of the reviews before purchasing. I'm just returning this and two handsets today. The features are wonderful, though lacking a few things that could be helpful- a screen on the base unit that imitates the handset disply (the base handset display doesn't track with what's happening on the base unit) and a voice mail button that will dial direct to my service as on another Panasonic that I own.I'm going to wait, though, until the sound and the reception catches up to the features. The background noise was unacceptable and the range was not great. The intercom feature was good, but not the principal reason I bought the phone."
2,Hmmmm....,i bought this phone and was disappointed. if you tuck the phone under your chin to talk it hangs up....i eventually exchanged this for the 1050 series because it comes with an extra battery storage/charge drawer which is great when the power goes out!
1,Elisa's review,This is the worst phone I have ever used. I cannot walk into another room without losing the person I'm talking to. The expandable phones are even worse.
1,lovelyrita,"Terrible phone. In addition to the problem of inadvertent hangups and muting, the phone has never allowed me to retrieve messages remotely. I tried to exchange it, but couldn't, since it was past the 30 day mark. Avoid this product!"
2,Poorly designed phone,"As others have stated, the sound quality is poor. In addition, the sound level is low; the volume can't be turned up enough to overcome any amount of background noise. The worst part: the mute, hold, and off buttons are located so they are easy to bump with your cheekbone. My wife can't use this phone for 30 minutes without hanging up on someone. Guess I'll be shopping for new phones again."
3,"Good phone, bad ergonomics","Everything works really well on this phone - great sound, handsfree feature is fantastic, good range, second unit works well, easy to program. Loses two stars because the off and mute buttons are poorly positioned. If you tuck the phone under your chin you hang up the call. Happens often. Really annoying and easily avoidable design flaw. All things being equal buy a different phone."
2,"Too small to be ""dressable""","The proportions of the fasteners of this doll's clothing are too small for a child learning how to dress dolls. This doll needed at least 5 more inches in height and 3-4 inches in width to be categorized as dressable. As she is now, she's hugable for a 1-2 year old child."
3,Cute...,"It is a cute little doll, but I liked it more than my daughter. She was scared of it. :o) We are hoping that she warms up to it when she gets a little older. For now it is on a shelf in her closet."
5,The proof is in the pudding.,"Like little Mikey, I tried it. I liked it. But more important than that, my son liked it. His reading improved rapidly as he learned the spelling patterns. He liked the fact that he was getting to spell words that were even outside his vocabulary! He had no idea what flatter meant the first time he encountered the word. But he correctly spelled it the very first time. And, of course, he handled flattery as easily as he had battery. All that just starting with the word AT in the first lesson and building on it to BAT, RAT, and BRAT. Then going to the ATS words as in BATS, RATS, BRATS, FLATS, and then to the ATTED AND ATTING words as in batted and batting, and then to the ATTER and ATTERY words as in BATTERY and FLATTERY. I can't believe that this book isn't better known in our schools."
3,Good hat for a good price,"I bought this for my 4.5 year old who has a larger-sized head. Toddler hats do not fit him anymore, so I wanted to get a bigger hat he could grow into. Though it is quite large on his head, it still looks really cute, though I would not bank on it not flying off with a gust of wind. It seems to be constructed solidly, though I assume the fabric will fade over time. The inseam of the hat flipped out easily and needs to be tucked back in from time to time, probably due to it being too large. I bought one in a smaller size and different color (a tan color) and like that one as well."
3,OK - but dangerous,"The charm is very nice, however, it doesn't come apart good. When you separate it, it leaves sharp pieces that could puncture your skin or tear a delicate blouse. It should come already separated with edges already smooth. You shouldn't have to figure out a way to have to smooth sharp edges."
2,Cheap (in quality),"This charm is much smaller then you would think. And it seemed flimsy. I was worried it would tear apart the wrong way when I had to manually separate the two pieces. Also, as a non-jewelery person, I did not realize it does not come with chains. For men out there like me please note, ""charm"" mean ""pay a lot AND buy a chain to go along with item""."
4,Grandaughter is happy,"I bought these for my Grandaughter's 9th birthday. She is very happy with them and her mom said they work really well. Good sound, easy to use and good range. So from what they have said, I am happy with this product and bought it strictly from all the previous reviews."
5,GREAT! Best I found. Don;t hesitate - get these!,"These are great! They work great - distance, clarity, ease of use (7 & 4 year olds were suing them within minutes). if you;re not sure which to get - get these - I am extremely happy with them!"
3,cute,"the kids loved it. $60+ shipping. however it worked too good. we were constantly on ""play with parental supervision mode"". lost one somewhere...bought another set that isn't so perfect. kids are still happy to chat. only $35 in store purchase. much better."
1,Failed,This was a Christmas present for my 2 young grand daughters who are sisters. One worked the other did not and is in the process of being returned.
1,Didn't work,I ordered these for my daughters 5th birthday. Right out of the box after unwrapping them one of the walkie talkies didn't work. I took me 2 weeks to get them sent back. It was the only thing my daughter really wanted for her birthday and it was a big diappointment.
4,Rollickin' good times from Armadillo World Headquarters!,"I wish I had been there! Commander Cody is the piano-thumper and croaks an occasional ""novelty"" song, but he is surrounded by top-notch honky-tonkers. Billy C. Farlow, lead vocals and guitar, is at the top of his form. Bobby ""Blue"" Black is one of the great unsing pedal-steel players. Frankly, I can't decide whether these guys are SERIOUS, or if they are doing a good-natured PARODY of the honky-tonk thing! But regardless, they sure know what they are doing. Tight stuff! (If you get a chance, give a listen to ""Hot Licks, Cold Steel, and Truckers Favorites,"" a recording I don't believe is available on CD.) I still cry every time I listen to the ""Down To Seeds And Stems Again Blues""! Throw this disc on the player when you need your spirits lifted, or when the party is draggin'!"
5,Wish I had been there!,"The Commander and the boys put on a hell of a show.Cody does his ""talking songs"" just right with the band doing great ""effects""--like the car fender clicking the guard rail on ""Hot Rod Lincoln"".Bill Kirchen is a great guitar player--love the sounds he gets outta that ol' Telly.Billy C. sounds great too.Buffalo Bruce and Lance-- what a rhythm section!John Tichy provides great rhythm guitar (and has a Ph.D. in engineering!).Can't forget Andy Stein on the fiddle and saxophone.Last but not least, Bobby ""Blue"" Black plays super pedal steel.A great fun album from begining to end!!!"
5,A must read for every Christians,"This book covers the Great Commission for every Christian (Go Preach, cast out demons, heal the sick, baptism of the Holy Ghost, ...) The book has supporting testimony and verses. I read this book after I attend Brother Carlos crusade, and find it true. It is a must read for every Christians."
2,Big Brand Name Mediocre VCR Playback,"I'm very proficient with electronics and even I had problems reading through the instruction manual I gave up after 2-3 minutes and hooked it up without it. It was easy enough. This DVD/VCR combo has every feature you could want including 5x search forward & backward, this was great especially with the DVDs. There are two disappointing facts however: the lighted remote only lights 8 keys NOT including numbers, volume or channel keys. Also the VCR picture quality was miserable in comparison to the Phillips DVD/VCR (but the Phillips ate my VCR tape, I didn't try another). This was very disappointing coming from Panasonic but I've experienced poor picture quality with their VCR PV-8664 as well. so much so I'm returning it this eve. I paid ... at PC Richards here in NY over priced due to poor picture quality, poor manual, and only eight keys lighting on the remote, but you've gotta love the features (though not enough to keep it)."
4,Solid Performer,Basic set up to replace an existing vcr is simple and straight forward. Manual is extensive and could be inproved but info is all there. Unit seems very well made. Performance and controls are very good. The Panasonic CT-27D11 might be a good match to get the most out of this unit.
4,Good choice if limited on space,The item has performed very well. Needed something to play VHS and DVD for the kids and I only had limited space. The machine is easy to use and the front A/V inputs make it easy to hook up a video camera to watch home movies.all in all we are very satisfied.
3,CHECK TYPE!!!,It wasn't the right book type. You NEED to be careful to what you are selling because some people are looking for a certain version!
3,loops away,"a remix of tracks from the Romic Cube album. some interesting involvement here from Trans Am and Portastatic (whose remixes are most distinct and take the original to a new level). and the usual suspects...Buffalo Daughter, Dj You Dj Me. there are not too many surprises here...if you liked the Roomic Cube album, you'll find some small comforts here in these sonic re-workings."
1,Who Requested This Album?,"Was there a huge public outcry for a ""recubing"" of of Roomic Cube? This chit sounds like the soundtrack to explosive diarrhea. The type you find on occasion in porta-toilets in national parks.If I could I would slap the cute off this broad for tricking me into listening to the remix of 1.66666666666666666666666666666666666. I liked the original version. This mickey mouse garbage is going to get someone hate mailed. Word."
1,Hard to keep lit and very hard to clean,"Got this as a gift. Getting the burner started was hard as the wire mesh wasn't all the way down on the bottom, and it's still not easy and usually requires a number of retries. Once lit, the fuel capacity is way too small - when you have a meat fondue, you have to refill about three times while you're eating. Cleaning out the remains of a cheese fondue is extremely hard, takes at least 15 minutes. It may be anodized, but it sure is not non-stick. The stand and burner started rusting, after four months."
3,A worthy testimonial for a skilled Healer.,This is more a testimonial to the Tibetan Qigong of Master Zi Sheng Wang than a narrative or biography. If one is considering studying Qigong or seeking relief from a health complication it would be wise to read this book and decide for ones self.
1,Chinese Massage - Hands' Massage,Although there is a subscript -- I had no idea that narrator did not speak English -- I would not have purchased this product had I realized this was the case. Disappointing!
5,Classic Ska Singles,"Except for AWFUL version of Maggie's Farm, this is a must have for Specials fans. Traces arc of early singles thru Nelson Mandela and Ghost Town 12"" mixes. Hard to believe they were around for such a short time."
5,A Great Introduction ....,"...to one of the best bands of all time.I do suggest buying any Specials record / CD because they ARE that good. But this is certainly the one youll want to keep on hand. The Singles Collection was the first batch of Specials songs I ever owned. And it is great for a new Specials fan or a long time fan. This CD contains the basics and while the basics may not be enough for the snobby, know-it-all fans, it is still well worth buying. Its fun, real and some of the best Ska this planet has ever heard. Its a CD youll keep close. I promise. 5 big stars!Matter of fact- I think Ill buy another copy of this myself."
4,A little Specials goes a long way,"I like ska, but I don't LOVE Ska. This Cd does it for me. My only beef is that they could have packed a few more tracks onto it.Now then... Unless you're seriously into ska, punk or jamaican music in general- this is probably all The Specials you'll ever need. This album is more conclusive than either the Specials (best of) CD or the More Specials (best of 2) Cd. Stylistically, it covers all the bases including several hard to fing cuts (most notably Ghost town, a sweet creepy little tune with an arabian sound to it- well used in Guy Ritchie's 'Snatch'... or maybe it was 'Lock, Stock...').At any rate, this is all prime-rate, good stuff. If you are looking for a place to begin delving into ska, or simply trying to round out a decent CD collection- you could do far worse. No, actually, I'm pretty sure it was 'Snatch,' afterall."
3,Catching up with Tony Joe,"I bought this after hearing his live version of John Lee Hooker, ""Boom Boom"", on WWOZ out of New Orleans. I had not kept up with Tony Joe since ""Poke Salad Annie"" release in the early '70's and while Boom Boom is very good the rest of the offerings are so-so. I guess that is why he has played mostly in Europe all these years."
1,CAUTION DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM,"THIS IS SMALLER THAN REGULAR LAPTOP COMPUTERS AND DONT HAVE USB PORTS AND CARD READER EITHER, AS ADVERTISED.I RATED THIS 1 BECAUSE THERE IS NO 0"
4,brush curling iron,"I had a hard time finding a brush curling iron when the teeth on my old one kept breaking. I looked everywhere. I finally found this one on Amazon and was saved. I could have purchased 3 in a pack but was not sure so I only bought the one iron. I really like my curling iron and am considering purchasing the 3 in a pack so that I will have them for the future in case the original one breaks (which I doubt will happen). Thank you Amazon for having items that most other retailers do not have.The curling iron was the Salon Edition Mini 1/2"" Professional Brush Iron."
4,1/2 inch brush curling iron,This curling iron seems to work really good. I would recommend it. It works really good for short hair.
1,Defective Product From the Start!,"How disappointing! The product review on the 1/2"" brush iron was just what I have been looking for--only to open the box and have one of the combs off the heating unit fall out of the box into my lap! I also plugged in the brush just to see if it heated OK and the brush never got hot enough that I couldn't touch it.Now I'm looking for another company to purchase a 1/2"" brush iron from and only hope that my luck is better this time!Redwolf"
2,"well written, but a downer","i recently read nectar in a sieve for a class project. im a sophmore in highschool, and it might seem typical of my age to make this comment, but i found the book depressing. true as it may be, certain aspects of the book didnt hold my interest. if you're in highschool, i dont reccomend this book. as part of a Gt ( gifted and talented ( advanced) class, it was still a little over my head."
2,southwestern bell = unreliable electronics,"we had the GH2410C, which is very similar to this model, and it was awful. the volume was terrible- i could barely hear anyone talking, and when you pick up the phone, it takes 1 - 2 seconds before you can begin conversing. awful, awful phone. my toddler just doused ours in water so we have to replace it, which i can't say i'm sorry for."
3,"okay, but not sufficient","My four-year-old daughter loves Madeline, and she has all 6 Madeline characters available in the 8"" doll line. I bought this doll case because it was meant to hold the 8"" dolls and their accessories. Inside the case (which looks like the ""old house in Paris that was covered with vines) there is a hangar bar on one side for hanging the little outfits, and satin ribbons on the other side for tying the dolls in place so they don't bounce around. Both sides have a drawer for little stuff such as their shoes, gloves and hats. It is great if you only have the Madeline doll and a few outfits, but this case quickly becomes insufficient when you add her friends to the collection. And when my daughter got the Ms. Clavel doll, we discovered that she doesn't fit in the case at all - she's too tall! Needless to say, making everything fit into the case became such a chore, that the dolls don't get put away very often."
5,It was a Christmas gift,Our sons works for John Deere and just bought a new truck. It was a perfect Christmas gift for him!
3,large?! NOT!,"Definitely red; yes, it's even cute. But it is far from large; I would describe it as small. Pay attention to the dimentions."
5,Read this book!! Timely help for needed encouragement for turning out good workers.,"This book has been a tremendous blessing to our family and an encouragement for each one of us to work harder and with more joy in the task. I highly recommend it for the whole family!! We have somewhere lost the motivation to work-that being, bringing glory to God, taking care of what He has given us and knowing that a job worth doing is worth doing well. The author uses every day simple stories to bring forth some long needed truths to the areas of work. The author dispels many of today's common thinking patterns concerning work, such as laziness, slothfulness, greediness and half-heartedness. Instead he motivates us to reach for the greater good of a job well done. I highly recommend this book to families who wish to encourage their children (and themselves) to what the true purposes of work are."
5,sneakers,"Gave Sneakers, the Seaside Cat for a donation to a children's library. They were so excited about this book. The illustrations were awesome!"
5,Worth Its Weight in Gold to a Local Advertiser,"""Adman?"" Seriously??I beg to disagree with his astonishing (mis-)characterization of Williams' presentation. Having shared both the VHS and later DVD versions of Roy's ""12 Most Common Mistakes in Advertising"" with scores of local advertisers over the last decade, I've never had anyone walk away unimpressed. On those occasions when I've urged someone to purchase the DVD, it's always been with an offer to buy it back if the individual didn't think it was worthwhile. I've never been asked to do so.Not even once.In the space of 40 minutes, Roy Williams succinctly identifies and debunks twelve of the most common misconceptions and/or faulty practices in the area of local advertising, the understanding of which cannot but help the small business owner/operator to avoid making costly mistakes.Knowledge, they say, is power. If you buy advertising for your local business, don't hesitate to avail yourself of the knowledge of this advertising genius."
1,Man with a PowerPoint and crap content,"If you are thinking of buying this, I'll give you mine for free. It's simply awful. Unless you enjoy watching a guy with a PowerPoint and not a single example other than some crap local ads he has written, save your money and time. It's really awful on every level; content, videography... just awful!"
1,Unavailable,"this book was unavailable, even though it was listed on the website, and was not shipped to me. I am surprised that Amazon is asking for a review."
3,Easy Stuff Husky,My 10 yo grandaughter loved it! Needed to have second for the other grandaughter. Smaller than I thought would be.
4,pretty good,this game is pretty good. it is now a bargain bin title so if your at eb or gamestop and your getting something this is only 4 bucks now so just pick it up along with anything else. this is a very good game. i cant say much for graphics but if youve got a friend you can put on bots and just play for hours creating your own unique maps. its a great game that even today is better than some other shooters.so if you dont have it its a good buy. i like it a little better than future perfect because it struck me as an old school clasic game. no storyline not to deep just months and months of value and exitement when your feeling bored.
4,ultra rare indeed,"Driving the night away was the big hit a great song, But Whiskey and wine has one of the fattest guitar riffs this side of Walk this way(this song is hard to find) .Popular during the early days of punk these guys just plain rocked.Oh I'm not suppose to mention the PRICE!"
5,His best yet!,"Lars Din is at his strongest with this offering. I listen to it every day... it's great for working out, to chill out in the car, or even late-night. ""Know Where You Are"" proudly takes its place among the rockin' classics! Order today"
1,Terrible,"The worst thing I have ever ordered from Amazon, stop working after 3 months. So I can't even return it. Throw it away is the only choice."
1,Quality is bad,The sound quality on this phone is really awful. The people I called couldn't hear me and I could hear the person I called as if they were calling from a can with string attached.
3,A lovely reference...but...,"The excitement of having a plethora of pictures of each annual and perennial is accomplished with this book. The photos are lovely. However, had the contents been organized in a longer setting(12X14) and more user-friendly reference of the plants, I would have been more forgiving in this review. The book is too small (5x8)and too compact for the enjoyment of looking for the perfect plant(s). The common names are not included and this makes for a need for ordinary identification.Kudos to the photographers."
2,Fair Reference - not the best,"I bought both Annuals & Perennials, and Trees & Shrubs for considerable price and found them both lacking in listings and information. Some commonly grown plants that are excluded from this collection include: daffodils, artichokes, tulips, bamboos, chamomile, crocosmia, crocus, ostritch fern, cinimmon fern, and on, and on. I was hoping to use the books to correlate Zone information between Sunset Western Garden's system and the USDA Zone system, however, many plants that ARE listed in the Sunset book are NOT listed in the Botanica books. I'd highly recommend the Sunset Western Garden book over these two photo albums provided by Botanica. Whether you garden in the Western U.S. or not."
2,"great look, quality unlike a Hunter","I have never had to balance a Hunter ceiling fan until I bought this one, the first out of over twenty purchased. The flourescent light is extremely dim at its brightest setting, a little brighter than a night light, definitely not suitable for reading. If this was my first experience with a Hunter brand product, I would try another manufacturer. The design is a compliment to the room decor, the only reason I am keeping it. If you do not like the look, avoid this product."
3,"Good, but not what I was looking for","I was looking for a true tutorial--hold my hand, step-by-step, from beginning skills to advanced skills. This book is not that. It is good, but it assumes that you already kind of know the basics of PageMaker. The first lesson has you make a flyer, but it just says ""do this"" ""do this"". Maybe what I need is a manual!"
2,Did anyone test the lessons?,"I have found portions of this book useful. I am very disappointed with the lesson files. Several chapters will not allow you to use the Word files in the lesson folders due to error ""Filter not Found"" Did anyone test these lessons after publication? I would like either my money back or corrected lesson files to complete the book."
4,HO ARMY CABOOSE,"I and my 14 year old son really liked this caboose,price, shipping, but we had to take the couplers off and move them because the wheels would not turn very good where they were located.That didn't take very long so overall I would say it was still an excellent buy. It shipped very quickly."
4,Irwin Forstner Bit Extension,"Works as advertised, well made, bits fit very well in it. My only issue is that the two set screws are too long - they stick out farther than the OD of the extension and drag on the side of the new hole being drilled. I will buy shorter set screws at my local hardware store to replace them."
1,Beware of non HP toners!,"I was in a hurry and the ""real"" HP toners wouldn't ship on time so I thought I'd try a replacement toner. BIG MISTAKE! My printer has been malfunctioning ever since. It cost me a service call from a repair person to determine that this toner was the source of my problems. So the little bit I saved in money and quick delivery cost me in the long run with a service call charge, having to toss this toner and replace it with theHP Toner for the LJ4600 (Yellow), not to mention the lost time. Our business was brought to a stand-still over the malfunctions. Don't make the same mistake!"
2,say what you want,"but these are depressing to watchseriously, what is the ONLY reason to buy a workout vid? Its the motivationI like P90X and insanity is fun, but this is so boring and depressing it makes me NOT wanna workoutnot only like watching this, but tony is starting to look like an old man, another blow. Makes me realize that i may work my butt off but still look like crap when i hit a certain ageanyone can just go to the gym and do random workouts, but they need motivation. P90X and insanity does this. One-on-one does noti'm so happy i didnt buy this cuz i definately would have been pissed to pay for something i'm not going to usetry ""insanity: asylum"" if you wanna have funcheers :o)"
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I am a P90x graduate (2nd round) and bought this product to add variety to my current program. I bought the full deck (13 DVDs) and while the workouts are good, each DVD is about 25 minutes of workout with large gaps between each set totaling about 25 minutes of talking about absolutely nothing. Tony Horton needs to quit talking about himself and focus on the workout - returning the product today."
1,Sucks.,"Do not waste your hard earned money. This is a depressing series of videos to watch and even attempt to workout through. Terrible music, long pauses through sets. I realize this was made as Tony H. was coming up for new P90X2 moves but this was an embarrassment to beachbody products. Might as well made have been made in black and white."
2,Full of location inaccuracies,"Whoever wrote the Chicago edition either is map impaired or does not live in the area. They also are west suburban phobic. All the stores, bakeries etc. that are directly west of the city are listed under south suburban. By omitting a west suburban chapter, this book is less appealing to people who live in that area.Last time I looked, Evanston was in Cook county. The editors place it sometimes in Lake County, sometimes in Cook.I recently discovered that while the information gatherers are from Chicago, the book was mapped into locations in LA. Hence the inaccuracies. It is an excuse, but one from which many lessons should be learned. Don't always count on those computer maps. It is not like looking at the atlas yourself.Hopefully, in a later edition these errors will be corrected."
5,Mastering Diversity,"I used this book for Murray State University GUI625. This book covers different diversity and discrimination issues. It has tips and suggestions for employers or managers, along with tear-out sheets in the back. I personally didn't enjoy this book much, but it was the class text. I didn't like that it was geared toward employers, not toward professionals or students. But that was a personal opinion...good for college course or for managers or supervisors."
2,"Fast Shipping, Poor Description","The book I ordered arrived very quickly, and I was pleased about that. However, it was advertised as being in ""good"" condition, and when it arrived, it was in more like ""fair"" or even ""poor"" condition. It was way too high of a price for the condition of the book, that was for sure!"
3,"A must-have mount, that is a bit fragile","This mount works on Sennheiser EK 100 portable diversity receivers. It allows you to attach it to any camera hot shoe device, or dual mount if you're using two mics. Normally, it works fine. It has a wire bail that attaches it to the receiver, giving it a little play so that it has a little ""give"" if you bump it in the process. The entire mounting plate is plastic. The hot shoe mount is plastic with a brass insert. We are very careful with our equipment for the most part, but this part broke after about six months. The weak area is the square plate (it is plastic) that slides into the actual hot shoe on your camera. This broke in half on our mount, so I've ordered another one. I don't know when it broke, I pulled it out of its padded bag the other day and found it was broken. The rest of the mount seems durable enough, but it is my opinion that Sennheiser needs to make the tongue that goes into the hot shoe out of metal instead of plastic."
5,Excellent product,My 93 yr. old mother is so pleased with this personal aid device.It helps her get out of bed with ease. She loves it.
3,stylish stories,"The stories in Pindeldyboz 2 are generally long on style and short on... Well, they are long on style. For instance, there is a noir take on bicycle messengering and a surreal approach to death through a whale. I enjoyed the stylishness although I was a bit too concious of it. I felt like someone was winking at me. ""Get it, get it?"" Otherwise the stories were a bit thin, but hey, it is really hard to write something really good, and these are fun. Enjoy them"
1,Don't judge a book by its cover!,"I bought this thing because of the appealing cover art, but I should have listened to the old saying. This is the worst selection of stories I've ever read. At their best these stories are twee and at their worst they're unforgivable."
1,YUCK.,"Really lost me on this one. I thought the other book put out was bad, but this one is reallllllllllly bad."
5,Track Listing,1. Hasta Que Amanezca2. Nuevo Sol3. Quiero Dormir Cansado4. Traicionera5. Numero Siete6. Llamarada7. Buenos Dias Señor Sol8. Sufriendo Penas9. Quiero Bailar10. Luz de Luna
2,it was good while it lasted.............,"bought this tv about a year ago and really liked it til this past week when the dvd player quit working in the middle of a movie and the picture tube started to go...as it turns out, the dvd drive warranty *just* ran out...so it'll cost about as much to fix the thing as it did to purchase it. is this what i can expect from toshiba?"
3,"Great picture, bad ergonomics","I picked this TV up the other day, it looked great and worked well. However the remote control is very badly laid out. For instance you will never find the volume control in the dark unless you memorize exactly how many buttons down and over it is. Also there is no mute control. There is no SVideo in. Worst of all for me was that out of the three universal remotes I tried for it none would work. I returned the TV the day after I purchased it."
2,Picture quality is good,I bought this TV for my bedroom and I have to say that picture quality is pretty good screen being flat also helps. However I'm really disappointed with Toshiba that they don't include Close Caption with DVD. You do not have close caption when watching DVD but you do when watching TV. You do have option of subtitle but how many DVD come with english subtitles(not many)?? I'm really disapponited with Toshiba because they advertise it as have Closed Caption but they do not. Also this DVD player does not have option of playing mp3s which most dvd player have these days. So overall picture quality is good but feature that comes with the dvd player is disappointing.
2,A good choice-- IF . . .,"The video quality is fine; the flat screen is appealing; and the styling is certainly handsome and contemporary. The remote control is another story. The layout of the keypad is counter-intuitive--tiny buttons arranged haphazardly around the keypad. . Unlike many other brands and models, this remote lacks ""Mute"" and ""Closed Caption"" functions and requires aim be dead-on or the set will not respond. Worse, in the system I purchased, the remote gradually became almost totally unresponsive, and the authorized service center could neither repair it nor secure a replacement from Toshiba. Six different ""universal"" remotes failed to work with the set because the codes were incompatible. After five weeks, Toshiba customer support still politely maintains that replacements are unavailable, and no knows when they will.And so--IF you like the design of the remote, and IF something doesn't malfunction requiring customer support, this is a very good choice."
4,Darkness Visible,"This book is not as bad as the negative reviews here suggest, but this is not Ward Just at his best, either. Worth reading? Absolutely, if you are interested in the psychology of the Cold War. That's what this novel is about. The portrait of Bill North Sr. is beautifully drawn & that is what Just is really interested in here -- a diplomat in extremis -- but the depiction of North's son Bill Jr. is much more problematic. Perhaps all terrorist acts are without motive, but the son's pathological detachment remains unexplained. As I savor the aferglow of the novel, I would note that the figure who sticks with me is Ambassador North's wife, a painter married to a diplomat, a woman who will not be bullied.If you have not read any of Just's novels, you might want to begin with A Dangerous Friend, which is about the early days of Vietnam & which is more successful, I think, in blending psychology & politics."
1,Awful.,"Just, usually so talented, wastes himself on this effort. It starts bad and stays that way. It is a real shame, though his other attempts (Echo House, even the uneven Stringer) are worth while."
4,Not the series,"No, this is not from the TV series. This is a video for the classroom. We use one similar to this for parenting classes were I teach. The whole series is designed to generate discussions about how to handle parenting issues. The title is confusing. Just be aware, you're not going to find Kurt Cameron anywhere on any of the DVD's from this series."
1,NOT the TV Series!!!,"Don't be fooled by shady sellers like Musicisus2001 who won't give refunds. This is really ""A Parent's Guide to Growing Pains."" Amazon should post a picture of the case to clarify all the confusion."
5,Excellent product,This is the second time I ordered this product. My son and husband had very dry feet. This cream has made a great difference. We all use it daily.
3,Gena Pedi Cure Foot Treatment,This product is OK but Iwould not buy it again. The write up is so much better than the actual product. I didn't feel any peppermint on my feet nor did I smell any peppermint in the creme while it was still in the tube. It was very disappointing.
1,IT STUNK!,This CD is in no way comparable to any of the other versions of Joseph. I have nothing against boy narrators; we had one in our school production...but this narrator is hardly talented at all! And the British accents are hard to understand and like.
1,This is NOT the original recording!,"I have the original on vinyl and was looking for a CD replacement.No such luck apparently.The original is by far the best and was performed as a cantata. So far as I know, it wasn't to become a stage production until after the success of ""Jesus Christ Superstar.""On the original, Jacob and Sons begins thus:""Way way back many centuries agoNot long after the Bible beganJacob lived in the land of CanaanA fine example of a family man""If you get a chance to hear the ACTUAL original, the others pale by comparison.I give this one star only because this is not the original Joseph."
4,Old but good,"This was the first recording of Joseph I ever heard. I loved it then and still do. It's not as well done as later recordings but the vocals are all really good and it's got a charm about it that the most recent versions of Joseph lack. An interesting thing about this recording is right before Potiphar there's a bit that JCS fans might recognize, Potiphar on this CD opens exactly like Pilate and Christ from any JCS recording. Just an observation :)"
4,"It's Got Great Performances, But Lots Of Songs Are Missing!","The prologue, GIVE ME MY COLORED COAT, and the Joseph Mega-Remix are missing from this recording! But I'll forgive it that because the prologue was added for Broadway in 1982, GIVE ME MY COLORED COAT was added for the 1986 Ford's Theatre production, and the Joseph Mega-Remix was added for the West End revival in 1991. Good job, guys!"
2,Fooled again,"I bought this thinking it was the same as the original 'Joseph' LP I used to listen to endlessly back in the early 70's, as a preadolescent. It appeared in the States to capitalize on the success of Superstar -- down to using hte same typography on the cover. But even though the vintage (1973) of this version is about right -- this *isn't* the same recording. In fact, though my memory may be gilding the original a bit -- this one's very much inferior. Has the original US release ever been transferred to CD?"
3,"close to the original, but not great","This version of the first Webber/Rice collaboration is, musically, closer to the classic original cast recording (not yet on CD, to my knowledge) than all others, but suffers from the comparison. I risk being labeled a purist, but having grown up listening to the Scepter recording, I miss the choir backings!"
5,Vin's essays may be the cure for cultural insanity !,"I have bought this collection of essays for my niece, nephews and two of my (grown) children. I hope they will grasp what is happening to this country. I hope they will get mad as hell and say no more. Not since Jerry Furland's novel ""Transfer"" have I read such an eye opening and chilling book. I grieve for those children, their parents, and even for the unbelievably callous acceptance of torture and murder committed by our own government against it's own citizens. While the flames at Waco have gone, the shame and the outrage of what was done there will burn forever. I know that anyone who reads this book will never feel the same again. Ever."
5,Another winner!,"Gillian Roberts has given readers another treat in HELEN HATH NO FURY. Spending time with Philadelphia high school teacher Amanda Pepper--charming, intelligent, witty, indepedent, with a sense of the gentle ironies of life--is always a pleasure. This series is one of my favorites because Roberts consistently entertains, even as she provides thoughtful exploration of contemporary society. In HELEN, Mandy is shocked by the apparent suicide of a member of her book group. Her attempt to put together a memory book for the dead woman's daughter leads her to wonder if the death really was a suicide. At the same time, one of Mandy's students comes to her with a serious problem. Roberts weaves the two stories into an engrossing , entertaining, throughly enjoyable whole. I'm going to put this one on the list for my book group!"
4,The truth is out!!!!,"Gillian Roberts had done it again. With grace and humor, she has written another page turner that her fans look forward to. Although the beginning is a little weak, this book picks up the pace after the 1st chapter and you don't want to put it down. AND there is a definate surprise in this book but I won't say any more and spoil it for all of those other Amanda Pepper fans out there."
4,Dragon NaturallySpeaking Preferred 9,"I have used Dragon NaturallySpeaking since version 5 and 9. Version 9 is a vast improvement over the previous versions. If you are looking for a voice recognition program that lets you kick your feet up on your desk and start dictating this is the program for you. I have tried Microsoft Speech and ViaVoice and I feel that Dragon NaturallySpeaking is far superior on many different levels.I was pleasantly surprised the Dragon NaturallySpeaking version 9 Preferred exceeded my expectations. In our society today that does not happen often.One warning I will give is that you need a fast machine, a great mike and lots of memory(1 gig or better). If you take a little time learning the program I am sure you will be as happy as I am. I am dictating this review with Dragon NaturallySpeaking."
2,POOR support,The product has some glitches and is difficult to get up and running. Support is all but nonexistant even if you are willing to pay them what is demanded to correct problem in their software. I have however nothing but praise for the support I recieved from Amazon with my issues.
1,SCAM!! ACTIVATION WILL NOT WORK IF YOU BUY NEW HARDWARE,"I purchased a retail copy of DNS. I used it for a year and would give it about 3 stars. Recently, however, I purchased a new harddrive. I reinstalled the software but when I went to activate it, Nuance's terrible customer service said it had been activated too often. I guess twice is too often. So, BEWARE, if you buy this product, you will NEVER be able to use it on any but the original computer. If your harddrive fails, like mine did, you are stuck and out the $150 purchase price. As for me, I wiil NEVER buy another Nuance product."
1,Shoot yourself now,"A complete waste of both disk space and money. If you purchase this product, buy a gun with one bullet and shoot yourself. You'll thank me later!Repeated efforts to dictate are an agonizing exercise in futility.Dictating to a monkey on meth would produce better results. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND RUN FAR, VERY FAR, AWAY!"
2,Not so hot for my purposes,"While I'm sure this would get much better if I spend a lot of time training it and learning how to use it effectively (I admit that I did not when I realized it wasn't a great tool for the reason I'd made the purchase), I was hoping to use it to transcribe interviews with a number of different speakers. It ended up being easier to use the tapes and handwritten notes than to use Dragon. Perhaps with a lot more training, I could at least get my part of the notes to work, or I could read the notes back to speed up the transcription. It was not helpful at all for the project for which I bought it. However, I know it has some wonderful uses for single users as intended - one person who trains Dragon and who learns all the formatting and other commands."
1,I wasted my money buying the software,"I regret spending $164 on this software, because it created more work for me in the long run. The program gets confused easily and when that happens, you might as well hang it up. It's like having to proof read everything I said, because of all the typos and word creations/substitutions. I learned I could curse like a sailor and it would just make up stuff. I would be finished seeing clients by 7 pm and this software would cause me to remain for an extra two to two and a half hours to finish my progress notes. I have given up on it and gone back to a dictation service. Save your money!"
1,Beware you need lots of RAM and fast processor,I received and returned mine for a refund today. On my new desktop it would not install - it said more RAM needed - it has 500Mb! On my new laptop it would not install - it said a faster processor was needed! Beware also you only get one free helpline call!I have discarded all Dragons and am using XP speech with no problems.
4,Speech software,This product makes my job (which is on the computer quite a bit of the time) so much easier and faster).
2,"Read Between The ""Hardware"" Lines","Dragon 9 may be a GREAT product, but didnt realize it had specific minimum hardware (CPU and memory) requirements. When I finally got a machine configuration to run it on, I pretty much ran out of time for my project. Ended up using Plan B. Anyway, I did get it installed and started to use it and I expect it to be fine."
3,Thanks for the info - I will not buy the product,"I had versions 6, 7 and 8 and now I have a new computer, so I thought I would start clean with version 9. However, the Nuance web site is not informative (it shows a features comparison between the various levels, but no explanation of what those features mean). Also, there is no place to search.I recall spending hours trying to discover how to get v. 8 to insert spaces when inserting text (no, the obvious ""NOSPACES OFF"" does not work for that purpose). Without a usable knowledgebase and $10/question for e-mail support, I think I am better off just continuing to type (I won't even bother reinstalling v. 8, even though I paid for it).I feel sorry for the rest of you."
1,"Maybe a dragon, but not a speaking one","I worked as a radio broadcaster doing news and advertising at large stations. But no matter how well I can enunciate, training this software has proved nearly impossible - at least for me. It fails to work well when attempting to dictate a short sentence or a long one. I spent two full days following their tutorial to get it to work properly. Because they have only high cost manufacturer's support I have avoided contacting them -- especially when the history of factory support for software has not been exemplary. Dragon Speaking Naturally is sure not worth the price they're asking for it. Very disappointing."
1,Never Received,We never received this purchased item and never received an answer to our E-Mails from this vendor !!
1,Requires significant computer resources,"Buyers beware. Version 9 would not even install on my 1.6 GHz laptop with 1 meg of RAM. An error screen comes up and says that the computer's processor is not fast enough. The manual says that 1 GHz with 1 Meg of ram are sufficient, but my ""real world"" experience was different. I really like version 8, but I think Dragon could do more to help version 9 users determine if their machine has the resources to run it."
1,Does not support Vista,I checked on Dragon's web site for system requirements & they do not list Vista so Amazon's system requirements are not accurate. FYI
1,Waste of time and $,Naturally speaking did not work for me after all the prelims. More like 5% right 95% wrong and the front end is hopelessly complicated. I have been doing computers since 1982 and this is a stinker.
5,So far worth the investment,"I just bought this product today from target for $30. And I learned how to use it within about 15-20 minutes. It was easy to install and set up. I read through the negative reviews and if people don't know how to set this program up then they must be computer illiterate. It types a lot faster than I can, and I type almost 90 words per minute. By the time I finish my statement, 1-2 seconds later, the sentence is typed. I am using it right now to write this review. I have only had to make one correction. It is very accurate. And will make my life a lot easier, since I have to have so many typed reports. As stated, it's worth it!(and it's pretty cool)"
5,Good Program,"The Dragon NaturallySpeaking Software Program was purchased for our Administrative Assistant. Over the last few years she has purchased several different types of keyboards in an effort to reduce the impact to the joints in her fingers.She said she has been able to learn and apply the majority of the functions this Program offers in a relatively short time and has been able to reduce her keyboarding by approximately 95%, with no noticeable loss in productivity. She said she would certainly recommend this program to anyone needing assistance with typing or data entry tasks."
3,Pretty good...just takes a while,"The product is good, it takes a while to set up with YOUR voice. It works best when you speak slower than normal, but it sure beats typing!"
3,Southern accent may be too much,Not sure why I have had such a hard time with this product when so many others seem to enjoy it. I think it comes down to my Southern accent.
2,"Most frustrating, annoying software I have ever worked with.","I'm lucky if it works correctly 50% of the time. I have gone through 3 microphones finally getting one that was certified by DNS, and purchased an exterior sound card, and it still can't even hear what I'm saying frequently.It won't even do the tutorial correctly. I have read to it until I'm blue in the face, in an effort to familiarize it with my voice. I have made every adjustment under the sun in the control panel that has to do with speech recognition software.It has even caused my computer to crash at least 3 or 4 times.I would say its better than nothing, and thats about it."
1,Dragon NaturallySpeaking Should Be Slayed,"First of all the headset that comes with the product is a toy and has to be handled delicately or it will break. Aside from dictating straight text in a word processor program it is useless. It hardly ever recognizes my speech, even after extensive training. Even when I say ""spell that..."" it does not recognize my pronounciation of the letters. It is frustrating trying to train the program to write the way I speak. It will open Windows Explorer but will not navigate through it. When I also try to transcribe from my digital voice recorder it just doesn't work. Finally, I have to pause to give it time to catch up to the rate that I speak. I speak faster than it is able to type."
2,Sadly behind the times,"I own Natually Speaking 9.0, and with a 32-bit system it works wonderfully. I probably get 98% accuracy after doing the advanced training readings. It's sad that a company with such a good start is so poor at keeping up with the market trending. In what way, you ask? Naturally Speaking does not load or work on a 64-bit system. It's not as if 64-bit is new, but rather it seems that Nuance is ""asleep at the wheel"" when it comes to keeping up. This prevents the owner from staying at the top of the curve regarding processing speed, and thus, accuracy. Incidently, I had no problem installing a ten year old version of Corel Word Perfect 8.0 on the 64-bit system, as well as other older programs. It was only the Nuance program that failed the test. The only soluttion may be to create a ""virtual"" 32-bit world within the 64-bit system to fool Nuance's program into thinking it is on the more advanced system."
2,PAID TOO MUCH EVEN WITH AMAZON!!!!,"NO ONE TOLD ME THAT THE NEW PREFERRED VERSION 10 WAS ABOUT TO COME OUT AND THAT LOCAL STORES WOULD OFFER THE PREFERRED VERSION 9 FOR $99.00!!! I PAID MUCH MORE THAN THAT!BY THE TIME I FOUND OUT, I ALREADY OPENED THE BOX AND INSTALLED IN MY COMPUTER. I AM STILL TEACHING IT HOW TO UNDERSTAND MY SIMPLE LANGUAGE WITH ONLY A MARYLAND ACCENT!I PAID TOO DARN MUCH!!!!!"
