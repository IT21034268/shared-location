3,I just don't have the patience to apply this stuff,"Finish Line Dry Teflon Lube is probably some of the best dry-lube available. I don't think I've found a lube that is more effective at lubricating a chain.However, as an overall product, it's just not very good. Why?1. You have to use a separate product to clean the chain.2. You have to be very careful and judicious about applying this product.3. You still have to wipe-down the chain.4. And the it's horrendously expensive which makes #2 even more critical.5. All of the above takes a lot time.Personally, I use it for lubricating other moving parts such as moving parts in clipless pedals, springs, or derailleur gears.For a chain lube, it's just too much hassle. If you have the time and dedication, use it. It works great. But for everyone else, I recommendRock N Roll Absolute Dry Chain Lube 16 oz. Bottle."
3,"Nice Smell, Doesn't Last","Based on the other review, I was very excited to try this product despite the cost. (Our diaper champ has been in use for two years now and we have to light candles to mask the odor of some diapers.) The spray has a pleasant odor, but it's power just doesn't last - and you have to use quite a lot of sprays on the offending diaper."
2,Really needs an AC adapter,"See the reviews for the AUA-1422 - a similar item with one extra 1394 port. Adaptec has some crazy requirements for a power supply (12V, 2.1A), and used to offer one that fit them through their store, but apparently no longer do! Without the adapter, this unit is only usable for items that draw almost no power through the USB or 1394 connection - which is a shame, because the Adaptec 1394 implementation was always the most stable on my machines. Look for one that includes an AC adapter or some other way of bringing power to the unit instead."
4,NO SUN :(,"I got this for my mom for mother's day because she has a gorgeous garden. She opted to put it on the deck so she can hear the water when they hang out under their canopy thing. From what I understand about a lot of solar panels is that they should be able to store up some energy; the only major disappointment I came across is that whenever the panel is even half way in the shade, the fountain stops running. When the sun is shinning bright, it trickles away.So if you're planning on using this outside, be prepared for an on again, off again fountain unless you have sun all the time. Mind you, I didn't expect it to work all night; but I did think if it got cloudy for 5 or 10 minutes, it would work throught it.But overall, my mom loves it and everyone that's seen it, adores it."
4,humorous girl power Don Juan play,"I read this play after enjoying Pygmalion. Shaw creates a female lead who uses her femininity and supposed delicacy/cluelessness to manipulate those around her, ultimately trapping the Don Juan-esque male lead into marrying her despite his objections to the institution. Although she pretends to be helpless, she actually controls the situation, so I think this counts as a feminist work, although I'm confused about what his ultimate message is. I'm also not sure how the whole philosophy of the life-force, superman thing fits in, but I haven't read much philosophy, and I enjoyed the play regardless. Like all of Shaw's stuff, the play contains social commentary, humor, and wit."
5,a philosphical comedy,"The writings of Bernard Shaw in this particulat play, invites to you use your mind to understand life and philosphy. It has such great insight into many aspects of human nature and at the same time is exteremely funny and really takes you into it's pages. The writing has impecable style and this is truly a classic play."
1,Viewsonic builds products that don't last,"Viewsonic customer service is nonexistent and product support worse than poor. Products are poorly made and will not last. Call technical support 1800-688-6688 and see how long you have to wait for a service rep. Online you get someone to respond who barely speaks English. I bought a plasma TV for $3000 and it failed in less than 3 years. Viewsonic reaction: Too bad, you should have bought a warranty and we'll fix it in 48 hours. Without one, you are on your own. I think something bought for $3000 should last more than 3 years, and Viewsonic should too. Viewsonic intentionally builds products that won't last to sell you an expensive product warranty. I wouldn't buy Viewsonic again and don't think you should either until they built a better product and improve their customer support."
5,The book would make those who demonize China unhappy.,The book stays almost unknown in the U.S. only because it provides solid evidences of how aggressive India was. It is an offense to those see China as a demon and India as an angle of democracy.
2,Shares several track with Everything I Need. I prefer Everything I Need instead,"While this album isn't bad, several of the songs also exist on the Everything I Need album. I own both and in my opinion, the Everything I Need versions of these songs are much better."
4,"A lighter, funnier ""Girl, Interrupted"". Different role for Galifinakis who did a good job. Watch it. I say B+","A depressed high schooler commits himself in to a psychiatric ward and discovers himself. After a year of suicidal thoughts and dreams, caused by the stress of getting in to a good school, Craig (Gilchrist) commits himself ""accidentely"" to a psych ward at the local hospital. While there he meets new friends Noelle (Roberts) and Bobby (Zach Galifianakis) and realizes he has more to give. The subject matter is serious but the movie is actually pretty light-hearted and...kind of funny...(get it?). Galifianakis plays a different role in this then we are used to, but does a good job with it and I would not be surprised to see more like this come his way. I can't talk too much about this without giving anything away but I would definatly pick this one up. A feel good movie about mental patients, how many of those have you seen? I give it a B+.Would I watch again? - Yes, I think I would."
4,Sixteen-and active,"Keir Gilchrist, an impressive kid actor of kid movies, had grown up as well as his character-a sixteen year old sex-experimenting pupil who had checked himself into psycho ward to cure from depression with a single pill only.It is surely a deep-meaningful work for viewers M15+, of a kind of such a medicine and a world in and outside the nut house screened."
3,I expected more,"I thought this movie was alright, nothing spectacular. Honestly, I was hoping much more. If your thinking about purchasing it, think it over. It's not expensive, but I've had it for months now and have only watched it once. Something you watch once in a blue moon."
5,Just what I expected,"Good movie with good story line. Just what I expected from this, good story line with live issues. Not a typical Hollywood movie."
5,one of my favorite movies at the moment,"Beautiful movie. Very inspiring. Couldn't have imagined better actors for it, they were perfect! Healing is possible and things look up eventually, it's just a matter of perspective ;)"
4,Thought Provoking,I liked it. The message was good and there is plenty of relating points. I think they did a good job of blending humor with realistic life experiences. The cast does a good job holding my attention throughout the movie. Worth the watch if you like Sundance type films.
4,touching,this movie was a mix of a comedy with some profound words. i've always wondered what a mental facility was and this movie has cleared it up for me. i absolutely love craig an noelle they make the cutest couple!
3,Manages to Add Something New to Mental Ward Films,"There are plenty of movies, if not books set in Mental Wards or Institutions: One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Slaughterhouse Five, Catch-22 and many others you can probably think of. It is a little tired and tiring to set a movie in such a place now, but ""It's Kind of a Funny Story"" manages to use this setting to consider the awkward boy learns valuable lessons about life and self from quirky eccentric figures who may or may not have a mental illness genre. It is though not especially interested in exploring the mentally ill or mental institutions, so don't expect this movie to shed any new light on the subject."
1,"ugly lighting, poor cast, trite story","I could not finish this mess...everyone in it should be embarrassed kind of a very poor production , story and cast!"
2,Slow Paced and Dragging,Slow paced and dragging this story could have been told in a better way. Even those with mental illness are not so lackluster. I was grateful for fast forward.
1,It's not a story I'd like to hear again.,"I was expecting this movie to be like Eternal Sunshine or Garden State, a youthful drama. The lead in the movie was this entitled New York brat that checked himself into a mental hospital because he had a little stress from his prep school. Give me a break. I was hoping that by the end of the movie he would introspect a bit and find out that he was just being melodramatic, but instead the movie was biased to his point of view. The movie was not believable and the characters were not developed well at all."
2,"Boring, hackneyed, terrible acting","Beware the five-star reviews. This is a slow, cliche-filled, horribly-acted, unfunny, cloying disaster of a movie. I'm a big Zach G. fan, but he doesn't begin to salvage this crappy flick."
4,Funny and interesting,"We liked this movie. It has interesting characters and subject that is at times funny, sad and touching. I would recommend it."
4,Insightful!,"Funny and yet very insightful of our human nature . Everyone has issues in their life, learning to handle them is what life is all about. Enjoyed it ."
5,Smart and Funny,"Good teenish movie that is for all the age groups. Funny scenes, some serious ones, and Zach has a couple of solid moments. Give it a chance, it will make you smile in a genuine way. And what would be wrong with that?"
2,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,"...except it's not! This film is supposed to be an uplifting comedy, however I found it painfully predictable and a bit sad. Keir Gilchrist was great, playing Craig, a young mental patient who wants to kill himself. Gilchrist and the flashes of his thoughts, that we get to see, are the best part of this film and the only thing really worth seeing. Zach Galifianakis, who is one of my favorites, isn't at all funny, he's actually kind of pathetic in this film. Despite Gilchrist performance, the movie is actually quite stupid, I mean what kind of mental hospital lets the patients have access to the roof of the hospital? It looked good, has some really good actors in it, but nothing happens, the story is predictable as hell, and it's a ""comedy"" in which no one really says or does anything funny. I was hugely disappointed with it."
4,Surprising,"My husband and I were really, pleasantly surprised at how GOOD this movie was. We had no idea what it really was about, and it was REALLY good!! NO ( or little) profanity, good characterizations, heart-warming without being sappy. We rate it a 4 and I really want my 29 year old son to see it. He likes ""off-beat"" movies. This is a winner!!"
4,Fundy and very good,An interest twist on teen problems and what love maybe all about. The out come isn't in question but the trip is unusal.
2,It's Kind of a Tragic Story,"Any story whose premise is the would be suicide of a teenager is rather too cynical to be saved by dark humor. I'm not one to take things too seriously to see the humor in everyday life; in fact I consider doing so to be humans' best coping mechanism. But this movie falls prey like so many others these days to the urge to drastically overstate its thesis lest the slow-witted fail to grasp it. You can't start with miserable and strive for sardonic irony. You can start with sardonic irony and strive for humor, sure, but going waaaay too dark from the start makes it impossible to be lighthearted to the grown-ups out there. Think the difference between Little Miss Sunshine and One Flew Over Cuckoos Nest: this is trying for the former and nailing the latter but without the social commentary. No upside here."
3,It's *Kind* of a Funny Movie...,"Better than I expected, but certainly no surprises. Good for a Sunday afternoon rental. Also: People in the nuthouse are never this beautiful, sexy, alluring, or fascinating. Ever."
2,Good story but would not recomend it,This movie needed a little more to it. It seemed like it was going to become really interesting throughout the movie but just kind of stays in the same place. Would not recomend it.
5,A must have for beginners to pros,I have thoroughly enjoyed reading this book cover to cover. It goes into as much detail as you need to get started and points you to other resources if you want to go deeper into any one subject. This really is a must read for any one who wants to get involved or has been invloved for years in developing better products for end users.It seems that any book from the Adaptive Path team is an excellent resource and only adds to their leadership in this field. Well done Mike and thanks for making my job easier.
5,I liked it,The IZ is really cool! I like the colors! It is always entertaining me and it is so cute! I have a red one. I like the way it's body moves! This toy is awesome!
4,My daugher really likes it.,"Funky and cool speaker toy. the sound is pretty good, and the noises it makes are a little rude, but funny too. My 11 year old really likes it a lot... especially when it just comes out with something out of the blue. It does make noises during the playback of her iPod, but if she wants to listen to the music without that noise she has plenty of options. We are happy with our purchase."
2,IZ,Fun if you have a young male child that isnt into the music... it fart and burps and makes annoying noises during the music. not the toy for me but i think little boys would find it funny (but i do see it getting old quick)
2,Boring,"I bought this for my 13-year-old stepson thinking it would be a cool toy. It turned out to just be annoying and he got bored with it in a day. It was way too expensive for what it really is, an annoying noise machine."
2,a novelty,"If you are looking for a 'toy' that lights up and kinda plays music, then this is the product for you. Looking back at my purchase of IZ-it just seems like a waste of money."
3,Cute but kids got bored with it quickly,"IZ is pretty cute with all his different modes and sounds. But, the kids get bored with it quickly. It is one of those toys they get out once is a while for a day or two...then forget it again."
3,eh - cool but i don't what the hype is all about.,"Cool looking speakers. That's about it. It's not good enough for a party or anything if you are looking for real speakers. It interrupts the songs as you play them by making some strange but cool noises. It makes it's own music/beats too when you dont have anythign attached to it. Personally, it's a waste of money. It's fascinating at first, maybe just for the first few minutes. Your kids are probably going to be fascinated -- just for a few minutes too (and you will fight them not to touch it or pick it up, because the cord is so short that's attached to your ipod or what have you.) The cord from and to the IZ is about 8 inchest long give and take. It's an annoying thing to have. Fun to show to your friends for only a FEW MINUTES. Then everyone will tell you to turn the darn thing off coz it's ruining the music with the talking/beats, etc. This will be fun for college kids who are on crack!! That's about it..."
4,Creative musical fun for sure!!,I love it! So does my 4 year old! He plays with it and creates different tunes & the price was right!!!
5,The Absolute Best,This is the very best of Mellencamp on a 3CD set. The only way it could be better is if it were a 4CD set with even more songs! All the favorites; all good! Mellencamp has that classic folk-rock sound; a message with a beat. This CD set is never far from my hands. It is a 100% hands down best buy.
5,In The Wet,"Absolutely wonderful, one of Nevil Shute's best novels. It takes you on a journey of the mind and heart, transporting you to a different world."
2,Onlyof historical interest,"I like Shute, and I am a frequent visitor to Queensland, but this novel and its characters seemed dated and unsatisfying. It was a 1952 ""thought experiment"" about a future for Queen Elizabeth and Australia that would bring us up to the present. There is a political agenda; this is less a ""yarn"" than what Shute is known for."
1,Mechanical and lacking subtlety,"After listening and falling in love with recordings by Richter, I went back and re-listened to Barenboim's version...I couldn't recognize the piece. None of the phrasing and feeling. The beauty and feeling was completely stripped away, leaving only the notes..."
2,Disappointing,"I give this collection of sonatas only two stars because the way they were recorded only allows two fifths of them to play on my Bose. I returned them once, received a quick replacement - the same. Most of them have to be played in the car. Also, I believe Barenboim plays some of the sonatas too fast - just because he can."
3,A pleasant but unexceptional fantasy,"Empire of Bharaghlaf has been blessed with a thoughtful and kind Emperor. Alas, he is almost powerless, and the ruthles noble houses scheme and murder with little restraint. Meanwhile, the slums remain poor and deadly for their inhabitants.The book describes a group of children from the slums, when they become embroiled in noble schemes. It's written mostly for young adults; there are some intense scenes in the book, though.The most prominent character, Ferret, is interesting, but the viewpoints shifts constantly between different characters, leaving little room for engagement. Most of the action is streamlined, almost oversimplified; and the magic is fairly superficial.On the whole, a pleasant fantasy, but not gripping, original or intricate enought to stand out...."
5,Out late,"Excellent, wish it was longer to look into more of their lives. Education is the key to letting people understand what someone endures to be happy in life"
4,Nashville Pussy Rocks!!,"I first heard Nashville Pussy when I bought the soundtrack to Dee Snider's STRANGELAND. I was blown away, I wanted to go out and buy the album right away. They're very cool and fun to listen to. I think they should get a song played on the radio, it would let more people know about them."
3,"No Fast Songs Like The ""R"" album.","This album was okay. Too many slow songs. I was looking for something like Home Alone, which was a great fast song. I still say his last album was better than this one. Don't get me wrong, I like the album, all the songs are great, just no hip-hop, jump to the beat songs if you know what I mean."
5,THE ALBUM TO HAVE ESPECIALLY NOW....CLASSIC,"With all going right now with the posibility of a War, this THE BEST OPTION TO HAVE FOR EVERYONE TO LAID BACK AND ENJOY SMOOTH, SOULFUL,STRONG AND MAGICAL MUSIC AT HIS HIGH POINT. This is clearly THE BEST R&B; ALBUM EVER MADE. R.Kelly just put out here ALL HIS HEART, MIND, VOICE AND SOUL TO IT. You will love every song on THE CLASSIC ALBUM OF THE MILLENIUM...TP-2.COM. From the first track to the last one. YOU PEOPLE DOESN`T KNOW OF WHAT A CLASSIC PRECIOUS ALBUM ALL ARE MISSING.THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE R.KELLY,as said in the ""One Me"" Sensual Love and Sexual Beautiful Ego song.GO GOOOOOOOOO NOW...AND BUY 5 COPIES OF THIS MASTERPIECE GEM."
4,freak come out at night,"r kelly goes back to his freaky roots on this one, if you wanna hear kelly talk about oral sex for the millionith time please get this, if you love bump-n-grind, 12 play and classic kelly then this is especially for you. fellas, ladies you better protection on this."
4,"Hit Single is sad, Cd is about SEX...","If you like R. Kelly, then you will know his type of music. Sexual, he's always talking about ""Bumping N' Grinding"" and getting it on, and making love. Well this CD has a little more groove to it, the music in the backround is simply magnificent, and the lyrics are heart felt. This is a Must for any CD listener. If you like Jazz, and Rap, and R&B you got it all in one package here. The song ""Womans Threat"" Is a great song for all you guys who know how women can be, It's such a true song. And alot of the other songs are great..Including heart felt lyrics like ""I was supposed to be a man about it, wasn't supposed to leave your side, no way no how...."" The songs called I don't mean it, YOU Have to listen to this song, it will bring tears to your eyes...*Sniff sniff* This Cd is strictly great. Buy it and add it to your collection."
4,R. Kelly's Biggest Fan,I love him...but I have to admit I'm kinda growing up and he's not growing with me. It's good but not his best. My favorite song is I Mean (I Don't Mean It)...totally tight!
4,Best One Yet,"This is R Kelly's best album yet...most all the tracks are nothing short of spectacular...all this coming when I was ready to write 2000 off as a bust for new (quality) R&B. What more can I say, the man's gifted. This isnt one of those albums that we have all bought for the one song we like....Kelly gives us 19 ""panty droppin"" tunes that you wont be able to get enough of (either will your lady). Wasnt a fan of the R album...huge fan of the TP-2 album. Get this one you wont regret it!"
5,THIS IS THE BEST R&B ALBUM EVER MADE. R.KELLY IS # 1.,"Simply R.Kelly can make music at his best.This is a MASTERPIECE that you can enjoy hear it from the first track to the last one without pushing the skip bottom. ALL the 19 songs(produced,written,arranged and performed by Kelly)are BLAZIN AND SLAMMIN GEMS.THIS IS A TRUE CLASSIC,MUCH BETTER THAN 12PLAY ONE. I dont have to tell my favorite songs because the entire album, each and every track is RED HOT.I DONT KNOW ONE PERSON THAT DIDNT LIKE IT. R.KELLY IS MY FAVORITE MALE ARTIST OF ALL TIME.If you love SLOW JAMS,REAL R&B AND SOUL,THIS IS THE BEST OPTION FOR ANYONE. SO GO AND BUY THIS CLASSIC NOW. TRUST ME,ITS WORTH MUCH MORE THAN THE [money]."
3,Some good songs,There are some really good songs on this cd. There also some really bad songs on here. It is up to you. Do you wanna pay ... bucks for one song?
4,OKAY..HERE WE GO AGAIN,YES THE ALBUM IS OKAY THATS ALL. NOTHING ON HERE CAN SURPASS WHAT HE HAS DONE ALREADY. HE PAINTS GRAPHIC PICTURE FROM THE DAYZ OF OLD WHETHER ITS FROM 12 PLAY AND I BELIEVE AND SADIE. THERE WERE NO JAMS LIKE HE HAD ON THE R CD W/ THAT KEITH MURRAY JOINT THAT'S STILL AJAM AT ANY PARTY. THIS IS A SEX ME BABY I'M SORRY CD. WITH A GOOD COMMERCIAL SONG I WISH JUST TO MAKE SURE WE GO PLATINUM. YA DIG.
3,"R. Kelly is still good, but not for long","R.Kelly is still doing his thing on this album. There's few songs that is worth hearing. Track 2,5,8,10,15 are ok. The problem with this album is that there's no major change on his style of singing, after a while you can't tell the differences.If you are a huge R. Kelly fan, you should try this album."
2,Is R Kelly in identity crisis?,"R Kelly actually got me into listening to cool romantic melodious black music. His past albums followed a style typical to only him. However TP-2.com got me wondering whether he is losing touch to his unique style or whether he is just trying to prove he can also do what others are doing. Either way, it is a pity because the album didn't reflect his identity. It is not a CD worth buying even if you are a fanatic fan of R Kelly."
2,"""I Wish"".....I never bought this album","This is a very disappointing release. I'm sure R. Kelly worked hard on this release, but the lack of content of the songs written on this album is disturbing. The production, while clear, is uninspiring. ""I Wish"" is the only gem on this album.This effort is reminisent of the 1994 album 12 Play. However, 12 Play (94') release is loaded with heavy bass and catchy tunes. TP-2.com is an album for the ""fans"". Unfortunately, fans are willing to accept anything these day. After the 1998 release ""R"", Kelly showed everyone that he is a skilled songwritter and producer. TP-2.com leaves you with one question, what happened between to Kelly?"
5,"HEY, EVERY PERSON LOVED THIS CLASSIC !","Seems like R.Kelly is getting BETTER AND BETTER, EVERY TIME HE RELEASE A NEW ALBUM. AND THIS IS NO EXCEPTION.THIS IS THE CD THAT I LOOKED FOR A LONG TIME,TRULY A PERFECT CLASSIC. ALL the people that I know LOVE IT TO DEATH, ESPECIALLY: STRIP FOR YOU,R&B; THUG,GREATEST SEX,I DON`T MEAN IT, JUST LIKE THAT,DON`T YOU SAY NO,ONE ME,I WISH AND THE REMIX, WOMAN THREAT, I DECIDED, FEELIN ON YO BOOTY AND THE STORM IS OVER. IF YOU WANT THIS MULTIPLE PLATINUM ALBUM (4X PLATINUM IN U.S.A,AND ANOTHER THREE MILLION COPIES SOLD AROUND THE WORLD),TRUST ME!, IT`S WORTH MUCH MORE THAN THE 15 TO 20 BILLS THAT COST."
4,keep your levels up,"i bought this cd today and it was hot, hot, hot as expected. r kelly is talented and yo'all need to get this. it takes you back to the days of 12 play. this needs to be in your cd player right next to the joe and carl thomas for good measure (and pleasure) and keep your levels up."
5,one of the best r&b artists of all time,"Any emotion you feel R. Kelly will touch it with this masterpiece of an r&b album. I know R. kelly can be a little overally sexual with his lyrics but overall this album is really good. I recommend it to any who likes r&b artist like Ginuwine. Best track is probably ""I wish"" which touches anyone who ever lost someone they truly love. Don't let the parental advisory sticker stop you from buying this album. This has to be the best r&b album this year and probably for awhile because you don't see a lot of r&b artists like R.Kelly scoring this big..."
4,A new R&B R.Kelly,"Two weeks ago I bought his R. album because I heard some of its singles and I thought it'd be a great album. Finally, my intuition was right and his last album was great, but 30 songs are too many to be different between them. Last week I saw TP-2.COM in a shelf and I decided to buy it thinking that it'd be like R.But not, it's more excellent than his last effort. All the songs have rythm, especially ""Like a freak (one of my favourites), all the songs talked about different views of the love, and the song dedicated to his mom is da bomb. ""I wish"" is his greatest song since ""I believe I can fly"". I don't get it 5 stars because the theme of sex is very repetitive in the album. There are tones of themes apart from sex. But I think is the best album R. Kelly has done. Well done..."
4,R Kelly TP-2.com,"Hello Everyone,I have listened to this cd and I wanted to share my opinion. I enjoyed it. Because everything he talks about is really happening. Like, for instance. The song I wish (to the homies that were lost) It's talking about a guy thats was involved in gangs and stuff like that and he ended up dead. There are so many people that die every day because of stuff like that. It's just nice that that someone finally decided to tell the truth about it. R Kelly did that. Well Thats my opinion. If you don't like it than thats yours.But to anyone that enjoys Rap and R&B I would recomend this cd."
3,"Not his greatest, but grows on You","There is no denying the fact R Kelly has got a great voice and is very talented, that is why he can turn some mediocre songs into hits. This album may not impress you the first time you listen to it, neither is it his greatest album to date. But there are a couple of good songs on there. Songs such as ""Just Like That"" , ""Fiesta"", ""I Wish"", ""A Woman's Threat"", ""I Mean(I Don't Mean It)"" and the inspirational ""The Storm is Over Now"" are the ones that really stands out, and the more you listen to it the more it grows on you. But compared to ""12 Play"" this album is a three star."
5,TRULY A BLAZING & SMOOTH MASTERPIECE. !!!,"WHAT CAN I SAY??? ""TP-2.COM"" IS THE BEST ALBUM EVER MADE BY A R&B; SINGER. BUT R.KELLY IS MORE THAN A SINGER...HE IS A LIVING LEGEND. HE IS WHAT MUSIC IS ABOUT. THE WHOLA ALBUM IS VERY PASSIONATE, BEAUTIFUL, RAW,INSPIRING AND DEEP AS HELL. ALL OF THE SONGS ARE MADD HOTT....BUT THE BEST JOINTS ON IT ARE (NOT IN ORDER: ""I WISH"" & HIS REMIX, "" WOMAN'S THREAT"", ""STRIP FOR YOU"", ""ONE ME"", ""JUST LIKE THAT"", ""I DON'T MEAN IT"", ""DON'T YOU SY NO"", ""FEELIN ON YO BOOTY"", ""THE GREATEST SEX"", ""I DECIDED"", ""ALL I REALLY WANT"" AND THE INSPIRING GOSPEL ""THE STORM IS OVER NOW"".IF DON'T HAVE IT, SOON YOU WILL BE ADDICTED TO R.KELLY'S MUSIC AND THIS GIANT PHENOMENAL CLASSIC ALBUM. IS 100 MORE TIMES WORTH THAN ANYOTHER ALBUM FROM OTHER R&B;/SOUL OR HIP-HOP ALBUM. THIS ALBUM HAVE IT ALL. BUY AT LEAST 2 COPIES OF IT. IS THAT AMAZING, I GUARANTEE IT !!!"
2,T(een)P(orn)-2.com,"Another bad album by the Pete Townsend of R&B. If you love R&B, then you'll probably dig this...but for me, R&B has no place in my album collection, especially an R&B album by a child molester. I gave him 2 stars cuz he's a good singer."
3,R. Kelly is amazing.....most of the time,"When R. Kelly is at the top of his game, he is one of the greatest R & B singers in the biz. Like pretty much every other Kelly album, there are the standout songs, but the rest are just fill-ins. Standouts on this album are the upbeat ""fiesta"", the emotional ""I Wish"" (both versions), the eerily bumpy ""A Woman's Threat"", the uplifting "" The Storm is Over"" and the slow emotional ""the Greatest Sex"". The rest of the album is mediocre. Had Kelly cut the number of songs on this album, he could have made an album you could listen all the way through, and love the whole thing......unfortunately for us, he didnt."
2,HEARD IT ALL BEFORE,YOU KNOW SOMETIME HIS MUSIC ALL SOUNDS THE SAME .DON'T GET ME WRONG HE IS VERY VERY TALENTED BUT THIS CD JUST REALLY DOES NOTHING 4 ME IT SOUNDS LIKE SOMTHING THAT HE HAS DO BEFORE HE JUST REMASTERD IT .TRY AGAIN KELLY BECAUSE YOU DID NOT PULL THE SHEETS OVER MY HEAD WITH THIS ONE.
3,Not one of the best in the series...,"Encyclopedia Brown is a detective, not a chef. But, in Encyclopedia Brown Takes the Cake, the mysteries are followed by an recipe, which I presume the case is surrounded by. This is not one of Sobol's best books, in my opinion. My main problems are that the children's book doesn't have the humor & fun that most of the other books in the Idaville series has, plus,I didn't like that fact that some of the solutions are quasi-found by turning to the cookbook-part of the section. I would have liked to have the recipes in its own section instead following each and every case. (In fact, there's one recipe that didn't have a case attached to it.) However the Boy Detective still has his mental stuff and the cases are still very readable"
4,Encyclopedia Brown is everyone's favorite cook!,"Encyclopedia Brown is everybody's favorite cook, in this case the food he cooks is a mystery. There is a mystery at the end of each chapter. He knows lots of recipes. One of the mysteries is the cake. Read the book to find out who takes the cake.I recommend this book to people who like to read cooking books as well as a mystery story. If you get hungry as you read a cooking book, I recommend that you should not read it. It has lots of good recipes."
3,TOO MANY RECIPES!!,"I liked this book, but there were TOO MANY RECIPES!!!!!!!!!!!! I almost died from reading all the recipies. DO NOT READ THIS BOOK UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES IF YOU DON'T LIKE RECIPES!!!!! After reading this book you will have died in four different dimensions!! I do not recommend this for anyone who does not like recipes!!This book is mainly about a boy named Leroy who solves lots ofcases and learns to be a good cook. Many of the cases are veryexciting, but the recipes -- not so much. If you can solvethe cases as well as he can, you could probably start your owndetective agency like he did. He has his own business wherepeople walk up to it and pay him 25 cents to have him solvecases for them. Leroy's nick name is Encyclopedia because he'sso smart he's like an encyclopedia with feet walking around,ready to solve any case.Without the recipes, I would give this book five stars sincethe cases are so exciting."
3,donated to the public library......,donated to the public library......The Psychic Pathway: A Workbook for Reawakening the Voice of Your Soul....hoping others will enjoy this book also....I read a lot of books this one was good but not great!~
3,In the starting phase,Until a finish th book and I'm able to apply the practices within I can only say that it is easy to follow and I hope it helps to aide the ability that we all share. Of course we only get out of something what we put into it.
5,Still with me everywhere I go after 5 years...,"I first met Sonia in her Heart's Desire workshop (which was excellent!) 5 years ago. Since then I've had the privelege of having a reading done by her. It was amazing. Much of what she said has come true, and manifested in my life to my utter amazement! My own psychic awareness has gotten stronger as well, through the use of the book. I can't seem to live without it! It is the one book I take with me on all my travels near or far. I can refer to it for support, or inspiration whenever I feel the need, and it is a wonderful source for that. I'm sure anyone who is looking to improve thier life even the slightest bit will be happy with this purchase. It will change your life... and there are many surprises in store for you if you follow through with the excercizes in the book. Thank you Sonia for being a source of light and inspiration in my life, and so many others!"
5,Appreciative,"As always, Sonia takes you on a ride worth the trouble. She is someone with a marvelous gift that she's sharing with us. I'm learning a lot."
5,"Happy, happy, okay","I love the book, but the condition wasn't quite what I expected. There was a large area of water damage, but book still readable. So I'm okay with it."
2,Too much story telling,"This book reads more like short stories of the authors experiences, mixed in with stories of other peoples experiences. Each chapter is presented at the most beginner level, which is nice, but repeats very simple ideas, then flies off into 10 pages of a related story. If you are looking to simply just take the cap off the bottle of psychic development this is the book. If you want to read about the author plus Jane, Dick and Joes success then this is most def. the book."
5,Sonia Choquette is wonderful!,"I love all of Sonia`s books. They are the easiest to read and most enjoyable ""self help"" books I have ever read. I would recommend her books to anyone even if they aren't on a spiritual path to learn how to be psychic.Her books are a gift and I am always sad when they end."
4,Very Interesting,"Found this book when looking for that missing something. It seems to celebrate the ""coincidences"" that no one around me cares about. I never knew they might be helpful. Love the meditation sessions. I'm working on getting rid of the ""clutter"" one little project at a time. I have high hopes for this book. Great insight even if the psychic part of it doesn't go far. Very good reading."
5,Interesting reading,This book provides a systematic approach to finding your way in the oft-clouded world of the psychic realm. Sonia really has got it all together.
4,Grounded For Life,I dont agree with all the views of this book and quickly passed it on. It discusses some valuable advice for new parents of teenagers.
5,"Mstislav, Yo-Yo, move over","How has so much of this incredibly beautiful music escaped my attention for so long? I knew the Saint-Saens and the Rachmaninov and one of the Faure pieces, but the rest were totally unfamiliar. On this disc, Han-Na Chang brings this rarely heard music out into the light of day, and renders both the unfamiliar and the familiar with superb tone coloring and deeply felt interpretations.This is simply the most beautiful and moving cello playing I have ever heard. It's going to spend a lot of time in my CD player."
3,Too much hype!,"First off, let me start by saying that i am a young cellist who listens to a lot of recordings and i am normally very open minded as to hearing new artists and repetoire. I bought this cd a couple months ago hoping to hear this so called queen of the cello or so she has been hyped up to be. When i put in the disc and pressed play i was pretty dissapointed. Han-na's playing can be extremely boring. Don't get me wrong, her technique is flawless and the program on the cd is quite good (i have played many of these songs and it's all great music) but her musicality at this point is very inexperienced. I hate being the only reviewer to give less than five stars but i really don't thing she deserves it. Not for this disc. Give her time, i'm sure she'll grow to be a seasoned artist."
4,Great flick above Basic Instinct!,"If you're into mind games, this is a movie treat for you. I'm glad this dvd is out so i added it to my collection. For the price i paid for this dvd, it is worth it. In this movie, Kim Basinger played a sweet & innocent but daring role into pursuing an opportunity of getting rid of her rich husband (Eric Roberts). The object of her desire is her sister (Uma Thurman) and hunk psychologist (Richard Gere) who all three gamble for deceit and manipulation. The question is, who of the three will prevail? The movie naturally ignites with heavy drama and suspense with metaphores and their meaning. This is what Richard Gere, the psychologist, needs to figure out. I just love that part when Richard Gere entraps Kim Basinger in saying ""You're right about double jeopardy"". I think this is the best acting role that Kim Basinger had ever pursued over all her other movies even LA Confidential, where she won Golden globe award as best actress."
2,Good movie -- bad DVD,"This thriller was always an extremely entertaining Hitchcock knockoff (nothing at all like Basic Instinct, despite the other reviews here) -- if you could buy Gere as a therapist, and that's not hard, since he's not playing a *smart* therapist -- but a lot of the charm of the movie was how gorgeous it was visually, and this DVD does not give you the gorgeous anarmorphic widescreen picture you expect from a DVD. It's formatted to fit your (square) screen. I would much rather have paid 20 bucks for the expected widescreen version -- since I already had the VHS, this wasn't even worth 10. (Yes, I admit I should have read the product description more carefully, but I didn't realize people were releasing widescreen movies on DVD without a widescreen option -- why should they, for crying out loud? -- so I got blindsided. I post this to warn others like myself.)"
3,"GREAT LEADS, HARE-BRAINED SCRIPT","Was it two love triangles, or three? Difficult to tell in this twistathon psychological thriller that couldn't resist the tempation of ending in your customary lighthouse sequence on an inclement night with the hero hanging by his fingernails high above the lashing tides below.Long after you've forgiven the newly discovered condition of Pathological Intoxication (one I'm convinced the director suffered from) which causes the sufferer to go berserk after so much as touching alcohol, you will recognize that the chemistry of Basinger and Gere and Therman, and permutations thereof, is great, but the plot soon puts on maillots and starts twisting like an immigrant ballerina.Take copious notes when you watch it, which you must, if only for some excellent acting especially by Eric Roberts as a mean millionaire. You may emerge dazed or goofy, convinced that you've seen a humdinger, but you won't be able to describe it so it won't hurt all that much."
3,An Engrossing Thriller!!!,"I recently saw this movie for the first time and was pretty surprised at how much I liked it. Even though the plot was weak, I thought the acting was pretty decent. Gorgeous Kim Bassinger plays the sister of Uma Thurman who is a psychiatric patient of Richard Gere. Gere gets involved with Bassinger, who is unhappily married to Eric Roberts, a mafia-type businessman. Bassinger kills him (Roberts); and has Gere and a lawyer-friend of his represent her in a trial. Just when you think that you know how the movie is going to end, then there is another twist. First you think that Thurman is the psychologically ill one, then Bassinger, then both. But it is not as simple as that either. There is a curmudgeonly detective played by the terrific character actor Keith David. Just give this one a chance. You don't have to necessarily own it, but I would say to rent it at least. Make your own ""Final Analysis""."
1,would someone please get Kim B a pair of decent shoes?,"This movie was a travesty of Hitchcockian devices. Old Alfred would roll in his grave. The acting was wooden, the dialogue cliched and predictable and not very convincing (wouldn't a Freudian analyst have recognized the flower arranging dream case study right away?) Bassinger looks like she's been on too many meds, with her bloated face and more-than-normally squinted eyes. Nor can she play a psychotic with any zest: when she lost it in the restaraunt in her husband's presence, running up the stairs and proceeding to yell and flail, I felt embarrassed for her. If I had more space I could go on, but I want to end with one burning question; Why the hell didn't the wardrobe mistress give Bassinger a decent pair of stilleto pumps to at least wear with her slinky black backless dress, if she insisted on outfitting her through the whole movie with dopey little flats?"
2,"Terrible DVD, ok movie","The quality of this DVD is bad; that's being kind. It's a full-screen movie transfer, which some people actually prefer because they like to miss a lot of the movie. Also, the transfer is very grainy.The actually movie isn't that much better. You see what could have been, but instead they try to throw around a few twists just because they think they should. Uma Thurman is wonderful. That's about all this movie has to offer. Very DUM ending."
1,Worse than the worst of Cable TV,"""Final Analysis"" is one of the worst, silliest films I have ever seen. I have now abandoned Philip Joanou's filmography. It is slavishly formulaic, and just plain dumb, they couldn't even get the effects right. This is one of the few times that you will most certainly find something better on the Lifetime Network instead."
3,A good film with significant flaws,"Despite a number of problem areas, this R rated film is pretty good. The movie moves rather slowly during the first half. The plot line, the fooling and taking advantage of a doctor and lawyer, is not new, and this film is not strikingly different than many others. The ancients had a problem ending plays, so they resorted to deus ex machina, which means that a god descended in a machine, for the actor playing god could not fly, and the deity resolved the complex matter simply. Many modern movies build up complex plots, which would take hours to resolve, and solve them in a near deus ex machina manner. I don't want to reveal the film's ending, but viewers will see this happening here and, for that matter, in lots of films. However, the acting is good and it is entertaining to see the well-worn plot revised."
4,Jigsaw Puzzle,"I do jigsaw puzzles on a regular basis. This puzzle was part of a three-puzzle package at a special price. It is colorful, the picture is interesting. The pieces are of varying shapes. It is 500 pieces, rectangular with four borders. It was challenging for me without being terribly frustrating (I am not an expert at jigsaws, I just like to do them.) The pieces are on the small side. I enjoyed the process and may order from the company again."
3,Tribal Poetry?,Love the first two songs! I didn't realize that I was getting a poetry CD though which is fine but I was really wanting to use the CD for my Yoga Class. But half the CD is the same songs just instrumental. The third song also confused me because I asumed it would be more tribal drumming sounds. I am enjoying never-the-less.
5,A Feast for the Ears!,"This CD is fantastic! John's poetry speaks to the human experience. Several phrases really ""struck a chord"" with me. In addition to the thought-provoking poetry, the music is awesome. The intricate rhythms develop and change with each song. John uses several culturally diverse instruments to create a sound that is truly a feast for the ears. ""Drum Poetry"" offers music to dance or do yoga to, or to simply ""chill out"" to. It is definitely a CD worth adding to your music collection."
3,Cheap but...,"I was so surprised that the price is so cheap. When I open the mail, I found it says ""the DVD belongs to xxx public Library"". I was so confused :("
3,book,"The item came in with a little more damage then advised, but all in all still a very good purchase."
3,For newly diagnosed thyroid patients,"This book is a good read for those newly diagnosed to thyroid disease. It offers the basic information on thyroid disease (Are you hyper or hypo, symptoms, medication, etc.) without overwhelming the reader. The author is very precise in her explanations also. For those of you looking for answers to more challenging and complex thyroid problems, this would NOT be the book to buy. It doesn't challenge any of the current practices and assumes that you have a simple problem that one pill will cure."
2,Too Basic,"This book is far too basic, with information easily found by a quick internet search. Scarce on facts and high on opinion, this book was clearly written with someone unfamiliar with medicine but with marketing savvy."
2,Disappointed,"I was disaapointed with the content of the book. I was hoping for something that was much more cutting edge, not just the basic mainstream medical community approach. While it is great to see all of the hormones discussed, it didn't go far enough for me."
3,Nothing new here,"Why did McGraw-Hill publish this book? It is almost identical (verbatim) to The Complete Thyroid Book except that the latter book includes some additional information. Both books were published in 2005.I agree with the reviewers that mention how basic this book is. If you're new to learning about thyroid conditions and their treatment, The Complete Thyroid Book is a good starting point. Otherwise check out this book or The Complete Thyroid Book from the library and maybe you'll discover a few helpful tidbits."
5,excellent product. easy install,This kit was super easy to install. I replaced a regular 4 wire connector. This now makes the trailer brake lights work.
5,On the wild side...,"Join Jeff Corwin as he shows us the dry, hot desert of Arizona, the life and death struggle in southeastern Africa, the rain forests of Costa Rica, and the grasslands of the Venezuela. Along the way we learn about life, death, love, and the web of nature. He also pops in facts and short stories, many of which are as funny as you can get without a Nun's outfit, a donkey and a jar of peanut butter.The book itself is a lovely hardcover, with full color photos and something I would be proud to have on my coffee table if I had a coffee table. And it is so enjoyable to read you could easily finish it in a day if you wanted to."
4,good introduction to Sumerian literature,This book helped me to understand better some of the earliest literature so far discovered. It is very well thought out and gives good descriptions of the context and the difficulties of translating the cuniform tablets. The side-by-side Sumerian and translation add to the interest in reading these tales from the time of the earliest cities and a completely polytheistic world model. It is remarkable to me that some of the 'simple' things we understand today were such mysteries and fraught with gods of the gaps in that time and place. Even more so the difference in knowledge between this literature and that of the Greeks and Romans only 2000 years later. I recommend this book to anyone who is curious about the early history of our civilization.
1,Overpriced,"After reading the two reviews, I purchased it and was I ever disappointed! It's nothing more than an overpriced, lightweight plastic trash can with a poorly designed plastic can crusher on top. A horrible value and wish I had not purchased."
5,Wish I'd had it years ago,"I bought the EZ Can Crusher and Recycler 4 years ago. I love it. Wish I'd had it for longer than the 4 yrs. I have. It's easy to crush the cans flat, and they fall right into the collection bin. I have the bin lined with a plastic garbage bag, so all I have to do is pull the bag, close it and off to the recycle center I go. No mess. For years I used a can crusher mounted on a post on the patio, and had to crush the can then drop in a plastic garbage bag, then move the bag to an out of the way location and do the process all over again until I had the bag full. No more. This unit is all self contained. Hard plastic receptable, easy to clean, durable. If this one ever wears out, I'd definitely want another."
3,"Good, but not the Original Broadway","The original broadway cast is much better than this album. In the original it really was hippies and so on, in this album its just actors and it really shows."
3,Good coverage of topics - plenty of mistakes,"I bought this book to get a clear picture of what .NET has in terms of thread support. This book gives you that. It is reasonably well written, but the editors have failed badly because there are numerous typographical mistakes and inconsistencies between the text and the quoted code examples.Alan succeeds in getting the ideas across, but unfortunately the examples that can be downloaded from the web site are tough to find because the directory structure of the downloaded code does not correctly match the sections in the text that it is supposed to match to.I'd definitely still recommend getting the book. It should be mandatory reading for anyone switching to .NET programming, especially VB people who typically are not experienced with real enterprise application development."
4,Good overview,"I have done a lot of Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP) work in Win32 and I was looking for a text that would show me the classes and design patterns used to build multi-threaded applications in the .NET Framework. This book was quite good for that purpose. If I had no exposure to multi-threaded programming prior to reading this book, I still think I would have found it very useful and probably a bit more challenging. This book has plenty of C# and VB.NET examples. However, as a veteran C++ programmer, I don't read VB.NET all that well (because it looks so clunky) so I found myself wishing that each example was shown fully in both languages as some other .NET books are beginning to do. Other than that, I recommend this one for anyone who wants to build robust, multi-threaded .NET applications. The author's language and approach to the material are both very good."
2,"Good for the very religious, but not for the rest of us","A TON of the quotes in this book are religious in nature--whether they be bible verses, quotes about ""god in christ,"" about faith, praying, etc, etc! As an Atheist, I didn't appreciate having so many religious quotes in what is billed as just a book of quotes on ""Wisdom."" And they aren't only in one section of the book, but ALL OVER--in the sections about art, nature, love and friendship, conscience, etc! I feel like a ""bait and switch"" was pulled on me, and that this book should be advertised as a religious quote book. So I'd say buy it if you're religious and draw your inspiration from religion, but not if you aren't/don't."
2,Blah,Not great...I like these guys but this disk not all that good. I know very early stuff - but still not great.
3,This is so cool!!!!!!!!!!!,This is so cool!!!!!!!!!!!! I love it. I think everyone should have it. It is a ***** star toy. Trust me. Kids..... Buy it for yourself or get your parents to.
4,Its ok.,"I think that this thing is pretty cool, but it does die kind of quickly and I think it needs a few more games. So if you only play it when youre bored, its really fun and offers somethin to do on long trips."
2,Not Fun!!!!,The Neopets collection is not as good as it seems. You could only play a few games and you cannot do as many things on it compared to the neopets website. this toy is not educational because it doesnt teach you anything and it isnt fun to play with. You play with it only a few days and then you get tired of playing with it that you just leave it hanging around. I dont recommend this toy for anybody.
3,Neopets are cool!,"I don't own a Pocket Neopet, but I really want one. I have always loved Neopets ever since I started playing on the website two years ago. I always wanted to be able to take my Neopets wherever I went and now I can! At first I was happy that they were making plushies,and then the voice activated pets, and now the best thing is the Pocket Neopet. I would recomend this toy to all the people on the Neopets website."
2,Aisha Pocket Neopet,"I bought one a few days ago. It has already 'left' me three times. Once was after a few hours while I was trying to feed it. It seems really buggy, my items keep disappearing, and sometimes it doesn't reward the neopoints. I'm going to be taking it back, and wouldn't recommend it to anybody who's frustrated easily."
5,Neopets,I luv Neopets but Kougra is not my favorite pet - the Lupe is my favorite pet. It is pernounced loop
5,"A Must Read on the Whole ""Bible-Homo"" Question","Professor Long provides a much needed and long awaited treatment of homosexuality in religious perspectives. His focus on the issues of ""gender-threat"" and its relation to why some religions are antagonistic to male homosexuality is right on target. He combines his knowledge of religious traditions with a cultural eye that gives the reader tremendous insight. I devoured this book, as should anyone interested in the whole ""bible-homo"" question."
3,LOUD,IZ is very loud. I put my iZ in the kitchen and I can hear it in my room(upstairs). (...) sometimes I think this is annoying.
3,This product does not function as it states,This product is great if you want to see it light up and play its tunes. It does not move or dance like it is marketed.
1,The Devil,"When I turned 12, 5 years ago, I received the iZ on Christmas from my aunt and at first I thought this would be really cool. Oh how wrong I was. First and foremost it does not turn off, even at the age of 17 I still cannot figure out how to turn this contraption off. It basically plays the same looped annoying beat for hours on end while adding even more mind-numbing effects into the mix. This leads me into my next point: the sound effects and ""voice"" of this demonic figure can induce many nightmares. Honestly, this ""voice"" is so soul crushing I would rather be deaf then have to listen to this toy speak and/or make noise. This toy has fallen from my shelf several times over the years and it literally takes me hours to turn off. This toy should be avoided at all cost because it is a perpetual, annoying toy that only plays infuriating effects over a terrible looped beat."
3,ITS A BUMP ON A LOG,I always try to write truthful descriptions as I sometimes buy things wishing I had listened to other ratings.First this is surprisingly bigger than the picture BUT ITS POINTLESS the eyes move up and down but barely. It does not move on its own so if you think its going to move from leg to leg it does not you have to move it yourself from one leg or to make it stand on both legs. The sound clarity is very poor the light show it gives is fair but it does not do things on is own as much as you would expect it to for this price.I am very surprised that this thing got such a high rating from usa today or any consumer reporting agency I can see this thing going on sale once they realize its WAY over priced! TRUST ME
2,"If you can't understand it, you're lucky!!","My step-mom decided to waste money not once, but twice, getting one for my 6yo brother, and 5yo nephew...both of them(the blue one) if you press it's stomach right say, and I quote:""It's time to get f*cked up!""That is not appropriate for kids at all, and we will be seeking legal advice on this toy!"
2,Wasent the best,i am 9 years old.This Iz thing isent great .Once i tested it out and when u make a mix in DJ mode the IZ is (lol Iz and is)really making the music and u are just making a bubble sound.The only reson i really like it is becasue it makes songs from to ipod to hear out loud.I rather get a I-Dog if i were u.My mom said this thing would dance and i got very exieted.But it is the worst.
3,Not Emilio Navaira- it's Mingo Saldivar,"Be careful when making a purchase on this product. It is not Emilio. Mingo Saldivar is the ""Dancing Cowboy""...it's Mingo's cd. FYI- I only chose 3 stars because I had to choose a rating. Advising the buyer of the actual artist who performs on the cd was my only intention.Thanks,Joe C.TruBluTejano"
4,gone but not forgotten,"Dishing out heavy doses of moral philosophy, McDonald always keeps the reader entertained and thought provoked. Not quite on par with some of the earlier McGee's, but never-the-less, vintage McDonald. 30+ years of reading his novels, one can only morn the loss that Travis, Meyer and the rest won't have a new tale to tell."
1,Worst Travis MsGee,I agree with the other two star reviewer for this book. Nothing seems real or convincing in this work. If this had been the first MacDonald book I read I would not have read another.The plot read like the cheap 60's motorcycle themed movies the book kept discussing. I didn't believe any of it. Travis reluctant to grieve over a woman he knew that was brutally murdered because he couldn't focus in on her personality just amazed me.Even if you're addicted to the series as I am; don't read this one!
3,The work of a master...,"#19 on the list of 21 Travis McGee novels, ""Free Fall"" was published just 5 years before the author's death in 1986. While the book is more refined from a technical standpoint than previous offerings, the characters, especially Meyer, have lost some of their luster. This McGee is a step slower, more willing to accept help. He has evolved from a rambunctious cowboy into a more pensive, cautious person. MacDonald was the master of climax, and Free Fall is consistent. Abrupt and violent, you are almost left wondering, ""What just happened?"" A great read for a rainy day."
3,Not In The Top Tier,"I always thought ""Crimson"" was one of the weakest of the McGee books. I am a big fan of John D. MacDonald but few things in this book hang together. The author thought ""Indigo"" was a failure but ""Indigo"" was better than this novel.The plot doesn't really ring true and some of the incidents don't either. It's one of the few times in a MacDonald novel that I will read a scene and say, ""Wait a minute...""Not every novel is a success but I thought both this book and ""Cinnamon Skin"", written after ""Crimson"" were among the weakest of the series. Then MacDonald bounced back with ""The Lonely Silver Rain."" By all means read the book if you are a McGee fan but know it's not the best."
4,This is a very good coming-of-age movie,"I was surprised when I saw this movie because it was the first good Juliette Lewis I'd seen. I enjoyed the film very much. It was excellent. I thought the some of the more outre discussions between the kids were a little inappropriate, but all in all, the movie was pretty impressive. and Eliza Dushku really stole the show with her amazing debut. Worth the watch."
4,THAT NIGHT,"THIS MOVIE IS GREAT! IT TELLS ABOUT ALOT OF IMPORTANT VIEWS. I LIKE WATCHING IT 2 A YEAR. BUT, I THINK JUST ABOUT EVERYONE CAN RELATE TO THIS MOVIE. A LITTLE YOUNG ROMANCE, WITH A NEIGHBOOR RIVAL!!"
5,Great coming-of-age movie,"I've been a fan of Eliza Dushku for years. When I first heard about this film, I just had to check it out. I think C. Thomas Howell and Juliette Lewis had a great chemistry. It's one of Juliette's best role. I can't believe how cute Eliza was when she was 10. For her first film she did an incredible job. One bad thing about this movie is that is not on DVD. This movie is worth watching."
5,DVD Release,For several years I have been constantly checking to see if this movie has come out on DVD yet. Who do we even contact to put in the request?!? I would love this movie on DVD!!!!
4,Resurrection Day: A fantastic novel of what could have been,"Resurrection Day is a great book, even though I did have a hard time finding it. Evidently, it's little-known, despite the fact that Brendan DuBois received an award and much critical praise for Resurrection Day. For anyone who likes the alternate history genre, this book is a must-have. For anyone who's interested in thrillers in general, this book is a must-have."
4,Good Alertative HIstory.......,An oft time time spooky alternative history of a world where the Cuban Missile Crisis ended in war.The story of a newpaper reporter while in the process of reporting on just another murder stumbles across clues to the biggest secret known. There are those that will pay any price to keep him from unraveling the truth.
2,"Interesting Premise, Predictable Plot","This novel is an interesting concept, but is done in by a completely predictable climax that you can smell before the book is barely a third over because once again, JFK hagiography must ultimately rule the day. All one has to do is substitute the name of Curtis LeMay for the novel's ""Ramsay Curtis"" and you know right away how things have to turn out. I have seen this cliche hashed out time and again in other alternate history novels like ""Promises Kept"" in which no one can ever point to any flaw in the leadership of JFK, or that he would have been the savior of America and never done any wrong, and the end result is still utterly banal and predictable."
2,Something to read while waiting for a plane or train,"Fairly decent ""junk"" reading, full of cliches (e.g. news reporter uncovering sinister conspiracies; romance between reporter and predictably beautiful, spunky, and mysterious female correspondent), and simplistic characterizations (e.g. the Globe's military censor is downright demonic, with no redeeming attributes at all). Best part of the book is its description of the hypothetical Cuban War, and its immediate aftermath as America gradually withdraws from the world scene (some sections are absolutely chilling). Unfortunately, the plot steadily unravels as it plods its way to the disappointingly predictable conclusion (which any half-intelligent reader will figure out by the first 1/3 of the book). Furthermore, too much of the story is derivative of Harris' Fatherland. But JFK adorers, former hippies clinging to the 1960s, and anyone who loses sleep over the possibility that the Redcoats will one day reconquer America will surely love the novel."
5,A must for any serious alternative history buffs.,"I have a collection of over 6,000 books,and I have to say that this book is the best book I've read in ten years!It is absolutely riveting.Be prepared to read it one go,you won't be able to put it down."
2,War Day revisited No Way,I am very disapointed with this story that the material was there to make this a fine epic but fell short of the likes of War Day now unavailable. You would get to parts of the story and feel like you where plowing uphill and getting no where but the promise of it might get better is a hope I was looking for and found some good quility gems in amongist some rough uncut stone possabily.
2,"oh, the politics!!","Mr. DuBois has a reasonable command of the English language and manages to spin a tale that, under different circumstances, might be interesting. However, the unrelenting political thrust of the novel, given life by the sensitive / tough-guy / ex-army protagonist, becomes very quickly annoying. I won't mention which way the author leans - that is unimportant - but will say that the apparent assumption by him that everyone thinks as he does leaves a bad taste in this reader's mouth."
3,okish,"Great idea, but not greatly written. Several phrases are used over and over in the dialog. Too many coincidental links lessen the believability as well."
3,An enjoyable mystery in alternative timeline.,An enjoyable mystery set in an alternative timeline where the Cuban Missile Crisis got out of hand. Nuclear war breaks out and the USSR takes out 4 major cities plus some military bases. The US wipes out the USSR.It is now 10 years later and the US is beginning to come out of its economic crisis when a reporter is pulled off a routine murder case of an old veteran due to national security. The old vet had some secret papers and the reporter wants to know what it's all about.
4,Good beach book; when's the HBO movie coming out?,"This book was a fun read that moved along briskly. I was one of millions of very scared pre-adolescents during the Cuban missle crisis. Much of the well researched ""alternative history"" seemed all too plausible back then, especially to folks such as myself who lived near ground zero of a major SAC base.True, the plot of the book (and ultimate conclusion) was a bit predictable, and some of the characterizations were extremely one dimensional - but for light summer reading, you can't beat this novel.And here's the best endorsement I can give ""Resurrection Day"": I look forward to the author's next effort."
3,A different kind of apocalyptic novel,"An interesting ""what if"" novel dealing with the cuban missel crisis, what if things had turned out differently and the soviet union and the u.s. went to war. At least that is the premise of the novel, it's setting.What the story really is is part love story, part espionage story. Dubois keeps the story moving with various turns in the plot and some interesting background story as to what it is like in this alternate world. He creates likeable, believable characters. It's good for some light reading."
3,alternate history as liberal parable,"The escalation of the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis into a brief, one-sided nuclear war is the founding premise of this noirish alternate-history, which adopts elements of both Philip K. Dick's ""The Man in the High Castle"" and Whitley Streiber's ""Warday"" into its own slightly-weird liberal parable. The ghoulish entertainment includes an unguided tour of a radiated Manhattan ghost town (inhabited by subterranean Democrats) as well as glimpses of a stagnant post-war milieu governed by the fussy military censors of a thinly-disguised Gen. Curtis LeMay."
3,"Great ideas, poor delivery","Resurrection Day is set in a world in which the Cuban Missle Crisis turned into a full scale nuclear war between The Soivet Union and the US. The Soviet Union is totally destroyed while the US is severly crippled. The story revolves around a reporter, Carl Landry,who investigates the murder of an old veteran who has information on the true events which occured leading up to the nuclear exchange. What he finds out has vital importance to the upcoming Presidential election and the freedom of the American people. The ideas Brendan Dubois explores such as how the use of ""emergency powers"" can lead to governmental opression is interesting, but character development is lacking. This, coupled with a rushed ending makes this book less then what it could have been."
5,Resurrection Indeed,"Although it starts off a bit meandering, Resurrection Day quickly builds into a book difficult to put down. There are two phenomenal stories here. One is what if the Cuban Missile Crisis had turned into WWIII? The other is what the US might be like as a 3rd world nation. Both are compelling.DuBois writes engaging characters and fills his plot with enough turns to make a Ballerina tipsy. I repeatedly tried to geuss the ending, and even the next page, and was always stymied. The conversations flow convincingly, and the story is a joy to read.Here we are given a look at how Americans are like the rest of the world. If you strip them of the technological advantage, and the moral advantage of a well-constructed constitution that is actually followed, they respond like everyone else. Not badly, not well- just as humans, struggling to survive."
3,"A good Airplane Read, but not as shattering as expected","""Resurrection Day"" kept me interested throughout, but I must admit that it's depiction of America in 1972 post WW III didn't ring quite true to me. If you're an alternate history fan, or interested in the Cuban Missle Crisis, then this is a worthy read, but that's not to say that it was ~completely~ satisfying (but then few books are).Although ""devastated America"" kept being alluded to, it never quite came to life for me. Carl's daily life seems fairly ordinary, and affected only in small ways. This might indeed have been the case if the war happened in '62, since the world wasn't as wired and thus as fragile at that time, but even so, I expected more ~""Alternativeness""~ in his world than I found.For those that might feel similarly, I recommend the book ""Warday"", which was published back in about 83-84. ""Postman"" by David Brin, a great book and not-so-great movie also explores the same genre in a surprisingly effective (and affecting) way."
3,Great Premise; Mediocre Pay-off,"Wonderful premise and the allusions to Fatherland are apt. However, the love story seemed obligatory, at best, and the events at the end which led to the invasion being called off were far too insignificant not to logically have been ignored by the would-be invaders."
1,Resurection Day,"How many of other readers purchased this book and got to page 277 and found the pages blank to 477? The store it was purchased at was going to just exchange it however in review of the 5 they had in stock, all had the same blank pages. The store then refunded my money. The book was great up until then."
5,very nice,"estos zapatos son realmente bellos y comodos...la flexibilidad, adicionalmente el envio fue realmente rapido y seguro.recomiendo ampliamente la compra de este producto.muchas gracias"
3,Not Sure if this is ORIGINAL,"I have recived the converse shoe yesterday.. opened the box and took a close look at them, really do not like the finish and they really do not look original to me. i am thinking of returnig them"
2,Beware,"I've been wearing Chucks for years now, but the pair that I purchased from shoezoo fell apart after 2 months. The sole of the shoe completely ripped off the rest of the shoe, and I've only used these shoes for casual walking. Pretty ridiculous."
4,Converse Shoes,Now that my daughter has received the correct size the sneakers are perfect. I had no bad experience with this vendor. Keep up the good work.
4,Smooth exchange,"I had the experience of having to exchange these shoes. It was fairly simple and I had no issues. I ordered them as a Christmas present for my daughter. They arrived fairly quickly in the mail. Though we ordered her normal size, they were about 1/2 size too large. So I followed the online instructions and sent them back for an exchange. I received a replacement in just a little over a week. I was impressed with the quick turnaround. The only drawback is that I had to pay to ship them back and also include a check for $7.99 to cover shipping of the new shoes."
2,Glue failing,"Good looking shoes, but...after just 1 month,the glue is failing at the edge of the shoe where the foot bends. The shoe still looks perfect, but I had to use shoe goo to fix it. Seems like for the price, and for as long as this style has been around it shouldn't so this?!"
3,Unsure,"I just got these in the mail today, and I am unsure as to whether or not these shoes are legit. Although they came in a box, the shoes did not come with the ""Converse Chuck Taylor"" tags that usually come with the product. There are also some minor cosmetic issues (the stitching near the toe area of the shoes are uneven). Also, the label inside the tongue says that these shoes were made in Indonesia. The Converse that I used to wear were either made in China or Vietnam."
3,Bigger than you think,"I usually wear a 10.5 in most shoes, including Vans, which are my normal brand. The 10.5 Chucks that arrived are almost a whole size larger than what i'm used to. They are more like 11.5 They fit fine width wise, but my toe barely reaches the white rubber in the front. So word of advice, order a size smaller than you think."
2,Should include how to order Converse sizes,"Got her fast, but shoes are to big and it will cost me more money to send them back and then receive them back. There should be a note on how to order Converse. One size smaller than your original foot size. Now I am dealing with shoes that are to big."
5,Old School meets New School,"This purchase was another gift for Christmas. I bought this particular pair of shoes for my wife. Although it was not a direct Amazon.com purchase and I was redirected to another site, the process was easy. The shoes were shipped fast and on time, there was great communication from the site that sold them. Another great purchase!"
5,good shoe,I bought these for a gift. The recipient loved them. Apparently it is hard to find the half sizes in stores with this shoe. No complaints with these.
3,Not bad,"For the price these were good converse that lasted a little over a year and a half (I wore them a lot). The one thing I noticed is that when they arrived they smelled like spray paint and over time as the black faded it started to look like a dark green. Not that bad, but something to take into consideration."
2,These Fell Apart!,"My son wore these off and on for a month when school started. Both shoes, the soles started to come off. The right one came off almost completely. Don't know if this was just a bad pair or what but I wouldn't order these particular Converse shoes again."
3,make sure to order the right item,"I love these shoes. However, I ordered the wrong size and exchanging them has been a hassle. It has been over a month and I do not have the shoes or the money and no one can seem to help me."
4,Awesome look,My only probelm with these shoes are that they are not comfortable at all. do buy some type of inserts..
5,love,love these shoes. no trouble with purchase. fit just perfect. love these shoes. love this brand. love this color. love
3,Strange fit,"I usually get the more target brand converse in a size 8, which fit great, but when I ordered these in a size 8 they were uncomfortable. They felt just slightly too big and didn't fit well around my foot, I don't think ordering a half size down would have helped. I tried to break them in, but they gave me blisters, twice!"
3,three star i can give,"It is ok for this price. But after 2 months, there are small holes on the bottom of shoes.But after 2 months, there are small holes on the bottom of shoes."
1,at least they came somewhat white,I've never wrote a review about any product. I'm usually satisfied. This however kind of ticked me off. The shoe had some weird stain on it when i first saw them. they were also not the right size. I ended up giving them away.
3,Acceptable quality,"I don't think that these shoes are original converse ,but in any case the quality is acceptable and they are true to size.It seems that one can not get original stuff these days."
5,Good choice for the price,An Excelent choice. They are very good for everyday use. Accesible price. I am very satisfied and I recommend it.
5,So very black,"I own 5 pairs of Converse sneaks, my daughter has 3 pairs, and my son has 2 pairs. We all really love our Chucks. But this is my first pair of the low top kind. I love them so much. They are really comfortable and easy to slip on and off, and so very black so they go with any kind of casual clothing well.If you're buying Converse for the first time, be aware they run just a touch big. This is wonderful for my son who has fairly wide feet, but the rest of us usually buy a half size small."
4,Might Be Worth It,"I was very pleased to get these shoes, they're very iconic no matter where you go and look great with just about any casual outfit. But after about 10 months of having these, rips between the rubber parts of the shoe and the cloth began to seperate. I'm not sure whether this is due to how my feet fit within the shoe. After trying to fix the seams myself, the shoes soon began to just fall apart really and just became really unwearable. If they were cheaper I would consider getting a second pair and maybe another different pair of shoes along with them. Overall they're still nice shoes, but they may need to be pampered somewhat for them to last a long time."
5,the always faithful converse chuck taylor,"i said the always fauthful converse 'cause its simply the best shoe i ever had, they gimme all the confort that i need to walk very much!!!! i mean walk A LOT!!!!"
2,Xmas top wish list item that cannot be worn...,"was gonna mark this one star...the size was miss-leading, and too large for my daughter to wear. She really, really wanted these, was soooo excited when she opened them. One full size, or more, too large, maybe men's vs. women's? Miss-marked? Now what? There they sit in her room until I can fix the problem. But...the quality was very nice, shipped well, all that. SO, two stars."
3,nice but too big,"It is true that they come larger than the regular size. They are comfortable casual shoes but would recommend them for long walks, they give me blisters."
3,"Look cool, but","I think Chuck's look cool, which is why I bought these, but I had no idea they were so uncomfortable. If you can deal with a shoe that has almost no cushion and no arch, then by all means get them (I still wear them every once in a while). But if comfort is a big thing to you, I would look elsewhere."
5,Nice shoes,I ordered these and when I got them they were everything I thought they would be. I love em!
4,CONVERSE,THE SHOES WERE A CHRISTMAS PRESENT FOR MY DAD. HE IS OLD SKOOL TO SAY THE LEAST. THE SHOES WERE LIKE PEOPLE BUYING THROWBACK JERSEYS. HE HAS NOT HAD ANY COMPLAINT ABOUT THE SHOES. TRUST ME THE SHOES HAVE GOT TO BE COMFORTABLE OR THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN RETUTNED INSTANTLY.
5,great!,"a great shoe, buy a size below what you usually wear. comfy, durable and a great casual look with jeans."
2,Not for me,"I'm accustomed to Dansko, Sanita, and Allegria shoes, which are all very comfortable, but require a break in period. I'm ok with that. But these never seemed to get broken in. Maybe my feet are just used to soles on my regular brands. I'm on my feet 9 hours a day, on concrete, walking around and up and down stairs, for several miles a day, sometimes with long periods standing (I'm an adult-education instructor). I have heard so many great things about chucks and really wanted a different shoe I could wear from time to time, and was hoping these would be it. I wear a 10 (40) in women's and the 8.5 chucks fit my foot well (thankful I read the other reviews and knew what size to order) but they just aren't the shoe for me."
1,Very Disappointed,I was very disappointed when I got this sneaker. The soles were very thin and theentire sneaker was very flimsy.I returned it but had to absorb about $25 in shipping costs.
3,"Runs big, beautiful design and color!","Bought this for my cousin, he said it an big about half to a whole size. He's an 8.5 and i bought him the 8.5 and its big on him but he was fine with it since he wears thick socks anyway. The color black was really nice and the design as well. As for the quality, can't speak for it right now since we just got it but so far upon close inspection when i got the shoes, it look durable and made well so hopefully it'll last long."
3,Payin' for the Name?,I had to get these for a wedding. Let's just say technology has made more modern shoes more comfortable. Liked 'em more when I was 8.
5,love em,"Converse are great for your feet. They contain little padding, so you maintain a natural walking motion. Its basically one step above being barefoot. I actually use them to weight train. They are also very stylish. Who doesn't love converse?"
4,Great Sneaker,"I bought this Converse sneaker in black. These All Star sneakers look stylish and good with any casual pants I own. I would have given the product 5 stars, EXCEPT, these shoes are like walking on bricks since they have no cushion in the soles for the heels. I understand they're supposed to have the whole classic appeal... but if you're over 30 years old and try to rock a pair of Converse for an entire day, you may encounter some uncomfortable lower back pain. So 4 stars for fashion."
5,Haley's shoes,"These were a purchase for my 13 year old granddaughter. Although I have not physically seen them because they live in VA and I in MN, she tells me that they are just what she wanted. Pleased with the ease of this transaction and the speed in which they were shipped to her. Thank you."
5,converse all star,"great product, just as advertised. The item was purchased at a good price and the shipping was fast. I would purchase from this person again. they come highly recommended.thanksusm1975black"
5,Classic,Chucks rock! Got these to match with my 2 and 4 year old boys. They love when we all put our chucks on together. These never go out of style.
4,nice and confort,"nice and confort but bigger than real size.maybe is because they are men shoes.anyway, they were enough confortable to use in daily life."
4,Love them,"I've been looking for red chucks for a while now. I love these!! I would recommend getting a half size to a full size smaller though, they run quite large."
5,Converse All Stars rock!,"I have been wearing all stars for way to long now, and these are just as good as I remember. These shoes are iconic, we all know how good these are, the oxfords are a great change of pace from my high tops. These shoes will never go out style!"
4,Mix-up,"Shoes arrived in wonderful shape; packaged well; exactly what I ordered.However, we ordered the wrong size. Return went well; advised my account would be credited for purchase price only; but there was no stock available nor could they tell me when they would receive more in the size we needed. If you need a specific size, order it ASAP."
5,Perfect fit one size smaller,"I purchased some Converse Mens Chuck Taylor Sneaker from another store because they had some specials going on and I also had some coupons so I purchased them in the size I have always worn, size 9. Then I try them and wow way too big, felt like a clown at the gym :)I can fit a whole finger in the back of the shoe with my foot in it. Anyway I did some research here on Amazon and bought pair from Amazon, a size 8 and wow !!! I can't believe it Perfect fit, I was about to buy half size smaller but I went with the whole one size smaller instead and I'll say it again PERFECT FIT :)Buy one size smaller ,quality is amazing"
3,Not good quality anymore.,"I LOVE the style of Converse, always have. But the quality of the shoe is going down :(. I have had my black pair (They look just like the ones in the pic) for about 2 years now, and they're pretty much starting to fall apart already. I dont even wear them everyday! Very disappointed in the quality nowadays, but they are still stylish. (Until they fall apart)"
2,Converse are 2 sizes larger than the labeled size.,"Watch out, Converse are 2 sizes larger than the labeled size. We ended up giving them away, my son is size 11 and they fit his size 13 friend perfectly."
2,Not satisfied,"The product itself was fine but because the item was the wrong size, I had to return for a credit or an exchange. It cost almost ten dollars to return the item after originally spending about six or seven dollars for shipping and handling. If I understand your policy, and you have the correct size and ship that, I will pay another six or seven dollars for shipping. That means for a purchase of about forty dollars, I have paid almost twenty four dollars extra. I would never purchase another clothing item from [...]."
2,wrong size,heard converse shoes were hard to size up. wrong no biggie still like them cant afford now. oh well not ur fault
1,Poorly Made,"I was so happy to get a pair of these shoes, until the second day I had them part of the seam ripped. Go figure with the poorly made stitching. I've never had a pear of shoes last only one day. I can't believe I wasted my money on this. I've had Wal-Mart shoes last longer than these. 365 times longer than these shoes. WTF"
4,Comfortable and Stylish,"My daughter shamed me into wearing these comfortable and stylish shoes, claiming that I was ""dated"" in wearing my regular running shoes. They are comfortable and I receive many compliments."
5,Came on time.,"I ordered these sneakers for my cousin. He loves them! Great pair of basic sneakers that blends well with any outfit. Great decision, rather than over priced sneakers!"
2,Ripped less than a year later with minimal use,"I wore these shoes to the gym (powerlifting requires flat soles) no more than 4 times a week for 3 hours at a time. After 9 months I was sliding the heal on and the seam ripped (on the opening, between the toe and heal, inside edge).Guess I'll skip the lo top next time."
2,Linen Chef Jacket,"This chef coat is very, very large (I ordered a med.) if you are a ladies size 16 or larger this may fit you -- but the coat has no shaping whatsoever -- so you will look like a big marshmallow (mine is white) -- also, where the collar meets at the neck has a very large space -- which is not traditional and looks very odd. The fabric quality is OK, which for the price is not so great. Perhaps this was cut for men, but the buttons and fabric would make it too girly. This coat design needs to be amended and shaped and the overlap (where the buttons cross over) needs to be re-thought as the fabric hangs down and bunches under the coat -- so the bottom hem is not 'clean' -- it needs a button underneeth or something to stop that from happening."
4,Linen Chef Jacket,As a home chef and someone who loves entertaining it was fun to get the complements from our guests about my jacket. Not only was the meal special but so was I.
1,A great disservice.,"While Shaw may have been a gifted playwright, his ""Saint Joan"" did an enormous disservice to the subject: the view it presents of Joan of Arc conflicts with the historical evidence on nearly every point, echoing instead the propaganda of her enemies. In truth, her trial was orchestrated by the English and their clerical allies (and even Shaw admits that the Inquisition overturned the verdict in 1456, shortly after the English were finally driven out of Rouen); nor was Joan a ""rebel"" except in the minds of her political opponents. By dredging up this fraudulent view of La Pucelle, Shaw's play was among the first popular works to undermine the efforts of countless scholars whose research had brought a more truthful view of the issue to light. For an historically accurate version, I would recommend any book by Regine Pernoud, many of which are offered here at Amazon."
1,Don't waste your time,"The book starts well( first 20 pages). However, the writing switches from overloaded sentences, to very basic prose all over the place. The author leaves you wondering why the relationship betwen Marc and Uva is so strong.Why does Marc go in search for her. Would not a foreigner taht has been attacked leave the country? And then magicaly Uva appears in the last chapter out of nowhere.Do not waste your time reading this novel."
3,Just Revenge,This was a good and concise publication in opposition to capital punishment. It presented good arguments from various angles as to why the death penalty should be abolished. It would definitely be a great tool in a college classroom.
3,tinkerbell candle,"The candle is a very cute but like all the other times that i've bought this item ,it came with a broken wing.I always have to fix the wings with crazy glue. I keep ordering the candle because its so pretty but i have never received it unbroken."
4,My Daughter loved it,"My Daughter loves Tink, and we wanted to find a larger candle for her birthday cake. This one worked great. It is a good size, and has good color to it. It doesn't look overly cheap like some that I've seen. Due to shape and thickness, it would be pretty easy for this to break during shipping but mine did not."
1,BUYER BEWARE- does not ship well,This is one of the cutest Tinker Bell candles I could find. I couldn't wait to put it on my daughters Birthday cake. However the 1st one I received had a broken wing. So I contacted CS and they sent me a replacement. But when The 2nd one arrived with a broken wing as well I was very disappointed. When I contacted CS regarding the 2nd candle it was recommended I not have a 3rd one sent (since they don't seem to ship well). So although I received a full refund... I still have no Tinker Bell candle. Buyer beware- This item is fragile and may arrive broken.
5,My distant cousin,"I loved this book, because it is about a relative I had never met. I have met his son, tho"
2,Too over the top,"Having read every single book in the Gor series, I can honestly say that this is the only one of the early books that I don't like, and can't re-read. Norman does best when the physical action is coming at you fast and furious; not so good when the only action taking place involves complex human interactions.Not only are many of the scenes way over the top, but there were too many characters to keep track of. At times, Tarl Cabot gets lost in the storyline. I simply didn't care enough about many of the minor characters to want to hear much about them.I think it was just a bit too ambitious an undertaking for Norman, and it didn't play into his strengths as a writer. Fortunately, this is the last book of this type."
4,Not as good as Nomads but still a great book,"I missed the humor of Nomads but I loved the deviant, Cernus. The man was beyond evil. How did Norman even dream up the slaves that were raised never having laid eyes on a man? A wicked, wicked mind maybe? Still, it was very interesting to read and find out their fate at the end of the book. There was a little too much detail sometimes and yes, there were a few ""over-the-top"" chapters but it was still a very fun read."
4,Jeff is sorta right,"Assasin leads to 4 to7 more books which develop the Kurii vs Priest Kings theme. If you don't read them in order, you may be lost. Each book refers in the opening pages to several events in preceding books. The references are vague, but tie in very well if you read previous books. Among the first five books, this one rates high. With later books Norman dives into Male/Female roles and becomes irritating. This mostly begins with the Kajira caption and Guardian trilogy. After Mercenaries, FORGET IT"
4,Exactly what I was looking for!,"I received this scale just last week, and I am happy to report that it is everything I expected. I was sick of spending money on expensive digital (inconsistent) models, that stopped working after only a year or so of use. This unit provides consistent readings at eye level. It was simple to complete assembly of the two main pieces shipped in the box, and was simple to balance (and rebalance as necessary if the scale is moved)."
2,Unreliable scale,The scale calibrates but then does not weigh accurately from one weighing to the next. I thought this was supposed to be medical grade?!?
3,2005 Nissan Titan LE,"They fit the seat okay, the order also came with some arm rest covers but my Titan does not have armrests? There is no cover for the center box as shown in the picture but it is not listed in the description either so whatever custom..."
3,books-great; seller-not so great,"Set of two booklets about difference, tolerance, and working together aimed at younger children from the Southern Poverty Law Center's Teaching Tolerance project. (Free to schools, BTW).Books were not new as advertised, but in excellent condition.One box contained 6 booklets, the other only 5.Product came quickly; no problems otherwise with seller.The stories are worth reading and would recommend without reservations."
4,Memories,just wanted to see it again after so many years. Still brings a lot of laughs. Too bad it is no longer on TV
1,awful,"the perfume came without outer plastic package, as if it had been opened before :(no date of production, no detail description (like citronelol, eugenol, coumarin etc)the paper pack (the box) was deformedvery disappointing purchase. I ordered another perfume the same time from Perfumania - all the above stated points were ok."
2,Uneven and sometimes flawed,"Listening through this survey of the Bach organ works is frustrating. It is by far the worst recorded of those available, regardless of age. In the case of familiar much recorded historical instruments such as the magnificent Freiberg Silbermann organ, it is easy to compare. I suspect it is uninspired placement of microphones that often renders the sound muddy and distant. Jacob sometimes sounds very matter of fact and occasionally downright bad. It is a sloppy production in general, for instance, on Disk 11 track 10 is not the fugue of BWV 545, it is the Largo of the Trio Sonata V! This recording should not be anyone's first choice for the repertory."

Put together very well!The goalie DVD really rocks!Soccer Coaching:Schupak's Soccer 6 Pack DVD SetFor just a few dollars you get 2 more soccer DVDs by Marty Schupak in this popular set.

2,An Alagna That We Have No Heard,Well let's start with Alagna's darkened voice. I think Roberto may be developing Carreras-Itis. This is cartainly a different sounding Roberto Alagna that I have ever heard. His middle is muddy and his top doesn't ring like in the past. I like the selection of songs including a song he wrote for this album. Not all the arrangements are tradtional (some even being on the ridiculous side) and maybe this makes his efforts a little tainted. In the liner notes Roberto comments on his approach to some of the songs. He admits he tries to sound like a pop singer (i.e. White Christmas-what a butcher job). On other songs he was a tenor. Even that doesn't add up to much. Tenor fans and Alagna fans will be very disappointed with his singing. I was. This album will let him iclude himself as one of the elading tenors in the post Domingo/Pavarotti/ and Carreras era. His Sacred Aria album is much better than this one.
5,good,"Thank you, this item was exactly what I wanted it to be. It is a good purchase on my part. thanks!"
1,hate it,I have been reading this book in my intro to native american studies.. and I hate it... I feel it give the wrong image towards northwest native history...
3,It Gets Boring After Awhile,"Do you know how some games are really fun when you get them, but then after you've played it about 5 times they're really boring and you never play them again except on occasion? That perfectly decribes this game. It's a little educational and very durable, though."
4,Pastor Blessing,Awesome book with deep revelations... If you need to know how and if God can heal you read this book.
1,Be careful scrapbookers!!! This is NOT like the original Cropper Hopper!,Be careful scrapbookers!!! This is NOT like the original Cropper Hopper! It is not deep enought to fit 12X12 paper. Don't make the same mistake I did!
1,Total Waste of Money!,"I bought this box to store my old sketchbooks in. I was misled by another reviewer who claimed that the box was dust and water-proof, THIS IS FALSE! The cover is cheap plastic that pops into the base by two bulb-shaped hinges. There are large, open gapes between the cover and the base when it's closed, offering absolutely no protection from dust and moisture whatsoever. The handles broke the first time I lifted it (cheap plug-in type connector / hinge). The only thing this box is good for is a trash-can."
1,Advantus Letter/Legal Plastic File Box.,Found another file box just as good with out the handle for only $8.00 instead of the amount Advantus. Returned the box
1,Handles break with ease,"The notch where you insert the handle will break fairly quickly. I was using this product to store wires and other small electrical tools, weighing in no more than 6 pounds. After a week of use, (and only picking up the box twice), I heard a crack and saw that a piece of the rim broke off, and now the handle does not stay in place. I can only imagine what happens when you fill up this organizer with paper, which is much more heavier and denser..."
1,Not what the title says,"I was looking for a source that would contain actual factual information on chemistry. This book is nothing but a long, absurd joke."
4,Splendeur pour l'oreille!,"Un bon album, pour ceux et celles qui veulent s'imprégner dun flux musical mélangeant la transe,l'éveil sensitif et la relaxation. Du silence aux mélodies, l'album émerveillera les auditeurs friands du nouvel ge, terme que le remplacerais volontiers par ambiant. À conseiller fortement!"
4,"A Good Read, but not Gibbons' Best Novel","I am a big Kaye Gibbons fan, but I found this book to be a little weaker than the rest. The character development (usually a Gibbons strength) was not great. The book rambled a little bit. All that being said, ""mediocre"" Kaye Gibbons writing is still phenomenal by any standard."
3,Life with Mother!,"Kaye Gibbons has long been one of my favorite writers. Whether it was reading about a young Ellen Foster dealing with her abusive father or a woman who prepares meals for her husband to eat after she dies, it is as if Ms. Gibbons characters have become cherished friends. Unfortunately, as I read the story of the Barnes family about their manic depressive mother and wife, these characters never really got under my skin. Perhaps it is my failing that I found it diffcult to read about this subject matter and that I never felt I came to know the characters but this book left me hungering for another Gibbons' title I can sink my teeth into."
4,Subtle provocation of thought...,"What makes a book 5 stars...maybe a theme that captures an era or an event in time that could stand on its own. Kaye Gibbons comes close to weaving such a story. The characters are beautifully developed and never do they overreach. Instead we have a small story that speaks twenty volumes of the forces that shape children. Maybe more importantly we are left knowing eight characters and the thirsts that are at the core of their lives. Kaye Gibbons is truly gifted in drawing the reader into complexity with a simplicity that seemingly requires little writing effort. Don't be fooled. It's almost as if, at completion, you don't even know what hit you, only that you have been hit."
2,unseen is the word,"I read this book two years ago and had the opportunity to participate in an interview with the author on National Public Radio. Ms. Gibbons was gracious, of course, but she could not answer the obvious difficulties in this book. The chronology is confused, and while the book reaches for important issues, ie the need for a young girl to have a mother, the treatment of the characters is shallow. The longing is there, and it is expressed well, but ultimately, the miraculous ""healing"" of the mother and her immediate death after her restoration--undermine whatever strength was in the novel.The one character that the reader has no trouble believing is Pearl, the caring maternal housekeeper. She is a jewel of characterization, much needed and appreciated in this novel."
2,From crazy mom to Stepford wife....which is worse,"Well I can't say that this was the best book I read. It was definately a fine book. Fine being Ok not good but not horrible. It was an easy read with nothing to miss seeing as Gibbons pushes everything down your throat. Not much thinking needed for this one. I would have liked to see more of what a child sees in a mother. Not what a commercial says one should be. If the book had gone into more depth and actualy painted the characters with lives outside of Hattie's I might have found it more interesting. For a mediocre read about woman who goes from insane woman with passions to a Stepford Wife whom Jesse Helms himself would be proud of, pick this book up. If it doesn't sound good your money is better put to laundry or a good CD."
3,limited portrayal of manic depression,"Sights Unseen is the story of a woman with manic depression and her battle back to health, told from the viewpoint of her loving, but baffled young daughter.Because it is told from the perspective of a young child, we are limited in what manic depression feels like, although there are a few succinct descriptions.Where it errs is after the mother is well, and her continuing wellness is presented as a ""choice."" Even with medication and therapy, people with mental illness can relapse, and to present it as such an easy and permanent victory does those who suffer from mental illness a disservice. Manic depression is simply not something one can ""decide"" to recover from and stay well."
4,"Excellent book, couldn't put it down!",The most significant strength in the book was the characters. Each character seemed so real and so full of emotion that I felt I was really seeing the story unfold from a first-person point of view. The way each chapter ends makes you want to read on and find out what events will surface next in the jumbled lives of the Barnes family. I strongly recommend this book to all readers!
3,The Daria Planner,I am a big fan of Daria. However this Software was not as great as I had hoped. The layout was pretty good. The only thing that was great about it was the video clips. The padded walls part was not as good and the back grounds can be downloaded from any daria fan site. Be prepared to be disappointed.
5,The only choice for squash,"Other brands just don't cut it, Dunlop double dot is the only ball I play with."
5,the best for me,"I have been using this gel for many years now. I am old enough that you would think I shouldn't get zits anymore, but every now and then they find their way back into my life, especially in the summer. This product works great for me. I start using it at the first sign that a pimple might be forming and they don't stand a chance. My skin is too dry and sensitive to use harsh products on my entire face, so I only use a small amount directly on the spot. I re-apply at least twice a day, more often if I am at home. If for some reason I do not have this product with me (such as forgot to pack it) they will form, so I know it is this product that is saving me. I am glad to see it on amazon as I just tried to order it from my usual place and they no longer have it.thanks again amazon - and beauty.com."
3,Not just any writer,"Jenny Boyd has written a very interesting book filled with anecdotes and the creative process of contemporary history's heavy weight rockers and blues musicians. More so being the sister of Patty Boyd -who was married to not only Eric Clapton but George Harrison,as well, although not simultaneously, Jenny socialized and hung out with many of the subjects in this book."
4,"Great Country Christian music, nice vocal arrangments!",Lovely music that fills the heart. It's great to listen to country music and hear positive endings to the lyrics. Lisa has done a great project and we sure enjoy her voice!
4,Transgresora,"Definitivamente una obra de arte transgresora, es difícil expresar todo lo que estas imágenes provoca en el espectador, imagenes que logran una estética sofisticada, mística y melancólica. Es una excelente adquisición, mi favorito del autor."
5,Welcome back Goren and Eames!!!,"While I am a huge Goren and Eames fan, I was a little disappointed that there was little to no reference to the last episode in which Goren was fired and Eames left the department. This episode acted like it was just another day at Major Case. There was a little reference in the opening scene welcoming them back but that was it. And who is this new captain? What's his background? I truly miss Captain Deakins as he was my favorite captain for this version of Law and Order.Having said that, this was such a relief after having to live through season 9 which was just awful. Truly I am surprised that this Law and Order was renewed. This episode goes back to the earlier days of Criminal Intent and showcases D'Onofrios talent at shaping the case as Bobby Goren. It's also great to have partners who actually work with each other which wasn't happening at all last season. I am very happy to have this duo back even if its just for 10 episodes."
5,"Love, Love, Love Law & Order Criminal Intent!!!","I am sooooo glad you brought back Law & Order Criminal Intent!!! I'd heard you were removing it, along with the Original Law & Order. I wish you hadn't removed the Original Law & Order:( It was my favorite also!! Whomever is writting for L&O; are wonderful writers!Thank you Very much"
5,Masterly,"Disappointingly out of print. The essay on Walt Whitman is alone worth the price of admission. In it RLS is led to discuss the art and craft of poetry with surprising lucidity and characteristic concision. Also essays on Thoreau, Realism, and ""Books which Have Influenced Me"" are notable, though not all the essays here are literary. Lacking a current edition, fans of literature and 19th century eloquence should go for a used or collector's copy of this wonderful compendium."
5,Classic Laura,This is a great VHS! Watching and hearing Laura sing and dance non-stop is great fun. So sad to have her out of our lives--thank heavens for CDs and tapes.
4,A Rough Start...,"OK, OK, we get it. You don't like or trust nobility. The heroine, Maddie, spends the first 1/3 of the book in a tedious round of snide insults with the hero, Quin, Marquis of Warefield. If you can make your way past the beginning, once a ""truce"" of sorts is called between them and she stops being so witchy all the time, I actually came to really like the story. The secondary characters were well done and I enjoyed what they brought to the story. By the end, I would have given this book 5 stars, but once I thought back on the beginning I knew I couldn't. As much as I liked the book, I don't think I'd read it again knowing I'd have to plow through those first annoying chapters."
2,Bratty heroine,"Others have mentioned the heroine is a brat, and she truly is. I'm half-way through and dislike her immensely. Shouldn't I like her by page 156, and be rooting for her and the gorgeous hero? I feel bad that Quin is going to end up with this awful woman. This isn't the worst book I've ever read, but there are so many better ones! The plot sounded fun to me and Quin isn't an alpha male, but still likeable enough. Its Maddie. She slaps him. She makes fun of him. She has atrocious manners. She's insufferable!"
1,Angry Heroine vents on Spineless Male,"Not one of the authors better novels. The heroine is angry and unlikeable. The hero mistakes her anger for flirting. Zero chemistry, trite plot. Skip this one."
2,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed in this book. I like the author and bought the book with very high expectations which were not met. I did find that the book is an older one with a spruced up cover, however, being that the book is a period piece, I didn't mind that much. However, I COULD NOT get past the heroine. Maddie was a hateful, spiteful, vindictive sort and I lost all respect for the hero because he seemed to love that about her."
5,Excellent service,"I recieved this book in perfect shape, better then discribed in sellers profile. Would order from them again"
4,"good, fun reading","Believe it or not, this book was recomended to me by my language arts teacher in high school and it was one of the first romance novels that I had ever read. The book was extremely enjoyable to read, full of great dialogue and fun characters. I especially loved Rafe, Quin's brother. All in all, it was a great story. I just wish the cover wasn't so scandalous though."
5,Historical soviet Ballet - a real treat,"Considering that these recordings are more than 50 years old, they are a real delight, one could well wish for much more of this, here we have really delightful ballet. Galina Ulanova, Maya Pliserskaya are a delight to watch, especially I found The Fountains of Bakhehisarai, with the 43 year old Ulanova and the 28 year old Plisetskaya a real delight, it also reminds one of just how the Soviet Union embraced many nationalities, as did also the earlier Russia, this ballet is one not to miss, also The flames of Paris, provide an interesting view into the French Revolution, again an excellent ballet piece, this DVD IS THOROUGHLY RECOMMENDABLE"
3,Expanding our concept of God,"The basic premise of this book is that most of us have an inadequate concept of what God is. The first half, subtitled ""Unreal Gods"" is devoted to dispelling a number of popular notions about God's nature. The general thrust is that our personal theologies put too many limits on the Almighty.The second half of the book ""An adequate God"" was, ironically, less convincing than the first. Too much ink was used to promote the ""Jesus was God"" theory, adding that Jesus' message 2000 years ago was all God ever needed to give us to prove Himself to us. Too little space was given to what God is for us here and now.The book challenges us to part with our limited perspectives, but is not entirely successful at inspiring unlimited vision."
4,A classic,"This book was written by a British preacher long ago but the material is still relevant, although the language is at times outdated. I read an updated version of this book and then went back to read this and liked the original better! He presents many arguments about people's ideas about God and what constitutes a more realistic image of the Almighty. Interesting reading."
4,The Second Half is Better,"I picked up an early edition of this book at a used book sale recently. I had heard of Phillips, but had not read any of his writings. Unlike an earlier reviewer, I enjoyed the second half of the book much more than the first. I am a C.S. Lewis fan, so I am already quite familiar with the ""destructive"" views of God which are briefly examined in the first half of this book. But, the second part of the book in which the ""constructive"" view/feel for God is explored is, in my estimation, good and original stuff. [I liked that Phillips used the word ""stuff"" so I thought I'd add it here.] Like Lewis, and unlike so many of the more modern Christian writers, Phillips can certainly ""turn a phrase"". He writes so well that it makes his constructive vision of God, in the person of Jesus, come alive and convince. Christians should share/mention the book when evangelizing; non-Christians should read it to see that God is big enough to handle their questio ns and criticisms."
4,"Don't label, box and bury God","This book will show you how we all want to define God as we want to, not as God wants. You will see yourself in the pages of this book and hopefully, you will make an honest effort to rise above your restrictive defintion of God. If so, it will have expanded your understanding of your world. This is a good book for a class in spirituality to discuss."
4,Challenges Us to a Bigger View of God,"This book helps us learn to accept God as He is rather than as we imagine Him to be. It helps those who have either an authoritarian view of God or a permissive view of Him. We must also face the fact that God does not operate in ways that we can predict. Hence, for example, the challenge of suffering and evil."
5,Find your misconceptions about God in this book...,"...then keep reading to move towards a better understanding of him.In church school classes, in Bible studies, even in pulpits, I constantly encounter people who have a neatly categorized, labeled and filed-away God. The most common thing I see is people who reject a particular doctrine, Scriptural passage, or the like, because they know ""God wouldn't do that"". And how do they know? Because THEY wouldn't do that if THEY were God. Yes, their God is too small; and probably so is yours and mine. Reading this book will help us realize how great he is."
4,Good Intro to Liberal Christianity,"The first half of this book is devoted to demolishing destructive views of God. Phillips can be as unsparing at this as Nietzsche or Feuerbach. Especially shocking is his section entitled ""Pale Galilean."" The second half of the book attempts to reformulate the Biblical view of Jesus and to make his sayings palatable and comprehensible to modern readers. Some readers may feel that Phillips ""tames"" Jesus's hard sayings to the point that they become unrecognizable. On the other hand, for those who are looking to escape from fundamentalism into a more liberal version of Christianity, this book just might be the key."
5,Fits Palm M515,"I love my old Palm M515, but the stylus always seems to go missing. This is my second 3 pack--so glad it's still available on Amazon."
1,Don't buy it!,"Zero. That's how many stars this gets. Why? There is a ream of evidence suggesting that this entire EP was taken from draft to final cut in one ... afternoon.... I previewed ""Baby's Got a Temper"" ... The wonderfully creative lyrics play out again and again: ""We love rohypnol. She's got rohypnol. We take rohypnol. She's got rohypnol. This baby's got a temper. You'll never get her.""Prodigy has produced quite a bit of good material, most of which has little or no actual message. ..."
2,For whom the bell tolls--for fans of thier back catalogue,"This single, and most likely (though it saddens me to say it) the album from which it originates [Always Outmanned...], is dissapointing. This statement is only for those who love Experience and feel that the Prodigy peaked with Music For the Gilted Generation--folks who were introduced to the Prodigy via Fat of the Land will probably love it. It's got plenty of ...slurred ""singing"" by Keith Flint and mediocre beats that compliment it very well. I've been waiting many years for signs of a return to the powerful, compelling, and complex beats of old, and it looks like I might have to just give up. My catalogue of 15+ Prodigy lps and eps might not be getting any new friends any time soon."
2,Definitely not Prodigy's best material,"Maybe it's because I've been listening to the energetic and inspired electronic music of german industrial/EBM for the past few years. Or perhaps it's just Prodigy did not put enough effort into this release. Whatever the reason, I can't recommend this single...Baby's Got A Temper just does not catch the attention of my ears. In ways it does mimic the style of a few of Prodigy's past songs with the break beats and repeating synth lines, but it just can't match the magic of their former hits like Breathe and Firestarter. The remixes of Baby's Got A Temper are not really that much to look forward to on this single either. Even die-hard Prodigy fans should find somewhere to listen to this single first before buying it. Hopefully Prodigy's upcoming album will incorporate some more inspired songs for redemption from this lackluster single."
3,Ok...heres the deal,"So with their latest LP on the way they decided to release this single to wet our appetite (although this song is not on 'Always outnumbered Never outgunned)...the only problem was that 'BABY'S GOT A TEMPER"" is not that great of a song. I will admitt that I enjoyed the Dub Mix, sort-of, andt he instumental has some replay value, but the lyrics were tireing and far from spot on, and the A Capella was a waste of a track...and the thing is that 'Outnumbered, Outgunned' is such a freaking awsome albulm that they could have churned out something better on the outset, you know, the stir up more excitment for their upcoming release. Oh well, whats done is done and their latest album has been out for a few months now. BUY THAT CD...much better than this mediocre attempt."
2,Good News: They're Back. Bad News: It's a Lackluster Single,"The below reviews make me wonder if they heard the same song I did. Five years since their international smash ""The Fat of the Land,"" electronic punkers Prodigy return with ""Baby's Got a Temper,"" a curiously muted comeback of a single. Though not awful, the beats and groove sound very 1997; a mid-tempo dance rocker with no surprises. I can't pinpoint what else is wrong with this single, but it looks like it could use a serious remix or maybe more production. The good news is that the band announced that their next album won't be around until early 2003, giving Prodigy ample time to beef up their sound and come up with better material than this."
2,The album better be better,"This song was ok, but if that is what the whole album will sound like I will be pissed. They take a five year break and come up with this for a first single? Considering the time they have had, this song is a disgrace. I am thankful for the instrumental version cuz Keiths singing in it ruins the whole thing."
4,Need to give Prodigy a break....,"Everyone seems to hate this single but I really like it and I have gotten my roommate into liking prodigy just because of this single. I would agree that it is a bit lacking but I wouldn't guess that they've been trying to make a cd for 6 years, guys. They have to have gone vacation or just a break in general after the Dirtchamber sessions came out. So I would say that's a bit unfair to make that claim. Anyways I'm a diehard prodigy fan and own almost every single song they've put out (except the What Evil Lurks E.P) and I would suggest anyone who is like me to pick up this single."
3,"Not bad, but still the Worst Prodigy Single","BGAT is a nice bangin' track and it's got a great video. But that is pretty much everything nice to be said about this single. The track sounds exactly as if taken off The Fat of the Land (which is not what Liam intended); the dub remix is plain simple and repetative (in comparison to Any other Prodigy track). The instrumental version is completely useless as the lyrics are so few. The acapella version is not simply not worth listening to, it is trully rediculous (having an acapella version of track that has 3 lines of lyrics, predominately non-sense, is hilarious). The video is not included, which makes the single even less desireable. Liam Howlett himself said in an interview that he hates this track, that they released it under pressure from XL Recordings and that it won't be on the forthcoming album. It think that sums it put the best. Recommended only to Prodigy fanatics."
5,Adult Children of Alcoholics,This is a great refresher for individuals who suffer the effects of living in an alcoholic home.
2,Mostly filler,"System of a Down's debut album seemed hopeful. An unique sociopolitical hardcore album with a bit of room for improvement. Unfortunatly the improvement never came. The follow up album, Toxicity, contains a few singles and simple filler tracks. The political lyrics suggested by the band title have been toned down (probably to broaden the audience) as well as the rock. Very disappointing."
4,System on an Up,"This album is just amazing. System of a Down are definately a band we are going to hear a lot about in the not so distant future. Toxicity is quite different to their self titled debut, the music and vocals are much better, this is definately a band whom has musically matured.This is a very strong album, Serj Tankians lyrics are good but it is his vocal style which captures my attention. These songs are suprisingly catchy and Serj's range shines out, the guitar and drum work are commendable as well.This album is definately worth picking up. The strongest tracks are ""Prison Song"", ""Forest"" and ""Chop Suey"". The only weak track is ""Jet Pilot"" which really is why i did not give this album 5 stars.System of a Down are definately on an up."
2,Interesting!!,"Well I do like the music for the most part, it's well thought out in places. However what drives me nuts about this cd is that I don't think the band as a whole can think of more than 5 words per song. I mean come on, I mean come on, I mean come on I mean come on. See, that drove you nuts and so will this cd after a few listens. They constantly say the same thing over and over again. A note to System boys, PLEASE WRITE MORE LYRICS WITH YOUR SONGS!!!!!!!!. The music rocks and the production is very good, just write some more meaningful lyrics please!!2 Stars may be a bit tough I'll admit, but these guys have something here and they should really try and explore it a bit more on the lyrics side of things as it would truly be awesome then. I'm sure they could tweak it a bit without losing the humor that really is System's secret weapon."
4,Drowning the sorrow in sweet song,All the world Ive seen before me passing by. wow. May i take a moment to say thanks for these words you sing. Today was my first time to have the pleasure of hearing song #9. I havent stopped since. Is it bad to listen to the same song over and over. i dont care. i could just get lost in my rage and pain thinking of all we lose each and every day. we may all be helpless in what happens in this world so accept it and let go of everything holding you back. peace
3,"Way too much positive feedback, very average release","OK, so I've listened to this over and over and over again, thanks to my best friend who insists its the greastest thing he's heard since the initial Pantera. Come on. The riffs are so clearly stolen from early 90s, and the vocals, so obviously would not exist without Primus to Defy The Laws of Tradion. So disappointed. Someday, someone gets a clue, apparently not in my lifetime. I miss Bradley so much."
3,lacking.....,"I am (or at least was) a huge system of a down fan, but Toxicity is a defenite creative setback. The songs on this album are way too safe. Just look at the singles that have been released, chop suey!, toxicity and now aerials...all these track are the softest commercially sounding tracks on the album. The album shows little inovation and adding daron (the guitar player) as a backup vocalist on more songs was a bad idea concidering the guy cannot sing at all on this album. Gone are the mysterious sounding, innovative system of a down and they have been replaced a poor sounding parody of themselves.Pick this album up if you let Music channels and radio dictate what music you listen to. Sad...."
2,Could be better,"I love soad and I was really looking forward to the followup. I heard chop suey on the radio and I got it the same week it came out. While the songs are very well written, it lacks the flow and the energy from the first album. Perhaps I had listened to the debut a bit too much, but I felt they took a little too much time with this one."
5,This is banging,"This is how i usualy shop for cds i hear or see the video then if i like i buy the cd When i saw the video for the song chop suey i was impressed. S O A D has a metal / harmoney / guitar thing goin on and i was really feelin it. we all know how some artist have that one good song and the rest is trash. thsi is not the case here. The rest of the cd shockingly good but chop suey is still the best. The bottom line is this: if you liked chop suey then what are you waiting for buy it now. trust me, you wont be disappointed."
5,Album of the Year,"System of a Down's s/t debut was an album that totally blew me away. It is among my top 10 fav. albums of all time. That was the year 1998, and it has been 3 years since SOAD has blessed us with their musical goodness, and now 3 years later SOAD has dropped Toxicity. Toxicity has picked up right where s/t left off. The same unexpected time changes and death-metal-like intensity is what SOAD is all about. Serj is sounding better than ever with his distinct hardcore growls, and Daron Malakian returns as one of the industry's most talented guitarists. Toxicity is the album of the year....plain and simple...nothing will top this album.Tracks of note--- Prison Song, Needles, Deer Dance, Chop Suey! ATWA, Science, Toxicity, Psycho and Ariels"
3,System Of A Down REVIEW,It is actually a pretty good CD but if i were you i would get Fugazi's The Argument or NoFx's The Decline or watch Fight Club
5,WICKED CD!!!,"One of the best cd's ever!!!!!serj's voice sometimes annoys me so much (when he screams), but not to worry cuz its still a wicked cd!science is a boring trackif i were yall id take a listen to forest, ATWA, aerials,chop suey, prison song,deer dance, you wont know what its like if u dont listen to the whole cd!if u were a true soad fan u would LOVE this cd, and if u werent then listen to the cd, give it a try, who knows wat could happen after!!!!!ATWA ROCKS!!!!!!!"
5,Toxicity- Intelligent Punk Metal,"Toxicity is easily one of the best releases of the year, in any genre. System of a down has taken heavy metal and interlaced it with melody and arabic influences to create an entirely new and different sound. It is heavy metal, so the faint hearted may find it a little hard to get past the sheer heaviness of the album. Daron and Serj's lyrics are at times very direct (""Prison Song,"" ""Deer Dance,"" and definetly ""Bounce"") and at other times quite mysterious (""Toxicity,"" ""Chop Suey""). Overall, a great album. They showed heaps of promise and their excellent but occasionally poor debut, and delivered on every sliver of it. Very highly recomended. High points on the album include ""Chop Suey!"", ""Prison Song,"" ""Aerials"", and ""Shimmy."""
5,unbelievable,"system of a down can be described as a political band - much like rage against the machine. but this album, written by a band whos known to be a little crazy, writes about everything from the U.S. prison system to pogo sticks. great melodies, especially ""Chop Suey!"", theyre first single from this cd. u like ANY rock? you'll like this"
5,COOL,"Awsome cd...almost evry song is worth listening to...prison song,pogo,and chop suey are all realy good."
5,Killer Album!!,"This is a great album by SOAD. I've had this cd for awhile now and its great to listen to when your mad. They blend a lot of great stuff in this album. Serj's voice is amazing. He can have a raging voice full of angst one minute, and the next have a soft,beautiful voice. This is more polished than their 1st album and the lyrics have matured and gotten better. Musicly though I'm still convinced that their self-titled album was better. It was a lot heavier and explosive. Not to say that this album isn't. They bring out all the stuff on here. They mix raging metal with Serj's powerful voice, to soft, lyricly amazing songs. You can't go wrong on this cd. The best songs are Deer Dance, Chop Suey, Science, Toxicity,Prison Song, and Forest. If you liked their 1st album you'll like this one. Now get out there and buy this CD!!!"
5,i don't mind the political statement,as a conservative I really liekd this cd the songs where really cool and yes they did express a liberal view of America but you can't just look at one side of an issue and System of A Down brought up some good points I loved Areals and the Prison Song
5,awsome CD!!!,I love this cd. Deerdance and chop suey has to be my favorie songs on here. I dont see how anybody dosent like this band...I have all of their CDs including Steal This Album and i love them all but some people say that Steal this album [is bad]...it dosent. If you like any kind of music you should like this so get it!!! I gave this album 5 stars because it is just a great band.
4,"Really Great sounding album, but","The album is good, good editing, good instrments, good everything, but I don't like politcal lyrics. I just don't like them. Conservative or Liberal, i just don't think music is the proper place to air out politcal views."
5,A Great Sophomore Album!,"Although I did not hear their first album, I still can tell a good album when I hear one. I first heard Chop Suey from a friend, as he was humming it. I liked it, and then heard toxicity on the radio. Then, I knew I needed this. Toxicity has a really great guitar part, accompanied with great sounding drums. And, to show their musical ability, Toxicity is written in 12/8 Time Signature."
3,I should have borrowed a copy from a friend.,"I love the song Chop Suey! So, I was on the fence about buying the CD. Frankly, Chop Suey! is a kick-butt song. The rest of the CD is filled with very heavy riffs and deep, dark lyrics. Unfortunately, none really seem to catch the same harmonic style of Chop Suey!If you love hardcore - this is your album of the year. Others might want to listen before buying."
4,Not quite what i expected,"I expected to receive the album booklet/art with it, but received it in a generic case without the slightest bit of art. This was not mentioned online though the receipt with the item listed it to not have the art. Just a little disappointed that I'll need to hunt down the booklet and back art is all. however the album itself was in great condition, and read just fine."
3,Visionary battling ordinary,"Far from, though sometimes so close to what meaningless hardcore antics stand for, this assured sophomore brought enough cultural and melodic elements into potent but one dimensional aggression to warrant standout success, but in between noteworthy tracks put together in admirable ways lies repetitious brutality mixed with theatrical world influence."
5,The best album i have ever heard,"Wow, I am speechless after hearing this album. This cd has very good lyrics and ausome riffs. it is the best."
5,Even more amazing,"This album is even more amazing than the last album. If you liked ""System of a Down"" at all, pick up ""Toxicity"". All the songs here are awesome. They are both heavier and more beautiful than the songs on the last album. And all those anoying voice cracks of Serj are gone in this album. It rocks!"
1,Worse than I thought it could ever get,One of the worst collection of sounds ever slopped onto a disc. Utterly terrible.
1,Non-Existent,The order was never shipped out. I contacted the seller a week after the cd was supposed to ship and have yet to receive a response.
1,Miserable,"A faint excuse for hard rock, in any case, would surpass System of a Down's awful music, and their CD ""Toxicity"" is no exception. The song that is the CD's namesake has no identifiable beat. Chop Suey is half-assed. Half of the remaining songs are worth little. There is not a track on Toxicity that is worth anyone's time. System of a Down, a bad band in any case, has not had much luck in displaying their apparently quasi-mystical musical talent, and it remains to be seen how anyone can enjoy System of a Down's music-that which lacks tone, feeling, or any sense of emotion."
5,Best Rock Album of the Year,"These guys have influences out the wazoo, but they've managed to make their sound distinctly unique to their abilities and their message. With hints of Zappa, King Crimson, Tool and a gypsy caravan tambourine show, we're treated to incredibly tight song after tight song, and with the music ever-present despite the album's heavy politics. They don't treat the record as a chance to preach. They rock you out, and you wake up the next day thinking, ""Gee, why do I think funny now?""Classic album, seriously. And I'm not a rock head."
5,The most excellent thing to come out of the metal genre,"This is an album of a touching and beautiful sort, while still managing to be a hardcore kick-... metal fest. These two qualities will often combine in there style with songs that protest, such as Science, and song that have a message like Chop Suey. I recommend this album to anyone and everyone because I am not a metal head and have this one in my stereo constantly."
4,Pretty cool,"Most song on this cd i like. my favorite song is toxicity. i used to like chop suey but man, i've heard it over a million times. well, you won't be wasting your money. SOAD's first CD is pretty much the same. I bought this one first and you should too. It's rockin'. I would like these word to go out to everyone who reads my review ""do you cy when angels deserve to die?"" and ""do angels ever deserve to die"" well, bye. Don't forget to buy SOAD's Toxicity and there self-titled album it's not a waste of money."
3,System of a Down's Toxicity is almost Toxic,after my review of this cd i have to say i will never buy another cd from System of a Down again you are better off going with Tool or A Perfect Circle there may be only three tracks on this cd that sounds good buyer beware.....
5,Contender for Metal Album of the Year,"The guys from SOAD out did themselves with this sophmore album. From the opening track Prison Song you are drawn into the ferocious mayhem and at the same time subtle beauty that only SOAD could create. This album blew me away, there is not a bad song on here and Serj's vocal range goes from soft melody to out right demonic growls. Serj shouts and screams his lyrics over soem truly awesome guitar work by Daron. This album is harder, heavier, more left-of-center politically then their first album. Rage Against the Machine dropped the ball musically speaking and SOAD has picked it up and they have ran with it. I urge all metal fans and RATM fans to go pick this masterpiece up because I know you'll be as blown away as I was."
1,Pathetic,"The first time I listened to this album I was thoroughly disgusted. Repeated listens did nothing to endear me to it.This album basically sounds like it was written by a band that listened to ""System of a Down"" and thrashed out a really bad rip-off of it. Get the band's self-titled album and avoid this piece of garbage."
1,Rubbish,"This band suck and all 2 of their albums suck. Anyone who can tolerate this garbage for longer than 5 minutes deserves a free copy of evanesence.(a band right on par with this joke of a group). People who listen to this are going to be emabarassed two years from now when people finally realize that it is all pretty unlistenable.. I just can't believe there are people out there listening to this and actually saying ""Yeah, man.. This Rocks. This is great music!"" Thanks. THere is no flow to the music and the singer sounds like Beavis freaking out. For true genius and great songwriting, look no further than The Brian Jonestown Massacre."
1,Uh Oh,"I bought this when it came out because of all the hype, I really hadn't heard them on the radio as yet. After one listen I was disappointed..........and two listens I was pissed........after 3 listens I wanted my money back. The lead singer has got one of the worst, off key voices I've ever heard. The instrumentation is far superior over the vocals. I don't get why this band is so popular but to each his own."
1,System is DOWN...,"Have heard this band alternately referred to as, System Of A Downs Syndrome. no comment. save your money.To make up for the mistake, in case you already bought it,, try The Disco Biscuits. A pleasant surprise!~!~"
2,"Actually, I was disappointed...","Don't buy into the ""coolest album"" reviews, if you are into something heavy. I was referred to this group thanks to their advertised proximity to Slipknot's death-metal grind-core. I also heard ""Chop Suey"" on the TV.You can imagine my disappointment, when niether of the songs on the album, was as impressive as ""Chop Suey"", nor System of a Down's overall style corresponded with my expectations for it to be some death-metal hardcore.Basically, the songs are not that bad, but ONLY if you're into rock, or some oriental, armenian-arabic mix with horrible and meaningless lyrics and a blend of music styles. However, if you're looking for something heavy and killer, I'd say it's best to go for either Slipknot's ""IOWA"" or Slayer's ""God Hates Us All"", and leave this album to kindergarden rocker-kiddies."
2,[bad deal],Listin to The velvet underground's Murder Mystery and then listen to chop suey. You can not tell me they didn't rip that intro from the velvets.I Dont care about this CD I just felt like saying that they ripped the velvet underground's murder mystery off.
5,the messiah,"this album is the messiah. a gift to all true rock fans. system of a down are a 21st century metallica with a surpassing lyrical content to that of rage. the foursome hailing from armenia, based in the wonders of L.A have created a sound so original and astounding it is breath taking! their sound varies from nose-bleeding high tempo thrash metal to relaxing harmonic seronades between serj tankian and daron malakian. all conglomerating to create the 'perfect' rock album. songs to look out for are the two singles; chop suey! and toxicity and personal favourite psycho. this album will give you the highest adrenalin rush possible from a cd. to not purchase this cd would be a sacrilage to oneself and ones generation."
4,A lot slower but more into the vocals,"When system of a down's self title came out in 1998, I was most impressed with Serj's scream and the original songs that came out. The songs were fast and Serj's scream hit every song like bullets. I picked up this cd after hearing it off a friend.This album ""Toxicity"" is much more instrumental. Serj uses his voice more and Darren sings as well in Chop Suey and Needles. This album is much more wacky and different sounding than the first album. Songs like ""Bounce"" and ""Phsycho"" jumpy songs that don't capture as well as the other songs but ""deer dance"" and ""jet pilot"" not to mention ""X"" are catchy songs.This cd is great if you would want to hear Serj's voice and how he dramatically uses it in his poetic lyrics."
3,"Better than some, not most.","I hated metal, and I still do. It hurts my brain, the obnoxious screaming, annoying beats, and guitars so loud, it rocks the house if loud enough. But this defies metal, and makes other metal look like ... . The classic, Chop Suey!, is just great, simply put. I am a rap and rock fan, and always will be, but this song is excellent! The rest of the album is good, but to me, it sounds like these guys are testing out their equipment on a Saturday morning with nothing else to do. Every other song is pure metal. The hippie-style drug references, the religious aspects, and the dead cow sound is all classic metal. You may like this album, you may not. It all depends on your point of view."
5,Superb,"When I first heard the singles Aerials and Toxicity I knew I had to check this album out. I read some of the reviews on amazon and were more or less accurate to how I feel about this album. The vibrant 'Prison song' starts the show and sets you up for some serious rocking and it just flows from one song to another so easily. Technically they are brilliant Serj Tankian's voice is so unique and hauntingly changes from madness to mellow in seconds. There are, in my opinion 10 great songs on this album but one to look out for (after the favourites Chop suey,deer dance,Toxicity and Aerials) is 'Forest' the drumming and guitars are mind blowing. Buy this album!"
2,sophisticated metal,". . . musically at least. Sometimes I just can't get behind a group or album that has merit because something stupid or irritating sticks out like a sore thumb. Thus I will never give Travis, Mr. Big, Mr. Mister or Uncle Kracker a chance because I don't want such stupid band names in my collection. I almost rejected Korn outright because of their lame name. Gee, might as well call your band ""Carrots"" or ""Broccholi.""SOAD can rock, no question. Some of their earlier stuff is good, well mostly the insane-sounding ""Sugar"" is great. But this album has such gratingly, embarrassingly bad lyrics I have to turn it off.""Life is a waterfall/ We drink from the river/ Then turn around and build up the wall?"" . . . ""Always wanna win but you never wanna lose?"" - DUH!!!!Sorry, this music is for pinheads."
5,Good CD,This is my second favorite SOAD album. It kicks ass! Here's a song rating:1. Prison Song 5/52. Needles 5/53. Deer Dance 5/54. Jet Pilot 5/55. X 4/56. Chop Suey! 10/57. Bounce 5/58. Forest 5/59. Atwa 4/510. Science 5/511. Shimmy 5/512. Toxicity 5/513. Psycho 5/514. Aerials 9/5Bottom line:: It's a good album
2,Stupid Album,"Like all nu metal, this album is weak and stupid. The lyrics are dumb, and the stupid singer is yellin' like some sort of a maniac. There are a couple of okay songs that save this from being a one star album, but a word of warning to metal newbies: this is not real metal. Go get some good old school metal instead, like Iron Maiden or Ozzy Osbourne."
3,Read this (very important),"This album is pretty good because of 3 songs: Toxicity (of course), Bounce and Chop Suey. These three songs stand out in all the album making me even not to renember all the other songs names. That's why only 3 stars: 1 for Toxicity, 1 for Bounce and 3-rd for Chop suey. Sorry but thats a fact nothing more to hear in this album, really."
2,Interesting? Yes. Good? Well......,"I wanted to like it. Really, I did.It's like somebody took Crowbar, Tool, Cake, Rage Against the Machine and Primus, wadded it all up into one big ball and threw the thing against the wall.This CD has it's moments, but it's as if they're just trying a little too hard to be cool, to be ""left of center"", to be lyrically and musically clever.I don't often regret buying a CD, but I really do regret this purchase. There's better stuff out there in this genre. If you're on the fence, don't spend your dough on this dog. If you act fast, my copy will be on Ebay. Bidding starts at one cent."
5,best DAMN cd ever made,this is the heaviest cd ever I listened to it and the first words out of my mouth were this is the ...best cd ever best song is shimmy next chop suey next forest and last needles if you have every other cd you should buy this one or you'll regret it
5,a new genre,"after reveiwing this cd, i discovered that system of a down not only revolutionzed modern rock....they also created a new genre. first, all the songs on the cd sound unique. each member of the band is highlighted in each and every second of each track. john dolmayan pounds on his drums and cymbals, making each fill in and beat match perfectly with the music. shavo's smooth bass creates a strong deep tone and Daron's immaculate guitar skills shine on guitar creative melodies and solo's. last but not least, serj tankian's great voice and deep lyrics contribute the finishing touches to perfect the band. i recommend to EVERYONE to buy this cd and give it a chance. you may think it is awkward at first. but soon you will learn to grow upon it and love it. system of a down's cd ""toxicity"" is truly a remarkable experience."
3,I'm kind of disappointed,"System of a down. First CD was unbelieveable. This one...well, different story. It starts off good with prison song, moving into needles i am beginning to wonder what the hell happened to Systum. From there the songs on the CD don't sound ANYTHING like the first one. Bands that are alledgedly ""against our government,"" but like capitalism, do this. Keep the ideas the same, but weaken the music. Lyrics to this CD are great (most of the songs) I just wish the music sound was more like the first CD...gives me the impression that System in a way sold themselves out. Hopefully the next CD will capture their older, much heavier sound. I also like serji's voice a lot more on the first CD. :( please come back to us System of a Down, not the band that put their name in a HOLLYWOOD BANNER to cover their CD."
3,actually 3 1/2 stars... I'll tell you why,"the reason for 3.5 stars is because if you really think about it the cd all sounds the same. Don't get me wrong there are some really good songs on here but doesn't save it. In my opinion Toxicity is the worst of the 3 albums (well steal this ablum isn't a real cd either) here's how I rank the cd's1.Self-titled cd-the best cant get past the craziness and really sweet songs!2.Steal This Ablum!-has on of my fav. System line ever, good songs.3.Toxicity-good, but lacks different sounds to it, sounds like one huge song.overall, I might reccommend this cd for first-timer or just if you want the whole collection.by the way im just too lazy too use the over 13 review form!!"
2,"I may have enjoyed this album, had i been deaf!","I may have enjoyed this album, had i been 14 years old or deaf. Strangely enough i listen to new and old metal but there is somethin about this band i dont like, #1 his voice is very annoying from the get go, where are they going with this garbage.Its been awhile since weve seen some fresh new metal/music that is decent and i have a feeling something is coming cause if it isnt,i dont think this genre will be pop much longer."
5,Real good music.,"This CD is really , really awesome. It's not that i only like this heavy metal/rock genre. Quite frankly, i like every type of music, besides country, that is.(heh) This is a review coming a person who likes everything from Dido to Disturbed. rap, rock, whatever, i like it all. This is just a really good CD for anyone who likes any music at all and also has very good taste. Very great work from SOAD that should be enjoyed by everyone"
3,"Amazing at times, only decent overall...","There are a few tracks on this album that are just amazing...Chop Suey, Toxicity, and one of my favorite songs ever - Aerials...but as a whole I cannot rate it so highly. Some of the other tracks are good, but many are only average or annoying. They are at their best when they do songs that actually have melodies and when Serj actually sings, as in the three songs I named earlier. Unfortunately, most of the songs don't have much of a melody, and Serj relies on yelling and screaming rather that using his excellent voice for what it does best...sing. I still think the good outweighs the bad and that it is worth buying...but I don't think it deserves much of the praise it has gotton, such as Spin Magazine's album of the year. THAT, I do not understand."
4,Dont listen to this for whats right...,"Listen to it for what's wrong. This may sound absurd, but what's right with ""Toxicity"" is what's wrong. The extremely odd signature changes, the weird voice that Sarje puts forward, and the reverse genious-genious guitar that's played make this record incredible. This is just hard-core head-banging music at it's best. Pick this one up or some heart stopping music."
3,Not What You Think,"Like the song ""Aerials"" that you may have heard on the radio? Well, listen to a little more of this CD online before you buy it. I was in love with the song ""Aerials"", and do enjoy the CD, but it was not what I expected it to be. More modern and quick-tempered with a stinging flare that will leave you breathless at the end, this CD is for those that like a fire. It is the chili pepper of music and the song ""Aerials"" is the white lamb. So do not be decieved by the song ""Aerials"", buy this CD for the other 13 tracks on it."
4,"Original, yet classic",System of a Down is a great band because unlike everyone else their sound is so original. You can't compare them to any other band. Their lyrics are meaningful and are often humorous. This band is fast and loud and will make you crank it up and slam your head.
5,"MORE, DAMN IT, MORE!!","I have't read all of the reviews out there for this album but i am sure that there cannot be much left unsaid... Speaking as someone who is fed up with the over produced offerings of so called ""Nu-metal"" i can say that this is truly a step above filled with Insane chord progressions and arpeggios and wait you can actually make out the Bass guitar part...wow...and vocals that send shivers down my spine and raise the hairs on the back of my neck. I wait with bated breath for a follow up!!"
5,One Of My Most Listened To Albums,"Toxicity is one of the standout albums that i have in my music collection. When I first heard of System Of A Down, i brushed them off as a group that were cahing in on the craze that was sweeping the world, unitl my friend lent me their album. The standout tracks are Toxicity (my favourite track on the album and one of the best songs that I have ever heard), Aerials, Pogo, Needles (for comedy reasons), Chop Suey and Psycho. Toxicity is an album taht you will want to listen to over and over again without getting bored."
4,New nu metal listener,"I have recently gotten into SOAD and hard rock in general...years after adolescence. I feel like these guys are a healthy outlet for my rage against the neo-con right wing direction our poor country seems to be going. This album's first three songs really pump me up. For the most part SOAD is not boring repetitive [...] like much of hard rock and generally the lyrics are meaningful with some exceptions. Serg's powerful voice gives chills at times. A great album to crank up your kickbox routine, annoy Jesus-freaks, and non-violently expend some warranted pent-up anger."
5,"Great Songs, Great Messages","this Cd is great and has some truthful messages. i like ""Deer Dance"" its about brutal police and is a great metal song.another one is ""Prison Song"" its about how america has too many priaons and is true, treatment should be increased, and law enforcement decreased. this is a great CD from a great band, buy it today!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Well....I enjoy it.,"I bought this album after seeing the ""Toxcicity"" video on MTV2. I had known a few of System of a Down's songs, but after I heard this song, I really liked it. I must admit, I'm a little dissapointed in the album overall, but nonetheless, I enjoy listening to it. I love the songs Chop Suey, Atwa, and Toxicity. Those songs made the album well worth buying. The other songs, however, all sound alike, but are okay to listen to. Despite this, I do not regret buying this album. Be your own judge."
4,Its almost Rage-like!!!,"There are a few CD's out there that are able to be played when you want loud, loud, I mean frikkin loud music. You know the kind to take out some agression, or just to get pumped. Rage Against the Machine was the original LOUD CD, but I think Toxicity might be its equivalent. This CD is excellent."
1,System Of A Down SUCKS!!!!,I honestly think this album shouldnt even be on sale cause it's just that bad! X[
1,No disrespect to SOAD fans but I cannot get into these guys,"System of a Down's Toxicity has to be one of the worst albums I ever heard in the last five years.I bought it on a whim back in April of 2002 as everyone was telling me this album was amazing to see what the fuss what about of these guys.The songs like Chop Suey, the title cut, Ariels, Prison Song and the rest are all the same nu-metal poor me, I hate my life garbage which was immortalized by lame groups like Linkin Park, Korn and especially Limp Bizkit.The stupid singer and the guitarist are whining and screaming like 2-year olds that didn't get what they wanted.If you like metal, I recommend you get some good old school metal instead, like Iron Maiden, Black Sabbath, AC/DC, Motorhead, Judas Priest and the one and only Van Halen."
1,What is this?,Sorry Guys for a old Classic Rocker like me I coundn't take this.!. That Singer is mostly likely the worst I have ever heard. I would rather puncture my eardrums then ever listen to this again!.
5,those wacky guys,"i just have to say that this album is just great, it follows well in the footsteps of the other.these guys know how to rock, pure and simple.do your self a favor and pick up this loud mess of great rock."
2,Despicable lyrics,Despicable lyrics promoting drugs and denigrating police destroy otherwise noteworthy and engaging rock music.
2,More bad songs than good,"Yes, System of a Down have made some great songs here on Toxicity, but they have also put out some garbage ones that make you wonder why they even consider these half way decent. The good songs are ones that you still here on the radio quite a bit so by now most people are probably tired of those songs anyway. Overall, the bad stuff heavily outways the good so unless you can get it for cheap I would stay clear."
2,Bunch of Garbage,There is only 2 good songs on this cd and you here them on the radio all the time. This is depressing dreadful music I wanted to slash my wrist after listening to it but instead I broke it and toss it in the trash can were it belongs.
2,Weak,"System of a Down's unusual interpretation of modern metal has one them credit amongst metalheads searching for something different. I, myself, would love to find something out there that's totally different (I.e, another Tool vs Korn), but this just isn't it. System of a Down's weak sophomore release just doesn't do it. It lacks any sign of maturity music-wise. Lyrical content has grown a little, as eveident on Forest and Deer Dance. But this lacks anything that would musically satisfy someone with an ear for real metal..."
5,Toxicity Towers Over the Music World,"Rarely does a band like System come to the forefront of the underground metal world. They have struck gold (maybe even platinum) with their sophomore album, Toxicity. The amazing creativity behind the minds of Serj Tankian and Daron Malakian are nothing short of godly. The spellbinding blend of political messages and energy-driven music gives the listener an amazing new view of the world. Really! ""Prison Song"" demonstrates as such. ""Science"", my favorite song on the album, also gives personal views and provides insight into the mind of Tankian. Though i cannot even compare it to their first album, Toxicity reigns near the top of the best metal albums ever! No lie."
5,great cd,"i love this cd! i especially love Chop Suey. Recommendations for this song- Play on the bus to any field show or field tip, the results are usually reaaaallly funny. bnu 4evr."
4,"A great album, not best though.","I feel system is on it's way to developing its new sound, like Shavo said they were trying to do. The self titled was had a harder sound, Toxicity got a more melodic feel to it, and although songs from STA didnt make the Toxicity cut, they sound even more unique. Toxicity is great for those who are in between. If you don't want hardrocking songs like P.L.U.C.K or Soil, and want more focused melodic songs like Chop Suey or Atwa then Toxcity is it. (It still has hard rocking tunes don't worry) Overall a great album. Better to come though."
2,What am i missing?,"With the exception of Chop Suey and Forest, this album is nothing but screaming over intense power chords....and to me that is not music. How can everyone say that this is such a masterpiece? You want a masterpiece that rocks? Check out Metallica's ""Master of Puppets"" or ""Black Album"" or Cigar's ""Speed is Relative"" or any of the earlier stuff by Led Zeppelin. This album has a few nice moments, but those moments are more than offset by moments of crap. Yes, sometimes Serj Tankian hits a pretty note or sometimes they play a cool guitar riff or drum fill, but there is too much incoherent screaming and angry, cliched death metal nonsense. Too many bands think that in order to rock they have to scream and play their guitars as loudly as possible. Jimmy Page didnt play super loud and intense power chords, and he was one of the best guitarists of all time! You dont have to be loud simply for the sake of being loud to rock, and these guys do not rock."
2,The new system blows,"...I only like the first five songs on that toxicity cd and the rest sucks in my opinnion. If youre thinking about buying that ""steal this album"" cd, its kinda dumb to buy a cd that looks like it was downloaded style cd. Its worth it to buy it if you dont have a cd burner or a computer. You should try System's Debut cd before you try Toxicity."
3,"Not the best, but not the worst","For a mainstream band, System of a Down really isn't that bad. Although their debut has more interesting songs, and is a lot better, Toxicity still has some good stuff to offer. ""Chop Suey!"" and ""Aerials"" are probably the two best songs on the radio right now, and I like the transtions between folk and metal in them. ""Prison Song"" and ""Bounce"" are both insane, like songs on the first CD, and ""ATWA"" never fails to depress me. While all the songs I've mentioned are good, I can't exactly say the same about the rest of the album. Some songs (""Needles,"" ""Forest,"" etc.) are extremely boring and annoy me to death. Oh well, it's mainstream music. I wouldn't exactly expect the sort of brilliance demonstrated by In Flames and Neurosis to be found in the mainstream. So if you want to buy this CD, go ahead. It's better than Linkin Park. Just know that there are underground bands out there that are a million times better than these guys..."
2,a few good songs,"a few good songs, buy this one if you are going to buy this cd at all, because it comes with some cool features."
2,NO: THIS IS CRAP!,"DON'T LISTEN TO WHAT ANYBODY SAYS! This album is such a letdown after the first. Even their b-sides are better than this! Ugh! This is the perfect example of a band that reahces their haitus, and figures no matter what they do people will buy into it any way, so they make a horrible album. This album is like Nonpoints Development letdown after their groundbreaking Statement. Bad stuff. Keep away from this cliche trendy little cop-out band."
2,They get an extra star for effort.,"I guess it isn't really fair of me to slag this group off completely, as I have never listened to one of their albums in its entirety (I can barely bring myself to sit through half a song, let alone half an hour). So they get two stars instead of one.I just don't like anything about this band. The music itself is monotonous, and the frontman's voice irritates me. As for the hard-hitting political lyrics, I could probably write better:""The government is bad.""""They lie.""""Arrrgh.""Pass this up if you have any respect for your eardrums."
3,Expecting more,"I was anxiously awaitng this release due to the single Chop Suey! which was full of energy and original. If the execs were trying to hook people by releasing this single first, it worked on me.I am certainly not one to shy away from raw vocals, hard music, and pulling lyrics, but this was a bit too much. Every song has that throaty yell that has become a trademark in hard core rock. And to discover that the lead reveres Charles Manson?? That, I must say was a turn off.This is certainly not a horrible CD. But it is not the best I won. I still love Chop Suey! but can't say that about any of the others songs on this CD."
4,"""best ever for S.O.A.D.""","This album was the best thing ever to happen to S.O.A.D. It has the best S.O.A.D. song's made to date(even better than some songs on ""Mezmerize""). This is what put them on the map. A lot of people probably didn't know who S.O.A.D. before this album. Toxicity is by far their best work yet, with songs like ""Chop Suey"", ""Toxicity"",""Deer Dance"", and ""Arials"" all becoming names of songs that even MTV watchers would recognize. I believe even ""Mezmerize"" may not even be able to top this one."
3,system of a down at it's best,Toxicity rocks. This album different than their debut but just as good if not better. system of a down are a bit more grown up now and not quite as weird. Prison song and Chop suey! are stand out tracks.Toxicity is well worth the money
3,Really 3.5 stars...,"Usually I don't follow ""death-metal"" groups like SOAD seems to be, but this is one of the few groups that i do like. The other difference between them and most other bands that I like is that I don't concentrate on the lyrics as much-while they're important, I don't believe in a lot of what he says, but they do make me think a lot (just look at the monologues in Prison Song, or the rubber-bullet-service-with-a-smile line in...well I'm not sure which one). When they're not concentrating on government or groupies, they DO have some interesting thoughts (Bounce-a pogo stick? I love it), and musically, they're very talented. Middle easter influences with hard metal...really nice. The singer I like and that guitarist is cool...in a freaky sort of way. I'm not sure if I will get their self titled, but when they put another one out I will certainly take much more interest in it than I did with this one at first."
4,I hate the cover of the album so i wont buy it.........,"People that wont like this CD without even listening to it properly are:1)People Traped in the 70's ( I want more solo's!!!).2)People who think someone who has darker skin then white is a terrorist.( Kill all Sand N%%g%S)3)People who love George Bush ( What a ragga muffin he is i love that chap).4)People who dont know nothing about politics.This aint an AMAZING album but it is good. Reminds me of a heavy version of Mr Bungle, not as diverse though.It uses influences from varios different metal genres, so i wouldnt label it Nu-metal( Korn, Limp bizcuit talk about the same things and play similar music?)Any way every one has an opinion i guess, but make it a bit valid."
2,The System Let Me Down,"Gave this CD a whirl after hearing so many people rave about it and I still can't find why it's a good CD at all. I'll give credit to the song ""Aerials"" because it's just awesome and different; however, the rest of the CD didn't ever seem to lyrically grab me and I got tired of the leader singer's same vocal pattern on every single song. I thought this CD would yield yet another rock band for me to like but unfortunately it seems too monotonous in structure and almost disjointed at points. I hope this band does some more fine tuning and gives more variety in singing style but also in the way they produce songs that can at least be deciphered somewhat on the first listen, not unintelligible until the fifth or sixth listen."
2,quite good,"this is a very critical album. the songs like forest ""why can't you see that you are my child?"" yeah that's quite a good question... chop suey! is one of the greatest songs ever!"
4,good smells though,soo......new SOAD cd.....its quite entertaining and stuff yet it's odd............but its all good......better than the first.....worse than the 3rd............soooPeace Out...
2,"Not bad, but not that good either.","Well, I bought this album based upon the three songs I heard on the radio: Chop Suey!, Toxicity, and Aerials, and frankly I am dissapointed. This album is a hit and miss. On one hand it has some great songs on it, but on the other a few songs (namely Jet Pilot and X) bring it down. The only non-radio song on here that I have learned to like is Science and maybe Bounce (mainly for its comic value.)The band does have some talent, and they do have a unique sound to them. However, I think that if they trimmed off some of the lower quality songs on here, the album would have been better."
4,Good effort,"Good effort, most issues coverd on here are political. So it would not be everybodies taste. Musically it goes in different directions of metal/alternative, it certainly isnt complex music but it is not dull either. Definatly worth checking out."
3,What's the big deal??,"I don't get what's so great about this album. I mean, it's a zillion times better than ""Hybrid Theory"" by Linkin Park, but come on, A MASTERPIECE?? Masterpieces are ""Schizophrenia"" by Sepultura and ""Powerslave"" by Iron Maiden. The first album is slightly better than this, because none of the songs from that one get heavy airplay like ""Chop Suey"" from here does. Best songs are ""Prison Song"" and the title song, but ""Bounce"", ""Needles"", and ""Psycho"" are pretty bad. ""Aerials"" has a great intro but other than that, it's really not a great song. I feel this album is VERY overrated."
4,SOAD,"System of a Down's sophomore album is criticized as being a terrorist album because it came out on 9/11...and because the band members are from a middle eastern nation originally.I'm not surprised, but dissappointed by these racist rants. For one, Armenia is near the middle east but is a Christian nation, not Islamic. For another, even if they were Islamic, it doesnt make them terrorist. What is a terrorist anyway? Christian nations who take over entire nations, exploit resources, destroy cultures, enslave humans, and enforce Christianity? The governments involvement in Iraq is a terrorist act in itself. The events of 9/11 have no connection with Iraq besides stupid Americans who group all of the Middle East and its inhabitants as one collective. There is no hope for this sad country which continues embracing racism even in music, the only thing good in this corrupt world."
4,A good effort,"SoaD has put out a very good disc with TOXICITY. It was probably one of the most anticipated metal releases this year and it doesnt disappoint. The album has some great melodies to go aling with some straight ahead in your face rock. (Chop Suey) It also has some pretty amusing lyrics (Needles). DEER DANCE is also a great song on this disc. Some of the lyrics are serious and try to make the listener think. JET PILOT, BOUNCE, ATWA, FOREST, and AERIALS are also some of the stand outs here that you will want to listen to. Get this CD now"
4,Major Step Forward,"Let me start off by saying that I didn't care for the last album.This one however is light years ahead of the debut. Sonically it is phenominal, they got great sounds this time out.The songs are heavier and less quirky than the debut. There are some awesome heavy riffs with great grooves, however there are still some of the annoying (IMO) vocal interludes. Basically I tolerate these to get to the cool parts, fortunately those ""coolparts"" pay off big. Just saw them for ""Pledge Of Allegiance""and they were outstanding live."
5,Best metal album I own!!,"There is one thing wrong with this album and that is it made me like their s/t effort less. Although there is no 'Sugar' on this album it is pure quality from start to finish. The only song i don't love is Jet Pilot because I think its a bit too heavy in all the wrong ways but its still a good track. Best songs for me were Chop Suey, Forest and ATWA.I reckon Serj is the main reason that SOAD are a brilliant band rather than just a good band but every member pulls their weight. In short a modern day classic."
4,A good album that is not for everyone.,"I am not a fan of the nu-metal scene, but I just had to get this album. My favorite songs on this album are Prison Song, X, Chop Suey!, Forest, the title track, and Ariels. If you are not a fan of the nu-metal scene but would like at least one nu-metal album, let this be the one. Then again, this may not be for you.First half: 3 out of 5Second half: 5 out of 5"
3,band with great potential shown in songs like chop suey,If system of a down could make an album with songs all like chop suey and toxicity they would be the greatest band of the century. well maybe not that good.But why do they not use the vocals displayed in chop suey throughout the whole album? Chop suey is without a doubt the best song on the album. They had great music and vocals in chop suey if these qualities were present throughout the whole album I would give it a five.
4,system of a down,Great album. Love the unique sound this band has.I would recommend it. Amazon makes it easy to find music.
5,This Great Album!,"It was great! I thoroughly enjoyed listening to this! This is one of my favourite albums by system of a down, and now I finally have it!"
1,Pathetic Substitution for Music...,"This is bad. Not even music. All it is, is a bunch of guys yelling at the top of their lungs talking about sniffing drugs and about killing people. I was open enough to listen to this whole CD. Not for me."
1,junk,this is the worst band i have everheard in my life. I would rather listen to debbie gibson all day long.their politics are lame and their chord changes are boring and uncreative.more like the worst cd of 2001.
2,Um......,"Ok..... Chop suey is the only good song on this cd.. if u expect that this cd will be like there Last LP that's where your wrong.. they seem to have a christian\gospel touch...insted more of a heavy metal\rock touch... if u want some real metal\rock try Slipknot,Static-x,Disturbed,Slayer,pentara and more artists like that."
1,this album has one use and one use only,"and when i say this i dont mean it to be used as entertainment or for enjoyment. when i first heard chop suey i thought the band would be worth a shot. when i popped in the cd i thought my dad was yelling at me, but it was only the music. the album is nothing like chop suey, only one other song is remotely good #8 i think. i like bands like offspring greenday ect., even rob zombie & limp bizkit. so if u like that kind of music then dont waste your money on this recording of rythmless shouting. and when i say the album has one use, it makes a nice frisbee"
1,System of a turban,"I may not be 14 or hip to what the kids today listen to. But with lyrics like ""I dont think u trust in my self righteous suicide"", a video of the lead singer wearing a shirt with a tank on it,a song called jet pilot and another song that starts out with ""there is toxicity(anthrax) in our city. Even I know its obvious. These guys support terrorsim. If you have your doubts read the back cover of their first album, it discusses how in the 21 st century the world will experience biological and chemical terrorism to combat the opression of those in foreign lands.Oh and not to mention the upside down american flag on the back of the record.Now maybe this is all just a coincidence.NahhDont support terrorism and dont buy this album"
5,Toxicity,"This album rules. Since the last release, ""System of a Down"", the group has been touring alot, and Terj, the lead singer, has developed greatly. All the tracks are excellent, especially Chop Suey! and Aerials. The bonus CD-Rom has some great features for any big fan."
5,buy this album. now. that's an order,"Buy this album now. It is so incredibly rich sounding...like eating pure butter but in convenient music form. Smooth, mellow, strange, quirky, and at times incredibly hard...buy it now."
2,where'd the creativity go?,"This album is a big disappointment. Their self titled album caught me by surprise- i liked ""Sugar"" and was really shocked to hear that the rest of the album was just as good and better in some places. They had catchy guitar work,crunchy rythms and those intense vocals. Now the lyrics are just annoying with simple phrases screamed over and over. There's no melody in these songs, and the guitar is nowhere near where it was on the last album. The last album was so much more creative. Toxicity sounds like what you'd get if you asked some teenage SOAD tribute band to make some new songs. What happened?"
2,Oh so disappointed,"I bought this release based on the merits of the two singles which made the airwaves. When I first heard them I was psyched that here was a band with a great new sound that was powerful, raw, and original in a world of mediocrity.Then the CD came. Boo.Aside from the two singles the rest of the album delivers the same old same old... yelling and screaming about injustices in the world and overcrowded prisons and displaced youth, blah, blah blah. I couldn't tell where one song ended and the next began. Look, if these guys ever did spend time in an overcrowded prison or got hit with rubber bullets, then I'll raise the rating.. or maybe if they reveal that half their record sales from their record deal go to amnesty intl. then OK they get a four out of five. But c'mon.... Rage Against the Machine did this already. We don't need anymore preaching guys, let alone screaming nonsense about the government."
1,Not all that Great! This cd kinda gets on your nerves,their first cd was ok but this cd really gets on your nerves the constant chage from singing to screaming sucks because the do it so often. I mean the first album was great and then this one pushed the anyoying limitations that the first one only mildley had. So if you really want a good cd go get Reveille's Bleed the sKY which actually has a good lead singer and doesn't change from fast guitar playing to slow anoying songs all the time.
1,"Softer, weaker and not System of a Down","I really can't believe how ""melodic"" (wussy) this cd was. I waited anxiously to buy it and when i did, i was so disapointed at the way SOAD changed. If the only song you liked off their first cd was ""Spiders"", then you will love this cd. If you preferred the real hard core metal sounds of SOAD, then I'm afraid you'll be sorry if you buy it. I hope their next cd sounds more like the first than this ... sequel."
3,Toxicity DVD Review,"OK, on this review I'll talk about the mini-DVD. If you wanna review on the music read my review of the normal-version ""Toxicity"", not this or the red covered one.The DVD includes 4 things:The music video for ""Toxicity"", which is really cool, but I'm sure you've seen it, and 3 live performances, which are for ""Chop Suey!"", ""Bounce"", and ""Prison Song"". I like the music video and the music, but what takes away from it is that each performance is in the same place, and nothing really special happens in them, so, if you wanna good System of a Down live DVD, get the one that's (I think) is coming out in mid-summer. OK, I'm done now."
4,Do it yourself,"I'm no expert on tuning or installation, but I was in much need of getting more fuel to my engine. It was running extremely hot after installing an exhaust and air filter.Relatively easy to install, bit of a tight fit. In fact the installation mount had to be improvised as it wasn't the same as indicated in the manual for 2008 FXDF.In any case, easy fit in, install the software on a laptop. restart laptop after installation (OTHERWISE WON'T DETECT THE Power Commander), load the map you want and run it."
4,"Good,but...","Way too short. 37 minutes of videos,(though they are very good videos), is not my idea of a DVD worth the money paid. How would it have hurt to add a couple of more songs to this?"
1,not worth the money!,I thought this would be a good card game for our then 5 year-old. It held no interest whatsoever. It has just been sitting around so we finally gave it away as a donation.
4,Aleady have the seperate albums,"The other review was very helpful. I already own those albums.In fact I own just about ALL of his albums. He IS my favorite.For those that don't have them - get them. Well worth the money.Enyoy,"
3,A Fanatic's review,"I am a Neopets online fanatic,so I know a lot about the Neopets.I would say that it is a very confusing.I'd like better animation,knowing of our technology.But,it is a fun little toy for VERY long trips."
2,Not that great,I was really looking forward to being able to take care of neopets away from my computer but was VERY disappointed!
5,A Great Book,This is a great book about the life of John Wayne. I think that any fan of his will be pleased with the way it was written. One of the best books written about his life.
5,From a Duke Fan,"I bought this for my Dad for Christmas- we are both HUGE John Wayne fans, and he loooves it, and so do I. HIGHLY recommend it- must have for any and all Duke fans :)"
4,Very Interesting Book,Enjoyed this book very much. Realy got to know the people in this book am looking forward to reading the second book
3,Not Getting It,"This documentary has been receiving accolades and I really didn't think it was done very well. The daughters are wonderful at telling their stories and talking about what they have done with their lives. However, their brother (the filmmaker) is judgmental of them which really bothered me. I was an abused child and I maintained my relationship with both parents until they were in their 80s. It is much more typical for abused children to maintain a relationship with their abusive parent than for them to walk away. Its ironic that the one child who was not abused, the filmmaker, was the one who cut off ties with his parents. I give the sisters huge props for never playing the victim and going on with their lives to the best of their ability. However, I think their story could have been told in a fairer, less judgmental and more emotionally rich way."
2,Family Affair Review,I believe it would have been in the best interest for the film maker and his family to go for counselling instead of doing the film. It appeared to me that the lifetime damage done to this family had not been addressed to professionals for healing. Making money and achieving awards as a result of the documentary isn't going to heal these individuals. As a health professional I'd say this is a sad and disturbing film with no resolution.
3,A beginner's general dog book; not specific enough on Chessi,"Although a good, general source of information on dogs, out of the 120 page book, only about 30 pages involve Chessies, specifically. I was disappointed, and would not recommend it, unless the only Chessie book available (which it isn't). Too much advertising specific brand-name products, not enough Chessie stories."
4,Excellent for Female Infertility & Ave. for male infertility,"If you want one book to do it all, get this one.At least it provides you with a vision of most of the issues surrounding infertility.It provides excellent information on female infertility issues.It provides cursory information about male infertility issues.We have recommended and loaned out this book to several friends, and they all were happy with the details provided."
4,A highly technical resource book.,"This is a very comprehensive book, filled to the brim with information for the infertility patient. It's a great resource, but some parts are written in a very technical way, with a lot of medical terminology. I didn't read it from cover to cover, but do use it often as a resource."
3,Medically accurate but limited...,"This book does not offer everything you need to know. It will help you self-diagnose your infertility problem, but it does not offer much information past the original diagnosis. There is not enough info about the specific diseases or treatments beyond a cursory medical explanation and a description of IVF,GIFT,etc.(this is probably a great book if you are primarily interested in these alternatives). I would have liked to have seen more information regarding natural methods to use with or instead of assisted reproductive methods. It's a large book to buy for such a limited range of topics."
2,Looked very good until I found serious factual inaccuracies.,"I was very impressed with this book until I read the text of pgs. 168 and 169 where the author states that the drug DES was found to be harmful to prenatally exposed offspring in the 1950's and quickly removed from the market. He goes on to state that a woman born in 1965 with reproductive abnormalites like those caused by DES could not possibly have been exposed to DES ""since DES had been removed from the market.""In fact DES was found to cause reproductive harm in the 1940's but not banned from use in pregnant women until 1971. This physician is spreading inaccurate, potentially harmful ""information."" In light of this widely understood information that DES was not taken off the market for use in pregnant women until 1971, this reviewer has to place in consideration the accuracy of the other information in this book. The information as to the active time period of des use is not obsure and widely available to professionals in this field"
1,This book stinks!,I did not find this book to be helpful & my IVF nurse laughed and told me to get a refund when I showed it to her.
3,More DES info at http://www.desaction.org,"An earlier reviewer mentioned DES and it made me curious. Used google search on DES (diethylstilbestrol) and found lots of info, including www.desaction.org. Anyone curious about fertility should educate themselves on this issue.I've not read the book, but could not add this comment without specifying ""stars"", so i picked the middle. Shoot me."
3,Not a bad read but not as hilarious as I was told.,"I recently finished Sisterchicks on the Loose. I had heard at a librarian's book sale that the Sisterchicks series was laugh-out-loud funny. Well, I wouldn't exactly say that. The story did have some humourous parts, but it certainly didn't make my sides hurt with laughter. Maybe it's just me, but I thought that Sharon's character was a bit of a mooch. Plus, her friend Penny was quite flighty and slightly off her rocker. I also thought that they were making an awfully big deal about being in their 40's. Come on people...40 is the new 20 :)I shouldn't pan the book entirely. It was enjoyable. I especially liked reading about life in Finland. If it is anything like the book describes, I wouldn't mind visiting there one day!"
5,I never wanted this Book to end,"This book is a must read if you have ever had a ""Best friend"" thier wild adventure will inspire you to wake up and want to live life to it's fullest! The author keeps you on your seat of excitment to see what happens next. Sisterchicks forever!"
5,Funny - loveable - great!,"Robin has a lot of teen fans who are growing into young adulthood and womanhood. Its great that she has moved into fiction for an older crowd so her fans can grow with her.Sisterchicks is great and there's a website for fellow ""sisterchicks"" to meet at: http://www.sisterchicks.com"
4,Two Old Ones,Two of Johnny Cash's oldest albums of which only Fabulous Johnny Cash has been available on CD until now. These are also two of the very few Johnny Cash albums that Columbia has released on CD - it would be great if they stopped making all these Best Of and Greatest Hits albums and started re-releasing the actual albums or let Bear Family make some more of the wonderful Man in Black boxes. This album includes some of songs which are also found on these Greatest Hits etc. Songs like Don't Take Your Guns to Town and Five Feet High and Rising. But it also includes a lot of songs which have never been released on CD (save for the Man in Black boxes). With this CD you get two old albums and the original liners notes. And if you haven't got them on LP already you will hear a lot of new songs.
2,Disappointed With Sound Quality,"This looks like a nice set, but my first quick listen revealed that the sound recording quality is not sophisticated."
4,Fierce instrumental genius in between psychedelic haze,"At times ripping deeper then most fusion jams ever dare go, the overall effects are again sometimes weighed down by the reluctant lulls of drugged out, less inspired distortionesque improv- even so, which is demonstrated with more eloquence then in future releases. With these two seminal albums fused together though, one can hardly pause from admiring the daunting collaborations each band member intuitively made in order to synchronize some of the most jazzily adept experimental rock music ever laid down. Some of it's slower(free-form) parts may alienate the melodic minded, sober listener, although it would be a crime to not own this compilation if at all one is instrumentally inclined."
4,Great component tester,"This meter is a versatile meter for testing of electrical components. It is not rated for branch-circuit or service application, and that does limit it's functionality some. But for bench testing of components and devices it works great."
5,Its Big.,Very nice multimeter. It's on the large side but the leads are plenty long so you can do your work and see exactly whats on the display!
5,ITS GREAT. I GOT WHAT I PAYED FOR!,"I GOT THIS PRODUCT AT WALGREENS AND I WAS SCEPTICAL B/C OF THE NAME BUT I GET ON YOUTUBE ALOT AND SEE PRODUCTS REVIEWS SO I DECIDED TO TRY IT. GOOD THING I DID. I WASHED MY HAIR WITH GIOVANNI TEA TREE TRIPLE TREAT AND THEN CONDITIONED WITH THIS PRODUCT,I KEPT IT ON FOR ABOUT 20 MINS IT SAYS 10 BUT I HAVE DRY HAIR SO I DECIDED TO KEEP IT ON A LITTLE LONGER. IT LEFT MY HAIR SOFT AND SMELLING WONDERFUL. I DO SUGGEST DOING ANOTHER DEEP CONDITIONER AFTERWARDS FOR DRY HAIR, BUT THE RESULTS ON MY 4B/4C HAIR WAS GREAT. THE SMELL WAS ABSOLUTLEY YUMMY AND THE PRICE IS MAJOR PLUS. TRY IT ASAP!!!!"
5,Essential for the clueless soccer dad,"Our five year-old started getting into soccer and I immediately found myself over my head with even the basics of the sport. This DVD gave us a bunch of great exercises and ideas and inspiration for him. He is six now and is showing amazing ability (if you knew our family's level of athletic talent you'd understand better why I used the word ""amazing."") and I am actually a semi-qualified assistant coach."
5,Great Resource for Parents and Their Soccer Players,"With no background in soccer, I was at a loss, and as a new soccer player, so was my son. I took advantage of the ""Parent Soccer Coach"" DVD as a tool for our family's mutual ""Soccer Education"". My son enjoyed watching the DVD and used it to reinforce what he was learning on his team. He also seemed to get a lot of self-affirmation from the DVD by pointing out his knowledge & skills.This DVD offers an easy & convenient way to build awareness of soccer for the entire family."
3,Not bad but not for U-8,This had a lot of good drills for kids over 9 years old. My 8 year olds it was way too confusing. I wish there was more on position play and strategy.
2,global puzzle,"poor Adam Crall, reviewer. Cameroon is its own, French-speaking nation in Africa. It is NOT in South Africa, which is also an independent nation."
2,596 piece puzzle,"Brand new out of the box my wife and I completed this puzzle, almost. All except Quebec, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland. One random piece I would have blamed myself. But four? And all connected to each other? Not a coincidence. Someone at the factory really doesn't like Canada.Otherwise, a fun puzzle but not really for kids. Hope you have a stable table because the countries don't interlock so everytime you bump the table, even just a little, it's an earthquake.Took me over half the puzzle to figure out the facts and info written on the oceans were alphabetized. It was easy after that.It wasn't a total waste. It killed a rainy afternoon for my wife and I. So if you like geography and don't mind incomplete puzzles, this is the puzzle for you."
2,Deceptive Advertising,Don't be fooled by the perfect cut of the countries on the box cover. I bought this for my [...] thinking the pieces were actually in the shape of the countries and it would be a good learning tool. Not quite. Some were. Most were not. Some countries were so small they were difficult to read. This will be in our next garage sale.Springbok puzzles are still the best.
3,missing pieces,Hello - Please be aware that if you buy this puzzle there are two pieces missing. Morocco and Costa Rica kind of frustrating in one was going to frame it! But overall a good value took 2 adults about 10 hours to put together.
1,bad purchase,Wish I wouldn't have wasted my time and money. Quit working after a few uses. This product was very cheap and a item I wouldn't recommend.
3,"I was not thrilled with this book, but that doesn't mean someone else won't like it.","Since I haven't been around women like the boss's daughter,who thinks of the hero as a new plaything, I got tired of the story. I am always amazed how G.L.Hill can weave a story and put good christian values in them . I admire that ."
3,Bahzell Bahnakson can still kick butt,"The main problem with this book is that most of the time it does not focus on our giant champion friend and his companion, but rather on a female interest that really does not contribute much to anything.I am probably being to hard on the book because it is the middle of the serise where most books regardless of their genera tend to go momentarily flat. I thought the book was O.K but I will not reread the book agian and agian like I did with War God's Own and Oath of Swords.Overall-I really should not be this disappointed over a book I know but I waited for 6 years and got my hopes up. My mistake."
3,Another Disappointment,"First, let me say I have followed David Weber from the beginning of his writing career. I enjoy his writing style very much. But this novel is typical of all his latest books. The multitude of subplots make it confusing and detract from his style. The characters are flat and inconsistent; they don't jump out of the page at you and they don't make the reader want to empathize with them. But most of all, David Weber has began to specialize in massive info-dumps, paragraph after paragraph of detailed exposition, which only manages to slow down the pace of the story.I still buy his books in the hope he will return to his earlier form. Since I doubt that will happen, I will probably stop buying them."
5,Very good.,What you would expect from this author. Story could have moved a little faster. A good continuation in the series.
4,It just ends,"It's an excellent book, but it just... ends. There's no wrap up. No satisfying conclusion, nothing. I only hope there are a couple more in the works."
4,Irrestible speghetti western albeit poor quality,"This movie has all the trappings of a classic western tale enthusiasts have come to expect: gambling in saloons, dancing women, dusty country-weathered men, gun fights and riding off into the sunset. The traveling circus element was great comic relief and I laughed out loud at the scene of 3 or 4 little clowns swinging bats to take down a giant villain! I think folks are judging it to harshly based on the quality of the DVD. I admit, in the beginning the aspect ratio is squeezed together to fit TVs and the picture looks elongated, this is annoying. Then this technique is switched to just chopping of the sides of the wide screen original. Regardless of quality issues, I soon became engrossed in the story and couldn't help but enjoy movie overall."
1,Boot Hill,The movie was pretty slow and the voice over for Terence Hill was completely different than his voice in other movies. Not the same slap stick western you'd expect from Hill.
2,Eastern Western,"Entertaining, low buget western. Plot a little hard to follow. Not exactly Terence Hill's best movie. Watch it."
1,Boot Hill,The picture quality sub VHS standard. I'm a fan of Terence Hill films but this was by far the worst I've seen. I would not recommend this to anyone.
1,Disappointing and deceptive,"Poor quality recording, and though it calls itself ""Trinity Rides Again"" it is not a Trinity movie and lacks the humor and characterizations I was expecting."
2,Poor picture,The picture quality was terrible. I feel there was no in-studio adjustment to improve on the picture quality. Just felt cheated!
2,Horrible!,"I was very disapointed when I saw this.Knowing Terence Hill was in it I was expecting something a ton better.Big disapointment.Good cast,but bad movie."
3,not his best,had to have it though. like the trinity movies. have all of the others also. Boot Hill is not Terrence Hill's best though. not the traditional bambino.
2,OK genre piece for completists of Spencer/Hill films,"One of the three ""Cat Stevens"" films that immediately preceded the breakthrough ""Trinity"" films, Terence Hill and Bud Spencer are not yet in the full characters they are famous for. The film is interesting mainly for the glimpses of how the Trinity/Bambino characters were developed. Do not expect comedy, although there are a couple moments of it. Directing OK but film shows its age and circus scenario will be too exotic for many tastes. Some viewers will find the film more dull than moody or stylish (as the director seemed to intend). Film was pretty well received by audiences in the late 1960s, according to the Hollywood Reporter."
1,Didn't Live Up to Expectations,I should have recognized that given the age of this film that the DVD print would be of such low quality
4,Quite interesting...,"I didn't think I'd like this book as much as I actually did. It was informative, questioning, and thought provoking. Great for someone who knows little about ecological literacy but wants to know more. A good beginner's book for someone starting to realize the intrinsic value in nature."
4,esay to recognize,it's very easy to recognize about leadership. i read more books about leadership more than 20 books. you know what? this books has importants keys of leadership on techinical side.
3,Not All 12 Herbs Germinated,"This herb kit came well packed. The seeds were in individual little plastic ziploc baggies. I put the seeds in a seed starter tray, watered, and set in a warm location with partial sun. Five of the twelve germinated. I re-planted the empty trays and five more germinated. After the third try, I still only have ten of the twelve herbs. The parsley and sage are the two that did not germinate. I will try again with those two. Overall, this is a good herb kit if you have patience. It will take a lot of months before I can cook with them."
1,old seeds and small qty,I was sent seed packets that where packaged for spring 2010. I doubt those are going to grow but guess I'll see. There werent very many seeds in them either. And good thing I had other planting instructions because the packets didn't desplay deepth to plant the seeds or if the plant liked shade or sun. Some packages only made 2 1/2 six packs once planted. One packet of seeds should make at least 5 or 6 sixpacks.Thought I was getting a deal but got less seeds and old seeds when I could have went to Homedepot and got better stuff for $2 more. Wont be buying seeds from this Generic Company anymore.
2,Worth it?,Haven't used yet. Long shipping time. Not refrigerated/yet told to upon receival. High shipping cost. Hard to find seeds.
4,Most Grew!,"I bought this product with the intention of growing them. I followed the instructions of each individual packet, and placed the seeds in the greenhouse with proper heat and water. The majority of the seeds have grown, such as echinaea, milk thistle, burdock, lemon balm, and cayenne. I have not gotten fever few to sprout after a few attempts. It is still a good purchase and they shipped immediately."
5,Victoria and Albert,The story of Victoria and Albert relationship developing over the years is told so well.From first meetings to marriage and the adjustment of Albert as a man to wait for his duties to evolve overtime.It is so sad how tragic Albert's early death had on a young Quenn Victoria and for the effect of Albert's death on the rest of Victoria's reign. A True love story.
4,Worth watching,"I had seen the movie ""Young Victoria"" so I wanted to see how Victoria was portrayed as a matured queen. Although I was not disappointed, the setting was quite different, this movie did not have the glamour."
2,Disc #2 would not play on our blueray/DVD player!! dont know how to fix or exchange it.,"The Disc #2 would not play on our blueray/dvd player and I am very disappointed. Since it was shipped from Canada via Amazon, I do not know how to resolve the problem."
5,Surprising ...,"This is not a depiction of the ins and outs of the political aspect of Queen Victoria's reign. It is a love story where balancing duty with depth of feeling, professional with personal relationship, is fully fleshed out.All actors involved deliver great performances. Great chemistry between the lead actors makes the story come alive. It was wonderful to picture the castle, which looks so cold and austere from the outside, as the home of a warm and loving and joyful family. Children gleefully running through the halls on holidays. A father playing with his children. A mother looking on with shining eyes.This movie shows the personal side to the monarchy. It was a delight to watch. I hated to see it end.Add it to your DVD library and prepare yourself for a few hours of total enjoyment."
4,V&A,Lovely film -- great costumes. In terms of the relationship between the Queen and the Prince Consort - it seems accurate to the history I have read.
3,Pocket Neopets,"My advise at this price a good buy. I got mine for like 15 dollars and im dont know about that being a good price but anyway...Pocket Neopet is basiclly ok. The games are kind of boring and the whole layout is confusing. The games also only give out neopoints like 3 times a day (unless you play the slots which is boring), and there's hardly anything to do. It's nice because it has the little 3D thing to play with but get a diffenrt because theres no room to play with this one cause it has an ocean. Anyway whats good about is that it's very portable, durable, and it's fun to have your own little pet. It also alerts you when the neopets site is having a special day. It doesn't beep in the middle of the night and is pretty low maintance...You can also set it like alarm clock and you can put messages with the alarms!"
2,mmmmmmmmm?????????,"I did learn things I didn't know about 1969 Woodstock. But this DVD uses too much video from the oringial movie. There's hours and hours of film that was shot sitting in some Hollywood vault somewhere that could be used. If you enjoyed the original movie you don't really need to buy this one. To much of the same thing over again, althrough the short interviews where a nice touch."
3,a little disappointed,"It would screw up the '3 days ' concept , but I'd put a couple different groups on , and leave out the duplicates , or near so, to original- WHY more Sha Na Na ?? WHY no Sweetwater ?? ( better them than Quill ) duplicate Ten Years After and Hendrix ?? I'd have added Creedence & the Dead. again , that would screw up the '3 day' concept. and of course , who knows about the legalities ....besides the whining , a good show,it's always great to see Canned Heat , etc"
2,Very Dissapointing,"If you're interested in only buying this to listen to the interviews and comments of artists who were there, and finally getting to hear from Rosenman and Roberts, then by all means buy the DVD. But if you're buying it for the musical content you'll be very dissapointed. They edited a lot of the songs horribly and cut the life out of them."
3,Fun for little fingers,"My children love sliding open the pages to reveal the surprise hidden behind it. It's a great way for young children to learn characteristics of animals. For instance, it is the daddy penguin that sits on the eggs. Minor drawbacks are that the pages are sometimes hard to open or shut and that the illustrations do not seamlessly slide into each other."
3,Not a bad debut,"Depeche Mode's first LP is much more upbeat and dance-oriented than their later, post-Clarke work. While most of the songs here are very enjoyable, there is one major disappointment. This CD lacks the shorter single version of its best-known song, ""Just Can't Get Enough"", instead offering only an annoying extended mix."
3,Where the Great DM came from.,"If you are a devoted Depeche or electronica fan, then you need this, to complete your understanding. If you need to revisit your roots and you like the music that beat the soundtrack to the 1980's, then you need this. If you're outside of those categories, then this is a perfectly good example of the way good synth-pop was made, back in the days before people took the mick out of the casio keyboard sound, and it was damned good synth-pop too. Unfortunately for it, but fortunately for the four (now three) boys from Basildon, it's pretty much been eclipsed by the standard of work they've since produced. That doesn't make it a bad album though."
4,A good beggining.,"Depeche Mode appeared on the world with ""Speak and Spell"", their first album. The new romantic era has appeared,and Depeche Mode were the kings. On this album, there are good songs, like ""Dreaming of me"" and ""Tora Tora Tora"". It also contains Depeche's first classic: ""Just can't get enough"" I really recommend this album to everyone, but it is an all electronic album. If you're fan, you must have it, and if you want to know about music, it would be interesting for you to know the first album of one of the greatest bands of all the time: DEPECHE MODE."
5,Good Stuff!,"Eventhough Vince Clark sucks at writing some songs on this album, it is still one of my faves. If you're a die hard Depeche Mode fan, this album is a must have."
4,Depeche Mode,"I've just started listening to Depeche Mode not too long ago, and I fell in love with them instantly. Their music ranges from semi-religious to love to ideals. I love their music. The first song by Depeche Mode I ever heard was ""Strangelove"" and then ""Enjoy The Silence."" All of their music is great and I end up loving all their songs, as opposed to buying an album to listen only to maybe one or two tracks. Their music can be soothing or upbeat. You can dance to it or relax. They're a great band and I can't wait for their new album."
5,awesome,This is the version of Speak and Spell to own. It has great bonus tracks ( mostly b-sides of singles taken from the album ) plus the inclusion of Sometimes I Wish I Was Dead ( which Sire/Warner Brothers in the felt the need to delete from the US pressing of this album.) Great synth-pop. Silly lyrics. Total ear candy.
3,Prototypical early 80s synth pop,"The problem with Speak & Spell is that Depeche Mode recorded some flagrantly wimpy garbage (""Boys Say Go!,"" ""What's Your Name?"") and mixed it in with some excellent (albeit somewhat dated) synth pop a la Vince Clark (""Photographic,"" ""New Life,"" ""Just Can't Get Enough,"" ""Dreaming of Me""). Make sure you program your CD player to skip tracks 4 through 6 when listening to this album or be prepared for the impending sickness. If it were not for those few terrible songs, Speak & Spell would be one of the band's best albums. Note: the version of ""Photographic"" included on this album is significantly different than the one included on The Singles 81>85 (but both are highly recommended)."
2,A tentative beginning,"Though this album has three great singles, it has traits that many debuts carry: lots of filler and undevelopment, but promise. This is notable in the Depeche Mode colletion, if only because it was Vince Clarke's only album with the boys. However, he would go on to create better albums with Yaz and Erasure, and the rest of Depeche Mode would move into darker territory. Besides, some of this music sounds really corny and dated."
1,"Buy it for ""Ice Machine""","The only good thing about Speak & Spell is the fact that ""Ice Machine"" (best DM song ever, in my eyes) is on it... that is, if you have the version with the B-sides on it. The rest, while catchy, are downright wussy (especially this version of Photographic; go find the Some Bizarre version or a live version). The only other remotely listenable song on here is Tora Tora Tora! (though I wouldn't buy the standard album without the extra tracks just for Tora!)."
2,One of My Least Favorite DM CDs,"Right from the beginning, with track #1 (""New Life""), I pretty much knew what to expect from the rest of this CD: fluffy, upbeat synth/pop that made me feel like I was ODing on ""sweetness"". Comparing this CD to Depeche Mode's newer, more somber music, I was amazed at how different they sound now compared to twenty or so years ago--and thank god for the change, too. I know I wouldn't be a DM fan if all of their songs had remained like this.The only two decent tracks on ""Speak and Spell"" (or, at least, the two that I didn't outright hate) are #2 (""Puppets""), a medium-tempoed song with a catchy chorus, and #11 (""Just Can't Get Enough""), a high-energy, spunky track. The rest are just too cheesy and silly for me, in particular the two ""pretty boy"" songs: #4 (""Boys Say Go!"") and #6 (""What's Your Name?""). I've honestly heard catchier tunes on my old Nintendo system, i.e., Dr. Mario. Depeche Mode fan or not, you can skip this CD and not feel guilty about it."
5,P-R-E-Double T-Y!!!,"I got this album as a used record the other day just for fun, and now I expect I'm going to have to buy the CD anyway. Instantly recognizable as the work of Vince Clarke, master of the catchy pop tune and the cheesy lyric, there's not a weak point on this album. Side one has my favorite, ""New Life"" along with another single, ""Dreaming of Me"", and a few other songs you can't help but laugh along with. Side two shows shades of what is to come with a couple of tracks by Martin Gore, including my favorite DM instrumental of all time, ""Big Muff"". Even the tunes penned by Clarke are a little darker than usual on side two, including the extended mix of the smash single, ""Just Can't Get Enough""."
4,No SACD?,"That's because Rhino is now owned by the WEA group and they don't support SACD. They could have used DVD-Audio instead, considering all the trouble they went to creating surround versions. The DTS 96/24 tracks are decent IF you have a newer 96/24 DTS decoder, otherwise you'll get 48/24 output. This same problem will plague the upcoming Genesis reissues as well, you'll only get the SACD layer if you buy the import and that means the videos will be PAL format."
5,Excellent remaster....,"I couldn't ask for better sound and care for the album's restoration and re-release. If you've got the original CD edition, this remaster necessitates a repurchase. If you're a newcomer, SPEAK & SPELL is a real treat, displaying a young and perhaps naive Depeche Mode, with Vince Clarke as their main songwriter. A very memorable and trendsetting album. The bonus DVD's documentary is also first-rate."
2,buy the import !!!!,"If you must have Speak and Spell ( which is quite good, despite being very lightweight, fluffy, lyrically empty early-eighties synth-pop ) do yourself a favour and spend the extra money on the import version. The US version pales in comparison to the original Uk version. There is a great song ( Sometimes I Wish I Was Dead, which is not as depressing as its title would suggest ) that was left off the US pressing, and the extra time was taken up by the inclusion of the 12"" remix of Just Can't Get Enough (which is better in its original 7"" mix anyway - over six minutes of Just Can't Get Enough is, well, too much of enough ). There are also a few great b-sides that are on the UK version of the cd."
3,Not their best album,"I bought this item simply because it was Depeche Mode (one of my favorite bands) and I didn't recognize any of the track listings. I later found out that was for a reason. I didn't much care for this album in particular. If you are a die hard Depeche Mode fan like I am, go ahead and buy it. If you are just now checking out the band, try a different CD instead."
3,solo para fanaticos,"Apto para fanáticos de la primera época, bueno el albun falta una estampa para el disco para que quede mejor"
3,Van Helsing meets The Excorcist,Overall this movie was entertaining if not all that original. The story follows the adventure of John Constantine (Reeves) who is a modern day excorcist with angst. Rachel Weisz plays a detective whose psychic sister commits suicide and she and Reeves try to uncover a plot by demons to enter the real world. The special effects of the film were good and the story was interesting even if it became a little predictable by the end. Overall a decent action flick in the same vein as Van Helsing.
4,Satisfying your supernatural cravings,"If you like battles against ultimate evil, religious overtones, and special effects - with a twist, rent Constantine. Yes, you have to suspend disbelief. Yes, you have to accept somewhat two-dimensional personalities. But if you get past that, you get a nicely shot, tense, supernatural crime saga with a couple of interesting characters. Most folks will have never heard of Constantine or Hellblazer, on which the movie is loosely based, but it's fine if you haven't. The movie is good enough on its own for an enjoyable night."
3,The Script was Poor,"This is a decent film with very good special effects, but the script was laughable at times. The white outfit that the devil wore had me confused as to whether he was a 'good guy' or not and Gabriel's tight outfit was better suited for a partygoer than for an angel. There were other things like the dialog, which seemed weak or corny at times and the fact that the film seemed to struggle with itself for an identity; was it a horror or a weak action film? I felt that the good elements of the film barely outweighed the bad hence my rating; however, I definitely wouldn't buy the DVD."
3,Sound!!!!????,"I enjoyed the movie very much. However, what was up with the sound quality. I had to turn up my volume in order to hear them speak. The music was loud and the vocals were very low. Some one should check these movies before they go out to the public. A movie is no good without sound! I watched the whole movie with the subtitles on. In case your wondering, I have surround sound so I played with different settings to see if I could improve the quality -- didn't work! I wonder if anyone else experienced this, or if I just got a bad copy!"
1,What a shameful letdown,"Shameful attempt at a hybrid of horror, action and suspends that cast Keanu Reeves as occult detective John Constantine in an adaptation of the vertigo comic book that loses it's edge and goes for the gusto in flat out stupidly with a boring acting turn by Keanu Reeves who just does not come across well in the role. The story just makes no sense at all and feels like it needed a good rewrite for everything to truly come together and the direction just does help move things along. Other than the great scene in which Rachel Weisz get torn out of a building, most of the special effects are not very good and could have been improved during post production. As for the rest of the actors, only Rachel Weisz manages to give a compelling performance despite the bad script in which she had to work with and Peter Stormare does a great five minute walk on as prince of darkness. Nether of them however can save this runaway train that should have been checked before it left the tracks."
1,"If this is the best they have to offer, then take it back","Bland rip off of a great comic book not only puts the worse actor imaginable for the main character but has a script that is almost a crime in itself. The dialog is so bad that it would even make deaf children cry and the special effects are not as good as one might hope. Some of the acting is great and that's a great feat in itself because of how bad the script is. Rachel Weisz, Djimon Hounsou and Tilda Swinton do great work here and for that, people should be grateful for but it's still Keanu's film and he still torpedo it with a lousy performance that is in tune with the lousy script it has.If this is the best they have to offer for the fans of the comic book, then take it back."
1,Horrible can't begin to describe this.,"Lamebrain horror film that not only rips off a much better film out there (The prophecy) but also lacks the thrills that movie had in spades. Keanu Reeves is still his same self here, which means that he gives another boring acting turn. His fellow co-stars do far more in their parts with Rachel Weisz being the stand out, giving a great performance that has resonance and guts. Djimon Hounsou is good as well but he's barley in the film and Peter Stormare give a great cameo that really should have been a bigger role. Weisz, Hounsou and Stormare give far more acting weight to this lame brain horror movie than it deserved and for that, they are worthy of the praise (Especially Weisz, who does lift this movie above the mediocre garbage it's really is.) but regardless of their worthy acting turns, the movie is plague by a script that really does not make any sense and a director who does not know how to direct a movie."
4,What's The Truth?,"It seems many of the worst reviews were written by the same person. Fake reviews are usually done to improve the rating by someone that could benefit from higher sales. Between bad reviews from people with an axe to grind and those promoting their own crappy movie, these reviews have become useless."
1,Another ten bucks I'll never see again,"Can Keanu spell ""typecast""? After those lousy Matrix sequels couldn't he have smelt the sulphur a mile away and dodged this sad excuse for a film?It's a tired formula - angels and demons are completely monstrous and amoral whereas us poor humans, the only creatures with any capacity for virtue, are stuck in the middle as their pawns. Not very original, not to mention cliche-ridden. Of course his friend (who is stereotypically geeky and likes to study arcane literature) had to die, just as he was trying to give Keanu some vital information! Of course there has to be a slow-motion scene where Keanu kills demon hybrids, a scene stolen straight from Blade. Of course he has to wear a long black coat.And suicides automatically go to hell?! Oh please. Time for filmmakers to stop adopting the dogma of a particular chuch and be more original. And what's with that horrendous depiction of the Angel Gabriel, androgynous, snooty and all but screaming fashion victim!"
2,Overblown Mess,"This is bad. Really. Perhaps it is one of those movies which can only be fully understood or enjoyed if familiar with the comic that originated it. It does not even have the redeeming quality of being a decent action film. Guilty of the worst capital sin of the kingdom of entertainment: boring, boring and boring. For that alone, it will burn in cinematic hell."
2,"Keanu Reeves: Dude, I was just attacked by a foot-soldier demon.","Other actor: No way!KR: Way! He was, like...a bunch of BUGS-n-stuff. But I kicked his ass.OA: NO WAY!!KR: WAY! Got a smoke?OA: Does the Pope wear a funny..oh, sorry dude. No offense.KR: Just give me the damn cigarette.Fade to white then to breathtaking shot of Rachel Weisz or Tilda Swinton."
1,Where is Mystery Science Theater 3000 when you really need it?,"Extremely awful Keanu Reeves stinker that not only lives up to the word of mouth but surpasses it in spades. Keanu proves once and for all on how bad an actor he is with a groundbreaking bad performance and a script that helps him out a lot in proving that. Only his co-stars come out of this film with their heads held up high with great performances by Rachel Weisz, Djimon Hounsou, and Peter Stormare but not even their great performances can salvage this disaster. This is fresh material for the show "" Mystery Science Theater 3000"" and I hope they can get a print of this movie and tear it apart for the garbage it really is."
1,Mindless Garbage,"Mindless Keanu Reeves film not only lacks a story for most of the stuff that happens in this film to make any sense but has some of the worse dialog known to man. Keanu is Keanu, don't expect much more than that and the special effects are decent but not superb. The script is a huge disservice to most of the cast and the climax of the film has no rhythm to it. The only actors in the film that manages to transcend the lackluster material given is Rachel Weisz, who gives a deep and rich performance that the film is not mature enough for and Peter Stormare, who does far more for this film than Keanu Reeves and the special effects combined.Other than them, you can skip the movie."
1,Skip it.,"Moronic and self indulgent Keanu Reeves vanity project lacks the heart and the wits of the comic book which it steals most of it's ideas form and ruins them with a horrible acting performance by Keanu Reeves, which looks more like he's reading from cue cards than remembering a script. The rest of the actors do better in their roles than he does with Rachel Weisz stealing the show with a deep and strong performance , Gavin Rossdale, doing a very convincing job as an agent of the underworld and Djmon Hounsou giving a bit role more class than he should have. Tilda Swinton does well with a small role that is very underwritten and Shia LaBeouf is well, Shia LaBeouf. Don't expect any more than that.Skip it, you will thank yourself after you see it when its on cable."
1,Dumb adaptation that does not try to be even remotely good,"Lackluster adaptation of the vertigo comic book that is only a fraction of the original source material and puts in a actor who can't live up to the character he is trying to play. Keanu Reeves fumbles badly with his role and the rest of the cast follows suite with the lousy script that make them all look like fools. Only Rachel Weisz and Peter Stormare come out of this cinematic debacle with their heads high because they do more than the script does in this film. They give more to their respective characters than they should have and make the film a little better than it really is and that's no small feat considering the fact that Keanu and the rest of the cast do look like fools thou out the entire film thanks to the badly written script and lackluster special effects.For Rachel Weisz and Peter Stormare, the film gets a four rating. The rest of the film does not even merit one."
1,"Other than the fine performances by Weisz, Hounsou, and Stormare, there is nothing here to see.","Mind numbingly bad Keanu Reeves film that makes you want to tear your hair out with Keanu giving his career worse performance and most of the actors giving theirs as well. The story is a clear rip off of horror movies from the past and it makes even the viewer feel stupid after it's all over. Only Rachel Weisz, Djimon Hounsou, and Peter Stormare are able to transcend their badly written characters and that's because they are too good of actors to be even in this mess.Hopefully Weisz, Housou and Stormare will learn to read their scripts better after this debacle."
2,"We all WANTED to like it, but it stinks.","Hmm.. I actually really like Keanu, but this was not a good role for him. If he had played it a bit more like Depp in 'Pirates...' it may have been ggoofy fun. The only amusement comes from Swinton and Stormare as Gabriel and Satan respectively. Plus, Gavin (Bush's frontman) is creepy enough. Weisz's performance is nothing special (her accent always stinks!).As people have said the story makes no sense. It is tentative in its storytelling... is this an action film or a religious film? Problem is it fails to be either or both. The only grace outside of Stormare and Swinton is that the visuals are cool.If you haven't seen this, just walk away, rewatch the Matrix or something like the Ninth Gate for creepy religous movies."
1,Pretty bad and pretty pointless.,"Pretty bad and pretty pointless Keanu Reeves vanity project that takes a well respected horror comic book and literally rips apart the complexity of it and makes it a joke with no story and no redeeming value to it. Of all the actors in the film, only Rachel Weisz manages to strike the right note and make you care about what is going on but other than her, you really don't give a damn about any of the characters and really don't give a damn about Keanu's attempt at drama.Avoid."
1,Dumb adaptation that does not try to be even remotely good or faithful to the comic book,"Lackluster adaptation of the vertigo comic book that is only a fraction of the original source material and puts in a actor who can't live up to the character he is trying to play. Keanu Reeves fumbles badly with his role and the rest of the cast follows suite with the lousy script that make them all look like fools.

The rest of the film does not even merit one."
2,Overburdened by Religious Overtones,"While the film includes some interesting visuals, it is bogged down by rather heavy-handed Catholic theology. If you don't subscribe to such beliefs, like me, you find yourself unable to care about the plot or see it as worth your effort to understand. All in all, I was rather bored by the end and found myself looking at the clock. It felt like I was watching the Catholic equivalent of the cheesy Protestant _Left Behind_ series."
3,How many demons does it take to kill Constantine?,"The dark load of semi-religious myth...them demonsand angels begin to behave the same?Fire and creepy monsters behind the walls of realitymake this more like alternate reality sci fithan a creepy horror show.Blue screen special effects are well doneand almost seamless, but the line between goodand evil is very blurred here.The sexy co-star is very like in the matrix series:not too pretty, but very interesting."
4,Watchable,"The idea is decent, the ending is sound, and Keanu Reeves plays his character in a way that reminds me of Agent Smith in the Matrix. I would give Constantine two thumbs up if Rachel Weisz and Tida Swinton had made it together, but that's just me. Since they didn't, it's a decent flick.Lower your expectations, have a few beers and enjoy."
2,One extra star for visual effects!,Truly a roller coaster ride that keeps on going to... NOWHERE land! Only extra star for the effects! PASS!
3,"Good concept, suffers from Keanu-itis","There was a lot to like in ""Constantine."" I'll leave aside the jumbled theology and event-driven plot. My feeling is the film was mis-cast from the beginning with Keanu Reeves in a suit. Can we all say ""NEO!"" in unison?The special effects were great, but nothing ground-breaking. The story-line was good, but not revolutionary. I have not read the graphic-novel, but I have been told that there were significant changes to characters on the whole.It is not a terrible film, but I'm convinced that it would have been a substantially better film if it had been Jude Law or Chris O'Donnell in that suit instead of Keanu."
2,"Yes, it's not very good.","I agree that the performance of Rachel Weisz was the best thing about this film, Unfortunately, that about the only good thing that I can say about this film because the rest of it is horrible. Keanu Reeves just does not come across as a credible main character and the story is not well thought out. The last twenty minutes of the movie take a downward fall into movie hell with one of the worse plot surprises in movie history and it reduces the movie into a standard Keanu Reeves action feast that has no brains what so ever. The special effects were done pretty badly and the direction is marginal at best and some of the scenes were too dark to notice what the hell was going on from time to time.I don't agree with the majority on allot of things but I have to say that they are right"
2,"boring, boring, and well, boring...",Keanu Reeaves is boring in this supernatural detective mystery. Good sfx and rachel weisz is always easy to look at but there is no plot worth mentioning...
4,creepy cool,"Constantine has accepted his fate and made peace with it. He knows that death and a hellish afterlife are imminent. Flawed and fatalistic, cigarette between his fingers, he plods along throwing himself into one horrific situation after another, in an effort to help a woman he doesn't even know. It's creepy and powerful. Angels, devils and friends. The guilty and innocent. Keanu Reeves is perfect in this role and it's a movie to watch again and again. Liked it a lot. Reminds me of Sandman Slim stories."
1,"O boy, this movie was really bad.","Horrible movie that leaves a very bad taste in your mouth with a bad acting performance by Keanu Reeves, who is miscast as a hard boiled detective who fights against demons in LA. His performance is a real misfire on the part of the people who made this film and it hurts the film in a lot of ways. His co-star Rachel Weisz is ten times the actor Keanu is and she has the most interesting character in the whole movie. Her character is so good that she should have been the lead instead of poor Keanu but we don't live in a perfect world so we have to suffer with Keanu trying to act tough. The script is an absolute mess from beginning to end and the special effects are not done properly in some scenes of the film.See the film for Rachel Weisz performance alone but other than her, wait for video."
1,The movie was horrible.,"Super crappy film that not only makes you feel stupid once you have seen it but will make you want to have a drink just to forget about it right after its over. Keanu Reeves is miscast in a very very bad way and the story is not very interesting at all. Certain thing that are introduce in terms of narrative in the beginning of the film is thrown out by the end of the second act in order to put on a ridiculous third act that makes everything about the movie into a bad and tasteless joke. Rachel Weisz does do wonders with the script and her role and the universal praise she is getting is well deserved but she gives the only good performance in the entire movie while the rest of the actors in the film can't rise above the bad material they are given. I did not even know that this was a comic book before but now that I do, I know why it was so bad to begin with."
1,Why did Warner Brothers release this garbage?,"This movie is garbage, stay home and save your money. My friendsand I were trying to stay awake through the entire film, although I don't know why. Sleeping would have been a more productive use of our time, rather than wasting time trying to figure out this film. When the old tired plot finally starts to unravel, we didn't care what was going on. I felt that the actors are an insignificant part of this movie, they don't matter. In other words, this film is so bad, it doesn't matter who was in front of the camera, no one could save this trash. The film is very dark, shot like a low budget film, with a few special effects.My friends and I can honestly say that we did not like anything about this film."
1,Mystery Science Theater 3000 fans would love this movie.,"Super stupid Keanu Reeves monster movie that is so bad, I'm waiting for it to come on Mystery Science Theater 3000. Keanu is at his worse with this film and it shows on his face that even he thinks the movie is bad. Out of the entire cast, Only Rachel Weisz(Runaway Jury) and Peter Stourmar(Bad Boys 2) give credible performances that are way better than the movie itself. Rachel Weisz does more with her part than the screenwriters and the director did with making the movie and gives the film an unnecessary great performance that a way better movie could have used instead and Peter Stourmar gives class and dignity to an underwritten role that is only in the movie for about five minutes.See it for Rachel Weisz and Peter Stourmar ONLY, because the rest of the film is really bad."
1,It's the Matrix all over again.,"Rip roaring rip off of the Matrix movies that has Keanu Reeves redoing his Neo character for a supernatural tale that does not have a lot of common sense. Keanu is pretty bad in this film and it's apparent that this was an attempt to cash in on his Matrix success and some of the things that happens in the film including the over blown ending are scenes taken directly from the Matrix films. It seems to me that they were trying to establish another franchise with Keanu but this film really does not deserve a follow up. There are some good thing to say about it like the performances of Rachel Weisz, who does do far more for this film with her great and powerful performance than it does for her and Peter Stormare, whose tem minute cameo has more meat and soul than most of the performances of the film (with the excerption of Rachel Weisz of course) . Other than them, the movie is really a vanity project for those who are looking to cash in on the Matrix movies."
1,This was pretty bad.,Lackluster adaptation of the vertigo comic book that is only a fraction of the original source material and puts in a actor who can't live up to the character he is trying to play. Keanu Reeves fumbles badly with his role and the rest of the cast follows suite with the lousy script that make them all look like fools.

1,Forgettable horror movie that is almost redeemed by Rachel Weisz's stellar performance,"Forgettable horror thriller that has Keanu Reeves remaking his matrix role for an even less talented director and an even worse screenplay. Keanu's performance is a worthy effort but is not very good and he's more distracting than compelling in his role. His costar Rachel Weisz does much, much more than he does in the acting department and almost redeems the entire movie with her stellar performance but she's literally the only actor who tries to be better than the horrible script that they had to work with. A script that lacks not only common sense but a sense of purpose as well. The direction is shoddy with really bad camera work in all directions and the special effects don't hold much significance.Other than a worthy and game effort on Rachel Weisz's part. The movie is not worthy of her talent or your time."
1,"Neo VS the devil and in the end, we all lose","Horrible Keanu Reeves action/horror movie not only makes the people who pay to see it look stupid but solidify him as one of the worse actors of our generation with a horrible performance that takes all the good this film had and destroys it with his sheer lack of talent. I feel sorry for his fellow actors which includes Rachel Weisz, (who give the movie's only real performance) for even being on the same screen with him because despite their good work, he manages to make the movie into a real choir to watch and that's in itself a crime because a better actor would have done more with the role.The bad word of mouth is justified."
3,A disappointment...,"I 'liked' the movie, but was not moved or engaged by it. The performances were adequate but not stellar, I was desparately trying to feel something for Constantine, and the other characters but just couldn't. The movie didn't reel you in like some thrillers, it was like being on the outside watching people do things that didn't seem to make much impact on their environment. The special effects were 'good', but nothing new.I guess some graphic novels don't translate well to film or the wrong person was doing the screenplay. I had hoped this movie to be intriguing, thought provoking, with action added to improve the flow, but got none of that...a disappointment at best."
4,Highly Enjoyable,"I thought this movie was entertaining and fun to watch. As for all the blasphemy complaints. Hello, people! Demons are made up, so taking liberty with terminology like ""half-breed"" is a non-issue. I, personally, was very happy with their good vs. evil-as-game theory. Cool."
4,i agree this a is good movie,"Constantine is based on the D.C. comics characters ""Hellblazer"",i also dont know too much about the comics, so was gradingjust as a film and have to admit it rocked the house!!!Way to go Keanu, the cast and director. Constantine has somegreat special effects, the acting is particulary good fromeveryone from Reeves to Rachel Weisz.He plays a sort of witchcraft doctor who performs exorcismsand gets rid of demons. Suddenly, well I dont want to revealtoo much, but lets just say that this movie is worth the moneyto see it in the theater. So see ""Constantine""!!!"
3,Not That Great,"I'm not a big Keanu Reeves fan to begin with, but this movie just didn't do it for me. Granted the viewer has to come into this movie with some prior knowledge of religion, but that aside this movie failed to entertain me. Gavin Rosedale does a pretty good job in what I believe is his first major acting job. Rachel Weis is solid as well. My gripe about this movie is the story, not the actors. You might find this entertaining, but I found it to be a waste of my time and money."
5,NOT A HORROR MOVIE!,"dont listen to any of the moron 1 star posters, they all complain that this is not a scary horror movie. thing is, this movie is not a horror movie you twats. This is more of a theological-sci/fi movie. There was nothing in this movie that disturbed me much, it was a well done movie, based on a comic book.i really liked this movie, and felt like i had to review it once i saww the streak of 1 star reviews, that could very well be all the same person."
5,the best,i don;t kno why they rated it so low. it is so a good movie. even my friend thinks so. keanu reeves played very good in this movie.im gonna buy it when it comes out. i keep talking about this movie to my friends.the movie is not all that scary maybe at the beginnig when they show a girl possesed. thats like the only cary scene. i think u should buy this movie. i am.
4,good movie,Great story line.....love the ending...when Constantine was face to face with Lou...it always gives me the creeps till this very day.
2,Constantine *blu ray*,Was happy to recieve the dvd fast but the quality (both image and sound) doesn't match to any of the blu ray discs I have at home.Looks like someone labeled DVD as bluray.
4,very good movie!,"very good movie, must have on blu ray. although mine was skipping on my ps3 for some reason. amazon was excellent in their customer service replacing the order."
2,Constantine,"A very nice movie. Overall audio is okay but the center channnel is soft on output. Whisper can hardly be heard. Dolby TrueHd is average. Switched to Dolby Digital, less compressed. Gabriel wing flaps can be heard. Now the center channel is much better. Visual just okay. Its a 50G disc."
3,Seems to be focused on killer special effects instead of decent acting,"Constantine is your basic man-vs-devil plot, with lots of biblical and mythological history thrown in. Until checking the reviews, I didn't realize this was once a comic book, but when watching the DVD, I definitely got the feeling that the directors had a good time as many crazy shape-shifting and skin-morphing special effects that they could pull off.[...] He delivers everything in his stoner monotone and has no range of emotion. Everyone in the movie, in fact, showed no emotion. No one ever got excited or agitated--they maintained the same calm, steady pace no matter whether they were doing something mundane or trying to save the future of mankind.This plot had a lot of potential, but it seems like the focus was on neat-o special effects and not on decent acting."
3,Interesting patchwork,"I'm a big fan of the graphic novels, so there was minimal disappointment at a few items. Firstly, there were far too many liberties taken w/the source material. Midnite is neutral: Gabriel is actually sympathetic (1st part of movie). There is much borrowing & mixing of elements. It saddens me that they A. Stripped Connie of his cockney accent, B. Relegated Chas (Chandler) to a young, overeager apprentice (I always moan about sidekicks: it seems to be Hollywood's quickie answer), & C. twisted the story around (L.A instead of London, Connie was a suicide, he uses some kind of holy shotgun, that sort of thing). Hollyweird really needs to stick to the original storyline more often. The FX was pretty good, the storyline w/the twin women was fairly original, which is why I'm giving it 3 stars."
4,Constantine,I had seen commercials for the movie Constantine on Tv ad they looked interesting so I rented the movie from my local Blockbuster. Overall I would say the movie was interesting and entertaining. I thought the scenes of Hell looked pretty cool along with those hell-creatures. I also like the gun that Constatine uses. I have never read the comics that this book is based on so I can't really judge the movie on them but I still don't understand why there are so many bad reviews for this movie. It kept me entertained and that is what I want most from a movie even if it isn't 100% loyal to the book or comica that it was based on.
3,** Not Too Bad **,"I enjoyed this movie ... even though Keanu Reeves seems to play the same character in everything he does! Still, this movie was visually interesting and had some good ol' standard Good vs. Evil stuff going on. Not as good as other good vs evil movies I have seen but not too shabby."
3,Cool but lacking.,"There are some cool ideas and action sequences here, but the script doesn't do them justice. You never really feel Constantine is in that much danger, that there's anything he can't handle. Without that, it's just a guy going through the motions. Don't get me wrong, it's a decent movie, just not the movie it could've been. Pity."
4,Constantine,I liked the movie which was based on the comic book Hellblazer. The DVD Special features I enjoyed very much. It gave a more in depth look at the translation from comic to film. I was really impressed as to how the special effects artists were able to create the hell demons. The comic book is very good added bonus.
2,Keanu blows any credibility this movie had with his acting,"Dull, loud and boring adaptation of the classic horror comic book lacks a real leading man for the movie to fly with its bad script and almost as bad special effects. While Keanu fails miserably in his role, his co-star Rachel Weisz does more with hers than the actual movie does, giving her character a sense of dignity and grace despite of the lousy dialog, Badly written characters and insane plot cliches that is surrounding her during the course of the movie. Her performance alone is worth the price of the movie ticket but other than her, there is really no reason rush to see the bad film.My Suggestion? Wait for Dvd."
2,"Cool concept, not so good delivery. 2.5 Stars","I thought the movie was ok and had some cool moments. I didn't like the deamons/devils; they looked terrible. They needed a better artist or vision/concept. The movie had so much potential. Hollywood has not produced a good Heaven/Hell, Angel/Devil movie. Hopefully something of worth will be produced in the near future."
2,This movie was pretty bad,"I've never read Hellblazer before, but I am a comic fan and thought maybe I'd enjoy this movie. I was wrong. This movie had some of the worst acting I've seen, especially by Keanu Reeves and Shia LaBeouf. Aside from that, it contained a storyline that was just too much for a 2 hour movie. It's obvious that Constantine's life is more complicated than can fit in their time slot, so it appears they left many things out and tried to pack in as much action as possible without explaining very much.Overall, the storyline was incredibly boring, and despite some decent special effects, the action was even more yawn-inducing. This is the first movie in my entire life I've ever fallen asleep in."
1,Unholy Crap,"If the Matrix And the Exorcist got together and had a baby and it came out as a turd then that would be this movie. Terrible acting, the worst script this side of Reefer Madness, and an unplausible plot revolving around (sigh) the Devil, a hippy-dressing angel, and a holy artifact found in (What!) Mexico? The only thing realistic about that was how easy it is for illegals to cross the border. Now, everyone put their forearms together and repeat after me: GO INTO THE TOILET, I COMMAND THEE! Now flush."
1,"If Hell wants Keanu Reeves, let it have him and this stupid film.","Dumb, very dumb supernatural thriller that lacks a lot of brains and a credible leading man. Keanu Reeves literally sucks this movie dried with his lack of talent and makes every thing about the movie into a very bad and cruel joke. The director can't even stage a scene with tension and some parts of the movie are very dark to even see what is happening from time to time. The script is horrible with some of the worse dialog imaginable and the special effects are pretty bad. The only thing that this movie has going for it is the performances of Rachel Weisz, who gives the movie more class and dignity that it does not deserve and Peter Stormare, who does more with his small role than Keanu does with his main character.If it were not for Weisz and Stormare, I probably would have walked right out of the theater, that's how bad the rest of the movie was."
1,Don't waste your time watching this trash,"If you're looking for good movies to watch, don't waste your time and money with this one, I mean it's so stupid, boring, bad acting, all the movie is awful that's all what I can tell you"
1,"If You saw this movie, I pity you!","This is a Bad movie from start to finish.Perhaps the trend of tranfering comix books into big screenmovies has begun to play itself out. And its time for Hollywoodto find some fresh material to use.In my estamation this movie was poorly concieved and directed. I've have read one or two of the Hellbound books. They arefairly good. (If your into catholic guilt that is!)But sometimes whats just so so on paper, can be really goodon film. I was hoping this would be so with Constantine.Sadly I was mistaken. Keanue Reeves performance was nothing more that a wise cracking version of his charicter in the Matrix.I have two suggestions.1.Save your money and buy or rent much better movies.Such as the oringinal 60's film ""The Haunting"" with Julie Harrisand Claire Bloom. or ""Rosemarie's Baby"" with Mia Farrell.Or the overlooked mid 70's flick ""The Sentinal"".2.Please Keanue, find yourself some better roles. and get outof the ""Matrix""!"
1,"NO Plot, ALL Special EFFectS, Bad Scripting !","Somethings Just aren't Worth reviewing ...This is one of Them !Run from this feature ! I couldn't even finish watching it and I love Demon movies ! If U thought ""Lost Souls"" was bad it is a revalation compared to this !"
1,"This generations ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" ( Yes, it's that bad.)","What do you get when you have an actor who can't act, a director who can't direct and a script that is so badly written that you will be laughing your head off at the same time you are throwing up at the pure stupidity of it? You get one of the worse movies ever made. Keanu Reeves performance in this film is so bad, it makes his Bill and Ted movies look Oscar worthy. The direction from first time Director Frances Lawrence is flat out horrible with lousy direction and murky cinematography and the script is so badly written that you are really surprise by what you are hearing from the actors' mouths from time to time. Out Of all the actors involved only Rachel Weisz and Peter Stormare are able to come out of this horrible film with their dignity intact with good performances that this film really did not deserved. Other than Weisz and Stormare, almost everybody involved should hang their heads in shame for making such a bad movie."
1,A real stinker.,"Mediocre Matrix rip off with a twist finds poor Keanu Reeves trying to rip off his own series with a supernatural tale that has one bad cliché after the next and doing a really bad job on top of that.. The director barely scrapes by with the bad script that everybody had to work with and the special effects are sub par for a movie of this size. I agree with the majority who wrote that only Rachel Weisz is fine here with a better than this film deserved performance but other than her effort, the movie just is not worth your time.Avoid, it's really that bad."
1,The worse.,"Dull, loud and boring adaptation of the classic horror comic book lacks a real leading man for the movie to fly with its bad script and almost as bad special effects. While Keanu fails miserably in his role, his co-star Rachel Weisz does more for this movie than the movie does for her, giving her character a real sense of grace and strong will despite the lousy dialog, badly written characters and insane plot clichés that is surrounding her during the course of the movie. Weisz's performance alone is worth the price of the movie ticket but other than her, there is really no reason rush to see the bad film.My Suggestion? Wait for DVD."
1,What a letdown.,"Shameful attempt at a hybrid of horror, action and suspends that cast Keanu Reeves as occult detective John Constantine in an adaptation of the vertigo comic book that loses it's edge and goes for the gusto in flat out stupidly with a boring acting turn by Keanu Reeves who just does not come across well in the role. The story just makes no sense at all and feels like it needed a good rewrite for everything to truly come together and the direction just does help move things along. Other than the great scene in which Rachel Weisz get torn out of a building, most of the special effects are not very good and could have been improved during post production. As for the rest of the actors, only Rachel Weisz manages to give a compelling performance despite the bad script in which she had to work with and Peter Stormare does a great five minute walk on as prince of darkness. Nether of them however can save this runaway train that should have been checked before it left the tracks."
2,constantine video dvd,video would not play in either my 3 dvd players so i ordered another video from someone else. the dvd wasn't van helsing. the dvd was constantine and it was fubar. so what is your idea of correcting the bad dvd i received.
5,Great For HD,"I had seen this movie when it was first released and was impressed by the special effects. But with my endless quest to find hd movies (blue ray is taking over) I knew I had to purchase this one. And I am not disappointed. The extra features are easy to operate and the movie looks fantastic,not 3D like blue ray seems to bring out in their dvds. Hd movies are just that, it has outstanding clarity but doesn't give that fakey look that blue ray does."
1,A huge disappointment.,"Bland rip off of a great comic book not only puts the worse actor imaginable for the main character but has a script that is almost a crime in itself. The dialog is so bad that it would even make deaf children cry and the special effects are not as good as one might hope. Some of the acting is great and that's a great feat in itself because of how bad the script is. Rachel Weisz, Djimon Hounsou and Tilda Swinton do great work here and for that, people should be grateful for but it's still Keanu's film and he still torpedo it with a lousy performance that is in tune with the lousy script it has.If this is the best they have to offer for the fans of the comic book, then take it back."
1,Please...,Terrible Keanu Reeves supernatural epic that even makes the last two matrix films look like masterpieces compared to it. Keanu does give the worse performance of his career with this turkey and the film itself is almost as bad as his performance with sloppy dialog and lackluster special effects. Rachel Weisz literally gives the only good performance in the entire movie and that's really because she is the only professional actor in it. The rest of the cast is made up of no name actors who make Keanu look like a genius in the acting profession.See it if you are desperate for entertainment or can't get a date.
1,Rather be in hell than to sit though this again.,"Super dumb Keanu Reeves horror film lacks the mind bending fun of the matrix movies and has instead a lackluster core that makes this film as hollow as a helium balloon. Keanu gives a very tired and unsparing performance that does drag the movie down most of the time and the script lacks a voice. The second half of the film manages to go against what the first half establishes and the last thirty minutes absolutely makes no sense what so ever because it has a certain revelation that makes no sense what so ever and leave you wondering on what the hell just happen. The rest of the cast is solid with great performances by Rachel Weisz, Djimon Hounsou and Peter Stormare which the film does not expand on and the script does not give more time to because it only wants to focus its energies on Keanu's bad attitude than the real actors that are in the film.What a shame."
1,Hellboy was a masterpiece compared to this,"Dimwitted supernatural thriller that is a major bore for the most partwith a dimwitted performance by Keanu Reeves, who is miscast in themain role and a screenplay that is as stupid as it can be. A lot hasbeen said about Rachel Weisz being the only good thing that this moviehas to offer and I will agree with that assessment because she doesmake you care about what is going on with the movie while you aretrying to figure out a way to care about the dumb story that is beingtold. Weisz's performance is much too rich and powerful for a movielike this and she gives you a reason to stick around while in essencethere is no reason to even stay till the end. Hellboy was a masterpiececompared to this and that was marginal decent for what it was at thevery best.For Weisz's rich and powerful performance, I give the movie one star.If she were not in the movie, my rating would be in the negative numbers"
3,Where's the captions???,"I think I would have enjoyed this movie a bunch more if a.) the sound had been better or b:) there had been closed captions. I am admittedly a bit hard of hearing and wear a hearing device, but the music and background sounds were extremely loud and the dialogue was unintelligible. I can get captions thru netflix on my ROKU; why not here on Amazon?That said, I enjoyed the storyline and action... It's one of those cult, fun things."
2,"Blame the director for this mess, not Keanu.","This is the fault of the person in charge, not Keanu Reeves. The movie from day one was plague with problems concerning the people behind the scenes, who wanted to make kids film and the director, who really did not know what he was doing. Keanu tried is best with a script that was being change almost every day and I think he did well. I will admit that this is not his best performance and I would also agree with the majority of the reviews written that Rachel Weisz gave the best performance in the entire movie (she is that good). If you want to put fault somewhere, put it on the producers and the director, they were the ones who messed up the movie for their own gain. Keanu did his best with what he had and he really did not have much thanks to the people in charge."
5,Good Movie,"I get the impression that some fans of the Hellblazer books did like approve of this film. I liked the film. It was one of of the few 2005 films that I did like. My advice for the Hellblazer fans is : if you don't like the film, then don't buy the DVD. Otherwise grow up and stop whining."
4,Solid story and plenty of action,"I have to caveat this review by saying that I wasn't familiar with the comic or graphic novels of this character. That said, I really enjoyed the movie and felt that it blended historical and mythological themes regarding heaven and hell well. The beginning when the primary relic that the film focuses on is found was particularly weak, however all of the characters had at least a few good moments with most of them being recognizable without being cliches.Keanu Reeves has more of an edge in playing John Constantine than in most of his previous efforts, but you'll still find yourself waiting for him to call for George Carlin pick him up in his transdimensional telephone booth ala ""Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure"""
3,Supernatural Film Noir,"I enjoyed the special effects and they were interesting. I don't think any one understands Catholic theology anymore, especially the priests. The movie spouted theology, angelology and eschatolgy, but it doesn't really match anything I know. The plot was hard to follow and had some hard to understand plot lines, but it made some pleasantly surprising turns too. The whole ""spear of destiny"" idea was very confusing. The characters were very interesting. At the start, I thought Keanu miscast, but he grew on me. I enjoyed the point the Reeves's character made about believing in the devil. The heroine says, ""I don't believe in the devil."" Keanu replies, ""That's too bad. He's believes in you."" The truth is the truth no matter what you believe. It doesn't prove God or satan exists, but it is something to think about.It was fun for a spirtual thriller."
3,Fun waste of time,"There are movies that you want to sit down and spend your time absorbing, and there are movies that you want to watch with your brain set on cruise control. The latter applies to this film. Keanu Reeves is considered by many to play one role well, and that is of Keanu Reeves. Throw in some religious overtones, gun play, and supernatural forces to get Constantine. I've never read the comic book or checked up on the canon storyline but I can only give the film 3/5 stars. It is enjoyable but not something I'd *must* watch."
4,HD DVD Review...,"I really liked this movie and the style/look of it. I don't read comic books or graffic novels but love movies and I really liked this film. I can't speak from an adaptation point of view.As for the HD side of things. Absolutely, one of the best discs I've seen to date out of about 20+. It is virtually flawless even in darker scenes and the entire movie is sharp (but not overly sharp-edge enhanced)and the colors are really nice. Lots of scenes that I now notice more of stuff in the backgrounds at 56"" HD. The DD+ soundtrack is great and I'm sure the DDTrue is amazing eventhough most of us can't decode it yet. It has tons of extra material that I don't care about myself, but it's there.Perfect video transfer- I love HD. Give it a shot if you're choosing your free HD DVD's from promotion. BTW- it took a good 2 months to get mine, but don't give up."
2,Not Much Worthwhile Here,"Constantine was a big disappointment to me. Unlike many other reviewers, I had never seen this in print. Reeves does a fair job in his role, but Rachel Weisz fails to deliver here. Her character is unconvincing and ""wooden"". The story is a remix of story lines from other stories, and it fails to bring much that is fresh to the screen. The theology is strange, Satan looks like a retired guy from Florida, and the ""balance between good and evil"" rule seems contrived.The story was not compelling. I almost turned it off out of boredom."
4,about the movie Constantine.......,"this film is basically about how Keanu Reeves (Human world) fought against the hell creatures. The story here is to mention how he save the lady police officer from death after the lady police officer needs his help to find out why her sister kill herself so strangely as she suspect that her sister somehow is being controlled by certain things in hell to end her life short. What happen, in the ned, to Keanu Reeve(constantine) and the lady police officer? Visit your nearest theatre now for those whom are interested.N/B: There are many moments of shocks in the movie during the fight between Human life and hell creatures where these creatures appeared suddenly....forwarned especially to the weak heart people out there.N/B2: What I could refer to this story is something like fighting between the good and bad like western against terrorist."
2,If you're in the mood for some blaspheming...,"Let me be frank... half-breeds? Come on... What the heck was that about...? Overall, this movie was blasphemous, graphic, funny at some parts, interesting, and... Catholic.The major upsides were the fact it had some pretty good ""cool guy"" lines every now and then as well as some pretty good visuals, but there were, of course, the downsides of blasphemy, confusing things like ""half-breeds"" that I don't recall having any place in even the stories of demons (much less the harbored beliefs), and a few other things... Props on the cool sounding title though."
4,The dark one cometh.,"Satan is our brother, he will come again. This movie shows how close we are to deliverance. It was an ample chronicle of what could be. The dead are rising now, and soon all will be a river of blood and fire. All vampires should study this film."
3,Not Bad,Constantine is not a bad movie at all.When I saw the trailer for it i knew I had to see it.I had very high expectations for it.I just rented it last week and was not dissapointed but in a way I was.I thought it was going to be a little better than it turned out but it still isn't a bad movie.Don't pay alot of money for it but it is worth seeing.I give it 3 stars
1,AWFUL.....................,My goodness. I rented this movie expecting a scary thriller and it almost put me to sleep. This is Keanu Reeves' Sorriest performance to date...... not that he has had many good ones. His acting was horrible in this movie and the whole movie did not make sense and was just plain Boring to watch. I was very disappointed for this film is just plain awful!!!!!!!
1,Received wrong product,"I ordered Constantine and got another DVD instead. I shipped back Constantine at shippers request. Haven't received Constantine yet. Please credit my credit card as it's been to long. I no longer want the DVD.Thanks, Al Pins"
1,"Keanu Reeves, need I say more?","Has there ever been a movie with Keanu Reeves in it that had any merit to it? He is one of the worst actors on the screen today. Whenever I see that he is in a film, I know I'm going to be in for a bad time. Despite that truth, I dared to risk it once again and rented this movie. I wasn't disappointed. Save your money folks. Keanu reached his peak in Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. It's been downhill ever since."
3,JUST THE SPECIAL EFFECTS,I really don't like this movie but I think the special effects were pretty good. It's just another Matrix film with some demons and Keanu Reeves saving the day in a world that you just have to understand to watch the entire movie. So I agree with some others reviews that only Rachel Weiz and the special effects are worth to pay for.
1,Dumb and pretty bad.,"What do you get when you have an actor who can't act, a director who can't direct and a script that is so badly written that you will be laughing your head off at the same time you are throwing up at the pure stupidity of it? You get one of the worse movies ever made. Keanu Reeves performance in this film is so bad, it makes his Bill and Ted movies look Oscar worthy. The direction from first time Director Frances Lawrence is flat out horrible with lousy direction and murky cinematography and the script is so badly written that you are really surprise by what you are hearing from the actors' mouths from time to time. Of all the actors involved only Rachel Weisz and are able to come out of this horrible film with their dignity intact with good performance that this movie really did not deserved. Other than them, almost everybody involved should hang their heads in shame for making such a bad movie."
1,Pure stupidly,"Horrible and down right stupid Keanu Reeves action/horror movie not only makes the people who pay to see it look stupid but it solidify him as one of the worse actors of our generation with a horrible performance that makes everything about this film into a joke. I feel sorry for his fellow actors which Includes Rachel Weisz, (who give the movie's only real performance) for even being on the same screen with him because despite their good work and effort, he manages to make the movie into a real choir to watch.The word of mouth is justified for this piece of garbage."
1,"Really, Really BAD.","Horrible Keanu Reeves action film that is as bad as the word of mouth suggests and then some. Keanu's acting is so bad in this film that he even makes the dumb script with the horrible dialog look good in comparison to his performance. Rachel Weisz does give a great and lively performance but she's the only actor in the film who bothers to give one while the rest of the actors camp it up to the point of nausea (with the exception of Peter Stormare, who was great as the devil) The direction is a joke and lacks coherency plus the screenplay does not handle the subject very well at all with dialog that is horrendous and story structure that literally makes no sense.Thumbs up to Rachel Weisz and of Peter Stormare for at least doing their best with what was handed to them but the movie itself was horrible."
1,Pretty bad,"Very bad Keanu Reeves film that could be one of the worse films ever made. Keanu sinks it up so badly that he should be thrown out of Hollywood all together and they should include the director and the screenwriters as well because the movie is as bad as Keanu's performance. Out of the entire cast only Rachel Weisz gives a real performance in this movie and she is so good in fact that she does almost redeems the entire film but not even her great talent could save it from the script, which is excruciatingly bad and the direction, which is as bad as the script and lacks focus for what its trying to accomplish. The story makes no sense and manages to go against itself in certain scenes and the climax literally destroys the narrative that the movie was trying to build up.Maybe asking for a competed director and a lead actor who can act was a tall order for the producers of this film."
1,absolutely awful,"This is easily one of the worst movies I have seen in years. A barely comprehensible mess, with no redeeming qualities."
3,Better without Neo,"I think it's probably safe to say (now that the Matrix trilogy is over) that Keanu Reeves is simply one of the most overrated actors ever. All he does is sit around acting exactly like he did in Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure (no joke one of top ten worst movies of all time). Rachel Weisz is actually surprisingly good in this movie and would have been better if she didn't have such a terrible co-worker but i guess there's nothing anyone can do about that so we'll move on to the plot. Good, overall. Some things were fairly lacking though, and also some were completely unnecessary (stuff that happens in the end i don't want to give away in this review). Overall, would be 4 stars but Keanu definitely knocks it down a bar."
1,Flimsy and incoherent.,"Incoherent thriller that has Keanu Reeves in full matrix mold and making a complete fool out of himself with a pretty bad script. His performance is not very good and he's miscast for the role he is in. The other actors in the film, most noticeable Rachel Weisz ( She does give the best performance in this movie, she is that good), Djimon Hounsou and Tilda Swinton all do better than poor Keanu in there roles and manages to rise above some of the cliches and the flimsy plot to give solid performances but not even they can get pass the fact of how badly this film was made and how incoherent it really is. For their performance alone, the movie gets a star from me but don't expect much from the movie itself."
4,"Typical Keanu, not so typical Constantine","This movie has almost no chance to make anybody happy. Constantine graphic novel fans will be disappointed because the character is changed and quite different from the books. Keanu fans won't see Neo (except for some time when Constantine was indecisive) and there aren't super kung fu fight sceens.That said, it's a slow moving, laid-back plot with a lot of back story which takes a bit to figure out. Rachel Weisz is very good but her character isn't developed as completely as it should have been. Keanu plays it very laconic (which, after all, is his strength) and it mostly works. But I think he should have been a bit more animated and I would have been interested in some sparks between him and Rachel.All in all, this is actually a pretty interesting movie, part The End of Days and part The Omen. I did enjoy it and I'm likely to get the dvd. Give it a rent, it's definitely worth a look."
2,Just a waste of time,Lightweight horror yarn that is more fluff than substance. Keanu Reeves was not the right man to pull this role off and the decision to cast him was huge disservice to the entire movie because he just does not cut it in the role. He makes an effort but he just not a strong enough actor to pull of the role and the script he's working with does not cut it as well because its badly written in certain scenes and does not hold itself well once you look closely at it. The visual effects are below par with some of the movie that has come out recently and the musical score is not well done. Rachel Weisz does in fact give the best performance out of the entire film and that's manly because she gives more to her role than the story itself does and a special nod also goes to Peter Stormare who's only in the last few minutes of the film but manages to give a good performance with the little he has.
2,"LIKED THE MOVIE,BUT IS NOT DTS SOUND!!!","I cant believe these movies on double disk put all the loaded stuffs on disk ,And hard work, which most people don't care, then they put 5.1 audio sound crap to it, such as awful...please people if u do all the goodies an all on DVDS at least put the DTS sound to it for most people like me have surround sound these days at home..Such movies like this kind of gender u should have a blast high-end sound to it to really enjoy the movie such as DTS ...for this important matter I give 2 starts and I am not going to buy this DVD."
1,most boring thriller ever written,"I really wish I had gone to the movies to watch this instead of buying, that way I could have walked out instead of feeling compelled to watch the whole thing to get my monies worth. The plot is fine but the acting is so stilted and the pace of the story so slow that I would prefer to watch paint dry. If a rating of -3 stars was available that would be my rank for this movie."
1,Constantine: Great effects but no power,"The special effects were great; however, the plot was slow moving. I was bored with the story line. John Constantine running around using crosses and other religious items was not believable because he didn't believe in God. He cherishes and has faith in created religious objects but has no faith in God. This is equivalent to making a movie about Spiderman but not having him get bitten by the spider, or making about about Luke Skywalker without him using the force. Constantine's holy incantations seemed like a bunch of voodoo mumbo jumbo. Anyone who knows anything about the bible should know that if you are going to make a fictional work off of it, at least get the core principles down. What was good about the movie is the fact that it showed that you don't have to work your way into heaven. It showed that although you may have a lot of faults, God will accept you where you are in life. All you have to do is accept Him."
1,Much worse than I expected.,Mind bending stupid horror film that lacks any form of common sense what so ever with a script that was looked like it was written by a ten year old with dialog only a child could understand and a leading man who is as bad an actor as they come. [...] The special effects are not really good and the direction seems forced in some places. The only performance of merit that this film has is from Rachel Weisz who does much more with her character than she needed to and she does lift this film pass much of it's problems but a good actor can do only do so much with out the help of the director or the rest of the cast and she's basically by herself in this film in terms of good acting.Avoid.
2,"What the ""hell"" is going on here???","This is a bizare movie. I was raised Catholic and it made no sense on either the theological or fantasy level. God love ya' Keanu, but damn, find some range bro. Very boring lead acting. Lines like ""I just got attacted by a demon"" performed like he was asking the time of day.Why was everybody whispering? I can't hear you!! I haven't heard this much whipering since ""The Sixth Sense"".I did like this the first time when it was called ""The Prophecy"".Enough bagging. It did have awesome FX and the guy who played Lucifer was great!!This could have been a four star movie, but alas, it was mostly a mind-draining snooze fest. Sorry Keanu. The Matrix 1-3 still rule!2 1/2 stars to be fair."
4,"A lot of fun, but don't take seriously","Constantine is great fun, very light - don't take it seriously or you'll regret it. I love the main characters - Gabriel, Constantine, the Fixer with the fetish for bugs. The lead woman was a bit flat, and constantine wasn't as colourful as in the comic... partly due to Keanu's limited acting range (ie ""woah!"") but also because he was adapted for US audiences.There are even serious plot issues... why exactly is the fabulous christian artefact... owned by the Nazis... to be found in Mexico?But even despite its deficiencies, it's still a lot of fun - packed with great action, powerful scenes and a wonderful moody feel. Even the cheesy shots seem to work - eg Satan gloating over Constantine's imminent death, then receiving a finger for his trouble. and what a fantastic choice of casting that was ;)Watch it, but don't think too deeply about it - it's for fun, not study."
3,"Not Awful, Not Great, A Lot Like Purgatory I Suppose","This movie is better than some of the other recent comic book adaptations that bog down our theaters anymore. This is definatly not as crappy as say, Catwoman, Elektra, the lackluster HellBoy, League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, The Hulk, Daredevil, Spawn, and is also better than the two Matrix sequels. That being said that really doesn't mean much though because that is a pretty crappy list. Keanu Reeves does well as the title character and the supporting cast is really good as well, but this film is strictly for genre fans. Some good effects make up for the silly theological mish mash."
1,What a slap in the face to the fans of the comic book.,"Lousy and disrespectful adaptation of the Comic Book Hellblazer is a travesty of a high order. Who ever thought that Keanu Reeve would have been perfect as John Constantine should be fired for sheer in competence. Keanu takes a great role and basically craps on it with his lousy acting. Of all the actors involve, only Rachel Weisz and Peter Stormare are able to transcend the horrible script, which manages to contradict itself in the last forty-five minutes of the movie, and the climax is a horrible joke in itself. The special effects were decent but I have seen better on TV plus the plot is taken from an episode of Buffy the Vampire slayer. They should have just called it Keanu The vampire slayer instead."
1,Dumb and unsatisfying.,"Dumb and unsatisfying horror movie that is made worse by the terrible acting of Keanu Reeves, who is extremely miscast in his role. The rest of the film is almost as bad as Reeves's performance with the exception of Rachel Weisz, who manages to give a great performance thou out despite the movie horrible script and crappy special effects. I would have paid to see her character in a more serious and better horror film than the garbage that is here.The one star review is for Weisz, for at least giving a great performance despite the huge shortcomings of this film. Too bad that she was not the lead instead of Keanu Reeves."
1,Pretty Bad.,"Very bad Keanu Reeves film that could be one of the worse films ever made. Keanu sinks it up so badly that he should be thrown out of Hollywood all together and they should include the director and the screenwriters as well because the movie is as bad as Keanu's performance. Out of the entire cast only Rachel Weisz gives a real performance in this movie and she is so good in fact that she does almost redeems the entire film but not even her great talent could save it from the script, which is excruciatingly bad and the direction, which is as bad as the script and lacks focus for what its trying to accomplish. The story makes no sense and manages to go against itself in certain scenes and the climax literally destroys the narrative that the movie was trying to build up.Maybe asking for a competed director and a lead actor who can act was a tall order for the producers of this film."
1,Unwatchable,"Bad special effects movie that has possibly the worse performance ever by Keanu Reeves, who almost makes the movie as bad as his performance. I don't know why Keanu was cast in this role but he's the worse actor in the entire movie and Shia LaBeouf is almost as bad as he is and gives a very annoying performance that reeks of stupidity. Only Rachel Weisz and Peter Stormare are able to give good performance in this bad movie and for that, I will not totally thrash this movie but its still not very good and you should wait for cable."
1,Horrible,I'm a fan of Rachel Weisz but not even her effort could have saved this extreamly bad film. Keanu Reeves should be put in jail for his horrible performance and the director should never direct again for his lack of directional skills.Avoiud like the pluge.
2,What was this story about?,"Yes there were some good effects and wild looking creatures, some decent ideas, a handful of good acting, but where the hell was the story? How many times can you kill yourself and go to hell to see the same thing over and over. It was less irritating when the same thing was done in little nicky. Reeve's acting is normally garbage but he gets put in some good movies like the replacements. This time it was his bad acting paired with an awful movie. You need a good ending."
4,Great Visuals and some scenes will stay with you.,"I guess I'll begin with an admission. I moderately enjoyed the film when I first saw it even though I went to see it with someone who really didn't like it. But then a strange thing happened. Usually after I see a ""worthless"" film, I forget it within a week. However this did not happen with Constantine. I found myself thinking of some of the scenes even weeks after seeing the film. So it is a film that has stuck with me, and that indicates it has something special. I gather from the reviews that it appears to be a love it or leave it movie. I would be interested if the movie has ""stayed with"" any of the ""leave it"" group. For me, however, I have slowly fallen in the ""love it"" category, and I'm looking forward to the DVD."
1,"Other than the great performances of Rachel Weisz and Peter Stormare, the movie is horrible.",Very bad Keanu Reeves horror film is a real look at how much a vanity project can spiral out of control. Keanu Reeves is just out of place in supernatural tale about a private eye that helps a cop look into the suicide of her twin sister. The special effects are not of top quality and the script is too jumbled to even try to figure out what is going on from time to time. The rest of the acting is decent with Rachel Weisz stealing the show and giving this movie more than her fair share of heart and talent and Peter Stormare doing more in his brief cameo that most of the other actors in the film. Unfortunately nether Weisz or Stormare can over come the hack like script which treats their characters and the story of the film as a joke. I like a good popcorn film but this is not one of them.
1,Poor and rather too lowbrow for it's own good.,"Lowbrow and pretty stupid horror movie that lacks screenplay to not only explains what is going on but a lead actor who can act. Keanu Reeves is the gapping hole that sinks this ship and his performance will be remembered as one of the worse performances ever in a major motion picture. It also does not help the film that the director does not know how to shot a scene and the special effects are bottom of the barrel for a movie of this kind. Rachel Weisz is great but she's the only actor who seems like she gives a damn about her performance While the rest seem like they are sleepwalking.If you love to look at your watch for two hours waiting for this movie to end, be my guess. If you want to save your dignity and your eyes, skip this film."
1,Boring,"Constantine is a horrible movie. The first hour of it is just unexplained occurrences. In a movie, it is good for things to be unexplained at the beginning and gradually explain themselves as the movie goes on, but when it goes on for an hour, you get bored and stop caring about the characters. Then when this happens you can't tell when the movie starts to pick up. Then, no matter what happens in the movie you don't care and it becomes a long boring escapade. None of the characters interested me because I didn't think any of them were well done and as I said before, it needs to explain some stuff earlier in the movie and when that doesn't happen the more unexplained events that go on just add on to those before, so you stop trying to keep track of it all and that's when I stopped caring. It would be a form of torture if someone made me sit through this movie again."
1,"This generations ""Plan 9 from Outer Space""","What do you get when you have an actor who can't act, a director who can't direct and a script that is so badly written that you will be laughing your head off at the same time you are throwing up at the pure stupidity of it? You get one of the worse movies ever made. Keanu Reeves performance in this film is so bad, it makes his Bill and Ted movies look Oscar worthy. The direction from first time Director Frances Lawrence is flat out horrible with lousy direction and murky cinematography and the script is so badly written that you are really surprise by what you are hearing from the actors' mouths from time to time. Of all the actors involved only Rachel Weisz and Djimon Hounsou are able to come out of this horrible film with their dignity intact with good performance that this movie really did not deserved. Other than them, almost everybody involved should hang their heads in shame for making such a bad movie."
4,Great urban fantasy,"My husband wanted this for Christmas and he loved it. Ten more words are required so here they are. Take that, tips and guidelines robot!"
3,Peaks Early - Then Fizzles Out Toward the End,"Constantine is a somewhat entertaining movie. Not great, but OK. The first half of this movie was very good, but the film seemed to run out of steam... The ending does have one great scene involving the devil, and I would recommend this for movie for ""light entertainment"" - especially if you are a Keanu Reeves fan."
4,"Scratched discs, but OK","Both disks were severely scratched upon receipt, but I've played both discs and not skips or problems. Would've rated 5 stars if discs were not scratched. Movie and extras are great!"
5,one of my favorites,"First of all, I haven't read the comics at all, so I don't know how it matches up to those. Nonetheless, this is one of my favorite movies.It has action, drama, even a little romance plus great characters (acted well, too) and some far-out cultish creatures, symbols, and history. It's just one of those movies that is so in-depth you can really see this other world the author (of the comic) and directors have created.Definietly worth watching again and again. As for the extras, the second disk is very good, especially the part on ""Constantine Cosmology"" (I enjoyed because Constantine is related to the Hero Cycle of Joseph Campbell, if you are familiar as I am in my learning of mythology). The comic is just the first one, and not the entire series, and interesting to see."
5,Additional Info,Didn't see this listed but if you put the supplimental disc in an X-box you can play the Constantine video game.
4,You have got to be kidding me!,"You have got to be kidding me with the earlier reviews. this movie was very good. It's not Oscar winning but entertaining to say the least. This movie provides interesting storyline and great special effects. I don't really think it was set out to be some ""exorcist"" type horror film. Whatever you do watch it. It's more than worth it."
2,Just not ... Harold,"I have to agree with the other reviewers--these newer, more colorful Harold books... miss the point entirely. In this book, Harold and his crayon dont seem to have much to do with the world around him; the story is disjointed; the prose is wooden... Where's Harold's ingenuity? (ok, ONE instance of 'drawing/thinking on his feet) Where are the accidental strokes that he turns into strokes of genius?Harold and the Purple Crayon was the first book I ever checked out of the library and it was magical... and, by extension, made the library seem a magical place of infinite possibility--like my own purple crayon. The simple line drawings with just that purple crayon prove to our little ones (and us!) that imagination is the only tool you need for magic... Conversely, these slick multicolored books have no magic."
5,"Excellent analysis of Bateson, Recursion and Ecology","Ecological understanding is a must for all generations. For those with the courage to think through the implications of an ecological world view and want to learn the scientific concepts which help facilitate greater understanding of natural systems, leading to (hopefully) better decisions regarding resource use, this is a great book. By tackling recursion and non-linear causation at multiple time scales and cognitive levels, Harrie-Jones helps enrich the recuriveness of population level learning. Bateson was, NO DOUBT, one of the most challenging thinkers of his generation. Struggling at all times to keep his focus on how to make nature and communication more intelligible to more people so that they would have the tools and wisdom to see the consequences of their action on both other people and the planet. Rigorous and enchanting cognitive medicine for all those working to make a better world."
5,Spey Flyes,"A wonderful history of the major patterns. Colour plates with most of the patterns as well. If you want to fish the traditional spey, this si a book to have!!"
1,Be careful,"I bought this tire for asphalt and cement roads, like it's name [ city ride ], but after using them for some monthsI noticed that if you have them with too much pressure the on bumps the bike can hit pretty hard and you can lose the control if you are not prepared; better to use low pressure.But the most problematic situation is the grip. I got into an emergency brake, a car show up in front of me, the driver was distracted, then the tire was completely stopped but slipping because it has zero grip because the center part which that is smooth is too wide.I am planning to create some groove to them just to using some more time.If you want your life don't buy this tire. I trust Continental but this was a failure. I can't imagine this tire in rainy conditions."
3,Good Tire but Sizing is Misleading,"After riding on a set of Continental Cityride tires virtually puncture-free, I've just purchased a second set (although finding them at a deep discount had a lot to do with this decision). PROS: Durable, affordable, rolls nicely on pavement, easy to install and remove. CONS: Heavy, but that's expected for a steel bead, puncture-protected tire at this price point. My main complaint is these tires are not true to size. I observed this on my last set of Cityrides. They were marketed as 700x32, but I measured them at 29mm in width (inflated to 80psi on Alex DA16 rims). On my second purchase, I wanted to go wider, so I ordered a set in size 700x37. After mounting them on the DA16's and inflating to the max 70psi, I was disappointed to discover that they only measure 32mm in width, a full 5mm narrower than advertised."
2,Lack of evidence appears the hallmark of this work.,"Though this work excellently represents the history of a madman, it is missing the necessary evidentiary links which tie in the suspect to the facts. There is nothing which, in a compelling way, brings the suspect even close to the victims and the evidence which is well documented. It was an enjoyable read nontheless."
3,Do you enjoy speculation?,"While author James Tully presents a rational and logical argument for James Kelly as Jack the Ripper, most of Tully's arguments are based on circumstancial evidence, inductive reasoning, and details which easily could be merely coincidental. That's not to say the arguments fail to persuade -- in fact, Tully presents a great deal to consider. However, for this story to gain acceptance as the definitive solution, a great many more unanswered questions and possible alternative explanations would need resolved. It's food for thought he's trying to construct as a full explanatory meal. I'd recommend borrowing it from the library before buying it, if you are considering adding it to your collection."
3,i bought this guitar,i bought this guitar and its a double cut-away in this nice post 60's ad. name red with a pretty white pick guard and its brimming with sound.it really is sweet . agreat alternative to an s-g or l.p. or strat....especially if you already some name game axes in your arsenal...if you are more budget consciousgo after this kind of guitar....after playing it for just a few minutes you'll be singing its praises.
5,Pleased With Dealer,This was a book for my husband who specializes in literature related to the topic. An out-of-print book and the dealer described condition accurately.
5,Great for Manifestation,"If you have a Jewish/Christian path and are looking for a guide to manifesting things in your life, this is a powerful, but simple method. I experienced almost immediate results through the Psalms. If you find the Wicca and Pagan methods of manifestation too complicated or contrary to your beliefs, I highly recommend this book."
4,Simple yet Powerful.,"I agree with other reviewers who liked this book, by far one of the best buys I made at the time, it is very powerful when used correctly and you'll see results very quickly if not right away, not to be taken lightly though, this is a serious book ! recommended"
1,Don't be decieved,"Don't be decieved with this candle burning book. This is not traditional candle burning, it's new age nonsense. Theres one simple test you can use to determine wether a book is reliable. The author has chosen to use the ""k"" spelling of magic making it magick. This ""K"" spelling was invented by aliester crowley, a drug adict and mental case. It has nothing to do with candle burning with the psalms. This book is new age rubbish and should not be considered authentic or practical. Don't let anyone fool you into thinking magic should be spelled with a k."
1,WASTE WASTE WASTE,All I reall have to say is this book is a complete waste of time and money. DONT BOTHER!
2,Way too much work for gum!,All I need to say about this item is buy gum at the store. way to much work and kneading of gum that tastes like you are chewing on plastic and rubber. Much cheaper too!!!!
3,Bubble Gum Fun x 75 Girl Scouts,The gum kit was pretty easily understood directions-wise. The corn syrup was mostly crystalized but was tossed out in favor of new corn syrup. The wrappers confused me a bit as there were only FIVE wrappers per batch it could make?!? That was a bit weird.This kit was a lot of fun for the girl scouts although more messy than expected. I recommend it for ages 12+
4,Mystery in the Cave,"While exploring Dragon's Mouth Cavern, the Boxcar children encounter a group of suspicious, unfriendly people, including a man who refuses to identify himself, Mr. Pitt and Mr. Lyme who try to scare the young sleuths away, and Crystal Hollowell, who lies about where she works.Can the Boxcar Children solve this underground mystery?"
4,Prepublication endorsement,"The Cannibal's Wife is a searing, self-revealing, and frightening book. On a personal level, it is about sadomasochism, gender asymmetry, and abuse of power. On a social level, it is about institutional blindness and complicity. It is ironic that the church may be one of the last locations in which sexual harassment can be practiced without serious repercussion. It is a riveting read.--Margaret R. Miles Dean and Vice President for Academic Affairs The Graduate Theological Union, Berkeley, CA"
3,rare item codes,"This is a great toy, also in the poogle racing game on level three, it is not impossible to win (some other person said it was) you just have to press... nah I'm not going to tell. figure it out yourself. I myself have a krawk. I've earned the rare item code from the games but neopets could really make sure they put in a correct code. I tried entering mine but the warehouse keeper said ""sorry this neopet does not belong to you"". Basicly this means this code is WRONG. So if your code works (from the game, not from the card) your really lucky. Don't be surprised if it doesn't though.oh yeah, I tell you the secret for the L.3 racing. When it counts down 3.2.1 Then it will say ""Go!"" you can't move know but start pressing the buttons now. REALLY fast . try to stay somewhere in the lead because if two of the players pass you... well... it IS practicly impossible."
1,Stopped working within a month,"My 6 year old daughter enjoyed the toy and loved taking care of it, but after less than a month the toy stopped working. It wasn't a matter of the batteries; it simply ceased functioning. It was quite distressing for my daughter, as she had spent so much time building up the her pet's health, intelligence, happiness, neopoints, and trophies, and they were all lost forever. Because she had put so much time into it and personalized it, she felt like her pet died, and it was a loss."
5,More fun than a real pet!,"As a NeoAddict myself, I have spent many hours at neopets.com . Now with this toy, I can take a Yellow Aisha everywhere! It was so much fun playing games to collect neopoints (Neopian currency) then buying food, toys, and etc. Your pet sleeps at certain hours and eats 3 meals per day (you can adjust the time easily). You also have to moniter your pet's happiness, strength, and hunger, because if you don't take care of your pet, it might leave you! I loved this toy and to me it was better than a pet! (The Aisha Pocket Neopet is also available in blue)"
4,A fun and additive game,"These games are really fun. They are ideal if your mom and dad say no after all that begging for a new dog. These games include shops, mini games, and others. The mini games are Poogle Racing, Techno Says, Bag Drop, and Scorchy Slots. Neopets have taken the world by storm and I think you should be 1 of the millions of people to join them."
3,Good future...,"The Matches is the kind of band everyone should watch, not only do I think they will become a huge sensation in the next few years, I think their material will be looked at closer. This is one of those reviews.The Matches first album, E. Von Dahl Killed The Locals (title comes from the man who made them change their name from The Locals to The Matches), is a modest pop-punk album. It's lyrics are well written and well sung, if not very deep. The album is the self-biography of the band, and mixed in there are the required girlfriend (or lack therefor of) complaints and social this-has-to-be-the-end-of-my-life ideas and dramas of an 18 year old.While a great first time effort, the main problem is that E. Von Dahl lacks any variety or musical depth that other major bands produce. I'd recomend this album to many people, but I can't see this being their best work."
3,Keep an eye on these guys,"The Matches aren't exactly my favorite sound, but the song Chain me Free is absolutely amazing. I definately think these guys have a good start and will get even better with time."
5,Finally Some Good Music,"I've had this CD sitting on my shelf for months because I bought it after hearing Sick Little Suicide on a sampler. Just returned from Warped Tour and heard The Matches live. They were one of the best bands there. Beat out Fall Out Boy, All American Rejects, and the rest. When I got back I put this in my car and I've had it there since. Do youself a favor and if you like some of the new punk, get this. The band has some real talent is not just following a trend."
2,Bad... But they do have potential,There are a couple good songs on this album. But the rest of it is just really bad. But you can just tell by the songs Chain Me Free and Sick Little Suicide they do have potential. Hopefully theyre next cd will be better then this one.
4,Dope CD...takes a while to get used to,"I heard these guys broke up last year. IF that's true, it's a pity. This CD really impressed me, as it journeyed between Trance, House, and just straight up Pop.i'd recommend it."
3,"great eurohouse cd, but if you like trance...listen up","grab it if youre a scooter fan, if you like trance and rave get your hands on his earlier albums like "" and the beat goes on..."" ""and our happy hardcore"", you will also enjoy ""age of love"" and ""rough tough and dangerous"" but without a doubt you will flip through some of the songs. The first two are a must have, its non-stop trance. both are outstanding cds"
3,Hit and Miss,"When I first got this tape, every song on disc 1 played beautifully until the end of #17. #18 only played half way through. The next time I played disc 1, it stopped on #17. The third time I played it, it played all the way through. I have mixed emotions about this disc. However, I did enjoy the music and singing."
1,Delivery time too slow,"From the time of order to receipt, the book took longer than any vendor I've ordered from previously. There were no courtesy notification of when the item was sent to gauge the time of delivery. The condition of the book was as promised. Overall, I wouldn't order from the same vendor again."
3,average,"A few of the stories were very good, and a few weren't very good at all, but most were just average. The average stories were just too predictable. Usually they ended with someone turning into a gargoyle, or there was a gargoyle protector killing people, things like that. I was really excited about finding this anthology, because I recognized a lot of authors I liked in it: Neil Gaiman, Katherine Kurtz, Jane Yolen, Jo Clayton, Charles de Lint. Unfortunately, most of the stories weren't nearly as good or as original as I had thought they'd be. I enjoyed Charles de Lint's ""May This Be Your Last Sorrow"" the most, but the rest was really just so-so."
1,Yet Another Lousy Crowes Album,Boned-out pot boys desperate to regroup and recoup a fanbase.This pretty much confirms it. The Black Crowes are washed up.
3,"new band members, but same old sound","despite getting 2 new band members the robinson brothers, still managed to keep that old B.C. sound. sort of sounds like shake your money maker. got to have it if your a true fan."
2,"Great Band, Poor Effort.","I love the Crowes -- best band of the '90's. However, I'm still riding the euphoria of ""Southern Harmony"" and ""Amorica"". ""By Your Side"" is so trite. The lyrics are sometimes ""goofy"", and mostly simplistic. One song even has ""na, na, na"" in it. You almost can't believe that the same band that turned out the above mentioned classics, with their soulful guitar, dynamite lyrics, and truly ""classic"" appeal, could produce this latest effort. It seems like they just ""whipped it out in a hurry"". Come on guys. Listen to some Zeppelin for a few hours. Watch the Woodstock movie. Even spark it up, if you have to. Then give us something that you'll be proud of in 10 years -- something they'll still play on the radio."
5,best cd I've heard in a long time,I just wanted to reassure everyone that the real Black Crowes are now back! This is truly the best cd I've bought in a long time & I recommend it to all.
3,From a Fan,"I must confess that I have enjoyed the four previous releases from the Black Crowes. I know, I know, the last two were not supposed to have been up to par - but, honestly, I liked them all. When I heard that By Your Side was coming - well, I couldn't wait. Honestly, I am a bit let down in that I really enjoyed the direction the band was taking. This CD is fine; not really a bad song on it; but, something is missing that I always found on the other four. Can't quite put my finger on it. I know this one is being compared to the early Stones, the Faces, etc. I hear it, but I really think they left something of themselves out this time. At any rate, I've listened through it several times and will continue to play it. If you like the Black Crowes, if you like good southern rock - give it a try. I doubt you will regret buying it. If you are like me, though, I think you will eventually find yourself playing their earlier stuff more."
2,A band on the downside of its career....,"The Black Crowes first three albums were great, but I think they reached their peak with Amorica. They have been on a down slide since then, and this cd just continues that trend. Sorry guys, but this is my last Black Crowes purchase...they just seem to have exhausted all their good ideas for songs."
2,B.C fan,This crowes album was by far their worst album to date....whith their departure of bassist Johnny Colt...and lead guitarist Marc Ford...the band has suffered spiritualy and musically...Chris's lyrics are leering more to the clesche Rock..girl relationship bullcrap lyrics...Three Snakes And One Charm had alot more depth and soul in the music...The only song I really dig is HorseHead..because it funks out and it aint about some lovey dubby sappy girl song... Buy Amorica or Three Snakes...those albums will make you cry it's so spritual... Peace and Soul... Zed
4,Back to their roots.,"On this one, they go back to what they do best. This is a return, musically, to the sound they had on their first CD. They strip away everything else and just get back to basic rock 'n' roll, something they do better than most groups out there. My only minor comlaint is that the songwriting isn't up to their usual standards."
5,The Black Crowes are RAW,"Take a seat on the old stool, and pop in this CD because it is the best rock album out right now. Mike Snowden Plays the lead guitar with such gusto that I sometimes cry when I listen to that one congregation song. Ethan skeels does wonders with his banjo, and Shawn ""MINI MAN"" Smith plays enter sandman perfectly. Gorbie on the drums couldn't have played any better on this album. If you get any album in your life, get this one. Its awesome. And of course, if you aint down with the black crowes, I got 2 words for ya"
5,Crowes ROCK on this album!!!!,"I saw the Crowes live at the Aregon in Chicago before I heard the album and they cooked. I bought the album and it was like I was still at the concert. Great fans, great album. Chicago loves the Crowes. I can't wait to see them again May 8th."
4,"it ain't amorica, but hey-- it's still damn good....","i saw the crowes do some warm-up shows at the roxy in LA and they blew the doors off the place with the new stuff. true, they relied heavily on older tunes, but i was impressed with the new songs. that guy audrey (new lead guitarist) seems kinda like a poser, ala ""leg up on the floor amp, lean back and play like it's just killing you"" but that was forgivable. i miss marc ford. no messin' around with him. amorica is one of the best albums of all time. i can't figure out what anybody's problem with that one was. ""by your side"" ranks up there with ""three snakes"" for me. good, solid effort. it's what i love about the crowes. you know what you're going to get, and you sure as hell get it."
2,Disappointing,"If it were any other band, I'd probably rate this higher, but my boys just took a bad turn. I don't know what Chris was thinking when he wrote these lyrics. How he went from the poetic ""Girl From a Pawnshop"" off of Three Snakes to ""Heavy"" and ""Kickin' My Heart Around"" is beyond me. He used to write the best words. Also, the album has too much noise; if they've completely changed their style, I don't like it. Hopefully, they were just trying to get their name known again, and they'll go back to their good stuff from now on."
3,Bring back Marc Ford,"I'm a huge Crowes fan. Southern Harmony is by far their best album (I'd put it up next to the Stones or Zep in terms of all time rock albums), but this one just doesn't do it for me. Yeah, it's alright (and long overdue), but these guys really rocked when they had a little more hippie-dippie action going for 'em. I say get Marc Ford to deal with whatever he's got going on and get him back in action ripping those Allman's-esque riffs like it's nobody's business.My advice to the Crowes: Get on it and Spark one up!"
3,Great guitar work...lazy lyrics,"There arent many albums that are more fun than this for turning up the volume and testing your eardrums. But the ""youre the girl for me...i hope we stay together forever"" lyrics get tired really fast. Not all the songs have connect the dot lyrics. ""Virtue and Vice"" and ""Horsehead"" are bonafide Crowe's classics. But what about ""Heavy""? Perhaps they were intending to be funny with this, but it doesnt work. With lyrics like ""The way you put on your clothes, the way you wiggle your toes, the way you scratch your nose"" this song , after the cool guitar riff wears off, becomes a skipper and perhaps the most embarrassing song in the Crowes catalogue. But its forgivable because on their next release, they got back to the tortured soul search for enlightenment type lyrics on Lions and again on Warpaint. I guess one trip down the cheeseball highway in a bands career wont taint their legacy."
2,VERY AVERAGE,When THE BLACk CROWES FIRST CAME Out they seem Like they were gonna be Huge.They Had a Strong Southern Rock thing Going On.but as Time has Gone on The Words&Music Seem So/So at best.Diamond Ring&By Your Side were My Favorite Cuts on Here but Other than that I Got The Feeling they were Looking For a New Direction&Couldn't Reach that Point.They Are Missing their Edge.
4,By Your Side & In Your Guts,"The title track here simply soars to this listener's ears. I didn't turn the volume below 9 until the 12th listen of track #3. I was extremely glad to hear the Crowes getting back to rockin' blues, after the indifferent previous releases. When a song hits me as hard as ""By Your Side"" hits me, you've got somethin! And the rest of the disc is terrific too. ""Go tell the congregation"" and ""virtue & vice"" are certainly notable."
2,retirement is a brilliant idea,"Chris Robinson should kick himself out of the band for these lyrics. A poor effort from a once wonderful band. Hang it up, lads."
3,Virtues outweigh vices,"3 1/2BYS wasn't the blazing return-to-form following a heavily (some unfairly) criticized ""3 Snakes.."", but existed in the certifiably acceptable middle-ground between their straightforward blues rock and melodically ambitious sides to moderate success."
5,The Black Crowes Rock Again,"After a few mediocre albums, the Black Crowes have recorded their best album. Yes, even better than their excellent 1990 debut, Shake Your Money Maker. From the first song, ""Go Faster,"" to the epic ""Virtue and Vice,"" this album rocks like I thought the Black Crowes would never rock again. It also the absolute best kick drum sound I have ever heard - big, tight and mixed WAY up front. By Your Side gets my vote for best rock album of 1999."
5,The Black Crowes are incredible!!,"One of the last great southern rock bands is back, and in a big way! By Your Side is a great cd which conveys the southern rock and roll styles that has been sorely missed for the past few years. This is true rock and roll at it's finest. If you enjoy Aerosmith or the Rolling Stones, I recommend this cd. The first single ""Kickin My Heart Around"" sums up what the Crowes are about. They might not have the most talent in the world, but they are great at what they do, rock hard! A must hear!"
3,Certainly not the best Crowes,"I can't believe that some reviewers have said that this is the best Black Crowes album. It is not. Their first three albums (Shake Your Money Maker, Southern Harmony..., and Amorica) easily top this effort. What hurts the most, I think, are the lyrics. I don't mind love songs, I guess, but this is too much. Cliched and lame. As for the music, sure it's catchy, but that's all it has going for it for the most part. Now this album isn't all bad. The first four tracks are good, and I don't mind Virtue and Vice. The problem is I've heard the previous Crowes albums, which blow this out of the water. If you have heard these albums and find them a but much, or if you like more radio friendly music, you may very well like this album. It is better than a lot of material out there today. But for truly great albums, check out the first three Crowes efforts. Here's hoping the Black Crowes reunion happens and they get back to their rockin ways. Amen."
5,Do NOT listen to naysayers-this disc is FANTASTIC!!,"To all the 'drugged-out, post-hippie' fans of the Black Crowes..put down your doobies for a week or so and re-listen to this fabulous disc! This is by FAR their best,albeit most 'commercial' sounding release. Obviously, this is not what every fan of the band wanted from them. But if you enjoyed what they were trying to achieve on 'Shake Your Moneymaker', how can anyone deny the musical growth AND extremely catchy vibes of every single song on this masterpiece?! Please don't be put off from buying this because of the negative reviews. This is easily the Black Crowes I'd have liked to have heard way more of. Sadly-they decided to climb back into 'obscurityland'on their final disc,the somewhat lame 'Lions'. What a HUGE disappointment after this gem! Buy NOW & enjoy.."
2,Two game losing streak,"I was hoping that this album would prove that the weak effort of ""Three Snakes and a Charm"" was just a small bump in the road of an otherwise magnificent career. Unfortunately, ""By Your Side"" is a much worse album than anything they have done to date. Normally, this would not bother me to much, except that I know that any band that can come up with ""Southern Harmony and Musical Companion,"" one of the greatest pieces of rock n' roll ever made, can do much, much better. If there is any consolation, it is ""Welcome to the Goodtimes Baby,"" which is not a bad little tune. Otherwise, it's back to the drawing board for the Robinson brothers."
3,big big guide,"I bought this guide for my son, who was planning to spend a year in Europe, working and travelling. While there is a lot of information available on the internet about this subject, this book steered him to various sites and provided overall information that allowed him to plan effectively.He ended up getting a job for 8 months and enjoyed himself immensely. So I can only assume it was a help.PS: it is a BIG giude. Not suitable for travelling!"
4,It's a BIG guide,"This guide does cover many, if not, all the major aspects of living and working overseas, mainly from an American / Canadian point of view.There is a lot of information packed into ~3 pounds of paper (it IS heavy). There are many handy tips and practical tips, especially for first-timers looking to live and work overseas. But a lot of it can be obtained elsewhere (e.g. from the net). Overall, I would say, if you are after an all-in-one guide / reference book, this is by far the most comprehensive guide in print form I've come across on the market for the American / Canadian market.The key additions to the 4th edition comes in ""soft-copy"" in a CD-Rom - the printed version remains more or less the same. I found the previous editions sufficiently adequate - unless you are looking for something specific that wasn't covered in the previous editions."
2,LOTS OF FAKE REVIEWS,"I just wanted to point out that a lot of these reviews are fake, probably from the publisher. How do I know this? Because people from Laguna Beach, California do not spell favorite like ""favourite"". Try harder next time publisher."
5,Ride The Tempest....,"Very solid yet different release by the Clowns this time around. No more Joker Cards to keep you guessing what's next, just The Tempest that thankfully is way better than The Calm. Now that Mike Clark is back on the boards, the wicked ones are noticeably back at home. This one is filled with songs that are sure to make anyone's head bob."
3,"Gift for Adult son, Not For Children or most adults.",Not for Children and most adults would find subject objectionable. Not a gift I would buy for myself.
4,Inner city players,"Well ICP or Inner city players are doing it agian with their muzic. This cd is a combo or rap, blues, reggie and soul. I personaly love the song I do this! It is a song that relates what it is like to sell your body for crack. They even go into details about their homosexual love life with a young boy named fresco. I Love this CD!!!!!"
4,The Wraith done right,"I have been listening to ICP for 9 years and I have been really dissapointed with their past few releases. When I heard they were getting back with their old producer, I was suddenly excited to hear a new ICP album for the first time in a few years.Overall, I think this is probably the best ICP album since The Amazing Jeckel Brothers. Bizaar/Bizzar had a few good songs, but I absolutely couldn't stand The Wraith Shangri-la, Hells Pit, or The Calm. I have no idea why they ever got rid of Mike Clark to begin with, but The Tempest obviously shows that Mike Clark is clearly needed to make a decent ICP album. The majority of the songs on this album are great, but I am giving it 4 stars because there were a few songs they really should have done without. But this is The Wraith done right. If they had released this as the 6th joker's card instead, I would have been much happier."
4,"Not wicked, but good album.","A lot of people are saying that this album isn't wicked, and they're right, but it IS a good album. I think by now we should all except that ICP's wicked days are behind them, but at least with Mike E. Clark back, they can still make good music. Ride The Tempest, Haunted Bumps, Watch My Ride, The Tower, Bitch I Lied and Play My Song are all great tracks, and for the first time in a long time, this ICP cd could stay in your cd player for a while."
3,not great,"Its not the best ICP album to date. I couldn't wait to hear some new wicket music but, it just wasn't there. I know they are going in a new direction but, this just isn't it. There are a few hot tracks. I would say the album is half hot and half ice cold. I'm just disappointed in this one when we all have been waiting so long for it to come."
3,hard to use,"I used this guide as well as the Lonely Planet Tanzania one 6 months ago for my trip. I was in Zanzibar for only a week. I found it hard to use and ended up using only the LP Tanzania guide because it had enough information for my short stay.If you're just going to Zanzibar and staying longer than 2 weeks, then it may be more useful. However, if you have less than two weeks on Zanzibar, this book is too overwhelming. If you're traveling on a budget like me, just get a Tanzania guidebook that has Zanzibar in it. This book added bulk to my luggage and contains a lot of information that will waste time to go through. You can use it to read about the island before you go though."
5,Bradt Guides are the best guides for Africa,"I love this book. Its got just enough really interesting history and cultural facts, written in a very readable way. The kind of book you can actually read when you have run out of novels whilst lying on a beach. Most of the write ups for the places we visited were spot on. Really helpful book."
3,good review of early America from one that was there.,This is a great review of Early Americaa from one that was there and very involved in the process of declaring America free and representing America in the UK and France.
3,Ben franklin,"Good review, but jumps around a bit too much. At times hard to figure out time and place. Otherwise good summary."
2,Autobiography of Ben Franklin,"After reading Walter Isaacson's, Ben Franklin, An American Life, the Autobiography of Ben Franklin by Benjamin Franklin was a huge disappointment. Written in the original, King's English, it is not an enjoyable read. If you want to experience the character and personality of Benjamin Franklin then read Isaacson's biography."
4,Autobiography Written by a Great American!,"Benjamin Franklin, no matter which way you look at him, was a great American. I love the stories and folktales about him, his life and his wonderful words and sayings. This autobiography of his life was written by Ben Franklin when he was sixty-five. It was written in letter format to his son, and it he reminiscences about his eventfull early life. Throughout we see Benjamin's powerful literary style and his great humour. This autobiography is well worth a visit if only to get a first-hand look at a very colourful historical American."
2,review,The style of writing of the 1700's is very difficult for a person of the 2000's. I will finish it. Eventually I will grasp the whole book. He did lead a very interesting life and accomplished a great many things.
3,Ben Franklin,"I am glad to have read this. I found some interesting facts about Ben, but found it hard to stick with it. It took me a while to finish reading it, though it was well written. Just my own quirk."
3,Old man,"Interesting life of the famous man,even more interesting to note how self-gratifying he is. Wonderful and accomplished, but in his autobiography, he is always right. Anything that goes wrong is someone else's fault. Not very likely..."
5,Ben Franklin,"It is nice to read a book about one of our founding fathers, it is truly an amazing story of Ben, I encourage you to read it."
5,Should be mandatory reading for all students.,"I believe I read some of it in grade school. I've read it twice as and adult and am still inspired to be a better man.It shows what hard work, good motivesand faith in God and our fellow man can accomplish."
4,Amazing insigt into B.F.'s live,I recomand it in order to see with your own eyes how determination and hard work pays off. A powerful insight into the life of a modest and industrious man.
4,Self determination,This autobiography takes one back to colonial times from 1706 through about 1760 and illustrates America's spirit of individual determination. How interesting to compare Franklin's views of personal integrity as a leader to what the USA leaders represent today. The book has led me to John Adams biography by John McCullough to give another view of Franklin and of the times.
4,good and interesting read,"this book is a good read and jumps around a lot, but i enjoyed learning and reading it. thank you."
3,"Should be titled ""Partial Autobiography""","Unknown to me at the start of this book was the fact that thisauto does not include his prospective as the colonies relationship with England began to fracture, experiences crafting the constitution nor exploits in France during the revolution. I still would have probably read the book if I was aware of this, but with a completely different expectation."
2,boring and unclear,"book club recommented, i hoped to undertand him better as a human, father and to understand the significance of his life to America."
3,Hard read,Hard to get into as it is written in old English style. Would prefer a book on him penned by modern writer.
2,Boring,I muddled through the old world language of his early adult years and enjoyed reading about how different colonial America was and how people just freely moved wherever life took them but then we hit the big gap where he didn't write and after that all he covered was his philosophy of life. I quit reading half way through the book.
3,The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin,"This book is only about 100 pages; much smaller than I expected. Also, while I expected it to be in the form of a typical autobiographical narrative, this 'autobiography' is presented by means of letters, from Benjamin Franklin to others. While it is good to learn about Benjamin Franklin and, thus, this is a valuable read, it is not an easy nor fast read. The writing is in the 'old' colonial style and not a style nor format of which I feel comfortable. However, don't pass by the opportunity to read this book for its value; just don't expect it to be more than it is."
5,What a wonderful book,Brilliant honest man. Would have been a leader in any era of civilization. We are blessed he left these words for our benefit.
5,Very good information on how to live your life!!!,I find it amazing that Benjamin Franklin discovered and was the first to bring in the follow:Fire DepartmentsLibrariesOf Course Electricity from LighteningAlso he had wonderful insights in to morals and how to live our lives. I wish some of his other papers had survived. He talks about some of his writing being destroyed or taken by the British during the Revolutionary War in America.
3,Informative but not in depth,"Helped with the research paper. Would have liked more information, but it did get the job done for me at this time"
4,very interesting,"I love history, so this written by Benjamin Franklin is very interesting especially since I am descended from people who lived in New England in the same time frame."
2,"Interesting in parts, but difficult to follow","First, the good parts about this book :* written in a very conversational style* does a good job of enlisting his virtues, many of which are relevant even today* has several interesting anecdotesNow, the not so good parts about the book :* desultory commentary, and is jumpy between incidents (and thus, one has to try really hard to make sense of what all was happening)* at least half of the book has too many details, which digress from the point and thus, the reader can get lost in the details* written in old english, which made it even more difficult to understand the gaps in the narrative"
5,Truly a Timeless Classic,"This book is a must read for people of all ages. I don't know about the 'Dover Thrift Editions', I got mine at Barnes and Noble, so I suggest you check that version out. Old Ben Franklin was an amazing man, he truly was. This book is one of the best I have ever read. This is a must read for everyone! I can't believe we never read this in school! It should be a mandatory read.Anyway, please read this book and I assure you, you will enjoy this insightful, unprecedented man. I promise you will. How there are so few men of that class today!"
4,Great Thinker,"I didn't realize that so many of his ideas are used, without knowing where they came from. Thanks for sending this book."
4,Read after reading a biography of Benjamin Franklin,"Don't make this the first book you read about Ben Franklin....you wouldn't appreciate it as much or get the most of it. Read a top biography of Benjamin Franklin first (the one byBenjamin Franklin: An American Lifeis great). Once you have a good knowledge about the man's life, personality, and accomplishments/different stages of life, then you can go to this book and really enjoy it.Equip yourself with Ben's life and acquaint yourself with his personality before you tackle his auto biography."
4,Book Review,It was interesting to compare the autobiography with the biographies that I have read of his life. It provides good insight into his religious and philosophical views.
3,benjamins,Not too long ago I heard a report on the life of Ben Franklin on NPR. I found it fascinating wondering when he had the time to do everything he did. I'm glad I read this autobiography despite feeling it had some glaring holes in the life of the man. It still had resonance because it was his words and not some third party. For that reason I can recommend it.I will read the other biography suggested by other reviewers. Thanks for the tips.
4,Is this really THE BEN FRANKLIN?,"As I read this indepth study/profile of Ben Franklin and I read little to believe it was the Ben that signed the declaration of Independence. This was a Super period book on the hardships for life and even on how early White Slavery worked and how Ben survived/dealt with his slavery. Indentured for as much as 20 years and jailed if you tried to run. At every page, I was amazed at what I read. It was also one of the many free KINDLE books I have read and enjoyed. THE BOOK WOULD BE RATED AS 5 STARS except for the out of usage words used in this ""period book"". Kindle was super at auto-defining those obscure terms. PS Memorize which keys have which letters, they rub off of the Kindle very quickly."
2,The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin,"The reader needs to be prepared for the minute information included in this autobiography - most of which is boring. However, for it to have been written by Benjamin Franklin himself makes it a little more interesting."
3,Autobiography of Ben Franklin,"I was disappointed. I am an admirer of the good Dr. and figured I'd go to the source! Well, what I read was fine ... but it ended rather abruptly. It seemed like maybe his effort was never truly finished. It stops in the middle of life. There was still so much left to write!!!"
3,More a history book than an autobiography!,"The book starts very well with the description of Franklin's childhood. You get to know that he has a special character and that he will have success in the future. There are some nice anecdotes about the life in the 18th century as well. But as the book continous to outline the life of Franklin there are more and more descpriptions of military decisions made by him. The book looses the soul of an autobiogrphy (no more info on how he felt, on what was on his mind during that time). It even seems to be put together in a hurry (which is believable, due to the fact that Franklin had a very busy life).However, it is still worth reading because of Franklin's positive attitude towards life which everyone should be able to copy."
3,Benjamin Who?,"No one is going to argue about Fanklins' personal greatness. Still fewer are going to dispute the great impact his work had on this country.While reading this review, however, I found myself lost several times due to the meandering nature of the narritive. As he was a printer, and a person that prided himself for having a lot of ""follow through"", I was suprised to find the autobiography irrelevant, mainly because of the lack of thought devoted to the constuction of the work.Also, I found it stoic, and hard to get to know Franklin as a man."
2,Kindle book,Download went great. It has been a difficult read due to the way it was written. The historical side of the book is great.
2,Beg to differ,"While the book gives some interesting insights into Franklin's life, it is really a disjointed diary kept during his early days and during his very late life. It fails to deliver the real picture. I was particularly disappointed that it provided only but a mention of Franklin's early electricity experiments. Most of his middle life was missing. Amazon offers the book free so, you get what you pay for. I would rather read a studied biography."
2,slow,interesting and well worth a read but difficult with the old English at times and tends to be long winded and rambles somewhat
4,Very interesting read,"This is one of the first downloads for my new kindle,mainly because it was free and I am sort of a history buff.I wasn't at all disappointed.I found it easy to read and full of fun facts that I just didn't know about Benjamin Franklin.Why don't they teach this stuff in school?If you enjoy history as I do you can't go wrong with this one."
4,Ben was an funny man!,Very interesting read; however the style in that era is not like we write today. Takes a little getting used to then it flows pretty well! I would recommend it!
5,Life changing book. Turns slacker into scholars.,"This book changed my life. I read it while in college and it changed my slacker attitude to that of a scholar. Franklin was a great man in his time. The reviewer ""barnesgene@aol.com from Fairfax County, Virginia"" is very wrong and a bit snobbish. He does not pretend to be the greatest writer, but Franklin utters the importance of self-knowledge and learning. From a boy to an adult his life story is a grand representation of the scholar in all of us."
4,"Sorry, I liked it","It is Franklin's ""regularness""--his down-to-earth regularity--that makes this such a great story. Here is a great man who was accomplished in many fields showing us that he is just a regular guy who worked hard. I, for one, don't need to be drowned in pedantry to consider a work valid. He was not attempting to make a philisophical treatise, he was just telling his life's story for the benefit of his son. It is an inspriing story of success filled with amusing anecdotes and common-sense. Read it!"
2,The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin (Dover Thrift Editions),I didn't realize this book was written in such small print. This is the only thing I don't like about it. Sorry!
3,Book,Good writting for a look at one of our founding fathers. Should be required reading for younger kids in school.
5,school resource,I love that I can get these older writings free for the Kindle. It makes a huge difference in our homeschooling budget.
3,Non-Fiction,"This says Norton Critical Edition, so, of course, designed for academic study.A man that of course did a whole pile of stuff and came up with a whole pile more.Entertaining at times, and lecturing at others, as you might expect from someone that had been in a privileged position."
5,wha's the arcana imperi?,"franklin says he read the book George III's policy's are based on, the 'arcana imperi?' what's that about? and where do I find it?"
2,autobiography of ben franklin,"Didn't get to read it due to reading another book about Left Gomez and actually, i'm still not finish with that book."
2,Didacticism at its finest,"Benji Franklin is a fascinating guy. He really is. Unfortunately, you really don't get to know him through his autobiography (it was written for the moral instruction of his son, first of all).Half the book reads like a ""Mrs. Manners"" column and the other half reads like a resume. Franklin lists all his numerous contributions to American society fairly coldly and not a little pretentiously (but we can allow him the pretention) and fills in the blank spaces with moral and philosphical instruction. ]While he was a great inventor and statesman and had a knack for collecting and spitting out trite ""truisms,"" Benny just isn't that interesting a moral philospher. If you're really interested in getting to know Ben Franklin, check out a scholar's biography--if anything, you get to learn all the juicy stuff about his disgustingly promiscuous sex life."
5,My sponsor said to read this and the Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám,"Earl P's gone now. 38 years sober. He always related to this book and the Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám. I've just now got my Droid 2 and the kindle app and am reading this book. In Service and Gratitude, Earl...James A."
1,Franklin's Just a Regular Guy. Now Go Read Something Else.,"Sometimes pastiches work well, like Bach's B Minor Mass. Not so this autobiography. Thrown together, arbitrary, sinfully pedestrian, this is one book that you can easily miss in your short life. Franklin shows you he's just a regular guy with regular thought processes. He drifts through life sometimes helping people and sometimes taking advantage of them. He may be an early humanitarian, but he is also an early capitalist, and he knows what he wants. Great, so does Ted Turner, but you don't see us going ape for his life story, do you? Franklin was truly one of our greatest founding fathers, but you won't get a glimmer of that from this book. Reading anybody else's account of Franklin's life would be a much more rewarding experience. Go there if you must do Franklin."
3,Wavering,"I attempted to listen to the audio presentation of this book. It was narrated by Walter Costello. One of the historical personalities I admire is Ben flanklin. The narration is boring, no inflexion in his voice. If you are giong to pick up this audiobiography, do not listen to the audio book, choose another method by which to enjoy it. The novel, itself, is very well written. Franklin had such a command of the english language his intelligence is in every sentence. I would recommend this in hard copy, paper back, or kindle, NOT audio."
3,yet another classic,.it was a freebie. it was a paperless book. why not take advantage of it right? not like WHOA! book!
4,very informative,Benjamin Franklin sure was long winded. Can take forever talking about just about anythign in his life. He was a great man in his day and did alot for his country. We could use more men like him in the whitehouse nowadays.
3,Ben again,I remember next to nothing about him from school history.His auto places him in a good light.I guess if I really wanted to know about him I would not read an autobiography.
3,Interesting History,This book yielded many interesting facts about Ben Franklin but it is short and leaves out much about the man's many talents and accomplishments. The fact that it was written by Ben himself added to it's value and veracity.
3,Gives you just enough to want more...,"The book is divided into four parts, and is ultimately unfinished; that is the largest disappointment you will find as you read the last sentance. However, the book gives you a true feel for the life and times this great man lived through. The writing is very arbitrary, almost (but not quite) stream-of-conscious, and anecdotal, but enjoyable. Another disappointment is the lack of discussion of the American Revolution and his role in it. But it did give me the desire to read more of this amazing individual, and renewed my sense of pride in my country, as well as its interesting history. Read this book as a beginning, with expectations of it taking your mind to a different level of interest..."
4,Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin,"Far from a ""boring read"", Franklin's work gives an unique insight into the 18th century working class people. Much that has been written about Franklin is absolute rubbish. His autobiography puts the man in real perspective. Granted he was a bit self centered and, at times, self congradulating, but his accomplishments were many. His wit is often stinging. I was surprised to read about his military activities and yet he was influenced by the Quakers. It's also significant that he talks of his belief in the deity and the fact that he was a presbetyrian. Many ""revisionist historians"" claim that Franklin was an atheist. This certainly suggests otherwise. Franklin will always be controversial, but never ""dull"". Another book to peruse is titled FART PROUDLY, also a Franklin work."
5,Great mind,Awesome read into one of the great minds of humanity. Everyone should read this I got a lot out of it
4,Interesting,"I like reading about history, and therefore this fits my interests. This person is a very interesting character that I enjoy to learn about"
5,Wow,An amazing man who wrote this autobiography in a chatty way to his son. Fascinating and informative about a very intelligent man.
5,Learning from a Master,"The joy of reading this autobiography comes from the personality of its writer, as Franklin discusses Franklin. His style is delightful and he feels present, here, now. His body has been dead for over two hundred years, but not his ideas and not his voice. The core of what he writes is strong, but his ideas and rules for living are alive and speak to the present. Before reading this book, I read a few harsh comments on both the book and Franklin. Writers said that Franklin falsely portrays himself as a fine guy and that he really wasn't so fine. I cannot believe that the writer of this autobiography was anything other than the voice that comes across the centuries. Such a strong and vital voice, such a story, such deeds, these could only come from a great man. Not a perfect man, but a great man. I enjoyed so much the library checkout that I immediately got on Amazon and ordered the book for my own library, to read and reread, learning and connecting with the author."
2,Boyhood Bio,"An interesting book only if you enjoy learning how people in earlier history thought and lived. I manage to read two or three pages a day, but it is not a ""pleasure"" read. I would never buy it, but as a free read, it's fine."
4,Surprisingly good!,"I was surprised as how good this was. I was not looking forward to reading it but there's a LOT under the surface. The was he manipulates the reader with subtlety at times and openly at others is, quite frankly (no pun intended), charming. It contains well written autobiographical stories and contains a lot of interesting and useful information for readers today.This is a great historical book to read. It exposes both the positives and negatives of early American/colonial history. I would definitely recommend this to readers interested in history."
3,Wonder why he didn't complete it....,"This a review of the free Kindle version. It's short, just over 2,000 locations, and gives a lot of detail about Franklin's early life in his own words. It's an interesting period piece, and shows a lot of the culture of the time. The story about the girl he thought about marrying, and the request that her family get a mortgage on their house so they could pay him 100 pounds to marry her is fascinating.The main issue for me is that it is incomplete. Would have liked to seen this finished, and not stopped at 1757. You would have thought he would have finished this.Still, worth a look for any student of history."
3,Independent review - The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin,"If you enjoy history; if you have an interest in the development of a new nation (America); if you are patient enough to plow through a story written in eighteenth century colonial English, then, you may find this to be an interesting, albeit abridged, personal account of Benjamin Franklin's life. The narrative doesn't flow smoothly, but if you stay with it, you will gain an inside look into the author's thoughts regarding his own life- His goals, successes, failures and more. Keep a dictionary handy as you read this book. If you haven't seen my first novel on Amazon, check out Angel's Bend - The Diary of Joshua Samuel Talmadge. Comments are welcome."
4,What you expect,"The book is what you expect. It is not an easy read, based on the old language used, but has good information."
5,"best ever,(so far)","This is so far the best book I have ever read...no where else will you get to experience a truly amazing, real life story that will push you to research more on the topics of genius men and women and their thought prosses."
3,Good,Good information on the early life of Ben Franklin. Too bad it does not continue. It is good to see a bit of why/how he wrote his other books.
3,Content so inspiring and language so tiring!,"Franklin's life, works and thoughts have always been an inspiration to me. This time around I decided to wade through his autobiography to drink from the source itself. Upon flipping a few pages, I was sorely disappointed of the extremely tedious language. I found I was caught up more in re-reading a lot of sentences trying to comprehend the great man's words correctly and hence losing out on the joy to mull over his visions. For me, ""Benjamin Franklin's the Art of Virtue: His Formula for Successful Living"" is a more streamlined book and I am happy with the joy I derive from the inspiration this book evokes."
2,The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin,"It didn't keep me engaged and wanting to continue reading it. I found it ""dry"" and not interesting. I never finished it. I believe it was a ""Free"" book, glad I didn't pay for it!"
2,Read a biography,"I must agree with all of the previous reviwers who acknowlegde that Franklin is a facisnating man and played a major role in the creation of this nation, but you would never know from this book. It completely ignores his affect on the Declaration of Independence, his influence on American thinking, and most of his key inventions are skimmed over in a sentance or two. His writing style is certainly antiquated (which is understandable) but it makes it a difficult read, especially since it is boring to begin with. I think it would be a much better plan to read a biography by someone else who read through this book, save yourself the agony of getting through this story and learn more about the man then you do here."
1,Ben Franklin,Boring Boring boring I fell asleep reading this book I'm never reading thisAgain it's plain boring boring i tell you zzzzzzzz
1,Horrible and unreadable,"Written in old style English.Authentic in that extent but unreadable and almost frustrating to complete.If you have a knack for not giving up halfway and you don't ever wish to break that trend, don't be tempted by this book.Skip it."
1,I read this book for college,If you like auto-biographies of egomaniacs that have lived a lewd and lacivious life. Go ahead and read it. I didn't like it. I could put zero stars but amazon wouldn't let me.
3,"excellent tapes, but one of the set of four was missing.","This is one of the best audiotapes I have ever heard, BUT of the four cassettes supposed to be in the box, only three were there. Those three were well worth the price, however, and delivery was prompt, condition good otherwise."
4,Famous for a reason,"As an Australian not well versed in American history, a lot of the later chapters involving war were lost on me. However Benjamin Franklin is an extremely inspiring person and his list of virtues have found a place in how I want to organize my life and my future."
2,Disappointing,"I thought this would be full of wit and wisdom along with salicous bits of gossip. Nope. An old man (venerable as he was) trying to remember. However, If I could read in the 18th century, this probably would be a best seller."
2,book,Might recommend if purchaser/reader were a history buff. Found difficult to follow and keep up with. Not a book I would recommend for easy reading.
2,A disappointment,"I am a history lover and was excited to read this autobiography by Ben Franklin. I found it to be a great disappointment, since Franklin's writing ability did not shine in this book. He gave lots of details about trivial (and at times boring)circumstances and events, yet gave no information about other things of great interest to me -- for example his wife and family life and the entire American Revolution. The book suddenly ends, as if the author was tired of the project, and simply closed up shop."
4,You won't find the revolutionary Franklin here.,"This is a autobiography of his early years. He actually finished the second half of it thirty years later when he claims he has enough time & before he became too old. The two halves have been edited seamlessly. In this we see just hints of what England's future relations with the colonies will be. Franklin has considerable business relations with the British military & makes his fortune in business by the time he is fifty. He is just getting his feet damp in politics being one of the framers of the Albany Plan of Union in 1754. There is much in this of the Franklin we do not know. It is informal & personal. With all its facinating anedotes it would have been lost to the world if he hadn't been urged to write it. America first true international super star, but by the end of this book, not yet."
2,Bored to death,"Most boring thing I have ever read...no wonder it was free. He was a very interesting man, but I would rather read another version of his life."
3,Damian Dame Doesn't Find Exclusive Barriers,"Damian Dame's self-titled debut was released in 1991 on the popular La Face record label owned by Babyface and LA Reid. The material is excellently produced but otherwise routine new jack swing/urban contemporary material. Damian Dame sang with a deep sincerity and seriousness, but lacked much diversity and power to make this release as memorable as other new jack swing releases. Though, the LaFace family featured a team of highly skilled hit makers like Daryl Simmons and De Rock, not to mention Edmonds and Reid. Even the background vocal arrangements are in top-knotch form; Tye-V, Kevon Edmonds, and Debra Hurd. The hit single ""Exclusivity"" hit No. 1 on the R&B charts, and just missed the top-40 on the Billboard Hot 100; ""Right Down To It"" hit No. 3 on the R&B charts, and ""Gotta Learn My Rhythm"" hit No. 20 on the R&b charts."
3,One & Done,"This group was new and one of Laface's projects in 1991.They remind me a lot of the former group Aurra back in the 80's.The female has a beautiful voice.The first single they release was Exclusivity which was a fast tempo song that will have you doing the head nod.The lady really shows her skills on the tracks of ""Virgin Island & When I'm crying"".Two really lovemaking slow tracks.I'm not sure what happen after they debuted with this cd but rumor has it that one of them died before they could get back in the studio for a follow up cd.If you don't have this cd I strongly recommend that you get it before it's completely out of existence.U won't regret it & you're be able to smile when your friends hear it and tell you they never heard of Damian Dame and where can they get a copy."
5,Excellent experience! Would buy from again.,Excellent experience! Book as described. Good price. Quick ship. Well packed. Would buy from again.
2,Cheapy,"Within a few days of wearing this watch the star studs started falling out. A few months after owning the watch the three fell off inside the glass. I barely wore the watch after two studs fell out. It is sweet looking when it first arrives, but keep an eye out for silver star studs falling out if you ever where it."
3,Detailed and infomative book for history buffs,"Notable primarily for the summary of all of Jamestown's military history (from 1607 on) as well as the information on military units, confederate units, ammunition, etc. Historically accurate but not written in the most lively style. Sure to be interesting to historical buffs, who are likely to find information here not contained in other books on the subject."
1,The Ultra-PC Comic Book,"If you liked Miller's Dark Knight series, you probably won't like this one. In fact, unless you're into extreme political correctness, you won't like this one.All the good guys are minorities. All the bad and dumb ones are white. And so on. This seems like an 180-degree reversal from his Batman books, which were somewhat negative on liberal issues (well, justice, at least).But Miller obviously wanted it to be a work on par with Moore's ""Watchmen"" - why else waste Gibbon's talent on this book? Perhaps it was a catharsis, because it seems like a lot of venting - against Reagan, against white males, against evil phallic space stations, against ... well, enough said. Read ""Watchmen"" again instead. Or why waste time with comic books? Although Moore's stuff is always interesting, most comic-book philosophy is at the pop level. Sounds deep and attractively cynical ... until you delve. Read something serious. Recommendations: ""Darwin's Black Box"" (Behe), ""Nature's Destiny"" (Denton)."
3,A little more planning could have went a long way !!,"His approach for making reusable classes is a good one but Errors in the Header files make it annoying especially since there is no support site for correction's.Also should have made more use of the STL he states that not all compiler's support it.Some of the explanation's were confusing in spots mainly due to poor sentance structure.None of the header files seem to be copywrighted which suggests it might not be his , but in the GNU.If you Know About C++ and Neural Networks this book should get you off and Running. Since most who would use this Book are probably using one of various Window's framework's I would not let errors scare you off. Since some re-wrighting would be necessary ."
1,Book* b = this->book; delete b;,"I am a scientist and an experienced software developer. This book kind of skims the surface of four basic neural network architectures, and provides a plethora of horribly written source code as a sort of ""tool kit"" for ANN development. After reading the book and trying to make use of the source (which I basically threw out and wrote my own, truly object-oriented tool kit), it's not clear just how much the author really knows about ANNs and OO programming (e.g., Lots of necessary details are sometimes skipped or glossed over; I've never seen so much non-template implementation in header files before: this is not the way to write OO code). I became so disgusted with this book that I decided to write this review. I would not recommend this book to anyone who wishes to delve into ANNs."
3,Abstract insight.,"My review of this book, will be much like the book itself.The book introduces you to basic concepts as any good book should. It follows up with a quick refresher on C++ topics whichwill be used, and explains why. It hastily progresses to quicklyskim different types of nerual-networks in a review.My personal problem is the implimentation of these NNs.The author does a good job of explaining what the types of NNsare good for certain goals, but by the next NeuralNetwork topic, has failed to go anywhere with it.Overall there is no buildup or end goal with the book, just a detailed code elaboration of various NN concepts. Granted, takingtheory and explaining it into code terms must be a difficult task. For myself, I feel left with only a partial book. Its a good ""introduction"" text, but it lacks body to really do alot with it."
4,"Lacks good C++ style, but design concepts very good","I have to agreed with the major of reviewers, but I think many have missed the point. As a C++ programmer and Neural Network Developer, the basic concepts of design and reuse are very good. I have remaked may of these into my own NN library and continue to improve upon it. Why he decided to use his own link list instead of the standard template libraries vector or list class is a mystery to me, but was very easy to implement into my library as was many other modifications I have made and expanded. The one thing I didn't care for was his examples as they provided no explaination, nor reason."
2,Not that great of a learning guide,This is more like example code than what I'd expect out of a textbook. I would recommend another book instead.
4,Good,"A great book for begginers! This book explains how to USE neural networks, but, not WHY neural networks works! Thats the problem ith this book! But is very good!"
4,Gentlemen,"Leader of this group of men going into the Yukon Gold Field was an English man who had vowed not to cross into American Territory, disliking Americans. He was admired by his three comrades. He was strong willed, would not ask his comrades to do anything he wouldn't do. Even when given advice from knowledgable frontier men he continued on his path losing the lives of two of his men. A wonderful description of the characters of all the men involved in this journey."
2,"Great Author but so, so story","I have to admit. I have so high of expectations for Mr. Michener that when he doesn't hit a home run I'm disappointed. This book is OK, it is short compared to all his other books. He only used his old trick once where he reintroduces a character, the one feamle of the book, then brings her back. She was introduced, forgotten, then found stranded in literally nowhere, and rescued by the heroes. Also something different in this book was a chapter of reflection by the author. Many claim the book is about Canada. I sensed very little Canadian, except for the fact that they were traveling through Canada. I believe Mr. Michener could of detailed the Canadian characters a bit more, showing how they came to and adapted to this rugged country."
2,Not the best of Michener's works,"Michener's books are always interesting quality historical novels. This was is goodhistory but not easy reading. To anyone who was not in the military, his characters mayseem unreal, but believe me, they aren't!!"
3,journey,"I can't imagine what Books On Tape had in mind when they chose their reader for James Michener's books. I don't expect every performer to be as skilled and entertaining as Frank Muller, but Larry McKeever is absolutely the worst I've come across. His narration lacks life, intonation, and everything needed to hold the reader's attention. The fact that he was chosen as a narrator is outrageous."
2,A New Definition,"I think I'm beginning to understand how popular fiction writing becomes ""Literature."" It apparently has to be depressing. If this is ""the best novel of Michener's career,"" as the Milwaukee Journal states it, then I don't need to depress myself further by reading the rest.I just don't believe it was necessary to kill off his major characters to make this a believable story."
3,Journey of English Aristocrats through two Canadian Winters,"The novel is the story of the adventure of a group of English aristocrats and an Irish servant travelling to find gold across Canada. It describes two harsh winters spent out in the wild and makes for a riveting read.The descriptions are vivid, characters are well-developed and word pictures compelling. Michener also writes a section at the end about how he came up with the idea for this book, as well as the research and process underlying the writing of this novel. This gives a good insight into how a book is developed and a glimples at the thinking process of a remarkable writer. This also makes for a good read. The book however does not compare favourably to other Michener efforts."
2,...Where the readers are drowned in the Mackenzie River,"Let's call a cat a cat. It is a weak Michener. If it is the first you read, it will probably your last. Michener, in the afterword, tells us that The Journey was originally in his book Alaska but was cut by the editor. He then took that section and made a book.The premises are good. A party of adventurers, including a snob British Lord, a poet, a retired Colonel and a cunning Irishman go on a journey to the Yukon River during the gold rush. This is too little to make a book.There is some good characters interraction, some good moments but they are drowned in the long repetitive parts of the journey, to the point where you keep thinking something will happen and...If you want a good Michener, look at my review of the Covenant or Poland, forget The Journey"
2,didn't work for my dog,This seemed to have no effect on my dog. He has severe separation anxiety and nothing seems to work. Oh well.
2,Didn't Seem to Help My Dog,"My rescue dog had pretty bad separation anxiety. I wanted to try this to see if it would ease some of the symptoms associated with separation anxiety. I didn't see any difference. I tried two of these, thinking that it might take a little longer, but it never really help my dog.It still might be worth a try for your dog. I can say that it certainly didn't hurt!If your dog is suffering, I still think it's worth a try."
2,Knockoff item,Not the same item. I had to get the correct one at my local pet store. Next time buyer beware.
5,"Calm, cool, and collected","LOVE IT!!! My dog has really bad separation anxiety. It was really bad the first few days that she was home. She howled all day. My neighbors told me they got this stuff for their cats, and it did the trick. I rushed to the store that day, and two days later, not even a whimper when I had to go to work. My dog is much more adjusted to me leaving and coming home."
5,"wrong item, again","this is the third time I've ordered Farnam's Comfort Zone DAP refill, which I like very much. But I continue to receive CEVA DAP Refill. The Comfort Zone Product is good and we have had some great results. Been using for almost 6 months now and I would not be without it."
4,Not sure if it's wishful thinking or the product really works...,"For rescue dogs, agitation is a big problem. They need time to adjust to a normal, less stressful life. DAP may help with this, but about the same time I also switched to home made dog food, started adding nutritional supplements to reduce their stress responses, so I'm not sure how much this product contributed to their mellowing. But the next time I introduce a new rescue dog into the pack I'll plug in the DAP aerator just to be sure."
4,It's a...WHALE...of a good time!,"Neat looking toy in terms of color and form. Resembles some kind of jetski or something. Fires four missles. One from the mouth, two from the fins, and one from the cannon on the handlebar apparatus. Mouth opens and tail flaps when rolled on ground. Fins even have a little articulation. Fits figures very nicely. Very fun and aerodynamic looking. Although I don't recommend doing it...I'm tempted to take this baby to the bathtub! Well worth it!"
2,Bizarre,"David Garnett (1892-1981) was a British writer and publisher who received literary recognition when his novel Lady into Fox was awarded the 1922 James Tait Black Memorial Prize for fiction.This particular work is as enigmatic as its writer and this particular reviewer failed to understand the work. The plot is simple enough: Sylvia, the 24-year-old wife of Richard Tebrick, suddenly turns into a fox while they are out walking in the woods. The rest of the story is the tale of Richard dealing with the transformation and his struggle to accept his wife's ego as she slowly loses her humanity to the fox form she inhabits.Is the story a morality play? Fictional essay? Eccentric novella? The last gasp of scandalous English yellow literature? Each reader will have to judge for his or her own."
5,Compact;concise.,"Great little book for the beginner.Portable,so you can take it with you on your nighttime prowling of the universe.Written in a manner that newbies such as myself can understand.A good companion to all my other amateur astronomy books.Inexpensive,as well.Not as comprehensive as those other books,but this is a field guide,and it serves its purpose well."
4,All you need to enjoy the night sky,"I bought this book to start off with exploring the night sky and thought I would graduate to something more elaborate later.. Few months down, I am still with this book. It's a neat, compact guide (I carry it in my purse) that will help a beginner but also has enough for someone a little more advanced."
2,Not a shining star,"Recognizing this is a $6 ""First Guide,"" overall, it pretty much provides what one would expect: a decent dry survey of constellations, planets, and other astronomical features with some truncated star maps. And it's in a slim handy-to-pocket volume. However, two aspects make this guide subpar, even for the price. First, in a few places they did a poor job of updating the 1988 edition to this 2006 version. For instance, we are told to expect another exciting Leonid meteor shower in 1998 or 1999 (page 62). Second, they should make it clear - on the cover - this guide is geared to the northern latitudes. This little fact is buried in the third paragraph of the introduction."
2,Not for the Southern Hemisphere.,Quite a well thought out book to take around with you.BUT... limited use to me as there are no Southern Hemisphere maps or details (even the Southern Cross is absent).Would not have purchased it had I realised. At least it was cheap!
1,Doesn't have any information,This book doesn't have any information for the dummy in the astronomy. The book is more like a museum guide to the starts. The information on this book is nothing new and it doesn't teach you about telescopes or related topics.
4,fun,"The Cramps are awesome. They have gotten kind of cheesier over the years, but that only makes them more fun. The important thing here is that they rock. This is seriously cool music. There are a couple of songs on the album that are a bit too silly (Stay Sick had the same problem) but overall it is a great rockin listen."
3,I fell in love at a terrible pace,"This is a typical album by the rockabilly influenced punk rock group, or punk influenced rockabilly group, depending how you look at it. It features the usual strange sexual innuendo laden original songs and obscure cover songs (although ""Route 66"" isn't very obscure). This album isn't as good as some of their ""classic"" albums, but their fans should still dig it."
2,"johny heeering, I am a fan, I DIDN""T dig it....","The magic just isn't here anymore. I think that every cramps fiend's affection comes from the fact that these guys struggled through pretty much every kind of hardship a band can face (except for a lack of purpose, drive, and motivation) throughout the wild and wooly days of the early punk scene. even the punks didn't get these guys. This album is just too artificial sounding to be a real cramp's album. it sounds like a novelty album for kids. I loved ""sinners"", though. and for that I gave it another star."
5,Every Smokers need with Newer Cars,"Every Smoker should have at least one of these. New cars don't come with ash trays anymore but they seem to have plenty of cupholders. It slip easily into any cupholder, front, back, or way in the back (for mini vans) where smokers get ban to with an open window. The closing lid helps to extinguish anything not completely put out. The lid prevents spills or messes (when lid is closed) if knocked over. The unit is easy removed to move to another location plus ease of properly disposing of contents. It can be used as a ""stand-alone"" unit so you don't have to look for a place to flick your ash or put out butts. High quality materials used in its costruction and has a nice appearance."
4,Blue Ash Tray for Auto,"Great product - fits nicely in cupholder and is a convenient product for the auto. I would recommend this product for smokers who don't have ashtrays in the car or who just don't want to use their clean new ashtray, like me."
1,Don't waste your time and money,"I bought this because I thought it would keep me entertained at work. It did- for about 5 minutes. The games are VERY easy, I beat them quickly, but you can only play three times a day then you can't collect any more NPs, so there's no point. And you can't manipulate the clock to make the game think it's the next day. I'm just going to keep playing until I can get my rare item code, but I was very disappointed in the game, I thought Neopets could do better."
3,"Really Fun, BUT.....","If your kids like Neopets, they will love these pocket versions of the internet site. BUT. Be aware that these little things take 3 small watch batteries. The one I bought my son ran its batteries down in less than 2 weeks (obviously it had already been played with at the store). Replacement batteries? That's $ in batteries for a $ toy. Better bet is to buy the Meridell or Fairyland sets, which have 3 neopets each, and run on regular AA or AAA batteries (sorry can't remember which). My children now SHARE one of the Meridell sets, and they each use one of the pets included."
3,Pocket Neopet-Kacheek,"If you like kacheek I'll have you know it is an Okay toy ...You take care of the kacheek the kacheek figure is sort of small and if you don't keep it happy and full it will run away so don't buy the food and toys and petpets all at once or it will take forever to restock the food, petpets and toys. To get money you should play games and if you are really good at them you get a trophy.Well I thought this toy was pretty cool...Good Bye!"
2,Neo Pets: Kacheek,"I got this toy for easter. From the comercials I thought the toy would be an action game like a pokemon where it would be in color and I would meet other animals and play with them. But it seemed to be just like those Giga-pets and Tomaguchies. You would get to costomize your pet like what the personality is, but that is the only difference between that and a Giga-pet. The game is completely black and white. One of the things in the game that I didn't like was that you needed to feed your neo pet at certain times of the day and if you feed your neo pet later than that certain time it dies. I would suggest buying it over summer vacation becasue if you don't you'll have to feed it during school."
2,not very useful,"this dictionary is not very good, it is not well written. you ca not find anything on it at all"
1,I never got the book,I was suppose to get my book at the beginning of June and today July 2 I haven't got it. I tracked my order and I found out that it's been already delivered. Where?? I have no idea. I hope somebody can help me. This is not the fist book I bought on Amazon but unfortunately this is the first time I have a problem.Thank you.
1,Diccionario de Los Suenos,The book was in poor quality and looks as if it was stolen from the Villasenor Branch Library. The pages are yellow and dog-eared and has suffered water damage. I will never order a used book again. Very disappointing for the price I paid and the 3 weeks I waited.
1,Kindle version,You cannot search terms.. every time you try using kindle search it brings up on average over 40 pages.This is not worth almost 10dollars for kindle version. Your better off with print. The kindle is not designed to scroll pages quickly say like when your with friends.
3,Un poco de decilusion,el libro es amplio y tiene mucha informacion pero los auguros no se hacen realidad...habia soñado con los numero de la loteria y segui lo que dice el libro hace mas de un año.
4,Fun two-fer for fans,"""Return to Waterloo"" seems something of an indulgence. The mid-life crisis theme is murky but the feeling is unmistakeable. The Ray Davies magic comes through.""Come Dancing"" is a compilation of '80s music videos giving ample evidence that Davies is one of the world's great entertainers.If they're not already in your collection on VHS, you'll want to have this one."
3,Nostalgia piece and dated.,"I'm a huge Kinks/Ray Davies fan and had ""Return to Waterloo"" on vhs with no vhs player. Copy was good, but as I said quite dated. still acceptable for rabid fans like myself."
3,Nice to Look At,"Beautiful photography, but there's not much substance. The potential applications of the included patterns are limited."
3,Mostly grreat ideas but not all are well thought out.,"The book has some really cute, original ideas for children. I was very excited to get started on a project for my daughter. The instructions were very basic and did not include sufficient detail to avoid making mistakes. Also, the project was far too small to turn it inside out without pushing a hole through the fabric. I will most likely stick to embroidered items and will avoid the doll projects in the book."
2,This DVD is mostly NOT what it seems.,"I was excited about this dvd given the quality of other Nova productions but that faded fast once I started watching it. The dvd spends most of the hour on a native Indian and how he uses the art of sand painting to express his view of the world. This was not what I expected. There were parts however, that did get into how the eye works and how there are 4 sections of the brain used for seeing (the 4 parts are form, shape, color, and movement) and somehow the brain presents us with a unified experience of all these processes. Also, how the same neuro-pathways we use for imagining an object and actually seeing it are the same. I really enjoyed those parts yet so much time was spent on the subjective evaluations of how this Indian sees the world that I considered it a waste of time. The ratio was about 20 minutes on vision / brain activity and 40 minutes on this Indian's view of the world. Very disappointing indeed."
4,Not bad at all...,"I was not really sure how this movie was going to play, but it is a thriller and it did keep me on the edge of my seat --- I would probably even watch it a second time --- that's saying a lot for me.BUT, do yourself a favor and buy it used on amazon marketplace or rent it..."
3,ROUTINE DOOMSDAY FLICK,"While I give this movie credit for its quick pacing and not focusing on listless back stories, POLAR STORM doesn't rise beyond its improbable premise. The Aurora Borealis and magnetic pulse waves aren't all that terrifying and even the earthquakes become repetitious. And the resolution the same old thing. Jack Coleman sleepwalks through his role and the ending simply incredulous. It's not awful, just routine."
3,I saw it on tv,"I should have sent it back, but I think I paid right next to nothing for it, so it's not that big of a deal,"
4,I like it so far.....,"I've only been using this product for about two weeks, but so far, so good. The wart is shrinking, so I'll continue using it for several more weeks until I'm sure that it's gone. I like the stick much better than a liquid. It's also less expensive to use than the pads."
2,Ok but did not work all he way,"Just made the wart white, and made the wart smaller, was not impressed. Also this stuff bruses skin so only put on your wart."
1,TERRIBLE!! DOES NOT WORK!!,"Ok this stuff is terrible. These reviews have to be fake. Like other reviewers have noted, because the wart medicine is mixed into the chapstick like material of this stick, it makes it completely useless. Also its hard to really target just the wart since the stick is so big. You are much better off doing what I did and buying Compound W which is a gel and extremely powerful. I'm having much better success with it. You get what you pay for."
2,Counter active,Easy to apply over warts that are bigger than a tiny pad offered by Dr. Scholl's however it seems that it's absorbed by your skin without any effect. I had much much better results with a duck type. Save yourself some money and get liquid form not this vaseline texture product.
5,Painless chapstick for the hand,"It is all in the title. It is nothing more than applying chapstick to the affected area a few times a day. Yes, it may take a few weeks depending on the stage of your wart; however, the painless procedure is worth the results. Plus look at the price! cheapest stuff on the market. No Pain. No Wart. I'll take it!!!"
1,severe allergic reaction,"After using this product for several days on my leg the surrounding skin became incredibly inflamed, almost like a burn. It is extrememly itchy and painful, plus the wart has not gone away the slighest bit."
5,a diamond in the rough!,"great stuff, and to think it's so cheap! i'm unfortunately prone to getting warts on my hands and feet. i've tried everything from store bought remedies to the full grade freezing at the doctor's. nothing worked for either the plantar or the common warts. i eventually got them burned away by laser. that was a pain! plus we're talking about maybe four a year and i don't always have a lot of pocket change to do that. a common wart on my finger was visibly gone within a week but i still used it for some time afterward to make sure the root was gone too. as for some plantar warts on my feet, i can't really comment on because i'm still in the process of removal. the plantar warts must be rooted a lot deeper, but i'm confident this stuff will do the trick. bottom line is this stuff is great! not dangerous at all. use as needed.buy it!"
1,"Doesn't work good, very disapointed",I purchased this product due to all the great reviews. I have used this on my daughters leg for several weeks and still nothing. My daughters leg looks to be rubbed raw but there has been no progress with her warts. I am very disapointed with this medicine!!!
2,not a great product,I did not see any noticable change in my warts. This product is much like chap stick and it will wipe off very easily. I found it very hard to keep on for more than a couple of hours at a time. The only good think about it is it was cheep.
4,"Seriously, work in progress","Okay, so for the skeptics, I will try to keep this short and to the point. I am in the process of using this product. I did not get it from Amazon, I got it at a local CVS. I was looking for the Freeze stuff (I was totally in the dark about wart remover things) and saw that they cost upwards of 16 or more dollars. I decided to go with the stick instead. I have been using it for a few weeks. I applied it to a wart that has been on my finger for a while now, and after maybe a week it started to peel off. I.was.a.mazed. I would rub the edge of the stick around the wart to try to keep it from getting all over my finger (since the wart is fairly small). This has kept the peeling down to a minimum on my good skin. I have let it dry for a while to allow my skin some heal time, but I will continue treatment this week. It really does work (so far, to an extent)."
5,Really effective!,"I highly, highly recommend this product! It removed my wart in two weeks (with less-than-consistent usage). I recommend using the isolation method described in another review as a precaution, but I didn't notice any damage to the skin around my former wart. Also, remember to alternate treatment with airing out (if nothing else, letting the wart dry shows you how the treatment is working)."
1,Completely useless,I used this for a year and a half on a wart on the underside of my big toe. All it did was kill all the healthy skin around it.
2,this takes too long,"this takes too long, you have to apply it all day and that is annoying, get the freeze spray from dr scholes"
5,Wow,"I have tried the wart bandages, the liquid remover as well as the freeze off kinds(do it yourself and at the doctor's office) without any luck getting rid a couple of warts. In a desperate attempt I even took a razor blade and attempted to cut them out. I will never have to try that again. PediFix Wart Stick is amazing. I have not had any issues of redness in the area it's being applied as some of the other reviewers have stated. After using for about 2 weeks, the warts have been shrunken to roughly 1/4 of what they were. I just wish that I had tried this product sooner."
5,I Would Like to Rate 10 Stars to This Product,"This product makes MAGIC!!! My daugther had a wart for more than 2 years n her hand. I used everything I could find over the counter. I brought her 4 times to her Pediatrician to freez it. Nothing worked until I bought this. The first time she used, 70% of the wart was gone. I only used 5 times and now it is 100% gone. I can't be happier and greatful w this product..."
2,Not worth it.,"I had a bunch of plantars warts on my heel that had been there for a while and just kept multiplying. I was under the impression that they had to be removed by a doctor, until I saw this product. I immediately ordered it and began using it religiously. A couple weeks passed and I didn't see a change in the warts. The skin around them wasn't looking so good, but the warts were still thriving. I read online that a lot of people have luck with apple cider vinegar, so I tried that. MUCH better results. Forget this product, just go to the store and get some ACV, cotton balls and duct tape."
2,Did not work after using half the stick,"I spent 3 weeks burning both the warts with wart stick. I used it to the point where it nearly started bleeding, still no result, warts still grew back. Used the freezing method, got rid it of it in one application. Much better, cleaner, and surprisingly, less painful."
5,Works like a charm!,"It's been about a month and my wart is almost gone. It's still visible and I've scratched at it like a scab a couple times, but it definitely works. Great product!"
3,Hmm,I just received it so maybe its too soon to write a review on it but I think that it is better than the liquid and you can apply it anywhere without having to worry about it getting on everything
1,Not a fan of this,This product did not work at all on my son's warts. I was not satisfied with it at all. I would not recommend it.
3,My 4 year old found it painful to walk with this,"It seemed to be working (it was turning the wart white) but it made it painful to walk on after a few days. I had to stop using it on him at this point because he had such a hard time with it. It could be the location of the wart, but he walks fine with other treatments we've tried. I can't mark it 1 star because it did turn it white (which went back to 'normal' within a day of not using this) but not 5 since it was so painful for him. Thought I'd mention our experience in case you have a kiddo to put it on."
5,This stuff REALLY works!,"I had a stubborn wart on my finger, and I tried everything to make it go away. I tried Compound W Wart Remover bandages, and though I thought my wart was completely removed, it returned a few weeks later. I found this product upon searching for wart remover, and I was desperate, so I just went ahead and tried it.Because it is a stick solid, it is easy to apply exactly where it is needed, instead of using a bandage with a pre-applied remover compound. It took only a few weeks for my wart to be completely deadened, and now you can't even tell that I used to have a terrible wart on my thumb. This product is great!!!!"
5,Best product w/o precription,"Way better than most other over the counter products. 40% rather than the typical 17% salicylic acid. And in a semi-dry form which can be used later if needed unlike the liquid products that become useless after opening the container a few times. Very effective even on the stubborn issues. ""I didn't really want to write a review on this, but we all have problems from time to time, so I hope this helps."""
5,Consistent use - dermatologist recommended,"My son had two plantar warts on his foot. Went to the dermatologist. She froze one, but the other was not a candidate for freezing (since it was right where he puts pressure when he walks, she doesn't freeze those types to avoid the chance of a scar, and said it could feel like he was walking on a pebble for the rest of his life if it scarred). She sent us home with a Wart Stick. Name sounded hoakey, but we used it. She said it will work, but the problem people have is not using it each and every day. We made it a routine and didn't miss but maybe 1-2 nights over three months and they are gone now. It's painless and odorless, no mess, quick, no big deal. Set it by your bed and make it a routine. You'll be happy you did. It was an interesting progression watching those gross things die. It was about $7. Saves you the expense of a doctor's visit."
2,Didn't get the job done,"I ordered it for a wart on my knee. Although I did see it begin to work by turning the wart black, this was a very thin layer. After the thin layer turned black and fell off I began the process again. Again, (2 weeks later) a thin layer turned black. I used this wart stick for almost 2 months before I grew sick of it's results and went to the doctor to have it frozen off."
2,Easy to use but does it work?,"This product is like chapstick. It goes on so easy. It doesn't damage nearby skin at all. You don't have to be careful with it. I have been using it for a few days, that's all. I would be amazed if it actually does anything. If it does I will come back here and say so. It seems like chapstick. So far, nothing at all."
3,takes too long to work,"This is a good product, staying in place because it's like vaseline, however expect several months before you would get rid of your wart with this. It's peels your skin and you can feel the tingling when applied, your skin to peel within couple of days if follow directions. Then a light scrubbing. But what I found out works quicker is to cut a thin slice to lime and rub in on the wart and using the lime skin as exfolient. Because what a wart is is that it lives on the top layer of the skin forming a skin matrix (due to abnormal growth). So basically this medicine intended to gently wear down the matrix gradually, but I didnt have time. I wanted it gone and quick, so the lime works from just two days to use, though I did draw blood breaking down the food supply of the wart (capillaries)."
2,PediFix Wart Stick wasn't very effective.,Am giving this product only 2 stars because it didn't seem to have an effect other than irritating my skin.
5,Succeeded Where Other Products Did Not!,"My dermatologist had frozen off the warts on one of my toes before, but they came back multiple times. I had tried the do-it-yourself freeze off products, too. Nothing worked long-term until I tried the wart stick. It's very important to apply the product to the wart and ONLY the wart. Getting the product on skin around the wart will lead to irritated skin...My only other advice is to apply the wart stick as directed. I used it every morning until my warts went away. They're still gone six months later!"
5,Fast acting!,"I ordered a two-pack of this item since my 13 year old daughter had a wart on her finger. When I first read in the directions that it may take up to 12 weeks of use, I was thinking a trip to the doctor's office might be a quicker solution. We gave it a try anyway applying it twice a day and covering the area with a band-aid; her wart practically disappeared within 5 days. Great little product and does what it promises."
4,Works!,Worked in just a few days on simple warts and is working on plantar warts. Easy to apply. Shipped fast and affordable.
1,Didn't work,This didn't work for me. But then neither did freezing or medicated tape. So it may or may not work for you.Other than that the biggest negative is that this looks too much like chapstick. It should have been designed to look different so that children don't apply it accidentally.
5,"Clean application, more potent than popular OTC products.","I like the clean applicator of this medication, rather than the gels/liquids which tend to get gunky quickly. The only drawback is that it appears like a lip balm, so you'll want to keep it kept away safely for young ones and make mention to others who don't look closely at labels. I also like that the percentage of the active ingredient is much higher than other brands. We've only been using it a five days and we're quickly seeing the efficacy of this product."
2,Just get the real deal. Dr scholls. This doesn't work.,A waste of time and money. Didn't do anything for me. Just pay an extra $10 and get dr. Scholls wart freezer
1,This product takes forever to work!,I have used this product for two weeks and wasted so many band aids. There is so little improvement that it is not worth buying this product. BEWARE
1,Don't waste your money!,"I wish I could give this product no stars.I bought this stuff from a local health store and used it as directed. The product boasts a higher content of salicylic acid than other products. When I applied the product I was expecting it to burn. However, I never felt a thing. It's doesn't go on very smooth either (it's not like lip balm) and seems to cake up. I used it for 2 months and the wart actually got a little bigger. I saw no noticeable change other than that. It was a waste of money for me. When I went back to the health store to tell the guy about the product, they had already stopped selling it because of complaints of it not working. Oh well."
5,"Worked, when others didn't!","Edit* Sorry I wrote this while I was a little excited the first time so let me reword it.Anyways. I had tried many other products to remove a wart that was growing on my thumb in a place that was very noticeable. I couldn't even caress my fiances skin without bothering her with it's roughness. This worked when others didn't. It was funny since I had tried everything from burning the wart off to cutting it off and then burning the wound, so that the wart wouldn't come back. That was after I tried too many over the counter meds that didn't work. This worked for me an it might for you. It's awesome that the wart fell off with this product, after it had regrown back so many times in that same year!PS. I mostly used it 3-4 times a day and covered the spot with duct tape, every time.Be careful though, it looks just like chapstik. Your kids might put this in their mouth thinking it is!"
3,Convenient Product,"I bought this product primarily for the price and the concentration of Salicylic acid. It has proved to be very convenient as well.Pros - Superior convenience, seems to be effectiveCons - The stick is a bit too thick and needs to be rubbed onto the skin a few times to get an adequate quantity out."
4,Seems to be working so far,I've been using it for about 3 weeks and haven't been very good at remembering to apply it every day but it seems to be working. I'm sure it would work better if I were more consistent.
1,slimcook,This had no impact whatsoever on my warts. I was concerned that one of my children would think it was lip balm and accidentally use it on their lips...this didn't happen but I even if it had it certainly wouldn't have hurt as it seemed like wax.
2,JUST LIKE ANY OTHER,"THIS PRODUCT IS CONVENIENT BUT ITS ALSO THE SAME AS ANY OTHER PRODUCT I HAVE USED. EVEN THOUGH EVERYBODY'S BODY ACTS DIFFERENT, THIS WORKS THE SAME AS THE LIQUID FOR ME."
4,Short But To-The-Point,"Very well done. I've been hoping for years that someone would work on documenting motion for artists, and this begins to fit the need. It's short, and it could have offered much more, but it is worth the money."
2,Hmmm...Smells Different,"So when I orginally purchased this item in store, I feel in love with the scent. So upon running out of my perfume I was destined to find the scent online and replace it. But after ordering it and wearing it a couple of times, I realized the smell from this scent was a tad-who am I kidding, wayyyy different from the scent that I smelled in the store. Sorry, but I just don't believe this is the same With Love scent I purchase. Smelled like a cheap attempt to manufacture the real thing -__-"
2,With Love by Hilary Duff,"This product was delivered promptly and efficiently within three days of ordering it.Don't like the scent anymore however, I don't know if I have changed or if it is an old batch."
3,Beautiful Costumes,"I bought this DVD just to look at and get ideas for costume making - and this DVD is a great inspiration for that as it has a section set aside for costume making. Sarah's costumes are gorgeous - aaah those skirts - I want them! As I am sure you will too.The choreographies are ok, but I will change them a little to suit my own style, I like the music Sarah used. And as a drummer (Drummer/Dancer) I found myself watching and listening to the drummers instead of watching Sarah dance. I may have to go back later and watch Sarah (sorry Sarah) ha ha. But I found it useful as i was able to play along with the drummers.But all in all - I would recommend this DVD for those of you who are as mad on dancing and drumming as I am. And it is reasonably priced."
5,fun for beginners,This is a really fun dvd for beginning dancers. Sarah teaches two very cute dances and her instruction is easy to follow. The section on costuming alone makes this dvd worth the price!
2,hmmm,"I like Sarah. I like her way of speaking, I enjoy how expressive she is, and how charming she is. I enjoyed looking at her costumes in this dvd and will be in my sewing room trying to recreate the sparkly belts she was showing us. The choreographies are good for beggining belly dancers. I was hoping for a break down of the Turkish dance style here, but there were only two choreographies. No real explanation of Turkish or the raw elements that can be used outside of those choreographies. But I can't get over what a good speaker Sarah is and how fun she is to watch and listen to."
5,Full of life,The Turkish Belly dancing is creative and warm. It is like the Arabic belly dancing but has more charm. Sarah Skinner gives you a good idea about the choregraphy and magic of this great art and style.
5,Sultry Sarah's belly dance,"I really enjoyed this DVD! Sarah does a lovely job teaching two different choreographies and performing them beforehand. I met her in Dayton, OH last year and was very impressed with her dancing and personality."
3,Okay looking for other Turkish Dance,I should have known this was not what I wanted. Sorry an advanced dancer so the moves were way to simple. Okay for begginners that are looking for a taste of the dance as need is there but no teachers or no chance to get in a class. I have over 13 DVDS to have mastered Egyption belly dance as I am trying to master other versions. Those striking out to learn on their own I commend you as just keep the info you gather as the building blocks of your dance.
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"I am writing this review because I don't want another person to read the editor's reviews and believe that this CD is anything but garbage. I am a huge fan of Dirty Vegas, but by far, this is not their best effort. In fact, it took no effort on their part at all. They put a couple of songs from the 80's and 90's and compiled them on one CD. There wasn't any great beats, vocal overlays, or anything to speak of that would have made this CD unique. I could have made this CD at home on my computer and ""mixed"" it better than this. Please, if you value your money spend it on something else. Let this CD go to the wayside. You will be better for it. I ended up giving my copy away!"
4,These are songs that are surprising fun,"Think of this as a playlist for an ipod, not a remix album. This is an effort by the band to turn people on to songs that wouldn't necessarily be on your list of dance party tunes; but trust me, at 4 a.m. you'll be singing along at the top of your lungs."
5,WONDERFUL BOOK,This book is great. The author makes you feel as if you are the heroine of this book. You live and breathe what she goes through. I love when an author sticks to the actually history of the era and does not make things up. Anyway this book was a great read if you like history and love real romance.
4,Slow Moving,"I did enjoy this book, but it was very slow moving. It reminded me of a Regency Novel set in America.I didn't feel the description was very accurate, but it was well written and interesting.Personally, I thought Gordon was sort of a jerk."
3,mixed bag,"This is an interesting story set at the UN headquarters. Creative plot with plausible yet surprising twists, and a peek into a place few have experience with. The downside is the style. It's all written in 1st person narrative, which is ok, but Sutherland writes the whole story in the present tense (with a few exceptions, which I assume are oversights). One has the sense that it was a 9th grade English assignment to have a whole story written in present tense to teach the kids about tense, or maybe it was done on a dare. In any case, it was very annoying, and I would have put it down early on if the story wasn't so interesting."
1,Rates Minus Stars,"This is a supposed ""thriller"" that is actually a dull, dialogue ridden yawner with little action and uninteresting characters. The ""mystery"" involved is psuedo-solved in a very unsatisfiying way and the reason behind the murder involved is (to say the least) contrived. I read the descriptions on every box and bag in my cupboard before I resorted to complete the reading of this book. I held out a very small hope that its ""resolution"" might be in some way satisfying. My hopes were crushed. I will avoid this author at all cost in the future."
3,The only Maxted book I found Unworthy,"If you have a love life, don't bother; however, if you are still in search of a good one, go for it."
5,Better explainations...,I have 3 books with PHP and MySql in the cover.Topic by topic I prefer this book's explanations because they are more in depth and more logically developed.
2,Not a book for beginners,"I bought this book for my first PHP college class. I had only dabbled in PHP, so I was in no way ready for this book. While the book is very large, it fails to go indepth for explanations. I tend to learn well by a book staying with a program and going through into detail what to do and then expanding on that program throughout. This book is only useful for referencing."
5,I love this book!,"The author covers a great deal on commands and syntax, but the true strength of this title lies in its ability impart an understanding of the logic and numerous concepts behind PHP/MySQL development. I would most recommend this book to those individuals who are comfortable with HTML and CSS, and have at least minimal programming experience. Sharp and dedicated ""no-experience"" beginners could probably figure things out as they go along, but it would require some effort. I personally think that's a fair trade for a book that will prove itself invaluable to anyone seriously interested in learning PHP/MySQL development."
5,It's Just Perfect!!!!!!!!,This book is perfect in every way. I won many singing and instrumental competition because of this book. It's chords are accurate in all of the notes. Thanks The Corrs for the book. You guys always rule!!!!!!
5,Roots Rock Paper Scissors - A Hit!,"This record is a great example of what roots rock is supposed to be. There is a variety of music on this record from lap steel guitar to electric fiddle - all pleasing to the soul. This is the best of the seven records this group has produced yet. The variety, good rhythm, and sensational lyrics are what make this record great. This includes members of the Bruce Hornsby Band on vocals, organ, and saxophone. This record is excellent and is worth every penny."
4,Momentum watch,I like this watch. It's brightly colored so easy to keep track of when you take it off. I like the strap design as it helps keep it on with accidental bumping while taking on and off dive equipment. The strap can then be changed to a different set up to accommodate non-diving wear. Very versatile. It is also reasonably easy to set it.
3,"Hamfisted and too long, even at ~150 pages","Erewhon, like Butler's other (magnificient and far more effective) novel The Way of All Flesh, is rife with social satire. The optimistic and devout explorer trots out all kinds of European imperialist platitudes and, as with most satirical characters, is almost totally one-dimensional. Most other characters- noble savages, squaws, and other racist or bigoted archetypes, are fodder for the author's wit more than flesh and blood. This would be fine if the satire were as proficient as, say, Voltaire's, but it is not.As others have mentioned, the ""justice"" system in Erewhon whereby the sick are punished and criminals rehabilitated to health is the main punchline. In a short story this concept would have been brilliant but the length of the book grinds the joke into the ground well before the narrative draws to a close. It's a joke with a punchline that doesn't justify the extravagant buildup."
3,better in concept than execution..,"'Erewhon' has all the makings of a great book. Written during the stifling Victorian era, 'Erewhon' is about a fictitious land where society and government behave in ways counter to (the then) modern thinking. For example, machinery of nearly all form is viewed with contempt. And being physically sick is a criminal offense. Etcetera, etcetera. Too bad this 'Brave New World' predecessor wasn't produced by a more a capable writer.So what is wrong with 'Erewhon'? For starters, almost no effort is spent on character development. The leading character, who narrates 'Erewhon', is a young British man .. and that's the extent we know of him. And there is scant plot development. After our young Brit finds himself in Erewhon he really doesn't do much other than lecture the reader on the odd Erewhonian customs. After a short while it gets a bit boring. Mercifully, 'Erewhon' is a short novel.Bottom line: its creative premise is wasted by poor writing. A miss."
2,Very Out-of-date in most respects,"It is interesting to read the ""Terminator-esque"" fears of 19th century scholar/writers like Butler. Unfortunately, in the face of today's depleted oil supplies, such fears of machines taking over society may be a bit out of date. At any rate, what surely is out of date is Butler's writing style, which is all ""tell"" and no ""show""--the complete opposite of, and in this case vastly inferior to, the Hemingway style of the 20th century. There is only a thin veneer of story here, a thin and slight excuse of a story and then Butler hits us with page after page of philosophical dystopian diatribe. Orwell may have learned a lot from this book which helped him write the masterpiece ""1984"", but Orwell did it much, much better. Orwell's story, as well as his dystopian diatribe, were much, much sounder and more described and more plausible."
2,Dreary and ponderous text makes for a dull read,"This book was originally published in 1975 and boy does it feel its age. The writing is dull, flat and mindlessly repetitive. Reading it feels like a flat-footed ""Dick and Jane"" story with corns and bunions to boot. I probably should cut this book some slack because the author was probably trying to follow some educational theory of the time where children learn best to read if the text is ""X"". All I can say is ""Humph!"" Reading this little gem aloud for the first time to my little four-year-old, I had to heavily revise the text on the fly to make it even halfway listenable. The two stars comes from the drawing of birds. My little guy loves birds and loved looking at the pictures. He recognized some of the birds from our backyard. I've seen better birding books for the little ones."
5,Human Landscapes of a Nation,"Nazim Hikmet's great Epic Poetry is written in simple lines that carry more than they seem. So much about a culture and its human side. Nazim Hikmet, regardless of his politic side, is a humanist that always believed in human beings and wished for the best for those who suffer. Human Landscapes is a masterpiece of his humanist side."
4,Almost there,"This is a great series, but like most anime, builds to climax near the end of the series. In this DVD there is some action but as usual, not all of the characters have shown themselves yet. So the final battle is not till much later in the series. this dvd still has fighting in it, but you might want to watch the later ones to see the better battles. its a great series and u should watch all the way through in order to get the full effect."
2,disapointment in Belgistan,"After purchasing the first in this series of DVDs, I was eagerly awaiting the next one in the series. However I was disapointed in this vid. Their were less episodes on this disk than the first one and fewer extras. I will admit that the story is still excellent, although frustrating at times, and the animation is superb. ... I would rather buy the Robotech legacy DVD or even Fight Club instead of this vid.Sincerely:David C. Eberhart II"
2,I give it a full two stars because of the great artwork.,"It offers nothing but mystery. The first volume was left me a bit clueless. I had bought this hoping it would answer some of the questions of the first volume, like what is up with the ceremony, the main charector or even what does the TA's have to do with any of this. It appears to be extremely slow. So far there is nothing much more than talking with a little bit of action in the 2 DVDs. It makes it seem like you need to buy the next DVD for the answers, but they do not give enough episodes per DVD for price and I usually do not buy any more of a series if I did not enjoy the first few episodes, more of less the first 7. This DVD make me feel like I would be wasting money if I were to finish the series. I recommend watching one of the Gundam series, at least that might offer more action, plot or even comedy."
3,"Was on a MUST SEE list, so I watched it.","Not a bad movie. In all, I enjoyed it. Not action packed, no big explosions :) Not sure that I would classify it as a MUST SEE, but I don't regret watching it."
4,"But, oh, the acting!","Yes, this is a confusing film in many ways. I'll admit straight off that I am not a Godard film; he lost me completely in his 60's ""Socialist"" period, but his films were never much on plot or continuity. What makes A Bout de Souffle/Breathless worth seeing is two-fold: Jean-Paul Belmondo and Jean Seberg. They are excellent in working with sometimes-confusing material and I do not believe that many other actors could have pulled this off."
5,Greay Buy,"I have a soft spot for any criterion collection DVDs and Breathless surely delivers. The feature film alone would be worth the price, in my opinion. But the special features and the small book with how Goddard viewed his film after its release are what made this purchase so special for me. Although the film was revolutionary for its time, the modern movie goer might be a little bored. Any student of film or the average francophile will fall in love with this piece of cinema history."
2,I never got what Picasso's paintings meant either.,"What is french for dribble???The editing of this film must have been done by either a blind man or a chimpanzee suffering from attention deficite disorder. The difference between ""art"" and a movie, art is for the critics to give arwards to and movies are for ""common people"" like me to enjoy....."
5,DVD edition will be available soon!,"This is a great movie,and it was one of the movies which heralded the arrival of ""NOUVELLE VAGUE"" which used ""jump cuts""(Godard used the skill in ""A bout de souffle""),""location shooting"", ""improvised dialogue"". Moreover,he used ""long shots"",so the movie was experimental,and it is still enjoyable now. The story of the movie is still interesting,and see the final scene. I hope DVD edition which will be released on Oct 9 by a notorious studio ""Fox Lorber"" will be a great edition."
3,Ok,"It's an ok film. I liked Contempt better althought breathless is mentioned as one of the great films ever made. I understand that it was an important movie that deviated from the conventional style back then and and it was an early new-wave movie after the 400 blows. I get all the points godard tries to make in this movie. Like emphasizing on unnecessary details(the chat on the street, in the bedroom) and cutting short major events(killing the cop). But at the end of the day I was not very impressed, the movie didn't catch my attention. On the other hand the 30 minute sequence in the apartment between bridget bardot and ger husband in Contempt was intruging, complex and masterful."
3,"Good film, dodgy DVD","The film is beautifully restored. But the commentary by an American 'film expert' is unbelievably annoying - the man clearly has a turnip for a brain, and spouts endless slack-jawed drivel about how the film is just a harmless piece of jolly French fun with nothing profound in it. Give me a break."
4,"Youth, where are thou ?","Even though this movie is pivotal, and reflects a time long gone, even though the acting is great, I'm somewhat disappointed...it has aged!"
2,What an annoying movie,"I guess those who enjoy movies from a box-seat of film-critiques find this movie superb, and I kind of get their points. It's a classic in its theme, content and emphasis on the story. But acting itself was centered on one person--the male protagonist. The female character was lacking in her skill as an actress. Also I find it annoying the way most French movies keep ranting about love. Give me a break! Love this, love that, yak yak, dreamy intellectualism and what not. I suggest you pass, unless this is a required movie for your Film 101 class."
4,Well worth the re-print,"Reprinted by a British firm that specializes in such things, this is a well-written, well-researched book on the Strauss family and other contemporary musician-conductors. Without being pedantic, it provides pertinent [sometimes little-known] facts in a reader-friendly fashion. I hadn't known until recently, for example, that performances of the Waltz King's waltzes and polkas are based on orchestral arrangements of 1- or 2-piano reductions--all the original orchestrations having been lost for years. The only clue that one is reading a high-quality photocopy-based reprint are the very rare check marks and other marginalia that someone forgot to expunge before the copying was done. Well worth the price."
1,british and boring,"first of all, this is a book written by a british author for british women. i could understand most of the quips in the book, but not all of them.then all the advise. some good (and primitive), some not so good (unless you have the personality of joan rivers).i didn't like this book at all, but i thought i would give it a chance after reading the prequel."
2,Henny Youngman,He is much funnier to watch in old clips than it is to read the book. I guess it loses something in the translation.
4,Greetings Authors and Illustrators,"Meet The Authors and Illustrators IIThe book Meet The Authors and Illustrators is a book about writer's and illustrator's lives. This book tells you if they had any trouble writing their books, or drawing the pictures for the books. A good feature of this book is that it shows a picture of the author or illustrator. Adults and children will enjoy reading these authors' stories. I have no dislikes about it. I recommend this book to all readers. A good way to learn fun and interesting facts about your favorite authors and illustrators is to get a copy of this book and indulge in its text."
5,Great Bible,"This Bible is great! Great translation and good size. It's not a pocket Bible, but it's not a giant book, either. It's more like a regular-sized softcover book. And the new chapter introductions are really nice, very informative and useful."
5,perfect,This came exactly the way it was displayed and described online. Convenient for everyday study use as well as taking it out with me. Pretty on the outside and even prettier on the inside because it shows me the Word. The minimal footnotes at the bottom of each page are sufficient.
4,"Whose Life IS it, anyway?","This play presents an amazing debate on personal autonomy -- our right to do what we will with our own lives. A woman who has felt abandoned, ignored, physically ill and of no particular use to herself or her family spends one last night with her elderly mother as she prepares to kill herself. Her mother tries every method from begging to logic to humor in order to to try to get her to change her mind.The play, presented in real-time, is gripping. Norman is a powerful writer. She creates great, flawed characters and places them in a fishbowl for us to watch as they swim in circles around an issue no one really wants to talk about -- suicide. This play is sure to spark some great discussions, which is what powerful literature ought to do."
5,Know exactly where to place your shot,"I have used this book on helping 1st time hunters on elk, and bison make the shot that will cleanly take the animal. It shows both external and internal views so that you can understand why and where to place your shot. A must have for new and old hunters that want that one shot one kill record."
5,Must Read,For anybody who is presently hunting big game and all those who are thinking about it should make this book a must read. It really helps you to understand the anatomy of the animals you are hunting and prepares you to make more of your shots Kill Shots. Excellent reading.
3,Not sure if this is same version? Different Box,"The one I have, I like the first story best with Denise Crosby from Star Trek Next Generation. She plays a psychiatrist and mimics her patient's wild adventure, except she is better. It is called The Psychiatrist. The next one is called Four on the Floor like the title, it is sexy, but as the other reviewer stated these are soft porn. The last one is Emily's Dance, it is really sexy dancing. The first story is the best. I was going to put it up for sale here, but since it has a different box, I will put it up in auctions with a picture."
4,Four friends...four pleasures,"Sharing thoughts, dances, and dining together was only the four-play. They shared something that only very close friends should ever share...and that night brought them closer together. Very sensual, very sexy...and a lot of fun. If you like RSD's, this is a good one for your colleciton. Terry is calling me to the bedroom...she just put in another RSD for a fun-filled Friday night...lucky me.Terry...I'll be coming shortly"
3,I think Jason is awesome,"Jason has that rare sense of humor that does see the absurd in everything, it's a quality to be admired. He's funny smart and can tell a story unlike anyone else. I was a little disappointed in the book though. It was stripped naked compared the blog. Though I loved the first few pages. Who would have thought?? After having read the blog I couldn't help but feel like I was constantly missing something while reading the book. I think we all were spoiled by reading the blog. I heard there is movie deal in the works. I can't even picture how they would make that work. Would it be half real and half fiction?? Or would he just ad more of the orginal story of being there. Either way Jason should be proud. He did a great job."
3,So much potential,This toy would be a lot more fun if it wouldn't tip over so easily or collapse. My son still tries to play in it even when it tips over.
2,BALLS EVERYWHERE!,We live in AK and so we thought we needed to find something to keep our toddler active while being cooped up during the winter. Our son loves it...WE HATE IT! It takes up almost the whole living room...that's not the bad part! There is only a bottom in the Large section. The two medium section are open on the bottom so there are always balls everywhere! We bought extra balls (which you need) but our house turns into a ball pit! But we make it a game with our toddler to pick up the balls...but WARNING you will be finding balls for days!
5,A lot of Bang for the Buck,Our play hut arrived recently and we haven't been able to get my toddler out of it! For $50 (plus shipping) this set is a BARGAIN! It is super easy to set up and break down and is versatile given the many options for setting it up (some or all of the pieces). I didn't realize the balls were included with the tent and tunnels but my daughter enjoys them most of all! Can't recoommend this item any higher- lots of bang for the buck!
3,Fun but HUGE,"This is a great toy. Santa brought it for our 2 year old. Problem- It is so big it takes up our whole NYC apartment. Problem 2- it is near impossible to fold. Other issue is it doesn't come with that many balls.If you have a house w/ a playroom, buy this thing. It'll last for ever and the kids will have fun."
3,Must have lots of room,I got this Megaland for my 2 year old. First off I didn't realize how big it is. If I put the whole thing together it takes up a huge portion of my living room. I usually only put up one part at a time. It comes with two tunnels and three play huts. The balls that come with the color does rub off. My daughter's socks turned pink. I bought a pack of 100 extra play balls off amazon. They are huge and the color doesn't come off. The balls that come with the megaland are tiny and 100 of them come with the megaland and it covers one corner pretty much of the tent for balls. When I set up the big ball tent my daughter pushes it over and sits on it and of course it collapses easy.Easy to pop open not easy to curl back up and put in carry bag. I just fold and stick behind the couch.
2,NOT what described,"I bought this toy for my 1 year old. When I first got the package, I noticed that the plastic covering was torn. This should have been my first clue. The product was NOT what the picture is. Infact, it's a cheaper one that costs 10$ less. I got the Mega 2 play land. I found it at Toys R US for 47$. The balls that were supposed to come with the play set were opened and had hair on them. The set is flimsy, attaches cheaply, and falls over very easily. Without the addition of the balls, I set it up and my 1 year old loved it. I determined that I was going to get a different brand all together because I was unhappy with the order. The balls, besides used already, were very cheap and squished easily. Overall this product sucks. I'm sending it back tomorrow ( i got it today). I will be ordering a different brand all together from Toys R Us. The tunnels don't even connect right...there are big holes where they attach. disappointed....."
4,A Lot For The Money,"This is easy to set up and surprisingly a large once it is. We bought it for our 2 year old and he loves it. Our 5 year old fits just fine too. I would suggest that you pick up extra 'Fun Balls' the ones that come with it are small diameter and don't really add up to much fun. I purchased 150 3"" balls and that fills the floor of the main chamber nicely. Double that and it would be more like a ball pit that your kids can really sink into."
4,Good Toy,My son loves this playhouse. He was only 12 months when we got this for him and loves going in and out of the house. the only thing i dont like about this item is that its easily knocked down by son. he leans on item and its always tipping over. i have to put heavy blankets to keep it up.its a great playhouse. spends lots of time in it! It also needs more balls. 50 balls is not enough it looks empty!!! if you get this make sure to buy the 150 count of balls to go along with it!
4,Mega Playland,"I purchased this as a gift for my grandson's 2nd birthday, knowing that his 4year old brother would be playing with it just as much, so needed something that was big enough to share without causing conflict. The main reason for this particular type of pop-up tent was just that, it pops up. We've had the ones with the poles before and they are such a nuisance to assemble and take apart. These 5 pieces went up in about 8 minutes and were taken down in about 5, you cannot ask more than that. We'll have to see how long they all last, but so far, both boys are having a great time sinking basketballs and pretending whatever it is they pretend. If it lasts just the one season, I'll be happy, everything else is gravy."
4,My boys love it!,"I was not so excited about the price but the good reviews on Amazon convinced me to purchase it for my boys. They are 1 and 2. They love it! This set is HUGE. Make sure you have space in your home for something like this. We put it between our two sofas in the living room for now. We plan to move it to their playroom as soon as we do some rearranging in there. The boys have knocked it down playing rough inside the hut. It just pops right back. The setup was super easy. If you don't have a room big enough for the entire play hut then it can easily be setup into two smaller units that are still fun. Great buy. I wished I would have discovered this sooner. This would have really helped out during our snow days and just really cold days when we just didn't leave the house. Also, I plan to take some parts of this unit when we travel this summer."
5,Keeps my little one entertained,This house is bigger than i thought it was going to be. it keeps my child entertained for long periods of time. this product came with a few plastic balls but not nearly enough to fill the main hut. i suggest you purchase an extra bag here or at your local wal mart. Overall i love it (not nearly as my daughter does)and i do not regret my decision in buying this product since it keeps the little one busy.
4,Baby has fun but not sturdy,"Bought this for my son's 1st birthday; he and his cat love to play in it and knock it over while crawling up the sides. More than once the cat and my son have gotten ""stuck"" in the ball toss holes but it was too serious to cause me worries. I didn't hook the entire structure together as it is too big for my office but if you are using it outside you should be fine. In the ball pit part, I can't imagine more than two children being able to play at once. The balls don't stay in the ball pit due to the shallow ""walls"". For us the number that came with was just right since they end up every but in the ball pit.I don't expect it to last more than a year (if I'm lucky two) with how rough they are on it. I'm already seeing fraying and string and it's bent out of shape from being knocked over and jumped on from all directions.Overall, for fun 5 stars but quality only 2.5 stars. (Please keep in it was up everyday and they had access to playing in it all day long)."
2,"Great fun, poor quality","I really wanted to love this product. My twins have a lot of fun for a couple of weeks, it is now broken at the seems and I don't know if we can fix it or if there is a guarantee."
4,The gift that can keep on giving....,"I believe that I bought this one nearly two years ago and my now 3 year-old son still makes me pull it out of the closet for him to play with. It's not a bad buy even if you have limited room because kids love enclosed areas for some reason and it'll keep them occupied for hours-especially if they have friends over. I have trouble quantiying the educational value of this toy, but I will say that it helped him to trust me even more when I would convince him to go in one end and then I would be at the other end to greet him. It's a solid investment that I wished I had the pleasure of enjoying when I was his age...."
5,wow.......,"very nice tent, that my twin sons always want to play hide and seek with me. they really like to go in and come out of the tent through tunnels. definitely, the ball, that come with this tent are not at all sufficient. and also, we need to be careful, with the kids who are very rash. they can easily drag it. only for the large tent, the bottom has a base. other has empty space on the base. so its not suitable for out doors. but we can use it on the grass or indoors. its suitable for both boys and girls. kids will enjoy when their friends come to play with them. but the price is definitely not resonable.. its very costly compared to other malls"
3,"Great FUn, but Cheap construction for the price.","Just got this the other day for my nephew... he just turned 1 & loves it! He barily played in it & the 2nd time it was opened we noticed a seem on the lrg tent was ripped already & the metal was hanging out! Then upon more inspection the seem construction is pretty shotty & soon more seems will be open. 50 balls is definatly not enough.. bought him more before he even got this toy,because i read a previous review.. going to contact amazon about it already being ripped & see what they say. I only gave this product a 3 due to construction, but my nephew LOVES it & so does my 7mo old daughter when she plays in it with him.."
3,"Great Idea, OK design","Each piece springs open quickly & easily , but the connections between the cubes and tunnels are flimsy. Attached only with velcro through loops which can come undone and also leave gaps big enough for balls to escape. If you get more balls for the ball pit than the 50 provided, they will not stay in the ball area because the ball pit only zips on one side. My 2 year old seems to like it, but I spend a lot of time picking up stray balls and turning the whole thing upright when he easily tips it over."
2,reneeaggie98,"This is not my favorite toy! The most annoying part is the fact that it is large and hard to put away. The directions for how to fold it back up are not well written and I guarantee no one is smiling like the lady in the picture when try to put this thing back in it's storage bag! And after a few times of storing it, now it won't pop back up correctly and can't stand on it's own. The next thing is that the balls get EVERYWHERE. I find them for days after we use this toy. The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is that my two year really does like playing in it despite the fact it is so warped the tunnels don't even attach anymore."
3,Not for us.,"My son was very interested when I first unpacked it but once I walked away, he had no interest in it at all. I thought he would have loved it because he likes to climb on, around and under things but this was a no go for him. He may have grown to love it but I had to return it because it was bigger than I thought and we don't have room to spare. If you do buy this item, make sure you have plenty of room to set it up. We only had it a few days.I went out and bought a tunnel instead. That is much easier to setup and take down and it doesn't take up as much room."
3,Disappointment,I have this in my daycare for yrs. None of my daycare kids really play with it for long. The fun my might on a good day last 30 minutes. And that rare. I don't put it up often because of it.
4,One Year Old Present To Grow Into,"We gave the Megaland Playhut to our one year old on his birthday, he is a little young for it, but we beleive it is the type of thing he can grow into and play with for a long time. We are very impressed with the quality, craftsmanship, and ingenuity of the design. The tunnel system does not feel claustrophobic because they have included cutouts with screens so you can see thru a space and other cutouts that are open. This also allows parents to check up on the child's activities. The only thing we have noticed,it has only been two weeks,if it is windy outside, the Playhut can blow over on it's side."
4,The only thing needed for this purchase is creativity,"The Megaland by Playhut is excellent for little folks. It is durable and can take the wear and tear of cowboy and indians, space adventures to the princess in the castle. It has been turned over, stepped on, kicked, pushed around the floor and sat on by my year old son. My five year old and 3 year old have taken it a step further than the baby by making this playland their make-believe area. The balls are awesome because I get to keep them clean and they are very safe. It has been great for rainy days or when we can't get to the park. I have different pieces in different rooms. Since you can add on pieces I am going to invest in more tunnels. But you definately need a big play area when the entire megaland is set up."
3,"Fun, but potentially dangerous - reported to CPSC","Megaland is indeed a lot of fun. Our 12 month-old twins absolutely love it, and we always find new ways to play with it. However, be careful. With rough play the metal strips can separate and cause a severe injury. Below is the text of a recent complaint I made to the CPSC:Megaland by Playhut is a collection of three pop-up tents and 2 pop-up tunnels. The strips of flexible metal used to give the objects their shape and pop-up nature can separate, leaving two very sharp ends that could easily cause a laceration or severe eye injury. Both of our tunnels broke in this way, and the ends of the metal strips pierced the fabric covering. Fortunately, we noticed this in time and threw them both away before any harm could ensue. My guess is that this only occurs with rough play (e.g., children jumping on the tunnels and compressing the strips); however, the fact is that children play rough, and our tunnels broke after only two weeks."
1,Flimsy waste of money,"This is the worst toy in the world. Our daughters got it on Christmas and it is the 31st of December and it's laying dead and deflated in our living room. All they need to do is press on the walls and the whole thing flips over. The tunnels become disconnected constantly. We invested in the 100 balls which are now all over the house b/c with the exception of the main hut, the two connecting rooms have no floor to contain the balls. Total disappointment."
4,Huge Fan!,My kids age 2 & 4 absolutely love this! It's not bottom heavy so they can easily tip it over while jumping around the inside but so far we haven't had any serious accidents. The balls that come with it really aren't enough to fill enough the ball pit area but that is perfectly OK with me! I really don't like picking up all the balls that get thrown out of it anyways! So in my opinion it's the perfect amount. I have a feeling this is gonna be a favorite for many many months!
4,Rainy Day Fun,My daughter loves this toy! I only pull it out on rainy days... and it keeps her occupied. I did purchase 100 extra balls.
3,Okay,"My son loved it the first few days and then he stopped playing with it. He only goes in the large hut. It also takes up a lot of space. So if you dont have room, not a good idea. The good thing is that you can put it away very easily and then put it back up again. So I'm going to put it away for now and hopefully he'll enjoy it again once I take it out again."
5,Kids love it -- Spurs Imagination for hours,"Bought it for our 2-year-old, and our 6-year-old could hardly wait to get his hands on it. Both kids play for hours, and make up all kinds of imaginary scenarios for their tent set-ups. Very compact for putting away... especially considering how big the tents are when they are open. We expect to get many years of play out of these. Durability is still unknown, but we've had another Play-Hut toy for years, and it looks as good as new."
5,Our 11-month Old LOVES IT!!,"We got this out for our 11-month-old yesterday, and he LOVES IT! He's at the age where he loves exploring and crawling everywhere, so he's fascinated with it. He also is at an age where he likes leaning on and grabbing everything, so the fact that this is so flexible and springs back so easily is a huge plus.My husband keeps saying that he's jealous that he didn't have a toy this cool when he was little. : We both highly recommend this!"
3,Huge for the price,"This play house is so much bigger once you get it out in the open. Does not seem very sturdy, but time will tell"
4,Great for a young baby,"I have a 9 month old boy who loves crawling around and walking around. He loves it, and crawling through the tunnels gives him a challenge. Bought seperate balls for the ball pit because the balls that came with it sucked big time they were dinky and awful. The 200 ball pack I bought for like 38 bucks was sooooo worth it! They were big and sturdy! Bottom line this playland is awesome for young babies, but it wouldn't be sturdy enough for a toddler who's tear it down. I can easily get knocked over with how toddlers play. But for a 9-12month old it's perfect."
1,Dangerous and flimsy,"Bottom line is that this toy is overpriced, flimsy, and potentially very dangerous. I wish I would have paid attention to the negative reviews of the folks that had this for a few months before having problems. Three months in and it is warped and the sharp metal edges poked through. Thankfully it stabbed my wife instead of my kids."
2,Needle & Thread Not Included,"I bought the Mega Playland for my seventeen-month old son this past Christmas. I bought it on sale for $40 after reading mixed reviews. Sure enough - upon opening I found that every piece had a couple of four-five inch spans of seam that weren't sewn. After spending an hour with my needle and thread (on Christmas morning) it was ready to go. My son likes it. Our 100 pound dog likes it too, and it seems to be holding up fine so far."
4,PlayLand Review,I bought this playland for my eighteen month old grandson. He loves the ball pit but the tunnel parts do not stay attached very well. He tries to get to the main ball pit with out going through the tunnel pieces. We ended up only attaching one tunnel to the ball pit and he still loves it! Also the small balls that gave with the playland were not enough. We had to purchase another 200 balls to make it a real ball pit!!
4,Good Buy!!,We got this for our 18 month old son for Christmas.(Santa had to come early this year).He LOVES it!! It was hard to find a good gift for his age range(or something he does not have). He really likes the ball pit. His 10 year old sister likes to chase him thru the tunnels and play with the hoop. My husband and I are so pleased with how much fun he is having. A very good buy in my opinion!
4,Ball Room Fun,"My two year old son loves this. I bought an extra 100 balls to go in the center/main room. The entire kit is a bit large for my living area, but my son only wants to play in the main compartment where the balls are. He is content to crawl around and throw himself into it for almost an hour straight every day. great toy!"
4,Cool toy!,"Very cool toy to play with! Love the fact that you can re-connect and re-arrange things easily. My 10 month old was scared to crawl in when it was assembled in one big long piece, but when I broke it up he went nuts! I can see this getting lots of use.Be sure to check the dimensions... this is BIG!"
3,Be Cautious with this toy...........fyi,"Based on the reviews posted on Amazon.com, parents with children from 6 months and up were purchasing and loving this toy. So, I bought the ""mega playland"" for my son's 1 yr Birthday!We had lots of fun with it. It's very interactive for multiple children to play or hide and seek with parent/s.But, to my shock last night, my 18 month old son's head got stuck in one of the holes under the ball hoop of the hut.It was frantic! He was crying and hurting! And, there was not very much room to cut through without cutting him. After, 3 minutes of struggle, we managed to get him out, but it was very dangerous.I'm wondering why Playhut didn't make the holes bigger or smaller b/c it will fit a child's head perfectly and then it takes a specific angel to get out.We immediatly took apart that middle section to prevent it from happening again and contacted Amazon regarding the incident."
2,inseam torn/metal frame showing,"A little scary. I'm sure it's a fluke,but the one I bought the inside of one tent had an inseam not sewn around the metal frame of tent, therefore a portion of metal frame was available to toddler. Possibility of breaking and small metal pieces was all I could invision.Therefore I sent product back. The other 2 tents were in perfect condition, as was the 3 tunnels, so as I said,I'm sure it's a fluke, but didn't want to take a chance for my 2yr old."
1,Beware - Not Same As Pictured/Described,"When purchasing this from Amazon Prime (not a third-party seller), the item that you will receive is not the Mega Playland, but rather the Megaland model. It has three compartments and two tunnels but is a a much different configuration. It can only be configured in an ""L"", not a straight line like the pictured Mega Playland model."
2,not too sturdy,This product was made a lot cheaper than a similar tunnel we bought years ago - the material is thinner and the construction & seams a lot less sturdy. I don't expect it to last long. The basketball goal ripped off the first day. It's just a matter of time for the rest of it!
5,My daughter loves this toy!,"I bought this for my daughter's first birthday and she loves it! She plays with it every day and sometimes brings other toys inside so she can use it as her own little house. While I would give this toy 5 stars because of how much she enjoys it, I have 3 caveats:1. Her older cousins played with it very roughly and were able to rip the fabric above the flaps.2. The balls DO come out of the play hut fairly easily so you will spend a lot of time picking them off the floor.3. The balls included are not sufficient so you do need to buy at least 100 more or plan not to use the balls at all. (That's what I did since I got tired of picking them up)With all that said though, I would purchase this toy again."
2,Flimsy and Seams Coming Apart,"I think it is a hit or miss on this product. I have a friend that has a Playhut and it is fine. We just opened ours and at least 6 seams are coming undone (not sewn correctly), there are a couple holes in the material, 2 forgotten attachment loops, and it is rather flimsy. Kids still like it, though it isn't going to last too long."
4,"Very cute play tent, great for small children","My 15 month old enjoys playing in her play tent a little, mostly just crawling through it right now. I think when she gets a little older, she'll enjoy it more. My only complaint about the tents are the velcro tabs that connect the tents to the tunnels and to each other. When you get kids tugging on this very light tent, the tabls can tear. It would be very nice if they made them to connect with zippers."
4,Good Buy - colors pictured may vary,"I bought this for my son's 2nd birthday. He likes it a lot, especially the balls that came with it. The colors are not what is pictured. His playroom is primary colors, red, blue, green & yellow. I was thrilled when I saw the picture that it would work well in his playroom. What I recvd was purple, orange, aqua green and yellow. I was disappointed. The customer/consumer pictures are what you actually receive not those posted on the Toys R Us site. The product overall is easy to put up and seems durable and my 2 year old loves the tunnels and tent. It large so make sure you have plenty of room or only put up a portion of it."
3,So so...,"My two kids, a girl (6 yrs old) and a baby boy (just turned 1), really liked it at first but they lost their interest in about an hour of using it. They will still play with it if their friends are over but not alone (which was one of my main interests in this item... for them to entertain themselves alone). Overall, not bad but not great."
3,good toy,it is a good toy but the balls are rather small and youmust check the seams when they arrive for poor sowing
4,Concerns about the included balls,"We received the Megaland playset as a gift for our child. It was easy to set up and connect all the parts and has been enjoyed quite a bit. Our concern was with the 50 included balls. After about 10 min of playtime, our childs hands and face were all sorts of colors--FROM THE BALLS! It appears that the color for each ball rubs off with normal use! To make matters worse, the set is made in China and with all the concern about LEAD in the paints with other products, we can't help but be concerned about ink that rubs off on our childs hands and face. The balls were promptly thrown away."
4,Great fun but beware of the dye that rubs off of the balls!,"This product is a ton of fun for the kids, HOWEVER, the balls that are included with the product have a dye on them that has rubbed off onto our carpet....I now have blue circle stains on my family room carpet that I am still trying to remove."
3,a bit flimsy,This set up is a bit flimsy and the tunnels don't have anything to connect them to the tent. My son still loves it but I wish it was a bit more sturdy.
4,Inside Play fun,This set is great for indoor play. My 20th month old son loves to lay on top of the balls and roll around. It is especially fun when he has friends come over the same age to play in it too. I did purchase the extra balls and believe you could get by with what comes with the set - as I find now they are all over my living room. But either way for the price it will provide countless hours of indoor entertainment.
2,Don't waste your money even with it being 50% off!,"What a bunch of junk! Upon opening the Megaland, I noticed it was ripped at the seam in one area. This was a pretty large rip I might add. After inspecting it more I noticed about a dozen more places where it was ripped. I noticed another parent said the same thing. Now I know why it's half off! Don't waste your money."
4,Good fun for a 3 year old,Came in a (relatively) small package. On opening it found separate collapsible pieces that joined together to make a quite large playarea. As another reviewer had pointed out there are too few balls. Still it is a good buy. My son loves it.
4,Great but nylon tears,The seams start to pull away and create holes after use since it's made out of simple nylon. Ripstop might have helped. No fixing it though because it's in stretched areas which is the whole thing on this pop up. Also will need to buy more balls doesn't come with enough. Kids love it but don't see it lasting long just isn't durable enough. Owned for 6 months so far one toddler and friends using it.
2,Don't waste your money,"This book consisted of black and white 2D scetches that lacked any real depth or detail. They are basic and generalised in presenting each period and contain nothing new that you would not have already seen or known about that decade.I do not recommend it to anyone who has a intrest in costume or design, but think it would be better suited as a childrens colouring in book.Don't waste your money."
4,"As a reference book, this one was close to perfect!","I own a vintage clothing and costume rental shop. We have created tabs on some of the different era's shown in this book and now it's a perfect reference book for when a customer comes in and needs to dress for a 1903 car show, or a Titanic themed myster dinner party, etc. The drawings were nicely detailed and are even inspiring me to make my own pieces. We didn't need descriptions, just pictures and dates, and that's what you have here. The one draw back was throughout the entire book only fashion from the higher class is depicted. No peasants, middle class or lower status depictions at all. As a costume shop, those would have been helpful to have as well. I still thought this book was well worth the price!"
5,maximize your human resources capital,"Martha knows whereof she speaks, she is always on the cutting edge of business and people issues. To maximize your human resources capital, buy and devour and digest this book. It puts a perspective back into the management equation that got lost somehow along the way. The adjective in the title of this book says it all: indispenable!"
5,A refreshingly original and unique mystery thriller,"I didn't expect to be overwhelmed by this book, thinking it would be the typical albeit entertaining murder-mystery novel. Instead I encountered an exceedingly well written story with a warm, likeable protagonist and a plot that truly keeps you wondering until the last chapter. After reading this novel, I have since sought out and read all of Lindsey's novels. If you like a good, gory thriller, you have to read this book."
5,"Powerful, literate, disturbing work","David Lindsey is one of the most underrated authors in the field today. His novels are always intelligent and interesting and most emerge from authentic FBI case histories. MERCY is not so much a routine who-dun-it mystery as an exploration of the psychology of fetishes and sex, particularly kinky sex - that is assuming one doesn't consider masochism, sadism, cross-dressing, and dominatrix luncheons slightly off.There is another story beneath the obvious one and that is the practice of such behavior within the confines of polite society. The ""victimes"" are upper-class women of a certain type - the country club, suburban, once-a-week therapist type. Lindsey has a real knack for looking at events through the eyes of the disturbed individual, again calling on his real-life experience (FBI profiling).The prose is rich and sweeping, the organization superb, the entire story always a little on edge. This is deeply disturbing novel but an important one."
1,You call this a mystery?,"I don't get what people like about this book. Lindsey is a fluid writer, good describer, but his characters spend way too much time in their own heads and the action, in this book at least, is predictable and rendered downright boring. All the lurid details that are supposed to add to the ""psychoerotic"" nature of the book come off as crude and off-putting instead, like a geek at a sideshow biting the head off a chicken. And anyone who can't guess the ""surprise twist"" by page 25 wasn't reading very closely."
2,Disappointed!,"Although David Lindsey has a talent for descriptive prose, this book overall was a big disappointment to me. He did not seem to have a clear idea how the plot would unravel, and left too many loose ends. Each time I expected a new wrinkle to develop from a piece of evidence, he didn't bother to tie it in. I think it's possible that he didn't even know how it would end until it did, and at that point he was just tired of writing. If you decide to read this book, be prepared to see very ugly things with no redeeming human value, and be prepared to be left wondering . . . ""what ever happened with the ______ ?"""
2,meh,"If I wanted a map of Texas I would have purchased an atlas instead of this boring book. The author had a good idea, but despite that, the only reason I even finished the book was because I had 100 pages to go and I was too damn OCD to just leave it at that."
2,"A predictable, formulaic, thriller",Psychosexual? I figured out the plot twist in the first few pages and the murderer as soon as he/she was introduced.
2,vocals are just wrong,"Sorry to bum people out but the vocals just ruin this, if you could call them vocals. It sounds like some one mumbling some spoken words under water or outside of the house when I listen to this on my great home stereo. It would have been a better release if they just left the vocals or mumbling off. This sounds like other darkwave/ambient works, Lycia is the closest comparison except Lycia's music is well made. Sorry for the low rating but I doubt this will get much play again and I have a wide variety of tastes, I rarely exclude anything."
2,Not So Egg-cellent,You get what you pay for. The plastic is cheaply made and the eggs practically need a crowbar for pulling apart. Don't waste your $ even if it is inexpensive!My 12 month old lost interest in a minute.
1,Don't waste your money on this,Worked great for only a short time. Remote stopped working- called (not even an 800 number) and e-mailed Mega-tech - NO RESPONSE Wasted our money on this garbage!
1,Too good to be true,"At first this item seemed like a bargain, but after following the directions of drying out after the first use, it never worked again. This product literally worked great for about 15 minutes. After that, I found out it was a little water logged so I sat it down to dry. It has not worked since. If you are thinking about buying this product because it is a good price then forget about it. It is a waste of time and money."
4,Lost Balls....Found?,"Nice book, not quite as good as I expected but had some really awesome photos! AC"
2,"Great pictures, but is lacking","Beautiful pictures throughout the book. I do, however, wish there was an index or at least some way of finding certain holes in the book without having to turn every page. Overall, great pictures but poor layout."
2,Cover misleading,The cover indicated unusual scenes on the golf course. The other monthly pictures were rather ordinary.
5,Great photos,"I bought this book as a gift for a friend, but ended up sharing it with various family before wrapping it up. It was also the hit of the party when it WAS opened. Very entertaining and a book easy to pick up and look at more than once. A hit for golfers or those who enjoy a photo with a message."
4,Humor for the winter for golf lovers,"Son who is slowed by snow, is enjoying laughter over the pictures. Great for anyone who loves golf or loves someone who does."
4,Conversation Piece,Thought this would be a great coffee table book at my place in Myrtle Beach. Was in good shape as described.
2,A Cheap Introduction?,"While this book is not the most expensive on the market, it appears to have been created from a 'boiler-plate' of a series of canine books. Rather too much of it is not specific to Great Pyrenees. We have owned several Great Pyrenees and, from time to time, need information from reference sources. This book does not fall in to that category. It can be classified as ""Read through it once and then never refer to it again"".There are several other Great Pyrenees books on the market that more adequately describe the requirements of owning one of these large dogs. Andrew Jonson's attempt to address all matters relating to Great Pyrenees falls well short of the mark.This is not a book to recommend to potential or existing owners. Probably okay for children"
2,Better books out there,Nancy Cobb has some other books out there that I found to be much better than this product.
5,"Precious Moments: Timmy""s Gift",This has to be my favorite Christmas story to show children at this very special time of the year. It kept all of my stuidents engaged and at the same time reinforce the true meaning of Christmas.
5,No other product like it,"If you are looking for excercises on how to convey information visually, this is the book for you. The author is of course one of the best at this specific task so you are learning from the best. Don't expect to learn straight ""answers"" on how to make your graphics, this book is all about thinking about how to make them, but implementing the concepts can definitely vary in your actual work products."
3,Sweet Butter Kettle Corn Glaze,"Back to Basics PCG2 Sweet Butter Kettle Corn GlazeWhile a fun family activity to pop corn as I member as a child, the glaze comes out rather uneven and burns in spots. For taste I would stick with store packaged microwave Kettle Corn."
4,Excellent,"Of all the late 1960s and early 1970s vocal groups, Free Design are the most condusive to remixing.'Not that there are any like this brilliant band. Those funky hooks and jazzy candies the band made, on all their albums, placed them about ten cuts above any other group they may have been racing with.That pays off on this remix album. Free Design are the only band of this kind from the era embraced by modern bands like Stereolab. The popping, grooving basslines and clean voice sheens that made this music work so well also lend themselves extremely well to modern remixes.This music just bursted on its own, and when put in the hands of modern bands and mixers who truely love the Free Design, you get an enhanced take on that explosion of tone color the Design used to stay at the top of their game.There are two volumes of these remixes and both are worth seeking out."
3,styx2,"""Chronicles"" is the best of Styx2, meaning that those 3 discs are the best of Tommy Shaw. Styx is no longer about good music,it's more like just how are we(meaning Shaw,Young,and whomever they can get to play with them) going to pay the bills, without Dennis DeYoung to carry us. Tommy Shaw coerced James Young to fire Dennis because he didn't like to do ""shows"" and now they have to find other has beens like REO to tour with to draw people to their shows. ""Chronicles"" are the best albums Tommy Shaw has been on, and that includes his solo drab. Go see Dennis instead his concerts have the good old Styx feel. Don't buy ""Chronicles"" and put money in Shaw's ego, buy Styx1,Styx2,Man of Miracles,Serpent is Rising, and Equinox to hear the Real Styx."
3,What a fun game!!!,20 Questions is lots of fun either by yourself or with one other or even in a group -- love it ....
3,A very interesting and interactive game,This is a good party game. It gets your guests laughing and interacting with one another
5,20Q,"I bought this product as an extra gift for my 6 year old granddaughter. It encourages her to read the questions, which helps improve reading skills. Not only did she enjoy playing with 20Q, but all the adults wanted to play with it too. They were amazed at how good the ball was at guessing the answer.Because of all the fun we shared with 20Q, one of the adults in our party bought one for his grandchildren."
4,Great toy but Hard to turn off: A review from a kid.,"pro's :great fun, portable.con's: hard to read LED except in darkness ,no off button.As soon as I got this toy I started playing it.but then ,I found out that in bright light I could not see the LED so I went in some shade.Now thats just fine except theres no shade indoors!so I found a dull light and used it.But then I brushed the yesbutton and no button would turn it off so I had to play it though.But overall if you have a dull reading light and you are patient, buy this product."
3,"Fun at first, but gets predictable...","When I first tried out this game it was at a friends house and I was enthralled by its ability to guess just about anything, but after getting one of my own and playing through it about five or six times it got to be very predictable. You know before you start playing whether it is something it will guess or not. It will guess most things, even obscure things like ""dust"" or ""nothing"", but it wont be able to figure out ""fingernails"". This might be fun at first but it gets boring real quick. I would say its great to show to your friends, but it really is not fun to sit there and watch them play. Spend your money on something else, you'll be happier."
3,Not amazing,"This toy wins all the time, but it's not that amazing. I played this with my friend, the machine asked us LOTS of questions, like how big is it? what color is it? what shape is it? how many legs does it have? It's like the same as asking: What is it? Except asking more questions. So it's not that all amazing, but it can cure your boredom in the backseat ride, of course."
5,Fun for all ages!,"In my opinion, the best toys are those that educate as well as entertain, don't come with a lot of detachable parts that will just get lost or chewed up by the dog, and are small enough and durable enough to travel with. This meets all the criteria, and it's entertaining for adults as well as kids."
5,Fun for adults too!!,When I first saw this toy I didn't think I would like it until I tried it. It is fun!! It's a good fun game for adults. It's funny the things you can come up with and most of the time this game is right!! [...]
4,20 Questions,"This is a very good version of 20 Q with a vast data bank. The only problem I can find is that it can't guess itself as the thing you're thinking of! You can set sound on/off (just beeps); answer yes, no, sometimes, or unknown; and the set speed of the scrolling. When it asks you what type of thing it is, things that are normally vegetable (like ""chair"" if it's made from wood, ""paper"", ""maple syrup"") fall under the ""other"" category. ""Vegetable"" only holds vegetables (parsley, spinach...)."
3,Great Stocking Stuffer,"I bought several for stocking stuffers. They were a hit. Everyone tries to outwit this little toy. I bought it to play during road trips, but it's fun anytime."
5,Surprisingly Perplexing...Even for Adults!,"Not just for the kids...this thing is smarter than you think. I keep it in my purse to play with while waiting for a table at a restaurant, or waiting anywhere, in the car, RV or at home. The only problem that we encountered was when the sun or light is shining right on it, it is hard to read the screen and sometimes the dots go out, but for the price, it can be easily ignored or replaced. We thought that we could trick it by answering ""NO"" to everything and seeing what it came up with...and it answered ""Nothing!"" That was the truth! We did not think of anything. We then tried answering ""Yes"" to every question and it answered ""Everything"". This thing is very surprisingly smart. It occasionally does not guess it correctly, but usually it is how the people are answering the questions that determine the outcome."
5,AMAZING!!!,"My brother bought 20Q for my daughter for her 11th birthday. I love the fact that you actually have to read it, it's not just a brainless game. I couldn't believe it guess the things it guessed! (Not just 'bird' but 'turkey' and 'cardinal'!)It got a little creepy after it guessed all the things I was thinking of....! I actually thought it had ears! It has been stumped a couple of times though... Over all a really cool toy for $10 - I'm going to get one for my sister-in-law and her husband for Christmas - they'll love it!"
5,Amazing little gadget!,"I went to a granddaughter's birthday party today with my wife. The other grandparents were there, other people as well, kids and grownups both. Someone started playing with the Q20 and it passed from one person to another. One of my grandkids thought ""toilet"" and it guessed right away correctly. This is a great little novelty item. I see that it's out of stock now at Amazon. Backorder it or snatch it up wherever you see it as a stockting stuffer."
2,Not like the ones I've seen--not as good,"Instead of being a better product, this one is made cheaper and seems flimsy and doesn't respond like the ""older"" versions. Aren't things supposed to get better? This one is made in China--where all the leaded paint and computer things are being messed with/sabatoged?Wish I'd gone into a store and looked at it, held it (this one is lighter & not good quality) and the color is dark (not the bright red or blue I've always used/seen) and hard to read the text, too.Would have sent it back, but for the shipping costs (which ran up the price)."
3,Nothing really new or different,"This toy is a cross between Trivial Pursuit, 20 Questions, and the Magic 8 Ball. It's fun for awhile, and might be fun for car trips, but I got bored with it and it became borderline annoying with the constant questions from the kids...."
2,"May seem fun at first, but it won't last you long.","The computer is smart, I admit. But there are a few tricks against it. The first day of use you may be flattered, but how long are people really going to use this."
2,not a very good item,When i got this for Christmas i was excited i started playing and i chose a mongoose it got 20 questions an didn't get it so it took 5 more guesses. the game isn't 25 questions its 20 ans its range of guesses aren't vast and if you won it would say you got lucky but if it wins it laughs in your face after 25 questions.
2,20-Questions Handheld Game - Big Disappointment,"This game, although somewhat fun, is very limited in its capacity. The only way that the game is able to guess the item about which you are thinking, is if you choose something (an object, etc.) that is very simple, and that you can describe with great accuracy. Otherwise, the game guesses your thoughts incorrectly most of the time. It is not very sophisticated, and is truly not worth the money. In other words, do not buy this product."
5,Fun!,"Some of the questions are rather lame. ""Does it weigh more than a pound of butter?"" It is a good timewaster though. Especially for kids on long car trips :)."
5,Awesome Fun,"My whole family is fighting over this gem! Granted, 20Q misses some easy ones, and gets some really hard ones, but it is one of the funnest things I have played in a while. A must have for long trips. My only problem is that it is flimsy."
5,Amazing! It knows almost EVERYTHING!,"My friend from school gave me this game because I was really interested in it. This game is so much fun! It knows everything you're thinking of even when you try your hardest to stump it. Sometimes, you do stump it, but if it is an obvious word like ""computer,"" ""lamp,"" or ""chair,"" it automatically knows! I love this game and it never gets old! Some adults like it more than kids do."
5,This 20Q is Fantastic! Astounding! Amazing! and FUN,"If you are sitting at home and watching a television show you have seen 5 times before, pick up the 20Q for hours of fun instead. Whatever is on your mind this little computer guesser can figgure it out. From Lizzard to Poop it is all in here. Give in a try and you will be hooked!"
5,I'm addicted,This is a great stocking stuffer. Once you start playing you won't be able to put it down until you stump 20Q!
4,20 Questions is a Hoot!,"This game is a lot of fun. I love the smart aleck way it talks to me. Sometimes I stump it. Often the challenge is, ""how well did I answer the questions?"" Sometimes I replay the game answering questions differently and the ""toy"" finally gets it right. Fun on many levels. AND...a great gift. I've given 3 so far."
5,"20th question, How do i get one",i love this toy. i want it for Christmas.it is so fun and it has an amazing talent. i am hooked on mine now. Were is yours???
3,Radica,"The ""Radica 20 Questions"" seemed like it would be a fun game for two older children that I have. I purchased the item based on TV commercials. I was dissapointed when you had to do more answering of questions before the game would or could answer you questions. It did not seem to interest my children at all. Ordering was easy and I was satisfied with customer service when I called."
5,GET THIS TOY FOR EVERYONE ON YOUR CHRISTMAS LIST!,"I must say this is the funnest toy I have played with in a long time. My son, who is 8 got this toy and he played with it for hours. His Dad and I played with it for hours! We ended up buying the larger version for everyone on our Christmas list, both kids and adults! It takes a very simple game and turns it into hours of amusement. It is amazing! Order one now!!"
5,Great toy for the reader,"As long as your child can read, this toy is terrific. It may be a battery drainer, though. The set it came with ran out very fast and we're waiting to see what happens with the new ones. I would expect that if we bought it in a retail store, but not online where, I assume, kids aren't toying with it beforehand."
4,Great Reference,"Afolabi Epega did a great job in his explanation of the 256 Odus. The ""western"" observation and the introduction written by Philip Neimark could have been left out and the book would have been better off. It is a shame that Oluwo Afolabi Epega is even remotely affiliated with Philip Neimark in this book"
2,Poorly Interpreted,"This book is so riddled with inaccuracies that even Mr. Neimark doesn't recommend it. I have attended workshops with Mr. Neimark and all I can say is ""Run, don't walk, the other way."""
5,BRILLIANT!!,"Paul Kelly has produced a brilliant album in Under The Sun. It really describes life in Australia from humorous - ""Dumb Things"" to Joyous ""40 Miles To Saturday Night"" to sad ""To Her Door"". The best track on the album for my money is Bradman. Those in the States may not appreciate how much this man is revered in this country. I guess he could be compared to someone like Babe Ruth in baseball. Through his amazing feats on the cricket field, Bradman lifted the spirits of ordinary Australians during the dark days of the depression and the war years. Kelly tells a masterful story in this song. It really does justice to this monumental figure in Australian cricket. Great album - have a listen! You won't be disappointed."
5,Fantastic stuff,"This is a must have CD. Pure, generic, pop-rock at its best.It is a shame that Paul Kelly is not really appreciated in this country. I have been a fan for last ten years and have most of the stuff on good old vinyl.This is strongly recommended for anyone who is willing to understand what Australia and Aussies are really about."
1,Disappointed and Shocked,"I bought the Olivia Body Oil just showed like the picture sevel times in Greece. My wife felt it good. So I want to buy some again.I found it and the picture showed just like the same thing what I wanted. I put my trust in it. I am so disappointed and shocked with what shipped to me! It is not at all like the picture showed me, including the bottle and the something in it. I do not know what happened. I just feel being deceived! If there is zero star I can choose, I will.Sorry for my English."
3,"Disney film ""Rascal""","Well done, but strays far from the content of the novel. It begins with the acquisition of the racoon and continues with the actual relationship of father and son."
3,Watch it sometime,"This is an OK little Disney film, not great. Watched it with my grandparents who are in their 80's and they enjoyed it and I think children will too. Not as good as Old Yeller but worth a Sunday afternoon look."
4,A Great Film for Animal Lovers,"Disney did a good job of incorporating Sterling North's story of ""Rascal"" into a film. The film version remains close to the book's story. While Rascal is mainly a children's film, it also good for viewers who love animals. The raccoon does a lot of cute things the film has a relatively happy ending."
2,Disappointing actually:,"...I thought it was going to be another film like ""the Incredible Journey"" or even like ""air bud"". My son loves both these pet films and I thought this one would be cute like those. But, I actually found it to be alittle long and 'draggy'. I didn't really feel like it ever enticed even my attention. I just couldn't develop the love for the animals and characters in this one, like i did in ""the Incredible Journey"" and ""Air Bud"". Anyway, For [the money], I really can't complain. Maybe we'll give the movie another try in 6 months. I'll keep it in the video cabinet for now."
3,How about the Nippon Animation series?,"This movie may be a classic, but I would love to see the Nippon Animation TV series of Araiguma Rascal."
4,A pleasant growing up story,"I actually have the book on which this film is based, and given the constraints of time, the film script follows the book pretty well.Billy Mumy was a well-chosen cast member for the principal role.The film must have been pretty difficult to execute given that an animalis involved with most of the scenes.The film is typical of many of the Disney films which can generate empathyand emotion in the viewer, but do not have any unpleasant scenes disturbing enough to make young viewers cry. It is a very pleasant andsometimes humorous story of youth growing up in a time gone by."
2,Not So Good,"This one was made after Disney died, Billy Mummy is too old for the role he plays, and it's often too dark, and it sometimes really drags. Mummy's scenes--where he's supposed to exhibit deep emotion and sympathy--are as annoying as fingernails on a chalkboard. Better to buy Charlie the Lonesome Couger, or the one about the Yellowstone Bears or the earlier version of ""The Incredible Journey,"" the one they only have on videotape."
4,a good bed,"We got this bed for our 2.5 year old. he loves it, sleeps well in it. putting it together was pretty easy, in some places the picture doesn't line up perfectly , but it's not too big of a deal, esp. for the price. It's a pretty sturdy bed, but I wouldn't let my son jump on it."
1,Cute but not functional,"This bed is very cute! But the sides do not come up high enough, to at act as side rails. But high enough to cause injury when rolling around in the bed, as my toddlers do. But, your toddler will love it...and you'll need to buy a new bed soon."
1,Dangerous wouldn't advise buying,I bought these beds for my twin 2 year olds. They look great and yes they are durable but they are dangerous. The wood frame is not rounded off and if they fall on to them they will hurt themselves. My kids like most roll around all the time as well and I constantly hear their heads and body banging into the wood. I don't understand why someone would make a product geared towards little children but not make them safe. The frame absolutely should be rounded off not sharp as it is. I am moving on and buying plastic car beds for them so that way they do fall or hit themeselves on it the outcome won't be so severe. I wish I would have known this when I purchased them. I thought you should know before buying.
4,"Good idea, good quality for the price","When I purchased this bed in early January it was only $74.00 + $28.00 in shipping. The bed seems to be good quality. The picture doesn't show that the bed comes with the number 95 that you are supposed to screw into the side of the bed for a 3-d effect. For some reason both sides for our bed had the screw go through the number. It wasn't really a big deal, but something to watch out for. Bed was very close to the size of a crib mattress-which was what I was looking for because I don't have a lot of space. My child loves it though! I got him some cars sheets and he was more than happy to give up his crib for the new baby."
