1,Unimpressive Family Feature.,"It is a family friendly movie. But it is so lame, it is very hard to watch it all. I could not."
4,Eddie Murphy is still funny,"First, Eddie Murphy must live in a time warp. The guy was doing stand up when I was in college; 20+ years later, he looks great and still has it. I was skeptical about the premise of this movie, but the kids (10 and 12) wanted to see it. It was great. It sends a good message, flows well, and does it all without any four letter words."
4,Fun,I bought this for a friend's christmas present and he liked it a lot and from what I've listened too it's pretty good alternative.
5,Best CD Ever!,Oh my gosh! This CD blew me away when I first listened to it. Everyone should have it. I can't stop listening to it. It's absolutley amazing! Every single song on this album should be released as a single! I'm not kidding either. It's just great! Get it!
5,<3 shinedown,love this cd i only ordered this as a copy to give a friend very good songs my fav. is num.3 and burning bright and simple man and 45. so many good songs
5,I f you like hard hitting rock with philosophy.,"This is a hard hitting rock band with a twist of philosophy. The lyrics are new and vibrant, you will be delighted. I have seen this band, recently in Kansas City , the show was an acoustical version in a small venue, it is one of the best concerts I have attended. The Sound of Madness is fantastic. Check this band out!"
2,Disappointing trend,"I believe that Shinedown is a very good band, and that their first CD was pretty impressive, but I have stated to notice a bad trend with artists recently. They come out with 2 or 3 new songs and come out with a remake of the only CD that they have made. I think that the artists need to continue making new songs and wait to re-release CDs until they at least have a few under their belt. I can't wait until they come out with a new CD."
2,Not great,"I ordered this on amazon.com hoping it would be awesome, but it completely let me down. This is not worth it at all. The music is very heavy and sounds the same throughout. Next time I'll be more careful of what I spend my money on. I wouldn't recommend this cd. It's loud, obnoxious, and it just drives me crazy! Don't spend your money on this. Save it for something better."
2,If You Like Nickelback then...,"...you'll like this album. This band just doesn't distinguish themselves here and alot of the songs sound too similar to really garner much interest. It's not a horrible album, but it's the conventional Nickelback-sounding style that is unfortunately the norm nowadays."
2,I feel scammed,"I really love this album, I bought it in Chicago while I was on vacation, but now I feel ripped off because I was sold the standard version that is missing 3 tracks that I really love :( and I ended up paying over $15 for it at Sam Goodie :( I wish that they'd only sell one release of this album instead of calling both versions ""Enhanced"""
4,I love Shinedown,I have Shinedown's cd and wanted to get all the cd's so I started with the first one. I really like the song 45.
1,who?,"Guys, do you as a band realize that at a VH show, nobody really knows who you are or even cares? And second, release a second Cd that actually makes some chart movement before acting like all-time classic rockers."
5,THIS ALBULM ROCKS MY SOCKS!,"I ACTUALLY GOT INTRODUCED TO SHINEDOWN FROM A GUY,TANNER, THAT MY GRANDPA HIRED AND I SORTA LIVED W/ WHILE WE WERE VISITING MY GRANDPA.WHEN TANNER WOULD PLAY BASKETBALL W/ ME HE WOULD TURN UP HIS TRUCK AND CRANK THESE GUYS.WHEN I FIRST HEARD ""SIMPLE MAN"" I GOT A NEW FAVORITE SONG.THESE GUYS HAVE GREAT BEATS, SONGS, VOICES...I MEAN THEY DONT SCREAM, U DONT HAVE TO STRAIN TO HEAR WHAT THEIR SAYING AND THATS ALWAYS A PLUS.IF U PARENTS HAVE A KID WHOSE INTO ROCK HAVE THEM LISTEN TO THESE SAMPLES ITS A GREAT GIFT.AND FOR U COACHES AND ATHLETES OUT THERE THESES R GREAT SONGS TO WARM UP TO BEFORE A GAME.THEY JUST GET U PUMPED.THEY R FAST AND FUN TO WARM UP TO BEFORE A VOLLEYBALL OR BASKETBALL GAME(OR WHATEVER)I REALLY HOPE U GUYS BUY THIS C-D, I LOVED IT AND EVERYONE THAT I HAD LISTEN TO IT WANTS IT.BUY IT ULL LOVE IT!!!!AFTON S."
5,Great Band,"Not only does this CD completely rule, but these guys are SO great live. 3 Doors Down came and Shinedown was the first opening, then Tantric (they sucked majorly).I alomst jumped out of my seat when Shinedown played ""From The Inside"". I was amazed how good he did it. And ""45"". Holy crap. It was the first time I had ever heard it. I fell in love with it. So...YEAH!"
5,Amazing,"All I can say about this band is that they are truly amazing. I hadn't heard of them until I got tickets to see a 3 doors down show and found out that they were on the bill. After hearing fly from the inside on the radio, so searched and found a lot of their music and bought the cd. I instantly fell in love with it and have been listening to it for the last month. The band puts together a total package in this cd. Great lyrics, amazing guitar, etc... At the concert I got to meet and talk to the band and they are a really cool group of guys. I'd recommend this cd to just about anyone who is into rock music. A must have."
4,Almost 5 stars except for obvious production problems,"Got the 2004 Enhanced CD yesterday from a local store and listened for 3 hours straight. Almost all the songs on it are great and I will definitely keep an eye on this band for further CD's. However, wondering if anyone else has had the problems I had. The 15th Track, an acoustic version of ""45"", would not copy to computer -- kept getting error message. I exchanged the CD and got same error message with the replacement CD. Also, this enhanced 2004 CD says it includes a video of ""45"" and contains a 16th ""data track"", but video will not play in either computer or DVD player. Has anyone else had this problem? Would like to know before I purchase a third copy of this CD."
4,A Great Gift...,I got this CD as a gift for my brother. He had heard the group before and really liked them. I recommend Amazon to find the older albums from this group.
2,hmmm,"not the greatest, a couple of the songs i liked, but i just couldn't get into the cd. Some of the lyrics are not that great."
2,"Disillusioned, Disenfranchised . . .",". . . and this album should be Discarded.If you're into self-pity, this album is for you. ""Fly From The Inside"" is a pretty good single, athemic, lots of promise there, but it is not at all indicative of the rest of the album. The rest descends into ""I'm in pain . . . I'm in so much pain . . . look at the darkness around me . . . PAIN"" shlock. At one point, the singer actually says ""I'm staring down the barrel of a .45"" (in an I-can't-take-it-anymore context, not in an I'm-being-mugged context).It's like Ozzy's music with Morrisey's lyrics. One star being the lowest I can go, I give it two, because the music's slightly better than mediocre (although the drummer almost ruins one of the songs by overplaying), and the singer's got above average range for this day and age."
4,Best new band out there right now!,I first heard 'Fly From the Inside' on my local station here in Knoxville. They have a thing called Southeast Exports where you can listen to local bands and stuff. It was first played on there before it was released too the public.I was really impressed by the vocals and the type of chorus effect on the guitars. They just came through K-Town with 3 Doors Down and they completely blew the other bands off the stage. This is probably the best new rock album this year!
3,average,"The cd sure does start with a bang. ""Fly From the Inside"" is an awesome track. Unfortunately the first track is the best one. The rest of the cd contains a few above average songs, but mostly just songs that fail to really stand out. ""45"" and the cover song ""Simple Man"" are actaully torture to sit through. Brent Smith just tries way too hard and the vocals end up being bloated. A local dj described it best when he said the performance on these songs sounded like a male version of Christine Aguillera. There is an art to singing that requires knowing when to be subtle and Brent has yet to learn it. The band as potential. Maybe their next cd will be better."
3,The Underdogs,The First Song i heard from them was 45. It was good but nothing special. It wasnt Until Their concert with soil in corpus christi that i thought they were awesome. Their good in concert and the singer can sing his ass off!!! Buy the cd its worth it.
3,"A Bit of a Letdown, But Not Bad","I bought this album on the stregnth of ""Fly From the Inside"" and "".45"", and the positive reviews here. While there are other decent songs on this album, none come close to either of those. I think the reviewers were a little over-zealous in their praise for Shinedown. The band is obviously talented, and the singer has a powerful voice with a great range, but the songwriting comes up a little short overall. I would say this band is a better version of Nickelback, so if you like them (I don't) you will enjoy the album."
3,"Solid, But We've Heard It Before","While not being exactly original, Shinedown have put together a pretty catchy album all the same. Singer Brent Smith and co. mix AIC type moodiness ""Lost In The Crowd,"" with the Nickelback on steroids rock of ""Stranger Inside."" Smith's voice ranges anywhere from Layne Stayley's moan ""Left Out,"" to more Aaron Lewis(Staind)heights, ""45."" The album itself is somewhat overproduced, restraining some of its punch as evidenced on the dense mixes of songs like ""All I Ever Wanted."" Overall, the band is tight and has promise, if they can find a more focused sound."
4,solid album,"if there was a 4.5,i would use that.i saw them live with pm5k, and to say the least i was a bit disappointed.but the cd was cheap and i went and picked it up because i love fly from the inside.i was pretty amazed by the first couple of tracks and it just kept getting better.they sound like a very mature saliva cross bred with what wouldve been a modern day alice in chains.this is a very good cd and worth your time to listen to."
4,PRETTY GOOD,"I recently just boutght this cd and it is good in most ways. It has a great song ""Fly from the Inside"". It is a hard rock kind of cd. Some other good tracks are ""45"" and ""No More Love"". IF YOUR A SLIPKNOT FAN THEY HAVE A NEW CD COMING OUT MAY 25, 2004. Thats all I have to say."
3,I've got a headache....,"And my ears are bleeding. Ok, I understand you have a powerful voice, but tone it down, tiger. All I hear on the radio is 45 and Simple Kind of Man. The playing is great, but the singing is over the top. Try singing rather than yelling. Good God. I have to turn down my radio when these songs come on. I feel sick."
4,Cream City -- Aalon,I have been searching for this CD for a long time. I remember it from when I first arrived in Los Angeles. To me this is a gem and an under-appreciated project. I have not taken it out of my player since I got it. Glad I found it.
4,Not an Easy Read But An Important One,"Meron Benvenisti is a real expert on Israel and her history. Though this book is a bit rough going it is worth the effort. He shows the history of the current struggle in Israel/ Palestine and his writing is trustworthy, especially since he is a main participant in solving the seemingly insolvable. You will have new insights into the Holy LandS."
2,Better Covered Elsewhere,"The book is well researched, but the subject is better covered in any one of Benny Morris's books. Morris's One State, Two States effectively demolishes Benvenisti's argument in favor of a ""bi-national"" state."
2,Unconfortable for eyeglasses users,"I use for 9 hours a days, good sound quality (in and out),but the pressure over your ear and the eyeglasses temple cover,make this product unweareable after 15-20 minutes and you needto place incorrectly.I use for 3 years a Plantronics S12 with an over-the-earsupport and combined with eyeglasses works perfectly.If the idea can be moved to the manufacturer..."
1,Disappointed,Must not have any quality control before shipping. Right lense was spattered with something that had to be scaped off and left scratches. Couldn't return it for another because of time restraints. A waste.
3,Good for prop use,"OK, I ordered 4 of these for our BOB's, I was hoping they were the M-15 style looking types found in two of the descriptions photos. They're not. These are the cheesy looking ones without the extra exhaust/talking port. The elastic strap works great and the mask creates a good seal. You can test by covering the filter hole, breath in and wait to see if it re-inflates by itself, if it does, you do not have a good seal. I wouldn't trust the old filters and I do not like the smaller eye holes and missing exhaust/talking port. If you had to run for a distance, exhaust is your friend and fog is your foe. Also, the filter gets in the way a little if you are using a scope, a side mounted filter might be a better choice."
3,fits good but breathing...,this gas mask is good besides the fact that is is a little duffiucltto to breath but is very cumfortable
4,Great mask for low price !!,"I've collected gas masks for the past 15 years, and i have bought pretty expensive ones so i didnt had great expectations for this one ($20+)But it was quite a surprise, quality mask, no cheap glued in rubber, includes a brand new tottally sealed filter and a nice drinking tube. A great mask for collectors and paranoid people alike !!!! Specially since the price for a single filter is $8+ !!!! This includes filter, mask and tube for 24 bucks =)"
4,"Good buy, wont trust life on it.","The one i got was made in '81. I loved wearing it, bought it for photography reasons. I had bought it on a Thursday and it was at my house on Monday w/ standard shipping!!! Super cool buy, Wont really trust my life on it though."
5,Brithday,"My grandson wanted this for his brithday, which was yesterday and he loves it. He played with it last night for a couple of hours before bed time."
3,"Good mask, no drinking straw or canteen as advertised.","Good mask, a very good quality rubber, only thing i was disappointed was it didn’t come with a drinking straw or canteen as advertised."
4,Awesome deal,"Item was shipped fast and in great condition. It comes with a drinking tube but I hear it won't worth with the U.S. canteen so I got one for $8 on Amazon. The filter was sealed but wrapped inside the actual mask so it rubbed the lenses in transit causing some scratches but nothing to affect visibility. The plastic is pliable allowing for a good seal and the straps/buckles work easily. Those of you worried that these are 80s military surplus and therefore too old, I wouldn't worry. The 20 year mark is the ""warranty"" so to speak the manufacturer does not guarantee them past that. Just because your car is out of warranty doesn't mean it stops working right? If you want to go spend $200 for a new mask go ahead, but for the money this will do the job in a pinch and something is better than nothing."
4,shtf ... this will work.,i gave 4 instead of 5 cuz its not the newest but as far as the (...) says it is still good. So get a few filters for j.i.c. and definatly sum of the newer ones rated till march of 2016. damn israelis are good!
4,"Good quality, exactly what I was looking for.","The gas mask, considering its journey from Israel to the US, is in very good condition. The only problem I found with it is that the lens for the eyes were both a bit scratched. Despite the lack of some sort of a manual or instructions, it was easy to figure out all of the functions of the gas mask. I got the gas mask exactly on the estimated delivery date. I would easily recommend this gas mask for its quality and PRICE."
3,"Never buy a gas mask from amazon, unless you are in the know.","The saying of ""you get what you paid for"" is very valid here. It is surplus, which means that it is old. These masks have a 20 year rating. Mine was made in 87, so its 24 years old. Its therefor, not as effective as it could be. I wish I had known before I bought it that way I could at least be aware of if its efficacy. That said, something is better than nothing. My next mask will be 100% recently made, new."
1,Bad choice,"This book and mostly all of the Osborne series contains a lot of text whith no meaning at all. If you have a good understanding of the four core modules (especially the 3rd core), the added value of this book is almost nothing at all. Secondly the layout of the book makes this book very hard to read, although it's English... Compared to the four core books of Microsoft Press self, no other rating than one star is well deserved."
2,Don't buy this book,"I hate the format of this book. It's layout and the way that the book is organized totally detracts from it's content. And it's content is fairly week as well. It's basically just a bunch of questions that has in depth answers. I can't imagine that this book would actually help someone pass the 70-220 exam.I've been working with Windows 2000 since before it was release; administrating AD, migrating domains, and testing security aspects of it. I am very familiar with subject of the book and it is just poorly presented and explained.I gave it 2 stars because some people may actually make use of it, but only combined with other books. Get something from the the Exam Cram or Exam Prep series, or from New Riders."
4,great book,"This was a great book. It had a wonderful plot, good characters, and beautiful descriptions. I only had one problem with it.The two characters, Yeager and Zoe where a bit repetative. Their relationship stayed the exact same for about 6 chapters. They would start kissing etc. Then all of a sudden they would stop, ingore each for a few days then it would start again. This bugged me because the book became some what boring and repetative.Thankfully it picked up after that little part. Overall it was a wonderfulu ubook and I would recomend it to anyone whos loves a great romance story, or just needs that comfort of a great book.I would classify it as 4 and a half stars."
5,IF YOU LOVE SUSAN ELIZABETH PHILLIPS...,"You'll love Christie Ridgway. She has that same wonderfully breezy, funny style of SEP's, and just like SEP, when you least expect it, the emotions of the story jump up and grab you. Zoe is so sincere, so good. She trying so hard to hold her life together and has such a wonderfully optimistic soul. Yeager is world-weary and blind-sided by her. And Deke doesn't stand a chance against a very determined Lyssa, who has all sorts of secrets of her own."
1,wish I hadn't bothered......,"to read this book. Any book that starts out with a ""blow up doll"" makes me cringe. Then, the sister of the main character approaches the man of her dreams and they do a sidestep sort of dance. Why I bothered to continue through to the end of this book is beyond me. I never felt like I was on the island. And, I couldn't picture the view of what the writer was trying to express. I doubt any man would behave in the way the character behaved. After being ""blown off"" several times by the main character, he kept coming back for more. I wish I had not wasted my money on this one. You will too."
5,"Everything You Could ""Wish"" For!","Aside from author Christie Ridgway, I have to offer my thanks to the editors at Amazon.com for this recommendation. I devoured this book in a day. On the bus, on my lunch hour, during dinner, after dinner...well, you get the picture. I mean, what more could you wish for in a romance novel? A super,sexy ex-astronaut, his big-wig NASA pal, and a pair of beautiful, joined-at-the-hip sisters, who run the Islands Bed and Breakfast Inn, set smack in the middle of a lush, fairy tale Island in the Pacific. No deep, twisting plots or dangerous villians here, just hours of pure escapist pleasure. A true love story -through and through. I will most definately be seeking our more books by Ms. Ridgway, and know that ""Wish You Were Here"" will be joing the good old 'keeper' shelf of my personal library. It is total enjoyment,just as perfect for your day at the beach, as for a rainy afternoon trapped indoors. This is one book you'll never regret buying."
3,Read quick before it falls apart.,"The information was very comprehensive. However, the book construction was of very poor quality and started to fall apart in the first week I received it. For the cost it should at least have the quality of a hardback."
5,Holst will get you goin',"If you've never listened to Holst ""other"" music (besides the very unexeciting ""Planets""), you're in for a treat. It's a shame there isn't more wind music out there, because it can take you a lot of places if you let it. Having trouble getting going in the morning? Put Holst's ""March"" on your car CD and you'll be in a better mood by the time you get to work. Other pieces could work nicely as movie soundtracks, ballet music, etc. Everything is lyrical, rhythmic, ever-changing, accessible, easy to get into, and mostly upbeat. Give Holst's wind music a try!"
1,stepbystep if you buy the trailer-in-the-box,"This document is a complete rip-off if you haven't bought the actual product.Then, and only then,... if you have already purchased the trailer-in-a-box from the manufacturer that this article was written for, then this ""numbered"" step-by-step could ever be useful to you.And not even then.Amazon ought to be ashamed for even considering the selling of this item.I felt abused and screwed by a company that I have trusted.Read the fine print~!"
2,If only it were true . . .,"I wish this book really taught me how to travel through time because if it did, I would go back in time and tell myself not to buy this book."
2,An ok read,I was lied to someone told me that this book would tell me how to change yourlooks but it doesnt tell you how to do that i have read this book 4 times and its not in their. but eveything else sounds fun
1,Rubbish,"As someone who is visiting the year 2004 from the future, I can tell you that this book is bloody rubbish! I was sent here from the year 2097 to gain access to a document the is needed by the USE to provide a legal footing for the suspension of the Kilo-Euro. That document will be sold on eBay in November of this year and lost if I am not able to buy it. I have been here since 01 March to allow time for me to become proficient in the use of non-cerebral interface computers, understand your customs, set up a bank accout and earn money to pay for the document I need. I wish I could go into more detail about how time manipulation works, but that could cause some real problems for me. Let me just say that it is a very simple mechanical process that could have been mastered in the 1920s if someone had just thought of it."
2,A Waste of Time,"I read this book, put it down, and laughed. Even though Commander X is good at putting details in his books, I can't believe anybody would actually think time travel is possible. Yesterday no longer exists and tomorrow doesn't exist yet. You cannot travel through time, trust me. I don't care what any of those scientists say. God would never let man have the ability to change history or the future, it would screw everything up. And as for the time machines, if these devices really worked, the whole world would know about it by know. Interesting stories in this book though."
1,trail-tech marlin 336 stock,"Don't waste your money if ur looking for a quality stock this isn't it. I didn't expect much due to the price but seen better quality on toy guns. Didn't fit well super thin plastic, still had dried up glue all over the butt plate. I just opted to keep the old wood instead, after seeing this thing. I only wish Hogue would make somthing for this model. Maybe I was only expecting the same quality for approx. same price. I was definitely wrong."
1,Moldy Crust :(,They came in with mold :( -- they sent it again to me and it had mold again. Will never order them again.
1,Green and Blue Mold on two of the eight crusts,"I was very disappointed with the whole grain pizza crust I ordered. They arrived in a timely manner, they were well packed, but the sealed box of 8 individually wrapped crust hid the fact that 2 of the crusts were in very bad shape, lots of green mold on top and bottom of the entire crust. I will be very hesitant to order this product again."
5,I've enjoyed making pizza with this crust,"my wife and I enjoy making pizza crust from scratch, but with two young children at home we are stretched for time. rustic crust allow us to make our own pizzas quickly and without making a big mess."
5,Enjoy This Book Very Much,"I think something must be wrong with me because I read this book twice and each time I ENJOYED it. Forget the grammatical errors. That doesn't have anything to do with the book on a whole. I'm a reader not a PROOF-reader. As a military spouse and I found the book funny and a page-turner. As I mentioned before, I read it twice.Sonia"
1,Awful,THis book was horrible even if I overlooked the typos. The two characters are beyond stereotypical black women. All they do is spew out slang and two bit inside jokes that rarely make sense. This book was like acid for my eyes. I would give it negative stars if I could.
1,Terrible,"I was very frustrated with all the reviews I read about this book because they all gave the indication that it would be an excellent book. In fact, the book was probably the worst I have ever read. I honestly couldn't even get to the plot because the grammar and punctuation were so bad. There is a typo on the acknowledgement page, where the author dedicates the book to her ""ion-laws"" instead of her ""in-laws."" On the first page of the book, the author switches from writing in past tense to present tense and back again. The thing that really blew me away was that in the author bio, it says that she has her Masters Degree!!! Besides the grammar, all I really felt this book showed me about military life (and I am an army wife myself!) was that everyone sleeps around and has really screwed up lives. Not really much of an insight to someone wanting to learn more about military life. I highly DO NOT recommend buying (or even reading) this book."
1,Junk,"It's hard for me to believe this book was published. I could have overlooked the grammar problems and typos, which were numerous, but there was absolutely no substance whatsoever. There was also very little discussion of life as a military wife. I did the same as one of the earlier reviewers -- read the book and threw it in the trash."
1,Military Wives 101,"Being a military wife for 12 years I thought this would be a great book to read. Was I wrong. Our book club read this and we all came to an agreement, we would not recommend this book to anyone. If you are looking for an interesting book about military life this is not it."
1,Military Wives 101,"As a young, college educated woman married to an Army officer, I found this book to be an insult to military wives. The women were portrayed as promiscuous and materialistic...something that most military wives are NOT. Having been a military wife for over 7 years, I can say that this book does NOT even come close to describing a typical military life."
1,Not what I expected,This book is in no way what I expected. I read it then gave it away. Don't waste your money on this book. It reads like a crappy novel.
4,OK,"not wide enough for two small dogs unless you allow them to pee on one another, works ok for short walks"
4,Keeps my dog safely in my purse!,"Sometimes I take my toy poodle out. He thinks my purse is HIS travel bag.In order to be sure he doesn't jump out, I clip one side to the purse and the other clip goes on his harness.If he ever did jump out of my purse, he'd at least be swinging from my purse rather than injuring himself on the floor."
1,Scum.,"If this guy hasn't been murdered by now for releasing this album, it won't be long. You had no idea what you were doing did you? If you're not dead, or laid up in some hospital somewhere with a feeding tube down your throat, you must have a damn good hiding spot. An' if Mr. Zimmerman ever got a hold of you, he'd show you who has balls, an' rip yours right out of your crotch with his bare hands to the tune of the harmonica around his neck. Then he'll probably write a song about it. Chump."
4,My favorite watch,I have bought this same watch four times over the years. I like digital watches and this one also looks good and the price is right.
4,Fun retro men's watch,"This classic Timex keeps time well, looks pretty 80's and makes for a great retro dress watch. My son loves the look."
5,Fits well and just what I was looking for,This item was as expected and was received in Excellent shape and in a satisfactory amount of time and packaging.
4,Great watch,Purchased as a gift and love the watch but it was so hard to set the watch and directions were confusing.
2,interface problem,"I have a great fondness for Timex watches. They last a lot longer under the kind of wear and tear mine see than other brands I have tried.I have two problems with this model:1. It's a little too big for me (Timex no longer makes a ladies version of this watch, so I had to improvise).2. The hourly chime keeps getting turned on. I don't know how, the method for turning it off again is not obvious (especially without the manual), and there is no visual indication that it has been turned on."
3,"Nice watch, but not accurate enough","I like the style, convenience, and functions of this watch, and the band fits my wrist perfectly. However, this watch is not nearly as accurate as I would expect - off by over half a minute per month."
4,I like my new replacement Timex digital watch,"Rather than have a jeweler put in a new batter in my old Timex, I decided it was almost as cheap to buy a new watch. It's the exact duplicate of my old one, but it's new! It works very well, looks good, has a new battery, and I like it."
2,don't like it,"don't like it, is not the same as the sales description. i was expecting something better, oh well that's why is hard to order by internent."
2,sittin in the drawer,"Purchased this watch to replace an identical Timex quartz lithium which has a worn case, plating flaking off and a sharp bottom edge due to wear. Unfortunately. the newer model is considerably thicker than the one I'm wearing. Fearing it will catch on clothing and other inanimate object; it simply sits in a dresser drawer. When my existing watch dies, I'll try the new model. So far, I'm not exactly thrilled with this product."
3,it's a watch,"want I really wanted was the super-thin Armitron from this era, but they don't make those anymore. Shoulda bought a case of them from Consumer's Distributing back in the day I guess."
2,Date too Small and Unreadable,I liked a lot about this watch but the date is so small and shaded over by the tup that I could not see it. I just sent it to get something I could read.
2,D.O.A. had to return it,"Watch arrived in non - working condition . I did not give it one star because it rolled loosely around in box..though its a TIMEX and they should take a licking and keep on ticking. I liked the retro look in the watch and reminded me of a style watch I had when I was twenty . I have three high end watches already but this one looked like my 80's watch I got for graduation, although my 80's watch was Citizen...I ended up buying a Q&Q brand watch. The timex that I got may have been really an exception..usually Timex is reliable."
5,Nice to have a digital watch in gold,"It has been surprising to me, in this digital age, that all dress watches are analog. I had a gold Casio watch for many years, but when I tried to buy a new one a few years ago, I was unable to find anything like it. Following my unsuccessful search, i learned that ""they don't make them anymore."" So I was thrilled when I recently found the Timex that is exactly what I wanted. It arrived quickly and looks great."
4,Great Watch - so-so band.,"The watch lasts much longer than the watchband. I am on my 5th or 6th Timex watch of this same model over the last 10-12 years. It is the watch band that always fails and before that the plating on the back of the watch needs a protective covering (clear nail polish or JB Weld) to keep it from scratching a hole in your wrist. The watch itself usually lasts for about 5-6 years, a pocket watch or desktop timepiece after band failure. At the price, I can live with the band failure issue."
3,Timex Gold Watch,"It is a very nice watch. Small in size. I hope it captures others attention. Very lightweight. And it has an elastic band.Very fast shipping too. Its not the BEST, but it should do for now."
4,Back-to-the-Future (80s style),"Have had several Timex watches as ""everyday"" wear for many, many years. Always reliable and inexpensive. Plenty of sytle choices, too.I liked the ""retro"" look of this watch. I only gave it 4 out of 5 stars because I thought the display numbers could have been bolder.Works like a charm ... I especially like the ""Indeglo"" feature that lights the display when needed. This watch also has an alarm, if that's important to you."
3,Decent Watch--Little Small,"I got this watch as an ironic little fashion piece, originally for an 80s party. I've been wearing it daily for about three weeks, and I've noticed that the gold on the band is already fading pretty quickly and normal use has caused quite a few scratches to the face. I suppose you get what you pay for with a watch like this, but the other thing is the band is really tight. I'm a woman and my wrists aren't abnormally large, but I find myself needing to take it off because the band is so tight it actually becomes uncomfortable. I would take caution because of the tightness of the band. Otherwise, it's easy to use, settings and controls are pretty intuitive, and I love the indiglo light, it basically makes this watch :)"
3,my review,"I too know about this movie, because I was also an extra I played a police officer and later an dective.I became friends with Baltazar Getty in that short timemy picture is on the back of the vhs tape box I'm on the right wearing an hat looking at Kitt digging in the dirt,a grave he knew where he buried someone.so my experience was an great one, I also drove the classic green car to the located grave site. a veryinteresting two shooting days it was."
3,I was an extra in this movie; believe it or not!,"This movie was filmed in Tucson AZ in 1994, and I was an extra for the movie. It didn't do well at the box office and went straight to video. It starred Natalie Wood and Robert Wagener's daughter. This movie was loosely based on the true story of Charles Schmidt, the Pied Piper of Tucson, who killed several teenagers in the early 1960's including two daughters of a prominent Tucson doctor. At the time the movie was being made, I did not know this. You just showed up for your call time and did scenes out of order. I bought the movie (VHS)almost 10 years later, because I wanted to know what it was about; beginning to end. And of course wanted to see myself in the movie. It does have a sad ending, as did the real life story."
3,take it with a grain of salt,"If you like B-movies and artsy fartsy movies, this one is for you. Lets just say that it was funny without trying to be. one of those movies you need to not think too hard about and just accept it for how it is.Starring Balthazar Getty. First movie i ever saw with natasha gregorson wagner (she was in lost highway with Balthasar getty as well). Meredith Salanger (the actress form the 80's in Dream a little Dream with...). Sara Gilbert (Darlene from Roseanne) and the other lead guy whose name always escapes me, LOL. He is supposed to be the cool guy that everyone wants to befriend, but B.Getty was much cooler."
3,A good overview but...,"This book was a great general overview of George Washington's life. However, if you are looking for something a little more in depth, this book is not for you. It's only between 100-150 pages which is hardly enough to describe the complexity of Washington's character and all of what he accomplished as a founding father of America."
1,tedious and repetitive,"I found the George Washington book by Burns and Dunn to be tedious and repetitive. The first part of the book was interesting and covered the subject in an interesting and readable way; I'm surprised that the last few chapters made it into a book in this series. It was a struggle to finish it (I typically read more than 150 books a year without this problem).I feel that the writers were writing more for their own edification than to inform their readers. I you happen to pick up a copy read page 143 as a ""readability"" test. I am very surprised that the editors allowed this book to be published with the problems that I perceive.I've enjoyed other books that I've read in the ""The American Presidents Series""; don't let this review influence you on the whole series"
3,"Good for a brief introduction to Washington, nothing more","I suppose that this book is what should be expected from a 150-page biography of Washington: it serves as a good, brief introduction to the man, but not much more. The book is relatively shallow, and there appears to be little primary research, as the authors instead often refer to other historians' words and conclusions.If you are looking for a first read on Washington, this would probably serve you well. If, on the other hand, you have already read a fair amount about Washington and the Revolution, I wouldn't label this a ""must read."" (Don't get me wrong, though: it wouldn't be a waste of time / money, either.)"
3,Adequate though odd biography of a great president,Adequate biography of arguably the greatest of American presidents. The authors are a rather strange choice to write this biography. Burns is a FDR proponent of epic proporations and it is obvious that the 'Father of his country' does not measure up to Franklin 'president for life' Roosevelt. Some of the criticism raised about Washington's land deals and questions about his real motives are valid to a point but the constant sniping about Washington's lack of empathy for the common man is anachronistic at best.
5,Excellent book,"This book is part of the American Presidents series. As with all of these books, they are well wriiten and very informative about every stage of their lives not just the political. They also inlcude detail that I rarely see in other biographical books concerning the political machinations of their time."
5,An exellent tribute to Fats Waller...,"If only Fats Waller were still around to hear this loving tribute, he would truly be moved... Here Dick Hyman pays tribute to possibly the greatest stride pianist that ever lived Thomas ""Fats"" Waller, Hyman never copies Fats' style, Hyman makes the music his own, yet Fats' presents is definately here on this highly enjoyable session. This(& perhaphs Hyman's tribute to Duke Ellington) is his finest session, and you can definately say that Hyman is the Fats Waller of today. This CD should be aquired by all serious jazz fans."
3,c4am95,"this is obviously a must have for any champs fan, i bought III when it came out and it blew my mind. i even liked the kraftwerk-influenced tracks that were purposefully laid in between the metal-oozing rockers. i must say that this album isnt as interesting as III, but you should still check this out so that when you go see them live you will be able to look cool while you tap your feet and nod your head along with the complicated parts without looking like a poser!! the champs are WWWAAYY better live than on vinyl. when you do see them it will make you want to buy all of their stuff. they really are amazing and you can even tell when listening to this record."
3,Original is better,"This movie is good. But I have to say I much prefer the original Spanish version made in 1955. It has a much more simple story, straight to the heart. This Italian remake adds quite a bit that is completely unnecessary to the telling of an already wonderful story. Check out the original and I think you'll agree."
3,Miracle of Marcelino,"When I bought ""Miracle of Marcelino,"" I mistakenly thought I had bought the original ""Marcelino,Pan y Vino"" not a remake. I received not a very good copy of a remake. Nonetheless, I did receive the dvd in a short period of time, as Amazon almost always ships it in timely fashion."
3,Nice little movie,"Ive seen this movie as a small child many times and i knew there wassomething special about it. Now all grown up it its still a good littlemovie and after all these years, i now understand the ending better."
4,Like it,It's nice that the album insert includes lyrics in Gaelic (and the translation) so that you know what you're singing along to.
4,Short But Good,"I enjoyed this very much. I was looking forward to this coming out because Chan is a great author and I think he is a solid dude. Only thing that was bad was how short it was, but it definitely has the potential to spark conversation in a small group setting; which i think is the point of the video - in which case it serves its purpose."
3,Not the Cream of the Crop!,"While this type of album is certainly better than the ""self-stick"" magnetic albums and the pocket albums, it is not the best of the bunch! The posts make it a little hard to journal about the pictures because the book won't lie flat (which also makes some of the pictures pop off the page). And because it is top-loading dust, dirt, and water can get onto the pictures and scratch or ruin them. I took this one back and bought a Creative Memories album. Now they are the best!"
2,Really Unusual Bad Book,"At first, I thought this was 3 novella's, but it really isn't. It's one big book about 3 brothers from another world. And apparently people from Earth & their world pop back and forth occasionally. The theory is that you are so sad/miserable that you get to go to the other world for another chance. Lois (first human to pop over) commits suicide. Later she finds her mom there -- who did NOT commit suicide, and yet, there was a body, because Lois had buried her mom, but here she is on this other world -- hmmm, major plot flaw. Most of this book didn't seem thought out. And really just bad writing. The 3 men weren't interesting at all and fell so quickly in love with humans. It seemed like they loved the women because they were from another world -- the world their mother was from -- hmmm, Oedipus complex??? And these guys might have been unusual (oh yeah, they could transform into pumas) but in no way were they ""bad boys"". Maybe ""Really Unusual Boring Boys""."
1,This is the first and the last book by MJD I will read...,"Thank goodness I did not pay good money to read this book. I have been curious about MJD - I've heard great things about the Undead series, so when I was given the opportunity to read this book, I jumped at it. This book of short stories feels as if it were written by an immature child. Very simplistic text and sentence structures. I really felt like this was a first effort of a new writer and that an editor seriously should have taken this book in hand and not let it be published. I really saw nothing bad about these boys. The sex scenes were Meh at best and I didn't believe that any of the couples were really in love. I did not care one iota about the world that was supposedly being created in the stories and I found nothing endearing about the characters. Trust me - do not waste your time or your money on this book."
5,This is great stuff people.,"This is not high drama. It isn't Shakespeare or even Masterpiece Theatre. You didn't want that though. You wanted a funny, feisty heroine and hero's that are incredibly hot and great in bed. You wanted humor and sex and witty banter and believe me this book has all of that in spades. Ms. Davidson continually writes the best females in the genre. They are independant, imperfect, funny and vulnerable in unexpected ways. In other words, they are a lot like regular women. READ THIS BOOK."
5,"Real Men, that become Big Cats. Oh, MY!!",I really enjoyed these three stories about three brothers from another world. How they acquired their mates and the resulting actions were really unusual.
3,Old MJD stories,These are 3 short stories from Ellora's Cave e-publisher from several years ago put into print. The stories are ok but not what you expect from MJD nowadays.
1,A Really BAD Book,"I really enjoy MJD's Vampire series, which is why I purchsed this book. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. This is very poorly written, probably in a few days. The main character of the first story is obnoxious and unlikable. The sex scenes don't seem as if a woman wrote them at all. The plot lines are thin. All in all the worst book I have read in many years. If I could give this zero stars I would."
4,Alot of fun,"I always love Mary Janice Davidson no matter what she writes. These short stories are fun, her women are not pathetic and the guys aren't bad either. Enjoy!"
4,Greatest hits and more!,"Somehow the Hi Record label has fared rather better in terms of re-releases in Europe than in the US.This CD contains a slew of Peebles classics like ""Feel like breakin' up somebody's home"", ""I can't stand the rain"" and I'm gonna tear your playhouse down"" as well as some that were only ever album cuts. She does a great version of Bobby Bland's ""I pity the fool"" and Oliver Sain's ""Walk away"". The vocals and arrangements are never less than powerful, even when some of the material is not of the highest quality. A good CD to start with, but my reservations are because the sleeve notes are no more than perfunctory,listing the names of the Hi house band, two co-producers with Wille Mitchell and including a couple of (good) photographs from the Colin Escott archive. A collection this good deserves to have the kind of full liner notes that (for example)Rhino records do so well, and in so much detail."
1,red tail reborn,I was looking for a movie. Didn't care for what I rec'd. I'll have to pay more attention for the next dvd's that I order.
1,I returned it,"My vcr does not accept Blu-Ray so I returned the video. Later I found it was not what I expected. I want the movie "" red Tail's"" when it becomes available."
5,Murray Perahia is a Schubertian the equal of Kempff and Lupu,"I am a big fan of Murray Perahia. I have quite a number of his recordings in my collection. His recordings of the Schubert Impromptus and this collection of the Posthumous Sonatas are wonderful examples of his art.His interpretations have the healthy outlook and vibrant life force of Artur Rubinstein; yet have the vision of Artur Schnabel. He really is a perfect pianist. (If there is such a thing).If your'e reading this Mr. Perahia, please do us all a favor, and give consideration to recording all of the complete Schubert Sonatas. It would be a great set!!!"
2,Did nothing for me,Guess this product is for a much younger woman. I read some reviews and they were positive but they did not mention there age. That is why 2 stars.
3,Average product,I have used this product off and on for a few years and don't really see a big improvement. Just ok in my estimation.
3,Just OK for me,"I don't really like or dislike this product. I'm in my early 40's & tried this when I noticed some softening along my jawline however, it didn't make any noticeable difference. It a fine lightweight moisturizer & I like the smell but there is nothing exceptional about it & it doesn't do what it says it does. At least, it didn't for me"
5,Great compilation of Otis,"This album/CD is one of the great blues collections. Features Muddy Waters and James Cotton as well as Otis's early drummer S.P Leary on several cuts, but it's all Otis. At first thought this was a bootleg album, with lousy mixing (which it has!)on live cuts.But this is the real deal and gives you a good feel for Spann's artistry both as soloist and dynamite side piano for Muddy. After listening 2 or 3 times, I think this is probably the best Otis Spann album. You'll want more, but its all here. Won't drive my car without it!"
4,A good book,"To tell the true, I expected a little more...every serious Karate black belt who works bunkai, should know the content of that book. And if has also another background (Judo, Jiu Jitsu, Ryu Kyu Kempo, etc.) maybe he doesn't find anything really new ...It could be more detailed, covering more Kata situations. I think this is just a beginner book, but is a good one!Anyway is a good book and I enjoyed it."
5,Unbelievable Value,"I compared prices at at least two dozen stores and I saved at least 200 dollars on this item. Additionally, I had it engraved. If you do so, you will need to remove the band at the base of the watch head and then have it professionally reattached."
5,beautiful watch,"This is a great watch. Paid $100, much less than price in local retail store. Exactly as described on Amazon. Arrived in 2 days. Extremely satisfied."
1,ORDINARY,"This product did NOT live up to it's promo's. It felt cool and tingling, but did nothing to the appearance of my eyes. It was definitely not worth it's high cost. I would never buy it again nor would I recommend it to anyone!"
5,Worked as expected,"The brackets were packaged well, arrived in good condition, worked as expected. Well worth the money. Would purchase other roof products from this manufacturer."
1,"You owe me 4 brackets, ship ASAP!","Do you see the title of this product? The last phrase is 3 pack. I recieved 2 boxes, 1 bracket in each box. Again, you owe me 4 brackets, ship ASAP!"
5,"Guitar, Sax, and Piano Winterlude are also GREAT!!","I first heard ""Winterlude"" while getting physical therapy during the holidays of 1996. My husband and I were in an auto accident in November, and this music really helped to ease my pain during PT. I found the title of CD, and went and bought them all. ""Winterlude"" and ""Guitar Winterlude"" are my favs, but the others are just as great. If you find them for sale, buy them. They are very difficult to find. Happy Holidays to all, and be safe!!"
5,The Best,This has got to be the very best easy listening Christmas Disc I have ever heard. I can have it on all day and never get tired of it. It's just absolutely peaceful - not harsh or abrasive at all. Perfect music for a quiet Christmas Dinner Party!
5,Calming music for Christmas,"This instrumental recording is my favorite. Now that I know it is the one I want, I am returning to order more for gifts.With a cup of hot chocolate and an easy chair, the perfect music for cuddling and looking at the Christmas lights."
5,best xmas music,"I absolutely love this CD. I kind of ""stumbled"" upon this while Christmas shopping about 10 years ago. I love this one so much I had it played as quiet music before my wedding (which was obviously in December). If you like quiet/meditation music for the holidays or it works very well for background music at a Christmas party, I highly recommend this CD."
5,The greatest reggae band of all time,"If you are looking for a reggae album with awesome talent and incredible upbeat songs, this would have to be it. All of the band's best hits are on here. The inspiration and feeling that Steel Pulse puts forth is nearly unrivaled."
5,Wonderfully soothing tea,I love chai tea and this is definitely reminiscent of that. It's got a wonderful aroma and tastes good hot or cold. I'm definitely buying it again. It also reminds me of special home-made tea I had at a NYC Indian restaurant which was fabulous. Excellent tea. Well worth the price!
5,The BEST recording of Candide.,This is an American Classic...fantastic score performed by the original cast. Can't be beat! Should be in the collection of everyone who enjoys American musical theatre - and opera.
2,candid on Candide,"An uneven disk. Some parts are very good, but much of the story line is absent and the tension expected between the fuzzy headed romantic thoughts of some characters and the devious real world does not happen. It seems diluted and while better than the Soundheim stuff of later years is still not at the level expected for this work."
1,Bait and switch,"Be careful before ordering - you don't get the bottle of Loctite pictured, you just get a little sample tube. Rip-off!!"
5,great purchase,"It was exactly what I thought it would be, and shipping was fast. I was very pleased with my purchase. It is a great addition to my classroom."
2,paint by questionable numbers,"This is my first experience with a paint by number kit so I have nothing to compare it to, but I do have two concerns. There are many number errors on both the painting surface and the cardboard box as well (ie: different numbers on the same location, paint numbers that don't exist in this kit). Secondly, some of the lighter paint colors (white especially) don't cover the pattern lines or numbers well. I've applied a second coat, but that gets tiring. I guess the solution is to always view the painting from a safe distance!"
5,Loved this.,"In my opinion Eileen Farrell was in a class all her own. She was the first great opera diva to cross over into Pop and do it with an incredible ease. Beautiful operatic voice and honey smooth pop voice. Wow, what a power house she was."
3,Very detailed reading,"A very comprehensive volume dealing with all aspects of molecular methods in ecology and evolution. However, I would NOT recommend this book to individuals with little or no background in population genetics and/or molecular phylogenetics. The author assumes the reader has the basic knowledge in these disciplines and does not discuss introductory concepts. I also find the style of writing to be more complex than necessary."
1,I bought the large and received the small.,This is useless if they are not going to send the right size that was ordered. I have 100 pound lab and order the large size but instead received the small; a complete waste of money.
2,Creepy in a Bad Way,"Why are cable documentaries so inferior to PBS documentaries?Every aspect of this documentary is second-rate - from the soundtrack to the stock footage to the writing. In the first episode, mummy footage is non-stop and disgusting. Actor voice-overs of Egyptian cult texts are creepy, often poorly placed, and outright maddening. The writing wanders all over the place and jumbles up the history of ancient Egypt into a mass of hyperbole and useless trivia - it's practically impossible to follow as coherent history.For teachers, do not buy this for your classes - no child or teenager with even the vaguest hint of ADD will want to watch this for more than 30 seconds.After the first few screenings, I like to have documentaries as background noise while I'm doing busy work at home. I can't even stand 15 minutes of 'Mummies' as background noise. I've given it two stars because it has SOME value historically."
1,15 minutes long :-(,Way overpriced considering it is only 15 mins long and not 40 as advertised. It's not even very interesting either.
1,20/20 Hoarders,"What a rip off! This is an extremely short, bland segment on hoarding. Not worth the money at all. Big disappointment."
1,It used to be great!,"I have used this video in my classroom before, it was marveluos in it's original productiom. Now it has more information added throughout. It is complicated hard to follow and an informational overload. I was very dissapointed."
5,Greatest Airplane CD Ever,This has to be the best airplane song CD ever. Just waiting for the sequel.
5,"It's LORA Roberts, and she has penned a great mystery!","Liz Sullivan is homeless and on the run from her abusive ex-husband. While she parks her minibus in a Palo Alta neighborhood for a night's rest, someone stuffs the dead body of another homeless acquitance under her van. Soon Liz is the main suspect of Detective Paul Drake and when another homeless person becomes a victim, she may not only be the main suspect but could possible be the next victim.I truly enjoyed this book and plan on reading the next one in the series: Murder in the Marketplace. The characters are interesting and the writing was tight and entertaining. If you're a gardening person, or not a gardening person like me who is trying it, it contains some subtle hints on gardening.This book was written in 1994 and it's amazing how strong the social issues covered in this book are still main issues today: homelessness, abusive relationships, and senior citizen issues. The dialogue is real and it's fast paced. Great little book."
2,Tape is not great quality,"Used this to create archival folders. When I checked on the folders the next day, the sides of the folders were not being held together by the tape. Save your money and get a different product."
1,Can't peel off the backing,I have been struggling with this stuff - I cannot get the backing to come off easily. What a pain. Maybe I have a defective roll . . . I'm going to take it back and get glue or something easier to work with.
3,Good introduction for laypersons,"""Principles and Practice of Phytotherapy"" is a good general introduction to herbal medicine for laypersons looking to incorporate herbs into their family's healthcare. The authors have concocted a rather obtuse ""philosophy"" of herbal medicine in an attempt to appropriate and justify the philosophies behind all schools of traditional herbalism. Otherwise this text is straightforward and simple to use. Includes information on 45 useful herbs, a managable amount of information for laypersons just starting out in herbalism.Physicians, nurse practitioners and other health care professionals with an interest in phytotherapy will find ""Herbal Medicine"" by Weiss and Fintelman or ""Rational Phytothrapy"" by Schulz, et al more useful for practice."
4,high lift jack,Jack does exactly what I expected. The clamp on the handle could be a little stronger as the handle will come unclamped and fall when the jack is being moved. I have an old high lift jack and this newer model is definitely better.
2,this is NOT hi-lift brand,this is an ok jack but cheaper made than hi-lifttitle is misleading on purpose this is NOT hi-lift brand
1,Seiko is not what it used to be,"I have owned a couple Seiko watches over the years, but this will be the last one. Within a couple weeks of receiving the watch, the stainless steel wrist band came apart. Really inferior quality control. I guess that's why the watch was so inexpensive; I should have known better - now I do!"
4,"Good price, good looking, not so good watch band","I purchased this watch as a gift for my then early-teenage son. I thought it was a good price for a Seiko, and it turned out to be good looking, too. We have had a lot of problems with the band, however, having to make numerous trips to the local jeweler for replacement pins. Apparently it can only hold a more delicate pin, and they bend easily, causing the band to separate from the watch. The cost of purchasing quite a few replacement pins and the hassle of trips to the jeweler take away from the benefit of the low purchase price."
5,Good experience with Seiko watches.,This my third Seiko watch over the last ten plus years and I have to say the quality is great. This model of Seiko is one of the nicest designed I have purchased and easy to read the time in a dark environment. The only problem I had was adjusting the band as I needed to take the watch to the our local jewelry store to correct what I had taken apart.
3,"Worth buying, if only for ""Eternally Fried.""","""Egoverride"" is a great song, but you can get it off the album. Let's face it: the only reason to buy singles is for the b-sides. And, as always, just because Bob left it of the LP doesn't mean it's not worth listening to. ""Wanted Was"" is pretty good, with a typical Mouldian sound, but compared to a lot of his other stuff its nothing to write home about. ""Doubleface"" is kind of wierd; it doesn't even sound like him. But the shining track here is ""Eternally Fried."" With several layers of guitars and vocals--the trademark twelve-string standing above the rest--not to mention some down-right chilling lyrics, this song kicks some serious booty. And you should see him do it live."
1,Great taste but MOLDY!,"These are great crusts, but when I received the shipment, 2 crusts were molded. Amazon gave me a credit for those 2 crusts, but then more began to mold. The expiration date was still months away, and more than half of the box of crusts were molded. Amazon told me (a) too late to give me a credit, or (b) I could return the molded crusts at my expense to get a refund. Sadly, the crusts ended up costing me 2x more than expected because only 1/2 of them were edible, and I will not order these again due to the mold and inability to get an adjustment."
2,CAN BUY BETTER AT LOWES/HOME DEPOT,DIFFICULT TO PUT TOGETHER; wires not on one side very well; cheap in every detail...if it lasts this season I'll be surprised !
3,A night at a rowdy pub,"I think this CD is not given enough credit. Imagine sitting down at a pub for an evening and having the Oyster's as the featured entertainment. That is what this CD basically is. Featuring songs and tunes not on any other CD, this is what the band sounds like live. One particular favorite is ""the Red Barn Stomp"", a fun little instrumental. This is not a great CD, but its not too bad though. You cannot beat the cut-out price on this one, buy it."
3,"Nice music, Annie Lennox song not included...","Nice background music, although the soundtrack is short and does not include the end credit song by Annie Lennox (""Waiting in Vain""). If you're primarily interested the Annie Lennox song, it can be found in her Medusa album - available used on Amazon.com for under $5.00."
4,Great soundtrack,"While watching the movie on the big screen, I remember saying how... infectious the score had been. However... I have but two regrets: The disc was cheated by the lack of Annie Lennox's closing song; and two: The disc is only a modest 39 minutes in comparison to a two-hour film.This soundtrack possesses great perks. It's WONDERFUL background music.I'm looking forward for Mr. Arnold's future work. He's got it in him...."
3,Mosaic Workshop : A Guide to Designing and Creating Mosaics,"If you want to learn about mosaic, this is a good book. Many ilustrations help you to understand how easy is create a mosaic."
5,good belt,Shop around for a belt th was cheaper than GM. Happy with purchase. Very good belt. No issues and a lot cheaper than GM prices.
4,Close to perfect!,"Since my cd player in my car is broken, I'm limited to listening to a little cd player at my desk at work. Listening to this cd set along with the the first set in the series makes my days at work go much more quickly, and I find that while my focus is still on work, the praise through the music I hear all the time is a wonderful encouragement to always perform at my best, go above and beyond, and remember who I'm truly working for. I hope to collect this entire series of cds. It will be even better when my car cd player is fixed - then I can sing along at the top of my lungs during my commutes!"
4,Their best album in years,"Solid throughout. It rocks. It has roots. It probably doesn't break new ground but it does go through most of everything they do best and the songs all sound fresh and compelling. In the spirit of Kiko, Colossal Head, the Latin Playboys and the first Super Seven collaboration with a dash of Will the Wolf Survive. If you like those albums, you'll like this album, too."
2,Just not Trying!,"I have been a fan of Los Lobos for over twenty years. The music has always inspired. This latest release, however, not only was uninspiring but I had a hard time staying awake through it. It has some lyrical moments that prevent me from giving it less than two stars but lacks any of the power and excitement of previous recordings. It just sounded old and tired, like they just weren't trying. If you have bought this disappointment and want to give them another try, I would suggest Good Morning Aztlan or one of my personal favorites, Colossal Head."
2,Tired of the same old thing,"Don't get me wrong, I love Los Lobos. I just think this theme of Mexican-American victimization has gotten old after about 10 albums and the music on this cd illustrates my point. There are a few good songs, including, ""The road to Gila Bend"", but by in large, the cd drags and puts you to sleep after a few listens. Check out ""Kiko"" and ""Collosal Head"" or ""The Neighborhood"" for classic Los Lobos or any of the Latin Playboy discs. Los Lobos is one of the premier American bands, but this is not one of their better efforts."
4,LOS LOBOS: THE TOWN AND THE CITY,"This album is a return to the ""Kiko"" era Los Lobos, and finds them in a reflective mood for many of the tracks. On each successive listening, I find this album to be a real ""grower"", and one that very gradually works it's way into your musical consciousness.They are playing the studio like an instrument, and seem to be really enjoying the whole creative process. There are no out and out rockers here, but some songs which will doubtless grow and evolve as the band play them live. Cesar Rosas keeps on producing quality Mexicano party vibes, and the Hidalgo/Perez writing team continue to produce quality songs.I still feel that I haven't yet plumbed the depths of this record, and look forward to what new delights are in store with each listening."
5,woodshaver 90,"I HAVE BEEN A CONTRACTOR FOR 30 YRS AND I COULDN'T DO MY JOB WITHOUT THESE STAGINGS PLANKS . I HAVE A 20"" AND A 12"" BOTH 20' LONG WITH THE QUALCRAFT ALUMINUM PUMP JACKS AND QUALCRAFT LADDER JACKS.WITH THIS SYSTEM I CAN HANDLE ALMOST ANY SITUATION AND SET UP IN MINUTES.IT IS FANTASTIC TO BE ABLE TO WALK 20' OVER BUSHES AND GARDENS WITHOUT DISTURBING ANYTHING.THESE PLANKS ARE INCREDABLY STRONG AND HOLD MUCH MORE THAN THE RATED 500 POUNDS.I AM ABLE TO LIFT THESE PLANKS BUY MY SELF BUT I DRAG THEM ALOT.I HAVE REALLY FOUND THE 12"" WIDE PLANK MORE VERSITAL ON LOWER SECTIONS BECAUSE IT FITS MY LADDER JACKS AND I USE IT AS MY WORKING PLATFORM IN COMBINATION WITH MY 20"" PLANK UP HIGH. PLUS HOW CAN YOU BEAT FREE SHIPPING ON THESE BABIES. I AM ABOUT TO PICK UP ANOTHER SET SO I CAN GO 40 FT AT A TIME. YOU WILL PAY FOR THIS SYSTEM WITH THE FIRST JOB IN LABOR COSTS ALONE AND WORK LIKE A GENTLEMAN."
1,AMAZON STINKS,"LATE, DAMAGED and 20 hours trying to get CREDIT BACK! I went to LOWES and bought one at the same price. I won't buy from AMAZON again. POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!"
3,Not too bad but with a major drawback.....,"I bought this in my grocery store because it was at a drasticallly reduced price, so I decided to give it a try. As a moisturizer, it's not bad at all. The only major drawback is the smell. It smells almost like Raid. Other than that, it does moisturize well. It takes a few minutes for the smell to go away."
3,Long neck Dragon,"I am basically pleased with the dragon and its fierce red eyes, but I thought from the picture that the eyes were blue. Also, the receiver blank is so long that there is more than two inches of extension from the receiver before your reach the dragon. Not a problem, as long as you make sure to be careful when you park to pull forward a little further so that the person parking behind you or the descending garage door doesn't decapitate your dragon."
4,I Get It Out Every Year,"I bought a cassette of this several years ago at Walmart. All of the tunes are very well done. The companion album Light Jazz Christmas Eve is good too. I recorded both of them onto CD,so I can enjoy them forever."
5,Simply the best!!!,This is by far the greatest Christmas CD of all time!! I've had in on cassette for years and now I'm going to get it on CD so it will last forever!!
4,Very enriching discoveries,"Drs. Hicks and Taylor have put together a very thorough and enriching study of the biblical background and meaning of Christian baptism. You will find that baptism is a mosaic of images and plays a vital role in propelling our lives into God's transforming work. Those whose traditions have underemphasized baptism will gain new insights and appreciation for the part that baptism plays in conversion--a moment in which God works powerfully through faith. Those who have seen it as a legality will be drawn into the deeper, ongoing significance of it rich undercurrents for their lives. This study delves into the biblical teachings in depth. Yet it also speaks practically to our preconceptions from the standpoint of various church traditions and their roots in history. Unafraid to address the real issues that are raised, Hicks and Taylor make this book a valuable resource for any serious disciple of Jesus."
4,Down in the River to Pray,"As a former member of a Stone/Cambell church that believed a person was going to hell if the minister didn't say the act was for the remission of sins when a person was baptized, it was refreshing to read such an historically informed book on baptism from a writer of this traditon. Acknowledging the long traditon of infant baptism in the church dating to the third, fourth and fifth centuries, Hicks gives the history and application of baptismal theology of the churches before and after the Reformation. Hicks urges a rejection of the Zwinglian view of baptism in favor of the Reformed view in the credobaptist tradtion, saying baptism is God's work, not mans'. Hopefully, this book is an indication that the Christian Churches/Churches of Christ are finally beginning to form a less works oriented and non-sectarian baptismal theology and are beginning to rethink the exteme view that they are the only true church."
4,Quality read,It's a good review of baptism and it's whole context. Another (less easy reading) book would be 'Christians Only'.
4,Great music for young and old.,"Love the music, and the beat. I bought this for my 14 y/o son who is the drummer in the family. He loves it, as well as the whole family."
2,False History,the claim that the mickey hart project set the standard for world music is wrong. the standard was set 11 years after olatunji's ground breaking album of 1960 by osibisa in their self title dubut in 1971 and also fela's live album with ginger baker also in 1971. please tell true history not a fabricated opinion
2,Pretty Boring,"This is the first CD of all percussion I have ever bought, and it'll prolly be my last. An album of all percussion is, frankly, pretty boring. Much more interesting to hear percussion-heavy *music* such as, say, Peter Gabriel. ""The Hunt"" and ""The Dancing Sorcerer"" are ok, but even at its best, this album is background noise."
3,"Some Successful Experiments, But Not a Cohesive Album","In this concept album, Hart brings great drummers from around the world to participate. The result is wholly new works that are without question novel, but this record has not fared well in my collection since I bought it four years ago. I find myself choosing traditional Brazilian or Latin American or Indian or Middle Eastern performances rather than Planet Drum. I would especially warn potential buyers that Planet Drum is not a survey of percussion styles that will help you decide what you do and do not like. It is instead outside all the mainstream styles and I would consider it the kind of album that would augment a percussion collection rather than start one."
4,Little Dancer 3 Piece,This outfit is adorable. My daughter wore it yesterday for Valentine's Day. Good fit. Good quality and proportion for the money.
4,Not for the beginner,"Very difficult. Not for the beginner. I have been practicing Bikram Yoga for over 7 years, and decided to try a different yoga. This was very fast paced and the poses were much different than Bikram Yoga. If you are looking for a change, start out with a beginner yoga video and then work your way up to this video."
5,Great challenging workout,"This workout is divided into ""seasons"" so that you can chose short segments (about 12 minutes each) instead of doing the whole workout. This is good for me because I cannot do more than 2 seasons at once! I work up a good sweat, and I was happy to see that the instructor was too. My goal is to get into good enough shape that I can do the whole DVD all at once.Music is gentle; direction is pleasant and direct.I was originally bothered by the lack of modesty in the instructors' appearance, but I just get so busing trying to follow the intense workout that I don't have much time to look at them, other than to glance up to make sure I am doing the pose correctly.Definitely not for beginners or people who have a problem getting into all the stretches and bends. There are still a few poses that I still can't get, but I see that the more I do the DVD the better I get at it."
3,Great yoga dvd but poor cueing,"Lovely cinematography, I enjoy the practice itself and feel fantastic at the end and I also appreciate some of the more challenging moves introduced here.However the cueing is out of time and poses are somewhat rushed in places. I also find that some of the stretching in the lunar sequence is not held long enough to give you any real benefit.I reccommend this dvd for someone who would like some fresh ideas for their practice and a bit of a challenge but be prepared to be dissatisfied with the cueing and find the need to rewind or pause the dvd."
3,ok-but too fast and stylized,"Everyone loves this DVD because of the production values, but I found the set and sweaty women a little intimidating. The yoga teachers had wonderful form, but it felt as if they were saying look what we can do and look what you cannot do. I have other yoga DVDs with wonderful instructors dressed similarly, but for some reason I felt like I was watching soft porn during this DVD. Maybe these teachers and Bryan Kest can get together and do a soft porn yoga DVD. The class itself moves too fast and the cueing is awful. It also has a weird sequencing to the poses. If you are looking for a more advanced DVD, you probably will like this one because there are many difficult poses, and if you are a guy who wants to see beautiful, hot, sweaty women bending over backwards, you should also give this DVD a try."
3,yoga for acrobats,"This yoga practice is hard! It goes through the four seasons. Summer is very difficult. If you can't stand on your head, hold yourself in the air with one arm etc...... then you will be left watching the dvd in frustration. The girls in the dvd have perfect figures and make me feel like a blimp who can't do the splits.I personally didn't love it. The music and setting is very beautiful though.I thought I was a bit of a yogi but after this dvd I feel pathetic."
5,Book of Changes and the Unchanging Truth by Hua Ching Ni,"great book (!!!) - i've Many i-ching interpretations but this book is like ""the i-ching bible"" (lol) - simply a MUST have in your collection if you take i-ching divination and spiritual cultivation seriously...also - i received this item on time and in excellent condition~i.(IAYAALIS)"
1,This Book is different and appears to be inaccurate.,"Besides being way overpriced this book is inacurate and I feel there are much, much better books out there that cover this subject correctly."
3,nice but too big for cats,"Not really what I expected. The bowl is very heavy and a little too big to use as a cat bowl. Very cute print though, so perfect for a small dog."
2,Lost your mojo?,"What have they done? The first two albums from Suicide, THE avant-garde raw-electronic pop-billy act, are complete masterpieces. But 15 years later, the duo seems not so inspired. Alan Vega put his fantastic vocals on the so cheesy melodies of Martin Rev. Ugh.... anyway, buy all albums from Suicide, except this one."
5,Not just Keith Haring and Jean-Michel Basquiat...,"This book changed my life as an artist. I picked it up the paperback version of this in the late 80's when it was first published and it shaped the style of art I do today.My favorite person in this book is still relatively unheard of: Kenny Sharf. Many of the artists are unknowns, and that is what I like about this book. It's nice to hear about artists other than the standard Andy Warhols. It talks about graffiti art, punk art, the clubs (CBGBs, Club 57, Mudd Club), the music (the Ramones, Klaus Nomi, Television to name a few), the parties (Lydia Lunch, Ann Magnuson, the Fun Gallery)...the whole art scene in the East Village during the 70s and 80s. Most of the illustrations are in black and white (at least in the paperback), which is a shame because I bet the artwork is better represented in color.Great read!"
1,bucket boss leather knee pads,"The single strap on the knee pads were too damn short to go around my knee. The wife tried them on too , at 150lbs, it barely fit around her bare leg, let alone a guy wearing jeans. Sent them back without any problems &they took care of return shipping costs."
3,Standard Catalog of Jeep,"The book was good, but it did not cover all the jeeps :0(, I expected this to cover all the jeeps ever built, but it completely missed the 2.4 litre and 2.7 litre diesel CJ5's, CJ7's, & CJ8's that were built in Ohio for export.I also felt that some jeeps did not get full coverage and some of the original sales brochures told you more about them.A great piece of work, but should not be sold as covering every jeep ever built."
5,Ewan can croon !!!,"All I an say about this is that Ewan is one amazing singer who has such a fantastic voice, that he can have a great career asa singer is he wants it. But we already knew that from Moulin Rouge, and actually got a peek in 4 other early films of his ...he alone has the power in his hands to bring back the old musical genre as it deserves to be. No other entertainer today has that COMPLETE package of singing, acting, dancing ability that he has and he can do anything in the world he wants with it. This guy is a grand entertainer on a scale of a Gene Kelly or a Frank Sinatra ....I am shocked by his abilities.Anyway great movie, great soundtrack, and if you've got a soul, you will be moved by the first and last songs ! Enjoy."
5,Down With Love Soundtrack,"I think that this is a great soundtrack to buy. It features great classic songs that are still great even today!! When you have a soundtrack with Ewan and Renee, what could possibly go wrong??"
4,Thinking Outside of the Box,This book provides a good jolt to the creative juices and provides the framework to spark innovation. This one needs to be on your reading list.
2,disappointing,"One of my favorite movies, and I cannot watch it because it is not close captioned..I need captioning because I am deaf"
5,For the love of Grace,Had watched on TV. Good story. Good for Family Night at the Movies. Purchased fromAmazon. Feel good movie. Love Mark
3,For the love of Grace,"LIked the dvd but it has no captions. For us hearing impaired this is just awful, we cannot hear what is going on, just have to watch the action. sigh! I would have liked to have known before I purchased this , that it had captions."
4,Book,Good book. Read it awhile ago so can't remember specific. But had a good story line and would recommend this book.
3,Somewhat Unsatisfied,very convenient but i have found that often the adhesive is not very effective; i typically use these for scrapbooking and use four squares per picture and often the pictures don't stick well to the cardstock/background unless pressed down for an extended period of time; i often worry if the adhesive will hold the pictures for more than a few months
4,sticky photos,We printed pictures on them and stuck them in various places. They're still there. The paper quality is fair for photo printing and the adhesive is... well... sticky.
1,Do not buy for study,"If you want to use this for study (reading while typing, etc) it is horrible. It is not big enough for my statistics book which is smaller than the average cookbook. It is not a natural setup. I'm not sure of how to explain other than to say using it compares to trying to open your car door with your back facing it; it's easy to do but much easier if you just turn around.I recommend this item: Office Depot Premium Book/Copy Holder it is only $8.99 at Office Depot and has a great page holder and set's up quick. It's great for all college text books and even over sized books."
3,Book Holder,"Portable Book HolderThis is a good product, but my wife is not able to use it. She is partially paralyzed on her left side and cannot handle the device and turn pages."
2,Book holder,"Doesn't quite work for Seniors (my Mother is 84), the initial ad showed it used by someone lying on their back but when she received it the instructions said to use it on a table or side of the bed."
4,No complaints,I've been using this product for about month and I have no complaints. It works as advertised and met my expectations.
2,Half Good,"The advice that other readers give to just skip the stuff between pages 73 and 173, or to save it for a very rainy day, is good advice. That section of the book is terrible; bad writing in the service of who-knows-what concept. It's disjointed nonsense. Dick should have thrown it away.The rest of the book, the original novella, is pretty good pulp sci-fi."
2,All messed up,Some good writing here but the story is all messed up. If you know the history of how this book was written you can understand why it makes very little sense. Half the book is just not worth reading. I had to struggle to get to the end and was happy it was over.
4,History of Lies,"It's not too surprising that the story seems a bit disjoint, as though it was written in two seperate pieces... it was. Check out this review for details on the history.http://www.sfsite.com/05b/li176.htm"
1,Wayyyyy out of date,"It was no doubt great when it was published three years ago but time, and the Garage Band software, have moved on. This book has not."
2,Complicated,I was just looking for a book that would tell me the basics! How to turn it on record save and turn it off. This isn't that book!
4,Invigorating,"With all the fuss being made over young, photogenic pianists today, it is good to have this memento of Leif Ove Andsnes from the beginning of his career. There is no doubt in listening to this that, unlike some more recent artists, Andsnes had the goods right from the start. His approach to Chopin is vigorous and full of excitement. Tempos in No. 2 are a little on the fast side, less so in No. 3. Andsnes could not be confused with an older generation of pianists whose interpretations of these works was more overtly Romantic. He makes more sense of the last movement of No. 2 than just about anyone I've heard, and the lyrical elements in the first movement of No. 3 are not slighted in the least. His piano tone, whether from his own doing or the sound engineers', is somewhat brittle at times, emphasizing the impression of youthful vigor and rigor. This would be a welcome addition to anyone's Chopin collection. I also like budget priced recordings by Jerome Rose and Cecile Ousset."
3,Could have been perfect.......,"This would have been almost 100% perfect if they had used the original versions, instead of using remixes of alot of his biggest & best songs. As it is, it's only rates a 6 on a scale of 10. What a wasted oppurtunity!"
2,Makes me want to buy all his old albums!,"So I had to spend [money] to realize that I really just need to own all his albums released through 1980 plus ""Pride"" from 1983. I already own ""Double Fun,"" so six more to go!The remixes on this CD are criminal. Some of my most beloved songs like ""Give Me an Inch,"" ""You Are In My System,"" and ""Looking for Clues"" are sullied by really awful production. And who thought it was a good idea to end the Sailin' Shoes/Julia/Sally trilogy with that live version? Really hurts my ears.I really don't understand why this album features remixes instead of originals -- perhaps it fulfilled some record contract obligation of ""new"" material?"
3,Robert Palmer,"This collection is good .From the stand point your not going to get any betterthan this, even though this is Islands 50yr anniversayI would think they might come out with better anthology?But since Robert, is no alonger alive.Don't bet on it. It would be nice; if Island would reissueall robert's cds ?If you really want to get into robert palmersmusic. I would suggest just buying most of cd'swhich are quite affordable.Except say 3-4 of them three can be found?on well known auction site and sister site U.K fleabay& half.com ."
2,Disappointed,"I love Robert Palmer and decided I needed a greatest hits album. This looked to fit the bill by having his earlier music with the later work. It was a little pricier, but I thought I would at least have everything I wanted. Listening to the album was disappointing - someone decided that rather than use the original songs, they have several ""remixes"" - and the remixes all happen to be the more popular hits. Not exactly sure what they were thinking. Actually, I wish I could return this CD and start the search over again (even if I have to purchase 2 albums to get what I want)."
2,"OVERKILL! Get the single disc ""The Very Best Of...""","OK. I'm a casual Robert Palmer fan. That means I want his hits, all of them, and not a hodgepodge of album tracks and other esoterica. I can't take RP in large doses, but I like quite a few of his songs. All his best songs (including ""Dr. Dr,"" ""Every Kinda People,"" and the 2 Power Station hits are on the single disc ""The Very Best of Robert Palmer."" That's all I need and if you're a casual fan, it's probably all you need."
4,MELLOW WORLD MUSIC,"THIS CD IS A GREAT WINDOW TO HELP YOU RELAX. I LIKE TO LISTEN TO THIS MUSIC WHEN I AM HOME WORKING ON MY COMPUTER, IT IS NOT TOO INTRUSIVE, YET VERY MELODIC. AS ONE OF THE OTHER REVIEWERS WROTE, AT TIMES IT DOES SOUND A BIT MIDDLE EASTERN, BUT I AM NOT FAMILIAR ENOUGH WITH THE MUSIC OF NORTHERN SUMATRA TO REALLY MAKE THAT KIND OF JUDGEMENT CALL. BUT I LIKE IT."
4,An Awesome Anthology,"Save yourself the expense of buying all those early CDs from Mickey Hart and RYKOdisk's ""The World"" series. The best of it is all concentrated in this wonderful (and very inexpensive!) anthology.Lots of surprises, and I challenge you not to get up and dance to Diga Rhythm Band's ""Sweet Sixteen""."
2,Fluke holster,"I received it promptly. However, I feel the material used was not the best quality. It only has one snap to hold it on and it fell off my belt twice the first time I used it. I would have liked a holster that totally covers my Fluke Voltage tester to protect the leads better. I ended up using it , but having my wife sew in velcro to assist in keeping it on my belt and I super glued the snap. I don't like dropping testers."
4,Please I need this movie,I have seen this movie once and really enjoyed it but now I can't find it on video. I was wondering if anyone out there has this movie on tape. If they do then may I please get a copy from you. I really enjoyed this movie and now want to see it again. Thank you.
4,a wonderful love story,"I absolutely loved it. The first time I saw this movie was on showtime on cable T.V. and I could'nt wait for it to come on video for sale. This movie had it all mystery,suspense,and a couple of heart wrenching memorable scenes. With a strong male lead and a beautiful female cast the movie is pure romance full of magic. A box of tissue is a must."
3,Cool & Passionate. Magic in soft focus.,"A lovely movie. It is splendidly shot; the camera captures all the moods of the beautiful storyline. It has its greatest asset in Jenny Seagrove, whose exquisite body language complements the delicacy of the script, and has the audience rooted. Competently supported by John Shea, she exudes all feminine grace & passion. After this release, she ought to have been in contention for the sexiest roles in circulation."
4,Extremely life like and fun to look at.,"I ordered this because I was on a fake sushi kick a while back. I was buying sushi erasers, sushi pillows, sushi everything...but the real sushi. *Weird.*I love how lifelike the sushi is. My coworkers hate coming into my office now because they always seem to crave sushi after seeing my little sushi toys. lol. All a part of my evil plan to get people to eat more sushi. hehe.I highly recommend this novelty toy for any and all sushi lovers or people who just like to collect quirky items."
4,So pleasant,I really enjoyed this CD. I had a tape from years ago and wanted to have it in CD form for better storage. Very calming and well done.
4,Doesn't come with o-rings,"Have an old 82 Yamaha and need the o-rings. This filter doesn't come with the o-rings, but I used it anyway. I bought one from Napa that came with the o-rings and will buy those from now on. Otherwise from research k&n is supposed to be a good filter brand."
4,Colorful and Fun!,"The Rocking Charlie Caterpillar is a colorful, fun and unique rocker. I gave this rocker as a gift for my friend's daughter and they both loved it. It is really cute and is perfect for any young child's room."
1,My Card Disintegrated,I owned the PNY SDHC 8GB card for only a few weeks when it literally just disintegrated. The plastic cracked and it started breaking everywhere. It was well cared for and none of my other cards have ever broken. Staples would not take it back and referred me to PNY who says that this kind of issue is not covered. What a low budget piece of junk. Never again would I buy anything PNY.
3,Be Careful,"I ordered 2 of these flash drive things for my camera, and they are great and very simple to use, the problem is I only received one and I ordered and paid for two!!!"
4,PNY 16gb card,Good memory card and do not cost a lot.Works like anyone.For me theres no differen from this one or another memory card.Good item.
4,Excellent Card at a Great Price,I purchased the PNY 32 GB Class 4 SDHC Flash Memory Card to use in my Kodak Playfull ZE1 pocket camcorder.The manufacturer's manual required a Class 4 card which would allow up to 4 MB/s of data transfer rate.This PNY card has performed perfectly and the extra large capacity will allow me to record up to 5 hours of full 1080p video on my pocket camcorder.This card is a great value! Other similarly sized cards ranged from $80 (local Staples store) to an average of $40 from online retailers.
1,Doesn't work,Received the card quickly. Was to use it for transferring slides to card using a Wolverine imager. Worked for the first 150 - 200 photo transfers then suddenly received 'Card Error' message. Other cards I have work fine in the machine. Message remains and cannot read / write to card. Wasted time recording images.
2,Would've been a great card,"So, I bought two of these cards to use with my Canon T2i for HD video recording.Unfortunately, only one of these cards actually worked for HD video recording. That card worked really well. The other card, I figured, was a one-off defect since it was basically a normal SD card with the HD sticker slapped on it. It would record about 4 seconds of video then fail out because the data was coming to it too quickly. I took it back and got a replacement from Best Buy, took that one home to find that it had the exact same defect as the one I had just returned. Sure the card is still usable with the defect for taking photos, but so is a $5 card of the same size. I wanted this card for recording HD video, and for that it has proven entirely useless.Clearly, there's a reason that they're clearing these out at 1/3 of their original price, since it appears only 1/3 of them actually work as intended. Don't buy this card, get a more reliable one."
3,16GB SDHC Card,I purchased this SD card for use in my Kodak Si8 camcorder. Every time I attempted to use it in the camera it locked the camera and I would have to remove the battery to get the camera operational again. With an 8GB card there was no problem with the camera. Don't know if it is an SD card problem or camera problem as the SD cards are from different manufacturers.
2,Help,"I purchased the PNY optima SDHC class 4 16gb card for my Kodak zi8 and it doesn't seem to work. I'm not sure if there is something I am supposed to do, or its just not compatible. If someone can help me, I would appreciate it.Thanks,Jeff"
5,What more can be said?,"Well it's a 32 gig storage card. It does exactly what it is supposed to and I had no troubles using it to backup my PS3 files so I could swap out the HDD. And now that the Wii recognizes larger format cards, I think i'll be using this in that device, or my digi-cam."
5,Great company and well made product,This is a company that goes above and beyond if there is any issue with their products. They simply will replace with no questions asked.
1,JUNK!!!!!!!,This card is complete junk!! Only buy it if you want all your pictures deleted before you put them on your computer!!! It won't go on to your computer unless you format it and then it deletes everything when it formats which unfortunately I didn't know! P!SSED!!!
5,Effective way to store pictures,"I've never care about brands in regards to memory cards. I always feel like as long as you're using it correctly, ie. not removing it while it is being written, then you wouldn't have any problems with it. I gave this to my sister for her birthday and she's very satisfied with it. She primarily uses it with her camera and never had any problems with it. Price is reasonable for 16 gigs and I recommend this for anyone for any other uses they may find on it."
5,Great SDHC card!,"This card performs very well when recording SD and HD video. The recording speed, as well as transfer speed perform very well. I recommend this card for pretty much any function."
1,"Problem at 4 months, did not mistreat","My card shows signs of corruption, even though it is relatively new and it has been ""babied"". I thought it was a good, inexpensive purchase--but now I'm sorry I didn't go with a more familiar name."
3,"Works as expected, but not close to 32Gb","It's a fine SDHC card, speeds are pretty much as expected. But, only formats at 28.9Gb, a full 10% less then advertised. No card or drive formats as stated, but seriously, 90% of stated is pretty crappy. The index doesn't take 3.1Gb."
1,They Don't Work Right!!,"I bought these at Walmart in a 2pack, I saw their ad on the back of dpmag; and thought ""these must be pretty good cards then!"" Nope, they are not compatible with my camera. I walked around the zoo for about 2 hours taking really cool pictures. I hit the review button to see my photos, they were there. That night, I went to upload my pictures.... blank memory card! They say they are not compatible with my camera...I WILL NEVER purchase another PNY memory card EVER AGAIN!!!!"
2,Ehh,"I wanted an micro sd and got this thing so I am not happy about it. That being said, why is this company making this regular sd still? If somebody needs a big sd you can take a micro and put it into a converter. That is what ALL camera companies do."
4,Great packaging,I liked the fact that the packaging was 100% recyclable. It was in a cardboard box which I threw in the recycling bin. The memory worked fine in my Dell Streak 7.
5,PNY Optima 8GB SDHC Class 4 Flash Memory Card P-SDHC8G4-EF,"Perfect to store massive quantity of pictures and videos into my small camera, but it comes with a consecuence, make sure you downdload the pictures to you PC once in a while."
4,Good card,"I noticed how some people are saying they will ""never buy this brand again"" and that the brand is total crap. And yet the people that are actually unhappy with the card is less than 10, and the number of people happy with the card are about 45. Make me 46. I work at Best Buy, and we've never had people have problems with PNY memory cards and those that do, we happily exchange them out. You can't get a perfect product every time. Anything could mess up after a while.I have a Sandisk memory card in my old camera (about 2 1/2 years old), and my mom has the exact same size and brand in hers, and hers is the exact same camera as mine. The problem that she and i are coming across is that the Sandisk card is saying ""jpg incompatible"" with some of her photos and videos. My Sandisk memory card has started doing the same thing with mine. Does this mean i'll never buy a Sandisk memory card? Not necessarily. But i'm trying PNY for now in my new camera."
5,Dylan's Best GH Package-But Should Be Re-Issued On 1 CD,"This second greatest hits package does not have the obvious hits featured on the first package, which was released four years earlier. But some of Dylan's best tracks are here....""Lay Lady Lay"", ""Maggie's Farm"", ""Watching The River Flow"" and ""Its All Over Now Baby Blue"" to name a few, and not to mention the new recordings of the three Basement Tapes-era songs, especially ""You Ain't Goin' Nowhere"" and ""I Shall Be Released"". Its disappointing that the 21 tracks take up 2 CD's though. Because the total time of both discs is only 81 minutes, and one disc can hold about 79 minutes worth of songs, I would favor editing one track from the collection. This could be easily accomplished by putting 'She Belongs To Me' on GH one, where it would fit in nicely between 'It Ain't Me Babe' and 'Like A Rolling Stone', leaving the remaining 20 songs on one disc."
3,Bob D's>GRTHTSII(remastered),"Someone correct me if I'm wrong but wasn't ""George Jackson"" on the origional Greatest Hits II. I don't see it here SO what's so GREAT about this ONE >>>>>NOTHING. If you have Bob's CD's or tapes >>Get the song list and ""BURN YOUR OWN GREATEST HITS VOL. II. It would be worth alot more."
4,A great collection of hits,"This album sure isn't as good as the first volume of greatest hits, yet it has a few real hot songs on it, such as Lay Lady Lay, or Stuck Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues. As the listener below said, they were good because of other artists, doesn't that make Bob Dylan's music greater than it is? The bands such as Jimi Hendrix who re-did the songs obviously liked the music so they re-did it, that isn't an put-down to the album, it shows that people all over loved the music.Volume 1 of the hits is definently the best, but this is a great buy. Check it out. You will remember the songs forever... because Bob Dylan is forever!!"
1,Should have been on a single disc,"Only complaint I have is this should have been on 1 disc. Disc 1 is 36 minutes flat & disc 2 is 42:23. All 21 tracks could have easily fit on one space-saving 78 minute disc. Only way to justify this being on 2 discs would be to include at least 1 bonus track, which Columbia has done on some other artists' reissues. Other labels have reissued 2 LP sets on 1 CD, such as Jimi Hendrix's Electric Ladyland, The Who's Tommy & Elton John's Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, so they should have done that with this album."
3,"Whose ""hits"" are these, anyway?","Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits Volume Two??? Who's leg is being pulled here, our's or his? The guy's a great songwriter but when it comes to ""hits,"" well, he hasn't had enough of his own for even one album. ""All I Really Want to Do"" was a smash for Cher, ""The Mighty Quinn"" was a hit for Manfred Mann, ""My Back Pages"" and ""You Ain't Goin' Nowhere"" were hits for the Byrds, ""Don't Think Twice, It's All Right"" was a hit for Peter, Paul and Mary, and so on and so on. The only real hit here that was Dylan's is ""Lay, Lady, Lay."" The grade reflects the overall quality of the songs and the recordings (""Watching the River Flow,"" hardly a hit, isn't very good, and neither is ""When I Paint My Masterpiece""), but Dylan's best work is best appreciated in the context of the albums in which they initially appeared, not in some ""package"" like this."
4,I just realized how good this is!,"I have owned this CD for 8 or 9 years, and never really gave it a good listen, as I don't generally like compilations, and prefer hard to find and live stuff. But after a few listens recently, this contains some of Dylan's best and more obscure officially released stuff. Folky, country, and poetic."
3,Bought to be complete.,This album was a long time wish-list companion.I had to have it because of the not-issued-before status of some songs. In the Netherlands it was not on sale anymore also second-hand.Now I'm a happy man because of the quality of these songs both musically and verbally.
5,It's Bob Dylan All Over Again!,"I got this CD mostly because it was driving me crazy not to know the tune to I Shall Be Released, but now that I have it, I like almost every song. I love Bob Dylan (I dunno 'bout that harmonica, though :), and my favorite songs on this CD are Stuck Inside of Mobile With the Memphis Blues Again, Watching the River Flow, and I Shall Be Released. (However, in my Bob Dylan songbook, there is a 3rd verse to this last that I was rather disappointed to see missing. Oh well.) I also recommend Vol. 1 of these compilations (sorry, TCBWalsh, but I love It Ain't Me Babe!), and Joan Baez's recordings of his songs. Also, some of his very early records (the freewheelin' bob dylan, etc.) have some great but little-known songs such as Talking World War III Blues."
5,I love this album of Bob Dylan's.,I'm replacing my old vinyl albums from the early 70s with CDs so I can play them in my new car. I used to play the hell out of them on my stereo back in the day. I had forgotten how neat Bob Dylan's music is.
4,Tomorrow Is A Long Time,"The original Dylan Greatest hits Vol. 1-3 are real irrelevant with all the better best of albums that out available. However Vol. 2 is worth every penny because it is the only album to contain ""Tomorrow Is A Long Time"". In my opinion the best Dylan Song ever."
4,IT'S ALL ABOUT THE QUEEN!,"jv is on the real, down loca and has nothing to hide. this is a good cd most of her tracks are off the chain. all depends on what you like. if you like it real and want to drop some beats here it is. you can reminisce and think about back in the day you know. nayba'hood queen is my favorite, it's tight. take a listen on these samples and you'll see what i mean. she's been doing this for a while, and she still gots it. take a quick listen and if you like it then cool, and if not there's plenty more to choose from."
4,No Acid! Wahey!!,"So, what's the big deal with acid free anyway? Longer lasting pages and low toxic levels? To me, a consumer, the pens were quite average. In one, the ink exploded out of the back when I took it travelling. It still worked, but looked messy. The ink sometimes skips, maybe its a problem on the paper though. They are enjoyable to use, and great as gifts to students."
5,"A good, wide-ranging introduction","I don't own this, but I know all the tunes on here and if you are curious about this band and want to know more, many of their best tunes are on this two-disc set. Unlike a lot of compilations, this one presents a relatively-risk-free way to introduce yourself to what I think is the best prog-rock band EVER."
3,solid prog jamming,"I liked this CD when I first got it, and listen to it more than plenty of others. The track sequencing is good: unlike a lot of greatest-hits albums, this doesn't feel like a hodgepodge. I think the strongest quality of these songs is the integration of the electronic elements and the drums/bass/guitar parts.On the other hand: for whatever reason, despite good playing, interesting melodies, and so on, I've never had any interest in hearing more from the Ozrics. I guess it isn't any more than what it is."
1,"Bad, Bad, Bad",This was WAY overpriced and didn't work as well as hair gels/putty I purchased for one-third of the price. I would never buy this again.
3,not so good,it does not provide enough power to have all the features of supplied device on. It looks like only 1/3 of power needed gets through.
1,Did not work,Did not work used it for freezer and did not do a thing. Waste of time and money thought this would solve my problem
2,Gives different product,"They tend to give a slightly different product. A white one. Wasn't too satisfied because i wasn't notified that i'd get something different, But it kinda works,so im not making a huge fuss for it."
4,A good starting point,"This book has a very clear objective. It wants to get you from W95 to Linux on your PC and show you that you can get the same functionality you are used to on a PC in Linux.It succeeds in that narrow scope. I am typing this from my newly running Linux system. However, this book is not enough to really get you running smoothly.Linux is still not ready for the average user -- though the book would argue otherwise. There are enough gotchas to take you out of the narrow path of the book pretty quickly, and then you will need other resources. In my case, I need to learn how to get my sound card working and my Zip drive running, and the PPP dialer working. The paths suggested in the book didn't work.Fortunately, the author points you to other resources on the web so you can continue your search.The book comes with a copy of Red Hat 6.0. So it gives you everything you need to get started. However, I would also buy a reference type book as well."
3,Its good,"I liked the book in a way, but its start you with a server point of view, i am new to linux and am still having problem connecting my box to the internet, i guess you have to buy more than one book to really understand linux and how it works, this is my 3rd linux book i am reading right now and so far i think its good enough to get you started."
4,Good Value For the Money,Lots to do with this set and the dinosaurs are well built. It's a great alternative to the more expensive playsets and I feel it has comparable playability.
3,Luke Warm,"The Carter Family Collection is all it was advertised to be but was not all that I expected to me. I am used to working out of the key of G for the Banjo and the standard guitar tuning for the guitar. The book favors the key of C, which means that as a beginner, I will need to put the book on the shelf and go back to the drawing board of learning to develop to the interchange of keys."
2,"Good songs, not easy playing","While the songs here are a great collection, what is not clear until you purchase the book is that the Carter's enjoyed playing the C chord shape, but not in the key of C. Therefore, most of the songs require non-standard tuning of your guitar - usually tuning DOWN frets (like from E to E flat) so even a capo doesn't help. Who wants to constantly be changing the tuning of all the strings just because you'd like to play one song?"
4,The Ray Gun is Zapping You.,"I adore this album. It has to be listened to myself, alone, when I'm feeling really blue, cuz it pumps me up.Certainly, most reviewers ""in the know"" about this group probably dont consider this one of their best, and who can blame them? Progress is too fast for the faint of heart, and pop is too lame for those who cannot find words for their own feelings. For those, please listen to ""My Friend is a Stooge to the Media Priest"".For all the rest, listen to this clash of pop and alternative rock blast out your ears and hammer you to your couch.The lyrics to this album are very esoteric, and very funny at times, but Beach Boys and Montana are pleasing to the ear and make me go to that special place in my mind when I'm estatic about a song.Try something different, raise up your troubles and cares and woes, and lay them on this alter of pop."
1,not the Mustaphi I remember,"from me old vinyl, picked up on a remainder table in Der Schweiz lo these twenty years ago. They came to San Diego in '91, and I was all jazzed to go see them, but the first Gulf War started that night, and it ruined me mood.What about the Three Engineers of the Chiba Railway? The Rose, The Girl, The Wolves?"
4,Al Green plus more great soul,"Hi Records may be known as the home of Al Green's greatest recordings, but it was also the label where producer Willie Mitchell worked a lot of other musical magic. The label name, Hi, says the booklet inside this CD, is an acronym of ""Hit Instrumentals."" In the early days of the label, Willie Mitchell himself recorded a bunch of instrumentals (check out his tasty version of ""Soul Finger"" on here), as did artists like Ace Cannon and Bill Black. But most of the tracks on this compilation are vocal goodies. Many have heard this version of ""Tired of Being Alone"" by Al Green, and maybe also Al's cover of ""The Letter"", but chances are most of the other tracks are new discoveries, tunes from Hi Records stalwarts such as Don Bryant, Otis Clay, O.V. Wright, Ann Peebles, Syl Johnson, plus a few even more obscure artists. And it's all good; more Southern Soul magic."
4,WARNING: Multiple Versions,"I bought this movie, as well as the rest of the series, at the mall. Unfortuneatly there is more than one name for this movie, and I was duped by the salesman to buy two of them. I own:Shogan Assassin II: Lupine WolfLone Wolf & Cub 3: Baby Cart to HadesSince Shogan Assassin is actually Lone Wolf & Cub 1 and 2 edited together, i should have put things together in my head that Shogun Assassin II would then be Lone Wolf & Cub 3.I'm just commenting this on all of the Lone Wolf & Cub 3 Sequal Variants so no one buys and extra DVD by accident I did.I hope this was helpful. Oh and by the way, Shogan Assassin is fricken awesome (I recommend Battle Royale and Samurai Champloo [Anime, but still sweet] if you like this type of Japanese film)"
4,The Stranglers - In The Night,"A milestone in the discography of the The Stranglers. Not because it is a brilliant album (although it isn't bad) but because this is the first release without Hugh Cornwell, the lead singer/guitarist and founding member. His influence on the output of the band was so great that he had to be replaced by two people. Paul Roberts sings well on this his first outing and John Ellis' guitar play is quite professional. Founding member JJ Burnell sings on fewer tracks than previous albums to the detriment of the quality in my honest opinion. Still, it is a fair album of catchy pop tunes. With a long playing time this CD is worth its price and with a bit of time will grow on you."
3,"Starts off strong, but fads a bit","First, before I say anything else, I do like this CD. The first two tracks are excellent and were the reason I purchased this CD. The problem for me is that *some* of the other songs are bit too repeatative and a bit lacking it terms of lyrics. I've heard she has toured with Ani DiFranco and her influnce is clear. If your a fan of Ani DiFranco this might be an interesting purchase."
3,beware of description,"Watch arrived yesterday, watch is nice good quality, but I needed a light up dial received watch and its.only glow in the dark. I assumed it was indiglo/ backlight its not."
5,"low, low, low...","The music is like a chocolate cake so dark you think it is black, and a coffee stained denim pant leg that smells of smoke from a dozen bar nights. Get some of this music soon and feel the low-down lively wave that was Morphine."
5,brilliant.,"This may be the best album ever made. I'd have to race it against Miles Davis 'kind of blue' to get a definitive winner. But who cares; it's up there in the rarefied air of utterly, stunning brilliant albums. Play after play, this album improves; and it's simply one of the best albums I've ever found for testing speakers. If a pair can accurately reproduce the breathy tone of Colley's sax on Dawna, *and* the growl and rumble of Sandman's bass, they can do almost anything.This is an album everyone should own; people who don't get this record might as well give up, they don't get music."
5,A cure for what ails you,"A brilliant boatride on the seas of moody-groove. This album always reminds me of smokey jazz clubs. Morphine carries its patented bass/sax sound to the grave with the death of Sandman, but the spirit lives on. The rhythms will infect your mind if you're not careful. All I can say is Buena! Buena!"
5,Sexy Sax and Languid Lyrics,"""She had black hair like ravens crawling over her shouldersAll the way downShe had a smile that swervedShe had a smile that curvedShe had a smile that swerved all over the road""The lyrics rock as much as the music."
3,An innovative approach,"Credit should always go to those innovators who shed the conventions of rock and roll to reinvent the craft. Traffic's ""John Barleycorn Must Die"" was recorded almost completely without guitar. Blood, Sweat and Tears put brass back in the blues in ""Child is Father to the Man"". The Stray Cats stripped rock to a hollowbody electric guitar, bass, and stand-up drum kit. The Replacements sang the beer-soaked lyrics of their Minneapolis roots.In like manner, Morphine comes up with something original here. It's refreshing, innovative, and musical to its core. My personal favorites are Buena and A Head with Wings. But I really must take exception to all the reviewers who give this effort five stars. It's a CD I'm glad to have, but that rating has to be reserved for the top ten percent of my collection, which this just doesn't make. I look no further than another great Boston group, the Either/Orchestra for a higher rating."
5,Music of mood,"This is the quintessential mood disc. It works at night, or on a rainy day. It works when I'm down, or when I'm just lounging and trying not to think too hard. I bought this disc the day I ended things with a girl, as a sort of consolation prize. It did its job. Track two especially. By the time it was over I still felt pretty bad, but somehow the music put it all in a context where the emotions made sense. I was able to go out that night and have a decent time. Of course this was on my car stereo.This is innovative music, but I don't think of it in those terms. For me it is cathartic and electrifying. It would be that way even if a lot of bands had that sax-bass-drums lineup. It's the songs. They're classics and pack a punch.Not music for a bright sunny day. Save it for the rain."
4,A Versitile Performer,"Not many people appreciate or even know of Mike Garsons achievements, from the days of arranging and playing for David Bowie, ""Aladdin Sane"" has some awesome and unusual piano solos, to the subtle sounds of flute and piano, then albums such as this where he can show us his prowess as a fine jazz pianist. He really is amazingly versitile. And have you heard his two albums, ""A Man & A Women,Sax At The Movies"" being one of them, absolutely terrific and classy. You wouldn't know he was responsible for all the arrangments unless you read the credits. Seems as if he a nice humble guy too...Enjoy, he gets my full attention. Steve Shooter..."
4,This isn't Goth Music,"Okay I enjoyed the CD personally, and that you can't take the songs seriously they are done for fun/humor. That being said this isn't goth music at all or remotely close to it. Marilyn Manson isn't goth music, nor is godsmack, or any other metal band you know of.Bands like Cruxshadows, Emilie Autumn, London After Midnight, siouxsie and the banshees, Bauhaus, Ministry and Bella Morte just to name a few. The fact that you all call this goth music is funny.That being said listen to what you like don't let petty reviews control you on buying something decide for yourself. I liked the CD. you might, or might not I wouldn't personally know."
4,Bloodlust69 is an idiot,"Clearly the man that reviewed this and said that it was awful doesn't get it. They aren't trying to be scary, they are into horror films and are making intentionally cheesy, funny lyrics. The intent is to revive something in music that has been gone since the New York Dolls and the Plasmatics. Its an attempt at having music for the sole purpose of fun. And to top it off, you end with a Murderdolls update about Tripp Eisen, well to bad he's not in the band, he recorded the album with them but that was it, when touring time came he had to call it quits and stay loyal to Static-X."
5,pure freshness,"play it till it pops. modern technology with a twist of adventure. take it on the buss, rock it in the headphones. A long full length by rocker that enhances your imagination. i recommend this to any body who is a first time Dino Felipe fan and buyer. you'll love it, better than some of the other stuff he's put out. Also on schematic, which is no longer around."
3,Maybe a good resource.,"The title defines the scope of this book. It is a list of home products (cabinets, appliances, hardware, etc.) which support universal design. It also contains a number of plans which demonstrate UD (Universal Design).The list of products shows which UD aspects each product features. The list of products is pretty good, but had several lapses that I noticed right away.The plans tend to be on the high end. The plans are good but not extremely creative. They are not very diverse in style either.Since the book is not expensive it is probably worth the investment for the useful information in it. Don't look for many idea photos--they aren't here. Although the author has featured numerous, nice photos of one very high end showpiece UD house, it is not the kind of house most of us will ever come close to building.If you have made the decision to go the UD direction, this book could help with the details."
3,OMG!,"OMG! i can't believe i actually read these as a teen nothing the way nurisng is now, but then again what is ! I have to laugh the way things were back then. thank goodness! i just hope that none of my great neices picks up these books until someone revise them!"
1,Not a ghost of a chance,This is a book that is not for ghost story fans but for fans of pointless modern fiction. What a disappointment! Suspense? None. Spooky goings-on? None. Merely unlikeable characters muddling through plotless fiction. Bad choice
1,A bad choice,I ordered this headset hoping that it will work with my phone. Unfortunately it was incompatible with my phone. It requires an amplifier which costs over 60 dollars. I had to return it for full refund.
2,Not For Me,Tried to replace a Plantronics firefly headset. Not only did I not see that you needed adapter to plug it into a 3.5mm plug vs Jabra's special plug. although that didn't bother that much however it seems that these headset are not compatible with the plantronics CT12 although it works there is a pulse sound that is very evident and annoying. over all not a bad headset but incompatible for my application
3,Jabra headst,I don't like the return policy but the headset came very quick will need to see product more closer before buying and will look at policy more closer I can't really rate this item never got to use it but the company said they will return my money in full
1,Pedestrian; very disappointing,"I'm coming off a Trisha Malcolm high with her brilliant Vogue Crochet Scarf book. Because of that, I was felt doubly let down when I reviewed this book. I find the patterns very dull and worse, the large % of big ""motif"" or seasonal patterns amateurish. I read the entire book at a bookstore and found only one crochet block (a hexagon) worth note... and I was able to memorize that. I can't emphasize enough that this is a book you should see before buying. I'm sure glad I did."
5,Fantastic crochet patterns,I love this crochet book. I have made one blanket so far out of it. I got tons of compliments on it. I've made over 50 blankets and the blanket that I made from this book got the most feedback and compliments. It was a much loved blanket!
5,A great book!,I received this book quickly and was so excited to see the projects in it! They are easy to understand and could easily be adapted to your specific needs. It's a great book!
1,outdated and not innovative,"I have never been more disappointed with the selection, instruction and overall delivery of a book. If crochet is your thing, perhaps you will like it because the greater percentage of patterns are definitely crochet. If you are long time knitter and are seeking unique, styled, innovative patterns to bring to life - this is not the book. Perhaps if you are just beginning this may impress you. What I will say no matter what your skill level, the pictures are hard to understand because within one pattern there are several patterns which you can't see in the image and have to think, versus the book giving you this.This book was clearly published with a concept in mind, but not enough consulting took place with the yarn manu or they simply provided them with old patterns. Save your money - I've seen these patterns at JoAnn Fabric and Michaels on the displays for free.So disappointed and I never write reviews."
4,Incredible Stuff,"I had initially bought this album for Terence Blanchard's rendition of 'Saeta'. But the rest of the album is mind blowing in itslef, dark, moody. has almost a rugged ambient feel to it.This is my first album, of thomas newman, surely not going to be the last. Its a great record, buy it after u see the movie."
1,Did not fit in my 12 x 12 scrapbook,"Maybe it's because of the brand of album I was using, but these Pioneer inserts did not fit. Once I inserted them into the album (following the company's own instructions), a 12 x 12 sheet of paper would not fit in the sleeve without being bent. They do not have the extra half-inch between the sleeve and the holes, and this is necessary (otherwise part of the sleeve is covered by the binding of the album, and everything in the album gets bent when you flip through it). Although the packaging said it could be used with a post-style album, it's clear these are made only for 3-ring binders and nothing else.It's a difficult issue to explain, so I hope this makes sense. I was told at Michael's that they would fit ""any 12 x 12 album,"" and this is simply not true. I also found the plastic to be very flimsy."
4,good stuff,"very nice and just what I wanted. It is good to have both the vinyl cover and the insert page. For those desiring a economical scrapbook, this is what you are looking for."
3,Pioneer Postbound page protectors,"I thought page protectors were all the same, but these actually are a little bit short and my finished standard pages stick out the top by about an eighth of an inch. Therefore, it's hard to trim that little bit and still keep the completely decorated edges. Also, I'm afraid the photos will slip out ."
4,Great,"Great delivery, and easy to load into your scrapbook. I bought it at a great price, but since then I think the price has gone up 2 dollars."
5,Scrapbook Refill Pages,Item was shipped on time and arrived quickly. I was very satisfied and will order more fillers when needed.
3,fits my scrapbook but not enough,"The delivery took longer than other items bought on Amazon and when it did come, I was a little disappointed. The quality of the refill pages were sufficient but there were only 5 pages! No where on Amazon did it say only 5 pages were in the pack. I definitely needed more than 5 pages since it was for my wedding scrapbook! I have to say the pages did fit my Pioneer scrapbook perfectly."
5,Just what I needed,"These are good quality and very easy to use. They look like they would fit in other brand books too, but I did use them in a Pioneer brand book. They are thicker than the ones that I usually buy and I like the look of them a lot better."
4,Good album,It is my first scrapbooking album. It is beautiful. The only inconvenient is that I have to cut a little border of 12x12 scrapbooking paper because it doesn't fit in the page.
3,cheaper,i think it would have been less if id bought them at the 99cents store. Shipping was more expensive! Product was worth it though.
5,Early Sliver Bullet Gold!,"These movies are horribly good! Wrath of the Skunk Ape is a z grade movie with A+ chicks, comedy, and story! Stew is just as bad but loaded with over the top gore. This dvd is full of bonus features and short films . definitely worth it to have this movie on your dvd shelf."
3,It Has It's Moments,"""House of Flowers"" was based upon a short story by the same name by Truman Capote, who also wrote the book and lyrics for the musical. Harold Arlen wrote the music. The show did not do well but played long enough to get a cast album recorded. The score is a mixed bag that is, for the most part, mediocre. On the strong side you have Dianne Carol's rendition of ""A Sleeping Bee"" and Pearl Bailey's ""One Man Aint Quite Enough"" with its wonderful ad-libbed line at the end about how the song wasn't finished. On the just, plain bad side you have ""Slide Boys Slide"". A horrible song that Juanita Hall gives her best to, given the material. The other performances are well done by the other cast members. The CD engineering is well done with a good balance between singers and orchestra. The documentation is complete and interesting. It just cannot overcome its flaws."
3,Not worth waiting for-mediocre score with great cast wasted,"What a cast line-up: Pearl Bailey, Diahann Carroll, Juanita Hall, Geoffrey Holder, Ray Walston, Alvin Ailey. And what a dud!There are three good songs (A SLEEPIN BEE, DON'T LIKE GOODBYES and TWO LADIES IN DE SHADE OF DE BANANA TREE) among thirteen. The cast tries but there is no magic in the libretto or the lyrics and the calypso style music keeps sounding like itself.One did not expect an expert novelist like Capote to write a great lyric but one did expect Arlen to contribute a great score. This is no ST. LOUIS WOMAN - a far better score by Arlen. I don't even recommend this for fans of the stars-with the one exception of Diahann Carroll, who sounds lovely and innnocent, despite her having a cold when the recording was made. (In fact, she's so innocent, she's sounds positively simple-minded!)"
5,Sweet and Sophisticated,"This recording couldn't be bettered, but the new release includes as a bonus a smattering of interesting related material - an alternate version of ""Two Ladies in the Shade,"" Capote reading part of the original short story, Arlen performing an early version of ""A Sleepin' Bee,"" et al. There are new liner notes, more photos, and an expanded version of ""Mardi Gras.""Though it's wonderful to have this gem available again, it is puzzling and annoying to note several flaws. The tracks of the original recording are out of order (""Mardi Gras"" is back where it should be, but Royal's ""Turtle Song"" now follows what should have been the final number). The booklet is not without typos or factual errors (the writer places Pearl Bailey's famous ad-lib in the wrong song). Considering they had years to put this together - couldn't they have double-checked it before printing?That said, if you love Broadway or American music, this is a must for your collection. Nothing could dim this score."
2,"""Remember God makes the final decision"".","The 10-15 pages that are given to the topic are informative and helpful. I agree with another reviewer and would suggest going to a library instead of spending money. Interesting concept, but in the end does it really matter?"
1,Want something that works?,"Why waste your money and time reading this book? In my culture, males are considered better than females, even though I somewhat believe in equality. After 2 daughters, I've spent 7 years looking for a way to have a boy! And I finally found a book that actually worked. But this book had been banned since the early 80's! I lucked out and bought it for a hefty price from a family friend (who didn't want to give it up at any cost). But it was worth it. It's old, ripped up, but useful so I've typed it all. EMail me at frisky1999@mailcity.com to get a photocopy of the original, or a even typed copy of it now!"
4,Steinbeck Fan,"Humorous. A collection of short chapters with interesting, colorful characters. Must be included if you like any of Steinbeck's writings. I enjoyed it."
2,These pens skip,"I don't know who wrote the two positive reviews. I hate these pens. They skip when you write, it's driving me insane. I bought them to write in the margins of a photo album, and the writing looks like crap because half of every letter is missing. Don't buy these pens."
5,Awesome Pens,"These pens are so awesome! Sick of old, hard pens that don't work? Sick of having to search your whole house for a decent pen? Get these pens NOW! They always work, and once they run out you feel the urge to buy more! Their soft grip gets rid of those old lumps and bumps from your old pens! Get these pens and you won't regret it! Not to mention that they're at a GREAT price..."
1,Undrinkable,"I have heard some hype about Harney and Son, so thought I would give them a try - I have tried several Irish Breakfast teas from other tea merchants. This tea was worst Irish Breakfast tea I have ever tried. There was no malty tones that is the signature of Irish Breakfast, and it went bitter in the pot after only a few minutes. Of the teas purchased here, Twinings represents the Irish Breakfast much better."
4,Liverpool Sessions: This cd really rocks!,"Tracy really focused on the hard side of herself on this album. Much more grungy and uncensored than ""The Burdens of Being Upright"" and ""Down Here"". Definately her shortest album, having only seven songs on the cd. She has everything from quiet and thoughtful (Sunshine) to loud and lovingly obnoxious (18 heads roll by). She is bluntly honest about her anxst and this album proves that Tracy really is a genius!"
4,A new side of Tracy Bonham!,For those who dont know of Tracy Bonham's work ... you are really missing out. She has a gifted voice and the ability to make harmony that will make your head spin. This is a CD a true Tracy Bonham fan must have. You get to see a new side to her music. Its Courtney Love meets Liz Phair but with Tracy's style. And with this great low price you would be stupid to pass it by. Also check out her other two albums that put any other CD to shame.
5,It's the real deal!,"As a former Force Recon Marine, I am proud that somebody has finally told the story the way it was. I served with many of the people in this book and I have to say that it has certainly been a long time since I had the honor to have worked with such fine people. There hasn't been a day since I left the Company that I have not thought about many of our missions, both good and bad. We were young and all charged up, but it cannot be denied that we were working at our highest potential and we fought to win, when our politicians really didn't know anything about the missions we were undertaking and still don't. RECON is another way to spell TEAM, something many people should learn more about. RECON ALL THE WAY!!!!!!!! Nice job Lt. PETERS. Give me a shout when you have the time. Formerly Sgt. Jim McKee, 1st Force Recon Company, 68-69. MUSK OX 6, OUT!"
2,Hard to swallow,"Having served with 1St Force Recon 1967-1968 I'm compelled to take most of this book with a grain-of-salt. I found that much of it reflected on either political or personal relationships of the author. Furthermore, it was difficult for me to imagine most of the extremely close combat. Eighteen inches; give me a break! 300 foot tall trees in the canopy? I never saw them. From my perspective, this work was embellished quite a bit."
3,A Good Little Book,"This tiny book has a great deal of good information regarding herbal use for digestive ailments. The majority of recommendations are broad, although some specific recipes for tinctures or teas exist, and the sections on colitis and Crohn's have very gentle herbal recommendations that would definitely not hurt anyone and may provide some useful insight for others regarding a nutritional approach to these diseases. I did try some of the suggestions, but unfortunately for me, being on Prednisone masked any effects these treatments might have produced. I've often thought that alternative treatments like those suggested in this book would be very helpful for maintaining a healthy remission or treating minor flare-ups of disease."
1,Cd Would Have Been Great&#65533;,"Make sure that you check your compilation right when you leave the store. When I purchased this CD after seeing Dio this summer on tour, I opened the CD and there were two of the second discs. Not 1 and 2. Just be careful. Other than that it sounds like a great CD. I like the one I have, but got neglected on some of the earlier Ronnie stuff."
2,Eva's Boring Cousin,"I guess this is is proof that one can experience history without having an original though in one's head. Perhaps its the historical fiction aspect of this novel, but ""Eva's Cousin"" is so much an observer in her own life, I began not to care very much what happened to her and those around her. Perhaps if she had been closer to the center of power, the dispassionate nature would have worked in a fly on the wall sort of way, but given that she never met Hitler and was on the periphery, late in WWII, of the Nazi circle. I understand the account is fictionalized, though its hard to see what aspects of it were so exciting as to have to have been invented."
2,"If this book is a novel, why pretend everything is true?","Unfortunately, this novel drags along in the opening chapters. The reader becomes as bored as Marlene, Eva Braun's cousin, who visits Eva in Hitler's mountain retreat. Though the title offers promise as a glimpse of Hitler through the eyes of his lover, the story focuses on the day-to-day life of his mistress and nothing more. While other Germans suffer miserably, it is hard to identify with the spoiled Eva and her small circle of companions.However, the story finally becomes interesting when Marlene supposedly hides a young boy who has escaped from a work camp. She becomes involved with a German officer who complicates her life. Marlene begins to learn the truth about the war by listening to an illegal radio that is eventually seized. These are the only interesting events in the entire novel.As a reader I resented not knowing what was true and what the author fabricated. I would have preferred the truth."
2,Ho Hum,"This book is a novel written by a cousin of Eva Braun, who never met Eva until 1944. She spent a few weeks at her side, but admits in interviews that she never met Adolf Hitler, nor did she ever speak to him. Even more insulting to the reader is that Eva never spoke about Hitler to her cousin. The reader is then forced to ask, ""What is the point of this book?""The answer is... nothing. Being a blood relative of Eva Braun doesn't entitle one to write a book which contains nothing whatsoever of interest, either historically or emotionally. The content is desultory and devoid any new nuggets on Hitler. Though it's written with reasonable skill, the end result is boredom for the reader. Had the author not been related to Eva Braun it would never have found a publisher, and that would have been the most pleasant outcome of all."
4,Technical Analysis Simplified worth every penny,"I found Technical Analysis Simplified to be an apt description of what Droke explains in this book-an extremely simple, easy to read way to forecast from stock market charts. This book is great in that it can be read in one or two sittings and is a helpful reference manual for looking up chart patterns that occur over and over in the market. Droke does in a little over 100 pages what Edward & Magee took over 500 pages to do. The reader who trashed this book apparently doesn't know how to read, because the introduction to Droke's book is less than six pages long. Murphy's book is also good, but is too long and much more complex. (BTW, this book is NOT out of print, as the reviewer below claimed because I got it in a couple of days from Amazon)."
1,Better Title Would Be: Technical Analysis Unsimplified,"There is a reason this book is out of print. Just getting through the first chapter was painful. The book reads like a high school term paper. I couldn't bring myself to read anymore. I ended up taking it back and getting a refund. The most useful part of this book was the suggested reading in the back, which I used to purchase ""Technical Analysis of Financial Markets"" by John J. Murphy instead. All I can say is this one is a keeper. It's easy to read and eventhough it was twice as much, it is well worth it."
3,"Wow, is this guy outside my window, waiting?","Cd starts off like the cry is in the distant, then ""Bam"" it's right next to you. It was relaxing at first, then too loud and sounded like all his buddies got in the action of the recording. Not the recorders fault, it is just as the title says, timberwolf. Just thought you would want to know."
5,Infrared signal aggregation and remote control of any IR controlled equipment.,"How sweet it is. Rack mount all your set top boxes in one place, the cable input. Run your HDTV signal to each monitor via HDMI or Ethernet and remotely control the set top box from the monitor location. Makes it a piece of cake to switch from Dish, to cable to fiber."
1,Poor arrangements.,"Only 1 Star for the album. 5 Stars for Peter Hammill. `In A Foregn Town' isn't a representative album.The real problem here are the arrangements.Very poor and repetitive in `new wave' style. Listen others versions of `Hemlock',`Time To Burn' ( Room Temperature Live ),and `Sci-Finance ( Revisited ) from `There goes to the Daylight'live in London 1993.Sounds Very Better !!! If you don`t Know Peter Hammill`s work,don`t start with this. It`s a disappoint album,but have a little `pearl' here called `The Play`s the thing',piece for piano and voice,the best song of the album. `In A Foregn Town' is only for Hammill's collectors. Don`t miss these Hammill`s Masterpieces- `Over',`Chameleon in the Shadow Of The night',`The Silent Corner & The Empty Stage',and `In Camera'. All albuns are of the 70`. In 1997 Hammill released `Every One You Hold',remind me the 70's stuff."
1,A very weak uninspired album vy hammill,A very weak uninspired album by hammill. One of the 2 or 3 bad albums by Hammill. Try other of his musical gems.
5,Super Motherboard,I don't have any word...This thing is super great...Super Easy for the O.V fans as me...
2,Zero Support,"This is my third Asus mother board. All were great, manual was excellent and email support was swift. Now all of these reasons to buy asus are missing. Manual provides no assistance, zero. FAQ online, nothing. email for assistance, no reply. Asus user Forum, no help. Got all accomplished without assistance. Went to register .... and couldn't get that done, so I gave up on it. I've wasted 38 hours on account of missing basic information & support. My previous motherboards (ASUS) were well documented with excellent definitions of BIOS options, etc. Everything went smoothly. I expected the same excellent support from ASUS today, I didn't get it. No more Asus. Be ware."
2,Nothing is THIS perfect,"I found this book so far from believable that I actually found myself shouting the words ""Oh, come on!"" at least ten times.It didn't start out all that bad - you more or less expected the life-is-so-perfect stuff as a build up to the tragedy. And, I guess it was a bit over-done, but Malory's grief was acceptable. But, after that - there was no point left to the story. There was not one single obstacle put in this woman's way - everything she tried to do turned into a roaring success! She hints at money problems immediately after the husbands death - yet there is no indication ever that money is a concern. Matter of fact, she just buys whatever she wants, keeps a staff of housekeepers on the payroll while she trots off to England for six months. Who was footing the bills?Anyone who struggled after the death of a spouse, or anyone who ever struggled to build a business best NOT pick up this book. You'll end up throw it across the room."
1,Not worth reading,"Having read the majority of Bradford's books, this was very disappointing. Some parts of the storyline just didn't work like the founding partner's son-in-law's poor performance was never explained. I actually felt that because of his bad business practices would have led to the murders of Andrew and the children and not by the thugs in Harlem. It was all too much or not enough. The ending was the worst. Some man down the street and around corner befriends Mal and her Sarah. They dine, drink coffee, he travels, purposes, Mal considers her answer and they shack up. End of story!? Honestly, this was a waste of time."
1,Oh My God....!!!,"I thought this book was so badly written thata)I couldn't read anymore than the first halfb)I kept laughing outloudWhat a load of tosh. I have only ever read one other Barbara Taylor Bradford and the was about 20 years ago, the well known 'Woman Of Substance' and I remember absolutely loving it. I can't say I even liked this one.The characters are so one dimensional and frankly BORING. The description and the dialogue are saccharine sweet. The way Mal talks about her husband and her marriage and her life in general is so idealistic it made me want to puke.Anyone who thinks this is a good read must have a brain the size of a gnat and haved the mental age of 12.I've written more interesting shopping lists."
2,Very simplistic Information you probably already know,I bought this book since it was the most up-to-date book discussing financial careers. I have found it to be too simplistic to be useful in my search for a banking job. Odds are that you too are looking for a book that gives helpful info on job hunting - so if this is your purpose I advise against the purchase of this book. Spend the extra few bucks and get the HBS Careers in Finance book instead.
2,Not what u looking for.,"I was looking for specific information and detailed description of each job in the financial industry, instead this book goes into the history of each financial sector, which is obviously not what u looking for, each job description is mixed up with statistics and history in an extremely badly organized and confused fashion."
5,The Secret Radio,"""My Way"" was put together by sampling radio waves, slicing these sounds into small parts (voices, flashes of static, a bowed string, a vocal line, computer blips and the like) and reassembling them into house-inflected techno. It sounds like the radio waves have a secret life of their own when they aren't doing their jobs broadcasting Top 40 drivel--and boy do they like to cut loose.Akufen never lets his experimentalism get in the way of a good time. All of these tracks groove in the funkiest of ways. Highly recommended."
5,Like Your Own Psychologist!,"While I believe there is a time and place to see a shrink, there is also a time and place to get real with yourself and look deep within yourself to find the root of your problems.In Finding Peace for Your Heart, Stormie shows us how vital a role God plays in our healing, and how important it is for us to be willing to look at the root of our problems. It's truly the first step towards healing and spiritual growth.I read this book with great intensity, found areas in my life that the Lord wanted me to work on, and finished it feeling truly inspired to lean on God more."
5,This book should be given out with every bible!,"I have been a christian since I was little. I grew up in a christian home with wonderful parents who set very good examples of christian living. I am currently separated from my husband, who has chose to live without God and me. I turned to this book because I was struggle so much. I love this book because it fills in the WHYs that I have asked in every prayer. I have learned so much from this book about fulfilling a peaceful heart. I have learned things that I never knew I was suppose to be doing as a christian. If you feel you are lacking or missing something, you probably are. Read this book and follow the guidance Stormie talks about. Believe it, your life will change dramatically. I have the peace that I needed to make it through this time of my life. Thank you Stormie!"
5,Back to proper music with soul and class,"Sometimes it's good to go back, back to a time when there was soul and depth to dance/club music. Retouched with perfection and mixed with love. If you like uplifting dance music with feeling, then this is for you. A history of one of the most influential labels that has affected the shape of current club and dance hits. If you want one album to lift your spirits then this is for you. Enjoy the Dance!"
3,Mastermix???,"I feel this 2 disc mix could've easily been cmpressed into 1 disc if they really wanted to strut their DJ stuff. The hype surrounding this one got to me too. West End!!! Masters At Work!!! Yo kidd, you gotta cop this one, classic, classic!!! And the intro? Why Cevin Fisher? Wouldn't it be cool for Mel himself to do a lil' narration on this joint!? OR how about no intro, and straight up mixing? Mastermix??? Was it even done on turntables?"
4,pretty darn good,The first CD on this set is on the money. But the second one is not really to my personal taste but it was still well worth the money.
1,..not even a master work..,..it seams like the hype days..of the MAW ..have gone.Bad copy of things that ''have been delivered already some years ago....by the master's...so..dear..westend..maybe ..dj spinna..or ..some fresh kid from the block gets..the chance..to make it..the next time a master work.....save your money ..for thé next issue.
3,Just okay -- not especially great and somewhat overpriced,"For $20, I expected more than what I received with this photo album. For the most part, this is an ordinary album with a few stickers to personalize it. The photo pages are decent. But, on a few, the separators between photos had come loose and it did not hold the photographs in place very well.Overall, I think you'd do better buying photo albums at Kohls, Target, etc. As it stands, this one is not worth the price."
3,"Cute but only for 4""x6""",I thought this was the Pearhead album that fits any size photo - but it is not.
5,Good quality photo album,I am very impressed with the quality of the album and the customer service. I will definitely order more.
4,Photo album,"I think this is a great photo album. I needed a larger oneand it really does the job, it holdsa lot of photo's. It seems to be of good quality.I would buy this album again."
2,Love the look but the inside falls apart,"I ordered the ivory, blue and pink albums for each of my children and I love the way they look. It took me a few weeks to get my photos printed to put in, and by that time the window to return these for a full refund had passed otherwise I would have. The plastic that holds the pictures falls off after a few uses causing the pictures to fall out. I'm going to have to try and discreetly glue the plastic back on and probably tape each picture in the album so they don't fall out. I'm disappointed because the look is exactly what I want....just bad quality. I would not buy this product again but try and find the same colors in a better quality product."
1,Very disappointed,Pearhead Side Photo Album PinkI was so excited to start putting pictures of my Granddaughter in this album - I decided I would start it off with her 1st birthday - when I went to put the 1st pic in - the binding split the whole length of the photo album - what a huge disappointment -
5,A Awesome CD,this is a awesome cd it is fun and enjoyable to listen to. the best songs on this cd are all of them. if you have not listened to this cd then i recommend that you do
4,Problem solved,"After checking with every hobby store in town, I was frustrated that no one carried the size protectors I needed for my photo albums."
4,Easy installation and a big improvement over the last adapter,Bought this to extend the range my notebook has for receiving 802.11g wireless signals. I pick up signals from all over now. Big improvement over the adapter the notebook came with. I have both XP and Vista running it with zero issues.
4,Work's well. Good throughtput. No USB stick to break off.,"I got this card to increase the connection speed of my son's HP Pavilion zv6130us laptop. The unit's built in WLAN just didn't seem to work that well.This card works great. Although, it could have something to do with us having a D-Link G router as well.At any rate, my son is playing MMORPGs at a pretty good clip. No complaints. I like the fact that the card doesn't stick way out from the laptop like a USB adapter would. This lessens the likelihood of it getting snapped off, especially when rowdy kids are involved.As far as range goes, I really can't say. We just use it in the next room.This card saved me from buying a new laptop. Can't complain."
1,Discontinued by manufacturer,No support from manufacturer. This product was discontinued in 2009. See D-link's website for info before purchasing this network card. The DWA-652 from D-link is similar to this card and is currently supported.
1,DWA-642 is horrible,"I purchased the D-Link DIR-615 router and ""matching"" DWA-642 adapter thinking I would get better range and signal compared to my Linksys wireless G router and boy was I wrong. First, the 642 adapter has a driver that constanly causes GPF errors when the adapter is not in my laptop, you know, the one where it wants to collect information and send to Microsoft. I got on with tech support and they had me download the latest driver which fixed the GPF error but did little to improve the ability to connect to the router establishing a ""link"". The 642 has been EOL'd as of last fall and replaced by a 652 which I am hoping to get from D-Link's support once my purchase is beyond 30 days old where they will warranty it. So far, this adapter/router combination has proven to have less range than my Linksys G. Unless the 652 can resolve this problem, this purchase was a complete waste of time. My laptop is Windows XP SP 3."
3,D-Link DWA-642 RangeBooster N Notebook Adapter,"With this adapter, I also purchased a D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Wireless Router. I was still unable to get decent reception in my back room. Then I got a new Thinkpad, using an 802.11G internal adapter, and suddenly I was able to connect without being dropped and at a great speed. So I am not currently using this notebook adapter."
2,Not alot of information,"This book has not enough information, and actually some of it is even false, if you know anything at all about the care and keeping of uros. I am a uro owner and belong to a uro club, and found that there is alot of important information that is not included in this book. It is mostly pictures, and doesn't even have info on some of the most common species of this lizard. I wouldn't bother buying this, you'd get better info out on the net from actual uro owners than you would from this book."
1,Don't Buy!,"No size was listed when I bought it and of course they turned out to be larger than I wanted. They fail, in my book, because and their inability to stick to anything other than paper. Waste of money!"
2,page protectors damaged,"I ordered two of these albums. They were inexpensive, so I didn't expect luxury. They look okay, but the page protectors were very flimsy and the holes for one set were torn through. Luckily, I had ordered page protectors from another source and was able to make them work for the album that I needed to get finished right away. The posts for the holes were also very short and the only way to get longer posts was to order refills, but I wasn't willing to do that when the protectors were so flimsy and damaged."
5,Books,The book was received in great condition and as scheduled.Thanks. I have always received great service from Amazon.I buy all my books here.
2,Only for non trained Brazilians,"Before I begin on the bad points I would to say this is an enjoyablevideo with a latin flavour & good soundtrack but & it is a BIGBUT. .... 95% of this video is USA Aerobics with a latin flavour with5% of only the basic step of the Samba or Capoeira. Afro danceswhether Afro-Cuban or Afro-Brazilian are specialist dances whichinvolve different body movements than of the ordinary dances. AnyBrazilian Sambistas, Male Passista or Mestre Sala dancers will findthis video a disappointment. This video is good for the USA market asthey do not know any better but do not think you will be able to jointhe real true Brazilian trained dancers. For all the bad points ofthis video it is still one of the best with a latin flavour justbeware it is very limited in what it shows you."
1,Save your money!,"I was very upset with this video...It's such a waste of money. The girl is too worried about her hair. If you like Capoeira, it has only the Ginga, and that's all. I normally love anything afro-brazilian however, this was not a good buy. A better one is ""The Method's"" Afro-Brazilian workout. If you do go with this one, all I can say is good luck!"
1,Very disapointed - returned the same day,"I purchased this saw at my local TrueValue hardware store(the saw is branded ""Green Thumb"" by TrueValue) to do some light cleanup around my camp. The blade was so poor that it would bind in maple branches no more than two inches in diameter. The teeth have almost no pitch, resulting in a kerf too narrow to allow the blade to move.I have ordered a Bahco saw available here on Amazon. (Bahco is the company that took over as manufacturer of the legendary Sandvik bow saws and the only company I know that is not importing inferior quality products from the PROC.)"
2,"Requires a lot of ""customizing""","This required quite a bit of effort to finally get it to fit into my ""01 Honda Odyssey. It is made for several different cars and I had to break off a lot of pieces to make it fit. Should have been easier or could have mentioned that it is not specific to my car's make and model."
1,There is better,"The text and the tapes do not go well together. Worse, there is no progression in the teaching of the language. It is all disconnected chunks and there may be some mistakes. It is not good for communication either; too unpractical in approach. I felt I wasted my money and have bought another one since. I would recommend Punjabi Made Easy by Nagra instead."
2,"Good cartoons, monolithic text","This course looks pleasant, with nice pictures, but is not nice to use at all. I could point out several faults, but the worst is that dialogues and language information are disjointed. You go through a dialogue, then you read the grammar trying to learn how the language works, but you get little or nothing. The language information comes in rigid blocks that have little or nothing to do with the more practical sections of the book. A logical link is missing between the two. It is very difficult to learn the language with this course."
1,Rather frustrating,"Basically I find this course very difficult to follow. You don't get the assistance you need. Some things do not match, I don't know whether they are right or wrong. Some sections look like they may have been written by someone who is still trying to learn the language."
3,Nice looking,I was stupid and didn't read the fine print and found out it requires a $60 piece before it will work. My fault. I am sure it's a very nice headset.
1,The full book has been published.,"Although this bootleg/samizdat edition served a purpose, the full book has been published in 1994.Get it hereThe Truth, the Way, the Life: An Elementary Treatise on Theology: The Masterwork of B.H. Robertsor hereTHE TRUTH, THE WAY, THE LIFE: AN ELEMENTARY TREATISE ON THEOLOGY (1927-28) 2ND EDITION."
4,Pink cables are unique,Gives one the ability to identify your instrument cords over the other members in the band who all have black. People comment on them.
1,DONT BUY THIS ON AMAZON,La Mer Lip Balm costs $45 at retail stores. dont pay these fools the money they are asking. this is an AMAZING product at a horrible price. you could buy 2 or 3 for the price these thieves are asking.
2,Not Inspirational,"Ever since I first heard Sonny Sharrock play on Albert Ayler's ""The Last Album"" I have wanted to hear more of this mad man genius guitarist. Although I only have a few of his albums so far, this one again comes up short for me. Sonny seems to have many sides though and I give him credit for his attempts at a variety of ideas and sounds. I am not at all familiar with Skopelitis but I have to say I can't often tell which is which on this unaccompanied duet effort. Some tunes, like the first one, really strike me as pretty mundane efforts. Other tunes have a fairly nice feel to them but it is mostly very simple ramblings relying heavily on the electronics for that Bill Connors / Return to Forever effect. It just doesn't generally come off as powerfully as Bill & Chick pulled off and it lacks all the other instrumentation that made RTF pretty inspiring for it's day. This is OK but it doesn't seem worthy of what Sonny is capable of from what I have heard of his earlier work."
3,"Good book, but watch out for errors","This book generally lives up to its reputation. It has good coverage of FrontPage from the basics to fairly advanced techniques involving databases, client-side scripting, and ASP scripting. I found most of the answers I have been looking for to build better webs with FrontPage.I would have rated this book higher if I had been more impressed with its Web support sites. For example, Tutorial 20-2 has an error in the onSubmit event handler. That's okay, so long as I can download a correction from the Web. But the data file on the authors' and publisher's support sites not only fails to correct the error, but the code in the file doesn't match the tutorial in the book. That's a weak feature of an otherwise good book."
3,My Secret Passion,Michael Bolton has obviously worked hard to perfect his performance for these classics. His delivery of the arias on this video is superb. His vocal range is suited to this genre of music even though his name is not the first that comes to mind when thinking of opera. By adding an explanation as to what the aria is actually about you are free to feel the full range of emotion this type of exquisite music can bring. A very good initial offering.
3,Fast Paced but chessy,"Codex is a fast paced thriller about the 3 sons of Maxwell Broadbent. When Max -- who's a ""tomb raider"" so as to speak dies, he buries himself and his fortune (paintings, artifacts worth billions) in a tomb in Honduras and challenges his sons to find their inheritance.Though the story is fast paced and the characters are well built (For instance, all 3 characters are totally different and the ""character arc"" is smooth), the plot is marred by improbabilities and some cheesy dialogues. Also, the story is quite predictable and the adventurers never face much danger from the jungle or nature.An ok book that could have been a lot better...(still good enough to spend a lazy sunday afternoon)"
2,"A simplistic, disappointing tale","I was really excited to read this book, but about halfway through I just wanted it to end. This book was far too simplistic and broad for its subject matter. The three boys are real cardboard, two-dimensional characters. The trek through the jungle, I thought, just skimmed the surface of the atmosphere it was capable of. In fact, the whole riddle of the codex is nearly forgotten! I'm a big fan of Preston's and Child's writing, their collaberation is terrific. But this one is poor at best."
2,Not so much,This book is only good for light entertainment. I had it on CD because I don't think I could have physically read the book. The only way I could get through it was listening to it while doing other things.
5,Highly Entertaining,"I had no problem with this story and it was one of those books I could not put down. The characters were well drawn, the premise good, and the descriptions of the environment made me glad to live in the desert!So what if the ending was predictable? If it had ended any other way, I would have been upset.Some may call this type of story old school, but I just wish there were more like it out there. Highly recommended."
1,Worst chapter and a paragraph I ever read!!!,"This book was so painfull it made a trip to the dentist sound enjoyable. The idea that a cop could actually afford 10 cups of Starbucks a day is so ridiculous (that's about $40 a day, also known as a coke habit)it sent me on a twenty minute rant on the idiotness of the author. Not to mention the line, ""Even the criminals took the day off"". Do yourself a favor, save your money for a Double Mocha Grande and don't buy this book."
4,A hunt for hundred of millions of dollars worth of treasure,"First off I have to say that this book does not go into a lot of depth but does give you an exciting adventure story. After a treasure hunter leaves, he tells his sons who he has always been dissapointed in that he has buried himself with all of his treasure and they have to find him. This leads to the 3 brothers joining up and fighting anacondas and all kinds of cool stuff. It is a book that will keep you in it all of the way and is a pretty quick read."
1,Bungle in the jungle is right,"Having read all of Preston-Child's collaborative efforts (and considering myself a fan), I was/am shocked and saddened at how bad this book is. I've read 'Deep Storm' by Lincoln Child and enjoyed it. I've also read 'Monster of Florence' by Douglas Preston and enjoyed it as well - So their solo efforts can be good and engaging - I just don't know what happened here... How could Preston send this to the publisher? How could an editor approve it? Truly, shockingly bad. I only made it to about page 90 before putting it down. I just couldn't take any more. Instead, I picked up 'The Terror' by Dan Simmons and I am enjoying every word.Time's too precious to waste on bad books."
4,Codex should be your book - buried treasure - should have been rated 5 STARS!,"The team Preston-Child is one of the most wondrous writers of today. Individually, they outshine themselves! The Codex is a treasure - literally and figuratively - three + brothers on a wild ride to find their father's inheritance in the Honduras. It spawned an excellent sequel, Tyrannosaur Canyon, but Codex is amazing - non-stop action as the Broadbents find what treasure really is -One of the most wonderful 'characters' is Hairy Bugger - he features prominently in the plot and readers will really loved Bugger's part.Mr. Preston, keep 'em coming - Fans of good reads - this ranks high up the list.Should have been a 5 star review, but my finger must have slipped!!! 5 stars folks!"
4,Fast Read,"I have read a number of books by Preston and Child & have been rather impressed by all of them so far. I read this book in one day, mostly because it is a quick read and the story moves quickly. At times, the story is seemingly impossible (c'mon, a guy in a tomb in the middle of a rainforest?. But other than that, what is fiction anyway? Certainly not true-to-life experiences. Throughtout, this book is a fun read and I recommend it to those who are fans of this author."
3,He went WHERE with WHAT?,"This is a real ""guy"" story, with all the struggles through the jungle battling hostile natives and a wily ruthless villain and snakes and bugs and jaguars, etc. etc., plus the obligatory beautiful and feisty dame who insists on coming along. And it's fun in its way. But the basic premise struck me as so ridiculous that it was impossible for me to take any of it seriously. A billionaire who is dying of cancer decides to take his entire fortune, including priceless paintings, sculpture, jewels, manuscripts (including the title codex), and various other incredibly valuable items through the Honduran rainforest to an almost impossible ""White City"" in order to bury it all with himself in a big tomb? Heck, if I were crazy enough to want to do that, I'd take a fortune in pharmaceuticals, not artwork. And then when his sons find him, everything is still in good shape, all tucked away there in the rainforest? Yeah, right.But it does make for a fun read."
5,"Fun, fun, fun!","Reading this book was so much fun I could hardly put it down! The characters were well developed, the relationships are interesting, the action is great fun, and I loved the understated humor. Codex is light, fun reading which manages to remind us of a few essentials in human relationships. The characters also ""grow"" into better persons by book's end. Highly recommend this book especially if you have been reading ""heavy stuff."" This is a refreshing break!"
1,"Quick Read, Predictable Plot, Yawn.............","I am a big fan when Preston & Child collaberate (except Still Life with Crows, booooring). However, what's with this Codex book. It has about every thriller cliche out there and just seems like someone's mediocre first novel. Come on Preston we expect great original stuff. Leave this rubbish to the other guys!"
3,"Okay, but predictable...","This is my first experience with this author, so I had no real expectations. I thought the first half of the book moved very well, with much attention to the set-up and story. It started to get a little predictable in the middle. The addition of the indigenous Indian towards the end seemed a bit contrived. All-in-all, an okay read."
4,Great book.,I enjoyed being lost in this jungle adventure. It is a great time passer. It reminds me of the Indiana Jones movies.
5,"Wonderful, entertaining writer",ANything that Preston and Lincoln write is just amazing and the best read you will ever have. I have enjoyed every single book either of them or both as a writing team have created. The story is crafted with care and the style is so fluid and masterful. Sometimes I enjoy reading over a passage again just to savor the expressiveness of the language. You will never be disappointed in whatever you read by either Preston or Lincoln.
2,Artificial Characters,"Artificial characterization of too beautiful people made them unbelievable. The plot was interesting and decently told. However, the descriptions of the persons acting out their roles was Victorian era and did not fit the time table of the story."
4,Entertaining,"This book was well writiten and entertaining. Some of the story was kind of silly, but I enjoyed the book and the search through the jungle. The writing was crisp and I felt like I could see exactly what was described."
4,Fast-paced adventure,"Codex is great entertainment if you like reading adventure novels. The action shifts focus quickly between the point of view of the main characters. The chapters, all 87 of them (yes, 87 chapters in 404 pages), were short, some only two pages long. The introduction of the subplot involving Julian late in the book seems a bit puzzling, but didn't distract from the book overall. All-in-all it was a good book, not great, but very enjoyable."
4,Great Adventure Story,"Douglas Preston has delivered an exciting, engrossing adventure story that will keep you turning pages far into the night. The characters are interesting and there is never a dull moment. A perfect summer read released in the dead of winter. My only question: What happened to Hairy Bugger? Did Tom figure out a way to smuggle him back home?! You will not be disappointed in this book. Sit back and enjoy the ride!"
2,Greetings from the dead,"The premise of the plot was exciting however, I felt that the story was a bit boring. Maxwell Broadbent wants to send his children on the daunting task of searching for their inheritance as he buried himself with his riches in a Central American jungle. The beginning and the end of this novel were intriging but I had trouble staying awake while reading."
4,I thoroughly enjoyed this story!,"After reading Preston's more recent ""Tyrannosour Canyon"" I decided I would have to back up and read his earlier ""The Codex"" in which the characters of Tom Broadbent and Sally first appear.I'm very glad that I did.When I review books of this sort, I try not to write anything that could be considered a ""spoiler"" -- so I won't say a whole lot about the plot.What I will say, is that this is an outstanding adventure, combining archaeology (a common theme of Preston) adventure, corporate corruption, academic hubris, some believably despicable villians, and a realistic love story.Some of the plot ""twists"" are most dramatic -- but are well reasoned and accomplished. I wish that I had read this book prior to ""Tyrannosaur Canyon"" -- but the two novels do stand well on their own.All in all, an outstanding read. Well worth the time."
2,Gloriously Stupid,"So, like, this rich guy's dying of cancer but he still has enough get-up-and-go to schlep $1 billion worth of renaissance art, ancient books, gold and silver, etc to central america, across a vast swamp, up a river guarded by indians with serious anger management issues, to an ancient redoubt deep in the cloudforest. And he's gonna, like, bury himself with all this stuff. And then his three sons (by three different mothers) set out -- individually -- to stop him. And then--Well, I won't give it away. It's an utterly ridiculous story, too silly even for Hollywood (though I'm probably wrong about that). Still, the writing ain't bad, and if your TV's busted, well, this might be a good way to kill a few hours."
5,The Codex,"I loved this book, Jungle adventrues are fun and this one was great. If you want an escape then read this book. I had one problem with something in the end (SPOILER AHEAD) When they knocked out the big bad hunter they didnt take the gun he dropped, they just ran and left him. The threat should have ended there. Other than that it was a fun adventure and of course somewhat educational book."
2,mediocre,"This book was interesting and intriguing, but not at all well-written. A good airplane read, but nothing literary or profound here. And the ending was a bit disappointing"
3,Codex,"A decent adventure novel set in the jungles of South America. The plot is interesting, a couple of the minor characters are very entertaining, but the moral is somewhat heavy handed.If you want to read truly spectacular thriller fiction pick up Relic, Reliquary, Cabinet of Curiosities and Still Life with Crows, by Douglas Preston and his long time partner Lincoln Childs. Codex is allright, but not in a League with the other books I mentioned."
2,Not a strong solo performance,"The review from Publisher's Weekly says:[Half of the writing team responsible for Relic, The Cabinet of Curiosities and other adventure bestsellers takes a solo flight, as Preston's writing partner, Lincoln Child, did in last year's Utopia.]I've read several of Preston and Child's joint efforts as well as Child's solo book, Utopia. This is the weakest effort of them all."
2,Don't waste your time,"Bought this on a recent vacation. I always finish the books I buy. This is my first review. I felt this book was so bad that I had to warn others.The story seemed interesting at first. I kept hoping it would get better, it didn't and then I figured I would see it through anyway.The only strong point is that it is a semi-fast paced read.Very predictable, bad characters and development,useless bable(fill) and the story development is just.......crap. No other way to put it. I like adventure, but this seemed amatuerish in every respect. Just plain bad writing."
4,Predictable but Entertaining,"An eccentric millionaire takes a half a billion dollars worth of treasure, buries it with himself in a tomb and leaves instructions for his three sons to find it if they want to claim their inheritance. Each son has his own reasons for wanting the treasure but central to the plot is an ancient Mayan manuscript (codex) that contains ancient and undiscovered medical cures.Typical treasure hunt story with predictable characters and a predictable outcome. But author Douglas Preston writes it in a way that makes the reading fast and enjoyable. If you haven't read any of Preston's works this would be a good, quick place to start. I liked some of his other books a little better but you won't be disappointed with ""The Codex""."
3,Shallow but action-packed,"I don't quite know how to sum up this book. It kept my attention, but it also annoyed me. Sally's character could be quite irritating, though never enough to make you want to stop reading. The storyline, though a little odd, kept you interested until the very end. Most of the characters were good, if a little grating and unrealistic from time to time. I would say it's definitely worth the time it takes to read, as long as you don't expect anything earth-shattering and soul-searching. It would make a great, shallow, action-adventure movie."
3,"some good, some bad","The Codex starts off with a great premise. Billionaire Max Broadbent, who is dying of cancer, disappears and leaves a video for his three sons. In order to get their inheritance, which he packed away with him, they have to find him in a jungle in South America. Sounds great. And although the novel has some good points, there is much that detracts from it. One is believability, which this novel lacks in abundance. The other thing that thoroughly annoyed me to no end was the presence of the evil, diabolical, shadowy pharmaceutical company. This has become so tired and trite in novels and movies that it makes me physically ill when I come across it. I would hope for some more originality from Mr. Preston. At any rate, the novel has many twists and turns, which were not always believable.Carl Alves - author of Two For Eternity"
3,"Fast-paced Adventure, Fun & Quick Read","Having long ago readRelic, I thought I'd give this one a try. I found another fast-paced, over-the-top adventure set against the jungles and lost cities of Central America. All the ""Indiana Jones stuff"" is really minor overall, but the adventure through the jungle keeps the pages turning. Of course, everything seems tailor written for an aciton-packed, barely believable movie, but that's what books likes this are about. A fun, fictional escape that relaxes you mind. Want to read more on the lost cities of Central and South America? TryThe Lost City of Z: A Tale of Deadly Obsession in the Amazon,Lost Cities of North & Central America&Lost Cities and Ancient Mysteries of South America."
3,Comfort food--literary style,"A classic adventure story with the usual weaknesses normally found in this style. Still if you know what the book is going in you won't be disappointed and will probably enjoy it. A quick read, the story doesn't take itself too seriously, and comes to a satisfying end."
3,Entertaining Pulp,"The Codex is a fun read. It won't challenge the reader intellectually, or make one pause at the beauty of a passage, but it's an entertaining story.The characters are all out of central casting - the pure-hearted hero, the whiny intellectual, the spiritual hippie, the drop-dead gorgeous perfect girl, the sinister bad guy, and of course a few Noble Savages. Yes, it's all been done before, and much better - hello AC Doyle - but it passes the time and you'll probably enjoy most of it.The author has a weird way with some phrases, and his dialogue is shockingly poor at times. The strengths of the story are the setting, and the adventurous journey. This is exactly what a SCIFI made-for-TV movie would be if it were a novel."
3,"More enlightening than watching TV, but really just ""ok"" or mediocre for a book","Many other people have given feedback on the plot. To me it was highly predictable, I knew what was going to happen after just a few chapters. It was entertaining, but not a book I would specifically recommend."
4,I expected...,"I really expected more from this book however it was very entertaining. I listened to the CD which was done exceptionally well. The ending certainly had a nice twist to it and laughable also from the stand point of ""he who waits"". Read it. I am sure you will enjoy it."
2,Disappointing.,"I was rather disappointed in this book. The information on the history relating to books was interesting, I'm not the least involved in computer games so that was lost on me, and the story rather plodded along without real suspense, without a murder, and with a horribly-done ending. I definitely wouldn't compare it to Di Vinci Code in terms of a page-turning read but if you've nothing else on the shelf or are stuck at the airport, it's okay."
3,Bland escapist fare,"The theme of the book is about finding a treasure (a medicinal codex plus other arty knick-knacks) buried in a tomb in an all but inaccessible place in the Amazon jungle. The premise on the blurb seemed interesting and the author seems to be able to tell the story in a compelling way which keeps the readers attention. However, the story lacks a twist or a punchline - I found my interest flagging after the first 100 or so pages - nearly the whole of the plot is described by then. The story itself gets bogged down into a repetition of all the standard facts/myths about Amazon - each repeated 2-3 times for effect. Cue the obligatory torture with piranhas and knife fight with a jaguar. It all felt as if the author was being paid to produce his quota of 400 odd pages for a story that could be told in 150 pages. Get it if you want to kill 3-4 hours in an airport."
2,I did not want a white book,"I didn't have a choice on what it looked like nor does it tell you. As it is, I got a plain white book that looks more for wedding photos than my scenery photos. On that aspect I am disappointed. Because of this, I won't be ordering another one."
5,Best Soap Dish Ever!,"I cannot believe how cheap this great soap dish is. This has been the only soap dish that satisfied me 100%. No more worris about drainage and no more searches. Thanks to the rim/edge, the soap won't slip from the dish either. I already bought 4, and I'm buying another 4 just in case the company should discontinue it. This is how much I like this design. Just try one; you won't regret it."
4,"Not the best poetry, but Ursula is still distinctive","Like her prose, Le Guin's poetry is thoughtful: every word is magical, reflecting the sort of dependency on words that exists in her Earthsea books. This belief in the primacy of language certainly makes her a better writer. I would never compare this poetry to any of the great ""poets"" (although her prose is a different matter), but there are in this book many beautiful nuggets that anyone could respect, not just someone who loves Le Guin like I do."
2,driving shoe?..,"they are not really comfortable and just missing something. look worse than on the picture. i was going to send them back but then just got too lazy. probably a good pair to have in the car for driving, but not to wear."
3,Defense attorney time,This book is disappointing in that Osborne does not reflect very much on the 1995 seaso except in aknee jerk defnse attorney manner. He is more thoughtful about this controversial season in his later book FAITH IN THE GAME.
2,The worst of Dr. Tom's three books.,"It's a little too defensive, a little too closed up. I think, with time to look back, he creates a more persuasive work with Faith in the Game. Coupled with Osborne's eventual retirement two years later, the book seems even more like a cover than it might as first. I imagine it was a hard work to complete with full honesty.Nebraska fans may love this chapter in the Osborne trilogy the most, however, because it acts as a direct refutation to the media's charges during the 1995 national championship season."
1,Poorly Researched & Executed,"Typical of most of Roger Williams' books, he fails to provide factual content behind the improvements mentioned in the book. Rather, the book does not actually explain ""How To Improve"" your TR6, but rather it glosses over the products available from a handful of UK suppliers while largely ignoring the offerings of other suppliers and also ignoring every US based supplier of uprated components.Want to know what camshaft / carburettor combination is right for you? Do not bother with this book, there are no answers for you here. Want to know which tubular exhaust manifold you should use, afterall there are at least 12 different ones available between the UK and USA. Williams only presents one these manifolds and barely goes into detail.A waste of $20, Roger Williams' give me my money back!"
5,Great portable Hard drive for the MacBook computer,"The G-tech G-Drive portable is a excellent piece of equipment, sturdy and was easily recognized by my new Macbook. Instructions were very clear on how to partioned it and use it. It's very small, well built and portable. I recommend getting the largest capacity you can afford."
3,Outdated,"Admittedly, this album is great Bowie 101. It was the second album of Mr. Bowie's that I ever purchased and it sold me forever as a hardcore fan. Ten years ago, you couldn't really do any better so far as greatest hits albums go (with the possible exception of Bowie Singles 68-93). However, since the release of Best of Bowie, it seems like kind of a waste of money when, for the same price or perhaps a little extra, one can purchase a much more complete, up-to-date album.This is a fantastic album in and of itself, but for my money, it's kind of obsolete considering what else is available."
3,interesting,"Interesting blend of commercial hits. To clear things up, I believe China Girl was writen by Bowie's friend Iggy Pop. And it's about Iggy's then wife. Don't let a misunderstanding lead you to think the album or Bowie is racist."
4,great cd,"I have always liked bowie ever since getting the space oddessy album way back in the early 70,s it great"
4,If you can find it well worth it,"This is a CD that has grown on me. At first I sort of skipped about half way through during like Heroes, Young Americans and Fashion. I'll admit I only wanted to hear the ones they play on the radio. But as I listened more, I started to get into the whole CD and even found myself looking for more Bowie. My biggest complaint now is its missing so many good songs. Oh well."
4,Great cd by david bowie but missing a few good tracks,"I like this cd but had it included the original ""Fame"" recording & starman i would of liked it even more. Fame90 is a dance remix that i could do without. I wrote a letter to david bowie in the early 70s & he wrote me back. The postmark was london. My 2 top favorite songs on this cd is space oddity & golden years. Changesbowie is timeless classic music."
4,Changesbowie,"Overall a good compilation. I would expecially recommend ""Rebel Rebel,"" ""Fashion,"" and ""Let's Dance."""
4,The Great Green Turkey Creek Monster,This was the book that I remember reading to my two sons the most often. It is a great funny story that holds their attention. I would say it is best for preschool to first grade levels. I just bought a copy to give to a young friend.
5,"WHAT A WAY TO ""BABY YOUR BABY""","THIS ALBUM IS FILLED WITH GREATNESS. WHAT A VOICE AND WHAT A TALENT, THANKS ENGE FOR SHARING IT ALL WITH YOUR PUBLIC. THE RANGE OF THIS MAN IS PHENOMINALFROM THE SOFTNESS OF A WHISPER TO A BOOMING RANGE THAT CAN KNOCK YOUR SOCKS OFF. GREAT ALBUM."
4,"Just because you can read, doesn't mean your comprehension is any good","There are three negative reviews to this book, which largely all rehash the argument ""OMG! HATE IS BAD! THIS BOOK IS BAD! NOOOO!""As near as I can figure, these people looked at the title and stopped looking.To sum up... this book isn't about ""teaching kids to hate"". And it's not about hating either. It's about children being angry and making up at the end with the mother's sage advice ""You should really just talk to her"". (What an idea! When you're angry at somebody, talk to them, get their side of the story!) It's about resolving conflicts peacefully with your words, and about not being too scared to make amends.Even if your family doesn't use the word ""hate"", that doesn't mean your children don't have those same feelings. They do - you've just robbed them of a way to express themselves.I did find the artwork is a little dull, though."
3,A honest book about misunderstandings.,"This is a kids point of view about a misunderstanding and the emotions that are felt by both sides. This young girl hate hates her friend and can't figure out why her friend is being so rotten to her. Her mom tells her to just ask her why but she is too embarassed and just won't bring herself to confront her friend and says, ""I couldn't, I'd rather die. No- if that's the way she's going to be, it's quite okay with me."" Her attitude is that of a stubborn child and I think most kids can relate to this character. Everything is smoothed over in the end and the moral shows that communication is key. Illustrations are basic sketches with only red, yellow, pink and brown colors."
1,A,"As a parent, I was very very disappointed in the content of this book. To have a 2nd grader read this book is very disturbing. If they are learning about hate in the 2nd grade, then what will they learn in the 3rd grade, how to kill??? This book should be banned from schools. In our home,we do not advocate or teach our children to hate anyone. The world has enough problems. Now, we know why we don't understand what's going on with our children.... Look at what they are given in school to read and the teachers who give them this kind of material to read."
1,Idiot's Guide to Cat Ownership,"That should be the title of this book! I don't agree with the 9-12 grade reading. There is only 39 pages of text, in HUGE letters, like an early reader book, so there is very little info. There's a 2 page spread with a photo of a cat, with words and arrows identifying the parts of a cat- Whiskers, paws, ears! Two pages of Quick facts about cats- short blurb describing things like their sense of smell, hearing, balance, etc. A page of words to know ""breeder-(BREED-ur) someone who breeds and raises cats or other animals Vaccination-(vak-suh-NAY-shun)- you get the gist. The info is elementary, and you can get this and more from other ragdoll cat books.Unless you're ten years old and deciding to buy a >$500 cat, avoid wasting your money on this book!"
3,Not for owners,"I read this book and was displeased with how it's pictures do not represent the true nature of the ragdoll breed. The information, although correct, was not usefull at all. The book has nothing about owning, raising, breeding, showing, or grooming this breed. I recomend this book only to those who are looking to learn about what the ragdoll cat looks like. \"
5,WONDERFUL BOOK FOR CHILDREN AGES 6 - 12,This is a very factual and easy to read book for young children interested in learning more about the Ragdoll cat and cats in general. Beautiful pictures. Both my daughters loved it and still pick it up just to gaze at the gorgeous fluffy ones!!
5,Just what I needed,"The Werner AC10-20-02 Long Body Aluminum Ladder Jacks were just what I needed. I am a do-it-yourselfer who was rebuilding and shingling a garage roof. I needed to have an easy scaffold to do the shingling so that I did not have to keep moving ladders as I shingled. These ladder jacks did the trick. They were easy to assemble and adjust to provide a level scaffold. In addition the retainer ""clips"" were great for keeping a narrower scaffold from moving around. That provides comfort when working off the ground. They are very strong as both my father and I were able to be on the same scaffold at the same time and we both weigh over 200 lbs. I would recommend these for anyone that needs a good, sturdy, affordable pair of ladder jacks."
5,Ladder Jack is a safety cause,"I really love the Werner Ladder Jacks and use them in my home renovation business. The locking clamps really grip my pics and stages so that no slippage occurs when work is being done. Very adjustable and quite light when carrying it up and down the ladder. Built to last and I never keep them under cover and yet, being aluminum, they look and function as new."
3,All the Social Sciences Reveiwed,"Opportunities in Social Sciences explains this discipline which deals with aspects of social activity and goes beyond enabling us to look beyond facts to ""values"". The author, Marek, provides help in choosing a career and finding a job by describing each discipline and discussing employment opportunities, salaries, and educational requirements for each field."
5,Best Glue stick I've used,"I've used the Pioneer Photo Glue stick for several projects and have been very pleased with this product. It went on smoothly and the photos and other items stuck well to the surface that they were being glued to and there was no ""bleed"" through to the front of the photos.The glue stick is acid free and we felt that it was safe to use for the ""Ancestor Photo Albums"" that we created as gifts for our 6 grown children. We used the glue stick for both photos and paper labels that we had typed on the computer. I would recommend this product over other glue sticks that I have used that did not stick well to the pages."
2,Not a good lens,"Except the lens range, the picture quality is not at all good. Any picture taken indoors the shadow parts are all grainy and clearly visible. I am really disappointed with this investment. Save some more money and buy any other good lens."
4,autofocus is not working well,"haven't study why the autofocus doesn't work with my t2i body in dusky area with flash, maybe my problem."
2,Auto Focus Motor did not work,The auto-focus motor on the lens did not work and I had to return it. I love the range of the lens but I was disappointed it did not work.
2,Soft at all focal lengths,"I was dissappointed with the performance of this lens when paired with my Canon T2i. I found most of my images to be soft through all focal lengths, even when stopped down to f/8 or higher. I returned this lens and purchased the Tamron 70-300mm with Vibration Compensation and I am much happier with its performance. My advice would be to spend the extra money if you intend to shoot past the 70mm focal length with this lens and get the other Tammy."
5,Very nice bang for the dollar!,"You get more than you pay for. Yes, the Tamron AF 18-200 is not the best all around lens out there, but for less than $200, you get a very good lens, that can be used for pretty much any situation. Perfect fit for my Canon T3i and also ships with a lens hood. Taking very nice pictures thus far and will get the majority of my time, with using my T3i."
5,LOVE,Just got this lens for Christmas and I love it! Very happy with it so far and can't wait to take a lot more pics with it!
2,You get what you pay for,"Picture quality wise, it was OK, but not great. And it broke after about 3 years. So, I will not buy it again and don't recommend it to you either."
5,Great All Purpose Zoom Lens,My wife wanted a good mid range zoom lens for her Canon camera that was not as big as her other zoom lens. This lens allows her to take picture close and far and it is not so big and bulky as other lens. I highly recommend this lens.
4,Good Entry Level Zoom Lenses,I am new to SLR and wanted to check the larger zoom range without spending too much. These lenses have fully allowed me to do that. Having said that the lack of a Vibration Reduction is sometimes a little annoying. If you have more money available I would for one with the VR feature. Otherwise these lenses work great.
2,The Auto Focus is not working properly,"I bought the lens, and was very anxious, it worked fine at first, i was able to use the Auto Focus and get lots of great photos, however after about 2 weeks the AF started to malfunction, sometime it will focus and other times it will not, so I am shooting most of my photos using the manual focus, until i can purchase another lens, this time I will buy the Nikon lens."
4,Walk around lens.,"This is my go to lens now. Keep it on camera most of the time. Fast enough for most photo work, and enough zoom for most situations."
4,Excellent All Round Lens,Extremely well rounded lens. Does away with the need of changing lenses. Only the AF is a bit noisy compared to SIGMA or Canon lenses.
5,"Tamron, The only lens you'll need.",This is a wonderful product. I purchased it for my Nikon D-60 camera. The one that Nikon has is three times as much. I used it in the store and was going to get it. I glad I waited and checked on-line for something of equal value and quality without the price. This is a great lens. Well worth a look.
4,Good all-around lens for the money,"My Nikon D90 came packaged with this lens and I've found that this lens can really do it for most occasions. It's 18-200mm flexibility allows for a variety of shooting situations without the hassles of swapping out lenses on the fly. It takes sharp, crisp and clear images and is fully compatible with the D90. However I rated only 4 stars simply because of the fact that this lens does not have the VR (Vibration Reduction) feature of Nikkor lenses. To what extent this may or may not be an issue depends on the person shooting the picture but to me, its a convenience I can get by but would be nice if it had it. So, if you are looking for a lens for your Nikon DSLR, check this one out...Great flexibility (18-200mm) for most situations and good value for the money."
2,Very disappointing,"I know you can't get something for nothing -- and I guess I forgot that when I ordered the Tamron 18-200 for my Nikon D70. It seems like a great idea -- but one must remember that a super zoom must make many trade-offs. My first bad experience was trying to put two Tiffen filters on. At 18mm it created a black shadow on the sensor. I then started noticing the lack of sharpness and distortion compared to the stock Nikon 18-70 lens. For most of my shots, it probably is OK. But when one counts -- I don't think it will deliver."
1,Photo,"Never recieved the lens, so I just went with the canon 55-250 with IS and man that lens for the price and quality is outstanding."
1,if you buy a 200 dollar lens you get a 200 dollar lens,"so i guess ill give it the benefit of the doubt and say it took good pictures at 18mm to about 70mm, but after that you might as well digital zoom it. i bought this lens only a month ago and its already toast. i pulled it out of my bag this weekend to shoot with and and the mount was completely detached and broken. so i popped it back together (because its made of the same plastic as a coke bottle) and the focus ring was locked. i tried and tried and tried to get it to move but it ended up breaking again. this time the zoom ring was locked too. i will never buy a tameron lens again. you cant afford to buy cheap."
2,Slow or non functional auto-focus,"I should have listened to the other reviews that stated poor auto focus on this model. Indoor or low light shots resulted in the lens rotating back and forth and sometimes never focusing. I am not expert enough, nor do I have time with 4 small children running around to spend the time to manual focus. THe kids are gone before I would be done focusing! :)"
5,excellent choise,Simply love this lens. Gives a very unique experience in very easy to use way. I have Nikon D40x and this lens fits just fine and work perfectly. Also has a excelent quality and versatility. Really love this lens.
4,BETTER THAN EXPECTED,"I bought this lens a month ago and for my CANON T2i. It performs like advertised. Great zoom, very good build quality, light weight and very classy feel. Easily mounts to camera, and feel good in my hands for shooting. Since is doesn't have [image stabilizer] I usually only use it during the day in good light. Use of a tripod is optional if your hands are steady. Close-ups are crisp and even when I crop the photo, everything is clean. It is now my all around lens for trips. I have a high speed lens for indoors and museums.I just finished shooting some great photo's using the shutter priority setting on the T2i. I was amazed at the clarity and the color was also great. For longer shots [over 100mm] I double the shutter speed to help control stability."
4,Unbeatable value for money,"Great product, and compact. The perfect choice for a holiday trip without carrying a large volume of photography equipment. The AF is not the quietest, but it is not too bad either. Cannot beat this value for money!"
1,Very fuzzy,Disappointed with the lens. Not clear at all and very slow to focus. I returned it immediately.
5,Good quality lens,I like not having to change lens very often. Pictures taken with this lens have the high quality that I expected.
2,Grey Market product from Amazon - Beware!,"According to my invoice, the item was sold directly by Amazon.com, LLC. However, when I shipped the item in for warranty repair, Tamron informed me the lens did not have a serial number which probably meant it was a grey market product. Because there was no serial number, the warranty was voided.I don't know where this serial number is supposed to be, but I doubt it fell off. This can only mean Amazon is sourcing this product from a questionable source hoping that there will be no need for repair.Amazon did however return the item for a full refund. They did not explain how the item could come without a serial number.I don't know how this happened but it does cause me to be concerned about where they are getting their products and if they are going to be covered by warranty."
2,Focusing Problem,"Sadly, I am returning this lens. Shooting in low light, it can't seem to autofocus. Using my bedroom overhead light and focusing on something across the room, it will zoom in and out while it flashes to find its focus, and when it is done with its process, it is very blurry."
2,Cannot Focus,"I was very disappointed with this lens. I purchased it to replace my Canon 28-135 IS as it was too bulky plus I would get a bit more zoom.Close in this lens takes some good shots, I posted a few at pbase. The problem was that at anything over 150mm everything out past 15 - 20' was a blur. I tried the 28-135 at similar focal lengths and the IS beat it hands down. Granted there is that 'IS' function, but even with it off it was much better.I tried this lens on both my Rebel (A300) and my Rebel XT (A350) getting the same results.End result, Tamron 18-200 is going back (just packaged it with the RMA# right now). I am keeping the IS, I've grown to re-like it. Will either get the 70-300 IS (which is why I am out at Amazon right now), Canon 100mm Macro, or the Sigma 105mm Macro in its place.I would NOT recommend this lens to anyone."
1,Doesnt work well with K-7,I havent tried this lens with any other camera but I'm assuming that its not compatible with Pentax K-7. The distortion was off the charts at just about anything less than 100mm. I returned this and got a Pentax 50-200mm and it works like a charm.
2,Not very good,"I am a fairly serious photographer, and I have a pretty extensive lens selection. I wanted an all-in-one lens for days that I didn't have specific shoots planned, but wanted to keep a camera with me just in case. I have used Tamron lenses in the past, and the ones I've used have been pretty good. Unfortunately this one isn't nearly as nice.The main issue I have with it is that it can't focus very well indoors. Now I realized before I bought the lens that it probably wouldn't focus that quickly, or quitely, but I'm telling you, it has real issues focusing in low light. Even with a speedlight attached to the camera it still has issues.Sometimes even in good light it takes it a couple of passes to focus, so you have to really pay attention to make sure you're getting an in-focus picture."
4,A Good Lens for Everyday Stuff,"I bought this lens for the zoom range ist's lightness and ease of handling.Is it Dead Sharp? No but plenty sharp for general use. After all it is not an ""L"" lens.Good lens for a fair price that will do for day to day knocking around."
5,All in one.,I bought this lens to shoot a wedding of a friend of mine. It was the only lens I needed. I used the zoom from the loft down to the alter and the same lens at the alter close up. Worked great!
2,Nice lens but not in low light or at infinity,"Nice lens except that it has trouble finding focus in low light and certainly won't focus at all at infinity (e.g., landscape photos). I sent it in for warranty repair, but it didn't seem to help. Granted, I can still take photos if I switch to manual focus, but it is annoying to constantly have to switch back and forth."
4,comment on buy-back program,"Well, my book has now traveled. I thought it would be perfect candidate for buy-back as it has been well-cared for and lightly used. The book jacket does show shelf-wear. I am retiring and down-sizing my library, but I guess the Lord intends for me to keep this book as it was rejected. Another book my son ordered for a class which was NEVER used and in perfect condition was also rejected. Puzzling, but I thought to warn others who may be considering buying books with the idea of being able to turn them around when they're no longer required. Other books that were pristine inside but were soft jacket and so the covers were not great were also rejected."
1,This is actually a horrible price.,This is double the cost of getting this at a craft store and nearly double of what it costs at other websites. Total ripoff.
4,Great for adding pages but the screws are weird,"I needed to add pages to a portfolio so this package was what I needed but adding the screws was awkward and too high for just five pages. I'll keep the extra screws for expanding later. If you need to add screws, you will need to keep one finger on one side and then use a screwdriver on the other for a tight fit."
1,sent a different item than the one I ordered,"I looked around to match a scrapbook I had at home, to give my grandkids matching scrapbooks of their own.I found this site which had a photo of the exact book I was wanting. The description was the same. Ordered them and received totally different books from what appeared on the site.Very disappointing to say the least. I know not to order from someone who doesn't make sure that what's presented on the site is what they send to the customer. This vendor was Adorama, selling on Amazon.Lou"
5,Says Pop,WOW is the first thought that comes to mind when first listening to this band. I've never heard this type of music before but it very fresh and refreshing. This band has talent and i'm sure we'll see them someday soon on a major lable. Can't wait for The Wee Hours Review to come out!
5,great my expectations,just what i needed fits my car just perfectly i recomend this product works just like oem expectations thanks for bussiness
5,One of My Favorite Made for TV Movies,"I had taped this movie on a VHS tape years ago when it aired on TV. I watched it again recently and loved it just as much as the first time I saw it. It is a movie I talk about often. I regretted that I hadn't transferred the VHS version onto DVD as I watched it recently, never thinking there was a DVD copy out there. Naturally, I was thrilled to learn it was indeed out on DVD. The ending makes the whole movie although the writing for the story leading up to it is excellent also."
1,Retro 70's,"1995 edition with 1970's figures and automobiles. Classiclly, this has been an architectural resource book for any office doing presentation work, though, today the content is dated."
4,"Good, yet dated, reference.","This book makes a great reference addition to your library; however, it is a bit date. Even the newest edition could use an upgrade to the 21st Century."
5,One of my baby's faves!,"My baby is 8 months (not sure why they labeled this 6 months...) and this is one of her favorite teethers. It's easy to hold, and the entire thing has good textures for chewing. The little balls for rattling are kinda fun, too. (altho her other rattles are certainly more effective, she does like to stop chewing and shake it, which is better than dropping it like she does with other teethers)The plastic case is a nice touch, too, keeps it clean if it falls into the dark depths of the diaper bag."
5,I wish I had bought this one first!,"I bought several other teethers before finally deciding to spring for this one. I wish I had started with this one! My kid loves this one, it's easy to hold and you can't put it in your mouth the wrong way (there is no wrong way) It even comes with a plastic case so it won't get dirty in the diaper bag.My baby is 8 months with no teeth, so I'm not sure what the point of the ""4 months"" label is."
5,THE BEST TEETHER OUT THERE,I got this for my son when he was about 10 months old. He loved it!! My only regret was that I didn't get it sooner!
5,Baby love it!,My baby has been teething for what seems like forever! He loves this! He can hold it and try to suck on the tip like a pacifier. Great size for 3 month old who is just getting the idea of grasping.
1,BPA FREE????,"I ordered this and then promptly returned it. No where on the packaging does it state that this item is BPA free. I know Amazon is saying it is, and after searching the internet, it is listed other places as being BPA free... but the packaging does not say it. So... don't trust that it really is BPA free... especially since it was made in China with the case has words in Chinese on it, not English."
2,A fancy rattle...,"The little teething nub on this is so small. My son hardly ever put it in his mouth, he simply enjoyed shaking it like a rattle because it has little beads inside. I thought it was a cool idea, but it wasn't a hit like I had hoped..."
1,Don't waste your money,I have no clue how this even qualifies as a teether. Do not buy it there is nothing for my little one to rub his gums on.
2,Not a favorite teether for us....,"I purchased this teether after my 9-month old decided that the squishy dropper part of the infant Tylenol bottle was his favorite thing to chew on. I searched high and low for something similar he might like since he wasn't a fan of the ever-popular Sophie the Giraffe teether. I came across this teether and thought it might be similar and work for him. Unfortunately, he isn't a fan of it. I wish they made a teether that was a tested, safe version of the Tylenol bottle since it seems that a lot of babies like to chew on that (but I won't let him since I'm paranoid...)"
4,"Combi Teether, 6 months","My daughter was teething at about 5-6 months and she used this sparingly. She would chew on it and then just drop it to find something else to chew on. It's durable and easy to clean and will keep her busy for a few minutes at a time, but that's about it."
3,probably works great...,"my son won't use it. i bought this when my son started teething molars, it seems to be made of good sturdy materials but he just won't chew on it. however he won't chew on ANYTHING but his fingers! i think it'd be better for a pacifier user since they're used to this type of thing in the mouth but he stopped using a pacifier at 6 months."
3,My son didn't like this,It's a great idea but my son never really liked it. Other kids might though. I think it depends on your child.
5,best teether ever!,I bought this teether for my 6 month old. IT IS PERFECT! It is the perfect size for her hands and her mouth! I have bought two more to have at all times. I also love that it comes with a hard case to put it in! I love it and will tell all my friends about it!
2,My daughter just not interested,"I bought this when my daughter was about 6 months, over a year ago. Through this entire time she was never interested in it. It's a good idea, but just didn't work for me. She uses it occasionally as a light rattle. That's all."
5,Must Have,"What would we have done without this? When my son was 7-9 months, we'd strap it to him like a pacifer when we went out. He's never been a paci baby, always a biter. So good for teething little ones. By 10-11 months he was over it, but he was onto cutting molars then, and this must not reach back that far. It was so soothing for him, and it's dishwasherable."
3,Great bargain,I bought this cd because i had extra money on my account. I listened to it and liked the background. It was really cool. If you put it on at a party its sure to bring it to life.
5,A ground-breaking educational work,"This work is a ""must"" for any veteran or new-comer to the profession. It provides the first and ONLY comprehensive, methodical approach to the investigative process while also opening the readers mind to the theories of Truth that every investigator works with --but may not even realize!"
2,Not worth the money.,"I expected more for $38. In my opinion, the book was filled with too many ""war stories,"" all with obvious 'aha' moments. In essence, the book boils down to: Carefully read all the information available, talk to as many witnesses as possible, examine & sketch & photograph the crime scene and write a readable, thorough report. Again, that's my opinion."
4,The Music of Nature: listen,"These and similar atmospheric recordings seem to have several types of buyer: those who want a sedative or sleep-inducer to calm their agitation or put them to sleep; those who want the hear an anthology of sounds they expected from watching nature shows or reading illustrated nature books; those who have a meditative ear of the music of nature and human ambience, like that of John Cage; and those who want an exotic background for routine daily activities to put themselves in another place, as if living in a hut in the field. I seek no application other than an appreciation of new sounds. I just listen to the virtual volume of space. If you are of like mind, this recording should be a worthy addition to your collection, like those of the splendid Ryko Cape Cod series."
1,Please give us SAMPLES,I'd be able to make a better decision on buying the CD if Amazon would provide samples. Not just for this CD but for any like this.
1,Beaks across a blackboard!,Horrible! After 10 minutes I had to shut it down. The rain irritated like finger nails across a blackboard. Was totally unable to visualize rain. Don't waste your money on this one.
3,"not impressed - Borrow, not Buy Book","Not impressed with this book. The story and pictures are cute, but this book didn't keep my daughter's (she's 2 1/2) attention. The pictures are not colorful which probably didn't help to keep her attention. I would suggest borrowing this book from the library instead of purchasing it."
1,not satisfied,Please check your records and see what actually happened with the process in purchasing the so called product and then ask yourself honestly if I can rate your product. Please don't contact me again!
5,painting is great for you senior citizen!,"great price for hours of entertainment, and then you have the feeling of accomplishment as well. a feel good product."
1,Mid leading,Product appears to be a complete kit. It is just a Gauage. Was needing the complete kit that is pictured. Could have ben displayed better.
1,miss leading,i bought this thinking it was the full kit i was kinda upset when i recieved it and there was only a gauge. I guess the gauge is ok but i wish i had the whole kit
2,Cheap price = cheap gauge.,Buy this instead http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DZKWEQ/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title it looks to be a much better made product. I bought both and that is my opinion so far.
5,Does the job well and for cheap.,"I bought this item to replace a broken gauge on our air tank. The gauge is really well made and feels sturdy. It doesn't feel flimsy like other gauges like the one the tank had. It installed very easily of course. After all it's a tire gauge. These aren't brain surgery to install. After some time to use it, the gauge is accurate and does the job it is designed to do very well. So for 5 bucks you get your worth easily."
4,A jewel of a mystery,"Wynton was right, this is a modern day masterpiece. We must first remove ourselves from the expected before we take the journey of ""Murder at the Butt,"" this is a refreshing change from the ordinary. I hope this author continues to share his talents with his fans. The preface is my favorite page. It speaks of true love and the power of one night so long ago. Whoever inspired this section must be very special to the author.Ken Mask is deep and everyone who reads this will get insight to the thinking of a great mind."
1,This was awful,"Riddled with misspellings, dropped plot lines, inanities .... and his epilogue and bio ... I've never read someone more in love with the sound of his own voice."
1,Only because I don't know how to give it no stars,"This man is not a writer. It takes more than words to write a book. It takes more than words to create characters. It takes a wordsmith, a person who can pick you up and drop you in the middle of another world and have you believe it. There was nothing I believed about this book."
5,reviewer,the literary references are wonderful and the use of narrative flashback and flash forwards are precise and dynamic...fresh and exciting...
5,Little dog little puppy little coffee little cuppy,"Magical. Lyrical. I still carry around my battered paperback copy and guard it religiously. A world of children, a poem strewn throughout. ""Little book little pages, little worker little wages."" Each page having other little stories going on to discover. Not a linear book, so with repeated readings you discover more intricacies."
5,You've Gotta Get This One!,"This CD is really special. A great collection of Christmas songs with that unique Caribbean flavour for a real departure from the usual North American/European classics. All different moods from ballads to exuberant dance-ables and mellow jazzy stuff, too. All Caribbean cultures are represented here with new and old songs. The liner notes alone are worth the price of the CD! In addition to the lyrics are factual notes about each song explaining the cultural and historical aspects -- I learned a lot just from reading them! And Machel's Soca Santa is now an absolute staple in our house every Christmas. You can't not dance to it and my nieces in Boston play it all year 'round! Give yourself a great gift and buy this CD!"
3,Great support from Kodak,"Waiting on delivery of my frame so I can't say anything about the product quality yet. But Kodak support has to be the best and quickest I have ever dealt with.Using their website I Emailed their support team my concerns that I have read about having to use a subscription service to activate it, and this service was no longer available. All I want is a stand alone frame for now.Within 24hours I got a response with an updated firmware for the frame and instructions on how to install it. This renders the frame as a stand alone product only and not require any type of Internet subscription, just load pictures via the cf card.Great support that many other companys would do well to follow. I only hope they decide to develop the market for displaying digital pictures. Given the number of digital cameras now it seems ridiculous there are so few products like this."
2,NEEDS MUCH MORE IMPOROVEMENT!,"The idea is great, it just needs some major improvements. The most glaring problem is the NON-PORTABILITY FACT. This unit plugs into the wall only and has no battery power to be able to take it with you to show off your pictures. That majorly [stinks]! Another major pain is the fact that the item only has PHONE JACK hookups. Look, it has to connect to the internet to get information and pictures anyway and PHONEJACKS take forever so they should also add the option of ETHERNET/NETWORK hookup. If they could add those features to the new model when it comes out I would be much more intrested in trying it again but this one has got to go. If you want PORTABILITY and SPEED, than you do not want this model. Wait for them to improve on their new technology. And hey, even better, How about support for more than just COMPACT FLASH cards too? Back to the re-drawing board for this one!"
1,Piece of crap!,"This thing's a total waste of time and money. My wife blew it big time with this gift!!! Techology, smology. Nothing but a tiny little lcd screen---no brains to it at all. Don't waste your money on one of these--even if you get it used."
1,Annoying product,"I bought this product last year. I live in Argentina. When it arrived I try and try to see my pics I load in my Kodak picture card and it was imposible. It works ok but only I can see the pics Kodak introduce in the memory.Its really the worst product I bought ever.Worst of all Kodak says now I can register the product online.Never again Kodak, never again!!"
3,Smart but still needs some work,"I've had the Smart Picture Frame for a couple of weeks. The picture quality is high, the controls are simple and elegant, and the StoryBox.com customer service is fast and helpful. However there are some ""bugs."" First they need to make it absolutely clear that a 1-year subscription is required beyond the initial free 6 months for the frame to work at all. Second I doubt the claim that 90% of the country is covered by the StoryBox.com service provider; I live in a greater metropolitan area of 250,000 and there is no local access number. However StoryBox set me up with on 800 number after I contacted customer service. The ""smart"" ability to maintain the frame remotely from the web site is somewhat spoiled by the lack of a battery back-up (requiring a manual reset of the time if it loses power) and manual intervention can be required if it fails to connect to the network."
3,"As a standalone viewer it works great, but...","Kodak had a good idea here, but shutting down the Internet connectivity option seriously limits its appeal. With that said, the screen is EXCELLENT compared to other electronic frames. Why have a picture frame on your mantle with one picture when you can have one with HUNDREDS (now that the cost of compact flash cards have come way down)? As a standalone viewer this thing rocks and I'll be buying another soon."
4,A great idea though a little pricy,"I bought two of these a year ago. Gave one to my parents and kept the other. They were actually a lot LESS expensive then and I kind of wish I had gotten another. I never needed the subscription service so it's demise is no issue for me. The frame looks great. Picture quality is very good with the caveat that the screen does not have a good wide angle of view. This won't bother you if you put it on your desk but might be an issue with the frame on a coffee table or wall mounted as the picture quality suffers at off axis viewing angles. Loading images with the CF cards is easy and you can leave the CF card inserted to provide additional image storage. Of the ones on the market, I think this is the best for the money."
3,Kodak Smart picture frame,"I had a heck of a time getting my flash card in the slot because I was trying to put it in like the picture in the instructions showed,after learning that the instruction were printed wrong I finally got it going.The picture frame is really easy to use,the on screen menu is very self explanatory,the only thing I was not to impressed with is the picture quality.I have a 3.3 megapexel camera and the screen will only display 640x480.It is a little grainy but everyone who see's the frame is really impressed."
5,The Omigosh Christmas Gift of the Year!,"Gave this frame to BOTH set of grandparents and just came back to order a third for me. The absolute easiest way to keep techies and non-techies alike updated with pictures. Easy to manage everyone's frames from the storybox network and soooo simple to share photos. If you have a digital camera and someone far away who would love to get ""live updates"" on a regular basis, I highly recommend this ""toy."" On a side note, we also gave siblings digital cameras, so everyone can stock the folks frame with pictures. Like I said, THE Christmas hit of the year!"
2,"Nice, but contract is a white elephant","This is the nicer of the frames I've looked at, but beware of the contract. Even if you think you can just use the compact flash card to display pix, you can't!! Frame will cease to operate unless you connect to their ""big-brother"" sharing network within every ten days!!Rip off!"
1,Kodak has discontinued online service.,"Storybox is now only 1/2 functional. You can no longer store pictures online for remote retrieval by the frame modem. Kodak has discontinued the internet photo storage service...""If you own a new KODAK Smart Picture Frame but have not yet registered with the STORYBOX Network, you may return your Frame to Kodak for a refund of your purchase price plus the shipping costs incurred to return the Frame to Kodak. Kodak regrets any inconvenience that this may cause""."
1,DONT DO IT,Unless you're ready to put up with a product that has no weekend assistance.I haven't gotten to Monday yet! not to mention the fact that YOU ARE REQUIRED TO REGISTER IT AND SUBSCRIBE TO THEIR SERVICE (albeit free for 6 months) before you can load your own photos from a flashcard. I was looking for a frame that didn't require any subscriptions and believed I found one from what was advertised here. WRONG! I have been trying for two days to get my unit to register itself with no success - happy mother's day mom - blame kodak.be prepared for frustation or look somewhere else.
3,Beautiful frame but Kodak has discontinued the online update,"The frame is beautiful and the display is one of the best I have seen. I've enjoyed the ability to update the photos remotely via the internet, but Kodak has discontinued this feature for new users. As I understand it, new frames can only be updated by compact flash card... this kills it for me. However, if you just want a great desktop frame with no internet subscription issues, it may be just what you need. A bit more expensive than other frames that I've seen, but the screen quality is much better too."
3,OK,"It was broke at the back. Unfortunally it was nothing about the Caldeens and their kingdom in iraq. Thanks Carolne Jarwa, a Swede married to a Iraqi man from Baghdad"
2,"""The Looting of the Iraq Museum, Bagdad -- a Disappointment","Instead of writing about the looting, what was lost, what has since been recovered and how, the various contributors seem to be very busy tell the reader how they had discovered the various items in the museum. If one were interested in discoveries, there are plenty of places to have read about them previously. The book seems to have been put together with minimum thought, poor photos of items that have already been published in much better form."
1,What went wrong?,"From the first time I listened to the cast album of Company, then on to A Chorus Line, I've always enjoyed Donna McKechnie. She always delivers a spectacular performance (especially on the great Follies album) and I was thrilled to hear that she'd be releasing a solo disc. I was especially looking forward to it because it would be on the Fynsworth Alley label, who'd released such great live recordings of Elegis for Angels, Punks, and Raging Queens, and their Jason Graae cd. However, when I was finally able to listen to Donna McKechnie's Inside the Music, I found her sounding tired and ragged. The whole thing seems to be mixed improperly... Too much of her talking is cut and the listener is left feeling out of the loop. I just can't figure out how a cd with such a great performer could be so unpleasent to listen to. If you want my advice, buy some cast albums featuring Ms. McKechnie and leave this one on the shelf."
2,Disappointed,"Don't get me wrong. I am a big Donna McKechnie fan. I have seen her in several productions starting with ""Promises,Promises"" leading up to her bravura performance in ""A Chorus Line"".I guess I thought this CD would be a recreation of those moments I saw. Unfortunately it is not. She acquits herself very well, but the material comes across very flat. There is nothing to excite the listener. I think one of the problems lies in the fact that McKechnie is an actor who needs a role. CD's like this are best in the hands of cabaret singers or entertainers.Performed before a small audience in a New York recording studio, it is autobiographical which is interesting. Christopher Durang wrote the script but it doesn't develop into anything.I was so hoping I would spend hours listening to it but unfortunately I won't."
2,Slanted View,"I'm probably not the best person to write a review of this book, as I did not get to finish the entire book (interlibrary loan). But quite frankly, I wasn't sure I wanted to finish it. Yes, some parts were poorly written, and it did have a lot of detail. However, those weren't the parts of the book that bothered me. I thought the author's viewpoint was slanted. From the very beginning the author wrote about Lorna Anderson as a woman without virtue, a scarlet woman, etc. whereas, Tom Bird was a paradigm of virtue. And if he wasn't exactly that, his notes, conversations, etc. to Lorna Anderson could be easily explained so the author was still able to show Tom Bird in the best light possible. Lorna Anderson may be everything the author says she is, and more. But the very thing the author complained about (the prejudice of the movie about Tom Bird) is the exact same thing he has done in his book."
1,bad beyond belief,"For the past 20 years I've read an average of 40 books per year. This book is without a doubt the most poorly written I've ever read. I only hung on through its repetitious hundreds of pages because I was interested in the murders that happened in a familiar locale. Early on, Racer thanks his (volunteer, father?) proofreader. He should have sprung for a pro. The punctuation in this book is not to be believed; a third-grader could do better. Beyond being poorly written, the book is totally one-sided and defies logic. I think this guy has his own publishing company, which may explain how this sorry work ever got into print."
4,love it,"Love this game, its a little out dated but really fun and challenging. I would reccommend it to anyone who likes games any where from trivia to tongue twisters."
5,Werner Aluminum ladder jacks,They are light weight. Easy to install and handle . Safer to handle than older style steel ladder jacks. Feel very stable when in use. I am very satisfied with this product.
5,"Amazingly, Shirley still astonishes and delivers.","This Birthday Concert Album reminds us that Miss Bassey is still number one in the entertainment business. Her powerful delivery is unforgettable as she takes us through songs such as Diamonds Are Forever, Something, Big Spender and a number of other gems. Yet with all her power, she sings songs like Yesterday When I Was Young with a tenderness that shows control and sensitive interpretation. Listen to This Is My Life and you would realise that this woman can make you feel joy, pain and every other emotion that is part of that song. Finally, she deserves to be recognised as one of the Best entertainers this century and her Grammy Award Nomination is a fitting accolade. Don't just take my word for it, purchase the album yourself, and you won't be disappointed."
5,A #1 fan from Brazil claps hands (and feet),"Many people say life begins at 40s - maybe voice also. Hearing this superb CD from one of my idols - Shirley Bassey - I notice her voice is stronger and much more sexy. Age means excellence for her. Shirley, marry me!"
2,Too Tame and too boring!,"This one is a fast read, but it's fast because it's boring! The author's issues with self-aggrandizement are really present in her writing...she is perfect and everyone else has the most horrific flaws! She never waivers to put someone down and yet,never makes any intention of trying to figure out why the person is acting/reacting in a certain way. I was bored with her tales of the VIP because none of it was really surprising to me. Actually, I came away wondering why she found it so amusing??"
1,Surface Skimming,"This book was lame. After a few chapters about the stereotypical dancer, the stereotypical strip club owner, the stereotypical strip club DJ, The stereotypical strip club bouncer, the author breaks the book into short (1-3 pages)chapters about clients. Each client has a boring story to accompany him (or her) None of them are particularly interesting, shocking, or entertaining. One guy likes feet, one guy likes lingerie. etc.If a skin-a-max movie could be a book, this would be it."
1,Don't Waste Your Money or Time,"This book is little more than contrived stereo-types that could easilly have been written by a twelve year old Nebraska farm boy who has never seen the inside of a strip club. A complete and utter waste of time, money and energy."
2,A very minor Dick book...near the bottom,"This is one of the last Dick novels to be reprinted, which should tell you something. It's one of Dick's weaker novels although probably not his worst (Vulcan's Hammer anyone?)Basically, save your money and time and read something else by Dick like Ubik, Man in the High Castle, etc..."
4,T-Jak TJ-104,Best Third Hand Device for Cabinet Installations. Worked as promised and will hold your wall cabinet indefinitely until secured to the wall.
1,Missing parts and broken,"The T-jak arrived just in time to hang my cabinets. When I opened the box that looked like it had been through WW2, the top plate was missing and the adjustment screw was smashed. Tool was useless."
3,T-Jak,This product works as promised. The obvious rip off is that it doesn't reach a full 8' so on must buy one or more extensions.
5,Cheap for what it does,"I prefer to install kitchen cabinets more or less by myself...it's patient, exacting work that doesn't lend itself to 'advice over the shoulder'. If I need help, it's intermittent 'help me hoist this'. The T-Jak (along with a wall cleat) makes patient (and safe) upper-cabinet alingment easy for me to do by myself...so I can take the time I need to take to get things perfect. Add a pair of Pony 8510 clamps, some trim-head and cabinet mounting screws, a couple of drill bits and good levels, and it will come out right."
4,Not the best mad libs.,"This would not be my best choice of mad libs simply because many of the stories are quite similar, about movie stars or something. The categories are't even that fun anyway. I hardly got a laugh out of mine or anyone else's words. Go buy some of its more popular titles."
4,Good value for the price,"We used the film with a cheap camera on our last trip and I truely didn't have my expections too high but all pictures came out nicely. Pictures we took in the evening did not come out as clear (greyish), possibly due to the quality of the camera. All in all - Strongly recommend."
2,Out of date,"I ordered this film because it was one of the few places I could find it. When I got it, all five packages were out of date. I've had one processed and the picture quality isn't very good--don't know if that was the processing or the film. I would like to know before I order what the expiration date is on the film."
2,Read the recent reviews!,"With this product, it does NOT come from the box shown. It comes in individual canisters in a small black box. There is no way to tell whether or not this film is expired!! I have yet to figure out whether or not my photos come out well due to the film age. Why use this photo if it's not how it will come? BE CARFUL!"
5,Known Guality,Kodak Gold film is and has been a great product for years. We have several good point and click film cameras and the battery life is great compared to digital cameras. We get great pictures with this film.
3,So Are They Legal For the Street?,"The product description at Amazon would lead one to believe that these would enhance the average driver's experience on regular streets and highways. However, a sticker on the packaging states: ""This product is intended for show and off road purposes only. Check your state and local laws regarding the use of this product."" I could find no DOT approval stamp on either the packaging or the product.I am leery of installing these at all, but if I do, it will be only as high beams. The price is great and the package is very secure. However, the warning should have been included in Amazon's product description."
4,Not too shabby.,"For the money, I wasn't expecting much.....Nice little surprise. These actually have great light output, a xenon-like color, and they've lasted a few months now without problems.I'd buy another pair without hesitation."
1,Not what I expected,I thought I was buying an ordinary head light replacement bulb.The item description did not say anything to the contrary.The package when it arrived had a small print marking saying not for ordinary street use. This implies that it must be super bright or somehow inappropriate. I should have returned the 2 packages (4 bulbs) but figured it was too late.
1,Idiot's Guide to Landscaping Illustrated,"This book is not at all what was expected for the price - all the pictures are black and white except for a very few color pages in the very center, which makes it almost impossible to help the reader identify plants, trees, shrubs, etc. All the black & white pictures blend so trying to distinguish what the publisher wanted the reader to focus on is extremely difficult. Might as well publish the book with only words and brief hand drawn illustrations. The reader still remains an ""idiot"" needing a guide to landscaping."
2,Needs color pictures,"The book itself has some decent info, but the B&W pictures kill the whole effort. Many of the pictures are just unclear, and the majority fail to convey useful visual information. I mean we are talking about plants here! If you can't see the colors, you're missing quite a lot! I am really surprised they would publish this without color pictures. Cost-cutting gone awry!"
1,I'm an Idiot for buying this book,Did not tell me what I needed to know to pick plants for my yard. I found most of what I needed in Sunset's Western Garden Book (I'm in the western US).

5,"Fun, frolic and soul touching.","A diverse mix of Russian, Israeli and Yiddish music which touches the spirit. Its fun to listen to; friends love it."
5,Just buy it!,"I bought this CD years ago, and it is still one of my favorites. A great mix of Jewish, Russian, Israeli, etc., both instrumental and some vocals. It has a ""down home"" feel as if you're listening in someone's big kitchen, yet the sound quality is fantastic. I have learned to play a few of these songs because they are so infectiously fun melodies."
1,Not for me!,"I bought ""A Jewish Odyssey"" and even though I didn't understand the different languages I really liked it. So looking for some more good sounds I read the reviews and bought this one. If you like a kind of Jewish opera, this is the one. It's a little to ""shrill"" for me. If someone wants the one I have, played once........"
3,"Good, but could be better","So a few words of caution. This is a very small unit and it had trouble with proper skids. Secondly, it's missing a pin (whole an pin) to keep an important peace in place. When this peace falls out, and it will, the unit cannot be raised. Our solution has been to tape it in place until we get it modified to work.The second, is only a comment on delivery, I don't normally state this in reviews but it will be helpful. We had to pay $35 extra to get a truck to deliver the item with a lift gate. This extra charge ultimately was never required as the company who delivered this said they are told on all shipments to deliver with a lift gate truck, so it would seem we paid extra to get something we would have got included. That doesn't effect my star rating of this product.I really do think this is just a 3 star unit, the part missing to keep it together and the difficulty on full pallets makes it a challenge. Otherwise it's been working without breaking for 3 months."
5,very good,i ordered this tail gate handle and its looking very good working fine no problems so far i like it
5,An inspired blend of performance and recording prowess,"This CD succeeds at the tricky combination of Glorious program material, inspired performance, and a flawless capture by the recording engineer."
4,Melancholy Good,"The Church always seemed to sound a bit ""Spooky"" and back in the 1980's that was not a bad thing in the music industry. Marty Willson-Piper was the guitarist that helped to texture the colors that shaped the sound of that band ever so greatly. But: ""Rhyme"" proves he had much more to say and it's a overlooked gem of a CD.This 1989 release features 12 finely crafted tunes that owe much to the man's musical roots. Marty, can be much more upbeat than The Church and he does know his way around a pop song quite well. A little bit jangly (The Byrds) as melancholy as Ray Davies or Brian Wilson. The great production of ""Rhyme"" sounds larger than the people involved. Listening to a tune such as: ""Say"" is quite moving.This is a timeless music and I feel lucky to have stumbled on to it.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
1,I returned it,"I've used Memory foam contour pillows for years with sucess and was wanting a firmer higher quality pillow. One week ago this pillow was listed as $160.00 marked down to $79.99. Thinking it was top of the line, I paid $79.99 and what arrived was this pillow. It was too soft and smelled like toxic waste. It's nothing you would want to lay your head on let alone smell all night. The pillow is wide but the same height as cheaper versions. The only thing that was good is Amazon's 100% guarantee, which is why I buy from Amazon."
3,The new Christy minstrels Green Green CD,I had this vinyl album since I was very young and wanted to get a good CD. But the songs are not all the same. They are redone with a later style and probably even later singers. I resent this.
5,fits Craftsman shop vac!,"Snip an 1/8 "" off the cardboard around the inlet and the bag will fit an ordinary Craftsman shop vac! The regular paper Craftsman shop vac bags are all but useless, they usually tear and let all the dust and dirt into the canister. These won't tear and do a great job filtering out all the dust."
2,"Nice flavor, but SO SWEET!","The root beer flavor was good, full and slightly spicy with a hint of sasparilla. And the cane sugar definitely tastes better than corn syrup. But the soda was so sweet I couldn't even finish the bottle. It has around 42g of sugar per 12oz, compared to Barq's 30g. Way too sweet!"
4,Does What it is Intended For,"It does what it was intended for. It works nicely with the Nikon camera and for a new battery, it can hold a charge that can take about 400 photos. That is about the same as what you get with a Nikon battery. Since this battery is new, the charge kept for 1 week without much loss. However, still do not know how many charge can it do before going bad. I had purchaed several other generic batteries and they did not last as long (number of charges) as the original Nikon battery."
2,Business Anal using Regression Case book,"This casebook was originally published about a decade ago and the data for the cases came in a format not easily used after downloading. The format may have been updated to a more modern one but I was not successful in opening the files for use in Excel or SPSS, which is what my students use."
4,fish lemon squeezer,"This product is well made, heavy and cute. It is well suited to use at home or parties, but is too bulky to carry with you in a pocket or purse. I like taking a small lemon squeezer with me to restaurants for ice tea or fish and this squeezer is too big for that."
5,"Jack P. Wise, Midwest Reveiws","The follwing is a reveiw by jack P. Wise, and can be found in whole at Denises Peices Reviews""...lovers of the world of fantasy will beyond a doubt find their hearts desire within the pages of 'War Of Storms Souls Of Chaos'."""
1,Feminal,Usless without a top. Cannot get a top. Must have been designed by a man and should be used by same.
1,Must have for camping,"Must have for camping.A No spill cap was included (not shown) was a nice plus and makes carry/clean up easy.Only downside is the contact edges where the plastic mold seams come together are very sharp and can cut you, if you press it against you, as the instructions state.Would have given 5 stars if the edges were smooth."
1,pretty but not very good,"When I bought this item I was impressed with all it could do, for the purchase price. When I received it I found the user info very unfriendly and the instructions for use sparse. Then it got worse it played only 1 out of 4 CD's without skipping. I returned the unit for a refund and bought a more expensive unit, different brand."
2,Too whiny for me,"I brought this book because I was curious about his experiences. Although the story was interesting, I felt he was too whiny. Did he ever think that African-American females were not interested in him because he has defective genetic material? I would not want the father of my child to be an albino because I would not want to give birth to an albino child or run the risk of having albino grandchildren or great-grand children. I would not recommend this book to any of my African-American female friends."
3,Mixed feelings,"This is a good noise cancelling headset, but the cord and stand are a little clumsy. The foam earpiece did not hold up and I needed the leatherette one after a short while. Started having problems after about a year and had to deep six it since it became too unreliable."
5,Laughed out loud!,"This book is great, quick read. I disagree that the Biblical references took away from this book -- if anything, I thought it drove home the book's message: Children learn from from what you do, not from what you say.Merurer tells a story about trying to sit down and tell the story of David & Goliath to his two young sons... it inevitably turns into a fiasco of bodily-function-humor and when the boys finally get the message, it turns out to be as a result of something they observed their Dad doing when he didn't realize they were paying attention.Half way through the book, I thought back and couldn't remember the author having come right out with a step-by-step... then I realized that he gets ""it"" across to the reader the same way he gets ""it"" across to his boys... with his actions."
2,Not what I was expecting,"One dad's adventures, but it seemed pretty tame (and not the best writing either). Also, it had a decidely Christain-bent which I didn't expect."
3,They left out the word Christain from the title,Not what I expected. The book was funny and an enjoyable read. But it should be called the Hair-Raising Joys of Raising Christain Boys. Not what I was looking for.
4,Quarter Exchanging!,Nick being his favorite quarterback (John Elway) for a night is very good! The whole story is creative! I ~WOULD~ recommend this book!
1,Don't buy this,"They ship a 3m particulate filter instead of an NBC filter, which is what you are probably expecting."
1,This was terrible,"I thought the movie was really cute and was anxious to read the book. Unfortunately, I was VERY disappointed. The book spent way too little time developing the romance between Nicole and Chase."
2,Faith's rock outing disappointing,"Through the 50s and 60s, Faith shaped instrumental music by providing standards and pop hits in an easy listening style with his signature strings and lush orchestrations. Unfortunately, Faith abandons his style for this rocky outing from the early '70s and it is a difficult listen. This disc is filled with bombastic arrangements filled with guitar licks and blaring brass. An easy listening version of the theme from 2001 would have been wonderful to listen to, but Faith interprets in a style that any rocker would find annoying. And why decide to reinterpret Superfly, Dueling Banjos. Oddly enough the best track is the theme from Ben. Go figure!"
3,Tee Shirt Size Problem,"It seems that I get different sizes even though the label says ""Large"". One of the four shirts I got is the exact right size, the other three do not fit the same around the neck so the neck of the shirt sags.And, I would not call the cloth ""Heavyweight"" compared to other brands I have that are thicker."
4,The authoritative source for any baseball card collector,"The Standard Catalog of Baseball Cards is absolutely indispensible for the Baseball Card dealer, and a near necessity for the advanced card dollector. Nearly every card ever produced up until the early 1999 issues is included, with both prices and complete checklists. There is also a sample photograph for each issue to help you identify those old cards you found in your attic.The only reason I don't give this issue 5 stars is becuase of organization. Rather than purely alphabetical, the book is devided into several sections (really old through 1980, 1980 - present, minor league, etc.). Some prior issue were simply alphabetical, which made it much easier to use. The information is still just as valuable, just a little harder to find."
4,Complete,"The Professional Chef, 8th Ed is a comprehensive compellation of basic cooking acumen. I would recommend this text book be in any serious chef's library."
5,so thorough,"Every sauce, every cut of meat, everything you can think of is in this book. I'll never need another cookbook!"
5,Excelente!,Todos que querem se dedicar a gastronomia deveriam ter este livro em casa. Altíssima qualidade.
4,Impressed,"I have a lot of ambiton in the culinary field, and will soon be attending culinary school. I was reffered to "" The Professional Chef, "" by a chef friend who said it was worth the investment. In my opinion it was well worth it. It has a wealth of knowledge, from the basics of food saftey, restaurant management, to world cusines, And hundreds of walk-throughs of classic recipes. The amount of information in this book is quite impressive, and I highly recomend to any aspiring chefs out there."
4,"very good book, just a little heavy :/","This has all the information to become a chef or just the at home cook. Tons of recipes, and info. Only complaint it is a little heavy, but just means you get your moneys worth. Great book."
4,How to make Eyes Glazed Over,"The Professional Chef covers the waterfront on topics of food ingredients, regional styles, and classic recipes.In many cases, this book offers too much background information at a not-quite-sophisticated level. It duplicates many details also found in other cookbooks. Of course, if I had just read this book first, some of those others might not have seemed as inspiring to me. But many of them offer details more interesting than those CIA has published here.The Professional Chef comes across more as a catalog and a manual than as a readable book. It includes numerous identification and how-to photos, and a modest number that show good presentation. For those who need a reference manual, this one book may replace a collection of others."
2,NEEDS A LOT OF SEASONING,I only buy Fantastic Foods Falafel Mix when I cannot find any Orgran Falafel mix.The Orgran falafel has much more flavor and isn't as heavy as the Fantastic Foods mix. I find that I have to really season the Fantastic Foods mix to make it taste acceptable.
4,Almost as good as homemade!,"If you don't have the time or energy to make falafel from scratch (nor the time to go eat falafel at a restaurant), then this mix is for you! I ate this for dinner last night, breakfast this morning, lunch this afternoon and I plan on making this for dinner tonight! Yummy!"
5,My favorite holiday album!,A great Christmas album. Beautiful jazz arrangements of classic Christmas music. This is at the top of my holiday playlist.
4,a very good live recording,"Jerry Jeff Walker does a very good job on this album. I know that many people steer clear of live ones, but this truly is good music. Pickup Truck Song, Woman in Texas, and Loving Makes a Living Worthwhile are all great cuts."
4,Nice Goods,"My shop is in my basement, so two things are of paramount importance: controlling the dust and minimizing the noise. This does both beautifully. As you will see, you do not have to make a lot of noise to move air. Also, your best opportunity to contol fine dust is at the source so being able to hook up a good vacuum to your sander, biscuit jointer, router, etc. is essential. For a vacuum that is at least an order of magnitude cheaper than the european ""dust extractors"" it works great. The only reason it does not get five stars (and it should) is that there is no on-board storage for the cord, hose, and other accessories."
1,an off peak disappointment,"Every band has works that are not stellar. This album by Negativland is one of them.Their Mertz stuff is just plain boring. To build an album on that concept is lame. Heck, Don Joyce does better on his lowest ""Over the Edge"" radio shows than he did on this album.It's only redeeming quality is the""OJ"" interview, it is funny hearing OJ talk about ""getting the blood pumping"" while hearing screams in the background!Rather than waste your money on this album, get Dispepsi. Or better yet get anything by Negativland thatincludes the nasal whining of my favorite Clorox Cowboy, The Weatherman!"
1,not so good,all though it says hypoallergenic it still made my eyelids red and itchy and it also affected my vision. I am using it on the rest of my face because I can't stand to waste the money and it works fine as a moisturizer anywhere but on my eyes.
2,Dissapointed,Either the bit doesn't work or a dremel just doesn't have the power to handle it. So I was disappointed when it didn't work as easily as I had hoped on both tile and backerboard.
4,Reveltech,This was not ordered to play with. This was ordered to be part of a collection of figures. It was packaged well and arrived promptly. The figure was exaxtly as described and is made of a rather sturdy material and it is poseable.
2,Don't buy this book (unless you want to learn yesteryear's technology),"This book looked really promising: a nice, quick guide to get you started ASAP on Hibernate. However, when I started to try to download Hibernate, I became aware that the book is based on Hibernate 2, while the current version is 3.3. Although I thought version 3.3 would be backwards compatible, it was not. Since I didn't want to learn a technology 4 years old, I tried to adapt the examples to version 3.3. In the end, I finished the book only to be aware of the legacy of Hibernate 2. Finally, the book always assumes that you are building a totally new database, which, in the enterprise environment, is rarely the case. Coverage of legacy databases is light or null. You might want to take a look to the book ""Java Persistence with Hibernate"", which is one of the most comprehensive books I've seen about dealing with legacy databases."
4,"Intermediate level, no nonsense notebook","This was my first look at a book from the ""Developer's Notebook"" series. Personally, I liked the format and the no-nonsense approach. It just gets you up and running with Hibernate, no more, no less. I don't think you need to be an ""expert"", but you should have at least a working understanding of Java, O/R Mapping, Ant, and SQL.I also liked the fact that the examples build upon each other as the chapters introduce new topics - no potential confusion with disparate examples for each topic. The Hibernate web site and documentation is already an excellent resource for learning all about Hibernate, and this book does not try to rewrite any of it. It does, however, defer to the online information quite a bit.I was looking for a quick, hands on book to get Hibernate up and running. This book worked out great."
2,error & outdated,"not only is this book pretty outdated as it only focuses on hibernate2 and not the newer release hibernate3 which is not backwards compatible... there was also a ""serious technical error"" early on in the book that set me back a while... google the corrections if you use this book.the writing style was decent... i wouldn't mind reading an newer updated copy"
3,Good book but needs an update,"For the versions of Hibernate and Hsqldb it was written for this is an excellent book to get you up and running, and a good introduction into the Hibernate platform.But Hibernate and Hsqldb both have moved on and many (most) of the examples no longer work without modification.Nothing that searching the web and Hibernate documentation can't find quickly though, leaving it still a viable introduction into the concepts and syntax.I personally like thin books and this one certainly doesn't try to spoonfeed you Java or anything, it assumes the reader is smart enough to figure things out for himself."
2,"Hibernate is a great tool, not too sure about the book!","Hibernate is a great Object / Relational Mapping Framework, however this book only touches limited number of things in Hibernate.I am specifically talking about, Object oriented design examples, non of the examples / samples discussed in the book have any object orientation like subclasses or Interfaces. This is a very huge promise of Hibernate, i.e. it preserves the Object oriented design of users domain objects.Would have been useful, if this book would discuss even a little about it.ThanksSyed Ghaznavi"
4,"Worth the money, but not an end-all book","This is the kind of book that will get you on your way to using Hibernate, but you will quickly outgrow it. It is laid out much better than the Hibernate Reference Documentation. After a couple of weeks, you will treat it mostly as a quick reference guide.Thankfully the book is priced correctly. Too often, a book with this amount of content would still be in the 35-45 price range with a bunch of fluff and filler added in to justify the price. They kept this one short and sweet and chock full of little examples and tip. They kept the appendix fluff to a minimum.If it was a little more detailed, I'd give it 5 stars. You'll still need the reference doc from Hibernate, but this will get you up and running."
2,Out of date for hibernate 3.0,"If you are interested in version 2.0 of hibernate, this book works well. If you, however, are interested in learning hibernate 3.0, you will struggle to get anything to work.Examples:1. code/ddl generation from mapping xml doesn't work without serious adjustment2. the session.find command no longer exists (page 48)3. session.delete(HQL) no longer exists (page 51)For someone who is trying to learn hibernate, this manual has caused more headaches than it has solved."
3,Good but a couple of things missing,"This book is very good to get you started with understanding and using Hibernate.I understand that this book is not meant to cover every aspect of Hibernate but not covering at all optimistic locking, component mapping and inheritance was a bit disapointing.If you are serious about using Hibernate on a project expect to have to read Hibernate in Action and the reference documentation.Overall, a good book to get you started and have a few examples that you can refer to when using Hibernate on a project."
3,a lot of hand-holding,"Some reviewers described this book as 'terse'. So I expected a 'just the core stuff' approach. I was very disappointed. A lot of time is spent on uninteresting stuff such as setting up trivial Ant scripts. The notes are not the essential insights and gotchas that you gain by experience but trivial and childish.Basically I found this book to do a lot of hand-holding. So much so that, while I'm very interested in Hibernate,I just discarded it after a few chapters. Money wasted.I agree with another reviewer that I will not buy a book from this series again."
3,Very preliminary will not help you archtect a solution,"This book gives you a fast paced introduction. However, if you are trying to figure out how Hibernate fits into your architecture e.g. how it relates to your business logic, how it can be configured in a DAO architecture, etc., etc. you need to look elsewhere.For a beginner it is definitely better then the documentation that comes with hibernate. Be prepared to buy a more advanced book if you want to do serious work with Hibernate."
3,Amusing,This was a good read with a few exciting twists. Would recommend to anyone who enjoys a good English romance.
2,Book was ok,"I paid for this, wish it had been free. Author has potential and I would be willing to read another of her works"
2,"Too Much, ""Woe is Me"", for My Liking","How can so many people be so smart and so so stupid. In many ways this novel ends up reading as a farce or a comedy of errors except without the comedy. The hero takes a decision that could ruin the lives of people for whom he cares and is responsible. The heroine runs from pillar to post which solves nothing except for creating more drama and possible secrets which can be exploited later in the novel. I am all for slipping into a fairy tale for a little relief from the days pressures but to try and bring that fairy tale into real life (even if the real life is in a novel)is beyond my capability of understanding.I would like to say that the writing itself was good. The story, while slightly convoluted was told well. I just did not like any of the characters that the story was happening to. I did not like the martyred decisions they kept making. I ended up thinking woe is me, why did I keep reading."
2,Ehhh,"My problem wasn't even the heroine but the so-called hero. He was a jerk from the start, and I couldn't stand him past the first few chapters. There was a lot of confusion in this story, as other reviewers stated, so don't even bother if you're looking for something amazing."
2,Very Disappointing,"It's a free Kindle download, let's see if it was worth it...It wasn't. The characters weren't strong, the story was all over the place and the ending was stupid."
2,Started out OK,"I'm not sure what happened. Both characters started out ok and then suddenly changed. The hero who supposedly is a nice guy and honorable turns out to be a liar who can't stand lies. And the heroine was strong but lost in fairytales, and suddenly becomes a pushover. Also, I found some parts so confusing with too many characters. And the numbers and some parts of the story don't add up. Hero's mother is 44 and was married at 15. Yet her son is 32. Doesn't add up. Also, the ending suspense bit was confusing and ended way too quickly with some hastily thrown in explanations. With some more work this could have been great."
4,Swept away,I didn't think I could be swept away by a book and yet I was. I gobbled up the words as quickly as it took to turn a page. The heroin and hero of the story were wonderful characters to following in their tale and perspective.
3,"Cute, but missing more","It's cute, but could be better. I downloaded it free, so I can't complain too much. However, I would have been upset if I had paid money for the book."
3,Good story,A nice read. Was slow to get into but had a compelling story line to keep you reading. Love the regency stories.
5,The author has excellent imagination.,"In order to write about fairy takes an author needs to a great imagination, Kelly McClymer has that ability to imagine a place and people and making it very real. Excellent book"
3,"Good until the end, then....",It was fairly good until the end when the characters no longer acted according to their established personalities just to make it have a happily ever after ending. The ending was cheesed.
2,boring,the book was pretty boring and stupid rather....i like to read historic romance but this was quite a disappointment...this book stretches the plot unnecessarily...don't understand why simon's mother is so provocative when she really knows the truth and does not clarify with him...and allows him to think whatever he wants to think....that is very very annoying....i would say a substance is missing in the story....
3,Bad Wolf Gaming,I did enjoy this story but found it difficult to take serious and I had several issues with the character development. It just wasn't believable at times. But for the price and the sake of a sweet story it was acceptable.
4,"Enjoyable, but...","The characters and the story were engaging and intriguing. One particular twist completely took me off guard and I usually see them coming a mile off.The one thing that annoyed me to no end was the heroine's ""cutesy"" way of likening everything around her to various fairy tales. Every time it made her seem like a juvenile, naive idiot, when the rest of the time she was rather level-headed and even cynical at times. It was jarring each time, but I enjoyed the rest of the aspects of the book."
2,A big disappointment,"Based on the other reviews, my expectations were high. I'm sorry to say I was very disappointed. The first part where Miranda is ""ruined"" is truly unbelievable. When Miranda and the Duke meet again five years later, there seems to be a lot of missing information. I thought there was a chapter missing. Then, the rest of the action is either predictable or far-fetched. I've read Romance for 30+ years, and I could barely finish this book. I'm sorry to say this, since I always am on the lookout for a new author and a new plot twist."
4,"Nice story, glad I bought it despite the negative reviews...","I wasn't sure about this story after reading some scathing reviews... First off, the Kindle edition does have some odd characters that pop up (I'm going to assume it was in the scanning... annoying but not uncommon in Kindle rescans)... Yes, the main character does relate life to fairy tales and happy endings, but it's not distracting... juvenile/naive on the part of the heroine, but that is what makes her innocent. There is mention of ""gaps""... well, we do jump ahead 5 years from the prologue to the main body, but the author does fill you in on the missing time. The characters were engaging, the story moved along... I liked the resolution at the end... All in all worth the 99 cent Kindle investment. Looking forward to the rest of the siblings stories..."
2,Life is not a fairytale,"The heroine has her head stuck in the land of fairies. It was an okay read, but not a ""I can't put this book down until I've finished it."" It was more like, I am stuck at the DMV waiting and there is nothing else to read kind of book."
5,Happy Ending Worthy,"This book is a good historical romance. It includes the bride's very close, loving family and the groom's distant, estranged family full of destructive secrets. The main characters, Miranda and Simon, are interesting and complex characters and opposite in many ways. They are a long time coming to their relationship because of Simon's family issues, and once they do marry, things don't seem to look up. Miranda has always been a fan of fairy tales and what they can teach, but she just can't see how to find a happy ending for herself and her broken husband, Simon.The supporting cast of characters are interesting and add to the story. The plot has twists and turns to keep readers on their toes, and the writing is well done. I enjoyed this story and look forward to reading more by this author.Heat factor moderate."
3,Decent story,"Kind of a hokey ending, but overall a good read. Wish the ending was a bit stronger. I would recommend this author."
3,Bland,This is a romance story with a strong female who doesn't do anything. A weak man who lets morals outshine love and it provides the bland story line. Even a bad guy who doesn't cause the regular strife that comes with romantic stories. I always wanted it to get better as the story had the opportunity for it to but unfortunately it didn't.
1,Not a very easy book to follow,"This book was about the usual Duke who marries a woman he desires, but can not have. It tends to jump years at a time. I found myself going back to read what previously happened five years ago, which was only the last paragraph before. It does not explain how several things happened or why they happened.Just that they need to be fixed now. To me the book was confusing and the consistancy was not there. I lost interest and did not finish the book."
2,Fantastic,"It is a beautifully written story full of vibrancy, passion,healing and most important of all Love!! Thank you to the authors:)"
4,Wonderful story!,I really enjoyed this story especially the ending! A good read and decently written. I am interested in readying more by this author.
3,a good summer read,"I found this an enjoyable read. The female lead is not true to period, but the author actually deals with this issue and makes work. It was bit predictable, but still had twists that weren't entirely foreseen. Mostly true to period. I don't regret the afternoon I spent reading this book. Always a plus the free category."
2,"IT'S A PAMPHLET, NOT A BOOK !!","I was expecting this to be a paperback book, but I was surprised when I received a pamphlet. A ($) pamphlet (including S/H). Albeit, it is a very nice pamphlet, complete with descriptions and pictures AND a map of the California coastline pinpointing the lighthouses. For preplanning your trip exploring lighthouses this would be good, but not for use in the car enroute to the lighthouses. It's huge!"
2,"2x Porter-Cable 43221-10 1/8-Inch Spiral Up, Non-Piloted, Cutout Bit, HSS, 1/8-Inch Shank (10-Pack)","Got this through amazon from Tool King. They sent me 2 bits not 2 ""10 packs"". Amazon states 84% off and they still sell for 1.99?! I found that very misleading and outright ridiculous how much the price was inflated just to advertise such a huge discount. Tool King did refund me my money though.Porter-Cable 43221-10 1/8-Inch Spiral Up, Non-Piloted, Cutout Bit, HSS, 1/8-Inch Shank (10-Pack)"
3,Cannonball fans item,"This one is strictly for those who love the man and his playing. Remastering is a bit poor , percussion comes out fine but horns sound at times muffled. Here is a different way of alto playing, soul jazz with a bit of free jazz , not like his late 50's output. Interesting though are the interpretations of Black Orpheus and Experience in E, the 'work song' version is not one of his greatest - brother Nat sounds more in form here as throughout the whole album - , the rest of it just doesnt seem to have the kick. If you check the re-release of the 'Them Dirty Blues' cd, you'll be more than delighted. I'll keep this one cause I'm a dedicated fan."
1,Well...at least the CD case is cool looking.,"I don't know Kid606, but I can only imagine that this is what happens when, probably under the influence of drugs, someone with a bunch expensive analog toys pays a recording label to release his monotonous, rhythmless noise.Some of the tracks start out with promise for the first few seconds, but then the rest of the song is just that few seconds over and over for 8 minutes or so.Unless you like collecting the slightly interesting CD cases of horrible albums by pretentious pseudo-musicians, your money would be better spent buying a bottle of whiskey for a bum on the street corner. At least then SOMEBODY would be enjoying something for your money."
1,This book has 300 pages of absolutely nothing.,"I have read more finance books then I can even remember. While none give you everything you want; most at least give you some good basics or even decent beginner strategies. This book is the rare exception to provide neither. I would go into more detail but just like the book I am frankly just unable to. There just really isnt anything to this book but the most basic of definitions and ideas (buy low sell high). This book provides no real strategies. I mean what kind of investing book outside of this one would take a whole chapter to talk about the components of a computer? (monitor, mouse, RAM)?"
3,GREAT COVER,GREAT COVER I THINK WE CAN DO BETTER. I LOVE CNBC MYSELF.I SEEN MORE BOOKS WITH MORE DETAIL INFORMATION. AS I SAID GREAT COVER.
3,Is this really the top of the line?,"For best results ignore the included directions for use that come with this tape applicator, and thread the tape though the banjo without using their ""tape guides"" this will result in much easier and more uniform application of joint compound"
5,Exactly what I expected,I've had one of these before and they perform exactly how I would want them to. I don't do enough taping to make it worth buying a bozooka so this banjo works great for me.
3,banjo,"I am kinda upset with the tape guides that come built into the banjo. I find them to be point less. I think they make it harder to pull the tape out when loaded with mud, and they also don't allow all the mud from being used. When you think your banjo is empty there some mud that wasn't used because the tape guides won't allow the tape to reach the mud. Im probably gonna cut them out with my saw. Another flaw I found is when you wipe your knife on the edge of the banjo to load it. There is a lip instead of a straight edge. This is bad because mud builds there and when you close the lid mud splats out. You constantly have to wipe the edge because you dont want chunks to dry up and fall in your wet mud. These are design flaws I caught before. I even used it. Im surprise the manufacture didn't. I wish I would of just bought the one my buddy did."
4,good board,"I have no complaint about the board. I bought two, (green and red) so that I can use one for meat and other for non-meat. Works out pretty well."
5,Great,The cd was in excellent condition. It was just as described in the listing. Thank you for your honesty!
3,Product is not the one in the picture,"The product is not the one in the picture, the candles I received are smaller.Ignoring this issue, the candles are good, they have a nice size, and are good as ornament."
4,International flavor.,"""Postcards"" has an interesting sampling of music from around the world. The music is sung beautifully by the chorale. I must admit that sometimes I like music that's more familiar to me but this does grow on you. You can't go wrong with the Turtle Creek chorale!"
1,Bad bad bad,"This is the worst CD associated with Guided by Voices. I thought it was going to sound like GBV but instead it soulds like bad 80's hair metal. If I wanted hair metal I would go buy something by Poison or Cinderella. One of the songs tries so hard to sound like Van Halen that it's just embarassing. ""Capricorn's Paycheck"" sounds like the worst 80's metal I have ever heard. If you liked Def Leppard ""Pyromania"", WASP, Michael Schenker Group, or Ratt, then buy this. It's right up your alley."
2,Dissapointed,"I was dissapointed with the patterns, they were all very interesting and the pictures were beautiful but the yarn use for the patterns was ridiculously expensive. I made a pillow and it ended up being $65. The patterns also had several misakes in them, I made the slippers and the pattern was incorrect, I brought the book into my yarn shop and they said they do NOT recommend the book to newer knitters due to the multiple pattern errors. Great pictures and good for ideas but not great for a newer knitter."
3,Not worth the money,"I was excited to order this book. I had heard good things about it. However, I was dissapointed when I received it. It has very few and very basic patterns. And, the photographs are hard to see because they are either cut off or do not show the item well enough for one to appreciate the item. Out of the whole book, only one item interested me and it was a shawl. I would not reccomend you buy this book. THere are lots better out there."
5,Enjoyable experience for historical NYC and subway fans,"I really am enjoying this book and recommend you who are reading this buy it immediately and ask your library to buy it. if you are a train, subway or historical NYC buff, you will be amazed at the number of great photographs and details. Mr. Fischler, when you get a chance to edit this, please add on every chapter heading, the borough. No one starts with page one. We skip around first and we don't have your encyclopedic knowledge of locations. Also, map a little legend supered on each photo, an indicator symbol of the approximate NESW direction, the year if you know it, and the borough. It would make the experience of reading the book even more enjoyable, if that is possible! Thank you for what is obviously a great gift to us."
1,wrong size,"they said it fit my car and it was 2"" to long. was not able to return it because I never got a chance to install it till the weekend. don't buy anything off this site if you can't use it the day it arrives."
5,Good lens,"Lens arrived before promised -- same day as my camera, a Sony Alpha A65 (also reviewed.) Used both at a local state park to get some nice shots with contrasting colors and blending colors. Spring is not quite here yet. Pictures taken were great. Only issue I had was trying the auto focus on a close up of some of the last berries on a branch. I switched to manual focus and got a good photo, with the background appropriately blurred for a macro close up. I also caught geese flying off the marsh, as well as great contrast with greening plants under water.Price was right and lens worked great!"
4,Great Lens!,"I just received my new Tamron lens today and I already love it. Fit my sony a55 perfectly and is very similar to my sony lenses. It will be nice for most trips to have one lens that does it all instead of carrying around my 18-55mm lens and my 75-300mm lens and having to change between the two constantly.I'm not a professional photographer, just someone who loves to shoot a tremendous amount of photos of many different subjects. I'm really pleased thus far with the performance of this lens.I took it to a wildlife sanctuary today and got some great shots. It focused quickly and well and the photos came out wonderfully!Thanks Tamron for making such an affordable lens that works well!"
2,Poor costumer service,Overall lens is ok.Some pictures showing that lens is Made in Japan.Actualy is Made in China.Company never return promised rebate.
5,"Easy, Delicious and Stressless",I love Ina's recipes. They are guaranteed crowd pleasers and are simple to make. I also look to her books when I want to make something great without stress! I highly recommend this.
1,Were recipes even tested before publication?,"I normally love BC cookbooks and own most of them. When I received this one as a gift, I was excited to try out the Asian salmon recipe. I made it for a group we have over for dinner. Now, I enjoy salty food, but this was almost inedible. The recipe called for a cup of soy sauce for the marinade, to be poured over the salmon, with a breadcrumb mixture on the top (also covered with the marinade). Everyone at the table had to scrape the topping off just to be able to eat the salmon. It was that salty. I wonder how testers ever could have approved such a recipe? Why didn't they call for low-sodium soy, or cut the amount of soy to a quarter cup? I was very disappointed. I think maybe BC has used all her good recipes, but her publishers were pushing another cookbook, and the rest of us are suffering the consequences."
4,Couldn't Be Happier,I ordered this book for my daughter -- it arrived in a a few days time in perfect condition. I couldn't be happier with the experience.
2,Another Disappointment after Barefoot in Paris,"Ina Garten has lost sight. This is an other book fron Garten lacking in creativity and intelligence. She only wants to talk about people she knows or places she has been. Vapid.This book was a gift, otherwise I would have returned it with Barefoot in Paris. Too bad, I had such high hopes for her early on. Maybe the next will be a turn around."
5,Barefoot Contessa at Home,This book is so fun to read and hard to choose which recipe to make first! The Mexican Chicken Soup is worth the price of the book!
5,Wonderful Tortilla Lasagna recipe in this book!!! WOW,"Barefoot Contessa (Ina Garten) is a wonderful chef, great recipesthat have been proven to be great; and this book has a recipe fortortilla lasagna you have to have.My wife and I recommend thisbook which we feel is a classic. A must have. Ina is a brilliantnice lady with a heart full of love for people and food - a greatmatch in this book."
3,Not as Foolproof as her previous offerings,"I am a HUGE fan of Ina Garten's previous cookbooks,a nd eagerly gobbled this one up. But, some of the receipes in this book did not pan out too well for me. First, the seafood paella was not easy, and it did not turn out very tasty. I am not sure what happened, as I am a voracious home cook, and have presented many of Ina's previously pulished receipes, but this did not turnout too well. That being said, her couscous was delicious, as was her lamb kebabs. The hamburgers were average, although that pat of butter and egg yolk made the patties flavorful and rich."
4,Ina hits another home run,"Ina once again provides simple to follow, reliable recipes made with easy to find ingredients. I know that if I have a dinner party I can follow her recipes and be confident in the outcome. Although there is some redundancy in her books... I have them all... they are definately my ""go to"" cookbooks."
3,Not her best.,"I love Ina's cookbooks and have two others. However, in looking through this one so far, these recipes seem heavy, in my opinion, for everyday cooking. Since I bought this book with the understanding that it was to be used for more casual, everyday fare, I'm still deciding whether to keep it. (I know Ina uses butter and fat in all of her cookbooks, but the amounts feel excessive in this one considering the point of the book.) I also agree with other reviewers regarding the large number of salad and sandwich recipes in the book.I'm actually writing this review because a reviewer below raves about a chicken pot pie recipe in this book. My book doesn't have a chicken pot pie recipe. And yes, I'm talking about the newly released Barefoot Contessa at Home. Either my book has pages missing, or is the reviewer below not being completely honest about which recipes s/he has actually tried from this book? (Editing to say that the pot pie recipe is not in this book--found it on the web though.)"
5,A sumptuous feast for the eyes & tastebuds!,"I have to admit that I have only recently begun watching Ina Garten on the Food Network, and I love her cooking show ""The Barefoot Contessa"". So, when I got this cookbook, I already knew that Ina's brand of cooking doesn't really fall into the healthy category as she uses a liberal amount of butter and salt, but as my grandma used to say, ""That's what makes food taste so good!""...I do however tweak some of the recipes to make it healthier, and they are fine. I love the gorgeous pictures for the recipes, and the easy to prepare instructions...plus she has many interesting ideas for those of us who need to prepare a meal in a hurry, wish to entertain without the toil and sweat [dishes that can be prepared ahead of time], and the mouth-watering desserts are something else altogether! All in all, an excellent cookbook, with reliable recipes by a master chef!"
2,Not so wonderful,I was disappointed in this book. Most of the recipes are standards that we all have in our heads.
2,"Yawn! Same-old, same-old...","Being a big B.C. fan, I could hardly wait to get my hands on her latest. Unfortunately, there is nothing new, and nothing exciting in this cookbook. As I flipped through the cookbook, there was nothing that jumped out at me. I was completely underwhelmed. To end on a positive, it is a pretty book!"
5,Good book for keen cook,"It is good to find that home cooking can be fun and delectable without recourse to hard to find ingredients. I have tried and enjoyed Chicken Piccata,Fresh Pea Soup and Herb Roasted Onions. I plan on trying the cakes,muffins etc. when Winter comes. I envy her her East Hampton lifestyle! One problem is the lack of definition of some measurments ie stick of butter. I look forward to using this book again and again"
2,Beautiful book---not many new cooking ideas.,"I only found 1 recipe in the whole book that I would like to try....love the pictures, but was hoping for several new recipe ideas."
3,Barefoot Contessa at Home: Everyday Recipes,Was disappointed on the content of the book and expected more recipes than what I had already seen before.
5,Cooking made easy,All of the Barefoot Contessa cook books are easy to read and follow. I've tried several of the recipes and haven't found one that I haven't loved. Recommend the Barefoot Contessa cook books to everyone.The books purchased on Amazon.com are always competively priced. The whole process is simple and efficient. Thanks for making something in my life so easy.
3,"Really like Ina, but don't think this is her best cookbook","If you are impressed with glossy beautiful photos and a wonderful layout from a top cookbook diva, this may be for you. However, I prefer Ina's previous cookbooks over this one. I did not find most of the recipes (BLT sandwich with avocado; chicken salad sandwich; tomato, mozzarella & pesto panini; peanut butter and jelly bars; caramel pecan sundaes; etc.) to be as inspiring as one would expect from this latest book.Don't get me wrong, I really do enjoy Ina's previous cookbooks, her TV show (even her voice and demeaner can relax the most frustrated cook), her wonderful recipes and especially the ease in which she walks you through them. I just don't feel this is her best recipe collection.Hopefully, Ina's next cookbook will have a few more inspiring and challenging recipes.Overall, 5 stars for beauty; 5 stars for ease of use; but sadly only 3 stars for the recipes."
3,A little disappointed,"I pre-ordered this book sight unseen because I always enjoy Ina Garten's books, recipes and tv show. I am disappointed by the amount of sandwiches & salads. I found the unusal focus on summertime meals and cooking to be misplaced in a cookbook being issued in October. Some of the recipes like Summer Garden Pasta look delicious, but they really cannot be prepared until next summer. I did enjoy the notes scattered throughout the book."
3,Ina Garten's well composed recipes,"Ina Garten is a master writer of recipes. They are all clear and easy to follow. The book is not as useful for me as I had hoped because I have some dietary needs, trying to stay low-glycemic. This book is not conducive to my kind of diet, but there are a few recipes I can use."
5,Works after a while - Be patient!,"It actually works! Wowbut takes time and patience!When I started I was very skeptical about this product, I even when to see a doctor to check on my progress.At the end I was able to remove the corn easily, it was a bit painful, but nothing special."
5,Amazing product,"I've had a callus for over a year and haven't bothered to remove it. It was pretty big - almost an inch in diameter. After 2 days of use, I noticed that parts of the callus could simply be painlessly pulled off. After a week and a half, most of the callus was already gone. I highly recommend this item, and 9.8 mL is plenty to remove 2-3 calluses."
1,Horrible,"I tried this product over a year ago and it scars the healthy skin around the corn and leaves a white spot in the middle of the toe from where the corn has been removed. If you are a person with fair to caramel skin tone DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT. This product will leave dark scars on your skin that will be there for years. I've been using a bleaching cream for these dark scars and it's been working slowly. I really wish someone had warned me of this product. Stay away from it please!!! If only I can rate this product on a level of zero ""0"" because it gets no kind words from me."
1,Nope!,"I have very thick calluses on the balls of my feet and was very excited to try this product but was sorely disappointed. Did everything the directions said and more, yet my thick patches of skin are still with me. Wish there was a cost-effective solution out there that actually worked!"
1,worst experience,"i got my container and all the liquid was outside of the bottle. i had to throw it away, was a waste of $7."
5,Great book for Tortoise Owners Like Myself!,"I recommend this book to anyone who has a turtle or tortoise - it is a handy dandy reference book with lots of insighful information. I have an African desert tortoise that was given to me. I knew nothing about its care - did not even udnerstand what it would eat - this book was helpful.Easy to read, easy to undertsand. Filled with lots of good common sense stuff that makes it easier to understand your pet."
4,A Good Overview of Biology and Evolution of Turtles,"This book covers a wide range of turtle biology, beginning with paleontology and ending with modern conservation issues. The book has many beautiful pictures illustrative of the points that Orenstein makes. I especially enjoyed Oreinstein's analysis of turtle features, such as the lack of fenestrae, and turtle evolution. The recent discovery of odontochelys probably makes some of the paleontology sections outdated, but the assessment of model turtle features is still very useful.I should warn that this book reads more like a biology textbook rather than a travelogue about turtles. There are no cute turtle stories. However, this book will allow turtle-lovers to appreciate just how unique turtle biology truly is.At times, Orenstein writing is a bit awkward, with very long sentences and some double negatives. However, it doesn't distract too much from the book."
3,Needs subtitles,"This Columbia movie looks on DVD pretty good - Screen format may be 1.85:1Sadly there no subtitles available (neither english nor other language).Starring: Lana Turner (her costumes cost in this movie over 1 Million Dollar!!!), Cliff Robertson, Ruth Roman, Hugh O'Brian, Virginia Grey and Stefanie Powers (famous from TV's ""Hart to Hart"" as Jennifer Hart). A supporting role has broadway actor and singer Ron Husmann (the blond guy and friend of Hank, played by Hugh O'Brian).Fazit: a nice crime / drama movie, filmed on location in Acapulco, Guerrero, Mexico."
5,Love Has Many Faces,"Really enjoyed this film. Saw it in theather went first released and it was great to find it again years later. I have looked for it for years. The acting was great, especially liked Hugh O'Brian in his role."
5,WOW HOW BEAUITFUL WAS LANA,I HAVE ALWAYS WANTED THIS MOVIE ARRIVED FOR ME ALL THE WAY TO AUSTRALIA LANA WAS STUNNING BOY COULD SHE WEAR CLOTHES NO JEANS AND T SHIRT FOR THIS STUNNING LADY. GREAT PRINT LOVED IT AT LAST I HAVE IT IN MY COLLECTION IN AUSTRALIA MANY THANKS FROM THE LAND OF OZLIZA DELLA REESE
5,Real life experience testimonial,"I recently used the T-Jak for upscale remodeling work. It is fantastic for having on location. Header and girder adjustment, ceiling joist positioning, pocket door installation, it is all around very useful. Where an adjustable vertical support can benefit the task, the T-Jak is the ticket!"
1,Don't Buy It,"This is just a peice of threaded pipe with a coupler painted orange. Go to your local hardware store and buy a peice of pipe and a can of orange spray paint, then send me the difference. You're welcome."
5,Great grapefruit knife,"I have been shopping a lot on specialty tools and I really like the quality and the price of this knife. It cut perfectly, it is light, it looks made of good quality and the price is right!"
3,Caused too many cuts,"This knife was very effective for grapefruit, but I had to get rid of it because it was was rather dangerous to have around. I kept getting cut with the knife when reaching into the draw for it or other things. Also, it was a pain to clean the side with two blades because grapefruit got stuck between them. I can just use a paring knife to cut between the membranes anyway. What's really needed is the sharp curvy part, with a comfortable handle."
5,Works perfect for my 2007 Pontiac Vibe,I bought these as some plastic shroud underneath the car was falling down. The previous plastic rivets fell out. These went right in by just the push of my thumb and fit perfect! Couldn't be happier! Hopefully they hold up better than my last ones. (Has been a few months without incident so far)
4,""" It's Always Hot At The Equator ""","I first heard Van Manakas's guitar playing on the Tunnels disk called ""Percy Jones With Tunnels"". I didn't know what to think of him at first until I purchased a copy of ""Letters From The Equator"". A playing style all his own and an excellent style as well. Musically this recording is great! Accompanied by Jim Brock on percussion and a Professor Johnson recording, this disk is a winner! If you like guitar music that isn't just technical ability and you liked Van's work with Tunnels than I strongly recommend this disk to you."
2,After The Professor and the Madman I expected better,"Since I had absolutely loved a previous book by Winchester I really expected this to be a continuous page turner, something that immersed me in a place, a time, introduced interesting characters forgotten in history or something...Instead this book felt padded. Massively so, with chapters devoted to all kinds of minutia that really wasn't related to the incidents of that day or its aftermath. I would ask the people writing the positive reviews of this book if they felt that given a ruthless editor who made Winchester remove a full 1/3rd of all the pages, if they don't think it would have made a much more interesting book."
1,Too verbose; his editor must have been on vacation,"Never use one word when ten will do. Very pedagogical. A truly fascinating topic that could have been much better addressed with a tightly edited work. The New Yorker style insights into the telegraph, Dutch colonialization, etc. are interesting, but too verbose."
2,Booorinnnggg,"Q: How do you make the world's biggest explosion boring? A: By adding hundreds of pages of tangential material about everything other than the volcano blowing up, and then giving short shrift the details on the actual boom. I was expecting something more exciting. It's too long on history and too short on science."
1,It's sopor- iffic!,"I read every night before I go to bed. I usually like to read for 25 or 30 minutes; with Krakatoa, I have been out in three. I have stuck with it because my husband really liked it, but this is the dullest representation of an exciting event that I have ever read. I'm almost finished, and I won't be picking up any more Winchester soon. By the way, and I hope I'm not being patronizing, but soporific means sleep-inducing. It's kind of a pun."
2,Half The Length Would Have Been Better,"I just finished this tome. It was a slog to get through. Around page 200 it got interesting and was an easy read. But much of the book is about the history leading up to the event, along with a good dose of plate tectonics.Perhaps in the hand of another author this supporting material would have been acceptable, but as it was, this book felt more like a text book than a book to be read for pleasure. If the book had been pared to less than 200 pages it would have easily received four stars from me."
4,Boom! Krakatau...,"Simon Winchester spins an excellent story of history, people and siesmic events colliding dramatically in an unstoppable fashion. If you are a student of the earth and well chosen prose, this book is a joy to ""live"" through. A fitting tribute to those who perished chasing spices, explosions and tsunamis.I can't wait for the movie!"
2,The eruption doesn't happen until 2/3 of the way through the book,"I have to say the background information about telegraph cables, plate tectonics, and other non eruption related topics were interesting and informative. But they went on way too long. The actual eruption isn't discussed until 2/3 of the way through the book. I wanted to read about the most intense volcanic eruption in history not ice cores in Greenland or the function of barometers."
4,A splendid work of popular history and science,"This is a highly enjoyable work dealing with the explosion of the 1883 explosion of the volcano of Krakotoa, possibly the most celebrated irruption in recorded history. In terms of the size of the explosion, the impact on world weather patterns (and also producing some of the most glorious sunsets in history), and affect on our collective memory, Krakatoa pretty much stands alone. Winchester in this book blends geology, anthropology, religion, colonial and political history, to produce a hybrid work of enormous entertainment and educational value. Some scientists here have complained and I cannot address their complaints. But I can say that there is more to the entire affair than the most rigid geological concerns.But if you are not a professional geologist, I definitely recommend this. I loved that the book brought so many disparate bits of information and history together. It makes for an informative and fun read."
3,great description of the eruption,"Winchester does a wonderful job describing the eruption of Krakatoa and the subsequent effects it had on the world. Using first hand accounts, he reconstructs the day of the eruption. In addition, Winchester describes the area as it is today, awaiting the next eruption."
4,"Like All good Non Fiction, lots of interesting asides","I have read other reviews where the reviewer laments Mr. Winchester's ramblings in this book. In my opinion, the power of non-fiction is the sheer amount of interesting tidbits that get passed to the reader.For example, in a few sections of this book, you hear about how Darwin didn't coin the term ""survival of the fittest"", he borrowed it. You learn the origins of the Reuters news service. You learn about Islamist nationalism. And of course, you learn about volcanoes, plate tectonics, and all manner of geology, biology, and geophysics. (did you know DesCartes had it all figured out before anyone else? I didn't!)It's these diversions that make a non-fiction book fun to me.It is also obvious through this book that geology is Mr. Winchester's first love, and he treats her with a velvet touch. I always found this stuff boring, but he treats it with reverence.I enjoyed this book, and would recommend it.(*)>"
4,Delightful ramble to a big bang,"This is not the direct route to Krakatoa. If you are ready for a delightful historical and scientific ramble with plenty of quirky side trips (including parentheticals*)that eventually bring you to ""The Day the World Exploded"" then you will love this book. From why a lace furniture shroud is called an ""antimacassar"" to the German roots of Tsingtao beer. By the time the tsunami arrives you may have forgotten that this was why you picked up the book in the first place. But in this case it is very much about the voyage not the destination.* And plenty of footnotes."
5,Great Story!!,"This book explores, in excellent detail and story telling, one of the great geological events in recent history. It is a stark reminder of what will happen when the Yellowstone Caldera turns itself into a super volcano."
4,an excellent geological as well as historical & sociological study,"This excellent geological, as well as historical & socialogical study is a must-read in order to grasp the full extent of interaction between human society and Nature. It's also a heads-up regarding the realities of life for anyone living along an active tectonic border."
5,"Krakatoa: The Day the World Exploded: August 27, 1883",The book is more informative than the shows that I have seen on TV. There is a lot that has been explained. Thank you.Karen Kay Ullom
2,Krakatoa,"This book is quite slow which lost me. I feel it focused far too much on island horticulture and populace. I purchased the book specifically for the eruption and post-eruption affects, and because I didn't receive that information early enough in the book, I chose to not finish it."
5,"Goes all over the place, but it's lots of fun","I first heard of this book because my ex-husband was reading it, and it sounded interesting. (He's not totally useless--haha!) Anyway, the book did not disappoint. Winchester goes in all kinds of directions with amazing little facts that nonetheless made a cohesive whole. I learned a lot about geology (including re-learning things I picked up in a college geology course) and it all made sense to this non-scientific person! (I had previously read ""The Professor and the Madman,"" and didn't realize Winchester was a geologist.) This is a good book for teens and adults with any interest in history and science. There's plenty of both in here to go around."
3,A bit disappointing,"I was really excited by this book when I first saw it couldn't wait to read it. The book starts off great and was quite fascinating. By the half-way point of the book it was really starting to get boring and I continually lost the excitement I had. By the end, I gave up and didn't even read the last chapter. It's not a bad book by any means. The book was quite fascinating, but became repetitive enough that by the end of the book, I felt I was reading a re-hash of earlier chapters. In fact, the actual eruption isn't talked about until nearly three-quarters of the way into the book, by which time I already knew so much about it that it wasn't exciting and had little impact. If you're fascinated by events such as Krakatoa and like to learn, I'd recommend the book, but if you're just looking for a quick and exciting adventure book, give it a miss."
3,Great research and topic - annoyingly written,"I started reading this book because of the author and the subject. The subject is intriguing and Winchester adds lots on interesting connections, like the Wallace Line and the Muslin fundamentalists. What he doesn't do is write clearly or engagingly. I am on my third try - I gave up in boredom twice before. You cannot keep track of what and where everything is. He should have included a map of the place somewhere like the inside back cover - or better yet a fold out. I keep asking myself - where is that? He talks about ships sailing without giving their course. I have gone back several times to determine is the ship sailing east to west or vice versa through the Sundra Strait. I printed a current day map from the internet to keep my bearings, although it has none of the names from the 1880's.I will punish myself and finish this time. This feels like a badly done research paper for some moldly doctorate."
2,"Tedious, I gave up","I like nonfiction occasionally, and the subject of this one seemed fascinating so I was eager to dig into it. But it was disappointing to find that I just could not stand the writing style of this guy. It wasn't long before I gave up. I may give Winchester another chance since The Professor & the Madman seems interesting."
4,"Good book, but bad timing","This was a very entertaining read, with the author doing a great job in writing about an area in history that hasn't gotten a lot of attention, the colonial South Pacific. To set the scene properly, he needs to jump around frequently, and he still manages to keep the book moving quickly enough that it never gets bogged down.However, as the other reviewers stated, Krakatoa was most significant in terms of casualties due to its immense tsunamis, that were some of the largest in recorded history. Until, of course, the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami that killed over 200,000 people. After that disaster, much of the wind is stolen from the later chapter's sails, and comparisons between Krakatoa and the later tsunami are inevitable. Which is unfortunate, because they shouldn't take away from an otherwise commendable book."
3,Felt Padded,"The information in this book was fascinating -- for example, how much dirt/debris/particle-matter entered the atmosphere and affected the world. However, at all times while reading it, I felt that the book was padded: extra, not necessarily interesting, information thrown in to make this come out to book-size. I felt this would have been stronger and more memorable as a much shorter book."
5,A fabulous book by a great writer,"Simon Winchester is a fabulous writer and this new book is fully worthy of him. He is both accurate and incredibly easy to read all at the same time - the perfect combination for those of us who want a serious book that is also fun to read. Buy it and enjoy! Christopher Catherwood, author of CHRISTIANS, MUSLIMS AND ISLAMIC RAGE (Zondervan, 2003)"
5,This is so much better than one would expect...,"I can't begin to describe the excitement that builds as one reads this fine piece of historical and political and utterly fantastic story charting the events of the volcanic eruption of the island of Krakatoa, in August, 1883. It seems at first to be just an account of an event that although huge and dramatic, it's still, you know, a ""science"" book. But when you start to put it together with the current events, the war in Iraq, the conflicts stemming from Islamic fundamentalism, and especially after the earthquake and tsunami of 12/26/04, and the ensuing global aid efforts, the pieces begin to fall into place in your mind. Something, some bit of knowledge that seemed just out of reach, suddenly is clarified. It's simply a treasure, and I've bought it twice now, and I want to find an edition that has maps and charts, etc. I'll buy it again, if I find such a thing. This is simply one of the best books I've read in years, for many reasons."
3,Fascinating but too many detours,"I wanted to adore this book. After all, the eruption of Krakatoa was one of the most important events of the past millennium, and yet most people know nothing about it. But Simon Winchester took this rich, interesting topic and somehow made it about himself. I was truly absorbed by his theory that modern Islamic fundamentalism could be traced to Indonesian fury over the Dutch reaction to the eruption. Facts like that were incredibly good. But I could do without Winchester going on about his youth as a rock collector or whatnot. This book could have been a great one if it weren't for the writer being so impressed with himself. Instead, it's a great book only when the writer really gets down to business and digs into the topic. In that 75%, it's fantastic. And it made me think not a few times of the recent tsunami."
4,Suprising connection,"When I picked this book up, I was planning on reading a simple story of a huge natural disaster. Instead, I got a lot more than I bargained for, and in the grand scheme of things, that's not so bad. I hesitate to call a mere 430 page book ""sprawling,"" but this one has such tremendous breadth and ambition that it reads more like an epic. That's no slam on Winchester; he does a tremendous job of connecting the dots between incredible events of nature with their socio-political consequences. In this instance, he makes a very compelling and timely case for the Krakatoa eruption affecting the eventual takeover of Indonesia by radical Islamist factions. I do wish we could have had more description of the physical effects of the disaster, and more contemporary information on the island of Rakata today. And, call me juvenile, but a few more pictures and CLEAR, READABLE, USER-FRIENDLY maps would have been nice also. But, overall, Winchester does a fine job of bringing history alive."
5,Winchester Takes You on a Journey,"The joy of a Winchester book is in the wide variety of interesting and insightful discoveries that he can weave into the main subject. He is my new Ambrose, wherever he leads, I follow along on an fascinating journey.This books is not just about a volcano. It has insights into exploration, colonization, botony, plate techtonics, and many other interesting subjects. But you do not need a deep or even modest understanding of them, as Winchester smoothly explains the key details in easy to understand and interesting ways.Needless to say, I loved this book and I am working my way through the rest of the Winchester library."
4,Information overload,"This book tells the tale of the eruption of the volcano Krakatoa in 1883, with the resulting destruction and death of about 35,000 people. However, in addition to that story, the author has included page after page of info about the formation of the earth, the history of the East Indies, Dutch colonialism, geology, geography, plate tectonics, and a whole host of other, somewhat intersting, subjects. These additions really bog down the story, and at times tend to have the eyes glaze over while reading. As long as you can slog through the mundane parts, and read about the eruption, you will enjoy this book. If you like your nonfiction laced and larded with facts like an encyclopedia, you will also enjoy this book. Most of us fall somewhere in the middle."
2,Written like a technical journal article,"When I heard the author interviewed on NPR I rushed out and purchased a copy of the book. What a disappointment! As an avid reader I hate to abandon a book after I start it. I did finish Krakatoa but it was a real struggle - actually more of a challenge to prove I could do it. The book is verbose, written like a technical journal article and is overloaded with footnotes and run on sentences. For a 350+ page book, surprisingly little deals with the actual eruption and aftermath. It's more of a book about the geology, politics, biology, botany, and economic history of Java/Sumatra. Although there are several maps in the book, none of them actually says ""this is where Krakatoa was"". The author assumes you'll be able to figure it out by reading about a bunch of obsure landmarks and then looking at a map."
2,Not what I wanted,If you want a book that tells you about the Krakatoa eruption only--this is not your book. This one goes back to the settlement of the area in extreme detail. You don't get close to the eruption until after 200 pages. This is more like a history text in my opinion. I am not even sure I will finish reading it.
2,"Winchester: As a writer, this bloke's a fine geologist","Repetitious and full of digression, this book concentrates on substituting personal stories and the author's deep knowledge of geology for a general history. Some of it is interesting, but it takes 150 pages to actually get to the eruption and the times directly leading up to it. Too much unnecessary background, and too much about Simon's personal life.Discerning readers would be better off reading something else besides this. The guy can't decide whether he's writing for fellow geologists (a party crowd, no doubt), a personal travelog (at these points, his vivid description and interesting anecdotes are as scintillating as Aunt Patsie's Branson Missouri slides)or a serviceable history suitable to the casual reader. He does all of these (even fairly well at times), but the whole is incoherent and a mind-numbing slog.I can't wait to avoid any further literary work on his part."
2,Boring and long,"It would seem that a story about one of the biggest natural disasters the world has experienced would, by necessity, be a compelling read. Instead, Mr. Winchester tries to link everything from pepper plants to religious fundamentalism to the island eruption, yielding a long and boring narrative that jumps back and forth between subjects. If you can remember being in a professor's hot afternoon classroom as he drones on about his detailed opinions and observations, then this is the same feeling you will get from trying to read the book. Sorry, but I couldn't force myself to finish it. Find a copy on the bookshelf of your favorite retailer, skip to page 200 and read the limited 40 pages about the actual eruption, then put the book back on the shelf for some other hapless buyer to purchase. Overall, a real disappointment."
1,A Boring Read,"I really expected an exciting read, but what You get is three quarters of a book full of REALLY BORING FILLER! Was a waste of time and money!"
3,"Good, but not riveting","A decent tale that contains many of Winchester's trademark tangents and sidelines. It seems that Krakatoa was perhaps not big enough to adequately use all of Winchester's prodigious writing talents. For my tastes, Winchester does better as a world traveler and writer than as a geologist. I have read many of Winchester's books and, if you liked The Map that Changed the World, you will like the geology and geography of Krakatoa. If, however, you are not particularly interested in these subjects, I would advise Winchester's Pacific Rising or The Sun Never Sets, both of which I enjoyed a fair amount more."
3,Mixed topics of interest,"This book is a mixed bag. It combines the authors vast knowledge of many subjects with the inability to get to the point. The book was intended to be about the great volcanic eruption of Krakatoa, which destroyed the island and caused havoc. A fascinating story indeed. But this book rambles from subject to subject. From the history of spices to navigation to geology and finally, two thirds of the way through the book the actual event is described, but by this time many readers will be bored to death. This is a wonderful book and the prose is beyond comparison, but it does include a variety of subject, someone with an eclectic mind will enjoy this fine account but if you are only interested in the event this may not be the best book."
2,Interesting Subject Killed With Minutiae,"I really enjoy books that describe the 'bigger picture' that frame individual events. But this book is so far down that road that it lost the main event of the title. Honestly, knowing the construction of transoceanic telegraph cable or knowing if Wallace or Darwin was first to realize evolution theory is way more than I need to know to understand the context of devastating volcanic eruptions. When I finally got to Krakatoa blowing up, this same obsessive detailing detracted from the real power and horror of this terrible event. If you chose to read this, skip to the final third of the book....you'll be a lot more satisfied."
2,Disappointing,"This cumbersome, meandering volume was a real disappointment. Written in an academic and uncaptivating style with so many asides and footnotes that the reading experience was exhausting. Though an avid reader, I gave up on this book after 200 pages. Though the content was good, the writing was scattered and too detailed; the author's scope too large; and his points poorly interrelated. Pick it up at your local library if you must."
3,A Good Read - but tries to hit too many points.,"I thoroughly enjoyed The Professor and the Madman and expected more of the same from Krakatoa. It is good and worth reading, but falls short of his previous best-seller. The maps are atrocious. His explanation of plate tectonics theory is cumbersome (and it does not stress that it is still only a theory, as all our musings about science are). The narratives of the explosion are, however, wonderful and should not be missed. If this book were only two-thirds the size, it would have rated an 'excellent'."
3,Wrong topic for this eccentric writer,"Simon Winchester is truly a first-rate writer with a distinctive style. He comes across as kind of a Victorian professor, a tone which is perfect for some of his other works such as ""The Professor and the Madman"" and his history of the Oxford English Dictionary. However, I don't think his style works for the subject matter at hand here. I doubt there is another recent work of natural history which contains more instances of the words ""splendid"" and ""delightful."" Winchester never met a tangent that he didn't find fascinating, and again, while that approach works with other subject matter, it is distracting here."
3,Would not Re-read This Book,"Krakatoa: The Day the Earth Exploded is a very oddly written book. I had the idea this book would be about volcanoes, looking specifically at the Krakatoa islands but Simon Winchester does not go into detail on the explosion until the middle chapters. Thinking the whole book was about this volcano, I was a bit surprised when the whole first chapter was on the history of the pepper plant and where they are found. I was not expecting that after reading the inside cover and googling other summaries of the book. Throughout the book there are awkward breaks in the writing separating different ideas which took a while to get used to. I think this book could be improved by better organization and a more in depth summary on the inside cover of the book. When Simon Winchester finally started talking about the volcanoes the book got more interesting. It was still pretty focused on the history part of the islands and other dull topics."
3,More required reading for aspiring neocons,"Although it could be described as a romantic account of a coming of age, Masters does not coat the events with over much sugar. What he does reveal is the futility of much of the British effort to control the various tribes inhabiting the NW Frontier areas. One hopes that this lesson could be taught at West Point. It does not seem to have gotten assimilated anywhere else.As a prelude to Masters novels about India it makes a great reading, and presents a not overly sentimental account of a way of life now long gone. The account of the ""fishing fleet"" of young English ladies who sailed out to India in the hopes of meeting a young subaltern for marriage, and the appalling conditions in which they lived and pretended to be in the suburbs of London, is both honest and hilarious."
1,What Suede??,"Signature Series Dash Cover 81237-00-25; BlackWhat suede? This does NOT look like any kind of suede leather I've ever seen. It looks, (and feels), like velvet CLOTH! I have no confidence it will form-fit my dash. I have no confidence it will look like it belongs. I will use it; if nothing else, it should, at least, protect the dash from further sun damage."
2,"good concept, bad execution","The book's concept is good, a collection of oral histories of workers from Jones & Laughlin in Aliquippa, Pennsylvania. However, the editing is absolutely atrocious. Typos and spelling errors abound, and at no point does the author offer to explain anything the workers are talking about. If you're knowledgeable about the steelmaking process, you will understand some of the things they say, but the author could have put in footnotes to clarify some of their points or make some things more understandable. The editing of this book greatly detracts from the overall work, and after a while, becomes outright frustrating. That's too bad; these workers lived hard lives, and they clearly have something to say. Too bad the author and publisher couldn't help them with that."
3,Not the best choice,"While more accessable than the frustratingly over-detailed Lambton, this book still focuses too much on archaic rules of grammar, often presented in an unintelligable manner. The reading excercises are outdated ie ""His August Imperial Majesty opened..."" and contain vocabulary which is questionably useful for the beginner. Because it is attempting to equip the reader to deal with classical as well as modern texts, much of the grammatical information and vocabulary is not necessary for active use, although this is not made clear and many modern usesages are overlooked or mentioned only in passing. Thackston is the book to use for the beginner who whishes to make quick and satisfying progress in the language and perhaps Lambton for those who want an obscure reference grammar. This book, unfortunately serves neither purpose adequately."
2,Be careful with this bulb,"I'd suggest caution on two notes:1) I bought this bulb thru amazon with the intent of replacing my '00 nissan altima's headlight bulbs. But the product label says ""For offroad use only"", implying it may be illegal to use as replacement bulb for normal use.2) The item looked very flimsy and one of the bulbs (it comes as pair) was already broken when it arrived. I had to get RMA and return it to the seller. By the way BuyNow seller is subsidiary of Buy.com and they have a decent return policy.Apart from that the product is probably value for money... at $5.99 for two bulbs!"
4,All types of drama!,Til Death Do Us Part was filled with stories that were full of drama and fast paced. I particularly enjoyed the story where the couple was living in different cities and were tring to keep their relationship together. The author did a good job in showing their emotions about being away from each other.
2,expected more,I was very disappointed with this book: a collection of short stories Mr White didn't seem to want to take the time to finish. Too bad because one or two had the makings of a great novel.
3,This one I didn't care for,"I am a great fan of Mr. White's, yet for some reason, this book left me cold. Perhaps because I read the story of the long distance couple who chose career over their marriage. After that, it was a downhill slide, and I didn't bother to read much after that.Now, I am not going to say that the book stinks completely, because it just my opinion here, plus I didn't read it all in its entirety. So do take this with a serious grain of salt."
4,Enjoyable,"I enjoyed this book very much. I have read all of Franklins books and he has a very gifted talent. I particularly loved two of the stories in this book. The one about the ex black panther and his wife called ""Love So Deep"" and the very last one which brought tears to my eyes, Before I Go. Keep up the good work always a fan."
4,Impressive,A very good book that will open your eyes to people who are trying thier best to stay together. Looking forward to this authors next book.
4,Good!,"This was a pretty good book. I have read Franklin's other two novels and this one was on a different level. When I first started to read this book I was wondering where was he coming from. Then I continued to read and I got the whole concept. This is a book with several stories about the good, bad and ugly of marriage and just relationships. I bet anyone who reads this book will be able to relate to at least one story. I favor the conclusion to Fed Up With the Fanny and also Miles Apart. The conclusion was really surprising and I was taken away with it. I think people will enjoy this book, just don't give up on it to soon."
3,I can't say the same...,"I have previously enjoyed Franklin's work, but I can't say the same about this one. I think it was far too many shorts, it may have been better with fewer stories. I must have missed something the other reviewers saw, because I thought this book tried to do and say to much. The cutiest story in the book was the one about the older couple. So, overall I would have to disagree with the other reviewer and give it only a 3, passable but barely. Sorry Franklin..."
4,Give My Regards to The Widow...,"I enjoyed much of this book for how it shows what relationships should be and should not be; how they are good and not so good for people; but most of all for how they (relationships) always manage to survive in the way they need to survive -- despite the people who are involved in them. Passion, romance, comfort, betrayal, love, lust, anger and peace are all well covered across the various stories.I would have liked a little more structure and cohesion between the stories or some way to flow from one area of relationships to another, but I guess the book wound up working like marriages -- it was quirky yet familiar, predictable yet surprising, comforting yet refreshing just when you need it to be -- in the end its ""Just Different""..."
4,The greatest of these is love. (I Corinthians 13:13),"I thoroughly enjoyed these short love stories which give readers a hunger and thirst for more... love!Til' Death Do Us Part is a collection of short stories about couples of all ages. These stories will make you laugh, cry, and fall in love. ""Love So Deep"" and others stories in this collection contain the makings of additional books. While helping us to capture the essence of love, Franklin White also reminds us how precious and short time is. It is essential that we LOVE AND LIVE in the now because we never know how long that is, in hours, days, weeks, years.Don't let another moment pass without falling in love with these rich morsels and the tasty characters who give flavor to each story."
5,Great Live Band,Awesome CD! So are the rest of the O.A.R. collection. I think this band is one of the best kept secrets in music today. They have a great fan base that makes live shows amazing! I recommend this CD
4,NY Fan...,"I was very excited when this cd came out.. I enjoy the range of different songs on there from the upbeat ""Hey Girl"" to the slow ""James"". I think this cd has been the best cd yet. I especially love the dvd.. Well mostly because I'm in it..Thanx guys for a great album."
2,Where did the raggae go? O.A.R. (Made For Radio),"Where did the raggae go? I have been the biggest O.A.R. fan ever since the release of the Wanderer, and I have always lived by their music. In Between Now and Then is not the true sound of O.A.R. that I know, instead it is the band's made for radio and tv version. I read another review that said In Between Now and Then sounds like pop-rock, and I agree. Except for two or three exception all of the raggae feel is gone, the song's corus are bland, and the energy has been taken out. I still listen to the album because it is still O.A.R, but it is no where near the level of all their other albums. O.A.R. please take away the requests of the new label and be yourselves!!! DON'T SELL OUT!!!!!! GO WITH ANY TIME NOW, or any of their first three other albums (Wanderer, Souls Aflame, and Risen)"
5,Excellent CD,"O.A.R. is an oustanding band that has grown a lot over the past few years. You can definitely hear the maturation of the band through the band's releases from Wanderer to Any Time Now, and now In Between Now and Then. This is by far their best studio CD and definitely worth picking up. Right on Time has a lot of energy, Road Outside Columbus shows that they appreciate their time at Ohio State, and Any Time Now shows the influence of Marley's Reggae beat. I highly recommend this CD/DVD pack."
5,Of A Revolution,This is a great CD!! O.A.R. is the only band where I could pop one of their cd's in my cd player and play it straight through. In Between Now and Then is no exception. I can't get sick of it!!
5,One Word...Amazing,O.A.R. in my opinion is the best band out there. They are outstanding/amazing musicians but their music is still very Fun and Catchy. You will be Blown away and hooked in a second. In Between Now and demonstrates this perfectly. I Recommend buying all their CD's. This is the real deal. Go see them live they are even better.
5,This CD is phenomenal,"O.A.R. continues to excel. This CD may not be as catchy as some of their others but it does not take a step back. It's a bit of a different sound but it is awesome. ""Right on Time"" is the best track in my opinion. If you are an O.A.R. fan you will not be disappointed!"
4,If you like the CD you have to see them Live,2002 was the year I was exposed to O.A.R. It was at the Jeep World Outdoor Festival and by a friends suggestion of checking this group out we stayed and we were completely blown away. This C.D. is great and it has a nice flow to it. If your into music with a good vibe this is the C.D. for you! Can't wait for O.A.R. to return to Michigan I'll definately be back to see them live.
5,O.A.R. great release,"A jam band with a sing-a-long feel, O.A.R. hit their major label debut with a burst. This band is a cross between Dave Matthews Band, John Mayer, and Jack Johnson all rolled up with a midwest twist. If you are looking for a good album all the way through, this is a great addition to any collection. Also, look into their earlier recordings."
2,SELLOUT CD!!,"I used to love o.a.r., but i was extremely dissapointed with this cd. Its ashame how this album abandons the awesome folky, reggae, alternative blend of music o.a.r. used to play and instead transformed into a poppy, easy-listening sellout band. If you want quality o.a.r., get any time now, there awesome live cd, or any other cd they've put out before this. Just do urself a favor and dont buy this [bad] sellout album."
2,Christian Music,"I'm surprised nobody has mentioned the strong Christian influence in this album. Too many of these songs are about ""God"", ""heaven"", ""ascention"", or being ""blessed"". If I want to be preached to then I'll look for music in the ""religious"" music section.Fairly decent musically, but c'mon. I didn't expect evangelical music from a supposedly mainstream band. If you're non-Christian (and most of us on earth *aren't* Christian), stay away. This album will give you the impression that they're trying to convert you."
5,Fantastic,"O.A.R.'s first forey into the major record label industry was a complete success. After being on their own independant label for many years, the band has created a wonderful album with Everfine Records. The unique sound of O.A.R. is uplifting and generally all-around happy. I highly recommend this CD, or any O.A.R. CD to anyone who enjoys listening to music that will make them feel good."
5,Absolutely fantastic,"Just got this disc yesterday and all I can say is that it is amazing. The work that O.A.R. put into this album is highly evident, and the dvd is great. I love seeing them live and this limited dvd is the best way to go if you can't.. I think this is the best effort this band has ever put forth...Absolutely amazing!!"
5,The Revolution Has Begun,"This is simply an amazing CD! Their first single, Hey Girl, is simple but upbeat with a great groove. Right on Time is probably my favorite song on the disc, but they're seriously all amazing. Their last studio release was a tad overproduced, but this one came out perfect... It's a must add to your collection."
2,A Shame,this cd by oar i say was the worst i have ever heard them sing. these songs left the rock and ragae music that they used to sing. they have changed the lyric from poker and beer to love songs. i hope they can come out with a new one much better than this.
4,A word from the puffy eye crowd,"I use this product because my wife handed it to me and said, ""Try this."" I'm 66 with sleep apnea, so I think I'm a good test subject for it's effectiveness against some real world problems. I teach classes, so I'm constantly speaking in front of crowds. This product definitely works for me. It reduces puffiness and wrinkles and makes me look and feel younger. It's not plastic surgery in a bottle, but for my purposes it's worth the investment."
1,too oily,I tried this stuff for several weeks and mostly it just made the skin under my eyes all oily. I saw no change in puffiness and discontinued use after about 6 weeks.The only nice thing I can say about this product is that it smells pleasant.
3,Flawed but entertaining,"Also, I will add, apparantly written by Avram Davidson and not the original authors who wrote under the Ellery Queen psuedonym.Be that as it may, this is an intriguingly written mystery in four parts, each part focussing on one of the four principle characters. Ellery doesn't show up until the 2nd part and there's a rather humorous twist at the conclusion involving the actual solving of the case.It is spoiled to a degree by various flaws, but still is fun reading for Ellery Queen fans albeit a bit sophisticated compared to the earlier books."
3,Okay,I was looking more for a hot dip book exclusively & just ordered based on covers. Only had a few recipes I wanted.
1,Bought in U.S and shipped to Venezuela,Internal parts made probably out of US. No a good quality control certification. The trigger broke the frist time I used. I do not recommended it.
1,disappointment,This is a very poor rendering of the music of Victor Herbert. I am very disappointed in it and would not have ordered it if I realized that there were no vocals.
5,Christmas in mid Summer,"This is a well done, well written movie about finding Love and having a second chance to redeem it. My family will enjoy this story for many years.Linda"
1,Save your money,"I was disappointed with this movie. My best advice is rent the movie and be your own judge. If you like it, buy it. If I had doen this, I would never have wasted money for this. It just wasn't a well written script."
5,LOVE this movie!,I love this movie. Such a lovely message while giving giggles throughout. It's a must-see for me every year so I decided I needed to just buy it for myself!
1,Blue Christmas,"I'm a sucker for anything Christmas. I generally have decent taste in movies the rest of the year, but come Christmas-time, I lap up these sappy movies. But even I couldn't stomach this one. The screenplay and the acting were so pathetic that the entire time I was watching it I wondered if this was made as a result of a bet that a Christmas movie could be written and shot in 3 days that suckers like me would buy. What a waste of money & time!"
1,Do Not waste your money or your time!,The movie starts out really goofy and she is an avid drinker. The front of the DVD looks fun and Christmas like. NOT!
4,Heartwarming and good for an evening in.........,"For anyone who has ever longed for a second chance with the one they ""gave away"".....for anyone who has ever wished they could go back and do something over in a different way...have that second chance to say things that went unsaid or maybe to try and say them better...or even just the urge to re-experience a special point in time when ""feeling"" was what life was all about, this movie should be right up your alley.It is a sweet and charming little love story that i have actually watched a few times.......and still like it!"
4,Long time no see,I've been looking for this movie for a good while. Saw it when it first came out on the Halmark channel. Was happy to find it's still as entertaining as I remembered.
4,Grammercy Park,Loved this book! I am now hooked on this series. I have started to go back an read from the beginning. I like the characters that's what drew me into the series Malloy and Dr Brandt. I look forward to what is going to happen next. Before I even finish the book. I can't wait to see what's going to happen next. Very enjoyable read!
4,Murder on grammercy Park,"I've gotten hooked on the series. This was as engaging as the others i the series and the characters are interesting. If you like a look at the turn of the century (1900s) NYC, with the mores, activities, environments, and customs of the period you will like these books."
4,good read,Her perfect stories have real imperfect peopleexample --- the little deaf boy --- and that politicshave always been there ( like it or not )
3,Somewhat like a TV mystery,"This is my first V Thompson and I'd buy the others as the books should be read in sequence. The author refers to events in previous books quite often.Gramercy Park is very good light reading and, like watching TV, doesn't require you to think too much. Clues come in simple batches. The plot wasn't that straightforward but became extremely obvious towards the end.My only bugbear is that V Thompson repeats herself excessively, possibly a problem with editing. For example, EVERY time the mother is mentioned she has ""lovely"" eyes. Enough already!!"
3,Not what I expected,The extremely small print made this book very difficult to read and maintain interest. I wish I'd not ordered 3 just like this.
4,Worthy Reading,"MURDER ON GRAMERCY PARK is the best book yet in the series. It stands on it's own merits, but I think it's helpful to have read the previous two books so the reader can get a good feel for how the relationship between Sarah and Frank is developing. This book had an interesting mystery that had me turning pages and I can't wait until the next installment so I can find out how Brian's surgery went !"
4,3rd entry in Gaslight Mystery series another success,"Murder on Gramercy Park by Victoria Thompson is the third book in the Gaslight Mystery series starring midwife Sarah Brandt and Detective Sergeant Frank Malloy. In this entry, Edmund Blackwell a magnetic healer is murdered in his own home, and it seems like everyone had a reason to kill him, including his pregnant wife, his unknown son, his business partner and many more. Thompson does a good job spreading the blame around so that everyone looks guilty. The growing relationship between Sarah and Frank is gaining strength as they both acknowledge their feelings for each other. The dialogue isn't as snappy as in other mysteries, but it's still very enjoyable to read."
2,not a very good cd.,"noisy and all over the place,and the beat is kind of redundant and boring. just got annoyed by it."
4,Authenic rural Egyptian grooves,"The cd is about the closest that Westeners minus the plane tripe will get to rural Egyptian music. Most of the songs comes from parts of extreme southern Egypt[that is Luxor and Aswan] but some tracks are a little further north in places like Qena which border Middle Egypt. The previous reviewers have unfairly branded this as unauthenic. Such criticism does not suprise be due to lack of understanding or knowledge that some have of rural Egypt. I would argue that this cd is more Egyptian than most sha'abi due to the lack of western influence.Anybody that is into anthropology or field recordings is for a musical treat. All the music is supervised by the late Nubian ethnomusicology/oud player,Hamaza el Din. The only thing missing from a otherwise wonderful cd is funeral laments from Luxor and fallahin music from the Delta. Buy this Cd if you are into rural Egyptian music or a anthropology buff."
1,Very primitive; monotonous; very little rythem variation,I purchased this CD once and took it right back for an exchange. I love most Middle EAstern music but this one was difficult for me to listen to.
2,Really not great,"I bought this because I got it for really cheap (around $5 with shipping) and am still disappointed in it. My galaxy S3 doesn't fit the case very well and none of the buttons are exposed. I use this for running and listen to Pandora a lot. When I want to change the song it is nearly impossible to press the ""screen on"" button, and then change the song and turn then turn off the screen. I really couldn't recommend this case to anyone."
2,poor quality,"the knife i received should have never left the company , it should have been deemed as poor quality, i have order shrade knives before old timer and uncle henry and never had a problem , the seller should have inspected this knife before shipment, for the price i pay i am keeping this knife since it would be a hassle to send it back."
3,What! Made in China?,"I ordered this new Schrade knife because I've had one like it for years and It's as solid now as the day I bought it over 15yrs ago. I thought it would be nice to have another one. I was disappointed as soon as I opened the box and saw th sheath. I would describe it as ""pleather sheath"" When I took out the knife out of the sheath I could tell right away that It wasn't the same. It's thinner and lighter than My old one. When I opened the knife the blade was stamped made in China. I found out the original Schrade went out of business and the name was acquired by another company. I should have researched it before I ordered it. So that being said, This knife is similar in appearance and seems to function properly. Time will tell If will perform as well as My old one."
1,Terrible,"I don't often write reviews on Amazon but my experience with this knife prompted me to do so. The quality of this knife is abysmal!!!! I used to have a Schrade Old Timer that I bought long ago. It was fantastic! Unfortunately I lost it on a vacation. I immediately got on to Amazon and bought what I thought would be the exact same knife. WRONG! When I took it out of the package I could see that the quality was substandard by any measure. The locking mechanism is loose, rattling from side to side. The handle is made of cheap plastic, etc. You get the idea. It is a piece of garbage. Don't buy this knife! Look for something else."
2,No Old Timer here.,This is a ten dollar flea market knife with Schrade's name on it. Sorry but I was pretty disappointed when I opened the package. The first thing I noticed was that the snap on the case was not centered correctly so the cover sits to one side a hair. One of the handles has a 32th of an inch gap where it is supposed to meet the brass. Lastly it has sharp edges besides the blade. The edges of the lock are pretty sharp as well as the brass where the blade closes. I bought this knife to use at work and it's going to take a beating. It's not worth the time to send it back. I'll just write off Schrade off as one of those American companies that gave up. I do love Amazon though!
2,Chinese garbage,"immediately disappointed as soon as i opened the box and pulled it out.Way lighter compared to when the good old U.S.A made these knives and realy cheeply made. Crappy plastic on the handle,not to mention a few scratches on the handle as well.i was gonna buy a bunch of these for stocking stuffers but that has changed.The only good thing about my order was how fast i recieved it.From now on im sticking to american made.Goodbye schrade nice knowin you."
2,Made in China,"Again, I knew this knive was MIC, but thought I'd give it a try for the price. I have an older version Made in the USA and there is no comparison to the quality and workmanship of the USA made knive. As a hunter and trapper I use this knife, it doesn't just sit around looking good. My advise is save your money and buy an american made knife."
4,Like it,"A very sturdy knife. Sharp, solid blade. Only criticism is that the sheath is made of cheap imitation leather, but I don't plan to use it so it doesn't bother me."
4,Great gift,Got it for my dad as a gift and for someone who uses knives on a regular bases He loved it! Kinda wish now that I had purchased two cause now I have to wait for mine.
4,Schrade is a great knife,"The only problem was the case looks cheaper . Only because I have older old timer, and the belt case it""s made much better."
5,Ugly Doll Ice bat,My wife and son play with this thing constantly. One of them always has it. So far it has held up very well to their abuse.
2,Does not look like the picture!!!,"The black ice bat I received has different feet and 5 teeth all bunched in the middle of his mouth instead of the cute lay out of the 4 you see in the picture here. It's not a huge thing I guess (tho it does piss me off I was deceived), but I still can't decide whether to go through with the hassle of returning it or not. It's still kind of cute, but it is no way in hell worth $50!! This doll is seriously highway robbery...."
4,unpaid helper,"A friend loaned to me his T-Jak to use when I install cabinets. I used to put a cleat on the wall first, leaving holes from screws after removing. Since I started using the T-Jak, I've been able to install 3 to 4 more cabinets per day, It's like having a helper, and not having to pay him. I install the bases first, then the uppers. If during installation, it turns out that I have to raise or lower the cabinet, it's just a simple turn of the screw to move it up or down. My only complaint is that the base of the T-Jak is a bit small and is prone to tipping, but I remidied that by attaching a 12"" x 18"" piece of plywood to the bottom for added stability. If you install cabinets on a regular basis, you should buy this tool!"
3,What a Great Idea,"Too bad the manufactures of this tool never got past the hardware store component prototype version. Buy it if you must, it does work well, but you could easily replicate this thing almost perfectly with parts from your local hardware store. When my order arrived, I felt as though I had just been hoodwinked. I originally ordered both the tall and short versions and all of the extensions, but after realizing what they were, I kept the Mini-Brut and returned everything else and got the extensions at the hardware store for relatively little cost."
1,Buyer Beware. Wait for the real thing. This is more PD junk.,"Someday, we will see a wonderful DVD collection of the great Max Fleischer and Famous Studios POPEYE cartoons released by their rightful owner, Warner Bros., as soon as the studio is given the blessing of the character's owner, King Features Syndicate.Meanwhile, opportunistic companies ready to profit from other entities' properties without paying royalties market these cartoons under the guise that they are ""public domain"". The loser is the unknowing consumer that innocently buys this garbage. That's exactly what this latest Popeye compilation is, and it's bad. Plain and simple. Cobbled together from inferior prints, anyone can do better recording these cartoons off television than buying this trash.Don't waste your money. Wait for the real deal. It'll be worth its weight in spinach!"
3,"No ""We aim to Please""....","To ""Big Mike"", sorry, ""We aim to Please"" is not on this set. Also one of my faves, for Wimpy's line: ""Watch me obtain a hamburger without the necessary fee""! Catch it on Cartoon Network's Popeye Show (although it may not be shown in the U.K.). What a godsend for those of us who do get it.Re: this set...it don't suck. Better'n nuttin's my opinion."
3,But just where is We Aim To Please?,"Just wondering if anyone can please possibly tell me if this collection includes We Aim To Please from 1934? If not, then perhaps where I can find it? This was later remade as Spree Lunch. In We Aim To Please, Popeye and Olive run a diner together and Wimpy utters his famous I'll gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today line for the very first time ever in the cartoons. Can anyone please help me to find this neglected classic Popeye cartoon?"
5,Popeye DVD,"I noticed some of the reviews were mixed. Well, my kids LOVED this DVD. They loved it so much, I had to hide the DVD in order to take a break from Popeye and his friends. Yes, the clarity isn't perfect, however, it by all means is not dismal. I saw nothing wrong with the clairty and I can honestly say that my kids wouldn't care if there was a problem. They just want to see what silly thing Popeye is up to next. I would definitely recommend this DVD to anyone who loves Popeye or wants to introduce their kids to Popeye of yesteryear."
5,My kids love it!,"My kids ages 6 and 8 want to watch this over and over again, they just love it. I will be looking for more Popeye to buy! Great to see these classics again."
5,popeye the sailor man,"Popeye the sailor man. I've always like him and that goes back to about 1940. I still laugh at his crazy cartoons. I think Popeye is an all American stalwart, I mean that in a very good sense."
5,Some of Arnold's Best,"Malcolm Arnold is an absolute master of the orchestra thanks to long experience as a player (trumpet) in London orchestras, to his experience as a film composer and conductor (Bridge on the River Kwai, for instance), and to his natural gifts as a composer. He has a strong, well-profiled melodic sense and a superb rhythmic sense. These overtures are prime examples in miniature form of his work, and the peformances are impeccable: authoritative from the man himself, who knows just how to get the results he wants from the players. He lets his creations bloom in a way that holds your attention - and brings you back for repeated hearings. If you do not know Arnold, this is a perfect introduction. If you do know his work, why are you reading this; you should be ordering it! (Technically, the disc is beyond reproach in the best Reference tradition.)"
2,"Good lock, terrible holder","The lock itself is everything you would expect it to be, compact, secure, and perfect for commuting. The silver tab on the stem that seats into the carrier however is a piece of junk. The collar is not secured to the actual lock ring so it is able to swivel which it does while you are riding. If you have the holder located on the one place on a bike that has space for it (the vertical post under the seat)like i do, then you will be constantly banging your legs against the lock as it sways back and forth as you ride. Really annoying. Now I know why I see most people carrying these locks in their belt loops instead of on the bike as it was designed."
4,Great U-Lock,This U Lock is great but its a little to small to fit in alot of places so I can only put it around my bike frame and not the rear tire I was trying to fit it around a Parking meter took a while to get it around it I even scratched my bike frame in the process I think I should have gotten the Evolution standard but besides that I have no complaint.
3,neutral feelings,works great. only down size is that im not able to lock both my frame and front wheel at the same time.
2,Not as good as one might think,"This was a terrible lock. For one, I kept having a hard time trying to lock it into position with the bike clamp. Even after spraying some WD-40 on it, I was still having problems. Whenever I do manage to lock it into place, pulling it back out became a whole new problem, and oftentimes, it would slam into the frame of my bike because of how much force was needed to pull it out. Lastly, the clamp itself is extremely cumbersome. Instead of traditional screws, it uses a plastic belt. Once I had it locked in, I couldn't undo it to re-adjust. I ended up returning this lock and getting aOnGuard Bulldog MINI TC 5013TC Bicycle U-Lockinstead. The bulldog is a much, much better lock because the clamp uses screws the the latching is actually done from the side, so it won't damage your bike."
1,Don't risk your bike with this lock!!!!,"There is a serious flaw to these locks: the keys open multiple Kryptonite locks. I guess they were too cheap to manufacture unique key threads for each lock. After locking my bike up in a well lit area in front of a popular eatery, I returned 15 minutes later to find the lock still attached to bike hoop without my bike. Another reviewer mentioned this problem with Kryptonite locks in Amazon reviews. However, I didn't think much of it and regretfully purchased the Evolution Mini. Now I am out of a bike and stuck with a lock that too risky to use.I suggest you purchase some other lock than the Kryptonite Evolution Mini."
4,Very secure lock; doesn't fit all poles; mount hard to install,"This lock is very secure and I feel comfortable using this to lock my bike in public. It doesn't add too much weight, which is important because I need to carry my bike one flight of stairs to my apartment.The mount that this lock came with took a lot of effort to install. It wasn't easy at all. Almost injured my hand trying to wrap the plastic mount around my bike frame. Once the mount is on, it's pretty much impossible to remove. The lock can then be attached to the mount.The U-lock itself is smaller than normal. It fits most bike racks, but I've had trouble locking it to a few poles outside that were just a little too thick."
2,Lasted 2 years before my bike stolen,"I have a cruiser and wondered if this little lock would work on most poles/ racks. It does, and is easier to handle than a big lock. The holder is a little wierd and you have to push the lock down on it hard to get it to stick in there, not a graceful solution. AlsO I have locking skewers on my wheels so I just need to lock the frame, for wheel and frame it will not work.REVISED 6/12. I had 2 good years with my bike and this lock. Just got stolen. Don't know how. Very sad."
5,Awesome lock,Great lock. Seems very very tough and hard to break. The mounting hardware is great too. Great design and functionality.
2,Too short,"I bought this with the intent of locking my bike around a stop sign and being able to lock both the front wheel and the frame to the sign. Wow was I dissapointed. It's only able to barely lock around the frame to street furniture like parking signs or stop signs. I can't imagine it being any good at locking to an actual bike rack! This is really better off used as a supplementary lock. Get something larger if you intend to ride around an urban environment. I suppose the locking mechanism works fine, but I haven't had much use for it as it's so useless in my environment."
2,Just Too Small!,"I really wanted this Mini -- per Sheldon Brown (bike mechanic extraordinaire) and the reviewers here... and I really didn't want the bulk and weight of the larger one... but this lock is just way, way too small to be easy or effective. It barely fits through either the wheel or the frame and the bike rack - no way will it fit through both. Not good with quick-release wheels! Doesn't fit around the down tube of my road bike frame, either. I had to jimmy and juke my bike up against the rack to get it close enough to click this tiny lock closed around the top of the frame. Um, the metal bike racks in Chicago are thick! It's just not gonna fly. Returning it for the larger one, along with a cable."
1,SUPER small - not worth it...what a waste,"You will barely be able to lock your frame alone to a big rack, let alone tire or anything else. Really a waste. Get the bigger lock...this one is only slightly lighter - still very heavy. GET THE BIGGER ONE!"
1,Missing tool and broken strap,"Very desappointed when the lock arrived tho on time, the key to tie it to the bike was missing and the strap which keeps it in place on the bike was broken ...I bought a new one at the store down the street (same)"
2,"So-so lock, horrible mounting bracket","The lock is OK, but the keys are flimsy and the locking mechanism is finnicky. I am always afraid the key is going to break off in the lock.Also, it is pretty small, so it cannot be used on bikes with wider tires in the recommended locking method (through rear tire and triangle on frame to bike rack). I'm sure it would be fine for bikes with narrow tires, except on very thick bike racks.The mounting bracket is horrible. It cannot be properly secured to a bike frame, and after removing it once, the release for the locking tab was shot. Good thing the lock is small, because now I have to keep it in a handlebar bag."
4,Krytonite Evolution Mini U-Lock,"1. Strong, well built lock2. Relatively light3. Fits in pocket or in belt loop4. Good price"
1,Jmarshall23502,"I bought Kryptonite Evolution lock 6 months ago, and have only used it twice. The lock mechanism, which is apparently cheap, has jammed in the locked position. In this day and age when you just expect things that are much more complex than a simple lock will work reliably, this is just cheap quality. Definitely avoid this product.11/26/12 update: after going to the company's website and reading the troubleshooting section, I was able to fix the problem by inserting a small screwdriver into the keyslot and jiggling to straighten out the tumblers. Since then I've had no problems with the lock after 6 months of use. Seems like a quality control oversite at the factory, but OK once corrected."
4,Bueno,"The Lock is great. I don't like the bike bracket just like many others don't. It passed the Bushwick, Ny test where my last lock failed and bike got stolen."
5,Awesome,I had the NY lock but was so tired of the weight everytime I went out. So as a 'luxury' to myself I got this. You know what makes it extremely bad ass? It fits in a large sized seat bag disassembled! If I wanted to take a lock with me in the past I either had to put it on my pants and constantly pull them up or take a backpack. Seat bag + mini lock = happy rider.
5,The perfect horse book,"I read this book when I was younger, but I still have many fond memories of it. K.M. Peyton knows exactly how every horse-crazy young girl feels. The story details the struggles of a British girl as she tries to care for her own pony and compete in pony trials. With detailed descriptions, Peyton deftly recreates the horse show atmosphere. She displays this talent in nearly all of her writings. All horse-loving girls should read this book. I'm sure that they will understand the protagonist's deep passion for horses. Unfortunently, this book has gone out of print in the United States. Hopefully it will be reprinted. The sequel to this book is ""The Team,"" which is also out of print. I would also recommend ""Free Rein,"" ""Prove Yourself a Hero,"" and ""Flambards,"" also by K.M. Peyton. All of these titles are hard to find, but some of them are being reprinted in Britain and may be available through Amazon.co.uk."
5,Lifelong Favorite of a Devoted Horsewoman,"The title of this review says it all. It was introduced to me by a much-loved children's librarian when it was first published in the US - I lived, breathed and slept Ruth's story and so, so much wanted to be her, or be like her. I could completely relate to being the outsider among other riders, and feeling that I was walking in the dark. The author is to be commended for her very realistic handling of horses, riding, Pony Club - and the attitudes of other people with horses. The story stands alone beautifully, but I underestand it's the beginning of a series.If you can possibly get your hands on a copy of this, do. Do not, as my 10-year-old self (in 1968) was driven to do when we moved out of that library's district - secretly steal it from the shelf. I was so sure I'd never find another copy of this beloved story, I was moved to larceny. I'm not proud of that, but it was the first and only time I stole as a child - that's how much I loved it."
4,A Girl & Her Pony - How can it be anything but Good?,"I cannot believe I found this book again. I used to check it out of the library all the time when I was 10-14 years old. I loved the story and learned so much about horses - and wished I could live in England and do Pony Club there. But the best thing about this book is that it is so realistic. It's not a formulaic, happy-sappy horse story; it's about a young girl who's a ""have-not"" who works SO HARD to fulfill her dream of owning a pony and fitting in with the Horsey Kids, and not everything goes smoothly. I loved this girl and the fiesty little roan pony she had to buy young and green because she didn't have any money, and I loved the ending (how they get to the Pony Trials at last, and have a victory of sorts even though they don't win). Just a lovely, lovely story. I also really liked the illustrations. Oh . . . and I never knew K.M. Peyton had other horsey books. I plan to read them all."
3,No comprehensive Index again!,"As a university professor in African American Studies, I looked forward to the first edition and bought it. But I was disappointed by the woefully lacking index which is also the case with the 2nd edition.The five-volume 2nd edition is much easier to handle in terms of weight for each volume than the VERY heavy one volume 1st edition. However, one must wonder how Harvard professors (the editors) could allow a lack of a comprehensive index the second time around.I bought the 1st edition, but I recommend not buying the 2nd edition. If a future edition has a comprehensive index, I will buy and would urge you to buy, as there is a wealth of information.As for this (2nd) edition, save your money. Use the volumes at your school/university or community library for good general background information on the African and African American Experience."
2,Don't expect this folding chair to STAY folded up...,"As others have said, this chair is HUGE. It's extremely comfortable however it's weight would make it a challege to take back and forth to the ball park. I knew this going in from the other reviews. What I didn't know was that this chair won't stay folded shut unless it's laying down. If you plan to stand it up against a wall or somewhere else for storage, it won't work. The weight of the chair seems to make this happen. Also, the back does not ""lock"" into any positions other than straight up or totally reclined (about 45 degrees). If you want to have the back in a position somewhere in between, it will slide up and down with you everytime you lift your back up."
3,Brown Prime Plus Folding Chair,"it's very large, which is great for obese individuals, and anyone wanting a comfy-sized lawn chair! but because of it's size, it's not real easy to take from place to place. But for the amount of room, it's worth it! it's a little complicated to get folded out, and reclined... but once you get the hang of it, it's not so bad. Good product over-all!"
1,I Couldn't believe my eyes,"It appears to be a good quality chair, but it is unbelievable HUGE. It is also heavy. It is not a chair you can easily move from place to place and it requires a much larger space than the average folding chair for storage. I decided I didn't want it and was shocked that it was going to cost me over $80 to return it plus there is a restocking fee. Think really carefully before purchasing this extremely oversized chair!"
4,worldview,I love Ken Ham. I believe he is really on to something with how what worldview we raise our children with.
5,Funny,"If you can invision a dog singing these songs and doing these skits, then it's hilarious. If you listen to it and only hear a man talking,then of course it would awkward to you and not very funny. People should open their minds.As for the Clay fans who have been posting, I for one would much rather get humped by Triumph then have to look at a man who highly resembles an albino rat."
1,A steaming pile of crap...,This CD is not funny and it is a major disappointment for people who though Triumph was funny on Conan's show.It's not just the dead silence on the many failed prank calls. It is that the main material is weak.The only decent song is 'I keed'. This is a bait and switch CD. Avoid it.
1,a big disappointment.,"i have never laughed harder watching network tv than i have while watching triumph or any of robert smigel's other characters on conan. so when i heard triumph was putting out an album, i was thrilled and couldn't wait to get it. unfortunately, this album is nothing but terrible songs and completely unfunny jokes. triumph abandons the style of humor that made me love him, and instead relies on cussing. sorry, but the 27th time you say the ""c"" word isn't any funnier than the 26th time. i genuinely feel like i have been stabbed in the back. this album sucks. i want my money back."
1,pure garbage,"This reminds me of school children trying to impress their friends at recess by telling crude insulting ""jokes"" It is not even remotely funny."
1,I should have read the reviews,"Man, what a rip off. Conan should refund my money because I blame him. The bits on his show are hilarious and that's what I was expecting from this CD. Boy was I dissapointed. It's nothing but ""F"" words and the crudest style of humor around. If it had been recordings of the bits on the Conan O'Brien show I would have been completly satisfied."
1,TERRIBLE!,"My brother bought this CD, so we listened to it together. To put it simply, this CD is not funny at all. The jokes are completely unoriginal. People can call Christina Aguilera names in songs only so many times before it gets repetitive. And Triumph's voice REALLY begins to grate on your nerves. Save your money. Go buy the new Beatles album or something."
2,"Nice CD, RIAA Sucks Tho.","Nice CD, well worth the money. But because its release by a RIAA supporting Record company i think ill go download it instead."
1,Neutured Triumph isn't funny,"Whoever the ""creative force""(and I use the term loosely) behind this puppet should really try to do something more worthwhile with their time. Perhaps donating thousands of hours to helping children with autism would be a good place to start."
1,Don't waste your money on this piece of garbage!,Really what has the world come to when a stupid puppet dog with lame jokes can put out an album and people buy it! Are there really enough brain dead people that have nothing better to spend their money on. Our precious resources on this planet were wasted on this worthless CD.... save your money and don't buy this.
1,"Been there, done that","Listened to several tracks, kept having the feeling I'd heard it before. It's kinda sad watching the deterioration of a concept that used to be funny. Something about this album just screams ""Trying way too hard to be as on the edge as I used to be."" A kind owner would put Triumph out of its misery."
4,True Triumph fans only,"Those other reviews are great. FOR ME TO POOP ON!This CD contains the material that you wouldn't be able to see on TV due to its content. Funny stuff with Jack Black as well as Conan. If you are a TRUE Triumph fan and not someone who has just seen him on Conan and thought he was funny because of his ""poop on"" jokes, than you'll enjoy this.The other reviews boggle the mind. ""Insulting and vulgar""? Uh, hello... his name is Triumph the Comic INSULT dog, what do you expect?The songs are great. The only downside to the CD is some of the skits drag out a little too long. 4 stars for Triumph!"
1,Disgusting and should be pulled from all shelves at stores,"Wow, what a horrible disgrace to the music world. I saw some of this previewed on Jay Leno and I was grossed out at the content of this cd and the videos that are included in it.On top of that, they are using this Mutt as an ad campaign for PETA to insult a highly respected person in the music industry.I hope that all the stores will pull this crap off of their shelves and ask for refunds from the company."
1,Triumph,"I was looking forward to this cd/dvd because I always thought Triumph was hilarious on Conan. Wow, was I disappointed. I truly wish I had saved my money on this drivel."
1,It really is poop!,"This is pre-teen potty humor. There are moments of comic intelligence, but they are too few to really be a good comedy cd. I really like the character, but this CD is just awful, compared to what I was expecting. Please Save Your Money!"
1,Really stupid...,"What a disappointment! Based on reviews, it sounded like it would be funny in the tradition of Alan Sherman. Instead, it is just dumb, and could be offensive to animal lovers."
1,"Don't be stupid, too","Although this cd has its moments, overall it should stay on the shelf. Get a laugh and then walk out of the room for 10 minutes before coming back for one more laugh. Poop on this one and save your money."
1,Poop for sale!,"I feel like what they are trying to accomplish with this record is to convince people that poop smell good. Sorry, only idiots who have a low taste for comedy would be convinced."
1,Insulting and not funny,"Triumph is an example of our country ""going to the dogs"". He insults everything good and embraces everthing degrading. I would not recommend this CD to anyone. Our children are being exposed to too much of this type of derrogatory entertaimnent. I bought this CD thinking it would make me laugh, instead it just disgusted me. I do not laugh at someone elses expense. I will not sell this CD. I will throw it away!"
2,Dont waste your money,"First off, to the child who posted, this CD is meant for 18 and older, as it features adult material.Anyways, i bought this CD awhile back because i liked his song 'i kee'd'....Well... thats the only track on the cd that really has ANY listenable Qualitys.... the rest is just random curse words thrown out to try to offend people. Had he used the words in a witty way, it would be ok...but he doesnt...Most of it is not funny at all."
1,Comic disaster!,"The title of this CD speakes for itself. The guy behind this dog puppet must be a very dirty, disgusting person. I feel unclean after listening to this."
1,not funny,I love Conan and I always look forward to seeing Triumph on his show. So I was very excited about this CD. But it is just not funny. It is just one very long and painful joke about dog sex and dog poop. Please do not buy this CD.
3,"Has its moments, but overall tries too hard","I admit to being a Triumph fan. His work on ""Late Night with Conan O'Brien"" and guest shots on ""Hollywood Squares"" are great. I finally bought this album last summer, almost two years after its release, and although some tracks brought laughs, the wanna-be edginess made this disappointing. I got laughs from ""Who"", ""Benji's Queer"", ""Cats are C**ts"", ""Together in Pooping"" and ""I Keed"". I have no problem with lowbrow humor, but, some songs are just vulgar for the sake of being vulgar, such as ""No Rules in the Animal Kingdom"", ""You Had to Work Blue"", and the tribute to his mom. I can honestly say that there were parts of those three songs where I actually cringed at some of the stuff he said, and I don't get easily offended. Triumph is funny on TV, when his dialogue is somewhat limited, but in an uncensored environment, he tries way too hard to be offensive."
5,THE BEST POOP IVE EVER HEARD I DONT KEED,"this is by far some of the best poop triumph has ever laid, its funny witty shocking and downright hilarious. anybody that doesnt agree should be pooped on, no no i keed i keed. i think anyone that likes to laugh has to hear TRIUMPH he is THE KING OF POOP NO KEEDING!!!"
1,Zero Stars would be more like it.,"Avoid this album if you like comedy. Sorry I listened to it. Every now and then I'd laugh a little and then get a sick feeling in my stomach . . . you know what I mean? Like ""How could I laugh at that"". The album totally turned me off. And, I'm not a prude, I can enjoy a dirty joke along with the best of them, but this stuff stinks of ""Poop"". Good title, come to think of it."
1,It sure ain't a 5 star CD,"Who the hell is giving this 5 stars. Five stars it given to nonnegotiable artists, artists who everyone respects whether you like their music or not. 2 Pac, the Beatles, Pink Floyd, Elvis, Buddy Holley, Eminem even. But a CD entitled ""Come POOP with me"" tells you right off it sucks. You will never see a title with the word poop in it in a mucisal history book."
1,its just not funny... unless you are 8-10 years old,"save your money. go to ebaumsworld, go to the arnold swarzeneggar soundboard, call up your nearest panty store and you will laugh your ass off. buy this cd and you are dissapointed the whole way through. you want to laugh, and keep waiting for the funny stuff to come up but it never does! so eventually you are the one getting pooped on, and you lost your time and money."
1,"Pure Poop, for sure","Sorry, but as an animal lover this CD is painful. As a lover of comedy it gets even worse. If you want dirty comedy, George Carlin is the master. I hope Amazon never puts any clips up, I would hate for a child to hear any of this."
1,Stupid and Disgusting!.,"Honestly, this garbage should be banned from any stores. I can't believe they sell this kind of things in Amazon.com. It is an insult to customers!"
1,Was a big fan,"Triumph's romps with Bon Jovi, Star Wars fans, and dog shows are among the finest comedic pieces ever created. I held Triumph in high regard as a witty, intelligent character who never ceased to make me laugh. This album changed everything. Once Smigel gained freedom from the censors, he no longer put any effort into wit, and instead replaced it with profanity, hoping that the profanity, in and of itself, would make people laugh. I listened to this album with 6 other people, all of whom love South Park, Tarantino movies, etc., so the profanity is not an issue. We all sat in dead silence the majority of the time. It was painful and very disappointing. What a letdown. All wit was gone. The DVD is even worse. The bits with guests, especially the Dell guy, are excruciating to watch. We fast-forwarded the Horatio Sanz bit. If you really like Triumph, please do not buy this album if you want to remain a fan."
5,GOOD DOG!,"You either get it or don't, I guess. Can't understand the 3 star average. I read a great review in an old Entertainment Weekly and found the CD at Virgin. Every song works, some are downright classics (I want to see a video for Together in Pooping). Jack Black rocks hard in studio and live DVD versions of the hilarious Bob Barker. Conan's cameo is priceless as well.The crank yanker style calls are great because the people don't understand they're talking to a dog. It's amazing how long some of them go without ever getting it. The poor nurse at the STD clinic is totally stumped and weirded out.It's a little pricey but a bargain when you throw in the DVD, which features some of the best songs on the CD and some very funny battles with Kurt Loder and Big pussy. Triumph really mixes it up with the celebs in a way we don't see on the Conan show. When he zeroes in on Jaed and the drunk Dell Guy, it's Triumph Zen for sure."
3,15 Minutes Of Nostalgia,"I'm late for just about anything in popular culture, but I did follow Triumph pretty close to when he was ""hot"" by watching TV Funhouse and I saw him rip John Kerry when he was running in 2004, that was really good. The CD and DVD for the used price is worth it, the songs are silly and will get old fast but it is nostalgic. I was let down watching the DVD and now I know why Triumph is not around too much now. He can't ad lib all that good. I mean if you ever watched Don Rickles you know what an insult comic should be like. Triumph when he did TV shows can do that because the bad poop gets edited out, but on that DVD where he is live, he's pretty weak. Oh well, it was cool while it lasted and worth it for the low used price. Hell, it might be worth something someday, like a big steamy pile of poop!"
2,Dissapointed,"I bought 4 of these for Christmas presents... okay, I kept one for myself. Overall, I was extremely dissapointed. The songs on the CD were pretty funny, but I really think Triumph's gag is better with visuals so I was looking forward to the DVD. Maybe my expectations were too high but the DVD was just horrible. It just wasn't up to the par that he sets on shows like Conan OBrien or Hollywood Squares. If someone would put together a DVD of those moments (the Westminster Dog Show segment comes to mind), it would be an instant top seller I think. My advice is... don't buy this."
1,AND THEY CALL THIS HUMOR?,To think that this is the CD that Conan OBrien was bragging about one night on his talk show. Makes you wonder whats happened to him since he is suppose to be such a comic genius.What crap.
1,Can I give it a minus five stars????,"Sorry, doesn't even come close to being acceptable as a credible piece of good humor. Save your money. I would never allow my family to listen to this very distasteful cd."
1,The best cd to poop on!,How can amazon.com decide to sell this garbage? It is just the worst thing to buy but the best thing to poop on!
2,Painfully unfunny,"This album is not worth the price. Listen to it once on Napster premium if you have to. It's on there and you'll save money.There are about five tracks worth listening to once or twice, but you'll get sick of the album in less than a day.Most of the CD are unfunny prank calls. Sure funny premise but the results are not funny.Conan's really ruins a potentially funny track called 'Cat's are c***s'. The so-called shock of him saying the C word at the end is not a shock at all. He is the Kathy-Lee Gifford of comedy where his only interest is forcing people to hear him sing. He THINKS he has a decent singing voice. P>The DVD is a rip off too.Yes 'I keed' is funny. Yes, 'You have to Work Blue', 'Benji's gay' and 'Blackwolf' are funny. Listen to complete tracks NOW on napster, but you'll get sick of the album in less than a day. I guarandamntee it.Because there are 20 other tracks that s*ck."
1,what a piece of sh*t,"this is the worst comedy CD ever released! seriously, its so bad i can't even begin to tell you. once i saw that video for that single i knew it was going to be bad. there isn't a single even remotely funny thing in that video or song, its just stupid. the reviewer who called it drop dead hilarious must be a moron or have no standards for humor. anyone who even considers spending money on this should be euthanized. nevermind, if you even make the effort to steal it you should be stoned to death."
1,Triumph Bites the Dust,Triumph is immature and ignorant. Buy Measure of a Man by Clay Aiken (the god of pop!) instead......
1,Strangest book ever,This has to be one of the most poorly written books ever published. Pages and pages of random words and phrases.There's no plot. Time and location change from sentence to sentence without warning. I had to force myself to keep reading and even then I didn't know what the book was about.The author seemes to make up words and describe the same thing over and over.Don't waste your time or money on this one.
5,Excellent choice,Excellent book does not miss much where wood bending is concerned. He covers every aspect of the process. I would strongly recommend it.
5,book,"This product is going to help me enjoy my hobby much more, now that I have the time to use it ."
2,wrong one,this movie is ok but they put the wrong one on dvd. the one they should put on dvd is sweet hostage.that is in my top five favorite movie list.there was no tv movie that is better than sweet hostage.if you like to sit down and watch a good good sad movie than sweet hostage is for you. NOT THIS ONE.
2,Fast forward review,"You can always tell when the lolita sleaze crowd holds a flick in high esteem, but no matter how rotten or forgotten, the price never hits the cutout bin level, just look!OK, we got the famous broomstick scene, but actually there are two better, one where LB gets checked out for lice or whatever, and one later on where she starts to undress for a shower. The broomstick scene has its moments, but LB is an icon due to her innocent facial expressions framed by all that early teen hair, and she spends too much time in the 'stick scene lying on the floor protecting her chest from the camera, and her hair's all wet.The producers knew exactly what they were doing, even down to the title. If it been a theatre release they would have sold out on raincoats. Two solid stars, in spite of no nudity, a first. I won't even deduct for the mistake with the bathing suit strap in the broomstick scene. What, you don't think she actually did this nude do you? Sorry, just edit it out."
4,"A Runaway's Dilemma, Born Innocent-Amazon","While serving time in the U.S. Navy and having read the paperback, ""The Exorcist"" and seeing the movies, one of my favorite actresses included Linda Blair who is the star of ""Born Innocent."" I had never seen this made for TV movie before and wonder who may have actually seen it then. The movie causes one to think about relationships and why a runaway thinks anything is better than going back home when one of her parents won't give her a chance to straighten up and fly right."
3,born innocent,"i forgot how disturding this film was back in the day, i love linda blair. but its very sad story will not watch again"
5,A thoroughly good book,I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I read alot of books and most of them I usually put down and dont go back to for a long time or it takes me a long time to read them. This book I really couldnt put it down I was anxiously awaiting for what was going to happen next. I look forward to another book from her I trully enjoyed her style of writing.
4,Changing old thinking is painful!,"I resisted many of the ideas in this book when I first read them. (""I'm a good guy! How could my life be harmful to Indians?!"") I kept at it, figuring if I reacted so strongly, it must have been hitting close to home!While Mander is sometimes pretty heavy-handed with his arguments, he challenges a lot of assumptions in a straight-forward, deliberate, compelling way that ultimately led me to make some concrete changes in my life. Can't promise that for everyone-- but if you've a gut feeling that says the way we live as a country is a little nuts, this book may help confirm your suspicions. It also manages to offer a few solutions."
3,Elite Folding Rocking Patio Chair - Midnight Blue,"Good construction, comfortable... Only drawback is eventual squeakiness in the joints--bring on the wd/40--and once the chair is ""locked"" you may need a tool to refold it. Would still recommend though, good chair."
3,Rocking Chair,Chair is not that easy to carry and could be made to be more comfortable. Prime Products 13-6501 Elite Foling Rocker.
4,very comfortable!,"I wish I could find a rocker this comfortable for my livingroom! I'd take a chair like this over my too-big rocker/recliner anyday. This chair is comfortable to sit and has a broad, smooth rocker motion. I really like to swing back and forth when I sit in a rocking chair. This chair makes that possible. I ordered one and then immediately ordered a second! I highly recommend this chair. My only complaints (resulting in 4 instead of 5 stars) are that the bright blue chair pictured became a navy blue chair delivered; and the delivery fee was more than half the price of the chair."
3,"blue in the face, not in the chair","the box showed up at my door beat up w/ a big gaping hole on one of its side. the ups man must have gotten hungry along the way. there was no inner packaging to protect the chair, but i guess it's part plastic, part metal, part cloth... so why add the extra expense, right? there was some minor scuffs and scratches, but noting major to complain about. the only big issue for me was that the PHOTO represented on Amazon was a lighter, more brilliant blue. What i received was the opposite end of the blue spectrum. I guess i should paid more attention to the description instead of buying something base on looks alone. all and all, the chair works for my it's intended purpose...."
2,Not a happy camper,"Rocker was purchased for use camping. It was difficult to open and close, resulting in pinched fingers. The cap on the rocker frame wouldn't stay on. Although it did rock once opened,it was stiff and squeaky while rocking. That, and the difficulty in opening and closing, made its frequent use unlikely. I returned it."
2,Not What I Expected,"I returned this item because the color was much darker than pictured and did not match my other furniture. Also, it was not worth the price. I was expecting something much sturdier for the price."
1,piece of junk,had for 3 months of occasional use and both arms are broken. i would like to know how to get my money back?
4,Folding Rocker does the job,"I bought this rocker for when we travel to the beach. My 3 month old needs a lot of rocking. This chair was a lifesaver.Some cons...I truly wished the back was higher, so I could rest my head. Also, there needs to be a latch to hold it closed when folded up and not in use. It's also very difficult to close up one-handed (holding a baby). Also, I read comments about it being great for large people. I'm average size, so it was perfect. I just don't see it working well for really wide people.All said it was what we needed to survive a weekend with our fussy baby."
4,Not the color in picure,"These chairs are not the blue color as in the picture. They are very dark navy. And there is no blue on the arms, they are a dark gray frame. They are made very well and are very comfortable but they are not the color they look like in the picture."
2,Plastic Breaks,The plastic arm broke after occasional use.The plastic position lock feature broke after occasional use.The plastic position lock is difficult to unlock.
5,Pure Kiwi gold,"As a Aussie kid growing up in OZ in the 70's and 80's Mi-Sex was one band I always loved. I own both these gems on vinyl and have Graffiti Crimes on CD, as it was known as here, but not Space Race which is why I purchased this disc. Firstly let me start by saying that a few of the songs on Computer Games are slightly different than the versions on the Aussie release which is cool 'cause now I got both.As a whole both these albums are classic 80's new wave pop with full on keys and synths and some gritty guitar thrown in for good measure and vocally awesome from Steve Gilpin (R.I.P). Along with Dragon these guys are the best to ever come out of New Zealand and sadly both singers are dead and will never be the same again but hey, that's life, they left some great albums for us to enjoy. Hopefully soon the other 2 classics Shanghaied and Where Do They Go will make it onto CD format.As the great Molly Meldrum used to say... ""Do yourself a favor and buy this"""
2,Mi-Sex album compilation,"Some dubious mastering on this CD. The sound is very thin, could be software compression, and on some tracks (Blue Day in particular) the mix seems to be a mono sum of one stereo track because some key instruments and licks are very faint or missing entirely. Most likely because they were panned to one track of the original stereo mix - the track missing off this master!The whole CD sounds like a bunch of highly and poorly compressed mp3's but better than nothing if you can't find a genuine master."
2,I didn't expect mush,And I didn't get much. Inexpensive for the number of discs. Out of the 10 DVD'S about half of one of them was worth watching. The majority of these 10 discs look like a high school lecture or maybe a cult symposium.
4,Writer is very talented. Recommended reading.,"This work is worth reading as the writer shows imagination, ingenuity, and an ability to use the written word to create an image."
5,This book brought back my Grandmother.,"Mr. Ward's portrayal of his grandmother was extremely vivid. It brought back a whole flood of emotions that I had not felt in many years. I, too, had a Grandmother that exuded the subtle power of his. I feel that this book was a gem of which more people should be made aware. A very interesting and compelling story."
5,Great book!,Becky's cute characters come to life with her attention to every little detail. All the characters are fairly simple and are just adorable. Great book for a beginner or even the most advanced! Loved it!
4,A good starter book,"I had already been working with polymer clay a little bit, but couldn't find ANYWHERE any books detailing how to create those cute little people figures. This book covers that (albeit in a very basic way) and many more styles as well. Recommended for those just starting out in clay and well worth the money."
2,tammy wynette book,"I got this product and it wasn't in the shape that was posted. It was used but said was in great shape, it wasn't. It was yellowed and the jacket was torn."
4,A clearcut case against the Efficient Market Hypothesis,"Haugen takes it best shot against the Efficient Markets hypothesis. He states his case with analytical precision, wit and a good sense of humour. Probably, he exaggerates the novelty of his critics: whoever is updated on finance theory and practice already knows what Haugen has to say. Anyway, it is worth reading it."
3,Good but unexciting,"Technically a good cd, which I really bought for the great sound reviews it has. Sonically terrific, musically a little unexciting, but most enjoyable."
5,"The best for ""light"" mud","If you use light mud, not the all purpose, this is the grit for you! I use it all the time, and I do drywall for a living."
4,dont listen to that other guy!,"just wanted to tell anyone who's interested in this fine cd that it is by no means a hardcore cd, it is a nice noise mix/singles cd! wouldnt it be obvious from the fact that its on VC and looking at the tracks on the list? =0)"
5,Great recording,"Absolutely wonderful ensemble playing by an outstanding group and conductor. I can't listen to this disc enough, especially Trittico which according to my resources, was recorded in 1 take. Make sure you have a good sound system to get the full power and depth"
5,"educatonal insights, friendly and helpful","I am a preschool teacher and use this stamp to put the letter we learn each day on the students hand before they leave, This way they see it for the rest of the day and reinforce what we have learned. They love to smell their hand, and look forward to a new scent each day. I had a few questions about the product and the Educational Insights staff answered my questions in a friendly quick manner. They were so helpful that in the future, when, I need any teaching supplies I will look to their inventory first!"
2,very faint smell,"I got this ink pad for the smell, my child loves the smelly stamp. Though smell is sweet and fun, I can barely smell it and didn't last long. I will not buy this product series again."
3,Red Apple Scent stamp pad,The smell was not as strong as I thought it was going to be. Used it for a card wanted to smell like apple. i added apple scent liquid I had to inkpad. It was better but probably wouldn't buy again.
2,Underwhelming,"Apart from concerns regarding the recording balance, here are my two cents: When I saw the program I thought this was going to leave my spine vibrating for a long time; blockbusters such as 'The Promise of Living', 'Simple Gifts', and 'Make Our Garden Grow' should. But didn't. I pressume the directorial conception indicated control. For those who want all stops pulled, then, this was dissapointing."
2,Average,Tracks 6 & 7 are the only worthwhile songs. The rest rely too heavily on 1970's children's records for the base sample track. This gets tiring after the third listening.
5,Thought provoking... a great film!,"As someone of partial Native American ancestry I felt this movie did an excellent job of presenting in a short period of time the past atrocities committed and the continuing impact on indigenous communities today in many parts of the world. It was compelling to see the change in mindset of this intelligent group of filmakers and to see them defend the indigenous community to their government even though they were afraid to do so. It was a though provoking, emotional film that carries the message that it is time for all of us to wake up and see what is happening in our world today."
4,Excellent Overall Lens,"The Tamron 18-200 is an excellent overall lens that will be more than adequate for all but the most demanding professionals. It takes beautiful images throughout its zoom range and focuses reasonably fast, nothing superior, but does do a good job. Also, this lens can take some spectacular close-up shots as well. It's no dedicated macro, but it is just an additional bonus to this already fine fens.The primary complaints I have for this lens is it is ""light hungry"". In order for it to really shine, give it a lot of light to work with. F3.5 at 18mm is not very fast and it only gets slower. Understand this when you use the lens, give it what it needs and be realistic with what you are paying for, and this lens will not let you down."
4,for the price u can't go wrong.,product was shipped & arrived quickly. for the price this is a great product. for the price i paid for it & the results i'm getting there's no way i can complain about this lens. would purchase from this seller again.
4,Tamron 18-200 Di II Zoom lens,"Having used Tamron zoom on my Nikon N80 , I was already familiar with brand and features. Macro is very useful. A really good lens, especially if you don't like carrying around a whole bag of lenses ! Very versatile."
3,Nice lens but SHORT on zoom range,"I bought this to go with my Nikon D50. While being a nice feeling lens with a good solid quality feel, I too noticed the zoom range to be far short of the rated 28-300 when used with a digital SLR. My informal tests compared against a Nikkor 70-210 on my older N70 shows the zoom range of the Tamron to be approximately the same as my Nikkor. This is also proven to be true when comparing the zoom range against my Sony DSC-H1. At the 300mm range this lens is only 200mm, plus or minus.I am happy with the quality, feel, and convenience of this lens, but did not find this out until after the return period had expired. Based on the true range, I would have prefered to buy the Nikkor 55-200 and be done with it for about half the price............Tamron has ripped us off with their lies. I have read other reviewers offering the same conclusions.If you can buy an OEM lens in the 200mm range for the same money DO IT........you will not regret your purchase."
3,alright but not great,Doesn't project as powerful of a signal as I'd hoped. Plus there's no AC adapter option that I could find so you're always using batteries if you're not using it in the car (for which there's a cig lighter adapter). I find myself having to change stations a lot because of static.
5,Fabulous little toy,This gadget is great for getting music through the car--especially where there is little radio traffic; like here in Antarctica!
1,Didn't work,Not sure what the problem is but I've tried every frequency available and there is still static. Unusable.
4,review...,The transmitter works very well and is more durable than others I've had in the past. It gets a touch of static if the car antenna is at the back of a car instead of in front where it's closer to the transmitter. It's really only noticeable to me during breaks between songs.
5,PHENOMENAL!!,"This release by Mike Garson is phenomenal! The sound quality by this Reference Recordings' HDCD is just as phenomenal! The players are all top notch and the tunes included range from beautifully interpretive piano solos by Garson to some of the hardest driving jazz you will hear from a small jazz ensemble. The talent from Reference Recordings and this Garson group is unsurpassed.If you are a jazz lover (and even if you are not), you will be thrilled by both the playing and sound quality on this CD. And, if you have a CD player with an HDCD decoder, beware. . . someone will have to peel that ""permanent"" smile from your face. This recording is THAT GOOD!!"
1,not worth it,the outfit was an x-small and it was big on my 6 pound maltese i also had to take off right away cause there was feathers every where.
5,Great value for a 5-pack of 400 film!,"Kodak makes great film, and 400 speed is the only way to go. You may thikn this is overkill, but consider that if you are taking pictures of kids, you need a slightly faster speed than 100 or 200 so your photos do not get blurred. With nearly all cameras these days, you can always adjust your speed down (so if you have 400 film in the camera, you can set it for 100).THe actual picture quality is very good, with grain structure great and holding well up if you blow it up to an 8""x10"" print.Best part about this film is the price... you just cant find this price in Wal-Mart"
4,film,the film is what I've always used and it's terrific. Only there is no expiration date on most of them and that is what I would have really liked to have.
5,Good standard,"I buy this film for SLR photography, which I do as a hobby only. The 400 ISO speed is a good compromise in usability, since at least one of my film cameras (Olympus OM-10) does not have a flash. C-41 process film like this is the easiest to get developed at any local photo store or pharmacy chain. Serious photographers will probably want to shoot slide film for more accurate/reproducible prints. Note that I purchased through Mel Pierce Camera and the film has at least 10 months left before expiration."
2,Film delivered not as pictured. No pun intended.,"The film was delivered promptly, however, the film was not sold as pictured in the box and no way to tell how old the film was. I have developed 3 of the rolls with poor results. I am going to possibly take my remaining two rolls to another developer, but I am not holding my breath. I will not be ordering from Amazon for this product again."
3,No box no expiration date,I received 5 rolls of film with no box and no expiration date. I was assuming it would be as pictured. I'm not sure how fresh the film is but I'll know after I use it.
3,It's 35mm film!,"Well, this film works like 35mm film should and was bought for art projects, so I have no complaints except about the cost of developing them! :)"
1,Quantity Unknown,"As a comparison shopper, all of the information is not available. How many pictures are on each of the 5 rolls?"
4,"Deep, resonant beauty","This release from Robin Storey (Zoviet France) is full of deep, reverberated atmospheres. The music is thick and dense but never too dark. The result is a soothing nighttime mantra. Beautiful!"
5,Best belt for the money!!!,"As always, Amazon has extremely fast shipping and excellent customer service. I have always used Gatorback belts because they last a lifetime. It's worth the little extra to pay for them to have piece of mind. This belt went on a 2001 Jeep Grand Cherokee Lerado,4.7,w/ AC without any problems."
5,OUTSTANDING!!!!! WOW!,The book has been very well reviewed by others. I only wanted to add that this was an outstanding read! It will stay on my bookshelf for reading again in the future. It has all the elements in it that make it a great story. I highly recommend it! You won't be dissapointed! Be sure to set aside some time because you won't want to put it down!
1,Not passion but rage,"Was colter meant to be bipolar? It was too aggravating to enjoy. I love this authors other books, but this one was a huge letdown."
2,The devil is in the details.,"The package arrived with ZERO assembly instructions. Intuition alone got the stilts assembled. The hardware is sub-par; several of the lock-nuts had stripped threads and it took an extra visit to the hardware store to replace them.If I got to choose again, I'd buy Dura-stilts instead."
3,The Cuts can cut it,"I also saw these guys live opening for the Black Keys, and I think they were actually pretty good. While they only played a couple of tracks, they were very rythymic and powerful, with energy flowing from the whole band. That's what you get with garage rock and definitely what The Cuts are all about. A couple of songs are a bit slow for me, you know bands believe in having an obligatory couple of slow ballad tracks as well, but if you excell in power punk pop, why not just keep at it right? Overall good stuff, they definitely have potential, I recommend you check them out.But to the reviewer that said they sucked and that no one cheered for them, is a bit of a surprise. It's hard to imagine they have any taste over there then, whereas over here, in the midwest we loved them and wished their set was longer. To each their own I guess."
2,maybe the cd is better,i saw them live with the black keys last night and they were pretty bad. ill give them stage presence for having a mix of two fat and 2 skinny dudes rockin out but they just were not that good of a rock band. they tried to overdue their sound. they were having fun playin but everyone in the crowd couldnt wait for it to be over.
1,"THE CUTS, CUT INTO MY STOMACH AND MAKE ME HURL","One WORD SUCK.This bad is horrible I saw them the other night open for the black keys. Almost no one in the audience clapped for them its like listening to a really bad version of T-REX meets every horrible rock cliche. The lead singer is downright scary, he thinks he is a rock star with the way he goes on. He asked the audience you want more? All I heard was the No being chanted.If you get really really lucky the horrendous keyboard player will attempt to sing and do the worse humble pie/ 70's soft balled song. This should almost bring about a bowel movement in anyone who hears it. The cuts made me want to stop hearing music for the night, if someone gave me this cd I would chuck it asap."
3,So-so performance from an (relatively) expensive lens,"I've been playing with this lens attached to my EOS 400D for couple of weeks now and I'm affraid it's not living up to my expectations, or it's relatively high price. Out of all the third party contenders (Tamron, Sigma & Tokina), this one is the most expensive, about $100 more than Tokina, yet it has the most limited zoom range, but most importantly, it's way too soft. Maybe I just have a bad copy, but in that case, for the price the QC should be better. At 18mm, it's marginally better than the 18-55 Canon kit lens, but then again, I don't need it for 18mm. Color rendition is OK and with some post-processing it makes acceptable 8x10 prints, but I just can't get over the price difference, so I'm returning it and trying my luck with Tokina 12-24..."
1,Horrible!!!,"These are just awful!!! Horrible quality. Where do I even start??? Some of the individual tiles are broken, others are alltogether missing... the edges of the coasters (which are just glass squares with tile and grout on top) are sharp enough to cut your skin... Alot of the grout chipped off the glass and is missing, so you just see bare glass... I could have done a better job myself if I had the time. These are just useless! I dont think anyone would even pay a dollar for these at a yard sale so I better hurry and return them!!!"
2,"I like them, but they chip and are rather fragile","After removing the coasters from the packaging and placing them on our coffee table, we noticed that the paint from one of the corners on one of the coasters was cracked and soon enough the paint chipped off, revealing the glass underlayer. Other coasters began chipping as well through casual use. We were going to return them since the coasters were chipping at an exponential rate after a couple days, but the price was so low that it would be counter intuitive to pay for shipping to return them. We'll have to eventually just purchase new coasters."
2,Broken coasters,"When the package containing my coasters got to my house, I found them in terrible condition. The grout holding the tiles together was already deteriorating. There were broken pieces scattered in the box. Even now as I use them, the grout is continuing to fall off. They are pretty, but also pretty cheap."
2,"In-depth, Tiresome, Tedious and Dull","Book probably makes a good point, but it is extremely dry and hard to read (yes even for a history novel). The author constantly jumps between different time periods and throws names and facts at the reader without really ever explaining in depth of what they are. As in example, the term singory is used throughout the book yet Martines never explains what it actually is. The author makes the assumption that as a reader you are an absolute expert on this time period. If you are an expert, this book will probably read like poetry to you. However, if you lack a complete understanding, this book will be a tiresome and dull read with farm to unknown and unexplained facts, terms, and names mixed together. Would not recommend to anyone remotely interested in renaissance history."
4,Great kids Catholic Bible!,We have just started using this Bible in our PSR class and it appears that it is going to be a great way to help the kids learn more about their Catholic faith.
3,A good Idea that needs refinement,"The Goldblatt Drywall Stripper has the right idea,however; it is difficult to adjust and does an incomplete job in cutting.When adjusted tightly,it snags the paper of the drywall and when to loose,provides only a line for cutting with a knife. The cutting wheels are light weight and are easily bent when adjusting the width or when accidently dropped. Refinement in the adjustment features and heavier cutting wheels would greatly improve the usefulness of this product."
1,drywall stripper,"I bought this item with the idea of saving time it worked great until I dropped it, which was about three hours into the day, the cheaply made star wheels that score the paper bent over now as you can imagine it leaves a wavy line instead of a nice straight one, I am very disapointed with the quality of this product and would not buy another one"
4,nice Album,A lot of good christmas songs my favorite two is Kirk franklin and family and Whitney Houston I listed to them all day.
5,smmooth sounds,I like the artists on this CD. It's a wonderful Christmas CD to enjoy all day long. I never got tired of hearing it play continuously. You will not be disappointed if you buy this CD. Everyone in my family enjoyed this at home and in the car.
3,"Jingle bells, Batman smells.","This compilation features R&B Christmas songs recorded between 1985 and 2000. Contemporary R&B isn't really my bag, but this isn't bad. Run-D.M.C.'s ""Christmas in Hollis"" is a classic, of course. Dru Hill does a very good version of ""This Christmas"". Whitney Houston's version of ""Do You Hear What I Hear?"" is quite good. And Take 6 does a great a cappella rendition of ""Oh Little Town of Bethlehem"". The other songs are ok, but the ones I mentioned are my favorites. If you enjoy modern R&B, you will probably like this CD a lot."
4,Pretty Good,"Pretty good concert recording, from Peterborough, England, early '80's. 1973 composition Bio is a treat, and Maybelline works well attached to Mountain Dew. Daughter Ingrid Berry sings Highway and Mojo. The crowd sometimes sings along, and Chuck plays some very hot solos."
1,Hardware Store Pipe with Orange Paint,"Go to the hardware store and buy some black pipe of the appropriate size, buy a coupler, then buy some orange paint. Presto, you have this product exactly. Calculate the difference and send me the money.In other words, don't waste your money on this. It is just a piece of pipe."
5,Lounge beat,"I was sitting in a café in Switzerland when I first heard ""Easy Beats"". I found it so relaxing and nice that I had to ask the waiter for the name of the album. I am so glad I did because it is a really cool album, great when you have friends over and want to create a cosy atmosphere. Great buy!"
5,Key largo,"I bought this CD for the song Key Largo,one of my favorites but have enjoyed all the songs- very good."
3,Key Largo escape,"Very unique cd, takes you away when you need to escapethe everyday. I love the song Key Largo, which is whyI bought the Cd, but enjoyed the whole Cd."
5,Loads Of Fun,"Bertie Higgins strikes the mark more aptly than any of his better known contemporaries with words, melody, rhythm and mood on this exceptional album from Sony, KEY LARGO. Here the Caribbean comes to life--not in a ""native islander"" setting, but more in an ""American vacationer"" groove. Great rhythms for working out on the treadmill, too--or backstroking to the beat of your waterproof MP3. Sony Music, 39 minutes.QUESTION: Which great Caribbean folk singer has the same initials as Bertie Higgins?HINT: The initials are reversed.ANSWER: Harry Belafonte. (Sorry I couldn't put the answer upside down, but I'm still using one of these old fashioned computers)."
4,Terrific photo selection from the early days...,"Anyone interested in the history of surfing will be thrilled to look at this assortment of great shots. All are sepia toned, and don't expect crisp, high resolution reproductions here. What counts is the subject matter, and that's all here in spades. We got the Duke, Tom Blake, interestng beach goings-on at San Onofre circa the '40's, Billy Hamilton, Greg Noll and others. The price is a little stiff, but all are suitable for framing and, looking at it that way, what you are really purchasing is art. If you like surfing, you'll get a kick out of these."
2,Poor quality,"Worst-quality ""text book"" I've ever read and, with six years of higher education, I've read a lot of text books. There are multiple typos, grammatical errors, and mis-spelled words. Even worse, a lot of the text doesn't make any sense. A subsequent paragraph often contradicts its predecessor, for example. I'm going to call Dearborn's ""help line"" with all of the questions/clarifications that I've marked throughout this book. It will probably take an hour to get through all of them. The only good thing I have to say about it is that it's organized well. Overall, I do not recommend Dearborn's publications."
2,Boring (Sorry),"This book seemed great at first, but good grief, there were so many people involved in the beginning and none were very interesting. I certainly didn't want dialogue from these characters. I'm referring mainly to the ones on Crusade. I wanted to get to know the wonderful, handsome Garren, but he was overshadowed too early on for me to care one way or the other what he ended up doing."
1,Didn't hold my interest,"I did like this book - right up until the people traveling with Sir Garren left the church and embarked on their journey. The story just went south from there. Sir Garren had SUCH potential, too."
2,Did its job for 3 years then just wore out -- too expensive for short life span,"I used this lock heavily over three years. In that time I experience one minor and one major issue. The minor issue is that the mounting system is terrible. It just can't hold up to the shock of carrying a heavy lock on a hard tail bike. The major issue is that the lock failed to open reliably after three years of use. I tried all three provided keys under the assumption my key was becoming worn. I was mistaken. After 5 minutes of jiggling the key I always use, I was able to get the lock off one final time before permanent retirement. For the cost I would expect a longer lasting system."
3,"Could be better, Kryptonite.","This is the best size lock for this style of locking: remove front wheel, lock together with back wheel to post/rack.The key is hard to use: have to push it in all the way. Sometimes it jams, requires fiddling.The mounting bracket is absurd. It takes a good amount of force to remove it, which causes the lock to finally shoot out quickly. After smashing my knuckles a few times, I figured out to push the lock from underneath. Awkward. Not a good design!"
4,First thoughts,"I've yet to have anyone seriously try to break this lock, so I can't give it a five-star rating until it holds up to that.The bracket was terrible -- I choose to keep mine in the top pocket of my Topeak bag. It fits perfectly there; I can't imagine that a bracket would be better.If you use saddlebags, I'd recommend this lock."
1,Worst mouning system EVER,"How good is this lock? I don't know, but I do know that I'm very likely to forget it because I can't mount it on my bike. Every u-lock I've ever had before went on my bike by just slipping the lock into a bracket and pushing a lever. This one has a cheap, cheap, cheap plastic mounting system that straps on (and undoubtedly UNstraps easily. It wouldn't fit on my new bike because a) the top bar is too thick, b) the brake cable goes under instead of on top of the bar, c) I couldn't mount it on the front bar because of the gear cables d) and it wouldn't fit ANYWHERE because the mounting system keeps it too far away from ANY bar and you have to have a LOT of room above it to be able to snap it on and off. FORGET about leaving your water bottle holder on. It won't even fit with it off. I guess it's not as bad as making a lock that can be opeed with a Bic pen, but COME ON guys!"
1,Be careful,"These are good films, but be careful what you order. The company has made 2 different DVD's under this title, one for small groups and one for individuals to just watch. The individual one is only about 10 min. long and it has no study questions to go with it. This was a total waste of my money!"
4,Instant Favorite!,"As a musician I really appreciate different genre's takes on Christmas classics. This Cd with it's Texas Blues/New Orleans/Mexican/Rock sound is a great Cd and a must have for any music fan's collection. I love all of the tracks, speaking of which the listed track here on Amazon are incorrect. The copy I have has 10 Tracks and are in the order listed below(Found this out while ripping the tracks to my computer for use on my MP3 player):1 - Come All Ye Faithful2 - Children Go Where I send Thee3 - Joy To The World4 - God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen5 - Go Tell It On The Mountain6 - The Virgin Mary Had a Baby Boy7 - Up On The Housetop8 - O Holy Night9 - I Wonder as I Wander10 - What Child Is ThisTrack 2 is my favorite of the tracks but all are very good.I hope this helps you!Mele Kalikimaka from Kaua'i!"
4,A little different,"I heard this on NPR (WETA, Washington DC). It was unusual, and enticing. I want to hear it again, and again. The music is nice, and the ambience it engenders is enthralling"
3,The least of CIF,"This is the least of CIF. I'm not a huge fan of lead singer Dustin Edge's new-found ""studio"" voice."
5,stilts,"I have used these stilts for two year's now. They sure make my work easier,it took a little bit to get the hang of walking with them, but now it is second nature. I haven't had any problems with them. I would not hesitate to buy another pair."
4,The voices of ordinary people,"This book consists of short, personal recollections describing the daily life and tribulations of real, mainly rural people who lived through the depression years of the 1930s.It's an unpolished, un-literary collection of voices, with some voices being more credible than others. Some of the stories aren't meant to be taken seriously.If you're interested in the history of the rural midwest, you will find this book extremely interesting. It offers a lot of insight into what people really owned, and what they did from day to day."
3,Average serial,"I have watched many serials and I would rate this as avg. for the genre.If you are a serial fan you will probably enjoy it,if not you will fast foward thru some of it."
3,Rave on,"What I remember most of this group is a concert that I attented in Brussels almost 10 years ago. We were all into the Manchester hype sitting in with bands such as Happy Mondays, Charlatans, Chapterhouse, Primal Scream, and many more. It was a hell of a party. The CD is now what we call in Belgium ' a bit temps-passé ' (i.e. out-of date) but if you want to get up-to-date with the Manchester rave hype, then you need to buy this one."
5,My 8-year-old went crazy over this book,I have been trying to find something new for my 8-year-old son that really grabs him. I found this book by accident and could not be happier. I have found him reading after bed time under his covers to find out what happens next after our nighttime reading ends. He has put all the remaining volumes on his Christmas list.
4,You know it will be a great series.,"This first installment in the Bone series isn't the best of firsts, but you know when you see the artistry and the characters that this is going to be something great. So, read on."
1,Could not get hooked by Bone,"Unfortunately, I was unimpressed by Smith's highly popular graphic novel. My previous 4th graders and middle schoolers (especially the boys) adore this series, so I was willing to give it a go, but I found the humor and storyline unappealing. I forced myself to finish this first book in the series--I was uninterested by the tribulations of three 'bone' characters, cousins who journey into the unknown, become separated, and eventually reunite. But clearly more trouble is headed their way as this first book in the series concluded. But I will not be reading on to find out what that trouble is! I can see why this plot and humor would appeal to middle grade readers, but it just didn't do much for me. Would not recommend this to many readers, except my most reluctant student readers."
1,MIssing pages - was a Christmas gift,"I intended to buy this book new but somehow it came used - it was also missing the first 8 pages, and many of the remaining pages in the front of the book are torn. Now I will have to buy locally a brand new copy of this book so my son can begin reading it today; so that is extra money wasted when I meant to save time by ordering all Christmas books online from Amazon."
4,Awesome Book,"Do you like books that make you laugh? Then read BONE books! In book 1,3 Bone's cousins are ran out of Boneville and meet an old lady named Rose and a woman named Thorn. All of them get lost in the woods while Rose defends her home. What else could go wrong? PLENTY! By Chris"
5,This is a great book for all ages,I bought this for my 9 yr old son and ending up reading it myself. My son finished this book in 1 afternoon. I love the characters and the pictures are fun. I recommend this to anyone
5,Bone is a classic series for all ages,"Jeff Smith is a wonderful writer/artist and spins tales of adventure like no other. His stories are filled with action, humor, love, sorrow and every other emotion while keeping the stories simple and easy to follow.His artwork is wonderful and he draws his characters emotions beautifully. He doesn't bog the series down with unusual or hard to follow camera shifts as is common with many comics these days.I highly recommend any of the books in the Bone series. They are interesting enough for the older readers and fun enough for the little ones. If you are a fan of comics/cartoons at all - or even any type of adventure - give these books a shot. You won't be disappointed!"
2,"A Bleak, Pity Party of an Album","Smile Empty Soul's album sounds exactly like what you would expect from a band with that name. It's a depressed alt rock act taking a cue from Staind by crying on all 14 tracks about foul family life and how much life sucks. This wouldn't be such a fault if the music itself was compelling, however, the band is less intrested in playing rock than crooning sad songs. The result is a second rate run-of-the-mill sound. The songs, while painful and cathartic, are sloppy in their writing and execution. This is only excusable because of their age and inexperience. They still have a way's to go before they should be considered as true rock musicians."
5,awsome cd,"This cd is amazing. Although the entire album is not really like its single, bottom of a bottle, it's still a great cd. If you want to hear all of the songs go to their website http://www.smileemptysoul.com"
2,Pretty bad...but there's hope!,"Smile Empty Soul is not what I would call the greatest band in the world. They sound almost identical to the multitude of other nu-metal bands. Still, they show some promise. They lyrics aren't completely worthless- in fact, they are actually good at some points. Bottom of a Bottle and Nowhere Kids are two excellent songs. After that, the album falls flat on its face. The band attempts to make some ""soft"" ballads-- with horrible results. In fact, after the two aforementioned songs, the rest of the album is pretty forgettable. I think the words of my local radio station put it best: ""These guys peaked with Bottom of a Bottle."""
4,Smile Empty Soul,A CD you put in when you're traveling down the road. The CD opens with two excellent songs (which got much radio play). There are though a few songs which slow the tempo down a touch too much. They have powerful lyrics with a strong message towards broken households filled with strife. A clear message that is worth the buy.
5,MIND BLOWIN',"Oh my god before I heard Smile Empty Soul I had always heard people talking about how kool they were, but you know I thought that they were like a totally hard rock group and I am not in to hard rock, so I never looked them up, untill one day I was talking to my friend Chris and he told me to listen to this song so I did and I was like ""Who was that?"" He goes that was Smile Empty Soul and every since then I have been hooked. I listen to their cd like everyday I never get tired of it. It is by far my favorite cd!"
1,The most painful thing I've ever heard,"Uggh. How can so many people be praising this band? This is literally the worst album I have ever heard. Half the songs seem to be about repeating the chorus at least three times in a row. This is probably to make up for the fact that this band doesn't really have anything worthwhile to say to begin with (much like fellow cookie cutter band Trapt) I'd give this zero stars if I could. Take my advice and avoid this CD like the plague. However if there is somebody in your life that you don't like, I suggest buying them this CD. There's no better punishment then this."
2,lets be honest,seriously people..lets be honest about this band. they sound like every other band you hear on the radio today. everything about this one is average to below average. nothing stands out except their name and we'll all forget that along with their run of the mill attempt at a hard rock release in a few months.
2,"The good, the bad, the ugly...",THE GOOD- Nowhere Kids and Bottom of a Bottle are good songs but dont buy the album just yet. Theres still the bad and ugly.THE BAD- A few songs are bashing on Christianity and im a Christian so i wont stand for that.THE UGLY- Alot of the songs are poorly put together. The sound is awful and the lyrics look like a whiny 5-year-old wrote them.Im so glad i copied this CD instead of wasting 15 of my own money. They should have used the plastic to make this to make a pen so a good band like Demon Hunter can write their lyrics for their new CD.
3,The Potential Is There...,"but the follow-up is lacking. In my opinion, this is an overall good album. ""Bottom Of A Bottle"" is a great track to release as a single and open a cd with. But basically, the whole album switches between upbeat and mellow. Overall, all the even tracks are fast, all odds are slow. Most of the faster ballads are pretty damn good, but some of the slower ones tend to get a little dedious. Such as ""This Is War"" and ""I Want Life"". If you like fast, quasi-hardcore riffs, and slow ballads about someones childhood then this is the CD for you."
2,Boring & Unoriginal...,"C'mon, how many times have we heard this by now? I understand having angst and stuff, but there's a limit. I think the whole hating your parents thing is played out by now (I mean, even Korn has moved on past that). There isn't much talent in this band, anyway. Generic three to four minute hard rock songs, as well as the now frequent acoustic ""ballads"" are all you'll get here. I won't say there isn't anything good about this CD, because songs like ""All My Problems"" and ""Radio in a Hole"" have some catchy parts, but not much could bring this album back out of its unoriginality. You can skip this, and if you want good hard modern rock, check out Three Days Grace. They may not be the best band, but they have somewhat of the same style as Smile Empty Soul, only better!"
1,frowning at smile empty soul fans,id rather listen to my step father file away at his fungus infested toe nails
2,"The Kind of Band ""One-Hit Wonder"" Was Coined For","The first song on this album, ""Bottom of a Bottle"", is a good pop rock song. The rest of the album is not particularly good. It's not outlandishly bad, mind you - ""Every Sunday"" is a darkly enjoyable condemnation of hypocrisy - but the remaining twelve tracks go by with no real consequence.Smile Empty Soul is the kind of band you would follow if they were from your hometown and you had seen them in clubs for five dollars. Nothing about this album after the first song, however, indicates that they'll have any kind of national staying power."
5,Cool CD,"I first heard ""Bottom of the Bottle"" on MTV2 and liked the song. Then I got on this site and listened to the sample songs and knew I had to get the CD. I got the CD in the mail last night and listened to it as I walked to work. I like all the songs but the one I like the most is the first song. It rushes into the head and the body starts to shake. That is how good the CD is."
4,Good Things Coming,"This is one of the best Cd's I've heard in a long time. It has so much feeling, and if theres one Cd you get it needs to be this one. Smile Empty Soul definately sounds like their on their way to good things, and with reason."
5,This band is awesome!,"Bottom of a bottle was the firts song I heard. I totally liked it and listened the other songs. And then I just couldn't stop. All the songs are just great. If I had to choose my favourite, I would definitely say Silhouettes. This is just a great song. We can say it's a rock ballad in a way and it also has great lyrics. But then all the songs on this album are just great."
3,DECENT,"decent CD, i like mabey half of the songs on it. First track though is just so damn annoying, when i heard the song i hated the band and never gave them a chance. As time went on i was exposed to some of their other songs (Silhouettes, With This Knife, Nowhere Kids) and realized that they wern't as bad as bottom of a bottle."
4,Good but not great,"Okay all you people who say they are a mix of Trapt and Puddle of Mudd with the lyrics of Staind, you are right. But I love Trapt, Puddle of Mudd, and Staind. There are about 5 strong songs that i love to listen to:1. Bottom of a Bottle2. Silhouettes3. Nowhere Kids4. Your Way5. The Other SideThe other songs are just okay...<Also Derek Gledhill, the drummer, i believe is outstanding. Just buy the cd cuz it is worth listening to."
2,Dissapointing,"My last review on this album was a little harsh. They are a good band with lots of potential, same goes with Trapt. At first when I heard ""Bottom of a Bottle"" I was thinking (is this the new Puddle of Mudd song that I've been anxiously waiting for?). Then it turns out its another new band called Smile Empty Soul. I was intrigued by there name so I wanted to find out more about this band. Luckily, I downloaded the songs because I find this album to be somewhat boring, and they need to practice a little more. Another thing that makes this album bad is the production. Also, there drummer is one of the worst I have heard. Hopefully there sophomore release will be much better."
1,I expected more.,"After hearing the single ""Bottom of a Bottle"" I was expecting a different sound than the rest of the cd is. Not impressed at all."
2,What's the difference?,"First of all let's get this straight, the only reason this managed 2 stars is because 1 star is only for something as awful as a local band where Im from. Second I just cant see the difference between this and any other mainstream rock band that is out there. It just doesn't sound any different. For example, if you put a mix of puddle of mudd songs, trapt songs and smile empty sould songs on a CD I couldn't tell it was from different bands. How can so many people be proclaiming this band as a great when trashing original bands like Queens of the Stone Age, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, and The White Stripes?"
1,Get a Beatles record instead.,"All of these people here say that Smile Empty Soul are ""the best band ever"", but that can be chalked up to their ignorance and lack of knowledge of good music.Get a Beatles record instead. You'll find more love and peace of mind on there."
2,Too whiny,"First of all, I started to like Bottom of a Bottle and decided to pick up the cd. The problem is the whole cd is like Bottom of a Bottle. All the band does is whine and complain about crap that rarely happens to us. If you listen to these guys long enough you'll probably end up wanting to kill yourself. This self-titled album is now somewhere in my basement covered in dust."
2,Started great....went down hill,"It starts off good with Bottom of a Bottle but the rest is slower just stupid stuff about I hate my mom, hate my dad, take drugs. I like 1 song on this CD the rest sucks."
3,asi...asi...,"A lot of my friends listened to Smile Empty Soul before me, and they said it was a excellent CD. When I finally got it, I wasnt totally disappointed. When I first saw ""Bottom of the Bottle"" on TV, I almost [urinated in] my pants. Well, not really...but I was just really excited to see this stuff. I'm really into the grunge-type sound and the alternative sound of the early 90's and Smile Empty Soul is hitting pretty close. Sean Danielsen has a powerful voice, and his lyrics will make you think. I do question his spiritial beliefs, in a lot of his lyrics he has references to God or ""a god"" and it sends mixed emotions to me.The songs are all in all pretty good, some of them sound the same, but it's all still good. Theres nothing really about Smile Empty Soul that makes them stand out from any other hard rock band, but it's a awesome debut..."
3,Not all Bad,"This is not a band that deserves a 5 star rating. Now before you all start whining and complaining about my rating, listen and here my words. I do not think that they are a bad band, they are not bad at all... I just do not hand out high ratings like they are pieces of candy to a kid. You must earn it.For instance, where do they get off singing about a war and men and women whom they know nothing about. These men and women chose to defend our country for a reason, they knew what they were getting into when they enlisted in the armed services, but this band would have you believe that they are a bunch of mindless robots who will do anything to please their master.Its ok to sing about such things if you were somehow involved or knew of such people, did they talk to a Marine, or the president, my opinion is likely not. They simply took a hot issue in the news and ran with it.I like the guitars, and some of the lyrics, but they need to be backed up."
4,A standout in its crappy genre,"This is a very good cd, with crunching guitars mixed nicely with acoustic grooves. The singer is very pissed off most of the time and he doesnt really hold back his thoughts on anything. And as for the review below me, please tell me the words Nickleback and original did NOT appear in the same sentence together. Please. Nickleback is possibly the worst band ever, and stands proof as one of the crappy bands that SES is compared to."
1,Too Much Angst,"If youre a disenfranchised teen who likes bands such as Linkin Park, Good Charlotte, etc. this is something that youll undoubtedly like. But the fact of the matter is this album is really just beating a dead horse. If youve heard Puddle Of Mudd and Nirvana youve heard this band and they dont bring anything new to the table. They dont have any real musical talent, and the singer is a 4th rate Kurt Cobain."
1,UGH ANNOYING!!,jeeze this singers voice is so annyoying expecially when he sreams-WOOF! it makes my ears bleed-im sick about hearin about you bad childhood and you love relationship gone bad-get creative with you lyrics-o and by the way anarcy SUCKS!
4,A New Twist,"I'm usually a Heavy Metal/Rock kind of person and when I heard ""Bottom Of A Bottle"" I was pleased. I went out and bought the album and I loved it. It's a refreshing new twist on the music played on the radios today. Many people don't like what the lyrics really say. I have to say, Who cares?! So what! Maybe you don't agree with what they say, get over it. Enjoy it. There aren't that many bands like this out there, who aren't afraid to speak what THEY think. Try looking at it from their point of view."
5,Great!!!!!,Smile Empty Soul is an awesome CD!! They can put out there feelings in a way that no other band I've heard can! They not only express themselves but also what other kids are feeling. Its truly an awesome CD!
2,This is a good book hiding in a mediocre book,"This is a good book hiding in a mediocre book. An exploration of what the English think of themselves and why, including the historical aspects that form these ideas. But this book ranges far and wide, yet never reallay makes any firm points, with wishy-washy swipes at how what the English think of as their nherent Englishness isn't really, maybe, kind of. (Yes, it's that kind of book) The last chapter especially is bland - a swipe at New Labor and Modern Britain that really misses its chance to say anything important. There are some interesting facts and snippets, but nothing feels particularly revealing or explanatory.A disappointing read - i have been living in the UK for 18 months and i hoped to learn something new."
5,One of My Favorite Authors for Middle- and High- School Students,"I love Gordon Korman's work, and this book was one of my favorites as a kid. Can you imagine a school where none of the students care about anything? Where no one ever goes out for sports, runs for student council, or even knows the principal's name? There are bulletin board announcements still up from fifty years ago, because no one cares enough to take them down.What happens when a kid who DOES care moves in? And what if he nominates for class president the one kid who really doesn't care AT ALL? Suddenly, Don't Care HS students find themselves doing AND CARING about all kinds of crazy things! Lots of fun!I wish this book would be turned into a movie. I could imagine Mike Otis being played by Jon Heder a'la 'Napoleon Dynamite'."
5,The guide to surviving high school with your humor intact,"I have read this book at least twice a year ever since I discovered it in 9th grade. Almost 10 years later, I still think it is the funniest, most honest book about the alienation every kid feels in high school, and people that you wished were by your side through it - not because they were perfect or always knew exactly what to say, but because they were more human than most of the people you had to go to school with. I remember reading the book out loud to my mother on car trips, and she stole the book from me just so she could read it faster, she liked it so much. It transcends age groups."
1,Useless,"This book is almost completely useless as a guide to Milan. It doesn't include any helpful information, such as addresses or phone numbers of important sites, and much of the ""factual"" information is incorrect (including misidentifying a painting at the Brera). The information on the Lakes is also so slim that it will not be any help if you want to actually do anything there. It does have a very small map that was slightly beneficial, but most of the smaller streets are not named. A waste of money."
5,"Very nice, great quality.",This ring is perfect. Just like the picture. The fit is good and the ring is very nice and shiny.
