4,COMPLAINT,"THIS IS A VERY NICE CHAIR, COMFORTABLE AND GOOD QUALITY.....HOWEVER, I AM TOTALLY DISGUISTED WITH THIS COMPANY AND AMAZON FOR DEALING WITH AN OUTFIT LIKE THIS.....WHEN THE OTHER ORDER FOR THE 2 ADDITIONAL CHAIRS ARRIVED, WHICH BY THE WAY WAS SUGGESTED TO ORDER BY AMAZON, AS A MATCH....AND THEY DON'T MATCH AT ALL...I EMAILED THE COMPANY, REC'D A CALL FROM IVAN, WHO SAID HE WOULD CALL ME BACK AND THAT WAS IT...NOTHING ELSE....I WANT THESE 2 CHAIRS PICKED BY AND TAKEN BACK, AND I WANT 2 CHAIRS THAT MATCH THE 4 I ORDERED ORGINALLY....I WILL NEVER DEAL WITH THIS COMPANY OR AMAZON AGAIN IF THIS ISN'T TAKEN CARE OF AT ONCE.....R.MCCOY"
5,Parsons Chairs Review,I bought these chairs for my son and daughter-in-law for Christmas to use with a gaming table they have. I have heard no complaints and actually viewed and used them when I visited in May. I would not mind having them in my own house. They are very comfortable and look more expensive than they actually were.
2,Not so useful as supposed,"As a martial art teacher, I usually buy books looking for hints coming from reknown martial artists.Of course Master Hei Long is one of these, but this time he missed the target: this book is ""too simple"", it shows how to throw punches (just a few kind of punches), with just a lot of illustrations, but with no hints about the REAL deal. In a real fight or in a serious practice you'll need MUCH MORE than this, you need to know when be relaxed, when to tighten your muscles, where aim your punches, how to develop sensitivity, and in this book you'll NOT find all those things."
2,Revelations of reality in an unreal world,"The author presents his story with a pleasant and even refreshing honesty, never making out that he has been misunderstood, misjudged or presenting excuses for his chosen path. The story however is both remarkable and unremarkable at the same time. Remarkable in that to someone like myself who cannot truly comprehend what makes anyone choose this violent and unsociable career path. Unremarkable, because there are thousands of criminals who march to the same beat as Charlie Seiga.His style is very simple, with no pretension or flowery presentation, and is basically easy reading.Overall, it is not unlike many autobiographies by similar celebrity criminals, would probably make a good television script and from the auhors veiled promise, I expect that he will eventually produce a sequel."
3,I agree with cartonpiedra,"This band is typical powermetal. You can do MUCH better with the masters themselves: Rhapsody --find their video for Rain of a Thousand Flames it is AWESOME!Also Blind Guardian, Gamma Ray, Helloween, Edguy, Nightwish, Kamelot, Dragonheart/force (at mp3.com), Sonata Arctica's Silence"
4,Good Power Metal,"I guess this is their debut album and it's not bad at all. They kind of remind me of Freedom Call. Though I haven't really paid much attention to the lyrics, the songs all seem uplifting. They also rock. It shows how much potential these guys have. To me the songs fall somewhere between classic anthems and generic power metal, hence the four stars. Good music but not quite outstanding in the song department. Still, I recommend this to fans of power metal."
4,Xxon Mill Reviews Diemazz - In Shatterd Innocence,"In infinite space and beyond time is Diemazz, a musical product combining the bleakness of existence and the eternal reaching for God. The sounds play out ambient like impending judgement, in the loudest sound of silence where all bow to the creator of this universe. Bleak, swirling cathedrals crowd the night sky, a very apocalyptic, intoxication sound, with little or no drums. A soundtrack for the end of time. ***1/2 stars. -Xxon Mill ForeverIn Shatterd Innocence"
1,STAY AWAY from AMCOR and Their Products.,"The Unit is JUNK. The customer service is THE PITS.When the AC works, the unit is LOUD but cools as advertised.But my unit (as did apparently several other customers' units) failed (the compressor) before it reached 40 hours of usage. When I called AMCOR for a warranty replacement I got a customer service voice recording saying someone would call me back within three business days. And that's exactly how long they took to call me back to see what was wrong. What?!Then, they charged me a hundred bucks for shipping. Junk product with poor customer service and ridiculous warranty terms = AVOID AMCOR."
4,Variable quality,"Little noisey, but works well. I use fans to enhance the cooling efficiency for larger spaces. Update: Was very happy with the first one of these, the second one got banged up on shipping and was missing parts-did not appear to be new as advertized by Amazon. Since it is a heavy unit I haven't shipped the last one back and have yet to get anyone at AMCOR to supply the missing parts requested. Mixed experience on this."
1,Garbage..Don't bother,Bought this 14000 BTU AC through Ebay. I have Portable AC units in the home and this is by far the worst performer. The unit fan is under-powered for a 14000 unit. I have the unit in a 400' room and my 11000 BTU Sharp performs much better. This unit struggles to get below 74 degrees a(and that's after 8 hours of continuous run).I see that AMCOR is out of business now so why bother with the headaches?Pass this one bye!
2,Poor quality and damaged upon arrival,"I bought this radiator thinking it was closest to OE but was unhappy to find the packaging allowed it to get damaged pretty easily. It looked like it had been dropped, kicked and dragged at one point. Made in China like so many auto parts these days. Not that that is an issue it's just some suppliers have higher quality standards than others. This one, not so much."
3,Peter Blegvad lite?,"Maybe he needed to rush some product out to tie in with his extremely wonderful cartoon collection, ""Leviathan"" - I dunno. But the performances in this ""acoustic"" revisiting of earlier Blegvad material mostly pale in comparison to the originals. Even if it's not prime Blegvad, though, it's an enjoyable record in an EZ-listening kind of way, and does have a couple of really cool songs not available elsewhere. Besides, even moderately interesting Blegvad is head and shoulders above just about everything else. This guy cannot write a dull song."
4,plugged in again,"Imagine my surprise in finding a new Peter Blegvad album wedged in the racks between Black Sabbath and Breeders. But not really new, a sort of greatest hits you've never heard of 'unplugged' reworking. I've been trying to get hold of a copy of 'King Strut' for years, so it is great that three songs are covered here. In a way I would prefer a rougher approach, something which the absent Chris Cutler's drumming usually added on Blegvad's earlier ventures. But this is very good, and his singing is very assured. Like another reviewer here, I feel the main point of this album is getting Blegvad back in the saddle for new songs - and the originals here are well up with his best work. Let us see what happens... maybe this will be his breakthrough?"
4,Unplugged is a good thing,"Paring down the rougher bits allows us to really hear what this man is saying. The words matter most here, and they are wonderful and deep. I believe that at least two of the songs fare better unplugged: Scarred for Life and Daughter shine very brightly."
3,Good but not great,Firstly the louvers came very fast. But they were missing 2 nuts. A week later after talking to customer service I recieved a whole new pack with different nuts (strange). Anyway the brackets are not engineered as well as they could do..no wonder ppl are losing them. The louvers themselves look good and are sturdy but the thin paint soon revealed some chips b4 I even got them on. Installation went OK; you just have to be very precise with positioning the brackets.3 and half stars for me.
2,The music ain't loud enough,"I was out looking for a new sound on a rainy day at my local music shop and really decided to pick this album up because it was fairly new, underground, and honestly the green cover was catchy and I grabbed it.To much of my dismay, the album didn't do much for me. I have been listening to it through quite a few times and haven't really felt satisfied. The beats I won't lie are very catchy and fun. The emcee just doesn't fit; his sound is the same on every track and his views upon life are out of whack. He tries to be an R&B; singer but miserably fails. The chores are annoying as well.Being negative on music is not really my thing, but this CD was a flop in my book."
4,Digital Critic with Challenges and No Solutions,"Design on the screen takes the shape of websites, animation, motion graphics, and oh yeah... television. Long before the Mac and Windows boxes on your desk moved points of light, the television was doing it. In Screen, Helfand continues her critical review of all that is visually projected at us through flat screen monitors and television sets. In this collection of essays and critiques, the overall feeling is cynical and embittered. Helfand directly challenges the designers of screen spaces and interfaces to take a stand and make decisions using technology as a secondary objective. Use the pixels, don't let them use you. It's a boastful book, one that'll make you wonder what more can be done."
3,Out of touch,"This book was written in 2001, and it shows. This book was assigned reading in one of my courses in grad school. Lots of ""big"" ideas are brought forward in this book, and Helfland philosophizes an industry that is saturated with a lot of How-to nuts 'n bolts books and little theory.The book however is out of touch, rife with buzzwords, and is quickly losing relevancy. I was particularly irked by the essay that compares Television to the Web, arguing that all the qualities - and shortcomings - of the Web were ""done first"" by Television.The author displays a kind of starry-eyed wonder at all things ""new media"" but the relevancy of that to professionals working in ""new media"" industries is debatable."
3,Not their best,"While it is amybe their most slick record, it is not as satisfying as previous YMO releases. As allways there is some good stuff for those interested in electronic music."
2,For Diehard Fans Only,"This CD is a must for all Saccharine Trust fans. However, those new to the band may be somewhat nonplussed by both the sound quality and the performance -- as this is a live recording. What it lacks in mixing virtuosity it somewhat makes up for in enthusiasm. The rendition of the classic ""A Human Certainty"" is commendable, and the fact that ""An Effort To Waste"" comes in two parts is thrilling. The original Pagan Icons (apparently now rendered Pagans Trust) would be a good place to begin, but you will surely want to complete your collection with this rare treat (originally released as a two album set). Enjoy! You can't beat the price."
2,Miss and hit,"Few real juicy concoctions amidst scattered, admirably depraved brute experimentation, this primordial art-schiz rock may serve as historical guidepost but rarely succeeds on its own content."
5,read it to believe it,"this is one of those stories that is hard to fathom, but sadly it goes on every day in one form or another. jaw dropping, tear jerking, you hate to say it, truth"
5,Does your youth read?,"I bought this book for my sister who isn't much of a reader. It's hard to find books that are interesting for teenagers. Not only will an adult like it, but it is a great distraction for the teenager stuck on Jerry Springer!"
1,Waste of money,The book is great I've read it before the seller is not one I will go through again. I sent this book to a friend as a gift and to my imbarassing surprise it came in portugese. Thanks for not noting anywhere that the book was in a language other than english.
4,Great but....,Great calendar. I love the daily tips and sayings. It is a bit bigger than I anticipated though.
1,Leaky cheap lid that broke,"Of course glass is the best choice of material as it does not absorb or retain smells and is dishwasher safe, but the lid on this is JUNK! The lid doesn't have a gasket between it and the bottle neck. Also the lid is hinged on a thin piece of plastic that's much more poorly constructed then a disposable ketchup bottle, and it broke on first use. If I had seen this in person I would not have purchased it. I don't know how this received such high reviews, maybe the lid was changed after the good reviews? Save your money and buy your salad dressing maker in a store where you can check it out."
5,Lettuce say I like it..,This little bottle is much more than a container....lots of recipes on the bottle and cap fits tight..no dripping. Only complaint is the recipes are close together and the black print disappears as dark liquid is added. I found myself combining bits of two recipes but both were for a form of vinagrette so no harm done. I think we all experiment to our own taste anyway.
2,Not recommended,"I haven't tried the recipes. I only ordered this for storage of my dressing. I have an issue with the cap. It's not as heavy duty as I would like and I feel like it will eventually break off so I have to be careful. Additionally, the dressing gets stuck/crusty in the cap and it is difficult to clean without a toothpick or other small pointy device. And sometimes I have to leave the bottle upside down for a couple of minutes to loosen the dressing because it thickens at the bottom, which has nothing (I think) to do with the bottle. BUT leaving it upside down creates a vacuum so once I open the cap the dressing bursts out.I will continue to use I but I won't buy it again."
3,Good bottle for mixing salad dressing,"The included recipes are sometimes tough to read and/or follow, but the bottle works as described and serves its purpose well."
1,You get what you pay for...,"I bought this item about a week ago after i gave up looking for my last dressing bottle that I lost in our move. The bottle is nice, although I'll admit I haven't tried any of the suggested recipes. However, the lid is very cheaply made. It broke after the first use. I ended up finding a metal cap (similar to a canning lid with the rubber) that I have been using since and it seems to work fine."
3,How hard is it to make a decent lid?,"I love the bottle, but the lid is just junk. I knew I shouldn't shake it without holding on to the lid, but did not expect it to leak while holding the lid firmly in place. Oil dribbling all over and making a terrible mess is not my idea of a good product."
4,Handy Book,"Great book with lots of handy ideas and tricks to help keep things clean the ""natural"" way."
2,Shoes in the Freezer Beer in the Flower Bed,Rather cute title but the books is nearly useless. The suggestions are all things that everyone has know for years. I didn't find anything that I didn't already know. It is also a random assortment of tips that covers lots of things but also omits more things. Save your money.Carolyn
5,AAA+ just what I needed!!,"Red Dragon BP 2512 SVC 400,000 BTU Weed Dragon Backpack Propane Vapor Torch Kit with Squeeze ValveThis unit is just what I needed. Great for the weeds and great for the ice in the drive way. Put together just fine and ready to go. Super nice unit!!"
1,close to worthless,"It does ok on getting rid of weeds among my paving stones, but a complete waste of time and money for getting rid of weeds on permanent basis. Yes it will kill a weed when flame applied directly to weed, but usually the weed regrows healthier than befor. I tried to kill ferns with it,but evry time I kill them they come back!!I don't reccomend it for any serious weed problem.I hate using herbicides,but no real alternative!!"
5,Second best descendents album,"This album contains many of the Descendents Greatest hits. it contains my world, x-mas vacation, silly girl and many others awesome tracks! If you're looking to a great and awesome punk-rock cd, go buy this one!"
5,This is the holy grail of all the Descendents albums,I declare this to be the best of them all because their are a ton of great songs and they had good humor at the right timing. If you are a newbie to the band get this first. you will not be disappointed.
4,My favorite album from Descendents,"Somery album is a compilation of the best from Milos band , but when it comes about their official releases i consider that ""I dont Want to grow up"" is their most solid release and the album that shows to Descendents in their best shape age and moment , this album is funny, judgemental, dinamic, intelligent, 100% enjoyable, 80s punk is amazing pretty much better than punks bands available today , in 80s punk bands had a reason to exists; love for Punk Rock, real love i mean, today theres only one reason: be stars, be rich and be famous, nothing wrong with this but the main reason is suposed to be love for punk rock genre, the rest will come along , but maybe the real Punk rock spirit is dead by now, descendents will allow us to remain better times howeverHM"
5,An Insider's Guide,"This book is marvelous in that it clearly shows new writers what will happen to their material once it is ready for Hollywood. There's movie history and present day information. Edwards & Skerbelis really know their stuff and share it with you in a very readable and understandable way. All screenwriters need to have this knowledge to work in the Hollywood system. Finding out how the ""development"" of your screenplay will happen is fascinating and eye-opening. This book belongs in your arsenal! Michele Wallerstein, Author, screenplay & novel consultantMind Your Business: A Hollywood Literary Agent's Guide To Your Writing Career"
5,If You Read One Book About Screenplay Development...,"...it ought to be this one!The authors are clearly seasoned pros and their insightful observations and advice help to ""fill in the blanks"" about the oftentimes confounding process of screenplay development. I highly recommend it."
5,Most delightful book I have ever read.,"I wonder why there aren't any reviews on this book? It is the greatest book ever written. This book is about a person who has found a perfect harmony in life. Escaping all the scholastic philosophy and theological quest David Grayson here settles for what I regard the highest wisdom and the true purpose of life, and that is living. The book is potrayal of extra-ordinary experiences of a farmer poet who discovers a world within and without and adds a dream world quality with a sense of humour to our everyday experiences. A return to nature, beauty, simplicity, spontaniety and harmony!"
5,A MUCH OVERLOOKED GEM HERE,"This is the first in a series of around eight books by David Grayson (actually this is Ray Stannard Baker writing as Grayson).The title of the work says it all. If you are looking for a very, very mellow read, simply stuffed with wonderful observations, then this is one for you. The style/syntax, while admittedly archaic, is great and it takes only a couple of pages for you to fall into it's rythm. This book was written in the early part of the last century. This work reflects a time long past in this country, but that being said, this work stilltouches many aspects of our lives we often overlook in one way or another. If you can find this work, and the rest of the series, I strongly recommend you purchase them as you will want to read them over and over again. It is a shame we seem to have lost such books."
5,"Wonderful, insightful, optimistic...","There are many great words to describe this book (and many others) by David Grayson. I can't believe there are so few reviews either, the last ones were in 1998! I think it's high time to spread the word about this man and his beautiful observations of who we are and how the simple things in life are what really matter."
3,"good war movies,bad transfers","the movies on this set are all ok time killers,but the transfers are the pits and make it hard to watch. if you can find this one real cheap buy it,otherwise stay away."
2,Sadly dissapointing,"I picked this up in a record store somewhere in Italy last March and was suprisingly dissapointed by it. As someone who really enjoyed ""In Casino Out"" and ""Relationship of Command"" I felt as if they just slapped a bunch of the ... songs from ""Vaya"" (which I didn't like that much) on a cd with ""Invalid Litter Department"". If you're a big fan of ""Vaya"" you might like this, but I didn't."
4,Quick delivery,The movie arrived swiftly and in good condition. It was a present for my husband and he was very happy to get it.
2,"Movie great, delivery not...","The movie is fabulous, but this was supposed to be a Christmas gift to my nephew's family, along with other DVD's ordered via Amazon -- which made promises about delivery within days. How long did it take them. ALMOST A MONTH!"
3,Good trilogy but inconsistent format.,"I liked being able to purchase all three ""Vampires"" movies in a single collection. However, the description in Amazon's ad is wrong: the aspect ratio (format) for all three movies is NOT widescreen (1.85:1). The fact is, the formats are inconsistent:Vampires (1) - 1.33:1 (4x3) ""full screen"" only.Vampires (2): Los Muertos - both 1.33:1 ""full screen"" and 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen.Vampires (3): The Turning - 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen only.The big disappointment was not being able to watch the first movie (Vampires) in widescreen. Why is anyone still distributing movies in the old 1.33:1 format? As far as I can tell, Vampires has never been released to DVD in widescreen.As for the second movie (Vampires: Los Muertos), it is one of those double-sided DVDs with the ""full screen"" version on one side and the widescreen version on the other. Yuck!"
2,BLOOD AND KUNG FOOEY,"If you like your vampires mixed with martial arts, you may enjoy VAMPIRES: THE TURNING. But it's derivative script, sloppy effects and lame acting result in a genre mix that doesn't quite gel. Colin Egglesfield plays the studly hero whose girlfriend is kidnapped by a band of vampires while vacationing in Thailand. Egglesfield encounters another group of ""good"" vampires who he solicits to help him find his woman. Patrick Bauchau is around as some kind of vampire bounty hunter who helps kill the vampires with crossbows. The movie's pace is not kinetic enough to generate any suspense; we've seen the fight sequences done much better in the Blade trilogy, and its climax is anti-climactic, and the ending muddled. Only for die hard vampire or martial arts fans."
3,good good ehhh,Never actually knew there was a third installment in this series. and after I saw bon jovi act I know know how to kill a vampire and a vampire movie.
4,thumbs up,"Saw this movie on STARZ last month and had to buy it for my collection - it's totally cool, very stylish and a lot of fun. Sexy vampires, cool Thailand setting, plus the action rocks. Definitely one of the better films of this genre, not just a gore-fest (though there's some of that, too). You won't be disappointed!"
1,Does ANYONE honestly believe the first 6 reviews here???,"Maybe it's just me, but I get a VERY strong feeling that the only other six reviews for this title were written by the same person, and many of them on the very same day!"
3,good vampires versus bad vampires,"An American in Thailand watches his girlfriend get kidnapped by a gang of bad vampires, so he joins a gang of good vampires to get her back. Nothing great, but it isn't bad. There are some cool fight scenes, but the movie is kind of short. Still, if you dig vampires you'll dig this dvd."
1,Kung Fu Vampires,Got this movie as part of a box set. Best thing about the movie is that it is less than 90 minutes long.
4,Vampires review,All three movies are classic modern vampire movies. All are fun to watch. Highly recommend!
3,A NEW BITE,"This is one of the better vampire movies I have ever seen and I have seen many. Though, every time I looked at the main character, I could not help but think of him as the next ""SUPERMAN"". This is the first vampire movie that combined the undead with a karate chop to the throat.It is something fresh and new with a new twist(the origin of the mother vampire being the key to the death of the species). The romantic part of the movie got a bit confuse--At the end, who did his heart belong to--his girlfriend or Momabites? Besides, if his girlfirend couldn't understand the age old male need to be entertained by violence, she should have stayed home and watched Korean ""Steele Magnolias.""This is the perfect movie for fans of karate movies who also love the horror genre. You will not be scared but you will be entertianed and left wanting more. A 3.2 on the scale of 5."
1,Purchased T pins - not a toy,"I purchased T-pin, which we use to tack up notices and pictures on cubicle walls - Your are the only company that handles the size (1"") that I needed. All office supply stores have dropped this product and only carry larger T pins, which rip holes in the fabric covering the cubicle walls"
4,"Forester ""T"" connector","I had a little difficulty installing this plug. The directions tell you where to find the receptacle, but there is a foam filler piece that has to come out to access it. I was not sure how to remove the filler piece without breaking it.It was held into place with velcro and a snap fitting, after removing it just plug and play."
2,Actors who can't read,"Ok, I LOVE Dorthy Parker but this CD set is hard to listen to. The chick from sex in the city starts it off and LOST me in 10 minutes. Sounds like she could use some read-out-loud lessons.I guess these stories just don't ""read"" well out loud.I suggest reading the books yourself."
1,"Give it an ""A"" for ""awful""","From beginning to end, the students in the AP English Class at my high school where stunned by the ""over-dramatic"" and offensive imagery portrayed in this movie. It was too much to bear. I would never, ever recommend under any circumstance borrowing, buying, or being gifted with this film."
4,everything rock was supposed to be & wasn't...,"'Trees were the most criminally overlooked band of the ""GRUNGE"" revolution, which makes little sense seeing as how, on this LP as with so many of their others, they were the ideal rock & roll band. The Van Conner bros. guitars tumble and crunch in all the right places, Barrett Martin always pops in with the head-spinning backbeat, and singer Mark Lanegan, with his smoky baritone and hallucinogenic lyrics, shows an almost preternatural instinct to frontmanning, dispayed in the fantastic 'Straight Thru To Any Place'. This album, with it's wacky keyboards, shows the band's sense of humour as hapless indie lads, and is not their most representive. But people who deem themselves true fans of modern rock, not to mention come-lately 'Trees fans, would be doing themselves a disservice not to hear this at least once."
4,Cydonia Rocks!!!,"Sci-Fi Mechanics along with Maiden Type Vocals And Wonderfully crafted Guitar Solos. That about sums up Cydonia. It doesn't contain rip-roaring music but what it contains is a fine example of excellent musicianship. Cydonia combines good lyrics, clean and crisp vocals with great basslines and drumming. The Guitar work is flashy and well done. Over All A Great buy. You won't be dissappointed. Metallica sized riffs along with Maiden type rhythm guitaring, this italian band does it all. If you like this then most probably you'll also like Helloween. My Suggestion : Try BOTH!!!"
3,A Garden of Delights,"I don't read much poetry but like Robin Morgan's other books, and someone gave me this for my birthday. I literally laughed and cried and ""tasted"" these poems like I never had any others. In fact, the tiny entire novel that is each poem here was gripping, and not at all inaccessible. A poet friend tells me that Morgan is a real, fine poet, and now I know why he feels this way. Her older poems here are more ""formal,"" then later on she lets loose with passion. The skill (and wit) is Stoppard-ian, the politics feminist, the poetry lyrical. Now I actually am reading more poetry!"
2,"weird movie, no conclusion","I was expecting a movie, not a documentary. If I didn't pay for it I would have turned it off after 20 minutes"
1,I want that last hour and a half of my life back,This was incredibly boring - the twist wasn't much of a twist at all.. and in the end was still left with that feeling of not being satisfied.
2,About the same quality as a TV show about a weird crime,"The film was not terrible, but for the price it was a definite disappoinment. The beginning was very slow, and the story about as interesting as many reality TV shows about weird crimes and strange people which are on every week for free. I really can not recommend it."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"This was a fairly uninteresting story which captured the imagination of some documentarians and led to nothing of real interest or value. They committed to the project and ran out of money so they tried to recapture their wasted investment by dramatizing a very boring and dull human interest story as if it was iconic or held some universal theme worth their time and money, and worst of all, yours and mine as well. Pass - very boring and unessential in a world full of real stories and situations which need and deserve our interest and attention"
1,Hated it,I really don't get the accolades for this movie it didn't answer any basic questions and my husband and I both dozed off during the movie.
2,More questions than answers.,"This movie ended kind of abruptly with very little investigation in to the detective's theory or insight from a psychologists about how on earth this happened in the first place. It's astounding that a cascade of willful ignorance occurred at this level -- from local law enforcement, to the FBI to Interpol and down to the family who lived with him. They missed an opportunity to delve deeper in to the psychology of grief and identity disorder. Disappointing."
5,Engaging Documentary,"Yeah, maybe a little too stylish for a documentary but still very informative and thought provoking. My mouth was open the entire movie with incredulousness."
1,Hated it!,"Just wasn't what I expected! Trailer kinda fooled me into thinking it was an awesome movie.. ofcourse, they used the only good clips in the trailer."
4,A documentary for documentary nerds,"This film has great story-telling, amazing editing, and characters that couldn't be made up. It kept me engaged and fascinated throughout. I loved every minute."
5,Wow,"This movie was really interesting. It seems like they did their reveal of what was going on too early, but you'll soon realize there is a lot more to the story then what appears at first. Good documentaries do this, and this one goes pretty far to create the surprise moment towards the end. Even after that moment in this movie, you still are left thinking about it."
3,"Where are the ""twists and turns""?","The movie was OK but I was waiting for all the jaw dropping moments to happen like other reviewers stated & got nothing. We know from the beginning he wasn't their son so what's the big twists and turns? Super disapointed I paid for this, not worth $8! Was a good documentary but expected something else I guess from what other reviewers said."
4,Unsolved Mysteries,"If Errol Morris had done this documentary he would have solved the mystery. Also, this guy gets his kicks by toying with the families of missing children, a lot of families, and today he is happily married with three kids. I no longer want to live on this planet."
3,"Not what I expected, but good none-the-less.",I thought this was going to be a regular Hollywood style movie but it was more of a documentary. It turned out to be very interesting. A crazy true story! It's worth a 2.99 rental.
5,totally creeepy,"But excellent. Offers no clear answers but underlines the pathos of sociopathology. We watched in a group and were glad we did so. Afterwards there is a major ""ick"" factor."
2,Not A Riveting Drama Full of Twists Nor an American Gothic Story--Just a Documentary in the Guise of Fiction,"Amazon should categorize this movie as a documentary on the website, but that it not the case. The trailer and description of the film on the website are misleading.If you are into this sort of film, you might like it; but when I rent a movie to be entertained by fiction and instead find myself watching a documentary, I am not happy.As for the quality of the film, there's a lot of talk and and no suspense. If you want a good mystery, you won't find it here. The basic tenet of the film is that people believe what they want to believe. Not much of a revelation for me."
1,DO NOT waste your time,Not worth watching!!! I don't want to say what happened in this movie just in case you have an extra two hours to waste
2,Just read the news,"I don't know what to say other than I just didn't find this that entertaining, interesting, or revealing. Just about everything in the documentary can be learned through reading old news articles...there wasn't much additional insight into why Bourdin assumed the false identity, very little examination of how the cracks in the system allowed this to happen, and why the family was so desperate to believe he was their long lost son."
2,Just seemed like a regular documentary to me.,"But I'm not really into artsy sundance festival stuff. So I really don't know what the hype was about. I felt like I was watching the history channel there was nothing too intriguing in the ""movie"". I kept asking myself why are they giving this criminal the attention he craves by making a documentary about him??"
5,Chilling!,"The story is unbelievable. It has a unique set of perspectives as it includes interviews from the police, the family of the missing boy, and the imposter himself. Definitely a must see even if you're not a fan of documentaries!"
3,Unbelievably true,You watch this movie and cannot believe it really happened. You are left wondering what is wrong with the family as well as the imposter and sadly you never get answers.
1,"couldn't finish, not a movie","Was just interviews of people talking about the incident, no actual movie. Very boring. Might as well have been watching Snapped."
3,the imposter,It was interesting how the imposter pulled off the scam and how the family accepted with no questions.Pro- how the system needs corrections.
4,"Not my style, but very well done.","This is a documentary, with minimal re-enactment. Very well done and worth a watch, but it wasn't really my type of movie. The pace is not really slow, but the movie feels slow/unexciting through most of the length.Still, it meets all the expectation of a good documentary and was interesting enough to keep me engaged."
4,The psychology of deception.,"The easiest person to deceive is someone who WANTS something to be true (but is not). If you were intrigued by the Manti Teo (Notre Dame football player) fake girlfriend story, you will like this."
3,"Did not live up to trailer, amazing story though.","Had a group of people watch this and we liked the twist, but the twist was a lie too :)"
4,A documentary that was every bit as suspenseful as a good thriller.,"Truth is stranger than fiction in this movie about an imposter that assumes the identity of a missing child. Gotta wonder why the Texas authorities didn't do more to help. An artsy montage of images and sound bytes, the producers of this movie did a fantastic job of telling an unbelievable story. A must watch."
5,So creepy,incredible story. very haunting. keeps you guessing until the end! glad I purchased. wish there were more movies like this.
3,"Good, could have made it a lot better",Pretty Good build up to an unexpected twist. Would have preferred to see more acting and less documentary style narratives.
1,Disappointed,"I purchased this dvd on the basis of earlier reviews, but was extremely disappointed. If one expects the quality of HBO's Rome or Showtime's The Tudors, the expectation will be way too high. Calling it more a lower grade tv production (but still no match to BBC's I Claudius) is more correct. The length is tedious, the colour washed out, and the production sets only so-so. The acting is more difficult to judge, since the dialogue is in Polish, but I saw no performance of better than average. The English subtitles, like all subtitles, give only a synopsis of what is being said, and I found that many of them do not fit the screen. If the dvd were cheaper, perhaps it would be acceptable, but at this price I would recommend buying the old MGM version of Quo Vadis which is vastly more entertaining and better edited."
4,The Second Time Around,Any viewer would immediately begin to compare it with the Hollywood epic of the past but in retelling the story the more youthful Polish actors are less stilted and plastic than Robert Taylor and Deborah Kerr. Or was that due to the screenplay? This version follows the novel much more closely and Nero does not dominate in the retelling even though I must admit I prefer Peter Ustinov's portrayal. The only major flaw is the rather disjointed language of the subtitles that makes the viewer figure out what was actually being said.
1,Great for little pets but not for your children,"I have purchased the deck shield after reading several good reviews. The product is simply plastic chickenwire fastened with plastic one-way ties (similar to police handcuffs).During the installation, I realized that the item is not strong enough to shield a toddler. The netting broke with minimal amount of tugging and pushing, especially where it was fastened. Once a few squares broke, it was easier to propagate further failure throughout the plastic netting. I feel this product is unsafe for children.The bottom line: this netting would likely be adequate as a deck shield for small pets but not for little children. Hope this review helps."
5,Perfect Couples,"We LOVE this show! I was surprised that it was cancelled and even more surprised that another network didn't pick it up. What was the most disappointing was that there was't much advertising for it...this show never really had a chance because we just happened tio stumble on it...it would be really neat if more episodes were made!! I would buy all of them! Phrase pass on to powers-that-be...it's a smart, funny show! Bring it back!!"
1,Painful,So painful to watch. Had to force myself to continue to watch - thinking it had to get better - they would never put a horrible show like this on primetime. I was wrong - it never got better. Not sure how this show got on the air.
1,Train wreck,"In no uncertain terms this show is an utter train wreck. Cast chemistry felt more like the second meeting of a high school theater class than anything that should be on TV. In all seriousness, I felt like this was more of a vehicle to pull in the male audience via Olivia Munn than a serious attempt at a sitcom. 23 Minutes of people screaming at each other and rehashing the tired ""men don't understand women"" jokes just isn't the type of thing I see making it more than a few episodes."
5,My wife loves this show,I wish this would come out on DVD but great to have an option to be able to see it until that happens
1,Made no difference,"I have Vonage VoIP service. Call quality is acceptable most of the times. Call quality is bad when I am downloading and uploading torrents. Thought this device may help by managing the available bandwidth well. Followed the instructions, got it installed and was expecting improvements during torrent activity. Made no difference. Call quality remained as bad as it was during torrent downloads and uploads. Tried tweaking few parameters at the console. Did not help. Overall, no improvements by using this device. Going to return it. Planning try Hawking broad band booster and see if that help."
1,Don't know if it works or not.,"I received the unit and connected it as per the documentation. I attempted to configure the device through a browser, but cannot get my network to see the device at the IP address listed in the docs. Spent all kinds of time on the phone with tier 2 tech support folks. They advise that although the device is configurable through a browser, that it is plug and play, and that being able to connect via the browser interface is unnecessary. I have noticed no change or improvement of any kind in my VoIP speed or quality. I cannot recommend it and I have no way of knowing if it even works or not."
4,Seems to work well,Works fine running a Asterisk server along with 2 pcs - seems to have stopped drop signals from the cable provider which had become a real problem prior to the install.
2,Don't buy this item,"I've been using this item 3 weeks ago and i didn't notice any diference with my lags on games like xbox 360 or ps3, maybe if you use this item for VOIP it could be work, but if you try to use this for games DON'T BUY IT don't waste your money."
4,O-M-G,"Well, if you're new to the Floyd, this is exactly what you should buy. This is their creative peak, without question.This is a bit more expensive than I would expect for 4 CDs, though..."
5,Excellent 80's Metal,"Buy It, I said Buy It what are you waiting for?? Listen guys and gals, if you were a teenager sometime in the 1980's thru 90's you must hear this CD, I've had this on cassette for many years and now I have it on CD, this Is what Metal Of the 80's is all about, these guys totally rock, nearly every song is a hard driving metal anthem, no this is not the progressive band you may have heard recently, this CD is all about crunchy/chunky guitar riffs and well written songs, I told my friends I found It On CD and now I have to order 4 more CD's, I just hope It's not sold out..........."
2,Pieces and Pontifications,"I got this to read only one section, can't remember the name of the essay now. It was okay, however, I thumbed through the rest of the book and saw all the bad language and I threw it in the trash."
4,"Great price, poor strap system","This stroller rides very well and the swivel wheel is awesome. The locking pins broke within a few months when folding it. Inconvenient to take on a flight since there is nothing to hold it in fold position. It does fold into a small volume, though.Very easy to push.We are not sure if our child who is almost 1 is comfortable in it. We don't like the harness since it is very inconvenient to strap. The back does recline but it does not look very comfortable. There is no padding in the back and our child is still in a very much reclined position even when the back is in its most upright position. There is also no support for underneath the legs of the child.Despite all these things, we do think it was worth the price."
5,A real pleasure to read.,"Grace Services book is not only an amzing account of an important period in modern Chinese history, it is also an important personal, first-hand account of how foreigners worked and lived in pre-liberated China. Set during the late Qing and early Repebulican period, the book tells the story of a family who goes to China committed to serving the Chinese people and how they stand strong in that commitment through wars, civil unrest, and personal tragedies. This book is a must for anyone interested in the pioneering spirit that led foreigners from around the world to settle and live amongst what most westerner at that time (stupidly) considered an ""uncivilized"" people. The book is made more vivid through detailed historical and personal footnotes added by Grace's son, the noted dipolomat and ""China Expert"" John S. Service. A wonderful contirubtion to history and a wonderful read!"
3,Michelin's 1919 Guide to Rheims,"The Michelin Guides written right after World War I provide numerous black and white photos depicting the devastation of the cities and surrounding villages during the War. Having walked many of these paths, the ground is still cratered. The destruction of World War II did not leave the permanent scars that trench warfare did.The guides provide a nice village to village itinerary for seeing the Marne front."
4,Great gift for yourself or friends,"I gave this book as a bridal shower gift and it was the hit of the party. We have played the ""Love Cup"" and ""He Said, She Said"" at a couple of parties and everyone had a blast. Months later, we still laugh thinking about those parties."
5,MF Doom,"I am very pleased with my purchase. It came much faster than I had expected. As for the album itself, There's too much to say. The beats are all fresh and blend well into each other smoothly. It has inspired me to get back into the studio and crank out more of my own beats. Thank you MF Doom for keeping my fire burning for this life of hip hop."
5,An eclectic mix that's sure to satisfy...,"I was introduced to MF DOOM in Art School and have enjoyed his wit and style for years now. This box set is the perfect companion to any collection of his work and is the only affordable way to own all the herbs. Super chill background music, 70's, 80's lounge and if you have seen the new film 'Grindhouse' you may recognise a few tracks from the 'Intermission' sections. A scholar, a gentleman, the one and only, MF DOOM."
4,Songs Mix but so do the titles,"More than 80 songs! That was the first reason why I bought this wicked collection of MF Doom tracks! Instrumentals all come from special herbs 0 - 9 which I think is unreal since it all fits into 2 cds and plus you got a bonus cd with 10 hidden tracks. The only major flaw in this album is that the songs dont go according to the titles displayed in the inner flap of the cd case. For example, it says the song is played on the first track but it is really played on the 8th track. Really confusing but other than that...4 stars!"
5,Yowsas!,"This is a very solid Cd set, 72 tracks mixed-blended by MF, and 10 bonus tracks. A sure buy for any fans of MF Doom or any of his other aliases, also a good buy for those that like Underground Hip-Hop, underground beats, or just overall good music. Very fun mix, there are technical flaws, but this is not as much a mix Cd as it is a compilation CD.Anyone who even has a slight intrest get it, there are only 7,500 released once they are gone, well they are gone."
4,"good, but not what I expected","This album is pretty good, as you would expect from any madlib, metal fingerz, ect but falls short on the length of the individual tracks. All of the beats are only about half to a third of their original length. But if you do not own any metal fingerz and like hip-hop beats I would highly suggest this cd set. Also you might want to checkout rjd2 or dj shadow."
3,hp tablet was ok,"The laptop works fine, the condition was okay. For the money it was worth it tho and my daughter enjoys being able to have her own PC"
2,HP TC4200,"The basic concept of this computer is excellent and I have found the tablet function to be useful and fun. However, managing software with it has been a nightmare. It is unclear whether the issue is XP or XP for Tablet PC, but I suspect it is the latter. Every time I have loaded software it hasn't worked - seriously, every time. I have had to do numerous workarounds, and still many programs are not working. HP has been very responsive, but it doesn't change the basic problem with the software. I do not recommend this machine nor XP for Tablet PC on any computer."
4,"Great bag, could be better distributed","the OVR wheels are excellent, no heavy pull on your arms, the only issue is the proportions, the bag itself could be roomier, and the daypack smaller, the handle does take some space inside the bag so it feels smaller, but well constructed, if you do not whant such a large large backpack it's a bit bulky, get the Tarmac and buy the daybag on the side..."
3,Good for short term,"My son loved these as part of his Woody costume. He wore them everyday so they wore down pretty quickly. The ""cowboy"" part comes apart from the boot. It is a good purchase for a costume, but if you need real rain boots, I would not buy them."
2,wish they were made better,"Bought these for my son for his harvest festival at school. He loves his rain boots, but these fell apart at the back seam before they could even protect him from the puddles. Right up the back of the boot where the rubber meets rubber it just came apart. Sad because these are adorable boots and even shoe glue and duct tape could not make them work for a bit. I will just stick to buying a cheaper store brand now."
1,fell apart,These boots were a total waste. If you live in town and plan on wearing them twice then they are for you. These were worn a month and not everyday only for mud and they feel apart where the brown goes to the tan they really just fell to pieces. You could be better off getting overshoes at walmart.
4,Cowboy Rain Boots,I bought these for my son and he loves them. They are well made and will last him for a couple of years.
2,rain boots,"after barely a month they fell apart. we did contact thecompany and they replaced them.we have bought rain bootsbefore,not from this company and not with this problem.hopefully they will last longer than a month.with all of that we can not give them more than 2 stars butcustomer service so far is a 5 star."
5,Very happy,I ordered this to add to the flatware I already had. I was very happy with the purchase and the shipping was very fast.
3,"Nice, but not necessary","I bought this pen after losing my pack in pen for my X41. I liked the idea of having a pen with more heft, an eraser on the end, and classier styling. It fulfilled all three of those, but in the end I bought another replacement for a couple reasons.1. You have to carry it around seperately, since there is no built in storage slot for it on your laptop.2. Heft is nice for a few minutes, but if you're writing notes for an entire class it gets annoying."
1,Bad Valrhona cocoa?? Better believe it.,"Just like another reviewer, I decided to try some Valrhona cocoa, having held up their products as the platonic ideal of all things chocolate. I could not believe how bad it was. I tried it in four different applications, including cooked, boiled and raw, and it tasted smoked or burnt every time. Callebaut trumped it so easily that it was silly. Heck, I'd even choose crappy old Hershey's over this horrid tasting powder. What a waste."
3,Replacement #3?,"Not quite. Am trying to find a replacement to Hershey's Dutch processed cocoa, which they ""improved"" and made worse. Made devils food cake. This brand did not produce a deep rich color and taste was average. Also made chocolate ice cream, color and texure were good but taste wasn't what I was looking for. It did not leave any after taste though. Will not buy again."
2,Not as I expected.,"The product I recieved was not ""Ice n Heat"" as it was pictured also it said that it came with a cover. I only recieved the gel packs and no cover. As far as item use... We have not used them yet."
3,3 option does not contain 3 gel packs,"There are 3 options for ordering, 24, 12 and 3. Since the 24 and 12 options are for a 24-pack and 12-pack respectively, I assumed the 3 option was for a 3-pack. It isn't - the 3 option is for a single pack. So be careful ordering..The pack itself works well, I've been using two of them for icing achilles tendonitis pains for about a year, they still freeze up and work fine."
3,It works as advertised but not a great product,It starts losing its heat or cold properties in 20 minutes or so. It seemed that I was traveling every few minutes to get another one.I guess it is good for the price you pay.
3,works well for the price,"These work well with the knee holder, just put them in the frige and when the one you have is done, get a cold one."
3,singstar country cheaper,"This is a great game. To bad the price is jacked sky high. Singstar is coming out with a country version that looks awesome, for a lot cheaper price."
5,This game is a blast!!,"I think this game is the greatest!!! I hope they come out with a vol 2 for country. I am now addicted to karaoke revolution and want them all. The older ones are quite expensive however. This game is fun for all ages, and there are different levels (easy, medium,hard, expert) so even if you aren't that great at karaoke, its still fun. You can also adjust the level of the vocals in the background so that you cant be heard as much, or you can take them out completely and sing alone. All in all this game is fantastic!!!"
2,Misses the target,"This book appears to be a forum for expressing a variety of personal opinions. There is something to offend everyone. Pit bulls are misunderstood lambs. All drug users should be thrown in jail. NAFTA makes everybody feel like the losing side. Smoking is good. Owning many guns is a good idea. Too bad freon isn't available anymore. The new stuff doesn't cool as well, environment be .... And on and on. This book would have been much more interesting as a novel instead of political polemic."
2,"Good program, bad support","The program is pretty good, but it isn't much better than Fritz 7, and isn't much faster either, so it doesn't seem worth the extra over just the normal Fritz8. I'm also really annoyed about the support - my CD came without a user manual, which means that I don't have a product key to register my copy, and can't play online. Amazon blamed the publisher, and the publisher blamed Amazon, and I still don't have a manual or a product key."
3,The Ultimate Chess/Research Program,"Deep Fritz 8 and Deep Shredder 9 are the two best research programs available out there. Yes, if you have a computer with only one superfast CPU and a ton of ram, you are better off with Fritz 9, since it's more affordable, and it is optimized for only one CPU. Having said that, Deep Fritz's playing strength increases dramatically if you go from say 2 CPUs to 4 CPUs. The interface however hasn't changed much, which begs the question: What has chessbase been doing during the past year. I mean going from Deep Fritz 7 to Deep Fritz 8, you need to add more features and capabilities to your program to make people want to buy it. After all, Deep Fritz 7 is pretty strong itself, and since most of us use chess program for playing and analysis, using either program doesn't make a dramatic difference. The Verdict: Over-Priced, But Strong. Well worth it if you have a huge load of money."
5,a great size treat for healthy dieting,"These cones are sized for kids, but are the best size for healthy dieting with only 5 calories per cone! I use these cones with low calorie ice cream and I also make them into ""pudding cones"" (as I call them). To do pudding cones for special occasions, I measure out 1/2 package of 4 flavors of puddings. It's a colorful self-serving buffet style dessert. I suggest noting directions such as: Place a spoonful of whip cream in the bottom of the cone, cover it with a spoonful of pudding and then top the mixture with an additional spoonful of whip cream.Using low calorie whip cream, one serving of a pudding cone adds up to about 4-6 T of filling and about 50 calories per cone. For even less calories, use sugar-free puddings."
1,Do Not Buy,"Rod came in a huge box with lots of padding. Rod was bent and wouldn't expand. I have bought hundreds of items from Amazon and this thing is pure junk. Considering the packing job, the item must have been bent before being packaged which indicates a merchant that is not worthy of patronizing (Geroy's Building Center)."
1,THIS IS USELESS,"This curtain rod is useless; it constantly falls down, arbitrarily and without cause. Sending it to the Goodwill, but maybe they won't even want it as it doesn't work. A regretful purchase even at this price. I guess you do get what you pay for."
2,Ok for the price,"I purchased this rod to replace my old tension rod that was accidentally broken. This one, by far doesn't measure up to my previous rod that I bought at a discount store. You would think that with a brand name like this one, it would be top of the line, not the case. The caps on the end are plastic instead of rubber which makes the rod slide out of place frequently. The tension really has to be tight for it to stay in place and hold my 1 panel sheer up. I would only purchase this rod again if I couldn't find another tension rod in this size."
1,levolor Kirsch tension rod,"I am not please with this purchase. I depended on the name to be a sturdy product, which it was not. It was so light weight that the rod would bend just trying to get them inside the window. I should have brought the product locally but I do depend on Amazon for good products and good prices. Did not reuturn them because I opened most up before trying one. Live and learn."
2,Junk,"Flimsy, weak, poorly constructed. I honestly just threw it out when it came. I wasn't expecting much for what I paid, but I was expecting a little more than this."
3,Just ok...,"I purchased 6 of these for my sunroom triangle lites above the straight windows to hold a small curtain to filter out the sun in the early morning. They worked perfectly. They are inexpensive, so I'm not surprised that they are rather cheaply made. My problem is that two of them arrived damaged. I wrote to the vendor and sent pictures of the damage and I got NO RESPONSE WHATSOEVER. Therefore I am giving them a three star rating and a big ZERO to purchasing from this vendor."
3,cheap and did the job....mostly....,"The rods arrived well packaged and I immediately put them in to use. One was broken on arrival, however, somehow I had a spare lurking in the deep dark corners of the garage, and used the spare instead. No harm, no foul. The rods are undoubtedly cheap in price and quality so if that's what you want, look no farther."
3,would have bought somethig differant,i boht the rods because hey were inexpensive. I have an issue iwth them bcause they actually bend rather easily. I used themn for sheers which i thought they would be fine. I think it is more the pressure the tension causes. I am not sure if I should expcte these to bend or not for the price. I sorta lean toward the fact thta whey should be a functioning product regardless of the price.
3,It does the job for light weight curtains.,"This is a very small, thin tension rod. If you put any pressure on it, it will bend. It is for very light weight curtains, a bathroom window is what I used this for. It is what I expected based on what I paid. Great for renters or for those who have just moved in and need temporary window treatments."
3,lets hang dude!,"This adjustable rod works well with a twist and has a nice finish to it. It is nicer than what you buy at the cheap box store but it is what it is, an inexpensive way to hang lightweight short drapes. If you are afraid of a commitment to drapery hardware or are a renter this is a great way to go."
1,get what you pay for,"It comes shrink wrapped after a cardboard box the plastic wrap is extraneous and lasts longer than the few metal parts of the rod which has fell down 3 times in one month, the last one i had broke when i stressed the cheap plastic threaded tension rod so I'm worried about breaking this one. The finish scratches very easily as the shower hooks are already wearing the finish off. I would not recommend this product. I'd bite the bullet and go to Bed Bath and Beyond where you can return any item with no questions as long as you have the receipt. The fact that Amazon supports the Fascist oppression of free speech & Wikileaks is one more reason to shop elsewhere and if you can't at least buy a better shower curtain rod."
1,Disappointed,"While this is a good brand item, it turned out to be too weak for 1 panel of a light woven fabric. Have to buy something else."
3,Only to be used for very lightweight curtains,"This tension rod is very inexpensive, and works well only with extremely lightweight curtains. I tried to hang one panel of an Eclipse brand black-out curtain and the rod slowly slid down the window frame."
1,Cheap rod... cheaply made,"This pole broke within a week. Wasn't expensive but seriously... I was hanging a small-normal sized bath towel on it.Advice: if you're going to use the spring mechanism, spend the extra $$ on a better rod. If this is just resting on wall hooks or something similar, it should do just fine.Don't think I'd recommend it a friend."
2,Flimsy,It just about holds up a small kitchen curtain. Anything heavier than that makes the rod bend in the middle!
2,flimsy rods,"I have bought many a tension rod over the years for different apts, homes, etc. I thought being levolor they would be good quality and also nice looking. They are neither..."
4,Brought this time period alive & was easy to read,"While the story of Geoffrey Hudson, Lord Minimum, is an interesting one and worth reading, the author really succeeds in making Hudson's entire world real and accessible to the reader. I love it when a good book generates an interest in me to learn more about the subject and times, and I'm now interested in reading more about the court of Henrietta and Charles I and his trial and subsequent execution. Nick Page occasionally is a little tedious with his constant foreshadowing of upcoming events, but it was easy to forgive him this because his writing is easy and engaging."
3,Much too hard,"This would be great for someone wanting a really firm pillow, but it just hurt my neck more. I do find it pretty good as a headrest while sitting."
4,Memory Foam pillow for cervical arthritis,"This pillow was suggested by my physician after my diagnosis of cervical radiculopathy. It arrived quickly, and though it took a bit of time to get used to it, I really think it has been helpful in relieving the pain."
3,could have been a lot better,"The concept was interesting, but the writing was a bit too sentimental for me. Clenched fist of defiance, anyone? I also thought that it could have used a little more nuance; for example, it constantly referred to the colonists as ""patriots"" (when, frankly, patriotism was in the eye of the beholder; many British Loyalists would certainly not have considered the colonists to be patriots). I prefer to read Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's Paul Revere's Ride to my son."
3,Fun book...but start way before you're 30!,"Learning a language, learning to play an instrument, taking a solo vacation... all good things to do by the age of 30. If you're 29 1/2 and want to squeeze in a few final things-- rethink this one! There are certainly a number of ideas that can be done in a day or two (swim naked, of course). However, give yourself a good 5 or more years to complete the rest!!(While this has no bearings on the content, I have to mention that the book arrived damp- there was even condensation inside the packaging... I'm not a fan of wet books!"
3,Ehh,"It was silly lil things to consider doing before your 30. Quick read though. I did most of them already, so guess I'm ready to turn 30."
2,Funny book,"This is a great book if you are looking for solid info on this topic, this is a wonderful that is informative and you will not regret purchasing it!!!"
2,Fun... but not fabulous,"This is really a bathroom book or something cute for the coffee table. There is nothing really great about the book (except the title), but it was kind of fun to flip through it. I read through it in less than an hour and tossed it (I have no room for it in my bathroom or on my coffee table). The book might be cute as a gift, however it's not something that I would put on my bookshelf and keep. I read all of the other reviews before buying it and I guess my expectations were just too high."
4,Works great,So far so good. It has rained a few times these past few weeks with strong winds and the umbrella has not given me any problems. The smell on the Handel Is not too bad and is nearly fading away with time.
4,UMBRELLA,A MUST HAVE ITEM FOR GOLFERS. WORKS GREAT KEEPING ME DRY WHEN NEEDED. ALSO KEEPS ME AND THE DOGS DRY WHEN WALKING THEM.
5,strong umbrella,the umbrella i just rec. here is got to be the best umbrella i have ever owned we have had some pretty nasty weather out here in the los angeles area the umbrella held up fantastic if you want a great product get this one
1,"Looks good, but actually isn't.","Bought this umbrella back in August because I was tired of the cheap umbrellas breaking in the wind. Well, it didn't break in the wind, it just broke for no reason under its own weight. There are plastic hinges used on the supports, one of them just suddenly broke and swung down, hanging there. My best guess is there was some sort of problem with the plastic and it fatigued.Anyway - think of it as one of the cheap disposable umbrellas, just bigger."
2,Handle smelled like chemicals,"While the umbrella looked nice, the handle gave off a strong unpleasant chemical smell. I tried airing it out and soaking in soap water, but it did not go away. It smelled up my apartment and left a strong smell on my hands too. I can only assume I received a defective one, although I will just be returning it rather than risk exchanging it for another."
3,OK UMBRELLA NEEDS WORK,"OK Big umbrella. Cheap. YES the handle smells very bad, so remove it. I cut mine off immediately and sanded the glue off. [ I think the GLUE is what stinks.] This cut the stench down to about 90%. Is still a bit smelly but I can handle it and think it will go away in time.I think I am going to hot glue a chunk of bamboo on for the new handle or maybe use a old mountain bike grip after expanding the skinny fiber glass handle with duck tape or the like."
1,"More like a ""WindWillBust Umbrella""",1st used and the wind broke it! The wind blew it reversed and that's it. Had to throw it away.
1,Not Made from Good Materials,I received the umbrella in a box that was way too big for the umbrella. I went to open the umbrella and one of the sticks that is inside of the umbrella was broken already. I did not even get a chance to use the umbrella once before it went in the trash!
1,"Golf gifts and gallery 62""wind buster umbrella",Worst mistake by buying this it broke the first time I used it. The wires ripped right thru I was only able to use it for 15 minutes before it broke
1,A Disaster,"I was impressed with the prompt delivery of this umbrella. I did not have to use the umbrella for awhile, since I was out of town. Upon my return, we had our first rain a few days later, and upon opening the umbrella for the very first time, one of the arms broke off!! Never did get to use this umbrella and am EXTREMELY disappointed with the poor quality of this item."
3,For golf only,"Not as sturdy as advertised. Did not last a year before in broke under heavy rain and wind. Searching for a replacement. Under light to medium rain, it is good golf umbrella for the money. It may not hold up in a heavy storm."
3,Great umbrella but broke with moderate wind (gusts of 48mph),"This umbrella is not windproof, which means it will still invert or break in winds, but will last longer than regular cheap umbrellas. The handle offers a great grip, and although the issue of it smelling has truth to it, it's not such a terrible thing as others claim. The parts seem to be rust-proof (I have had another windproof with metal parts which rusted over...)and should last a while if there are no strong winds. This one lasted me almost 2 years in NYC."
1,Disappointed,"Deceiving picture!!!!!!!!!!! ITS NOT BLACK, its mixed with blk and white triangles. I needed an all black umbrella. Even the label says black/noir, so deceiving. Im sending it right back. How do you expect to do business by deceiving the customer....good luck #$$%$#@# Dont buy!!!"
1,poor quality,I thought this would be a good deal but the handle broke on the first day. It was an inexpensive and poorly applied glue that held the shaft into the handle. Not worth it and an unfortunate waste of my money.
1,Poor Quality,"Quality of the Umbrella was very poor, low quality plastic is used and broken on 2nd usage itself. I don't recommend this product"
2,Poor Quality,"The umbrella broke after two uses under its own weight. The supports are made of a cheap plastic and one of them snapped when i first used this umbrella. The second time I went to use it, three additional supports broke, likely caused from the first failure. This is a good size umbrella at a great price and would be great if the supports were stronger. I will be returning this product for a refund and replacing it with something of higher quality."
3,"Kinda ""clunky""","I have owned a number of Iron man Timex watches. I liked the looks of this one on my my computer screen but found it to be really ""clunky"" when I got it. The small compass on the band could have been left off and can be easily removed. The display is very good and I like that. The band, however, is rubber and that I do not like!! I bought based on it having 2 time zones, multiple alarms, a light and reasonble cost. It's ok for the price but wish I could have seen it locally first. It was not available at my local Walmart though. Should last me a few years. Good for price and features."
3,Timex Expedition Wristwatch,"Purchased to replace a failing Timex Expedition. The case is larger and thicker,providing a feeling of bulkiness while performing the same functions as my older watch. The new Timex comes with a compass which is totally cluless about direction."
5,mid-size and reliable,"I've had this model of Timex Expedition for 6 or 7 years now, the one watch, I've had it on doing rough work in the country and it's gotten a bit beaten up but it keeps working fine. In fact looking beaten up gives it character. I did have to replace the band a couple of times. What I like about it is that (1) it's a good mid-size digital watch: not bulky but still easy to read; (2) it's easy to turn on the light at night: no trying to find a light button on the side; (3) switching between two time zones is easy: just one press and you don't have to look what you're doing (I regularly go between time zones); and 4) the timer and the stopwatch work well. I took the compass off after a couple of years: you had to hold it very flat for it to work okay, but that's a minor point. If the one I have ever gives up I think I'll get another just the same."
5,Timex Watch,I ordered the watch on Timex.com and it was about 45 dollars. My brother then told me to look on Amazon so I did. I paid about half the price for the same watch. Came in the original box and all. Great deal! Totally satisfied.
1,What a waste on money for me,"Had the watch for two weeks before i went swimming my max depth was 8 feet, far less then the 100m then the watch can supposedly handle. water got in the watch and shorted the thing out and its no good now. the $10 watches at walmart have lasted me longer and have been through far worse"
4,Great watch,I gave this as a gift to my son. He really liked it. It a great quality watch that he can use it everyday.
4,A brilliant book for Trompe l'Oeil enthusiasts,"Creating Grand Illusions: The Art and Techniques of Trompe l'Oeil, is a fascinating book written by an extremely enthusiastic artist who so loves what she does that she is amazingly generous with imparting her knowledge in how to achieve these 'tricks of the eye'. A book highly recommended for beginners and anyone interested in painting!"
1,Well meaning is not enough,"Apparently well-intentioned but inept presentation, this isa step backward in poker publishing. The English syntax aloneis disqualifying. Disappointing, because the world needs agreat book about low-limit high-low split."
1,Not up to par,"This may be the worst poker book ever written. The stylistic problems are legion. If that was the only problem, I could overlook it. The fact is that there is simply no useful, understandable information to be found here. You're better off with Sklanksy, Malmuth, Jones or Krieger."
4,Does what it needed to do,"We have two Yorkies and we wanted them on the deck, but they're so small, we didn't want them falling through the railings. This netting has worked well and the black is difficult to see, so it doesn't ruin the deck's look. It was time consuming because the deck was big, but easy to install."
3,Review,"Well, I thought I'd write a review on this since no one else has.First off the good. This product does transmit wireless sound and video to your home TV. Works great, pictures good quality, not great, but that could be because my TV is old, I'll know for sure this week when i get my New 42' in.The bad: Distance is a real issue, you can't get the reciever to far away from the transmitter or you get bad video quality with many breaks in the feed. If your in another room, you can forget about it. The devices themselfs feel very cheap, and if you use any type of wireless internet, forget this product. The wireless net interferes with this product and you done get ANY video.This does seem to work well when you've got line of sight from pc to tv, my max distance is at about 10 foot, then i run outta room . Works good, but could have been a great product."
3,Clean signal most of the time,"The product is prett simple to setup and and signal looks good when there's no interference. I live in an apartment and I think my neighbors microwaves/bluetooth/wifi was scrambling my video, and this was happening enough to make the product useless. Switching channels rarely helped. I ended up returning it and amazon gave me a full refund. I built a cheap htpc for watching videos and it works great.*Note* If you are going to hook up your PC to your TV with a cable then make sure you get a coaxial isolator or you will get some annoying scrolling bar on your TV. It's caused by a ground loop and it took me forever to find out how to fix it."
1,Nothing Good to Say,"I have absolutely nothing positive to say about this product... Even with the transmitter and receiver sitting within 2 ft. of each other, pointing directly at one another, with or without anything between them, the signal is sketchy. The picture quality seems ok, when I do get a picture of signal. Any vibration in the house makes screen flicker horribly and the units do not work at all while I use my wi-fi network, portable phone, or when the microwave on the other side of the housed is being used. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! Get a wired product and drill holes in the wall if you need to."
2,Not the best,"I wanted this unit to stream video from a PC in one room to a TV in an adjacent room.It was easy to deploy however the audio crackled and snapped, and every time someone walked into the path of it the picture would distort. Never did get a good picture on it. Also, the ""T"" adapter made my PC screen blurry and close to unusable. Sent it back for refund. Got a pair of RF-12's instead, and they work great.Stay away from this one."
3,Stumble into melody,After initial gimmicks wear off decades down the road this may lose some interest of course. But beneath a lot of this primitive experimentation and gleeful incoherence lies some genuine tunefulness and still-humorous moments which can make this a rare treat if used on occasion at best.
5,The last geat full length album by Negativland,"Sure, Dispepsi has some funny moments, and GUNS (or U2) is a funny parody. Helter Stupid was a funny concept but was just a masturbatory romp through their ""Chrisianity is Stupid"" scandle. So here it is, ""Escape from Noise"", the last real album by Negativland worth owning.This album has a ton of guest contributors, like Mark Mothersbaugh (Devo) , Jerry Garcia, Billy Graham (in sampled form) Jello Biafra, and Ivan Stang from The Church of Subgenius. It has alot of different types of music on it, but almost all the songs are funny as hell.The album is not as musically pleasant as ""Points"" or as brilliant as their debut album, but it's essential to anyone wanting to check out a band that once kicked some bootie in the experimental genre.I also recommend the video tape they put out, ""No other possibility"". It's a VHS tape of live footage and ""videos"" and is hilarious!"
3,Good Temporary Measure,"***I keep buying these and buying these and buying these. Each one lasts for a few months, and then the stopper part separates from the strainer part. This does work for my kitchen, utility room, and laundry room sinks. However, I wish I had something that would last longer. Apparently the pressure from the water when the sink is stopped up is enormous, and I have them break when I go to unplug them. I wish there were an alternative! If/when I find one I'll note it here.***"
2,Was pleased,At first this was great. But after a month it broke. The pop up is made from plastic and seperated from the strainer.
1,Awful!,"Is there a zero star rating? I'm here checking out Amazon, hoping to find something to replace this product.The stopper doesn't work properly for my sink, so unless I spend some time getting it in exactly the right position, the water drains out slowly. Even if I do get it to stop the water, if something bumps the strainer, it knocks it out of position and I have to fiddle with it again.Alternatively, if I actually want to let the water drain, often the little stopper part twists and falls down, so the water drains only very slowly, and ""backs up"" if I'm letting the water run.Awful product!"
1,Out of date and unusable.,"I ordered this product for my grandson, a budding astronomer. His parents tried to get this cd to work in the advertised way.They finally found out that this particular product is out of date, doesnt work, and to upgrade to a workable product costs almost $80.00!! We returned the product to the seller and I;m getting my grandson the program from Starry Night directly."
3,csongwork,This stater does not fit on my truck even thought the description said will fit on a chevy eight cyclinder 350. I gave the starter to my brother who was able to use it for his truck. I can not judge the quality of this starter but it is a remanufacture from China. I am sure it works since my brother been driving his truck with out walking due to a break down.
4,One of my favorites!,"Wild Rose sings STAR OF BETHLEHEM like no one else. I had the cassette, which I dug out of storage just to hear that song. Wouldn't you know, the old cassette player ate the tape. Thank goodness I found this on Amazon!"
2,Too Small,"This product when it arrived was just about worthless. I bought it for the price and it was too small for even a small room, it was very loud and I believe it may have broken. There was some kind of problem with it because I returned it the next day and never looked back. After this I ended up buying an air purifier that swirls around water to clean the air, I liked that very well."
3,It's just ok,"I have a new car with a strong new car smell so I got this. It doesnt seem to put much of dent in the odor but it does help a little bit. When it's on high power, rhere is barely any air coming out at all. Not too powerful!"
2,"noisy, worked a few times","i only used it a few times. it is not quiet enough to sleep near...unless you wear earplugs. the noise is annoying when using in the car. it takes 30-60 mins to clean the air in a small space...and after using it a few times, it doesn't come on every time. i think the switch is faulty.it's too late to return via amazon. i contacted vapor-eze."
3,Brakes easily,I returned it the first time because the odor feed broke. Amazon has been great in sending mr a new one but the exact same thing happened to it. I hate to go through the return hassle again so I just patched it up and use it without refilling the odor feed. So it looks good in my car and hopefully does what it is supposed to do but as far as that small piece in the back of the device it is guaranteed to brake.
1,Good idea poorly made,I like the size and the design but the car adapter broke after a couple of times.
1,broken!!,"I ordered 2 of these items. I used only one 1st. It didn't even last 30 days & it won't run anymore. The 2nd one, I used for 3 days & I do not want to use it anymore. How can I return them? Please HELP. I did not purchase them from the dollar store, so we expect our money's worth."
3,Lost Album,"This album is pretty good, but I am looking for a copy of an album they discontinued in 95' called I Luv. If any body has a copy or if it can be sold again please inform me. This is one of the greates albums Hr has done since Bad Brains."
2,Hell's Bells #2,"Most soundscape recordings are of a time & place, an environment for listening based on local ambience. Steven Feld's three bell CDs are different -- each one is a series of sound effects recordings tied together by only one theme -- bells.There are church bells. There are herds of sheep wearing bells. There are bells on clothing. Ceremonial bells. Musical bells. Cow bells. Bells on trucks. Windchime bells. And not just short samples either, most of the recordings are 8-11 minutes.These are the kind of recordings a person into sampling might buy, or a person making a movie soundtrack. They're not even remotely usable as CDs you might listen to for enjoyment."
3,Confusing for such an easy read...,"I enjoy fantasy books, especially stories featuring animals like the Redwall series by Brian Jaques and Watership Down by Richard Adams. ""Run To the Wild Wood"" is exactly this kind of book, and my grandmother brought it to me all the way from Ireland. Amazon seems a much easier and better way to go. I enjoyed the book, it was a very easy read, but it was a little confusing. I lost the plot in a couple places. The story made cross references, and I think I missed out on part of a series. I got the characters confused, I kept forgetting which fox was which. I recommend it for younger readers who like fantasy books, but beware: it's not the kind of book you can read while distracted by music, talk, tv, etc..."
3,An intersting mix of mostly obscure trax,"I'll admit upfront that I like the Cab's later works MUCH less than their earlier, abrasive 'industrial' sounds. That being said, this collection finds them moving away from said abrasive sound towards a more acessable vibe. There is a lot of fine music here, but as a whole it doesn't work that well for me. ""Lost Possibilities..."" that closes out disc 1 has one of the most annoying beatbox rhythms ever, I guarantee a headache to anyone who listens to all 10 min of it. Why three versions of ""Sex, Money, Freaks""? To be fair, the remix of ""Drink Your Poison"" is nice and the live tracks show what could (and could NOT be done)live. Not a set for a neophyte."
4,Hubby very happy,Brought this wallet for my husband for christmas - overall wallet was well made and attention to detail is was good.
2,Good Reference Text; Poor Class Text,"I used this text a few years ago when I was writing a paper on ethics of pesticide use, and it certainly details information well. However, the general tone is often anal and the writing style is extremely drab. Most of the diagrams included were generated using low-budget graphics software, and it shows. At 811 pages, this is an overly long book and not all the chapters (24 total) can be covered in a single Echem course. Also, there is no solutions manual and the problems Manahan gives are challening (a section of numerical solutions placed in the back of the text would have been nice...) This is a good reference text, but if you're looking for a semester-long or short-term text to use for an Echem course, use Baird's text, not Manahan's."
3,Good for a quick laugh,"This movie stars Stephen Chiao as an out of work acting instructor who falls in love with a prostitute that can't pick up men. The prostitute comes to Chiao to learn how to act in front of men, but ends up falling in love with him instead. Basically, its a romantic comedy that will get you rolling at times, but is too slapstick-like to beleive. In my personal opinion, its a good movie overall. Chiao is hilarious and just watching him is reason enough to see this movie. However, don't expect it to be one of Chiao's best... he is getting old."
5,Very Nice Pendant,"I was very pleased with the quick delivery of this product. That's a big plus for this seller. The pendant was also much nicer than it even appears in the picture. The colors are very rich and vivid. This is a versatile piece that could be worn in a number of ways. As someone else mentioned, it does have a nice weight to it so it centers nicely. I think you'll be very pleased with this pendant."
4,Bermuda Blue,I bought this and the Pinkas gifts for fellow employees in my office and they both love the colors and clarity as well as the perfect size of the crystals.
4,wearing this today,"I am wearing this pendant as I am writing this. It's very very pretty, only trouble I had was that some of the backing flaked off so it is clear in a spot or two. For the money it is quite eye catching. It's not a forever piece but so pretty in the sun!"
4,Lovely Pendant,This Pendant shines when light hits it. My mother is a collector of these. I bought two of the Swarovski Crystals for her and she loves them. They will add to anyones jewerly collection.
2,Not Like the Original,"If you look at the preview of this book on CBD, you'll find that in this adaptation Christian is a boy, not a man. The characters names are completely different and the dialogue is not only translated to more modern language, but has also been changed a lot. This book is much more like Little Pilgrim's Progress than the original by John Bunyan. If you're looking for a story that is close to the original, I would look for another one. If you're looking for one that has turned Pilgrim's Progress into the story of a boy, not a man, then you might like this one. I do like the illustrations I saw and the story is fine--it's just not the original."
1,Original beauty lost in this adaption.,Bunyan's masterpiece is perfect as-is. Why someone would destroy a beautiful piece of literature is beyond me. Geraldine McCaughrean seems to be simply another example of a wannabe author leeching off the skill and hard work of real authors like Mr. Bunyan. I advise reading the true work of John Bunyan and avoiding the fake recreations like this one. JFM.
3,Interesting but not what I was looking for,"This dvd might be helpful for some, but for me it was weird. I just couldn't get past the lack of waxing. Just way too much hair for me. I'm a female and don't like looking at all that hair...it's definately dated, and was just kind of weird for me."
5,Excellent pen,"This is a great pen, the line thickness is that of a ballpoint or similar, so it's easy to use on a regular basis for filling out forms with small spaces, or just for taking notes. it's very sturdy, and I've had no problems with it. I'm using a cross converter for ink with no troubles.The only problem is that Amazon says it ships with a converter included, it does not. You MUST order the converter separately."
3,Some of it is great,"I love the feel and weight of the pen. I am currently having a problem with the pen leaking ink on my fingers. Cross is usually good about repair, it's just a pain since it's brand knew."
1,Not what you might expect,"The other reviews might be right about one thing. This is out of the ordinary.That is possibly the only thing positive I have to say about it. It failed to capture me as a spectator. The ""arty"" music cuts were misplaced, ill-coordinated and disrupted the dialogue. The dialogue might have been interesting, but looses points on the bad sound quality on portions of it. I don't blame the director for it, but he really should reconsider his ideas on editing. The frequent and sudden cuts disrupts any form of timeline, adding confusion to whatever this documentary has in mind to convey.In fact, it was hard to find out what this trial was all about if you didn't know who Eichmann was and what he did.No, I didn't get the point of this, nor am I afraid to be so unpolitically correct as to say so. It did not make me any more enlightened of Eichmann or holocaust watching this. In short: this is an unecessary waste of time and money. I recommend reading Hannah Arendt instead."
3,FAMILY SHOULD ENJOY THS ONE,A+ for the film's strong family message: the grandparents are wonderfully charming; the brother and sister get along; the kids even say prayers before going to sleep. This along with the cute talking animals should keep the family entertained. The worst part is the horrible overacting of Charles Fleischer and Laraine Newman as the villainous Bert snd Bertha Bimini; they're so over the top they're ultimately annoying. Good old Hal Holbrook and Rue McClanahan are pleasant to spend a few minutes with. The talking effects are crude but oftentimes quite humorous and hang on at the end for an animal danced version of that golden chestnut DISCO DUCK!
5,My Son LOVES it!,"My 3 year old loves this movie so much he asks for ""Rusty"" every day. My family thinks it's funny that every time the TV is on, ""Rusty"" is on - We know the movie by heart now."
1,"Really, really dumb!","This movie is stupid, crude and dumb. Don't waste your time. It's just too juvenile with crude physical humor and you'll wish you didn't bother.Concerned Christian Mom"
5,So GOOD it's Spooky,I bought Spooky House for my grandchildren ages 4 and 10. We watched it together three times on Thanksgiving. Then they watched it three more times the next day. It is great entertainment and a moving story for everyone. The kid characters are great. Mercedes is a super comedian. Ben is threatening and then loving. Disney wishes they had made this one!
1,I SPIT ON YOUR CHOP SHOP,"This is a bad rape/abduction film that takes place in a body shop. Lisa ""I have legs and cleavage"" Stewart (Shannon Michaels) needs her car repaired after an accident. She keeps a ""journal"" which is a composition notebook. She returns at night, overly dressed to pick up her car and becomes a tool for the crew.The film starts out claiming this is a true story that happened in 1994 Riverdale, Ga. There is a most irritating uncredited narrator who pointlessly describes what is in the journal. She takes long pauses while she puffs on a cigarette. The acting was bad and you wanted to see everyone die. The sound quality was poor. One of the mechanics, (Rob Rose) starts out with a Jersey accent and then switches to a southern accent. The script was rather Spartan. No character build-up.Great title. Nice cover. Slightly inaccurate as Lisa wore a black bra and not white.Parental Guide: F-bomb, no nudity, rape. girl/girl scenes."
4,A treasure re-discovered,"[this review is of the Bloomsbury USA 2011 reprint]A book that certainly deserves to be back in print. With a deft hand, Thomas Williams gives us a story of a writer giving us a story; weaving story on story until the reader is happily lost in the layers. In these pages is childhood, youth, coming-of-age, adulthood, responsibility, recklessness, struggles to keep things from changing, struggles to move on, and struggles to make the world live up to our dreams. If I started to describe the stories, I'd never stop writing. William's is a master craftsman and this work left me with that rare but delicious sense of coming out of a dream that, for me, marks the best of fiction. Thank you Bloomsbury for bringing this back, and for giving us the brilliant afterword by WIliams' daughter, author Ann Joslin Williams."
2,Crowley Scholars Look Here!,"Contrary to the two other reviews here, this novel-within-a-novel simply does not work. It involves far too much navel-gazing. And, for navel-gazing to work, the author has to be a poetic master of language, such as John Banville, for instance. Williams is simply not such a master.The only reason this book is of any interest of all is that, amazingly, the author John Crowley obviously took some of his ideas from it. Lilliputown clearly gave Crowley ideas for what is considered his masterpiece (though not by me): ""Little, Big"". But, also, the surname Rasmussen, so prevalent in the Aegypt cycle - which IS Crowley's masterpiece! - is found herein, and nowhere else in literature that I've come across.The novel qua novel is an indescribably boring waste of time. For those looking to do a doctoral dissertation on Crowley and his influences, however, it is a treasure trove indeed!"
3,"Black Friday is good, but Fatal Blade is one of the wosrt movies I have ever seen",The only bad thing about this 2-pack is that Black Friday has decent picture quality and Fatal Blade has very good quality. I just wish it was the other way around.
5,Just what I wanted,"I wanted a medium-sized batter bowl for small cakes, crepes,and the microwave. I have used it to boil water in the microwave for a large pot of tea. Today I made a cake and the hand mixer blades did not scratch it. I bought the green because it was so cheap, a real bargain."
3,"rigth what the picture sells, but a little fragile","I really like this costume because it was what i was expecting, one thing i did not like it's that its fragile where the appliques are so i had to saw them back each time my child wears it, but at least it was what we wanted."
3,disappointed,"I have listened over and over to this CD and I just don't like it as much as Kelly's other ones. Her voice is absolutely perfect as always, I am just not enjoying the material as much. For first timers, go with her older CD's!"
5,kelly took a piece of my heart....,"again!Kelly Willis has been a fav. of mine for sometime. Going thru things where I used to and still do (in my heart) call home my missing cd ""Easy"" fell out from the side of the stereo area and when I relistened after a few years it made me order ""Translated"". So many great songs here....BANG BANG....:) p.s. ""little one"" has to be my fav. because where I found my ""Easy"" cd was at my late Moms house... felt like it was sang and written for my family......thanks kelly...."
1,waste of time,"The white people were not portrayed well in this movie either. As a gringo who has always liked hispanics, I found it disturbing to see Puerto Rican characters always regarding white people as rude, calculating, ruthless, and prejudiced. German/Herman's conversion into that kind of person is not so much about the difference between hispanics and whites but rather the difference between, say, a small, family-owned business and impersonal corporate culture.If you want to see some really good movies about Hispanic Americans, try Raising Victor Vargas, Wassup Rockers, Manito, and La Ciudad. (I've heard that Washington Heights is also good, but I haven't seen that one yet.)"
1,Embarrassing,I am Puerto Rican. This a complete embarrassment to all Puerto Ricans. I had to forward through most of the movie to avoid the completely ridiculous scenes.
1,"Could have been better, if a real Puerto Rican wrote it.","I am a Puerto Rican also, who grew up, knowing about all the different branches of our heritage... Yes, there are Puerto Rican, who hate other races... like everyone else... but, you know what? Not all of us are that way... I am proud to be called a ""Boricua"", which apparently, the writer of this low rated movie, does not know where that nickname came from...I have to agree with these people, who have written their comments... this movie is an insult to our loving culture, that has whites, blacks, even asian descendants, coming to full circle, in our daily lives. We live in the same neighborhood, and still, we get along.So, when you pick this video... make sure you know, that this is not the real Boricuas here."
1,my iq dropped,"im puerto rican and i too was so disapointed at this movie.i feel this movie represents ignorant people not puerto rican people.""BORICUAS"" we have alot of pride and this movie is not something to be proud of.NEXT TIME SOMEONE TRIES TO MAKE A MOVIE ABOUT URBAN PUERTO RICANS HOPEFULLY THEY WILL MAKE IT A COMEDY"
1,trash,"I am a Puerto Rican male that lived most of my life in the Chicago Area where the film was shot.( I attended Roberto Clemente High School - where the main character of the movie attended)Hence , I was very in this film.I hated this movie. It makes my skin craw when I think of other people watching it. All of the Puerto Rican charaters are presented in a very negative way.Everyone involved in this movie should be ashame !!Trash...Thanks Alot !!!Miguel"
2,SMELLS TERRIBLE,"I had to stop taking it because the smell is terrible, smells like moth balls and bad breath which is what you taste when you take it...."
4,Great watch!,"This is the second Timex Expedition I have purchased - the first one got a nasty scratch across the face after three or four years of constant use. Unlike my first model, this one comes with a leather band, but is otherwise the same sturdy easy to use/read watch.It's features include the Indiglo back light, timer/count down modes, water resistant to 100 meters, multiple alarm modes and more.For the price, it is a great durable sports watch."
2,Misleading specs,"To bad I have to do this, but the case is NOT metal and the crystal is NOT mineral. It is a PLASTIC case and a PLASTIC crystal. A call to Timex before I bought the watch indicated that the case was metal. It is not, but the back, as normal, is. The strap is not just nylon, it is nylon and leather. Come one Amazon. I have to dock all these stars because of this?That said, the set-up of the watch seems to be very intuitive for me with modes actually spelled out. The bezel material is rubber, which I like. The backlight shines THROUGH the numerals, not the background, which I also like. The back uses 4 small screws. I also like that it does not beep every time I press a button.CONCLUSION: Nice menu system, readable, and nice backlight. I think I will like this watch. However, I was looking forward to a mineral crystal like my other expedition. I am mostly docking the stars for misleading advertising. Thats silly and should not have occurred."
4,Expedition Improved,"This version of the Timex Expedition watch is better than similar earlier versions in that the display has larger characters, the date characters are not so close to the edges as to be hard to read at an angle, buttons respond with lighter pressure, and the Indiglo feature illuminates the characters rather than the background, making them more legible in the dark. These noteworthy improvements are counterbalanced by an uncomfortable and unattractive strap. Fortunately, attractive replacement nylon/leather straps are readily available."
3,Color Is Off from picture,"This watch looks OK, but not as expected from the picture. The color for the item received is green not tan. I gave it to my son, who seems happy with it. I will look for a tan watch."
3,A Good Heroic Bloodshed Film,"A basic story of two gangster brothers is a springboard for some good action sequences/gun fights. Chow Yun-Fat plays the younger brother who seeks to get out of the life of crime. Alan Tang is his older brother who wants nothing more than to remain a Triad boss. Turf Wars erupt into violence. Chow leaves the Triad, only to return to save his brother. A lesser known Chow Yun-Fat film, with a good, simple story and a great action finale. Worth a look."
4,Obtuve algo bueno por mi dinero,"Es un delicado trabajo en plata, que se ve bien. Lo único negativo es el tamaño que no deja volar muy lejos la inventiva a la hora de pensar en fotos para colocar en su interior, pero en si solo el corazón será un buen regalo por su acabado, simple, pero bien hecho."
4,Click to Calm,"This book contains many good ideas that could potentially help not just aggressive dogs, but all dogs. It covers the necessary basic commands in addition to specific commands that deal with the various problematic situations that an aggressive dog can encounter."
2,Click to Calm,I found that these techniques did not correct my dog's aggression to other dogs. It felt like I was distracting him more by focusing on me and giving positive reinforcement. However when my dog saw another dog it was VERY difficult to distract him even with treats. I have sought out another positive reinforcement training technique with a trainer in my area. I have already seen my dog's behavior decrease with a quick correction and praise when he follows the correction with the appropriate behavior. Maybe this technique will work with other dogs but it did not work with my chocolate Labrador.
1,This thing is horrible! I don't even know what to use it for!,"I don't even know why I bought it! What does it do? What do I need firewire for!? Please giving me technical support! I have no use for this equipment, it is so useless. If you want a firewire pc card, then you have one here, it does nothing but give you the firewire and I don't need that! It just sits in my desk drawer! USELESS! DO NOT BUY UNLESS YOU NEED IT AND HAVE A USE FOR IT!"
4,Lund Rear Deflector,"Easy to install, does a very good job of keeping rear window clean and free of dust/dirt."
3,I only LOVE 3 songs on this...,"The only songs I love on this are tracks 13, 11, and 9 -THEY RULE!!!! (but for some reason, I have never been able to get into the other songs on this album -I guess I'm not really a fan then?)"
3,so/so,lou deserves more than this.considering how long he has been in the biz and the many songs that he has done and what not he should be able to have a box set of his material.he is still a better vocalist than over half of what goes for singing today.this disc doesn't do him alot of justice.it's only half way there.
1,Defective CD // Lou Rawls,Product was DEFECTIVE when received by me.Product was too cheap to even think of mailing it back for a return!!!Learned self lesson.....in future don't buy cheap.
5,WOW!!,"This is a terrific album for anyone to own. The songs are listened to by all members of our family....my 91 year old mom loves ""you'll never find, another love like mine""..... incidentally, would love to be able to find this particular song on CASSETTE for her to enjoy on a cold winter's night. Anyone???"
1,Mermaid making Kit - disaster for all,"My daughter (7) received this for Christmas. Normally, she is very good with art kits and I know when I need to step in and offer some adult supervision. This thing is a piece of garbage. The first couple steps are great and easy fun. Then you get to cutting the fabric for the tail. Even the adult (me) couldn't do it properly. The fabric rips and tears as you try and cut it in a neat scallop edge. I'm frustrated, my daughter is frustrated and we haven't even gotten to the point where the poster above got frustrated. I've never gone on Amazon to give a review but this thing is such a piece of trash I can't have another parent go through it.l"

3,Wasn't as I had expected,"I purchased these pulls for my mother-in-law for Christmas. They were supposed to be here by the 23rd of December but didn't get here until the 27th. They are 4"" pulls which is what I needed, however the holes for the screws aren't at the ends, so they didn't fit her cabinets. I have called 3 times now and they keep promising someone will return my call, however it is the 2nd week of January, and no one has called me back yet. The product is great for the money if it were the right size, but the customer service is terrible."
4,"Nice player, but no USB Port or VGA Output","I really liked this player, but it doesn't have the advertised USB Port or VGA Output. I had great plans for the VGA Output....lolBut it is a nice player for the price, I have played several DVDs without a hitch. It looks nice and comes with a digital display, which is unheard of in a player of this price range.So even though it didn't have VGA Output; the primary reason I chose this unit. I still liked it enough to give it 4 Stars."
5,Excellent value for the price!,"I was pleasantly surprised with the features this player has considering the economical price. I have only played DVD-R and DVD+R discs and the response time for loading and its ability to start/play the movie have been extremely fast. I like the built in counter/display, which is very useful for monitoring the progress of your movie and this is definitely omitted by other ""low end"" players. Even though the loading tray doesn't come all the way out, most users shouldn't have a problem with it. I don't have a single complaint with the remote that has worked perfect so far. The design of the player seems to be of good quality and I love its size. My only concern is the durability of the player in terms of longevity. Only time will tell."
1,The player is not region free,"The player beeing sold in the USA has been modified, so it cannot play other regions (except region 1 and 0). This player is not hackable. If you want play DVDs from other regions DON'T buy this player. There are many other players that have DVD region hacks."
3,Product description is all wrong!,I bought 3 of them thinking to use them as my WMA player thoughout my house. The product description is wrong. The player does not support WMA playback nor does it have a VGA output nor does it have a USB port. I will be keeping these units since it does playback any DVD+-R media I throw at it.
3,Not a review - just a question,"this is a question. i couldnt find anywhere else to ask it. if anyone knows please tell me. is it possible to connect this dvd player to a computer? maybe by buying an extra cable, etc. please help!"
2,Also missing 5.1 analog outputs,Don't buy this dvd player looking for the (6) 5.1 RCA analog outputs.
1,Another one that died young,"It worked great while it lasted, but just after the 90 day warranty expired, it stopped showing any picture on the coaxial output (you can still hear the sound), and the SVHS output is now black and white. I don't have any monitor capable of displaying the component output, so I can't say if that method is also affected. Given that the warranty is so short, and that the little money I spent for it is now a complete waste because of the short warranty, I wouldn't buy another of these."
3,Still works - but.....,"Bought it last year (March 05) and so far I have no problems in playing DVDs. But anything else - it will choke. VCDs, Audio CDs etc the unit will freeze for few seconds after every 20seconds of playing. These CDs are playing well in other DVD/CD players.It could be a firmware issue - I am searching for updates now.-BB22"
4,good value for the money,"Bought this as a 2nd dvd player for a 2nd TV. Wanted something inexpensive ($25 after rebate!). So far so good, although after reading some of the other reviews I probably shouldn't get too comfortable with it. Picture quality is good and has enough features to get the job done. Only complaint is the remote -- very tiny buttons that are hard to access and are not well-labeled."
1,avoid malata,i purchaced a malata dvd player/home theater back in 2004. we had to send it in for repair twice and returned several speakers that failed. the second time we sent in our unit for repair they did not send it back. it has been almost three years since we sent it in the second time. if you want a dvd player that will work and has a good company that will back it up do not buy a Malata unit.
5,A shocking and fascinating account,"Cointelpro by Nelson Blackstock is a close and penetrating look at the illegal FBI counterintelligence program code-named COINTELPRO. Brought to light by a lawsuit filed in 1973 and settled thirteen years later, the COINTELPRO program, its methods for political disruption, techniques used by the FBI, CIA, and military intelligence, are all covered in-depth in this shocking and fascinating account. Enhanced with an introduction by Noam Chomsky, Cointelpro is especially timely reading in view of the radical measures being passed into law and implemented under the aegis of Homeland Security."
3,Golf Putting Practice,"Although the other comments i read were saying that this was bad i disagree. The mat did have to be flattened out with some heavy textbooks and some weights and after a few hours it was good. The only real problem is that when it shoots the ball back the mechanism moves in the opposite direction. Luckily, with two 10 pound weights to support it, it works great. So, my overall impression of this product is great because it was cheap and serves its purpose."

5,If only I could give it 10 stars!!! Hilarious!!!,These two are so awesomely hilarious together... Why did they stop?! This show was/remains one of our favorite comedies.The funny never stops in these. This is one of our favorite episodes. T-bones is just over the top funny & Naked trucker is the perfect straight (comedically speaking) guy for his hilariousness. My family and I never get tired of the Naked Trucker & T-bones... Never. We love to laugh & this is a laugh a second.I wish they would get together and make more if this show! AWESOMELY FUNNY!!!
5,A GREAT READ,This book was my first Maeve Binchy and thoroughly enjoyed. The individuality of the characters was exceptionally told and one felt as though they were best friends by the end of the book.
1,"Same Binchy stories, no ending","I used to enjoy Maeve Binchy's books, but I now find them so similar that it's nearly impossible to tell them apart. This book had the same hapless losers, frustrated lovers of married men, drunk mothers, penny-pinching spinsters, and smug housewives as all of her books. They muddle about riding the bus back and forth to their little village and living their strangely intertwined but not very interesting lives - and then, suddenly, the book is over. What was the point? A waste of time."
4,Wonderful series of character sketches,"If you're expecting a novel like Echoes or Tara Road, don't buy this book. If, on the other hand, you admire Maeve Binchy's ability to tell you all about a character's life, personality, interests and dreams in a few pages, then this is the book for you. The Lilac Bus is a series of 'postcards' or brief character sketches of a number of different people, all of whom travel home from Dublin each Friday evening on the same bus. Each has their own preoccupations and concerns, and Binchy manages to give us some fascinating insights into not only the individuals here, but into the tight little society to where they're travelling, with its own mores and habits."
3,"Good, but not one of Binchey's best!","The characters are interesting and real. However, just as you really get to know each one and how their lives intertwine, you're left hanging in the end. I felt like I was taken to the edge of a cliff and then left there dangling!!!! The extra stories at the the end were disjointed and totally useless!!!!!"
2,Hanging,"I just finished Lilac Bus on my Kindle and thought there was a problem with the book not being downloaded correctly.So, I decided to read the reviews and yes it did download correctly. This book leaves you hanging, it ends abruptly. I loved the characters but don't waste your money on this book."
4,Gotta love Binchy,"I absolutely love anything and everything that Maeve Binchy writes. While The Lilac Bus isn't my favorite one of Binchy's books, it is rather enjoyable light reading. I find myself sucked into the mini stories that always manage to inner connect. Binchy is quite the story teller:)"
1,Boring,"This is the first Binchy book that I have read. I was very disappointed and unable to finish it. Expecting a story I got instead a bunch of character sketches, the only connection being their journey on the Lilac bus. Moreover each time a character became somewhat interesting her/his story would end. It seems as if the author was apprenticing her writing skills and this book came under 'how to write effective characters'. I do not recommend it. I might give Binchy another try, but it won't be too soon."
1,"Maeve leaves you hanging, and not in a good way","I want to start off by saying that I have enjoyed most of Maeve's books (my favorites being Tara Road, Evening Class and The Glass Lake), but this one I did not. The book is really a collection of short stories that are woven together, but not in any meaningful sense. Each chapter relates the story of a character, but at the end of the chapter you're waiting for more, waiting to make a connection with that character, waiting for the story to start. And still, at the end of the book you're wondering what the point was. It doesn't go anywhere. She tells you about the different people, but that's it, she just describes them and their histories. There is no plot, no climax, no closure."
1,Terrible,Awful book not up to authors standards. As if she didn't finish it. Nothing came together. Don't read this one.
2,Confusing for sure.,"After reading Minding Frankie which I loved, I decided to read The Lilac Bus. Although the characters were interesting, the only reason I finished it was in the hopes it would some how come together. It didn't. Not for me."
3,Village life,Loved the stories of the people who catch the Lilac bus on their weekly trip bringing the Dublin workers home from their work place to their small village.
1,Boring,"This book was boring. It's as if Maeve introduced the characters, but then decided against writing the story. It's very much like Minding Frankie in that there really isn't any story, just a few outlines of characters who have something in common, in this case, riding home from Dublin every Friday night.I miss the days where Maeve's books had actual stories, and while I loved the fact her characters were intertwined, and often appeared in more than one book, there was an actual plot."
3,Classic Binchy,"This book, a collection of interwoven short stories, follows a group of people who commute to and from their small Irish town to Dublin on the same bus. Though they spend a fair amount of time in one another's company, it quickly becomes clear that those travelling on the bus know very little of one another. As the story of each is revealed the reader learns that each character had significant problems and heartbreak.This formula is one that will be familiar to regular readers of Binchy's fiction. This is one of Binchy's early books, but she has used this formula in later books to great effect. There is something comfortable about Binchy, and the reader can slip into reading her easily. Binchy delivers here exactly what the reader has come to expect from her, and that's certainly not a bad thing."
4,Eight strangers on a bus,"Every Friday Tom Fitzgerald loads up his lilac-colored bus with 7 passengers that he takes from Dublin to Rathdoon. They chat amiably and harbor unspoken feelings about one another, but none of them really knows the others. Each of the passengers, and Tom himself, have secret lives which they wish to keep hidden from the others. In this book, Maeve Binchy uncovers all of these secrets and leaves us to ponder how little we really do know about those we see and chat with on a regular basis. Some of the secrets are noble, but some are not and there is a poignancy about each one. Following the ""Lilac Bus"" are four unrelated stories where Binchy weaves her magic with quickly sketched characters and plot. Some end a bit abruptly and leave the reader wanting more, but Binchy fans will probably want to include this in their reading."
3,Leaves you wanting much more,"Just finished reading The Lilac Bus and I must say I kind of feel like I wasted my time. The charaters are all interesting and nice to know about but it seemed like you were reading the first couple chapters of a book and then not being able to finish it to find out what else happened. The first eight storys do have a common link as they all ride the bus together the last four are just incomplete stories all their own. I have read many books by Maeve Binchy and have loved them all, but I'm sorry to say I wish I would have passed on this one. Maybe if your a fan of short stories you would like this."
2,What happened?!?,"This was my first experience with Maeve Binchy, and was almost my last. I was so angry when I finished the book! Ms. Binchy develops several characters separately (and very nicely) in different chapters and then leaves the reader hanging as to what the purpose of the book was. If you must, read the book as if it were a collection short stories and skip the useless last chapter."
1,What am I missing?,What am I missing? I like these bars but they cost $2.19 a box in the store. Why would I pay over almost $7 a box?
3,Glass is kind of wavey,"This cost alot less then the factory replacement and cost less then alot of junk yard replacement parts.The glass is a little wavey making your view alittle funky,but all in all a good item."
2,Worked well until it quit!,"I used this little printer/scanner/copier with pleasure for two years. Its quality and speed were very adequate for home use. I was greatly disappointed when it quit, indicating that it had a paper jam when no paper jam existed. HP telephone support repeated the steps offered on HP's website, and then tried to sell me a new or refurbished printer. No repair offered. My previous HP printer lasted about 10 years, so after this experience I'm now uneasy about buying an HP printer again."
5,Jackie is amazing!!,"I bought this video a few weeks ago, and I have not been able to start it unitl recently. WOW!! This is tough! Just as I had hoped it would be. Jackie's ""no bones, get off your a**, yes it hurts, DO IT ANYWAY"" method is truly what I need. I would recommend this video wholeheartedly and I plan to buy all of her other ones as well. I would kill to have her kick my a** for six months."
2,Disappointed,"Let me first say that I am a fan of Jackie. I love her Time Saver and Power Circuit Training DVDs. This really fell short of my expectations. The DVD gives two options: Standing Crunch-Free Abs, and Floor Crunch-Free Abs.The Standing segment was my biggest disappointment. I have tried this workout 3 different times and each time I don't feel like my core is getting the work out I want. The standing routine really works your legs with some really odd ab work thrown in.The Floor segment did work my abs, but I felt that it was more of a back routine that also tried to target the core. I am still looking for a great Ab workout. This DVD really did not deliver."
4,Good video.,Good video if your looking for some new ways to work the abs without doing typical crunches. Came fast. DVD was scratched pretty badly but it still played witout a hitch.
5,fantastic home workout,This has fast become one of my favorite workouts...very thorough and you can make it as difficult as you need to as you advance in strength...love it.
5,A workout!,"Great ab workout! I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to add to their workouts, some of my other videos that I have I feel don't do enough abs and I incorporate this video and it's perfect. Just the right amount of time to work out your abs. Try it, you won't be disappointed!"
5,LOVE JACKIE!!,This workout is so great! I have this one and her power circuit one. I do one on one day the the other the next day. Great for those who dont have hours to spare! Shes so adorable and fun. For sure works out your body amazing!!
4,fitness,This one is enjoyable and seems to be working. Only issue is that it's a bit hard on the knees.
2,Not for me,"I did this DVD and could feel it working in my abs and other parts of my body, but it's not for me. I had a car wreck many years ago and my right knee is bad from the wreck. The DVD had lunges in it which put a great strain on my knee. I'm sure the video will work well for others, but it's just not for me. :-)"
4,I've heard great things,"I have not tried this video as of yet but I've heard great things about it. My sister swears by it, it is her daily ab workout so if you don't like to work your abs in the gym, this is the way to go~!"
2,not all its hyped to be,"in watching the workouts, they look simple and practical...BUT, when i actually did them, especially the standing abs workout, i ended up in more pain that anything else as the positioning of the body was not normal at all...the floor workout was better in terms of comfort level but i lost interest after a while and now the DVD is catching dust on my shelf."
3,XTREME ABS,the standing abs is the better of the 2 workouts. i have some back issues so there are some of the moves i can't do on the 2nd workout.
5,Worth more than the asking price.,I can't say enough of this video. All her DVDs are great. I started with the extreme timesaver and I now own all her videos and her book. You see results in as little as 4 weeks. I didn't lose pounds at first. All I lost was inches. I went from size 7 to a size three with the extreme timesaver and only lost 7 pounds. The ab workout was great. You really feel your abs worked the next days
3,"Good for heart, useless for abs","I just started really taking abs training seriously a month ago, and already the floor abs routine is far too easy. The standing routine was a waste of time for me, but for those just getting into exercising for the first time, would probably be very beneficial. The floor routine did get my heart rate up and make me sweat, but so does jogging, and I bought this for ab work, not cardio. Three stars because this is a great tape for true beginners, not so much for intermediates."
5,well pleased great workout,"this is exactly what i needed a workout with intensity in a short period of time and see results along with proper diet its definitely a winner, would highly recommend ."
5,excellent workout,"This DVD consists of two 15 min workouts, one standing and one on the floor. The standing one is sort of medium tough, the floor one is very tough but also quite effective."
4,It works you,"I really like the standing routine. The floor routine I find really hard! I did both the other day and was crazy sweating! I wish she would come out with another one, so I could have more workouts!"
3,extreme???,I'm not sure I would title this video extreme abs but a change up for the ab workout for sure. not my favorite ab video.
5,ABSolutely INCREDIBLE!!,"This workout is definitely tough, especially the floor exercises but amazing. There is something Jackie says that has never been more true of how Im starting to feel about my abs, Hate me now, love me later... And not only do I LOVE her, but I'm also starting to love my abs as well. I've wanted flat abs for YEARS and have tried yoga, pilates, etc. Nothing was giving me the results I wanted, until I tried this. Although I don't want the abs that Jackie has, she is giving me the abs I want."
5,Best ab workout ever!,"I have bought and tried many workout videos and equipment in my days...and this one by far is the best. After the first workout, I could feel the burn (good pain) in my abs and surrounding areas. And there are 2 different workouts (floor or standing) that are only about 15 mins each. So you can do one quick workout in 15 mins or both in less than 30 mins. I mean how awesome is that? And again - it's an amazing workout. Yes, you will sweat and yes, if you haven't worked out in a while - then it will be a little challenging; but I never wanted to quit and was shocked at how quickly the time/workout went by. Would HIGHLY recommend!"
2,Be careful of your back!!!!,"(not Joe, but his wife) Okay, I'm a Jillian Michaels fan and I have several of her videos. I work out four times a week, and two of those are Jillian videos. So I thought I could handle this Jackie Warner abs one...but there is no attention to form and I ended up throwing my back out doing the standing series! There are a lot of fast jerky movements swinging a weight around (and I only used a 3 lb weight), and I have been in pain for two days. As long as I have done Jillian videos, I have NEVER had a problem like this--I get sore, but not in pain :( Be very careful before you purchase this video! As for me, I will stick with Jillian Michaels!"
5,DVD Workout (Jackie Warner),"I did tot know what to expect form this DVD by Jackie Warner, but it is a terrific exercise DVD! Broken down into three segments (Upper Body, Lower Body, Core) each segment is about 20 minutes long. One segment can be enough for a workout by itself, or the segments can be combined for a longer, more intense workout. My only negative comment is that it would be nice to not have to listen to the Bravo commercial each time the DVD is started. But that aside, this is a DVD well worth its price for those who want to get into, or stay, in shape, especially in the winter months. I liked it so much, I bought a second to take with me when I travel."
1,Company Scam,"This company provides a decent product but their marketing is a scam.When ordering the first DVD's the customer is ""automatically"" (translation- without authorization) signed up for continued shipments of DVDs whichare debited from their credit card account. Attempting to get the companyto stop this is futile. The customer has to continually contact their cardcompany to keep reversing the charges or close out their card. Becausethis must be some type of legal loophole, the government will not stopthis fraud. Consumers beware!!"
1,Disappointing,I was disappointed only because the DVD did not play!!! After reading all the great reviews I was really psyched to try it out as this was my first Jackie DVD...and it did not play at all. Just extremely disappointed in this purchase.
1,Scientific Explorer's Ice Cream Science Kit,"I would have liked to know what is included in this product before I purchased it - it was disappointing that the whole thing was just a set of instructions that I could have looked up on Google for free. The whole 'ice cream science kit' consisted of a couple of miniature plastic bottles of low grade syrup, some plastic Ziploc bags and a plastic measuring scoop. There is no kit really... just a set of instructions."
4,This kit is fun but can be a lot of work,"A fun (and tasty) Ice Cream Kit! After learning about ice and the importance of salt, kids can use this kit to invent their own flavors and colors of ice cream that they can make themselves, using a t-shirt as the ice cream machine. This kit also contains a 10-page educational ice cream making guide that is very helpful and actually is a bit humorous. For example, on the list for other ""milk"" products, this guide says ""Fish? Yuck! But there's no such thing. Fish are not mammals.""I received this item complimentary in exchange for an honest review. The opinion in this review is all mine."
4,Brass Rosette,"I like the quality and look of the product, and the price was reasonable. I would have givenit five stars, and liked it much more if it was made in USA, as apposed to China."
3,Iggy Pop - 'American Caesar' (Virgin) 3 1/2 stars,"Decent 1993 effort by the Igster. Follow-up to his 'Brick By Brick' disc. This is actually my first time I've ever heard this CD. Notice it's dark, loud and heavy - which of course I liked. Tunes here I was most impressed with was ""Wild America"", ""Mixing The Colors"", the rocker ""Plastic & Concrete"", his tribute (I assume) to teenage sexual frustration ""F**kin' Alone"" and the old Kingsmen nugget ""Louie Louie"". Not his best cover I've heard him do."
2,I don't know..,American Caesar is ok. Its better than Iggy's Bowie/Glam/ New Wave junk..But its not Iggy at his best. For that we have to look back to his Stooges RAW POWER days or ahead to 2001 to BEAT EM UP. I think Iggy needs to be pissed off to write his best songs. American Caesar just sounds kinda bland. Best tracks: Sickness and Hate.
3,MORE RAW POWER,"... If you like the rougher, rawer side of Iggy - think Fun House era Stooges - you will get a kick out of American Caesar. Great loud distorted guitar throughout. Like most of Iggy's solo material, its an uneven platter, but the good outweighs the bad on this hard hitter. Three and a half stars I say - would be a solid four but the lyrics sometimes delve into the moronic."
5,"hahahaha, thow them to the Lions!!!!",I saw Iggy on this tour at the Warfield. His energy and self abuse never cease to amaze me. Very few artists actually live the torture they sing about. It's why Iggy continues to be so vital.
2,"Good lord, do a little research.","This is a halfway decent product, but those who made it should at least be aware that there was no ""Kareem Abdul-Jabbar"" at UCLA and make the product and the packaging accordingly. He still went by Lew Alcindor. Having a card from his UCLA days with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar emblazoned across it is pretty pathetic."
3,Hundred Acre Wood Gang.,"Surprisingly these three movies bring up the question of tolerance. Piglet is looked down upon initally for his small size. The Tigger Movie shows Tigger's initial pride in being the ""Best Thing About TIggers"" (supposing that he's the only one). But then he begins to mope as his friends don't seem to be as manically into bouncing about as he is.Pooh's Heffalump movie is perhaps the best of the bunch. The elder animals become frightened of a loud noise they hear at night. Roo, Kanga's son, thinks the noise is cool. So having made provisions, the elder animals go on an expedition to catch the Heffalump. (Hilariously, it falls upon Eeyore to carry most of the luggage and so he must shoulder a pack the size of a house.) Roo ofcourse finds the Heffalump first, well atleast a younger version of one anyway. This is a first for fans: in all the history of the TV show and movies, we've never before been granted the opportunity to meet a heffalump. And ""Lumpy"" doesn't disappoint."
3,Wrong title,"This DVD consists of a compilation of film from Germany during 1918-1933. It's an OK DVD, but a more descriptive title for it would be ""Life in Germany 1918-1933."" Only part of the film deals with Hitler and the Nazis. Much of it is just the daily activities of Germans during that period. There is no narration. There are English subtitles for any German that is spoken. The audio does not always match the video, not particularly a surprise since much of the film was shot prior to sound in movies.I spotted only one error: the film says that Hitler was the editor of the party newspaper, ""Völkischer Beobachter."" Not true. Hitler owned the paper, but its most famous editor was Alfred Rosenberg.So buy this DVD to get an idea of life in Germany in the 1920s, but don't expect a narrative about the Nazi rise to power."
3,Home Movies of the Nazi Movement,"This is sort of a home-movie compilation of the Nazi's rise to power. For the most part, it's not terribly interesting or compelling. More editing would have helped get the message across, but if you're just interested in seeing old footage of people rallying in the streets during this period, then this might be ok."
1,Don't waste your money.,"When I got this tool set I wanted each tool so I could have a set, not just an all in one tool so I spent the extra money. I was happy it appeared to be a good set, until I started sleeving my power supply, very quickly found out the pin removal tweezers are worthless and broke after I had changed 4 pins, the 5th pin inserted fine had to use some pressure to pop the pins out and snap........ very cheap metal, a better quality metal would have flexed some and not just broke... Just save your money and go get the all in one tool, http://www.amazon.com/Lisle-56500-Terminal-Tool/dp/B0009OR906/ref=pd_sim_t_3 it is a much better quality tool and costs less."
3,Simple Vase,"I wouldn't spend more than the $1.00 I paid for it, its kinda cheaply made, and I don't know if I'm gonna chance putting any water in it to wash away the color, but its a nice bright centerpiece. Got some blue and green and red ones and they are a nice colorful addition to my apartment."
5,Still The Best!!,"Who can say more about Sherlock Homes? Except that he still remains one of the most fascinating characters in the annals of fiction (with the possible exception of ""The Sea Wolf"" by Jack London). And his latest portrayer, Jeremy Brett, in the PBS series, is just dead-on. He is a joy to watch after you've read the real thing. Why Watson is as old as he is is a mystery, however, as in Doyle's stories he is quite a young man, being at most no more than thirty-five, and in most of the tales, married, and living apart from Holmes. My book had 612 pages, and a page-turner til the last. Especially great to read over the holidays when time is at a premium, and no story is very long. Easy to pick up and put down. The stories are not in the least dated, and if you think that, you are sorely mistaken. A good mystery is a good mystery, in any century. No serious reader should be without Holmes in his collection."
4,A real eye-opener into the workings of the judiciary,"This book gives a strong indictment to the recent changes in the court procedures and focus of our legal system. Judge Rothwax succinctly details where we've gone wrong and how to fix it. The remedies are controversial. Even if you disagree with his suggestions, I wholeheartedly recommend this book to everyone interested in our legal system."
1,Dont waste your time,"I bought this hoping to actually be able to listen to the music! I followed all of the instructions on the set up list and no sound whatsoever came out. The AC adapter fits into the DC port crookedly at an angle. The remote control did not work and once I did get the power button to turn on, it turned right back off again. Dont waste your time ordering this."
2,where is tao liang tan?,"i bought this movie cuz i thought tao liang tan is gonne be the leading role but instead the movie waste alot of long scenes with the corny servant and mistress. The movie should have focus more of tao liang tan, his school, and his rival school enemies. A big dissapointment to this movie with the director wasting a talented actor. The only good thing about the movie is tao liang tan and his rival enemies."
5,leg fighters,if you want a action packed kung fu movie this is it great fight scenes you have the high kicker hero against the ground kicker villian amazing fight scenes the ending is classic if you dont buy this you need a leg kick in the head and are not a kung fu fan.
1,"It's true, partly","I happen to know the first man on the moon: the guy is now a janitor in a pool hall in Birmingham Alabama, in total obscurity.Why didn't the author even interview this guy?He's in on it. It never stops."
1,Scientific nonsense,"Though having been sympathetic to the idea behind the book at first, I cannot recommend wasting your money on such scientific nonsense. Obviously both authors have no scientific or engineering background whatsoever, and it shows throughout the whole book.Sadly, the book failed to convince me that Apollo's moon landing was merely a hoax."
1,Junk,Looked interesting but read more like the ramblings of a schizophrenic. The author's own qualifications can be found on 568 - psychic since a child.
5,The definitive debunking of a worldwide myth,"You won't be able to put this book down. Amazingly well written, researched and objective. This book is the definitive debunking of perhaps the greatest lie in history. Every page is full of objective analysis on the subject, with all sides well represented. Useful highlighted sections, much like a textbook enable better absorption of key facts. Also many illustrations and photographs. The authors allow you to make your own conclusions about the material presented, rather than trying to push a conspiracy theory on you. A model of good writing and research. Simply stunning. Thank you David and Mary."
1,What's the point?,What's the point in buying this or any other publication relating to the Apollo Hoax? Every single argument can be found on the internet in greater detail with the added benefit of being able to find the counterarguments as well. Both sides of the issue are represented for free so why would you pay money for a book that only gives you one side?Buying this book is a waste of money.
1,Review comment,I do not recommend this book to anyone because there are too many unsubstantiated claims by the authors. Some are half truths and the rest are made up .
1,VERY SLOW SHIPPER,"Did not get this book until two weeks after lastest possiable arrival date. Bought it on the Dec 8th, was told book would get here no later than Dec 31. Got it Jan 11!!!"
4,Second Love,"I enjoyed the book very much, the problem came at the end. I felt the author was tired of writing the book and rushed the final chapters. I also found a few spots where the clues didn't jive. But I do look for these. Otherwise I truly enjoyed the book."
5,I like it!,"First off, if you are looking for a wood filler that won't be visible, especially if you are using a light stain, this certainly will stand out unless you do a lot of work with other stains to make it match. It worked just as the instructions say. It is very moldable after about 20 minutes. But, you can tell you have a bunch of wood filler if you are filling large voids."
2,Review,Great product to use as a wood filler. Dries rock hard.I was not impressed with the ability for the epoxy to take stain.
2,WOOD FILLER,"Doesn't dry as hard as i thought.Did not work for my application.I am sure there are good reviews for this product, just not right for what i needed to do."
5,Does the job,"Another reviewer said it spread like peanut butter . . . Let's make it health food store peanut butter that has been in the refrigerator for a week. Mixing it is a bit of a chore, but I really have no complaints with how the product works. I was able to use use the hardener on a section of seemingly hopelessly rotten bathroom floor, then use the wood epoxy to fill it in. I have another damaged wood project that I have been dreading. It will take possibly three of four of rotten wood stablizer kits. I would like to see them make their product in a larger size."
2,Not so Great,"I have used other wood patch products in the past with good results. This product, however, left me disatisfied. It is not very user friendly...tends to be difficult to apply. It does NOT go on smoothly or adhere well...requires a great deal of coaxing and smoothing. It dries quickly, often before you have managed to achieve the smooth application that you want in order to reduce the amount of sanding needed. I ended up just tossing it in the trash and buying another product that was easy to apply and gave me a great result. This product does harden and sand well, but it just isn't worth the time it takes when there are other products that apply and finish much easier."
4,Finally Stopped Runnin',"I found this collection of Pharcyde music videos and tid-bit interviews to be entertaining and infuriating. First and fore most, I must say that the quartetes music videos are indeed bizzare rides, full of witty lyrical energy and interesting conceptual premise. Many compilations (as this one) are fast ways for artists to cash-in on previous successes, but what seperates Cydeways from others is that it attemts to delve into what caused The Pharcyde to break up. Initially, the remaining trio (Tre-who has since left the group, Imani, boody brown) show little audacity towards fatlip for leaving but then they paint him as a red faced clown in one of the videos. Fatlip continues to embarrass himslef with his solo work ""worst case scenario"" which makes me suspect that he never wrote any of the lyrics on previous Pharcyde recordings. With all that said, I am still a fan of the Pharcyde and this DVD is a must have for any one who can say the same."
5,QUALITY COOKWARE!,"This set of Farberware cookware is quality. I love the ""strainer"" lids. No more need for a colander to drain pasta or vegies!!! I highly recommend this set. The seller sent out promptly. Everything perfect!"
3,"Great cup warmer, lousy switch",I've owned three of these and agree with many of the other reviewers - this one is just right..... until the switch breaks. It does this long before the sturdy heating element gives out. I've just taken apart the non-operative switch on my most recently purchased unit and found that a small plastic tab inside it had broken off. Can't fix it. I'll think twice before buying another one.
5,A Mug Warmer That Actually Works!,"I've used other warmers that just don't live up to expectations, but this unit is great. The switch is now close to the warmer, so no lifting the wire or crawling under your desk to unplug it or find the switch to turn it off. It will NOT heat your coffee or cup-a-soup, but it WILL keep them nice and drinkably warm. I know. My office, (The Dungeon) was stinkin' cold!Highly recommended!"
2,Meh,I was hoping that it would be warmer than the super cheap candle warmer that I had. No dice. I am still looking for a mug warmer that will actually keep my tea above lukewarm.
4,Works very well,"I have had one for about 2 years and it works better than others I have tried. After 2 years the switch is getting a little finicky, requiring a little jiggling to engage sometimes. Not bad enough to prevent me from buying 2 more!"
5,Revolutionized my morning (and afternoon) coffee drinking,"This cup warmer is totally amazing. I had been struggling with a several year old cup warmer that felt hot to the touch but was only keeping my coffee lukewarm. With this new one, the first sip is still piping hot almost an hour after buying a grande starbucks coffee. I would highly recommend this to other users. I know some people complained about the on/off switch not being directly on the device, but frankly I wouldn't want to be touching the device while it's on and the switch is no more than 6 inches from the base. Enjoy!"
4,BETTER THAN MOST,"Before purchasing the NorPro beverage warmer, I had purchased one made by Totes to replace a warmer that I had used for over 10 years. My old warmer was great and always kept my coffee hot. The Totes beverage warmer barely kept my coffee lukewarm and I returned it. After doing some research, I bought the NorPro. It does a fairly decent job but it doesn't keep my coffee as hot as my old one did. I think that manufacturers are concerned with the possibility of people getting burned while using these warmers and therefore keep them from being too hot. This warmer looks nice, has a large cup area and the base is attractive with a marbled design. However, the on/off switch is on the cord, about two inches from the base, which I find a bit inconvenient. It would have been better to have the switch right on the warmer itself. All in all, this is a good product for the money."
3,"Warm, not hot. Strange pattern.",It meets the basic needs of a cup warmer but here are a few things I'd want them to address if they were to create v2.0:1. It doesn't keep my beverage hot until I get down to the last 30% (so drink quickly at first and then go slow)2. Difficult to tell if the light is on in a well-lit room3. The funky white stone pattern doesn't match anything you'd find on a typical office desk. I didn't realize how much it stood out until I had it on my desk.
3,"Warms great, but be aware of the following...","This warmer works very well in the ""warming"" department, but before purchasing, be aware of the following:- the cord is very short, so you will probably need an extension cord.- the on/off switch is located half way down the cord, so you have to reach for it a bit... It would be much better if the on/off switch was on the warmer unit itself.- the bottom ""feet"" are made of hard plastic, so it ""slides"" on hard surfaces and can scratch your furniture. It would be much better if it had rubber feet.Other than that, it's a nice product."
5,Cup Warmer - awsome,"I previously had revewied this product. It had arrived late and a bit defective but it worked great. Low and behold, and much to my suprise, the company had read my review and within days, sent a replacement with their apologies. This one was perfect and I use it all day long. Keeps my coffee hot, hot, hot. I am bowled over by a company who cares so much that they read their own customers' reviews and act upon any negatives. They get a TEN in my book. Great cup warmer. I recommend highly!"
4,Almost perfect,Very nice. Only possible complaint is the switch which is in line. Would prefer to have a swith on the unit. Would not hesitate to buy another.
2,Norpro Coffee Connoisseur Electric Cup Warmer,This product barely keeps coffee warm. It`s no more than a candlewarmer. I`m sorry I wasted my money on it.
3,OK but not Great,"I have had the Cozy Cup Warmer for at least 5 months. This is my 2nd one. The 1st didn't last but a day. Short cord, dog, floor, shattered exterior.The short cord and positioning of the on/off switch is very inconvenient.I do not like my coffee lukewarm. It doesn't get quite hot enough for my taste.Also the thicker the bottom of your mug the less warm the liquid.I am still on the look out for a warmer that has a temp control!"
4,Warm Enough,"I did some experimenting with cup sizes, actually cup weights. If you use a big fat ceramic mug on this thing, your coffee will be less warm. I found that using a lighter cup that weighed 7 or 8 ounces was a good match for the amount of heat generated by this unit; keeps the coffee nice and warm. If you have a big mug, you might try another brand that produces more heat. But beware, a hotter element is more dangerous as far as the potential for burning a finger or hand. So I decided to err on the side of a smaller/lighter cup and am satisfied with the results."
2,Not that hot...,"Everyone talks about it being so much bigger and hotter but I honestly don't think it is any hotter than the old one I replaced with it. After a little bit, the coffee is no longer hot rather just warm. The light is a little hard to see but no big deal. Reviews about cord length and switch are no problem. Cord is plenty long and line switch is close enough to the unit to be convenient. It is well made. The finish is goofy looking but who cares. (A classic black would be nicer). Biggest disappointment. It does not keep coffee HOT. Just warm."
5,Beyond 5 stars,"Great cup warmer in design and function. Cord is not shorter than expected as one reviewer mentioned. Switch is on cord but still very close to unit's base, so it remains convenient. It warms up instantly. A&L International knocked my socks off with its amazing customer service. I had the product delivered the next day after I placed order with Amazon. The A & L letter explained its mission to earn a 5 star feedback rating from every customer. Consider that a ""mission accomplished"" with this customer as I would gladly give A&L International a 10 star review."
4,A nice heavy duty appliance,"This is a gift for Dad who sips coffee as day long. Seems to work well. However, be careful not to put your finger on the metal screw on the bottom when the unit is heated up--it burned a little blister on my finger!"
5,Warmer than most,I've had lots of mug warmers. The Rival that I can no longer find was the best at keeping thick mugs warm but this Norpro is good. I like the thick base and the amount of clearance from the desktop.
5,Nice hot cup of coffee,"This coffee warmer is very efficient. My cup does not have a flat bottom, and it works great. Be careful though, as it is ceramic, and therefore breakable. This is my second one, it's a tad pricier than the others, but worth it. Looks classy too, so you can put it anywhere."
1,Big disappointment,"I'm one of the many people who miss the Dazey warmer--it actually kept your coffee drinkably hot. This one, at 24 watts (the Dazey was 25 watts), was very encouraging. Unfortunately, it works no better than the ""candle warmers"" at keeping anything hot. I think it might actually work if the heating elements were in the center where the cup sits, but instead they seem to be curled out in the sides of the warmer. The sides get hot, but the part under my cup, not so much."
3,Product Base unique /cheap overall,"I bought it based on the Vermont Country Store description that it had a ceramic base.Seems to work about the same as all the rest of ones on the market.Needs a brighter ""on"" light.Warming plate not 100% seamless (indentation in middle) The whole unit gets hot (and underneath), but at least it doesn't emit a hot plastic smell after initial break in. You'll need to put a saucer/lid on the top of your cup if you're a slow drinker like me. Use some non slip pads to prevent sliding, be careful about the surface you place it on as it will heat it up. I hate the on/off switch on the cord (its a wheel switch instead of a button). Also the non stick coating is the worlds thinnest as it comes off even when cleaning with a non-abrasive sponge. Ok for the $."
2,I guess this is why it's called a coffee warmer and not a coffee hotter.,"I've had this warmer for nine months. It's an okay coffee warmer, but it's far from perfect. The main issue is that coffee is not kept very hot. Sure, the coffee's not cold, either, but I keep on longing for a hotter cup of coffee. The switch position doesn't bother me since I have the unit on a motion sensor device that automatically shuts off if no movement is detected in the room. The red light indicating that the device is on is far too dim to be easily discerned in bright conditions.I would not buy this again."
2,A bit disapointing,"In viewing the product, I thought the warmer also came with the cup... as most coffee warmers do. The cup was actually the selling point; so, I what I thought I ordered was different than the actual which was only warmer itself. It's a shame, the cup displayed is beautiful. Oh well, live and learn."
4,Coll Stuff!,"The only thing I could complain is that the lane is still too short for me. So I can't see the red light at all. I just wish that they could put an indicator at the switch, so then I could tell whether the warmer is on or off.But after all, it helps me to warm my hands. I can't live without it now."
4,Good,"Does well to keep coffee warm enough. Looks nice, not like a run of the mill warmer. Use quite often."
2,Luke Warm At Best,"I love my Dazey 1400 and wanted a mug warmer to keep in the living room. I was excited when I noticed this one puts out 24 Watts. Unfortunately, it kept my coffee luke warm at best. I like my coffee between warm and hot and the Dazey does just that, but this one does not.All my mugs are concave on the bottom so they don't lie flat (I don't think I've ever seen any flat-bottomed mugs). The edge of the mug sits directly on the surface so even though this warmer generates enough heat it does not transfer well. It's why the Dazey shines with the slight groove on the perimiter."
4,Worth the money,"If you keep hot tea/coffee mug on it, it remains hot. What else one wants? Some reviewers said that the on off button is in midway of the wire. That's not correct. the on-off switch is around 6 inches from the warmer.Pros: plate does get HOTCons; LED could have been better. Sometimes it is not clear whether it is on or off, without touching the plate ;-)Summary: Buy it."
3,"Came as ordered, but.......","Came as pictured, but doesn't keep drinks that hot and the ""on"" indicator light is almost impossible to see if it is on or off, unless the room is completely dark. This item needs to be re-designed to allow more heated plate and a much better indicator light."
2,Just so-so,I ordered this item for my Husband who likes to work in the garage. The garage is in the 50 degree range a lot of the Winter. This cup warmer is not meant to be used in a cold garage. It only keeps the coffee luke warm. It might work inside a house where it's warmer. If I had bought the product in a local store and not on line I would probably take it back. Too bad. The reviews looked promising.
2,disappointed,It doesn't work as advertised. Barely keeps the coffee warm. The one it replaced worked just as well and it was 15 years old.
4,coffee warmer,"I found the coffee cup warmer to be as advertised. It would be better if it kept the cup hotter, but it is adequate. It arrived promptly in the mail with no damage at all."
5,So far so good...,"Product works just as described, keeps my coffee warm for hours! Shipping was kind of expensive, but it was worth it."
3,Almost hot enough,"Although it keeps a cup of coffee hotter than the Mr Coffee warmer, there are warmers that can maintain the temperature of the cup being used. A typical cup of coffee or tea will gradually decrease in temperature in less than 10 minutes. It's just OK."
3,so-so,"The surface area does get very hot, but it's not very efficient at keeping a whole cup of a beverage hot. It works best for flat bottomed cups."
2,Norpro Coffee Cup Warmer 5569,"According to advertising, this warmer is as good as the Dazey cup warmer which keeps our coffee hot. But I was extremely disappointed that it works just as badly as the Mr Coffee's cup warmer - keeps coffee or liquid only LUKEWARM. I called the seller who contacted Norpro on their second complaint in the week. The Norpro sales rep told the seller that Norpro 5569 only keeps coffee at 101 degrees while at use. The boiling point is 212 degrees. At least a cup warmer should keep coffee at 195 degrees temperature to make it drinkable as hot coffee. Dazey warmer is 25 watts and kept my coffee hot all the way thru. So many people are looking for a replacement of Dazey. If Norpro could work on the product and improve it, it will sell well, because I do like the larger size of the warmer plate."
1,doesn't work as expected,Electric Beverage WarmerThis is the second identical product purchased because I was satisfied with the first one. It was a mistake to assume that the second one would work as well as the first one. It did not ! It just barely warms the coffee even though I am using the same mug. It was made in China which might have something to do with its reliability.
5,Only cup warmer I've ever had that keeps my coffee hot to the last drop..,"This is the best cup warmer I've ever had! It keeps my coffee hot to the last drop. The base does get quite warm, but that's no problem."
2,Nothing to write home about,"No much of a warmer.I bought this because it has the highest wattage of almost everything. I was replacing my old Dazey warmer and this one really wasn't up to snuff. Not even close in warming.It will keep a cup of coffee just above room temperature but not warm by any means.It really heats up the table and the ceramic ring, too hot to touch. But the plate and cup are just warm. I think if the cup had a completely flat bottom you'd be OK, but they just don't make cups like that. They all only touch around the rim.I think we are just stuck with drinking our coffee fast or having it be cold."
5,As good as it gets,"It worked as good as I could have hoped. Short of plugging in my coffee cup itself, this is the best thing I could find to keep my coffee warm. It works perfectly for me. If there is a con it is that the light can be hard to see if it is on and the switch rotates so you can't look at it to see if it is on. Of course you can just feel the side and that will tell you."
2,not warm enough,"Like others, I like my old Dazey, which I purchased in 1994, and I'm having difficulty finding another one that works as well, with on-off switch on the unit, indicator light, and a temperature that is hot enough. Mr. Coffee failed the temperature test, so I ordered the Norpro. It failed as well, and I finally made an actual temperature comparison. The Dazey keeps the coffee at about 137-138 degrees (measured with an IR unit at about 12 inches), and the Norpro keeps the coffee at only 125-127 degrees under the same conditions. I sent the Norpro back."
4,Almost as good as the book!!!,"I bought this book just because the title caught my eye...I didn't even realize I was in the teen section! The book captured my heart and it was a nice surprise when the movie showcased the tenderness and heart of the book. This is a ""must have"" for anyone who is/has/wants a sister!"
3,better than the book!,"I thought this as a movie moves along a lot quicker than the story does in the book. Alexis's charecter seemed, to me, to have the most screen time. She's always so Gilmore Girl-ish. I don't think she'll have an easy time being recognized as a diverse actress. Amber Tamblyn was good in this movie, but her dramatic acting is better in Joan of Arcadia. Having never seen America Ferrera, or Blake before... I was very impressed with both of their acting abilities.I would also like to add that although this is better than the book, it is important to note that this is not the type of movie that is believable if you see it more than once!"
4,Worth a Watch,"Four best friends have grown up together. Over the summer they are going to be separated for the first time. One goes to South Carolina, one goes to Greece, one goes to Mexico and one stays at home in Maryland. Before they go their separate ways for the summer, they all go shopping together and notice a pair of jeans fit each of them perfectly. They decide that over the summer each girl will wear the pants for one week and then mail it to the other girl for a week.The girls come to transitional points in their lives over the summer. The scenery for South Carolina, Mexico and Greece is nice. The acting and story is good. I finally understood why some people get mad when their parents separate and one parent remarries into another family. I didn't think the movie was as deep as it could have been, the ""lessons learned"" seemed kind of simplistic. However, the movie was good overall and definitely worth a watch if you like drama or relationship situation movies."
3,Maybe I'm missing a chip,While children and teenagers do tend to do the weirdest thing sometimes--I just wasn't moved as much as the other reviewers for this movie. At best I can say it was o.k. There was nothing remarkable about two of the girls' journeies. I think the documentary story and the remarrying father were by far the most interesting --the other two just had me shrugging my shoulders thinking 'so what?'
2,Doesn't hold a candle to the book....,"If I hadn't read the books, then I probably would have liked this movie. However, I read all three books and this movie angered me at parts. I understand that you can't follow the book exactly, but completely changing how people meet or siblings of the girls who have very big parts in the story lines (i.e. Lena's sister Effie or Bree's brother) completely changes some aspects of the movie and the story. I would recommend this movie if you haven't read the books, but I would recommend more for you to read the three books, because they are incredible books."
1,Huge disappointment after the book,"As a huge lover of the book I was deeply disappointed in this horrible adaptation. The book was moving, very well written, and an experience you will always treasure. The movie completely changed the storyline and lost all of the magic. It was shallow, barely touching on the real issues. Please read the book and you will discover the true magic with Lena, Bridgette, Carmen, and Tibby. You will not be the same."
5,question..,"I'm reading these reviews and at least one said that Bridget is dealing with her mother's suicide. I know her mother died but where in the movie/in the book did it say she committed suicide? Please answer this. Thanks!Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants was by far the best movie ever!!!! go see it with your friends or mother/daughter. You wont be dissapointed! And girls, do something like this with YOUR friends too! it will definately be fun.Now get off your computer and go watch it!! lol"
5,Love the Pants movie!,I rember watching this movie i Really long time ago when i was 8 year old i think. all i rember was i ablutley adored it! <3Reading the book now. The book is really good so f ar.
4,well-constructed story,"To start off with, I am a middle-aged male. I want to praise the writers for the skill in coordinating four different stories. All sorts of the things could have gone wrong -- the audience could have gotten confused, or the stories could get repetitive, or some stories could have overwhelmed others. But they did it so well that it's unobtrusive. Also, having four good actresses with distinct personalties helped.My main complaint is the Bridget subplot. Probably because of the PG rating, the writers are reluctant to come out and say that she threw away her virginity on a guy that wasn't worth it; as a result her motives and feelings are pretty much a blur. You'd think Tibby was the one who suffered the most, experiencing the death of a loved one, yet Bridget monopolizes the group's sympathy without saying why."
3,SIMPLY AWESOME,"I highly reccomend this for the pre-adolescent and adolescent females in the household. There is some great life lessons to be learned about acceptance, first loves, and separation. Particular standouts are Amber Tamblyn and America Ferrara. I would have given it more stars if there weren't so many references to soccer."
2,well the girls are cute but there are so many things wrong here.,"Never mind the title which sounds like the Warner Brothers marketing department came up with it, this movie is so full of clitches and cheesy dialoge that you feel sorry for the girls, they seem cut out to be type cast in these rather lame movies."
5,Sadly I never did get this DVD,"I was credited quickly by the seller because the item was no longer in stock. Disappointed about not getting the film, but the seller was quick to take care of the issue."
2,Not for Guys this movie is very emotional...mostly depressing,"I would rate 2.5 as a chick flick. I usually like them, but not this one."
5,I loved it!!!,"Today I saw the Sisterhood of the Traveling pants and I loved it! I had read the book and loved it just as much.Yeah, a few things from the book were switched around a little bit in the movie, but it was still very good. You know sometimes when directors make books into movies, they usually suck but ones like Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter can be pulled off.And that is how Sisterhood is like. I would totally pay to see it again. I don't reccomend it to boys, because well, you know, it is more for a mother daughter thing, or a group of friends kind of movie. Overall, if you like chick flicks or have read the book, try it! You won't be dissapointed!"
3,It was good...,I liked it but there were tons of things that they left out in the movie.Mimi wasn't mentioned at all! They never said when Bailey died. Lena's grandmother hated Kostos in the movie!(For ones who read the book...)Read the book it's better than the movie.
5,it was fun see this movie.,"i realy enjoyed seeing sisterhood of traveling pants. i would recommend this movie to all girls ages 11-17. i read the book so i new what to expect but it was still very good. there is 1 seen with bayle that made everybody cry. (including me). the actresses are who I would have chosen to play lena, carman, tibby and briget. its such a girl movie. take your best friends and go see it."
1,This film ripped off Ray Bradbury's Wonderful Ice Cream Suit,"Hasn't anyone noticed that this film is a total ripoff of Ray Bradbury's short story and film ""Wonderful Ice Cream Suit""?Four men pitch in and buy a suit, take turns wearing it, and something magical happens to each one. Some originality, people!"
1,Sisterhood of the Traveling pants,"I never received this DVD from the company. I e-mailed on March 15th, 16th, and 18th and they responsed to the first e-mail on the 19th. They said it was being shipped and I still don't have the movie. Amazon returned me my money and I have purchased the movie else where. I would not recommend this company to anyone."
1,Cashing in on a bestseller,"This movie failed to capture the characters and spirit of the film. It either cut out or minimalized many important secondary characters. Storylines were changed into cliches. Blake Lively (Bridget) seemed to be afflicted with the illness known as ""overacting"". Alexis Bledel, America Ferrera, and Amber Tamblyn failed to bring genuinity to their roles, something I expected from these usually competent actresses. The girls seemed like a bunch of yapping, annoying teenagers.Very disappointing adaptation of a great book."
1,Not my kind of movie,"A big chick flick. Not a guy movie. I didnt want to see this movie, but my girlfriend wanted to see it so I said ok. I mean it was free cause I work at the movies so it doesnt matter. But I just really didnt like it. There were 2 or 3 funny moments that made me laugh but other than that I couldnt get into it. Also it turned into one of those depresing movies and I hate those type of movies. Amber Tamblyn, Alexis Bledel, Blake Lively(Bridget), Emily Tennant, and Nancy Travis are hot"
1,"Okay, Let Me Get This Straight. . .","Four girls share a single pair of jeans that they all had their periods in. How GROSS is that? Anyway, this movie isn't worth rushing out to see. Like, wait till it gets out on DVD or something."
5,Lovely!,"I hardly have time for TV, with school going on. It seems that is all I have time for! However, my parents rented the sisterhood of the traveling pants and I though hey, why not?!? I had heard about the movie from our ministers wife...she said she would like for me to watch it. Soooo with that in mind i did...last night!This movie is utterly amazing! It's about true friendship that will last forever! Those are the best kind of movies anyways....the ones that leave you feeling happy and wild! I love the sisterhood, it has everything your looking for...1. Adventure2 friendship3 LOTS of hot guys (that greek guy, whose real name is Michael Rady is just fiiine)4 and finally lovewatch this it's good!"
3,Not as good as the book...,I enjoyed this movie for the simple fact that it was based on the book. It was okay but I was disappointed that events were changed so dramatically. I just don't feel that it was necessary to change certain things.
5,LOVED IT!!!!,"I watched this movie for the first time last week and I cried and laughed. This movie is not just for young girls, I should know I'm 26. This is for women of all ages... this is a must see, I promise you'll adore it!"
5,A great movie,"I liked this movie very much. I already red thr three books and I think that the film's like the first book: there isn't much diffences. The story is the same, the carcters are like in the books.What I also liked is the subtitles: I'm french and I learn English but sometimes it is too hard to understand and you can read the subtitles, it helps you to understand everything.Tibby's "" suckumentary"" is funny, and the "" video commentary with Amber Tamblyn, America Ferrera and Alexis Bledel is a good idea to know how was the film's shooting, what do they think of it.I Loved it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Great gift idea,"I bought this for my girlfriend and she loved it. She laughed and cried. Although not appealing to me as a male, it was great for her and that's all that matters."
1,Should have been a Made for TV film,"The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants could have been a well acted, insightful movie about overcoming teenaged adversity. Coulda, woulda, shoulda. Instead, the movie has all the ingredients of a fairly decent TV movie, with plenty of pause spots for commercials.There are many reviews that describe the sub-plots of the four friends so they won't be reiterated here. In quick summary, the two emotional subplots are: parental void (deceased mother, absentee father) and fear of feeling (exposing the ""real me""). These are basic, western culture, female teen age issues, and are exploited to a heightened sentimental degree.The film isn't bad, its just that its targeted audience doesn't require good acting (see hospital bed scene), exceptional videography (entire movie), or meaningful dialogue for it to have some box office success. If it's a Friday night and your 15 year old daughter is bored, you could do worse than rent this film."
1,Sisterhood of traveling pants,"Regardless of high ratings by many people, this book is not appropriate for young readers due to too liberal sexuality remarks. My 12 year old daughter gave zero star after she read the book. I felt so bad as a parent for not having examined the book beforehand."
2,"cheesy cliches and ""lessons learned"" galore","AARGH! This movie reminded me of one of those ""ABC Afternoon Specials"" that used to run during the 80s---corny, heavy-handedly preachy, dreadfully predictable, and cloyingly feel-good TRIPE.The plot premise is actually not too bad: a group of longtime (girl)friends find a pair of jeans that somehow fits all 4 of them perfectly, and decide to share the jeans over the course of a summer.It would've made for a nice ""slice-of-life"" travelogue if we simply got to see how each of the 4 girls' summers went, but instead what we get is a horrific ""4 life lessons"" movie...we are spooned out 4 thick gooey tablespoons of ""life wisdom"" instead, watching how each of them ALL LEARNED *SOMETHING REALLY, REALLY IMPORTANT* this particular summer!Like, ewwwwwwwwwww!Like, gag me with a spoon!Like, shoot me puh-leeeez!"
4,Really enjoyed but not my favorite book,I loved this book. I had read the second book in the Seabrook Trilogy first(The Rake and the Wallflower). I thought that overall the book was great just wasn't as good as the next book.
2,Don't bother,"This book is not for the person who has been out practicing law for several years. It is probably somewhat helpful for those who realize that practicing law is not for them either while in law school or shortly afterward, but there are better resources out there. The book consists of some introductory material which says that if you don't like law or cannot find a decent legal job, you are not a ""loser,"" followed by a large collection of ""sample"" letters and resumes. You get the idea after one or two, but as this book really has nothing else to say, the many samples serve as redundant filler."
2,Loved Vol.1,"I don't know if my expectations were too high from my experiences with vol.1. All I do know is I wasn't satisfied with vol.2. It felt like something was missing...soul? I don't want to knock the concept. I love that and everything about what the first one represents. I hope the series continues. I will continue to support. You should, too."
2,Ugggh What Happened,Major SighI don't know -- I listened to the samples at the site and they didnt sound as professional as the original CD (which is still a rare gem to have).Most of the items on the new disc seem to be poorly produced (at least the beginnings) - they all sound like they were produced on a low quality keyboard.Some of the songs did get nicer after the intro.check out hiddenbeach.com to listen to the cuts and decide for yourselfill pass on this one for now
5,Unwrapped Vol. 2 - The REAL THING!,"WHEW-WEE!!! I can't believe they DID IT AGAIN!!! I was so entranced in my UNWRAPPED Vol. 1 (still bumpin' it!) that I was blind-sided with V2!!! My karate instructor was so broken up about someone stealing his Vol. 1, he asked me to copy mine for him. When I told him Vol. 2 was out, he was like, ""Whoa!, I was really stuck on #1, now they have a Vol. 2???"" Why stop there Hidden Beach, Bring on Vol. 3, and 4, and 5..."
2,Definitely not as good as the first,"I loved Vol. 1; however, this one is not even worth buying. Very disappointing."
3,Doesn't Come Close To Volume 1,"Just bought it. Listened to it twice. If you never heard Volume 1, you would think this one was great. But, since I have Volume 1 and am a long time fan of hip-hop AND jazz, I must say that this was a bit disappointing. The song selection wasn't great and the synthesizer just totally takes away from the ""jazz"" sound. There was just a little too much of a ""fusion"" sound for me personally. Next time (because there will be one) Hidden Beach should take a little more time with song selection and give us more variety in terms of jazz musicians and instruments. This might as well have been Patrice Rushen's CD. Overall I would recommend this CD, there are some good tracks, but it's not one of those CDs that you can listen to all the way through without skipping a track. Better luck next time."
4,"Pretty Good, Jazz Element a bit More Stronger","This CD definitely has more of a jazz feel to it, than the Unwrapped #1. It's still tight, plus there's 2 CDs that I get!!!It's excellent!!!!"
3,It's Good not as Good as Volume 1,"My best tracks on this were ""Roll Out"", ""Summertime"" and ""Bouncing Back"". The others i could have done without.Although a copy cat album ""Streetwize"" which came out in 2002 is a little funkier."
2,High Expectations Were Dashed,"To be short and to the point, the second ""Unwrapped"" CD was a huge dissappointment. I probably had unrealistic expectations, based on my love for the first volume (I can honestly say that I have played it more than any other CD I own in the past 12 months). The concept of mixing Hip-Hop with Jazz is a great ideal - anyone with any sense of music history would admit to the natural bond between the two genres. However, listening to this CD gives the impression that the powers-that-be at Hidden Beach were pressured to get a second CD out as soon as possible, to try to take advantage of the success of the first volume. As a result, this CD will probably turn off true fans of hip-hop, as well as jazz afficionados. Some of the arrangements are mediocre at best, which I think is the CD's biggest problem. I still hope Hidden Beach puts out a Volume III at some point (which they undoubetly will), but I hope they give the third CD the time and effort a CD of this type deserves."
5,Very helpful for getting your head in the right place.,"I bought this book early on in a mixed relationship, and I'm really glad I did. It definitely helped me shape my thoughts around the differences in origin with my boyfriend (we've been together a year and a half now). I didn't use it as a ""fix"" for a problem, just as a way to help me think things through. To believe that everything's going to be fine just because you're in love is a recipe for disaster, and this book will help to walk you through that. Plus, like someone else said, sometimes just hearing that you're not the only one going through it is the best help."
4,Excelent!!!,I bought this not only because I had to return the library one but I know I will need this on my bookshelf for later.The language and the advicing in this book are awesome for mixed matches.Shipping was very fast and the book is in excelent condition!!
3,OK,"This book is OK, however I feel that at times it is a little pessimistic. I would have liked to see more case studies."
2,Size,"This product is described as a WOMENS Blazer. We I received it and tried it on, the size suggest that it more for a teenager. When I closed the one and only button, it closed way too high, at my bust and the bottom sprung open too wide. They should make a better sizing chart. It's a nice jacket if I was about 13 or 14 years old."
3,Wear out quickly,"I put these in my wish list for last Christmas, and my husband bought them for me. I love them, they're beautiful, warm and comfortable and they fit good, but they wore out really quickly, which is a shame, because they cost so much. I'm still wearing them, just 7 months after getting them, but the heel on both slippers is all worn down to the stuffing material under the boiled wool covering. I doubt they'll still be in one piece come this Christmas. If you love them, but don't mind paying the money for something that isn't going to last too long, then these are for you!"
2,"Series started well, ends indifferently","_When the Changewinds Blow_ is probably my favorite of the Chalker novels, and overall I tend to like the Changewinds saga better than any of his other series (the Well of Souls possibly excepted). And even this last book shows the clever and realistic feel for politics that made the series so interesting. Unfortunately it gets caught up in the all-too-familiar Chalker flaws-- obsession with body transformations (even to the detriment of the plot), sexual slavery, and the role of women in relation to their body image."
3,lack of technical info,"lack of technical infowhat do you mean by saying that it's ""high quality stainless steel""? please be very specific and list whether it's 18/0, 18/8, 18/10 stainless steel.Since it's a bakeware, i need to know whether it leaks nickel or not"
2,DECEPTIVE ADD,"IN YOUR AD 2 PIE PANS ARE SHOWN AND THE TERM "" 2 NEW FROM 28.78 "" ARE USED GIVING THE IMPRESSION THERE ARETWO PIE PANS IN ONE ORDER. AMAZON HAS MADE THIS AD TO CONFUSE ITS CUSTOMERS. FOR A 40 BILLION DOLLAR COMPANYTHIS IS SHAMEFUL!!!Norpro 9-Inch Stainless Steel pie Pan"
3,it's a book,it's not like I had a choice in getting this book. I am just writing this review to clear it from my product review list.
2,nice book,"i actually think the book is pretty useful, more useful than not reading itthe problem is that it treats knowledge as some authoritarianism by mainstream scienceand that new theories must fit with the old onesif so, then how are the old theories supposed to be questioned like in in the physics field?helpful none the less"
1,Extremely Biased Viewpoint,"The author attempts to push the idea that science is everything. I agree, it is very a important part of research, but the constant digs against anyone who believes in a higher being are completely unwarranted. The author tries to make you feel like having any type of religious beliefs is wrong and it totally distracts from the whole point of the book. At the end of the semester, this book is going in the trash. His egotistical attitude is enough to drive anyone into the ground - which is where this book belongs."
4,How to think straight about psychology,"The book was affordable, had no highlights (wonderful) and in very good condition. It was also timely, which is very important."
5,Grow Dutch II,"Finally a video that shows what it is like in the coffee shops and growshops of Amsterdam. This video shows blow-by-blow how the Dutch grow such fine quality marijuana. Grow Dutch II not only has interviews with growers and smokers but even tells about the history of the Dutch policy. The music is fantastic with Third Eye Blind, Chrissie Hynde and the Pretenders and Herbal Nation. There's even a section about hashish. This is definitely the best video of its kind."
5,Shows why marijuana should be legal.,"This movie shows what happens when a common sense view is taken on marijuana. Seing the openness that the Dutch have and the bright clean coffee shops filled with happy smokers makes me want to move there. This should be required viewing for the DEA. There is also some good growing information and history. But, the best thing is that the production values are so high, this movie could play on any network and you wouldn't blink twice. I'd love to see a follow up that focused on Vancouver, as it sounds like they are taking the sane/Dutch approach."
3,"Okay book, but has errors.","Even though Jeffery Suddeth says you can download the code examples, his internet site no longer exists(you are taken to a generic website), so you cannot download any code. I sent him a couple of emails, but he never responded to them. No exercises are provided. A mediocre book as far as I am concerned."
5,right on the mark,"I'm on chapter 8 and totally enjoying this book. He did a Great job! It's totally on the mark. FWIW, I'm an experienced developer but new to C# and Visual Studio and while I have a fairly huge collection of books (because I live in a small town in Alaska and you can't check things out before you buy nor run down to your local book/computer store to pickup a reference) this is one of the few programming books I'm ever likely to read cover to cover.There are a few typos/errors, but they're readily discernable from the text and aren't likely to mislead you if you're paying attention to context."
5,Best Sounding Live Record From Bad Brains!,"I absolutely love this record because to me, it's one of their best sounding live records, and most of their early classics are on it. ""I & I Survive"" is a perfect example of Bad Brain's greatness in a live setting-they kill this song live. When I first bought it many years ago, I played it over and over and over...here, the Bad Brains were still in their prime and the band never sounded better. The final song, a cover of the Beatles tune ""DayTripper,"" is an absolute highlight. If you've never heard the Bad Brains in a live setting-this is THE CD to get... Highly Recommended!"
4,critics choice,"Fairfield Porter reared in Winnetka,educated at Harvard,art developed in New York City.F.Porter although known as a conservative carries weight as a critic. His visual point of view developed after travel and living in New York. He not only visited many artist's exhibits ,he got to know the artists themselves.Dekooning assented approval of this man's work. He writes as well as he paints . He considers his criticism superior to his paintings.His critticism has been forgotten ,but not his paintings.He is open minded in reviewing the art outporings of his last years. Unlike ,Robert Hughes who I think has a prejudice for things English,Porter had convictions about the value of art in a political context.From this book you learn that he was a committee communist. Not only has Porter ascended to the best figurative artist of recent history this book of criticism is one of the most valuable reviews of the art of his time."
5,Scruffy (aka The Tuesday Dog),"I also read this book when I was 12 and that was about 25 years ago. I cried like crazy all through it. I have always been a big animal lover and this story just accentuated that quality for me. This book was a real eye-opener for me in terms of what happens to unwanted animals and the hard lives that they lead. No living being should ever have to endure such things. After I read this book, I committed to adopting pets from the animal shelter. Jack Stonely dedicated the book to all the unwanted strays in the world and I am grateful that he was able to bring attention to such a difficult and sad problem with such a moving, poignant tale. I highly recommend this book even if you are sensitive. I've never forgotten it and you won't either."
5,Pleasantly surprised!,I was hesitant to buy this product because I didn't want my puppy smelling like baby powder (I really don't enjoy the smell of baby powder on/for anything). I bought this not knowing if I would like it but it smells soft and nice. The good smell doesn't go away as quick as other products and helps my puppy keep a fresh scent between baths. All I need is one spray for my yorkiepoo and she's set.
2,can you forcast with this book?,"This is a short, pamphlet book with 20-30 full page pictures of clouds, accompanied by technical information that would supposedly allow you to look at the sky and predict the weather. I don't think so. The weather wizards book discussed the progression of cloud formations and is a much better book for this purpose. I found this book to be at one too technical and too simple. Had the author placed the photographs in the order one typically observes the change from high to low to high, or warm cold warm, and discussed what is happening within these systems and how the clouds reflect that, this could have been much better."
4,Great for dieters on Atkins,I started using these syrups in my coffee when I went on the Atkins diet. It uses Splenda and taste pretty good. It doesn't have that syrupy after taste like a lot of these syrups. It's great if you're dieting & have a sweet tooth because it's carb-free. If I was more creative I could probably add the flavoring to other meals on my diet.
4,Great modern pen from Cross,"I collect and write with vintage pens, but I liked the design of the Medalist line from Cross. This pen is a looker, I will give it that. I equipped it with a Cross ink converter and the nib writes smoothly and indeed, it is a true American extra fine, as it's advertised (not the thicker, European extra fine). Being all metal, it's got some heft to it, overall a very elegant fountain pen for a reasonable price.A couple of downsides are that the cap is a little wobbly, and I fear that in time it might loosen up, and that the nib is gold plated and not solid gold, meaning that if you write with it long enough it will show some plating loss. But to be fair, it still deserves praise, it's a good pen overall - I have not regretted the purchase."
4,Great Classical Movies,The Pedro Infante movie collection will provide any family who likes the old classical Mexican movies with many hours of uninterrupted violence free family time. As I watched the movies one by one I could not help but to miss these great movies. The mostly white and and black movies are rich in sound and excellent quality and should be and excellent addition to any movie lover.
2,Zymos Topical Wipes,Didn't really care for them - they came somewhat dried out and were of no assistance for my dog.
5,not just for children,"After I read this book, I purchased 4 copies for my siblings as gifts, the Christmas after our mother died and our father was left alone on his farm.This is a deceptively simple story of hope and love, that touches the heart."
5,Perfect Children's Book,"How lovely to read a simply told and beautifully illustrated children's book. There is nothing commercial about this book, nothing planned by the PR people to make it fancy and salable as often happens in the large publishing houses. It is left alone, and it's natural and it's so refreshing to read something so pure.An old man lives alone on the edge of the woods and is a widower. A wild mare gets lost from its herd. It is almost Christmastime, very cold and snowy, with a dismal outlook for both mare and man.The illustrations are very striking, the text is well crafted, simple and the words are well chosen. What a perfect Christmas gift for any child. Above all, it is a message of hope."
5,Winter's Gift,"The story is excellent, I would recommend it to others, in fact..., I have. I so appreciate the fast service and delivery of my book. The book was received new and received in excellent condition."
5,Exquisite Christmas Eve Book,"This book is so well done, I could not finish it without tears. The illustrations are so well done and the story timeless. I sent it to my grand-daughter to be opened Christmas Eve. She and her mother loved it. An excellent choice for a horse lover of any age."
5,A wonderful tale of loss and hope,"What a heartwarming story! Beautiful illustrations, a wonderful tale of loss and hope during the season of hope. My grandsons, aged 3 and 5, loved the story, LOVED the pictures and made me read it twice again after the first reading. You don't need any more endorsement than that."
4,Shannon's Review,One character in this book was Molly McIntire. She does not like turnips. Her dad is in the war. She has two friends. She has no pets. Her dad was very funny. the most exciting part of this book was when Molly dumped her brother's underpants on his girlfriend. Because I did not know it was going to happen. It made me laugh. Molly and Ricky made up. They were happy.
3,"A very interesting book, but I prefer the other books.","A good book, but it could have been more creative. I think that the older American Girl dolls books are more authentic, realistic and entertaining. I think that Molly's is a very creative doll that was invented, but I love Kirsten, Josefina, Felicity, and Samantha the best!"
4,Meet Molly,"Meet Molly is a great book for students to get an inside about WWII without the gruesome ""war"" parts. The third to fifth grade girls would really enjoy this book and the series of American Girls. This historical fiction follows a series so students can learn more about the time period. Valerie Tripp allows readers to get involved in Molly's life, where dad is away and mom is working. Home is not the way it used to be. Valerie Tripp uses real information to verification on the time period. Tripp lets the readers see that times were tough and Molly goes on with everyday life through the war time. The reader can envision himself/herself being Molly and dealing with older brothers and sisters as well. The description of the setting and activities is what makes the story so well."
4,Novel The Day Khrushchev Panicked,"This novel was one originally read shortly after it was published when the events described were recent history and the Cold War was far from over. Nakita Khrushchev was still in power in the Soviet Union and the whole novel was a skillful assembly of news events into a scenerio that seemed possible, even though pretty fantastic. I wanted to have a copy to re-read at this late date when the events have become rather remote with time and appreciate being able to find a copy of the book. It is now a better review of that time and circumstances than it is a good novel because science and the historical information made available by the end of the Cold War has made it read like the fiction that it really is. It is interesting and makes for a good read even at this late date."
3,alright is all i can say for this dvd,"this dvd has three episodes shining friendship and champion verse creator parts 1-2. shining friendship is about when yugi got defeated by kaiba mia came she was going to give him 8 star chips because he saved her for not being sent back to home because of a evil kreep on that island that takes other people`s star chips so tea dueled mia to get those star chips but at the end yugi got the 8 star chips. champion verse creator is about since kaiba defeated yugi he got to face pegasus so he dueled him but pegasus`s millennium eye can see all so once again pegasus won kaiba was trapped along with his brother and now its up to yugi to save mokuba,kaiba,and his grandfather. will yugi`s good gaming skills lead him to victory or will he be joining the kaiba brothers and his grandfather."
3,Pretty Good,"I thought this was a pretty good cookbook. Keep in mind it is not just one persons recipes, all the recipes are from diffrent people. This was the first vension cookbook I got. I have tried alot of recipes in it and and I enjoyed most of them. I have about 10 keepers from the whole book so far. This is where I got my Venison Parmesan receipe and it is the best, I make it for company and it always gets rave reviews. My only complaint, is that a few recipes are not complete and their are alot of repeats. I now own some other venison cookbooks, (see other reviews) but I still refer back to this. It may not be a must buy, but I found it worthwile and it was a good starting vension cookbook for me."
3,Just OK,This book is nothing special - a book of OK recipes that provide little insight into how to cook venison.
1,Nothing Special,"If you are looking for a cookbook that will keep you coming back for more, this is not it. While there are 301 entries, I do not consider it ""The Ultimate"". There are better."
2,Nothing like what iowa's Cousin Rick Black Has!! Give us The Deer Burger Cookbook anytime!,"Cut and Dry.. Iowa's Cousin Rick Black is by far the leader with us deer hunters and how we cook our harvest. I got a copy of 301 Venison Recipes from my uncle. I asked him why he was tossing it out? His reply? ""Heck boy, I got The Deer Burger Cookbook and the Venison Cookbook by Cousin Rick Black""!Yepper! Like everyone else. ""We will stick with Rick"" and his Deer Burger Cookbook and Bag Em and Tag Em."
4,It a cold one!,"Gary Paulsen has a dogsled race in Alaska. His dogs are interesting and smart too on this trip. Gary has lost a few friends and items and it is amazing. Let me give you a hint about the book, Gary's favorite dog is Storm."
4,It's OK.,"It's a very interesting book for people who like dogs,puppies,and the wilderness. It's OK and very dramatic because of the mysteries. I recommand you this book."
4,A moving story of great adventure and humor,"This truly is a wonderful story, but I'd like to interject a word of caution. The author has taken an certain amount of artistic license to enhance his 'nonfiction autobiography,' so you might want to research your facts before you start going around and impressing your friends with them. ;)"
4,really great...,"dear who are readiing my review, i loved this book as much as i loved any other book. but you see, i don't really understand the lessons Gary Paulsen learned in wood song can someone please help me and send them to my e-mail queersnog@hotmail.com?a bientot natalie,"
4,Very Good,"Woodsong is an autobiography of Gary Paulsen's life in Minnesota and in a dog-sled race in Alaska. Gary trained dogs to trap and to race. He had many adventures with his dogs. He starts off by trapping in Minnesota with his dogs. After an encounter with the death of a deer that got chased down by wolves, he decides trapping is cruel and he will not trap anymore. He enters a race in Alaska called the Iditarod. It is a long cold race across Alaska. He trains his dogs by running in Minnesota. In the race he encounters many obstacles; running in -20 degree weather, falling down a 30 foot frozen waterfall, bears eating his food and long runs through mountain passes. In the end of the book Gary finishes the race. Although not in first, he learns great lessons of life."
1,Disappointed,"I read this book in class and at home for school and I found it extremely BORING. I have read other Paulson books and enjoyed them, albeit this one was AWFUL. The thing I thought was totally wrong about this book is that it's supposed to be about the Iditarod, but 80 of the 120 pages were just experiences he had in the wilderness! It discusses how the author learned from a dog...I have a dog and love her but she doesn't speak to me!"
4,woodsong,"In Woodsong by Gary Paulsen, Manny wanted to win the race he was about to race all day he he thinking about the dogs.The nignt and race made this an exciting book. I would recomend it to kids of all ages."
3,Its alright,"Gary Palson is a very good writer!This is preatty good book but it does not have a lot of action in all of the chapters , that is why I did not think that it was a very good book. It had a lot of good things in it like , the mysteries ,blood squrts, and the Iditrod part was very good.If I had to read this book again I probly would not because it is good the first time but I would proubaly fall asleep if I read it again. It has a lot of good information about wilderness , dogs and mental life (hallucinations and little men who help him with dogs . I am a very good person and I have good taste in and books!"
2,Woodsong,This book was not placed in the right order. in the begining the first and second chapter are put in the right place but after that the race should come. Then the rest of chapters 3-8 should come at the end.I think the book was ok. I have read better books in my life. I think that anybody that doesn't like blood should skip through the first 2 chapters.If you read this book be prepaired to use your mind to put the book in the right order.
1,WORST BOOK EVER!!!!,I did not like this book at all! It was gross and sooo not worth taking the time to read! It was ridiculous. Our teacher read this to us and we did nt like it at all. We all groaned when he said to take it out and read it. I hated it! I do not like Gary Paulsens writing at all!
5,English Teacher Loves Gary Paulsen,"I have taught reading and writing to East Los Angeles - Hollenbeck Middle School - children of immigrants for the past three years. When I introduced ""Woodsong"" to my teens, I was worried that they would not be able to relate to a middle aged white guy in the snow. Not only do my ""Americans of Mexican descent"" love Paulsen but they love his dogs and other creatures he encounters: Scarhead, Hawk, Cookie, Columbia, Olaf, Obeah, the young dogs who discover fire, the doe that escapes into Paulsen's campsite, and especially Storm. The story of Storm and his stick brings tears to the eyes of even the most macho 14 year olds. Reading this book and others by Paulsen (Dirk the Protector and Older Run) have turned my kids onto reading other books by Paulsen, Jack London, Rudyard Kipling, and Louis L'Amour. I love you Gary!!!!!!!"
5,GREAT BOOK!!,This is a great book! I read it this summer. I really like Gary Paulsen in that he writes survival stories. I perticularly like his nature stories. I would recommend anyone to read this book!!
5,The book woodsong,In woodsong by gary paulsen there were many interasting points.The book woodsong is about a man and his name is manie.He loves dogs he started falling apart.He gave dogs dry food he would do things wrong.Then he found out that he had a spell on him.When it was time to race in the middle of it he herd his wife screem.He stoped the race and was happy his wife broke the spell.I would recomand it for ages 6-12 because woodsong is a good book that is good for kids to read.And it is good and kids will enjoy that book.
2,"Some parts I got, but I was asleep...","I read this book in 4th period Reading Class. However, most of the time we were reading this spesific book, I fell asleep. However, Gary Paulsen did a good job of living this book, I didn't really care for it.. I am very sorry but aventure books arent my type! :-("
4,Cartoons are Not just for Kids,"This collection of cartoons were shared by my son and grandson, so the good old cartoons are not just for children. Good for family viewing."
5,Excellant book,"This is an excellent novel. I am not normally an avid reader of mystery. However, I very much enjoyed the book, the pacing and the multiple story lines that helped to make this novel a compelling read. I had to force myself to read it slowly in order to enjoy it longer, and I found myself eagerly anticipating each chapter. David Fuller has done an excellent job with this novel, I hope to see more from him."
2,"Emotional arguments abound, use of bible as ""proof""","They want the lies out of the textbooks. Not lies about say Psychology or American history, but lies about Biology only. And then only evolution.Speaker condemns people that mock religion or creationism, yet his methodology is to present a few items in a list without connection, concluding there must be a designer, and then mock and deride scientists for not being able to see as ""obvious"" that we were designed.Waste of time. Imagine a nice folksy guy from say, Nebraska, telling you what he believes about the world, and condemning ""kids these days."""
5,I love this book!!,"I read it a while back and lost the book. I searched high and low and finally found it on Amazon. It's one of my favorites, as it's lighthearted and what they consider a cozy mystery. I like the characters and the setting."
2,Not a lot of trick-or-treating,"I read this book because I like Halloween; I have never read any other books in this series or by this author. However, there were more details about Lucy's breastfeeding than there were autumnal/Halloween-y elements, and the prospect of her kids trick-or-treating actually disturbed Lucy, so this was not exactly the book that I expected.The story and characters are very simple. If you're looking for a complex, tense murder mystery with nuanced characters and detailed descriptions, read a different book. If you want to read about a mother of four baking cupcakes, going to the gym, and caring for her elderly neighbor, you should find this book very satisfying.(As an aside, some of the characters make odd or even inappropriate comments - about bullying, dieting, people's appearances or mental health, etc. - and I personally felt that Lucy's reactions could have been better.)"
4,Received my book,"The product was definitely used, but that is what I purchased. Thanks for the quick service."
5,lost with out it,I have used B-V for 40 years now i can't find it I'm at a loss. it was made by Wilson years ago can anyone help Me find it.
3,"Great voice, bad production","I must say I think Katey Segal has one of the best vocal talents out there... but track after track, her arrangements and backgounds are monotonous and cheesy. Everything is synthesized and lends no heart to this sultry voice. Hope she releases another album with a better producer."
2,"Lover her, but:","I love Katey Sagal as an actress and as a person, and so I had to check out her music album. I was optimistic and biased toward liking anything she did. Actually I do like her singing voice. Unfortunately the songs are just not winners. If she got the right songs, arrangement and production, I believe she could make a great album. ""Well"" is ok. but not something I'm going to play very often. Not a single song that makes the great threshold. A few make it to pretty good. So if your a fan of MS. Sagal you may want to save your money here and risk it on a newer attempt of hers."
3,Asimov makes the mundane interesting.,"This is the second volume of Asimov's interesting life, a bit scary when seeing the thickness of the volume, but well worth it to really inderstand this man. His writing style is orderly and and paragraphs small, you keep reading just one more quick page until you find a chapter has passed.I did find it frustrating that he didn't include much insight into his family's personalites. He really valued their privacy, but it left me with a feeling of uncompleteness. It reads like diary entries that he knows someone will be reading. No gossip, just the facts.Isaac does give you a lot of insight into his personality, and by reading ""between the lines"" you see the real Asimov. He truly was a wonderful entertaining writer as he made the most commonplace activities, good reading."
3,Readable if you Admire Asimov,"This biography paints a positive picture of humanity and idealizes Asimov's life. Not much detail on his personal life or bad habits (he was famous for feeling up women) is included. If you like Asimov's work, reading this will let you follow the early professional development of the mind behind the words; Asimov at his peak reflecting upon himself. It's long, but keeps up a stream of entertaining anecdotes (easily forgotten).Still, after finishing the book, all I remember is Asimov knew celebrities, was great at parties, and made an interesting life for himself. He enjoyed being famous, and much of the book reinforces how famous he was. I believe his success came from sheer force of personality as much as ability. ""In Joy Still Felt"" is like an award Asimov wrote for himself, excellent self-marketing, emphasizing his own best face. I don't intend to re-read it."
4,Great tool for new gardener,"Just retired last year and now have time to work in the yard. Purchased this extension cord to use with an electric lawnmower because of the 70' length, the yellow color and Coleman's reputation for good products. The length allows me to reach all the corners of my yard plus turnaround room, and the yellow color has prevented me from running over the cord with the mower. It's also not so long that it's hard to handle. Also use it for the hedge trimmer. Had a little trouble with the safety feature in the plug, but have learned to manuever it into the mower's plug."
4,Definitely something different!,"Shonen Knife is definitely one of the most entertaining imports you'll ever come across. Hearing the singer mangle the word ""photosynthesized"" during Tomato Head is worth the price alone... OK, the fact that ""Tomato Head"" contains the word ""photosynthesized"" is worth the price alone. OK, the fact that the album contains a song called ""Tomato Head"" makes it worth the price alone! A fun, wacky album."
1,This Book Sucks,This Book was written by a Jew forcing her beliefs onto others. She must realize that her religion isn't the only one on earth.She is a crazy Jew.
2,Mixed feelings,"The mask was amazing. Everything else is disgusting yak, and mind you it's not easy to disgust me. Can't report any miracle transformations either. Quite the opposite. The last time I went for a facial, the beautician said these products really clogged my pores."
2,There are much better shows out there,"The first few episodes are pretty good, but the show gets really repetitive quickly. My husband and I were watching and we just got bored after a while. We just kinda looked at each other and were like, ""Meh, let's watch something else.""I still can't figure out if we're supposed to like Casey or not. And the sorority girls get really annoying. I guess there is a certain audience for this, which is not me. If you are a girl that's into clothes, money/status, makeup, and being boy crazy, this show is for you. If you're a guy that's into girls and parties, and don't really think about much else, this show is probably for you as well."
2,Greek Chapter 1,Well I though that this would be the whole first season and the price i paid for it should have been... this is the most rediculous thing i have ever heard of... splitting up the season like that... this is not a cartoon that needs volumes wtf
3,Interesting Peak Into College Life,"I didn't want to like this series but I found myself engrossed by the characters, especially Rusty. The series is an interesting peak into college life in general and Greek life especially -- both the good and the bad, but mostly the good. The reason why I couldn't give this DVD set more than three stars is because of the profanity (mild as it is), the promiscuity, and the binge drinking. Oh, and then there's the sorority president prostituting one of her sisters to keep one of the popular guys in the most popular fraternity attached to their sorority. Then that same sister dresses her sorority up like tramps to keep another fraternity from winning a floor hockey game. This is not something that belongs on a so-called family network. If you 16 or older you'll enjoy this series; if you're younger than that your parents should be blocking it."
1,Can these people spell?,One wonders about the intelligence of the producers when they can't even use the correct Greek letters in the name of their show. They have inadvertently named their show Grssk!
4,very nice surprise,"It's about time! a show about teenagers which isn't only about a boy and a girl being together and talking about how they feel for each other over and over (we have some but it's not only about them).So we follow the freshmen year of several characters when they arrive to college.Of course we have all the cliches of the genre (betrayal,love,friends,ect...)but in a light and not too soapy way.It's like American Pie became a TV show without the horny geeks (we still have some though,but they're not the main characters).Plus,there's a big change compared to the shows of my youth,the gay guy (who isn't a crazy queen or a depressed kid who feel cursed) is as important and developped as the rest of the characters of the show,and it's a nice and modern way to put it.And of course,the soundtrack is huge! Hope it will be released in France,where I'm from."
5,"This CD single is also part of the CD ""Fossils""","Great tunes on this CD single, maybe a good purchase for the big time Dinosaur Jr. collector. But, I would recommend purchasing the CD ""Fossils"" instead of this one. ""Fossils"" is a compilation of 3 early Dinosaur Jr. CD singles, and includes this one. It also contains the ""Freak Scene"" and ""Just Like Heaven"" CD singles."
5,A Major Gem,"Smart, tuneful, and utterly memorable, ""Martinis and Bikini's represents the high point in the woefully overlooked career of Sam Phillips.Produced by her husband T-Bone Burnette, ""Martinis and Bikinis"" pays a nod to mid 60's era Beatles to be sure, but it takes the fab four's influence and mixes it with unique touches all its own. Sam's lyrics suggest spiritual longing as it deals with relationships with both the mortal and the divine and it is all set to the kind of catchy, accessible melodies that have been absent from the mainstream music scene for the last decade."
5,"Beatlesque, yes - but Coltrane driven too?","I would like to add to the chorus of praise for this CD; it's one of my favorites. But although I appreaciate it's tight harmony and attention to songcraft, as many have aluded to with reviews that compare it to the Beatles, I find it has much in common with the modalism that John Coltrane perfected in his career. She can mine a hook deep and long, and songs such as Signposts or Same Rain become almost trancelike at times. I love this record"
4,"Ignore the ""Beatlesque"" Nonsense -- ...","... it's insulting. This owes more to Alex Chilton (_Boxtops_, _Big Star_) than John Lennon. There's nothing derivative about Sam Phillips; there's everything synthetic, in the sense of seeking and finding inspiration in many of the best aspects of American pop. The echoes of the Beatles here are really limited to a few sitar-like guitar sounds and one or two Preston-ish synth riffs. The bulk of it owes more to a strange and fruitful synthesis of southern/midwester pop (a la dBs, Dwight Twilley and Tom Petty) with '60s girl groups, as arranged by Debbie Harry or Lene Lovich.If you love hooks and great changeups, either _Martinis..._ or _Omnipop_ is a great bet. This is top-rank American pop. Accept no imitations and waste no time with comparisons."
5,found by mistake,"I found this cd randomly in some files i downloaded online, gave it a shot and was addicted. Since then I have bought anothe pair of her cds and have liked every one, but this is still my fave. If you ever feel like taking a chance, take a chance on this one. Its worth it."
2,Please come back Leslie!,"Leslie, where have you gone? It was about 20 years ago when I first heard you in ""Beyond Saturday Night."" Though it was only the first of your recordings, it was just so honest and clear and good.Martinis and Bikinis still is honest, but it requires a heck of a lot of thinking to digest, and sometimes it just hurts to listen to it. I'm not looking for cotton candy ""Dancing with Danger"" but Sam, please, come back!!!"
2,Disappointing,"After the other good reviews, I was really disappointed. There are some good songs. But there are some really obnoxious songs too. Figure on half a CD's worth of good music."
5,Fit's like a glove as promised & holding up well.....,"It took me a second to figure out the best way to pull it on over the MP3 player; but after that I was very happy. It fits and has worn well in spite of horrible conditions; being tossed about in my car, backpack and pockets..... it's a ""Keeper"". (Just like the product it covers !)"
2,"oh well, at least it's cheap","this chain ring is very poor quality, it is way out of round...but at least it is pretty inexpensive."
3,The Jacksons,"This is only a selection from the book. It is not the entire book. This was not clear to me before ordering. The binding is very tight although the pages are old and yellowed. It is very hard to hold it open to read it. However, I will keep it for my library. All in all, it is in good condition. It offers insight into the Jackson family which is why it was purchased and that's why I will keep it."
5,COWBOYS OF FAITH,WAS LOOKING FOR A DVD FOR FATHERS DAY 2010. PLANNING A FATHER'S DAY BIG SCREEN DAY WITH SEVERAL DVD'S PLAYING. THIS DVD WILL WORK OUT VERY WELL FOR THIS SPECIAL DAY. HAS FAITH VALUES AND THE SPORT OF RODEO THAT THE MEN OF OUR CHURCH WILL LOVE. GREAT DVD.
4,Graduation gift,It is going to work for what I purchased it for.I purchased it for my son's college graduation.And to have every teacher and professor that hehas done or created a dance piece for write a memory in it.
5,One of the best books on the nature of I,"Excellent book! It shows in astonishing profundity how Descartes's ""I think therefore I am"" was just the beginning of a beginning of the serious discussion on the first-person authority.Mr. Moran successfully demonstrates that the otherwise disprivileging similarities between the first-person perspective and the third-person one, in fact, offer us the best possible understanding of the first-person as an agent responsible for her own actions in a world dominated by Other-person-stances. The arguments he brings in defense of his position range from subtle to sublime. I especially enjoyed his extended analysis of Sartre's rakehell-gambler. Highly recommended."
3,"Yep, they sure are","This DVD has got 20 great-looking women modeling nude or at least topless, and yes, they all have Heavenly Hooters. Not monstrously huge ones, just very nice. There are some famous models and actresses here, such as Julia Parton (aka Nina Alexander), Julie Strain (yes, just topless here for some odd reason), Lauren Hays, Lori Jo Hendrix, Heidi Lynn Staley, and others, but don't worry, famous or not, they're all gorgeous. And they're in various settings - some bathing or showering, some lying on the beach, some dancing around on their patio, and so on. The camerawork is good, and moves along quickly enough so as not to get tedious. So it's all professional-looking and the ladies model well, but most of them are not incredibly erotic about it. It appears they were told not to be too explicit. Thus, this is not one of the most thrilling of this type of DVD I've ever seen. But heck, with beautiful women in various stages of undress on my TV screen, what's not to like?"
3,Post-cream CD,"This CD has some very good miusic and a couple of stinkers on it. Recommended, but be aware and sample first."
1,not just yet,Well ... i`d be only too delighted to review this much awaited (literally)!Gary Moore collaboration... alas !!! ...it has STILL NOT ARRIVED !!!!
5,Surprisingly inspiring...,"This is an absolutely amazing story of faith, endurance and perseverance. The tale is understated with narrative first-person flashbacks of the Andes crash survivors. An original and lean piano music score perfectly complements the grim yet inspiring tale of how these men survived.At the end, I watched through tears as I saw their expediency in the mountain as a type of sacrificial eucharist.I dare you to watch it with a dry eye!"
5,The best in Documentay,This is documentary at its best. I watched the movie Alive many times.... it is awesome... and inspiring.... Nando and Roberto are what the very best of humankind are made of.... all these people are an inspiration to me and I'm sure to others.... May they live gloriously happy lives for ever....
2,It's a little boring. Just guys talking.,"While the story is interesting, the documentary itself mainly is just guys talking. There aren't many visually interesting scenes at all. I guess I was expecting to be whisked off into the Andes to see the plane crash, but I was left just watching guys reminisce about past experiences.There just wasn't much recorded material of the plane crash except for a few blurry photographs. I think this would have made for an interesting book, but as a documentary there just isn't enough... and the pace is quite slow (the film is 2 hours long)."
1,That's What Makes Horse Races,"I guess it just goes to show you how widely tastes differ! I found this book to be poorly structured and plotted, with paper-thin characterization, too much reliance on coincidence, poor worldbuilding, and intrusive Britishisms that detracted from the realism of the supposedly-American dialogue. There are better novels, in terms of entertainment value, that begin from similar theses (including its central motif, that Ronald Reagan was {""is"", at the time of writing} the only person who truly understood the Red Menace)."
4,Good foundation,I am new to Max and I found it very helpful. You get a lot of information in the 90 min tape. I have watched it several times and I always pick up something new.
2,Pumping Them Out,"I sometimes wonder if M.C. Beaton has a ghostwriter. Some of her Hamish and Agatha books are just fantastic, while others are really rushed and crap. I wish she would either get back to writing her own books or slow down. I'm very disappointed, because when the books are good, they're great--funny, smart, great insights into human behavior. Money's great, but not at the expense of really good writing."
3,Please Add A Little Cleverness to the Plots,"Resolving the plot with the criminal showing up with a gun, getting attacked, losing the gun, and then spilling the beans, is getting a bit tiresome. The intricacies of Agatha Christie at her best meshing with Beaton's charming characters and her engaging writing would create mystery masterpieces. However, plotting is not Beaton's strength. I'm still hooked, but I must say I expect to be disappointed time and time again in the manner she sorts out her murder-tinged ditties. This author is no doubt a comic novelist who somehow shoehorned herself into mysteries. She could have been a Wodehouse, which would seem a much better fit."
4,"The Scots, Death, Humor and Who Dun-it?","For pure delightful entertainment I read M.C. Beaton and especially like her Hamish Macbeth mystery series. How Beaton moves from the Highlanders to the Glaswegians is just pure good fun! And there's plenty of dead bodies along with suspects and lots of twists n' turns along with Hamish's love interests. The women love him too! Good looking big red-headed from the made-up wee town of Lochdubh. One can have a good laugh at how the Scots think about anything from dead bodies, to how to solve a mystery, food and each other in this town where gossip rules supreme! Many come to holiday and often, don't leave alive. I'll keep reading Ms. Beaton's books because they are fine wee mysteries without all that blood and gore so many authors need to write about. With these, I can drift off to sleep knowing the killer will be found and not dream of the entrails of the poor victims. Enjoy!"
1,Phoned it in,"I usually enjoy M.C. Beaton's books on Hamish. But not this time. It seemed that the author simply slapped words down to get the plot on the page with perfunctory words. No excitement. Even the characters sounded bored with their words. Same old story line -- women for some reason find this man enchanting, but I especially couldn't stir up any interest in him, nor the other characters. M.C. Beaton must have had a deadline to complete a book this year and this was the effort. I'm assuming it's a 'one-book-per-year' arrangement so I will anticipate that the next books will be equally boring. I'll have to find another author to keep me challenged. Read if you have nothing else on hand, but even the dictionary would be more exciting."
3,Not one of the best,"Two artists come to live in Lochdubh, first Effie Garrard arrives, then genial Jock Fleming. Effie develops an embarrassing crush on Jock, who does not return her feelings. then Effie is found dead, apparently by suicide, but Hamish suspects foul play. As well as solving the murder, Hamish has to cope with his complex love life, various women from his past pop up again, and there are a few new ones as well.I found the story mildly entertaining, but a bit tired. The one about the attractive man who creates havoc among the women has been done before, and better (Death of a Charming Man), and I found all the desperate lovesick women getting on my nerves a bit.Worth reading if you are a Macbeth fan, but definitely not one of the strongest stories in the series."
2,ok for HBO but not a whole movie,this film is generic&pretty much shows Ali G as One demensinal overall.the show on Hbo is hit&Miss with me on a whole. this film just basically is just kinda there.not much happening with it. in other words what works for Tv doesn't work for the Big screen&this is the case here.
3,Very funny,"Got it for my husband, was very hard to find in stores and amazon was the cheapest online."
3,ok... get cohen's other stuff first,"this is like sacha baron cohen meets airplane the movie. not bad, but get the originals first."
4,Not nearly as good as Borat,But that could be because I'm not British & don't understand some of the references & also it could be because it was produced before Borat & his acting is better then. I'm still happy I bought it though.
2,2 1/2 stars!,"After watching Borat, and loving it. I decided to watch Ali G Indahouse. From the hilarity of Borat, I expected Sacha Baron Cohen's Ali G Indahouse to be just as funny, and entertaining, I was wrong. While Ali G provides some hilarious moments, there are too many slow spots in the movie. There were times I laughed by butt off, them other times the movie was so boring. If you loved ""Borat"" rent ""Ali G Indahouse"" it is not anywhere near as good as ""Borat."" 2 1/2 stars, worth a rental!"
3,Indahouse,"Pretty funny. Not the same as Ali G in his ""natural"" glory, but hilarious nonetheless. Includes a Borat cameo."
5,is it cos i's black,"big up urself ali. whagwan dis movie be da best ting i's seen all year, next to borat. only complaint: not enough massive babylons"
1,yuck,it was pornographic. didn't expect it. thought it would be more witty but it was crass and vulgar. a disappointment.
3,No Borat,"This movie had a few laughs, but a pretty uneven effort compared to the Borat Movie. Your mileage may vary."
5,One of the best movies i've seen,"This movie is not only incredibly funny, but it is also well written with likable characters. Absolutely a must see unless you are easily offended."
1,You are warned! Very bad!,"As a big fan of the Ali G series and the movie Borat I bought this DVD.Horrible, Horrible Horrible.Think of any cheesy 80's movie and this compares. Overall this movie is as bad as the pathetic Saturday Night Live movies. Remember the bad ones? Stuart Saves His Family (Al Franken), It's Pat (Julia Sweeney), The Coneheads, A Night At the Roxbury, Superstar (Molly Shannon). The Ladies Man (Tim Meadows) was a great cable viewing experience compared to this.Borat worked because it was a collection of skits loosely tied together, Ali G was a pathetic attempt at cinema."
2,Not Half the Sparkle of the Series,"I've been a huge fan of Da Ali G Show, and knew a feature film couldn't come close to the outrageous originality of da show. Still, ""Ali G Indahouse"" isn't half bad and if you're a fan at all, it's certainly worth a viewing, just to see some familiar names fleshed out. There are some genuinely funny moments - but it's obvious that the (at least seemingly) spontaneous quality of the series can't really be replicated for ""da film.""Sasha Baron Cohen is brilliant with this (and his other characters), but I hope in the future if Ali wants to get in ""da movies"" he sits back, watches a few episodes of the show and decides to keep doing what he does best."
1,IT SUCKED!!!!!!!,"Ali G: meet Stuart Smalley, The Ladies Man, Pat, and the Butabi brothers. You are now in the distinguished company of your SNL cousins from across the pond who turned funny 5 minute skits into full length movie suckfests. Yes, Da Ali G show is hilarious, due mostly to its main character, Ali G. His interviews with famous politicians and roundtable discussions with experts are never a disappointment. You would therefore think that an Ali G who is funny in extemporaneous situations such as an interview would be even funnier in a movie which he scripted. And you would be incorrect, sir! The movie is a 90 minute mess. The ""plot"" is mentioned elsewhere on this page, so no need for me to ridicule it. But suffice it to say that the Ali G character here is a grating bore, lacking in wit or charisma. If you like Ali G, you will not like this."
2,Very Disappointing.,"Well, I'm very surprised to see that this movie received as many 5 stars ratings as it did, perhaps my negative reaction to it was misguided. I have to say, and make no mistake about it, Sacha Baron Cohen is top dog when it comes to comedy so that people would buy the DVD is a given. I'm about to get Season 2 of the Ali G show in the mail and I'm sure I'll love it as much as I did Season 1. The only words that I can use to describe the movie Borat are ""total joy."" There's not many movies better, but the same can't be said about Indahouse. As a vehicle for his talent, this flick was a Yugo. I found it incredibly boring and I was extremely disappointed. In fact I turned it off after 50 minutes. There are no interviews (which is what made his show so great) and there is no Borat or Bruno to add to the hilarity. I'd say to take a pass on this one. Actually, if Cohen wasn't in it I'd give it only 1 star."
1,not funny at all,Im a big fan of the HBO series and this movie is nothing like it.I didnt laugh once.If your expecting this movie to be the least bit funny you will be wrong.I dont know why or how someone so funny could make a movie so bad.Stick to the series.
2,Missing its fundamental ingredient,"The Bottom Line:The reason Sasha Baron Cohen is funny is because of the fact that he's springing his outrageous personas on real people, so I have no idea why the creators of Ali G Indahouse thought they should change the nature of Cohen's comedy by putting his Ali G character through a series of very scripted and largely unfunny motions that take him away from his strong suit; the problem would be rectified in Borat and Bruno, but this film (which tellingly wasn't given a theatrical release in the U.S.) falls flat on its face.2/4"
1,I love the show,"Huge fan of the show, so I thought I'd rent his movie. I was severly disappointed. Some reviews here state that if you enjoy Ali G on tv, you must enjoy the movie. Not true at all. The intelligent and witty humor in the show is a complete opposite of the crass and base ""humor"" of the movie. I had to stop watching it after twenty minutes, and the only reason I put the movie back in was to see Borat's cameo. So I sat through the movie, and Borat said two words. I finished the movie, hoping for some glimmer of worth. No dice."
1,Avoid at all costs!,Simply if you have the slightest respect for your self avoid this film. I believe it is a shame for humanity.
2,AMERICA'S CRITIC,"INDAHOUSE YA THE OUTHOUSE MOVIE SUCKED BEST THING IN THIS WAS THE GIRLS AND CARS,,, ACTING WAS TERRIBLE PLOT WAS THERE ONE THIS WAS JUST GARBAGE!!!!!"
3,AN UNEXPECTED SURPRISING ENCOUNTER,"I don't agree with previous reviews saying that this is an ""inferior"" album. I've discovered the powerful voice of Julia through it and I've found it wonderful, passing from the soul of ""I can't help myself"" to the feelful ballad ""Threadbard"". I've been quite surprised myself by this album I bought in a casuality: I ACTUALLY came across it in a cd store and a uncertain good feeling invaded me & I knew I should buy it. It's really a album full of soul that has impulsed me o buy another titles from Julia to discover her."
3,Not as good as her Porcelain album,"I've enjoyed Julia's albums, but this one is not up to the level as Porcelain album. If you've never heard Julia Fordham before, then I'd recommend you start with her older albums first. Don't judge her by this album, please."
5,Very nice fan for larger bathroom,If you have a larger bathroom and like the Aged Bronze look this is a very good fan. There are not very many fans to choose from with this CFM rating (110) that are also decorative. It is fairly large and may not look proportioned in a smaller bathroom.
3,Sounded good at the time,"I thought it would be good to have a night light in the bathroom however, according to my electrician, this would have required a third line run, which we didn't in a remodel but might be ok in new construction.The required light are tiny. They give you very little space so you can't use the bulbs you already have."
1,poor design,I have hunter ceiling fans in my house and I love them. But I am not happy with the design of this product. I cant unscrew the base after 2 years because the screw has rusted shut. Why would use rustable metal in a product designed for a humid bathroom?? Make no sense
5,Hunter 83003,I have not installed it but I hooked it up to the power was very happy with the power and how quiet it is. We are hoping to finish up the kitchen and about the first of the year start on the main bedroom.
5,Absolutely gorgeous!,"My husband and I live in an older Victorian home, and finding things that ""fit"" is often times difficult. Bathroom fans are no exception to this! We decided that this Aventine model from Hunter was the closest we would get, and boy does it look sharp! With 2, 60 watt bulbs, it does a great job of lighting up the entire bathroom!Installation went relatively as well as expected, but given the age of the house, installing anything has its share of challenges!I am extremely happy the fan, light, and night light! People that we show are absolutely surprised to find out that it's a fan, as it is extremely well concealed!"
3,Only the first two stories were real good,"""THe SPiderworman"" and ""Crevices"" were outstanding; ""Crevices"" was even genuinely creepy.The other three, ""The Sacrifice,"" ""Blonde Swaidan"" ""Presentiment"" were just the opposite: I though aweful, even bored me.Well, two out of five isn't bad, so I gave it three stars."
2,Japanese Goosebumps!,"This film is $7.50 at walmart! The Japanese Goosebumps! Twilight Zone wannabes! Yeah, it's good. Good to laugh at! The Sacrafice should have been packaged alone for $1.50; I would have been satisfied!"
2,"Prefer the ""Old School"" to this line.","These are nowhere near as good as the ""Old School"" editions. These *might* be better than nothing, but I'm disappointed in the difference between them.What they really need to do is expand on the Old School vols 1-3."
5,Another Amazing Album,"Yes, Curve has done it again. Their first two releases ""Pubic Fruit"" and ""Doppelganger"" were two of the best albums released in the early 90's. Their trademark thrash guitars with techno beats, and Halliday's sensual goth like voice, are what Curve is about. ""Cuckoo"" shows a maturity in the band. Songs like ""Crystal"" and ""Superblaster"" are pure Curve. ""Missing Link"" is an all out rock fest, which is a great opener. But songs like ""Unreadable Communication"" and ""Left Of Mother"" are somewhat new sounding, and show us a new side to Curve that makes them much more dimensional. Another wonderful album from a great band that no one knows much of."
4,Super Blast!,While globally less strong than the first album it contains the unbelievable song Superblaster...You have to hear it to believe it.
5,Great disc,Great use of electronics here. I first fell in love with the title track and then bought the album. Soulful singing and great music add up to a winning combination for Toni and Dean.
2,Not really fresh.,"I was disappointed by the quality of these spices. They didn't seem very fresh & I ended up supplementing some ingredients as it didn't have enough red peppers or some other spices. It did arrive quickly, which was good, & I was able to use some when I fixed it up a bit. The price was good compared to what else was available locally, but I would not purchase again."
1,Not what was expected,"Product (very weak in flavor) arrived in time as promised. Unfortunately, you get what you pay for (discounted price), as this is not the same as McCormicks. No Savings as you must double the usage."
3,Didn't deliver,"The CD started well, a good attempt at mixing a MC with DJs onto a Drum & Bass CD. Why this doesn't occur more often within the Tekstep sub genre is beyong me (LTJ Buken and MC Conrad do it all the time within their sub genre).Overall the tracks didn't stand out and the CD is just the same as any of the more recent (and superior) releases from the likes of Dieselboy, Bad Company, J Majik, Metalheadz, Total Science etc."
3,quality drum and bass,"when Ed Rush and Optical released WORMHOLES in 1998 they were acclaimed as the best in the business, mixing dancefloor drum n'bass tracks from a tech step approach, yet with more soul and rhythm than many of their contemporaries. However, this 2000 release, THE CREEPS, did not have the same revolutionary sound, though good in it's own right. The sound was less adventurous and diverse. Many of the tracks sound too similar to each other, which is a week point for the album. Aside from that, this duo consist of two of dnb's most qualified producers. The follow up to this in 2003, THE ORIGINAL DOCTOR SHADE, is a return to form. The duo reminded us that they could make tracks that were intelligent in sound yet jumping, and that their tunes did not all sound the same."
3,Didn't deliver on the whole,"The CD started well, a good attempt at mixing a MC with DJs onto a Drum & Bass CD. Why this doesn't occur more often within the Tekstep sub genre is beyong me (LTJ Buken and MC Conrad do it all the time within their sub genre).Overall the tracks didn't stand out and the CD is just the same as any of the more recent releases from the likes for Bad Company, J Majik, Metalheadz, Total Science etc."
2,THIS JUNGLE HAS BEEN CHOPPED DOWN,"This was an hyped up album, and i was expecting a hardcore jungle album but this is about as soft as it gets. It borders on club/ dance music. I also experienced similar problems with Dillinja and both Bad Company release's although they were much better than this commercial tripe.If you want a decent jungle album, Ram Trilogy's molten beats goes someway to providing a decent album. Blackmarket's compilation and some 1.8.7 tunes are also good but avoid this if you want a hardcore jungle album. Buy if you want a soft-core uninspiring d&b album."
4,great stuff,"This a really nice EP. ""Bloodsports"", the live track, shows that Rinérse can give away an amazing live performance. ""Le Professeur Suicide"" is also great - and it has vocals in it, which is quite something for this French band. And then there is the good ""The Rock Summer"" track - great thumping dance music, with nice guitars.I won't give it five stars because two tracks are already on the forthcoming album. So this means only one exclusive track."
5,A truly wonderful book,"I can't say enough good things about this book. So often I feel alone and like the only Christian that struggles with some of the issues Jan deals with in her book. This book will not only get you on your way down the road to healing and wholeness, it will give you something else. HOPE. I was so encouraged by this book and it also showed me that I am not alone in my struggles. Even if I do feel that way. It has been a major struggle for me to believe deep down, that Jesus loves me unconditionally.I also like that this book is geared towards women of all ages and walks of like. Not just for particular age group, just singles or just marrieds. I believe EVERY woman who reads this book will benefit. Jesus can and will heal our ""aching places"" IF we let Him.I highly recommend this book."
4,Great Mac & Cheese!,"Annie's has a great line of food, and this macaroni and cheese is great. Kids like it; grown-ups like it!!"
3,"All natural, but bland","It's all natural, no artificial color, no weird ingredients . . . but it also has no taste. The sauce is thin and runny and doesn't have much flavor. If you need a boxed dinner in a pinch, then by all means use a product with natural ingredients. But if you want good mac and cheese, stick with homemade."
2,Organic is great but...,"I love Annie's, but this had no taste, very bland and unappealing. I would not purchase this again, but worst of all I'm stuck with 6 boxes...boo!"
1,So so,This is twice as expensive as basic box Mac and Cheese. It is just so so in taste. If you check the ingredients it is not much different than other Mac and Cheese. The cost does not justify the ordering. I will not be ordering from Amazon again. The cost is much cheaper at a big box chain.
4,yummy mac and cheese,"this mac and cheese is good and i like it. (we get the smaller box, but it's still the same taste) we dont add milk at mac and cheese and it still tastes good. walmart has it and food lion might. it's good."
3,This music needs Viagra!,"I bought this album for $3.00 here on Amazon, based on reviews I read here. It arrived today. I gave it 3 spins and came to the conclusion that this album/music is, although recorded well, was not what I was hoping to hear.It really sucks to think that just because five guys (musicians) like a certain style of music, that they can re-create that music, send out demos to companies like Metal Blade (who sign all sorts of unoriginal acts), and offer albums full of this regurgitated crap to the public. The galloping beats remind me of early Savatage, the guitars were nothing special - typical harmonized (bastardized) riffs that seem to ""Iron Maiden"" their way around the whole album. The guy sounds like a T.Lindberg clone. I say, if youre going to rip off another bands material... do it well. If I was 12 years old, this album probably wouldve blew my mind.If you want to an hear original Death/Thrash band then do yourself a favor & check out Dimension Zero. They f-ing rip!!"
1,Don't Buy It.. Buy The New Nevermore,"There are too many bands that sound like The Absence(Black Dahlia, Dozen Furies, Unearth, etc.). Too many bands ripping off the Gothenburg sound.Two guitar harmonies. Big deal.Opeth got sick of it after Morningrise and so should you."
5,Paul Metal King doesn't know anything,"Please disregard his review. This cd is amazing. Sounds a bit like old Melodic Death metal you haven't heard since high school. If At the Gates and In Flames had a baby The Absence would be it. From your Grave is a powerful metal cd which captivates your soul with great guitars and superb songwriting.These guys are destined to get really big in a few years.Unearth, Dozen Furies and everyone else doesn't do guitar harmonies as good as these guys . If you like these guys then check out ""Against the Elements"" from Beyond the Embrace because they sound similar."
5,"BETTER THAN ""RIDERS..."" IN MY OPINION","This CD is amazing. If anyone says different, they do not like Gothenburg style metal, nor did they listen to At The Gates. Because, this is very At The Gates to me, and it rules!People seem to like the more accessable ""Riders of the Plague"" more than this release. I like ""Riders..."" just fine. It's more for musicians than people who want to get a dose of lethal metal. I like ""From You Grave"" better because of the raw feel it has.People should buy this CD. It's pretty defining in the Melodic Death Metal genre. It is simply a masterpeice of metal."
3,King size comfort,"I don't particularly care about what my sheets look like just as long as they feel good. For the price, these are great! The best thing, they fit my king sized tempurpedic. It is so hard to find a sheet that fits that bed! thanks!"
4,Great for Family Home Evening,"I use this for idea starters for family home evening. You can easily to months, building on top of the lesson before. Easy to read, easy to put together. Some of the stories seem a little less pulled together than other VeggieTale stories, but I love it nonetheless."
4,Great devotional for little ones!,"I love this devotional. My kids are little and the devotionals are short enough to keep their attention. Plus, they love that it has the characters from their favorite Veggietales films. This is just what I was looking for."
3,A little frustrating,"Better graphics - more dimensional. Seems to fire slower than Anun Rising and I'm stuck on level 9-3 which is a little frustrating. Don't like the delay when the level first opens (can't shoot anything for about 3 seconds)and sometimes it gives you colors that you don't need and no where to launch them -- which means a greater chance of losing. If I can't get past level 9-3 soon, I'll probably uninstall."
3,Luxor Two is fun,Luxor 2 is fun to play. Luxor 3 is actually more entertaining and less frustrating. Luxor 2 is more difficult than Luxor 3. The main problem is that it is hard on my eyes and I can only play for short periods.
1,All dressed up and no place to go,Luxor 2 requires updates to your computer not required by Luxor One and Luxor three. Be sure your computer has the right updates before you load the program. It is almost impossible to re-load even with the updates.
1,frustrating,I wish I hadn't have spent the money on it. I can't get past level 10-4 on the normal level to the point of going mad ! I think there are too many levels. Too many opening doors to get to each one.. The marbles are so illuminating that it is hard to see what all is going on while you are blasting them. I find it hard to catch the extra life medallion things with so much illuminating colors. I always mix up the red and orange they are so close in color. The only thing I like is the sphere that changes the color. If they put that on Luxor 1 it would suit me fine. I think they added TOO much to the graphics. They could of just added the new spheres to the Luxor 1 would of been good. I quit playing it and yet now the old game seems boring.
2,Luxor 2,"its not the best, i prefer Luxor 1 over Luxor 2. The imagining on Luxor 2 is shakey and bumpy. Hard to manuever shots."
3,"Terribly biased, but the best we have","Ullica Segerstrale was perhaps the only outsider to carefully follow the landmark debate over sociobiology first-hand, sitting in on meetings and interviewing the participants. Thank goodness she was willing to write it all down. Too bad she was such a blatant partisan.Most books have endorsements on the back cover from other authors. This one only features an endorsement from Segerstrale herself. And the featured reviews on Amazon are hardly from disinterested parties -- Sarah Blaffer Hrdy is a well-known sociobiologist herself, who receives extensive favorable treatment in this book.The book was well-written and interesting, but the reader must work to subtract Segerstrale's overwhelming bias from every quote and conclusion. Such questions of scientific fact do have right and wrong answers. It's too bad Segerstrale consistently gets them wrong and then feels she has to distort the positions of her opponents to mask this fact."
3,Where's Juan?,"Yes the ideas are good, but where's Juans singing? That guy can wail! So far I haven't heard the intense drive that I heard in Id, Ego, and Superego. Music is good, just sounds incomplete."
3,I love being in H.A.R.M.'S way,"This movie is like Charlie's Angels if the budget was cut in 1/2 then 1/2 again, then 1/2 again. Take that budget and cut it in 1/2 again and again and again. You get the picture, this is one cheap production! But that doesn't make it bad. It's actually quite fun! I really enjoyed the action and the girls are really cute. My favorite is Viola. If you like B-Movie fare and like to have fun with something different. I think you would like this film. The acting is great and there's a lot of love put into the overall production. It's the story of these spy-girls and they're out to stop a mad man. Not much new on plot, but the fun twists more than make up for it. Again, if you like B-Movies I would recomend it. If you don't know what I'm talking about, STAY WAY!"
5,Beautiful picture quality!,"I was searching for a good quality digital frame, one for my parents and one for my desk at work. I bought two no-name brands at Linens and Things and returned them both. They were horrible, very difficult to operate and crummy picture quality. I waivered on buying the Philips because of the price and the fact that it doesn't have sound. Well, I'm so glad I got the Philips. The picture quality is fantastic and I had no problem setting it up. It would be nice if it had sound and video, but it's just perfect for my office. You won't be disappointed with the Philips, it's worth the $$."
4,From the pen of the legend.,"Legendary coach Joe Newton inspires runners not only at York Community High School in Elmhurst IL, but many more across the state and nation. This is less of a technical book -- for that go to Daniels' Running Formula -- and more of an insight to a coach and a program. Definitely worth a read!"
3,The book and the author,"I have been to running camp for the past three years where Jow Newton has spoken. He is a great motivator, but I have been told that some of the stories he speaks about are not necessarily true, especially the one about the girl with no arms and no legs swimming across a pool. The book has some great motivational stuff in there and it is a good tool to use for coaching or individual running."
3,Interesting Read,"I read this book because of the documentary ""the long green line"". I am a runner not a coach but I still thought this book was worth the read."
3,Overworked in Illinois,"While this is a revolutionary book for it's type (there are not many guides to coaching cross country) I think that there is an underlying flaw with coach Newton's philosophy. From what I read of Newton's workout chart, it seems that he over works his runners. While this does get quality results and fast runners, it is not working in the runners best interest. High schoolers who are worked too much get burnt out easily and are overlooked by college cross country coaches."
5,It's written by Joe Newton.. enough said,Joe Newton is without a doubt the greatest cross country coach in America and quite possibly the world. I personally have the honor of running for him and I can tell there is nobody better. The motivational speeches he gives you are truly inspiring and are what bring the York cross country team together. Buy this book to learn about cross country and to learn about life.
3,OK,It was an ok manual type of reference book. It really needs to be updated to current training methods.
2,A york Tale,"Hey everybody, I agree with the others about this book talking to much about York and how many times they have won state titles. The hard miles the runner's put out during the XC season may not benefit them in a long term career. There are some decent speed work ideas to use in this book but I feel the training could be updated with more modern techniques that could possibly give the athletes more longevity. I also have a problem with the Standout runners being held back to run for points."
2,not what i expected at all,"I heard Cure me or Kill Me and Tiujuana Jail on the radio and thought this would be a hard album. Not so - After these two songs which are really good, it turns into practically a country album. I was really caught off guard here. Other GNR members make some nice appearances though."
5,This is Gilby Clarke's BEST!!,"Truly awesome CD! Just got it today, and quickly added Tijuana Jail and his cover of The Stones' ""Dead Flowers"" to my top songs of all time!! Gilby's Tijuana jail rocks with riffs by Slash, and Dead Flowers stars W. Axl Rose, the first ever CD I have heard w/ Rose, that wasn't GNR...(although anxiously awaiting Bach's new CD in Nov). Duff, Slash, and Matt Sorum star in other songs, but Gilby is an awesome guitarist and has great lyrics. Of all of the GNR members, it is hard to decide whose solo tunes I like best, but I can say Gilby is hard to beat!!"
3,its okay,"I bought it for my son so we could all go on rides together. He is 9 months old and he fits in it fine. i wouldn't suggest putting anybody younger in it though because it has your kid sit pretty upright and younger kids tend to slump. it rides good and it connected to our schwinn bike pretty easy. i couldn't even tell it was back there until i went uphill.the reason its 3 stars is because the top part buttons up instead of zips which makes it harder to get to your kid quickly, the seatbelt buckles are a pain to get off, and the seatbelts really rub your kids neck raw. also when he gets older i can tell that if he sticks his feet in a certain spot the bottom will rub on the ground."
5,My dog loves it!,It is impressively easy to set up...seriously it takes less than 30 seconds. I tow it behind my mtorized bike to get my dog around and she loves it.
1,Falling Apart,"We bought this trailer for Christmas, planning on using it for the ocassional bike ride. We've probably used the trailer 15 to 2o times in the last 10 months. The other day I put my son in, attached the seat belts, started riding, and heard a loud pop. The nylon strap that holds the seat up off the fabric floor had snapped. Before I could even get a good look at it, the nylon seat belt in between my son's legs also snapped. I've looked it over pretty well and don't think there's a way I can repair it. We're so disappointed. I would not recommend this product."
1,Very cheap materials,"Though we were initially thrilled, we were not so happy when the first of the restraint straps broke within a few weeks of purchase. A few weeks later a second strap broke, rendering one side of the trailer unusable. Six months later, straps on the other side began fraying and snapping. Mind you, this was with infrequent use and with two children under the age of three--not really heavy or active kids. The trailer was kept outside in mild weather, covered and in the shade. Now (at just over a year of ownership) all of the straps have completely rotted apart and it is completely unsafe to put our kids in it. After reading through several of the other reviews, this is clearly a recurring issue.Though we ultimately purchased the Instep Take 2 for less than $100 (on sale), I wouldn't buy this trailer again for half the price. I'm all for saving a buck where you can, but this is a *complete* waste of cash."
1,it sucks,"Sure it's easy to assemble and attach, but the company probably spent all their energy figuring out a ""quick and easy"" assembly and abandoned any thought on a child's comfort. I bought this for my 15 month old son to ride with my 18 month old neice. she was okay for 2 minutes and then she just wanted out of it. My son wriggled in it and the straps got tangled. We can usually overlook small things, but it was impossible to try and make the seat work well. it's just cheap material hanging from a bar with uncomfortable and difficult straps with no padding. Definitely not a ""quick 'n easy"" harness system. There's no structure to the seat and it also lacked padding for back support. If you really want a trailer and a GOOD one, you should look at the more expensive ones (I saw several good ones at REI).I finally decided I'd rather get the iBert child seat for my bike, since I've done my research on it and it has received 88 five star reviews, an award, and recognition on parenting magazine ^_^ ."
1,Still have not received this item...,"I ordered this item April 3, 2008 and have still not received nor been charged for this item. Tried calling customer service, left two voicemails and no one has called me back letting me know the status of this item.Note: Received item June 11, 2008. Actual product it alright at best. Cloth is very cheap looking and fraying at the edges already from use and the left wheel is warped to the left so it doesn't ride smoothly. Called company to receive exchange or refund pending damage in mail and no call as of July 1, 2008...big surprise..."
2,Too small,"This bike trailer is way too narrow to comfortably carry two larger children (35-50 pounds). It would be good for my 33 pound son alone, but I don't think the trailer would be usable if we had another child. I had to take it apart and return it after discovering this."
1,Straps/Seatbelts fall apart - literally,"I don't think that I have to say too much as this review is just a repeat of what others have said. This trailer seemed wonderful at first, but it fell apart in a short amount of time. Well, everything is in great shape EXCEPT the straps that are needed to keep my child safe. I had parked it for the summer and went to get it as the weather is nicer. Pulled it out and all of the straps disentegrated...they are powder. That is absolutely ridiculous!"
1,Dreadful,I bought this trailer two years ago. that frame is very good and is very light weight. but the canvas has simply shredded. I have a different brand of bike trailer that is 4 years older and has no damage to the canvas I have treated them both the same but the insteps canvas has become a danger as it is falling apart.
3,"ok for a cheapie, but poor quality materials and no floorboard!","Considering we paid $88 for this, it's alright. EASY to put together. Cheap materials. I don't like the strap layout. I do like that it is smaller than other models, so it takes up less room in the garage. I do not like that it has no support under the seating area. There is nothing between the child and the road except for nylon fabric. Somewhat like sitting in an umbrella stroller. I thought surely there would be some sort of panel that laid in the bottom to shield the child should you hit a bump or pothole unexpectedly. I would not purchase again had I known about this. I would find one that had a bottom to it."
2,Poorly designed seating system,"The seating system in this product is horribly designed and unworkable for one much less two children. The seat is a sling style hung between a rigid upper bar and a nylon strap that extends between the two sides of the frame under the child's legs. The nylon strap cannot be tightened sufficiently and there is not enough seating material slung between the upper bar and the lower strap. As a result the child ends up sliding forward and off the seat - very uncomfortable and unpleasant for the passenger. If you attempt a two child configuration, you'll have two children smooshed together and sliding off. The actual frame and wheel system seems well-designed, but the attachment to the pulling cycle is sub par."
3,no body,promising missing body murder trial storyline doesn't quite jell. imprecise prose and improbable characterizations. average.
3,A Big Disappointment,"I was so looking forward to this DVD. I watched as much of the Teknoman series as possible until it was taken off the air. In Tekkaman Blade II, I found the characters to be highly unsympathetic, espcially Yumi who seemed to be endlessly giggling or suffering the angst of unrequited love. The only 3 characters I cared about were David, Dead End, and D-Boy. The original series drew me in with a fasinating storyline and believeable characters; I cared what happened to the characters, whether they lived or died. I was crushed when the series was taken off the air and am still searching for a place to buy it. So, in short, if you are thinking of buying this because you loved the original series, don't. In this case the sequel does NOT live up to the original."
2,"Director being lazy, don't buy.","The series expand from the first generation of Teknoman, which was really good. The problem is that it is very short. Their biggest enemy is one Teknoman that defeated Blade and it concentrates on that one person. There is a lot of room for improvements. Seen it once and 9/10, I won't see again, it's more of a Japanese film with this one. Characters are goofy and do goofy stuff which didn't have that in Teknoman. If you're a Teknoman fan, go for it, but if you love Teknoman with a good story, to hell with this one."
3,tekkaman blade 2 is weak,I don't speak english very well so please forgive me.I am from Puerto Rico and i recently buy the original version of Tekkaman Blade uncut with all 49 episodes and in japenese audio with english subtitles in a small video club I don't know how they founded but I must say that is much better than Tekkaman Blade 2.If you want to see how the story continues it's okay but don't expected to be as good because is weaker in a lot of aspects like the plot and the colors are too pink.The original is much more dark and the story is a lot better.
4,Inventive Jazz,"Patty waters has always been one of those very few forward thinking jazz musicians that has caught my eye.I have listened to the album ""sing"" and honestly couldn't quite get into it at first. I prefer her more experimental work like the college album.Then I bought this one and was impressed with the warmth the recordings are able to give you. You can't help but truly feel a part of it. The interactions with the producer and patty herself are priceless. The vinyl thumping makes it all very intimate.I'd say if you're into her music in any shape or form then you should be able to appreciate this album."
1,I should have listened to other reviews before buying!,"The Sing-A-Long CD player looks like a good bargain, but it does not play CD's. When it arrived in the mail, we found that it would not play CD's regardless of how we loaded the CD or positioned the player...which of course makes the Sing-A-Long player useless except for the microphone. We shipped it back the next day. Why do they continue to sell a product that doesn't work?? DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I MADE. Avoid it like the plague, folks, and look for another product."
1,doesn't work,Bought this for my nephew for christmas. It does not work. Just makes a clicking sound. WILL NOT PLAY THE CD. This is the 3rd review and none of them work right. DO NOT order this item.
1,This toy is awful,"I bought this CD player for my kids for Christmas. On the 20th I decided to put batteries in it before I wrapped it up. Luckily I decided to test it out. It turns on, but will not spin the CD at all. I tried more than one CD, the unit does not work. I am very disappointed!!!"
3,"Good premise, poor execution","Writing a novel about present day Havana where Danae, a dissatisfied housewife and mother leaves her husband to find her first love, is a great idea. Telling the story from various inanimate objects is a clever way to tell the story from an omniscient narrator. But something gets lost in the process and Valdes takes just a bit too long to tell us their love story. I was able to read 100 pages in one sitting, but I was unable to finish it."
3,Has its moments...,The first 2-3 songs sound like they're from Traffic. Riding High is a good rocker to start the album off with. Then it becomes a Winwood solo project... then alternates between Traffic & a Winwood solo effort. The hints of Irish/Scottish music are very cool. The song writing is strong & I won't speak a bad word about Jim Capaldi's drumming.
2,Bad decision,"Have always been true Traffic/Winwood fan, could never put a real label on their sound; ""jazz-rock""?...a little ""folk"", ""progressive soul-rock""?...anyway, i expected something here resembling ""TRAFFIC"" and found 2/3's of the material sounding like something off the cutting room floor of a Winwood solo album....only a couple of brief instrumental passages came close to getting me to wax nostalgic to the original; final point: Winwood/Capaldi should have gotten a new sax/flute player here to replace Chris (R.I.P.) Wood...you do away with the reed solos and embellishments and you simply don't have Traffic...save your money folks....."
5,Great album,In this album Traffic reunites once more this time influenced by Steve Winwood's Solo Works (you can also hear a bit of Junction Seven coming together )also in this album traffic has been reinvented with the use of the synthesizer and Uileaan PipesI would recommend this album to other listeners1. If you like Steve Winwood's solo works you will love this2. all you fans of keyboards and synthesizers you will like Riding High on this album
3,last traffic,i waited almost fourteen years to buy this disc probably because i didnt deem it to be an important to my collection. it kind of floats along with big ambience but light on guitar and instrumental workouts. a elegiac lament for chris wood.......
2,disappointing,"From the first, revved-up, over-produced beat one becomes aware that this is going to be nothing like an original Traffic recording. For Steve Winwood, the perfection of his early career has not been reclaimed.I, for one, will not give up hope. I think the fact that this cd was made at all was a step in the right direction. I just hope the new Traffic cd will contain a bit of the lost magic."
4,What a nice surprise!,"I stumbled across this album by accident even though I'm an old fan of the group. I didn't expect much at all but it is amazingly good. The production standards are on a par with the best of Steve's solo projects but the songs are allowed to run longer and develop at a slower pace than his ""hits."" More along the lines of classic Traffic, in other words. Fine drumming and percussion by Capaldi, too. And Mr. Winwood's voice is as good as ever. This one flew under my radar when it came out but now that I've found it I can't get it out of my changer."
4,"As for me, I liked it.","A really pretty book about a writer so talented and emotionally in tune as to seem to exist on a different plane than the rest of us. Told from the point of her of her editor. Just a very well written book, tight prose, interesting ideas. Good one."
3,Needs editing,"I agree completely with the comments regarding the poetry in the book -- if you want to illustrate what a great poet someone is, you don't give so many examples of boring, uninspired poetry. A good editor would have gently explained this to the author and convinced her not to include the poetry! The picture of present-day publishing is also pretty skewed; if you believe any publisher would permit an editor to spend so much money on expensive meals for an author who isn't likely to produce any revenue for the company, no matter how well-connected she is, think again.Okay for a first novel, but I expected a whole lot more from the praise for the book on the cover and inside-the-book quotes. Perhaps Cantrell is well-connected herself."
5,NICE SET!,"BOUGHT THIS SET FOR MY DAUGHTER. THEY ARE PLAIN, BUT ELGANT. JUST WHAT SHE WANTED. THE GOLD BOX PRICE WAS A GOOD DEAL ALSO. SHE THINKS I PAID MUCH MORE FOR THEM THAN I DID. heh, heh."
5,excellent product,"Bvlgari Au the Rouge de Bvlgari para los hombres. Eau de Cologne Spray 3.4 Oz. is a premium product, valued beyond price"
1,You Pay For What You Get!,"I had been using this perfume for a couple of years now but it was getting too expensive for my budget nowadays so I decided to look for it online instead of buying at the department store. I found it on Amazon at a surprisingly low price so I immediately ordered one. Unfortunately, I was so disappointed with the product when it came. The cellophane overwrap was not sealed on one end, the box itself did not look original, and the so-called perfume was so watered-down (or alcoholed-down, or whatever they did to it) that it not only smelled a bit odd, but the scent immediately dissipated in a few minutes of wear. I thought that if I was trying to be ""cheap"", I would have been better off getting one of those ""knock-offs"" or ""smell-alikes"" at the mall. I wanted to return it to Amazon but found out that perfume was NOT a returnable product. This was such a waste but surely another lesson learned on ""You Pay For What You Get"" as well as ""Never Buy Perfume Online""!"
3,perfume,"Bought some for my wife. She prefers Beautiful and so do I. It is o.k., but I will not buy anything but Beautiful in the future."
3,Nice easy feel good read,"A good read for a light hearted enjoyment. The heroine is smart and damaged emotionally. The hero strong good looking and ready for a chase, he better be quick this girl just might get away."
4,Enjoyable read and great characters,"The characters made this book. They were very likeable and I wanted them to have a happy ending. I didn't find the story riveting but I liked it well enough and will be ordering Roth's story. The ending was a little confusing to me when all of the pieces were being put together. I was thinking, ""Now who is that?..."" Perhaps if I had read the first in the series I may have been aware more of who some of the villains were..I guess. But overall the story was entertaining and I will continue to read this author."
5,Historical Mystery Novel,'Daring the Duke' by Anne Mallory is historical romance mystery novel based in 1824. Audrey Kendrick is a famous thief who is now being blackmailed to save her sister. Audrey has history with the new Duke Stephen Chalmers but he does remember her saving his life. The Duke finds out who Audrey is and the chance is on ..... This was fun quick read. . I would recommend this novel and The Lady Lies by Samantha Saxon.
5,Great Intake System,This is the second time i have used this product with great outcome. First on an 03 WRX SW and now on an 06 WRX SW. It does make a difference in the throttle response and you can hear it sucking up the air. A definite worthwhile buy.
4,A Beautiful Breyer,"The Andalusian stallion is a beautiful model, but it's not very durable. Mine dropped twice and broke it's pastern on the second time. Luckily, it was able to be repaired and now stands just as proud, majestic, and arrogant as it did before.I recommend it for children ages 10 & up."
4,very good on recorders and other early woodwinds,This book covers early wind instrument construction with the hobbiest in mind. It includes construction drawings and measured pictures. I felt it was best in covering recorders. The Brass instruments were a little shortchanged. I was hoping for a later model clarinet but the one illustrated would be eaiser to build. If you are a woodworker with a Lathe this is a neat book.
4,A Classic!,Fast shipping and video arrived in great shape...as promised! This is one of my favorite movies..a classic! Thanks
5,one of the greatest albums I own,"This is a classic as far as I'm concerned. It's a great psychedelic work, but the guitars are peircingly loud like nothing else I've heard, not like metal-sounding guitars, though. Less distortion, or whatever. It is constant electric howling. At first listen it took some getting used to. These guys remind me of the Doors. It's the vibe. ""Transparent whales always make me feel like I've never been in the right dimension."""
4,"Another fun, light who-dunnit","After reading Cannell's ""The Thin Woman"" I had to immediately find the next Ellie Haskell book and this is it. I was not disappointed. Ellie, who has had her share of disappointments and uncertainties, is fighting another battle. Having recently had twins, she's feeling the overwhelming (but welcome) responsibility of having two adorable babies and is trying to regain her self esteem. It is this quest which leads Ellie smack into the middle of another murder mystery. Once again I enjoyed an entertaining few hours with Ellie and, as in the previous book, was really guessing until the very end."
1,Check your french Dorothy!,It always get me mad when a author deciding to use a foreign language doesn't even bother to verify the spelling and grammar. The correct title should be Femmes Fatales for plural or Femme Fatale for singular
4,Curtain Rod,"This curtain rod was a replacement for one that was damaged in shipment. It was economical, sturdy and is doing the job it was made for."
1,You get what you pay for,"I had my doubts about this rod, but at such a ridiculous price I had to check it out. After all, how hard is it to create a stiff length of metal and then ship it?Well, it's pretty hard. First, the ""metal"" appears to be tin, as this thing bends at the slightest provocation. You can probably hang a bit of lace or plastic from it, but forget it for any actual curtain that has discernible mass. Second, it arrived bent right through the middle. Since the metal is so brittle, attempting to bend it back into shape results in the metal snapping. Finally, even if I *did* attempt to hang something from it, the mounting ""hardware"" is a joke. You get a couple of screws and a piece of what appears to be 4mm diameter wire bent into a U-shape to hang the rod from.Save time and frustration and spend a little extra for the solid stuff."
3,Levolor Kirsch A7004213287 45 to 82-Inch Width Heavy Duty Curtain Rod,"Ordered 2 of these separately. The first arrived okay and works as it should. The second arrived bent up and was dysfunctional. Both shipments were sent in very strong boxes, but something must have happened during packing or shipping. Hardly ""heavy duty"" if you ask me. Worst part is that once bent, you can try to unbend it, but it'll never be 100% functional. I did a pretty good job reshaping mine, but the 2 pieces still bind in places, and it takes a lot of effort to get them to slide to different lengths. Mounting hardware is included."
1,unusable,Bent in two places and the entire rod was bowed out. I tried pliers to fix it but I could not get the rod to extend due to the bowing.. could not fix it.. tossed in garbage
2,Does what it is supposed to do.,The item does what it is supposed to do - it hangs the Disney-Tinkerbell-Flowers-63-Inch-Drape in my daughter's room like we wanted. The problem is the brackets that were included were too small. We ended up having to bend the metal ends in so the brackets fit. There were no instructions so we were pretty scared we weren't doing it right. But it all worked out in the end.
2,Flimsy,Rods were a little on the flimsy side. Shipped from CHINA and took over a month to receive. But what can you expect for $3.00.
5,OFF THE HOOK,This is a must have for Blue Magic Fans. Ted Mills is off the hook with thisone with his great vocals. There are fast tunes and slow tunes. Usually the slow ones stand out and they definitely do on this CD but there is a fast song on this CD that will blow you away. It is too funky-the band is slamming.This is a great CD-simply loved it!!!
5,This does the trick,This product is applied to dry hair. Start the application in the back where your hair is thickest. It only takes a small amount. Very easy to manipulate your hair. Stays in place. Great smell. Love it!
4,Overall good case,"case is good and sturdy. well made. i use it on my LG Env in conjunction with a snap-on shell case. i am used to carrying my phone on my belt on a case so i had to have one when i switched to this phone. the only thing is i expected it to have a swivel belt clip and instead the belt clip is fixed. i thought i saw some other pics online showing it with a swivel belt clip but i guess i was looking at a different model. anyway, overall i'm happy with it."
2,review,this book is a standard military text book. dry data. would be useful in a classroom setting but is vitual useless for personal reading. not reccomended.
5,Great 'hard-to-find' addition to the collection,"First off, I have been listening to Trance (and all its derivations) for more than 15 years now.Space Buddha is an extremely hard-to-find Israeli group who does an absolutely incredible job of spinning Progressive/Psy Trance tracks. Come to think of it.. most Israeli groups/DJ's are hard to find....so if you have the opportunity to pick this up - do it.Aside from the occasional eBay auction, the only place I've been able to find this album is on iTunes - but that's next to pointless if you don't have a good m4p-mp3 converter.The other reviewer is correct - if you are in to GOA Trance, Progressive or if you spin your own - then this will be the album for you.You have to have an ear for this kind of music to tell the differences from the rest - and this one plainly stands alone as one of the best."
1,a typical Sunfire book,"This book had countless flaws, including historical inaccuracy, but I think the most notable one is that the conflict in this book is supposed to be Rachel, the main character, choosing between being an American and a Jew. It briefly sketches what Rachel would gain by being an American, but not once does it mention anything about being a Jew or what she would be giving up by turning her back on her heritage (which, I might add, she does)! What kind of book does not explore the main problem? I also did not care for the assumption that you cannot be an American Jew--you have to choose one or the other. Having Orthodox Jewish American friends, I know for a fact that this is far from true. Also, I actually prefer a main character who has a personality. Rachel was formulated and predictable--your typical Sunfire book."
1,totally unrealistic,"First of all, this book's portrayal of immigrant Jews in the early 1900s was TOTALLY UNREALISTIC! Joshua, a highly observant and traditional 1910 Jew, would NEVER kiss Rachel, a girl he is not even married to, in public. Also, the dialect was unrealistic. (I.e. they would not have said skullcap--they would have used a Hebrew or Yiddush word for this head covering.) I also did not like how it was always Rachel's beauty that opened doors for her. And the book was always talking about how Rachel was trying to choose between her heritage and being an American. It never once attempts to explain exactly what this heritage is or means or what she would be giving up by marrying Nathan. The characters were flat, predictable and two dimensional. Basically, a horrible book."
5,Baptism 101,"Jack Cottrell tackles the subject of Baptism with an understanding that the reader will also be a seeker. Because of that, he approaches the subject with such enormous grace to keep the reader engaged all the way through. No one who reads this book will be disappointed, nor will they be offended by the way he handles the subject matter. I look forward to reading more of his books."
5,Good Technical Accuracy,Sonny Puzikas had a good bit of influence in the technical accuracy of this film and also participated in the acting. The film is one of the best I have seen with the choreography of the fight scenes and action packed firefights. Loved it.
5,Amazon order reviewed,Never got to watch the free rental because would never load to computer or even my phone. Also the video i ordered was just the blue ray and didnt have the digital copy like i was thinking. But couod not retrun do to was out of town when was delivered and was past the return dead line and i couldnt reprint a return label do to the package it was delivered in was thrown away by mistake. However i have always been pleased with Amazon and things i have bought. Guess it my luck just didnt notice it was blue-ra only. I have seen the movie in thet past and love it thats why i wanted it. But i give the movie and Amazon 5 stars.
3,"Stereotypic drugs, cops, cartels.",Nothing creative; in fact mostly borrowed from every other movie ever made about cops & drugs on the streets. Too straight black cop; overbearing haggard white cop; beater old car to cruise the streets; eastern European crime moguls with girls and lots of fire power; black drug gang; people getting shot with an arsenal that would embarrass the US military; lots of physical persuasion by cops upon street people. Generally well acted and directed although a little over the top not-believable and too stereotypic. Ending was too predictable and since it was more of the same stuff it just seemed anticlimactic.
3,Spaghetti Action Film with Plenty of Guns and Gore,"If you like Tarantino, Rodriguez, and old Spaghetti Westerns, you will like Sinners and Saints.The director spins an interesting story about a security detail mission in Iraq that goes wrong. Not all thedetails come together like the audience would like, but most of the characters are fleshed out and the pacing and action move briskly.This movie is full of F-bombs and gratuitous violence and gore, but it is all done in a Spaghetti style adding richly to theatmosphere without taking anything too seriously."
4,Johnny Strong is HOT!,"I was forced to watch this by my boyfriend and it was very violent but still fun. Johnny Strong is so hot, I can't believe I have never heard of him. He makes the movie and is sure to be a big star. Worth checking it out!"
2,Not bad...lots of gun play....so so story,"Not too bad....did not fall asleep, lots of gunplay and violence.... but by theend i wanted the movie to end.And sometime the music did'nt fit the mood of the scenes..good to see once....not a keeper."
5,Every saint has a past and every sinner has a future!,"WOW! WOW! WOW! WOW! WOW! Unexpectedly gripping and suspenseful and action packed. This is a ""buddy cop"" film in its style but it is NOT A RETREAD it tells a story that holds you spell bound from beginning to end. So Much Action!!! Now, if you are a child or a sensitive person this film may not be for you as there is graphic violence. Everyone should buy this film, pop it in the player and get your pop-corn ready for an amazing night with detectives in the Big Easy!"
2,Not very good,"This is a B movie (well, maybe B-). I am not sure if I would even call it ""a renter"". The story line wasn't terrible, although I think that where they decided to take it in the end wasn't very well supported. Of course movie reviews are very subjective, however I recommend that you pass on this one. Our overall grade is whether or not my wife falls asleep during a movie. She did...fail!"
2,"Torture, Mayhem, Violence, Bullets, Blood in New Orleans","""Sinners and Saints"" is a film for action film aficionados; it is billed as ""A city under siege. A man with nothing to lose. ""It has everything folks who enjoy seeing torture, mayhem, violence, bullets, blood, car chases in New Orleans. Frankly, the story was muddled and had something to do with a Russian, a war, drugs, New Orleans Police Department Internal Affairs, but the story never really came through in the film and at the end of the movies, despite watching the ""deleted scenes"" and ""making of the film"" on the DVD, I am no nearer understanding what the film was all about. I also must note that at times I found the background music intrusive and annoying. The film is shot in a color reminiscent of earlier Technicolor times. Most of the acting is credible. Taken in its entirety, I could have passed spending time watching it in favor of something less shallow."
2,"Great movie, bad audio","The movie itself was great - one of my favorites, but the audio is horrible on the disc. Specifically the dialogue. All the other sounds are fine (music, sound effects, etc.), but the dialogue is low and distorted."
1,Great for Lovers of Violence,"Sinners & Saints suggests a storyline built around redemption. But it never delivers, unless you believe that violence is a solution. This movie is filled with talented actors, great special effects and lots of artistic talent. It seems like the idea was to try to produce the next big action hero a la Clint Eastwood of the 21st century. Our hero even appears to cultivate his persona, complete with Gran Torino (if I'm not mistaken, this was his car). The story is promising but not quite complete. There are threads of building intrigue through the script and images. But it all goes nowhere. The dialogue is difficult to understand with excessive expletives and the need for editing. All of the gratuitous violence results in a wreckage of a movie with no redeeming social value. This movie is a waste of talent to me but if you enjoy mindless violence, you will love this movie."
1,Completely Surprised... One of the worst movies I have seen in a long time,"Slow and boring yet gory, Sinners and Saints was so bad that I just had to quit it about 40 minutes into it. Not because something happened that pushed me over the edge, but really because I just decided I would rather go to the bathroom then didn't want to restart when I came back upstairs. I can understand an indie drama about lesbians cowboys eating pudding being this slow, but this was supposed to be an action movie and there just wasn't really anything happening for most of the movie.This review may seem counter to the other ones you read here because for the limited time that there was action is was very in your face (and went out of its way to be gory and ""shocking""), but that was only in the opening sequence. After that... nothing for longer than I was willing to watch. Maybe it got better... maybe it didn't... but you would have to pay me to watch any of it again, so I can't recommend that you spend any money on it."
1,It's a sin that the money was wasted making this movie but at least the crew got work out of it.,"""Sinners and Saints"" is the type of low budget movie that Quentin Tarantino would rave about if it had been made in the 1970's or early 80's. Having said that this is not a cult classic but it's of the same quality that basic cable channels have been churning out for years. It's a bit more stylish looking with a few notable actors slumming it but it's an unimaginative action romp with nothing to distinguish it.The image quality is pretty good for the DVD--the blown out colors and ""look"" of the film is intentional. Audio is very strong.""Sinners and Saints"" is a deriviative movie that, beyond the opening action sequence, has nothing memorable to recommend it."
2,cliched,"I'm not sure if some of the people who gave this movie 5 stars saw the same one I did. It was amateur-ish and cliched. The story was acted well enough, but the writing was just awful. It also had a weird sound editing issue, where you couldn't hear the actors when there was music in the background. Overall, I'd skip this one, it just is not original or interesting."
2,Imagine a Dolph Lundgren or current Steven Segal movie,"The script was poor, the action was very scripted, and the sets were dull. I expected more from this movie since there were a few names in the credits I recognized. Was it worth watching? Probably best to mow the lawn instead. No matter how hard I try, I cant find anything nice to say about this movie other than I'm glad I didn't pay for it."
3,Surprisingly good,"A gritty, cop-action thriller that accomplishes everything it set out to do except make bucks at the box office. This is a straight-to-dvd movie that deserved a better fate. It's a throwback plot with hints of the first ""Lethal Weapon"" in Johnny Strong's lead cop. He's amazingly good in this. Reviewers may rip the indie flick for breaking no new ground, but it's still a gripping story well-told, well-acted and well-directed. The biggest-name star in the cast (Tom Berenger) sleepwalks through his relatively small role, but everyone else is spot-on. The film's main weakness is that it was released in 2012 instead of 1992, when it wouldn't have had to complete for screen time with all the epic 3D mega-blockbusters."
2,Read something else! Dont waste your time!,"This book was a big disapointment for me, the kid I burrowed it from said it was good, but I could not stand it. The characters dont seem real at all, I'm really into all the Samurai, Middle Age stuff and fantasy books but this one just didn't interest me. The characters don't seem real and their dull. I personnally don't like books that are slow getting of, but these L5R get off to fast, by pg. 100 there ready to hack each others heads off. My advice (consitering I have read them all)is go read something worth your time, like The Wheel of Time, the Runelords, Shannara, or find something else, anything."
2,only out of necessity,"the only reason for anyone to read this book is to continue the series. i would have given it a 1 but it continues the story and gives an interesting look at the Crane leader. and am i the only one who found the use of 'domo aragoto' unbelieveably annoying. everytime i read that line i heard 'Mr. Roboto' behind it. i cant stand it when authors intermix languages in their books and in instances like this where its a commonly known phrase that only serves to show the authors complete lack of knowledge about the language. only read this book to continue the series. if in anyway possible rent it from the library or borrow it from someone, but dont waste the money on this piece of.... literature"
1,Read because it's a series.,"I didn't like this book like the first one in Clan War series, but it did not get my trust from L5R. I realized it was not necessary to read this book in order of understanding the following books and the line of the main plot.It's a book without point cuz Unicorn clan is very weak, a bunch of characters without background in a foresaw quest."
4,Great read,An excellent story and a must read as part of the series. Gives you a nice viewpoint of other clans and also a good look into what its like from the standpoint of non-royalty. The only downfall is wanting to see more of what happens to the characters.
5,Unicorns do it Right!,"This book started out ok, and then got better, and towards the end I couldn't put it down. Following the dual story of Tetsuko's breathless life of battle and Tadaji's dreams and palace intrigue was a stark contrast at first, but once the threads between them become clearer, it all fell into place. The whole book is full of brilliant images and characters. The plot's foreshadowing had me guessing and flipping back to re-read and see if I had guessed right. At one point I even read ahead because I couldn't stand the suspense (and I never do that)! Like Jikkyo, ""No matter what happens tomorrow, it will be with you always..."""
3,"Better than ""The Scorpion"" (small spoiler)","This one deals with the beginning of the Clan War, beginning with the aftermath of the Plague and ending with the Battle of Beiden Pass. I liked this one better than the previous one wich, IMO lacked drama and intensity. This one is lower key, but doesn't fail to deliver. Plenty of guest stars... Sukune on a Stick, Yori, etc..."
3,Games are not so interesting..,"product works without any problems. Based on the previous reviews i read in amazon, I expected lot from this product. But this is very ordinary. Games are not interesting at all. Not sure if kids will like this or not. I personally did not like the games."
2,Dum Dum Doom,"Wow, it's like. . . I'm like, scared, man. Too much Doom, dude. Might make you puke until you laugh, though. Give it a try if the ipecac doesn't work (yawn)."
4,Great geology; too much global warming,"I was hoping for a book that would help me learn to look at and ""read"" rocks and perhaps tell me the geological history of some interesting places, but while this book doesn't do that at all, I enjoyed the geology. Unfortunately the last third of this short book is all about global warming and how humans risk changing the earth in drastic ways. We need to know about this, but that's not what I wanted or expected from this book. Still, I found the book well-written, clear, and interesting. Now where's a book for me on learning to read the rocks?"
3,Info is good but the attitude isn't.,"The information is good but the attitude isn't. I was too turned-off by the cynicism in this book to take the author's passion of geology seriously. I am a geology lover, but the book is filled with cynical comments and the introduction "" ...but everyone agrees that nothing of significance - that is, nothing worthy of scholarly scrutiny - has ever happened here in this beer-drinking burg on the north shore of Lake Winnebago in Wisconsin"" is ignorant and unnecessary. There are better ways to get people interested in geology than by dissing the local history (of which there is a lot: major trade-routes, logging, shipping to name a few). I don't care for a book written with such a narrow-minded attitude."
5,Superb,"For anyone not lost in a speciality, but also not a generalist lost in nowhere...This ties not only geology, but socio-Anthropological and Evolutionary issues in a tidy knot,they are really in, perhaps even a Helix.And as a conclusion asks a simple question to us all...With all the Kings Men""Experts"" around their failed Humpty-Dumpty USA.....are these the same ""guys"" we want to create the first ""Black Hole"" in Texas,and take over the Mangement of ""Human Evolution""?Remins us only too coldly, there could be a not so ""Silent Winter""."
4,Good primer on modern geology,"Very enjoyable, non-technical intro to contemporary geological thinking, with an historical approach. Not the history of geology so much, but the history of the Earth. Ms. Bjonerud writes interestingly and well and seems to know her stuff. That's all I ask for in this kind of book."
3,MIddle ground should be found,"Very inspiring book. Lots to think about. Though I find it radical to the extreme. We do not need to go that far to make our children happy. I definitely find a lot of brilliant ideas that i can use in my own family. I agree that kids do need more freedom and they can make great decisions and we should let them do that most of the time. However they need us to introduce them to the world. Not to dictate them what to do but to open the doors. How much can a child know. He is rather limited in his idea of the world at the early age. Should we let him be where he is or should we take him to the different levels and offer him to expand his creativity , knowledge, experience. What we need is an education system that is inspiring, creative and at the same time opens the potential of each and every individual child."
4,A perspective worth looking into.,"I am a college student majoring in education and I chose to read this book for class studies. I believe that in todays society that a ""Summerhill"" would not survive in the United States. Summerhill was established in a time period in which boundaries and freedoms were earned. Principles of child rearing and the Summerhill philosophy often contradict real world events of today. The Summerhill idea helps build a stronger foundation for my teaching career."
2,Dreaming of Educational Utopia in OZ,"I selected this book as part of my education course requirement. I found the views of ""Summerhill"" incompatible with the youth of todays turbulent society. I feel that youth have been given the reigns of freedom far to long. The concepts which A.S. Neil promotes in this book do not differ to greatly from that of the Wizard Of Oz. I do feel that there are many quality ideas and points that are revealed in this book and hopefully many will apply to the coming generations. For now theres no place like home."
3,Not the best,"The movie was hard to follow especially since I don't know all of the history of Ireland. Maybe once I read the book, it will make more sense."
2,Barely any scent,The sticks and the lil holder and the lil box it comes in are all nice but this incense just doesn't do it.I can barely tell whether or not I like the scent.I got this product for its good reviews but I'm just not pleased.
5,Excellent book,This is an excellent book that any success conscious person should read. It is a book for high motivation individuals.
5,A lot easier to read than the Physicians Desk Reference,"The PDR tells you all the problems with side effects with drugs--I use it all the time to look up drugs as a medical secretary. However, this book is a lot easier to read for a layperson."
5,A great eye opener on prescription drugs.,The copy I have read was published in 1997 by Harmony books and probably pretty much similar to this 1998 edition. Dr. Bosker displays a great courage in exposing some of the money savings the managed care organizations. Dr. Bosker explains that generics are possibly not as effective as originals but they are pushed anyway to save money. How many of us were repeatedly assured that they use same chemicals and they are same. You will love MedRANK Life checklists and find out if your medications are the optimal ones subscribed for the ailment. I enjoyed the book and consider it a gift of service to all of us by Dr. Gideon Bosker.
5,Sweet and spell-binding tale,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book! The sweet story of Emily Harding, thrown 100 years back in time, to right wrongs made during the Civil War is touching and humorous. I love how pieces of the history of Cabell County WV are shown, as I grew up there. I think this book is a excellent, and would make a great addition to any library (I even bought several as gifts!)."
3,ok product,"its a good caulking gun for light use only, if to much pressure is put on cartridge it tends to bend or come apart from the gun. Besided that its a sturdy gun...."
3,I only LOVE 4 songs on this...,"I love tracks 10, 44, 45, and 46 -THEY RULE!!!!It's funny, this happens to me alot where I LOVE barely a few songs and the rest of the songs irritate me...I guess that makes me not much of a Minuteman fan? But that's how I am with alot of bands I love so...I don't know."
1,This is a photo book?,"You'd expect a book of just photographs to have good photos, but this one doesn't. The photos are grainy and poorly cropped. I've seen the same photos in other books that look much better. The captions are also awful - very simplistic and general such as not specifying the type of tank or type of gun in a picture."
5,Insight on Artistry,"Carol Montparker writes with insight, warmth, and sensitivity. She has great feeling for the difficulties and rewards of the pianist's vocation. She expresses appreciation to the famous pianists she has interviewed for Clavier Magazine, and yet she speaks of her students with respect, also. Her insights into the challenges facing a pianist and her reverence for the art form make this book eminently worth reading."
1,Cheap quality rod!,The rod was bent when arrived so had to carefully straighten it as best I could without snapping it in half. The middle extension piece did not fit easily (much too tight) and could only insert part way without buckling the whole thing. I have it hung up temporarily until I can get a better rod. I think $12 was way too much to pay for this flimsy rod. (it didn't even have the soft rubber guards that fit on the extension ends so as to not snag your sheers) I thought because it was priced higher that it would be nicer quality but I've paid $5 or $6 for similar rods that were much better quality. I got ripped off on this one.
4,Good basic rod,This is your basic white curtain rod. Nothing fancy but it works well. I would not however use it on heavy curtains. It does have the center bracket but I don't think it would hold up to heavy curtains being opened and closed often.
2,HEAVY duty curtain rod,"The rod says heavy duty and it was like any other curtain rod I purchase. Since I needed 120"" I wanted a heavy duty rod. When rod arrived the end that goes into the bracket on the wall was bent. I unbent it so it would fit on the bracket. For a plain curtain rod it would have been fine but advertising as heavy duty it wasn't."
2,so disappointing,"they finally arrived and you can't imagine how disappointed i was when i couldn't get the zipper even halfway up my calves!! i am a size 2/4. i'm 5'2"" and petite. even my feet are small (the size 6 is too big for me)! i barely exercise so it's not as if i have muscular calves. but these boots don't fit! my fingers actually hurt from trying to get the zipper up just a little bit farther, in the hopes that i could somehow wear them. but these boots are made for girls who have nothing but skin and bones for legs.i would have given them 1 star but i love everything else about them. i'm just not willing to starve myself for them. hopefully i get a full refund."
1,Clean book,"Of one of many books on this subject, there's nothing really new here-but Ann does attempt to at least be brief, which the majority of other books are not. As an instructor of manuscript writing at a major medical school, I find, however, that the advice in this book does not really hit at the heart of the problems most inexperienced authors face, and sadly, few of them will learn from this book. I'm somehow not surprised that one reviewer of this text, who herself is an instructor of writing at Yale, writes phrases like ""writing up ... results"". The fact is, the majority of instruction for writing on this subject is sadly uninformative."
2,"God says: Buy COP KILLER, the uncensored album.","This album lacks a lot of the controversy (not all of it) of the original, uncensored ""Cop Killer"" (new censored version now titled Body Count). Go to eBay and find someone auctioning off the real version of the 92 album. You will like it a hell of a lot better."
2,Okay,Its is okay if you are a dbz fan but it is horrible graphics and it gets boring fast. i have played better games but it is a okay game.
1,haha stay away,weak sauce cant believe people used to pay 200 bucks for this game back in the early 2000's. lol painful game. the original copies of this game i can understand MAYBE being collectible. but when dbz budokai 2 was released for ps2 a BUNCH of copies of this dbgt ps1 game were redistributed by the people releasing budokai 2 . this game is by far the WORST db game ever made. it is not a collectible and was only considered a collectible briefly because of americas ignorance. for 5 bucks it may be worth. just to laugh at the campiness. dont take my word for it buy it as a trophy collectible waste your money. but do yourself a favor. youtube the game play.
2,Poor quality picture!,"Still love the songs, but boy, the film quality is just terrible. No idea if it was like this originally, but compared to any other DVD or TV we have (including some old sesame streets), this picture is nigh on unwatchable. You've been warned!"
2,free to be,"I used to use this video when teaching kindergarten, and loved it then, when it first came out. It seems a bit dated now."
3,Where's the rest of it?,"Frankly, I was a bit disappointed by the product. I had owned the album back in the late 70s and there were more songs, stories, etc. on the album than appeared on this DVD. Some of my favorites were missing."
5,marlo thomas,Marlo thomas has done a billiant job with this video its amazing a mut have for any child get it today !~
5,Came fast and completely satisfied!,"good quality movie, we are really glad we got this. My son loves the music and sings to all the songs."
5,Impossible Not to Love.,"You get good moral lessons in self respect for both genders, great music, and something the entire family can share. I grew up with this TV show as a kid in the early 70s, not unlike many others here, and have never forgotten the timeless messages that permeate its presentation. Free to Be You and Me is for kids of all ages in any generation. One of my favorites is when Marlo Thomas and Mel Brooks are the voices of the babies, but my absolute favorite, which can't be of much surprise, is the New Seekers singing the title track. Between this and most anything Sid and Marty Krofft have ever put out, I feel fairly confident that out-of-date to some people means nothing to small children who just love to be entertained and learn valuable lessons. I love to sit and watch this sort of thing with them, we can have a great time doing it, and we can hope the generation behind us will embrace it and spread the love. After all, isn't that how the Wizard of Oz became a classic?"
3,Free To Be You And Me DVD,"This DVD was OK, but not as good as I thought it would be. I listened to the record albumover and over again when it came out. In fact, my co-workers and I put on a show forenlisted men and their families in Germany back in 1975, doing many of the songs from thisshow. I do love the music."
2,Anti-Bias Resource,"I like the content/message, but would appreciate seeing more diversity in the characters. I think I will stick with the audio version. May choose to use dvd as a tool to discuss the lack of minorities in visual arts media."
3,"Sadly dated, get the CD","I vaguely recall bits and pieces of video from my childhood, but it was still a bit of a shock when I got the DVD. The CD seems unfortunately timeless, but the DVD looks very very dated. Some of the animations (e.g. ""Atalanta"" and ""William's Doll"") aren't too bad, but the rest is too 70s. Get the CD instead, you'll be much happier."
2,my kids did not like,"i loved this as a kid, but my kids (age 4 and 1) are bored with it. they have no desire to see it again, which is my test of whether it was worth it. so, nope, waste of money."
5,Must-have kids' video,"I never tire of the great songs and important messages in this video. My son loves it, and I always tear up a little when I see Rosie Greer sing ""It's Alright to Cry."" I know it seems a little dated, but the messages about gender equality still ring true today."
1,Quality of DVD is horrible,"Like many before me, I watched this as a kid in school for several years and was surprised to see a DVD release. The DVD has versions of songs not on the CD (a young Michael Jackson for example).BUTThe DVD quality is pretty bad. It looks like someone put a video camera on a tripod and pointed it at the wall showing the old film on a screen (complete with things blocking the view) - I'm serious. They didn't remaster it or even do a quality transfer.This may be the only version you will see on DVD so holding off may not be wise if you have no other copy. I pulled a copy from Showtime a LONG Time ago and it's MUCH MUCH MUCH better than the DVD. How sad..."
5,Excellent programming for children,"I remember seeing this when I was a child back in the 70's & it's been a real treat to find it & rediscover it again. Now all the children in our family will get their chance to see these excellent cartoons, skits & songs and maybe even benefit from the decent programming it provides."
4,vaudeville for committed liberals,"I just watched this for the first time in 30+ years. I forgot how much squishy liberal dogma was in there, but the songs sure are catchy. Curiously, my kids weren't interested in it at all, but my wife and I wanted to watch.P.S. Listen to Marlo Thomas with your eyes closed. Her singing is terrible!"
5,tommy tricker and the stamp traveler,"hi, brian from saskatchewan canada here,just want to let everyone out there to know about this great low budget corney canadian movie, i seen it when i was a kid and loved it ever since,i admit it is corney but that's what is good about it it is a feel good cuddley movie,very innocent would be great for kid's and family. it is about a boy that finds a magical stamp that he can shrink himself and travell around on the stamp to different countries,lots of adventure some light comedy, you will be hooked if you just give it a chance,i did and here i am 22 years old and still watching it."
3,Tommy Tricker and the Stamp Traveler,"This is a movie from my children's childhood. Now they want to share it with their children. It was probably an afterschool special or appears to be made for television in quality, but holds great sentimental value for our family."
5,"BUY IT YOU""LL NEVER GET TIERED OF IT!!!","I watched this movie as a kid , and never forgot the words to the song I'm Running thats in it. I love this movie the characters are brilliant .The story is great . You'll love all the different locations Montreal Canada, Australia, China. It makes everyone wish they could ride a stamp and visit any country they wish ! An adventerous fantasy you'll never forget."
4,"a really cute film, what I saw anyway!","I just saw this movie for the first time the day after christmas, and I was half asleep then woke up to that weird song, but it was very catchy! The movie was surprisingly entertaining, to be of Canadian origin! Anyway, too bad its not available on video, I would enjoy seeing the film in its entirety!"
3,Blast from the past,This is an older movie from my daughter's childhood. Couldn't pass it up when I saw it was available. Not the greatest plot however.
2,"Great for nostalgia, but horrible movie","I began searching for this movie a few years ago, because I loved it as a child. Clearly nostalgia stays strong and memory fades because I had no recollection whatsoever of just how horrible this movie is.For starters, it drags on soooo incredibly long before anything happens with the stamp traveling. It was literally over an hour before any action happened. Everyone in the movie seems to be an avid stamp collector- men on the streets, people in China, Australian mad men...that was so unbelievable! The plot is probably the worst out of any movie I've EVER SEEN!!! The acting was horrible beyond belief.Despite my nostalgia, I don't even know if I'll let my children watch this movie, for fear of insulting their intelligence. Too bad I can't get my money back..."
1,All Flash and no Substance,"Enuff said! I didn't want to give this show any stars, but they wouldn't let me!!!! It's silly and childish and the two leads were not very good actors. All I ask is what was the fuss about? I answer: NOTHING!"
5,Good quality,The item was in very good condition and I was very pleased with the way it came promptly.
4,I'm happy...,I'm not a big fan of buying 'old tv' on DVD but I gladly made an exception for Vice. I loved this show when it was on and have longed to drop back into that pastel-noir world again. You can't do without this as a Vice fan.
3,Music sound track is A+ however.....,"Finally Miami Vice is available on dvd after watching the entire season 1, I can only give it 3 star rating. The good news - Universal did indeed retain the original soundtrack the 5.1 sound is fairly good given its age (20 years old). The bad news - Universal probably transcribe the episodes over from the vhs prints all the episodes looks grainy and colors bleed (especially red), I have play the discs on a regular crt & my 1080p hdtv - the picture looks worst on hdtv all of the grain shows. Even more puzzling its that other Universal titles (which I own) like Columbo, McCloud which are older looks better than Vice (!) So please rent the set before dropping your hard earned $$$ on season 1."
5,One of my favorite tv shows!,"I have Miami Vice season 1 on dvd and its awesome. However the company Universal should work hard to make it better qualified cause the Pilot on my dvd cuts off in the middle of the episode and it doesn't read the disc, I know its not normal but I have no problem with the other episodes. I can't wait to get season 2 cause I'm going to work for it, I love Miami Vice and the style of it, I'm also looking forward to the Miami Vice movie, I saw the teaser of it and it looks awesome.Miami Vice will live on to be the greatest shows of our time and I always enjoy it."
5,Get Miami Vice on DVD,Miami Vice was and always will be the best cop show ever. Alot of us are really wanting it to come out on DVD.
4,"It's not the heat, it's the humidity","I was very much looking forward to the release of Miami Vice on DVD. It transported me back 20 years, rushing home to catch the heat on NBC on Friday nights.I have to say it does not disappoint. Loved the show. Was extremely disappointed to see they had not fixed up the visuals though - neg dirt is clearly visible, and it could have definitely used a colour correction. Yet...they obviously spent their time on mixing in 5.1....why do one and not the other? What a waste.Having said that, it's still a lot of fun to watch. Looking forward to Season 2, here's hoping it won't be 3 years before it arrives."
5,HURRY UP WITH SEASON 2!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This show was probably the best show of the 1980's with it's smooth music, nice attitude and two badass cops. i really wish they would hurry up with season 2!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Pilot Missing 1/2,Pilot episode -- the reason I bought the set--is missing the thrilling conclusion. All the music and close ups of Daytona California vehicle missing. Confrontation with drug lord missing. Iconic shots of Miami missing.
5,ONE OF THE BEST TV SHOWS EVER,"THIS SERIES TURNED MIAMI INTO THE ""HOT SPOT"" IT IS TODAY. IT CHANGED THE FORMAT OF TV SERIES. A PERFECT CAST. MUCH BETTER THAN THE RECENT MOVIE."
3,So-so transfers,"I've always liked the series. Parts of it haven't aged too well, but overall, it's still fun to watch. The only complaint I have is that the transfers are not that good. Not one scene is clear and crisp like a DVD transfer should be. For the price tag, it should've been better than that."
2,I bought all 111 episodes of Miami Vice on DVD allready,"Well, since they are not releaseing them onto DVD after I spoke with a rep at universal; (Nicky Warren)due to music rights. As of 5/26/04 there is an official word that it will not be possible to release them onto DVD. SO I BOUGHT THEM ALL ON DVD FROM A GUY THAT HAS DONE AN INCREDIBLE JOB AND I MEAN AND INCREDIBLE JOB PUTTING THEM ALL IN ORDER AND VERY SUPERIOR QUALITY. The gentleman that created these DVDs said it would be okay to release his website; so here it is (...) www.miamivice.org (...) if you want to contact him. I will gladly offer my refference after what I have purchased, made me very very happy!! Good luck Vice fans. Hope this onformation helps you in your search!"
3,"The 1st Season is Fair, but wait for Season 2 and 3","he season 2 and 3 are much better. Bruce Davidson, Willie Nelson, Ted Nugent are not in season one, you will have to wait for season 2 and 3 to get the best shows. Still season one is ok."
2,Miami Vice,"I love Miami Vice, but this presentation of the show has pretty lame extra features (I can't believe they call it that) and the episodes are on each side of the cd. It has the feel of being quickly produced with not much thought. With that said, I do love the show, so the quality of the actual episodes is good."
3,Sensory appealing but intellectually dull.,"PROS: If you are looking to get your groove on Miami Vice will really stimulate your senses both visually and audibly. This was a television breakthrough from a technology perspective. This series also had a huge influence on fashion in the 80's. If you want the nostalgia or the history of the 80's you will like this series.CONS: On the other hand, if your looking for deep, interesting characters and interesting screenplay writing this is not for you. Don Johnson is a sub par actor and his character is not believable. Even worse is Daniel Day Lewis who barely utters a word and is hardly given any dialogue to work with. He looks stone faced most of the time and never changes expression or gets too excited. One bright spot is Jimmy Smits. The screenplays seem to repeat themselves. Another drug bust, corrupt government, business, the quick buck, a broken heart, lots of violence and boat chases. Yawn!"
1,Disappointed in DVD quality,"This is a super show, great soundtrack, video quality very good, but the 2 sided discs just ruin it. My DVDs skipped and got hung up right out of the box, this is going back to Amazon, I am sure all copies will do the same thing so I guess I will just get a refund and forget about having this show on DVD."
5,AWESOME!!!,"I loved this series when it was on television!!! It was so much fun to watch! I was attending my first year of college when this show was well on its way to becoming a great cult classic. But something funny happened. It actually got ""cool."" And people caught on to the Vice clique!I can remember even buying two ""Miami vice"" style jackets, a grey one, and a black one. Okay, I stopped short of wearing no socks, and pull on shoes. But actually I take that back. I did have the pull on shoes. But I did wear socks!Okay, enough about me! I loved this freshman season of the Miami Vice franchise! It was AWESOME! It was so much fun to watch Pen Jillete and Phil Collins, and even that father from ""Married with Children"" in surprise roles. A surprise, because these ""character"" actors were early in their prime, and all have established careers now.I would recommend this for any hardcore Vice fan, and as a rental for all others.Two thumbs up!MC White said: Check it out!"
4,True to the show,"If you are a fan of Miami Vice, you won't be disappointed with this set. It is fantastic!!"
4,"A huge fan, but disappointed with the DVD","I LOVE Miami Vice and was so excited the DVDs were being released, but I am not happy with the discs. I love the cover art and think that was well done, but why the dual-sided discs that require your having to manually flip them over to get to the other episodes????? For the price of this release, why not just make a 6-disc set (one sided discs)? Other than that (and no inside booklet--episodes are listed on the back of the slip cover), the set is great. Maybe they'll get it right for season 2--I hope!"
1,poor guality dvd's,"i buy merchandise from Amazon quite often, usually with success. whenever i purchase an item from a company that works through Amazon. i've received poor quality products. i found it's best to buy new from Amazon."
2,"Dual sided discs FREEZE, JUMP, STUTTER, ETC!","AGAIN,UNIVERSAL RUINS ANOTHER GREAT SERIES WITH THE USE OF DUAL SIDED DISCS. THE ONLY REASON FOR THIS IS TO SHORTCHANGE THE CONSUMER. I WILL NOT BUY DUAL SIDED DISCS, PERIOD. I HAVE 4 SETS OF OTHER SERIES FROM UNIVERSAL I RECEIVED AS GIFTS ON DUAL SIDED DISCS. THEY FREEZE, JUMP, SKIP, ETC. I'M GLAD I DIDN'T PAY FOR THEM. UNIVERSAL REFUSES TO REPLACE THEM. SO SORRY UNIVERSAL YOU WON'T GET ONE DIME OF MY MONEY!I GUESS THEY HAVEN'T HEARD OF DUAL LAYER DISCS, OR SINGLE SIDED DISCS WHICH ARE CHEAP ENOUGH. UNIVERSAL TAKE A CLUE FROM PARAMOUNT WHICH DOES AN ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC JOB WITH THEIR SERIES-ALL EPISODES ON SINGLE SIDED DISCS, EACH IN IT'S OWN SINGLE OR DOUBLE DISC CASE AND THEN SLIPCOVERED. MISSION IMPOSSIBLE WAS FANTASTIC. WB AND SONY ARE ALSO FANTASTIC WITH THEIR SHOWS AS WELL."
4,Good quality except for the glitches,"I, too have encountered the glitch in the pilot episode that others have mentioned. It's impossible to get by it, so you lose the best part of the pilot episode. Otherwise, the sound and pic are very good, considering that this show was made in the early 80s and no one had heard of 5.1 sound and HDTV."
5,Miami Vice DVD's on the way.......,"To all those, like me, patiently waiting for Miami Vice on DVD, you might not have to wait too much longer. Sources at Universal have informed me that they are currently clearing the music for a worldwide release of season one in 2005. Big money is being spent on this, and good sales would lead to season 2, all being well."
5,Magical,"A beautifully realized excursion into a magical world. My attention never wavered as I was struck by one completely unfamiliar concept or scene after another. Often fantasy works leave me a bit cold with the Shakespearean posturing and ambiguous dangers that any variety of spells can be used to bail out of but, this matter-of-fact tale of wonder needs no pretensions and achieves majesty quite easily."
5,My First Anime,"My boyfriend recommended this movie to me. At first I was not very interested because it was Anime. I had never watched a movie like this before. You have to have some prior knowledge of Japanese customs to fully comprehend the concept of this movie. There are points in this movie where it makes you jump. Some scenes you feel so bad for the characters. I recommend this to anyone who wants to see a sensitive yet slightly action-filled movie. This is really a great movie. I liked it so much that I bought it a week after I first saw it, and as you can see its no cheap buy. But I recommend that you get yourself a copy, it's worth it."
5,SUPER EXCELLENT,"Ok, if any of you haven't seen this movie yet, you have GOT to, no matter how old you are. I expected this movie to be pretty good (since it is directed by Miyazaki), but it was probably the BEST anime movie I have ever seen in my life,and I have seen quite a bit of anime. I think that if this movie were any better, it would just explode. It has something for everyone, lots of adventure, a bit of romance, some drama, comedy, and magic, all rolled up into this super movie. Plus, the music is just enchanting, I was spellbound by it at once, especially ""Always With Me"". The beginning of the flick is a bit boring, but as the plot unfolds, you find yourself mesmerized by the whole thing, and you feel as the characters would feel. I'm just rambling on, and on, but this has hardly even begun to tell about how great this movie is. Bottom line: SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!!"
5,One of the best anime films out there,"You don't have to love anime to appreciate this film, but it helps! I consider myself a picky anime lover; not all will do but a few will blow me away, and this is one of those few. Spirited Away has a great overall moral to it's story: growing up and becoming selfless. In the beginning, our protagonist, Chiyo, is your typical teen. But when forces beyond her control leave her to fight to save her parents, she surprisingly steps up to bat. With each trial and tribulation, Chiyo discovers that perhaps there are more important things in life, a bigger picture if you will. Now, this is done in Miyazaki's crazy way of storytelling, but if you're open culturally, this film's for you."
5,amazing,this film is so imaginative ...it was a great film ....good for children and adults...i watched this with my son and we both enjoyed it...truly an amazing film....i would highly recommend !!!!!!
5,Enjoy both of English version and French version,I have seen Japanese original version. I wanted to see both of English version and French version. The translations are quite accurate. I could enjoy how to express in other languages.
2,Why?,"why is this movie so popular? i dont have the answer. it is really long, and a bunch of strange magical things keep happening one after the other including some stupid things like ""if you become afraid at all, they can see you!"". it started so smartly but then went downhill so quickly.i like animated movies and loved shrek. but this is just plain silly movie."
2,Went to the movies to see it - I shouldn't have,"We were young and in love with the art and originality in/of 'Princess Mononoke'. That's the excuse I'm giving for paying to see this... film. A huge disappointment for sure, but I've reconciled with our mistake. I'll be sure not to make the same one with the new movie that's set to come out later this year."
3,An epic only because needless segments weren't cut,"This movie drags on with very few moments to keep you interested. I think it is cultural differences, though Japanese animation is truely inferior to Disney classics. However I give it three stars because the director seemed to put his heart into it and tried to be as original as possible. The sad thing is, with all its originality it hardly entertained me or moved me."
3,I tried to like this,"I like every Miyazaki work I've watched except Spirited Away. The girl's parents turned into greedy pigs! I won't watch this. I'm glad someone else shared my view and wrote a similar review. Buying this DVD for my mother on mother's day would be a hurtful insult.I watch a lot of Japanese animes and the art work for Spirited Away does not strike me as being better than many others. The characters are not charming, I'm not impressed. The award should have gone to Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind or Howl's Moving Castle."
5,"Art, yes. Plot, no.","I have to rate this five stars, despite the eco-babble plot, because the artistry is overwhelming. Miyazaki's ""Spirited Away"" is fine art. Disney's marketing strategy worked just fine, as far as I can tell -- that is, limited release, followed by limited release even unto Des Moines, Iowa, rewarding expected behavior by animeniacs, followed by release to DVD. Excellent. This is literally like owning an original Picasso, and as the shelf life of Disney's chosen DVD surface media gradually erodes over the next 0.5 decades or so, the few surviving copies may even accumulate fiduciary, as well as superbly aesthetic, value. The plot is typical Miyazaki ecology maunderings; if you could stand it in Mononoke Hime, you can stand it in Sen to Chihiro. It's a minor defect, what Hitchcock used to call the ""McGuffin."""
2,"Good, but not great","What I heard most about this movie before I actually saw it was that it is a great story. The concept is interesting, the movie has great beginning but then it sort of wonders aimlessly to a point of actually being boring. Not in the same league as ""Lion King""."
1,Ugh!,"Ummm, whatever you want to say, this is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen! The plot was confusing throughout the film, the characters were stupid, and the movie had no point! The only element that redeemed this picture in my eyes was the boy who helped the idiotic girl try to rescue her idiotic parents so they could go back to their idiotic world! Don't waste your time."
1,Creepy Movie,"This is, by far, one of the creepiest movies that I've ever managed to actually sit through. I love anime, but can't quite understand why this one has become quite so popular. The backline (with family) is a great story, but the whole spirit storyline gets very farfetched and downright creepy. This could cause nightmares in children and adults."
1,How can you see such crap?,"I was realy disapointed when I heard that this bad graffic childish fairytale won an Oscar. What is wrong with all of you, haven't you have enough from all this Japan made crap?"
1,"Perhaps the worst movie ever made, an insult to man kind.","Oh. My. God. What is the matter with you people? I think the people who put together this vile mass of odor have serious mental issues. I couldn't watch it. It was so painfully disturbing, that I was sure my eyes were literally bleeding! This movie is a threat to society! Don't watch it! Don't buy it! Save yourselves!!!"
5,Wonderful,"I saw this movie for the first time this weekend, and I was blown away. This is a wonderful story - it has everything I love about Wizard of Oz and Labyrinth, the crazy creatures in the alternate magical world, the coming-of-age of the protagonist, a great emotional punch - with superb animation and direction. I highly recommend this movie. It's beautiful."
4,Awesome,The movie is a funny as any Disney movie. The characters are as interesting as those of Lewis Carol ( my favorite are the frog in the Kimono and the little mouse) The colors are beautiful and crisp and the background art is so realistic. Great movie.
1,Spirited Away,"i cannot play it on my dvd player. It is not formatted for the USA. I cannot send it back because it will cost me more for postage than the cost of the dvd.When I purchased it., it gave me no indication that I could not use it in my dvd player."
4,Pretty good.,"Good movie. However, be wary that younger children might find it frightening, there's a scene where a monster consumes another creature. Other than that, it was enjoyable. Miyazaki is a master."
4,Excellent Work!,Anime as art. Miyazaki's genius shines wonderfully in this animated movie. The creativity is unmatched except by the animation itself.
4,A superior version of Alice in wonderland,"This movie reminded me of a slightly more manic version of Alice in Wonderland. The viewer is introduced to a world that is devoid of logic. As I watched on, I felt like a child entering a circus for the first time. Everything was new, colourful, bizarre and exciting. This is probabily the reason why I liked this movie so much. It's as if I had kalidoscope eyes. I like movies that take me away from reality and this one did it for me. To their credit, the animators were able to capitalize on the medium by creating scenes and elements that would be difficult if not impossibe to create with real actors. Saying that, I thought ""The adventures of baron munchausen"" was quite successful in acheiving that. I have a feeling that this movie would appeal more to adults than kids because it restores some sense of imagination that we lost while we grew up."
5,Enchanting! My first Anime purchase!,"My wife and I love this film. Anime isn't usually ""our thing,"" but this film goes beyond all else!"
4,Not for children with short attention spans!,"The story and the animation are great! The story starts off immediately, but the movie is long! Children love different parts but some of the references are totally Japanese and lost on American audiences. Certain characters are mesmerizing, the movie and the animation are wonderful. The little girl's action and behavior are realistic to human child behavior. Fate is portrayed with a recognizable mask. This was a very absorbing picture, though very, very long. Over 3 hours! I loved the spider'scharacter. Simply wonderful!"
5,rating,"Ordered the wrong thing. Needed a dvd but still kept the movie as I also have a vhs. I was very pleased with the cost, dellivery time and movie in great condition. Thanks"
5,Spirited away,this is a movie that is fantasic keeps you glued to the screen for the whole two hours how often can an amnimated movie do that no wonder i won the best animated feature award
5,Simply Amazing,"I must admit that if it weren't for my friends, I probably would have never even given this title a second look, but after I watched it, I was amazed. Miyazaki has managed to create one of the most beautiful, not to mention entertaining, movies I have ever seen. The characters (especially Chihiro) are very true to life. I highly recommend ""Spirited Away"" even if you aren't an anime fan or, like me, are an otaku (you know who you are). I also encourage you to check out Miyazaki's other works, two of my favorites being ""Princess Mononoke"" and ""The Castle of Cagliostro."""
5,Simply wow....,"There's only one word to summarise this movie, 'wow!'. It's a movie well done and is one of the best movies in the modern era. I've seen it for a countless number of times and still continue to do so, and each time I do, I watch it as though I am watching it for the very first time.If you haven't seen this movie yet, I recommend you to buy it rather than rent it. I promise that you won't be disappointed =)"
5,One worth buying,"This movie is an excellent film. Keep in mind, this movie is the anime style. If you prefer traditional, ""happy-go-lucky"", easy to follow animated films, this movie probably isn't for you. I found that I could watch this movie more than once and get something different out of it each time. I really appreciate that in a film. However, it does have the ever so common flaw, which happens in a lot of anime productions, of being rushed plot-wise in some places [the ending, namely]. They probably ran out of time and/or budget. The english dubbing isn't bad...I've heard worse. However, if you have a chance, do watch it in Japanese. All in all this movie is a wonderful, beautiful movie that is well worth adding to your collection."
5,JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE......,"I WAS BLOWN AWAY BY THIS MOVIE JUST LIKE WHAT THAT DUDE SAID IN THE BEGINNING. IT WAS SO AWESOME, I CAN'T EVEN EXPLAIN. ANIME, CARTOONS, WHATEVER YOU CALL IT. THE STORY WAS GREAT, ORIGINAL AND NO WONDER IT'S THE HIGHEST GROSSING FILM IN JAPAN. FOR AN ANIME, THIS IS ACTUALLY CHEAP!"
5,BRILLIANT!,"After watching this movie I can see why the disney animators worship the director. People you respect for their animation abilities (creator of Pixar for example) believe this director to be one of the greatest animators of all times. Once you see this movie you will understand why. No computers here. Painstakingly done by hand, this is a magnificant piece of work. Younger kids may not truely understand the scope but adults will marvel at the creativity and the workmanship. You know the story, you know about the awards, now watch the movie."
5,Greaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!,This was a beautiful movie all around and mind-boggling astounding from every imaginable aspect!
5,Ooops..,"Hayao Miyazaki did it again. It is a fantastic animation movies. It has a great quality pictures, nice plot, and wonderful story."
5,BUY It (the DVD),"This movie is the best one I have ever seen, you should get the DVD. It is not that much more expensive but the japanese dialouge is better than enlish. This movie may look a little odd but it is a mix of adventure and mystery. At first you may be a little confused but if you watch the whole thing, every single detail will be explained. This is a movie for the whole family. My brothers hate cartoons yet they loved this movie. You have too watch this movie from beginning to end, if you don't, not only will you be confused but you will blow the fantastic ending. I never cry during movies but my eyes welled up at the end of this movie. Two thumbs up to Hayao Miyazaki!"
5,Took My Breath Away...,"This has become my favorite movie. I rented Sprited Away on thursday evening, watched it, with great amazement at today's advanced animation technology. I couldn't get it out of my head all week, untill I finally bought it.The animation is superb, the characters really grow on you ( Chihiro is adorable, as she grws greatly as a person, alongside with a bunch of whacky characters that make you laugh and cry at the same time)I loved the lenght of this movie, so anyone who thinks that 125 minutes of pure bliss is intimidating, really shouldnt think that.This is a true work of art, worthy it's oscar time a hundread and I cannot stop watching it. Great stuff."
5,An anime movie unlike any other,"When I first found out about Spirited Away, I didn't think that it would be good, but I was completly wrong. This movie has everything any fan of Miyazaki's previous masterpieces would cherish. Despite the PG rating, this movie was beyond my expectations, and I'm 15, my mother even thought it was great. I thought Hayao Miyazaki's previous films like Princess Mononoke and Castle of Cagliostro were nothing compared to Spirited Away, and they were pretty great."
5,Unreal!!!,"This is a strange and beautiful film about a girl called Chihiro who gets lost in a strange world. Her parents are turned into pigs and she has to work in a Bathhouse owned by Yubaba [oh ma God, she's ugly!!!!!!] She also meets a mysterious boy called Haku who is also an amazing and beautiful whispy white dragon. Haku and Chihiro slowly fall into a tender and sweet love but in the end she had to leave the strange world to save her parents. A hilarious, frightning heart-warming love story about a girl who will do anything to save her parents. Like me, all those who love animated films with mystical creatures and far-out places, watch this incredible, breathtaking film. Like my title, this movie is literally UNREAL!!!!"
4,"Beautiful and fantastic movie, but the best?","This is a beautiful and fantastic movie and well represents Japanese spiritual world such as the concept of Yaoyorozu-no-kami (eight million kami). But, actually, I am not sure why this is the most popular Ghibli movie in America. I think even for Japanese it is difficult to understand some of scenes. Miyazaki used a lot of abstract and symbolic elements and they made this movie more complicated than his other movies such as My Neighbor Totoro, Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, and Princess Mononoke.But I would say this is still a very interesting movie and some scenes have left a strong impression on my mind. I like the scene where Chihiro eats rice balls with weeping tears."
4,Spirited Away,"My eleven year old daughter loves this video, but she was really upset that it took so long to get here--I can't believe you guys can't do better than eight days from Springfield, Mass. to Jaffrey, NH. I can drive it in about two hours. As a matter of fact, after a week, I mentioned that to my daugher, and she asked if we could ""please drive down and pick it up"" ourselves.My previous experience with Amazon has always been extremely positive. Too bad this one kinda sticks out."
1,Why was this shipped to me in U.S. if I can't play it in this region?,"Appearantly movies have different regions they can be played in. In order to play this movie I have to have the type of player it requires. To come to find out this type of player is illegal to buy in this region! How can someone not of informed me of this when placing the order? As for the movie, seen it before and absolutely love it!"
3,Alice in Wonderland?,"Having seen the preious moives from Hayao Miyazaki, I think I know pretty much what will be happening in this movie. Some sort of man vs. nature kinda thing. To be suprise, this is not the case but rather it is kinda like Alice in Wonderland -- having the big headed motel owner being the queen, and the workers being the solders. I think this movie is just another version of Kiki's Delivery Service with the same theme. One goes in a strange place. One meets some friends. One gets into trouble. One gets excitement. One fights for something. One wins. One gets out the strange place and happy ever. This is not a boring movie but I constantly try to match the plot (if there is any) to the current event around my own life (my own strange place if I may say). This may be a better movie if it is released in the 80's. However, nowaday, we are mostly worrying about war and stuffs like this, this movie just doesn't suit."
2,Bad argument and bad ending,I saw this DVD at a friends house I had a lot of expectactions about it since it was a Disney merchandised product... well I began to see it and my girlfriend wanted to vomit after the first ten minutes from seen such grotesque creatures in that movie . The ending was quite bad also since people are turned back to normal but that world stays as evil as in the beginning...well so if you want really good manga better gowith the Macross Series...
3,Cute,"Spirited away is a very cute fanatical film. I did not like tho how spoiled Chihiro is in the beginning, but i guess that is what this movie is kinda based around...changing her from a weak crybaby into a stronger more independant one...which does happen...the beginning just annoys me. I also did not like how slow the beginning is....i remember how i was sitting there watching it and going...""would you please hurry it up?!?"" All this movie had going for it really is it's comedy...when it's funny...it's funny...end of story. I believ this film to be more suited to children around the age of 12 and under i suppose. It is very cute, but i dont think people who are older and a bit more suphisticated will like it too much....the story is just plain weird. So..it will make a nice gift for your kids..but not for yourself."
3,This movie is WAY overrated,"It's not a horrible movie, but certainly nothing extraordinary. I found the story to be minimal, with a lot of wasted time between the very beginning and the very end, which was entirely predictable.Clearly, Hayao Miyazaki is one of those opium writers, like the Alice in Wonderland guy. The whole movie is basically a shroom trip, just like Princess Mononoke. Lots of cool visuals.The best part is the beginning, where Dad is driving the family around in his Audi S4, aggressively tackling the dirt road and boasting of his Quattro IV all wheel drive system. :-)"
5,Ghibi studios has outdone themselves.,"Spirited Away is a beautifully drawn, anitimated, and plot out story about a young girl, Chihiro, who at the beginning is a tad bit whiny and spoiled. But as the movie progresses you see Chihiro, now named Sen, become more mature. It's a wonderful movie about, I believe, responsibility and love. I think Disney did a fine job dubbing it, as they have with the other movies by this same person. Grant you, I was disappointed in the ending, but if any of you remember Princess Mononoke it too had an ending like this. It leaves viewers to come up with their own idea as to what happened after the movie ended."
4,Spirited Away,"I am not big on many of the Animation movies with their spin on what I consider overacting heroes, however from time to time I find those films that rise above any cultural difference and truly inspire and illuminate something special (e.g. Akira, Ghost in the Shell, and Princess Moanoke). This movie along with being nicely animated had an interesting way of telling the story. A family goes on a picnic and enters a strange world through a path into a walking tunnel. The lessons the young girl learns reminded me of another great story (Wizard of Oz). I don't mean it reminded me of it because they are alike, but because they have great and unusual settings and characters showing you very different perspectives. I think most the family will find this animated story entertaining and educational. Great quality DVD with plenty of replayability. If you enjoyed this catchKiki's Delivery Service.CA Luster"
1,This is NOT AS GREAT as everyone says!,"This movie is (apart from some good animation) rotten, very creepy, and will mess with your mind, like it has with mine and a person that also has seen it with me. I strongly suggest that if you like horror storys you might just stomach this otherwise stay away from it! It was made for Japan and thats where it should have stayed!(If you love animation so much that you have to see this film then watch it with the lights on or curtains open and take a break from waching this film for 5 miniutes every 15 minutes and sit outside if you can, if the film is to much for you from a certain point then dont watch any more because the film becomes worse and worse.)"
1,Is this a joke???,"This film was, without a doubt, the worst film I have ever seen. For one, the animation is crappy -- what happened to the inbetweeners? For two,the film goes on and on and on and makes no sense throughout! For three, the girl is just stupid. Half of her lines in the film are to scream and run forward. Then don't get me started on the mud bath sequence! What was the point of this film anyways!"
5,BEST MOVIE EVER!,"This is my very favorite movie that I believe to be peerless in animation techniques, unparalleled in creativity, and a truly immaculate movie overall!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,a bit overrated,"I was expecting more from this film considering it is the most successful film in Japan's history ever. It is long and slow in parts (many parts). The animation is great with many magical moments, but don't expect cool Matrixesque parts. I was hoping that characters would have more special powers etc. Overall the movie is great but don't believe the hype, watch for yourself. As far as people claiming that Disney has changed the film, this is totally untrue. Obliviously the translation from Japanese to English is not exact, but even with this great pains were taken to be as close as possible. Scene to scene, everything is the same. I definintely recommend watching this film possibly with some uhh emm mood enhancement. You know what I mean."
2,"Great Movie, Bad DVD...","I've watched the movie in Asia over 2 years ago when it first came out. It is the most wonderful Japanese anime I've ever seen. I had waited two years for the zone-1 version to come out.And I'm totally disappointed by the picture quality of this DVD! It's blurry and desaturated. It's lost all the sharpness and saturation of the original movie. Can't believe Disney did such a bad job on Telecine (the film transfer process) for this award-winning movie.But the problem is, for this DVD, disc 2 (the Original Japanese trailers) is better than disc 1. The first several trailers just look gorgeously crisp and clear with absolutely no blurs, and the color looks vibrant and vivid..So, I think Disney should consider re-mastering this movie or offering a refund program. Watching this DVD, my wife says, is like watching a VCR. Great Movie, bad DVD...what a waste..."
5,AMAZING!!!!!,"this is a must have! i first saw it at camp. i didnt want it to end! this movie is sweet,funny,spellbinding, and just plain fun! me and my imaginary freind have seen it 6 times! a must buy!"
5,Outstanding!,"There is no way to get more perfect than this animation is, period. Animation is astonishing and the story is superb. I'm sorry for those who are satisfied with the ""daa-daa"" from Disney, I like it too, but this is one trend that should be followed. It's not to scary, it's less violent that ""Lilo & Stitch"". There is some blood, but everybody bleed when they get hurt, it's natural, people should get used to it, not scared of. And what a fantasy! I never seen anything so good since... EVER! It's true that US dubbing is the worst in the World. But with this DVD I'll be able to watch it in raw japanese with english subtitles! I can't wait to get it! You shouldn't too!!!This movie is suitable for all ages, it's just beautiful. Don't take any annoying paranoic parent advice. Be free and let your children watch this awesome film knowing that the values transmitted by it are just the best."
5,Outstanding,"In one of the most engrossing cartoons of my lifetime, I was just wanting more. After seeing the film I wondered why it was such a limited release in theatres. Many of my friends who wanted to take their children could not as it was too far to see it. My children all loved the film and cannot wait till it comes to DVD."
4,Caution to those who watch,"Friends - I agree this is one of the most captivating and wildly imaginitive movies ever, but we bought it based on how much my daughter loved Kiki's Delivery Service (she's 7). Beware - my child was scared to death. This is very powerful stuff. The creators of this movie must have done some real trippy drugs or something. There's an almost oppressive feel to the movie - this kid sees her parents turned to pigs and has to battle her way through some kind of bad LSD trip to rescue them. If your child is sensitive, and easily sucked into a world of imagination, this movie might blow thier minds. I'd give it a PG13 rating at least. If I'd watched it by myself I would have given it 5 stars because it is so wildly, vividly freaky. Think we'll be sticking to Barney for a while."
3,Lost in the translation,"One of the most original and beautiful films to come out of Japan, Spirited Away suffers in English-speaking countries from the poor dubbing forced upon it by the Disney distributors. I could say so much about this film, but the other reviewers have said it all, apart from the fact that this film (like all films) is diminished in quality once an overdub track has been laid over the original language. The three stars is for the English over-dubbed version. I saw this film in the original Japanese and couldn't watch more than five minutes of the English dubbing without wanting to switch it off. (Obvious) American over-dubbing (which not only translates the language, but changes the content of what is spoken)is the reason so many foreign films fare poorly when released outside of their native lands. Ban all over-dubbing! [I remember somebody telling me that even the Australian Mad Max (released as The Road Warrior) was over-dubbed! What a joke]"
5,10 Stars!,"Brilliant? A masterpiece? Amazing? Those words don't do this movie justice. Not only is this the best anime ever made but also the best cartoon ever made and one of the best films period. When I heard about how wonderful this movie was I was skeptical because I've seen some jaw dropping animes before such as ""Akira"", ""Metropolis"", ""Grave of the Firefiles"" and ""Perfect Blue"" but when I saw ""Spirited Away"" it was like I was seeing for the first time in my life. No matter what you hear about this movie nothing can prepare you for what you're about to see. It's like Miyazaki's head opened up and all of his imagination just spilled on to film. This is the ""Wizard of Oz"" of animation. The best word to describe this movie is ""Wow!"""
4,Great Movie(:,Ijust watched this movie a couple of days ago with my family and it blowed me away. The movie was great and extremily creative.
4,Annoying gift,Searched a million stores for this. A present for my sister. Thirty bucks everywhere. Very happy to find it half that an she was extremely happy.
5,A film for people of all ages!,"I am in my thirties. I love this film and I asked my dad to watch it with me. He was very reluctant at first because he disliked anime. I asked him to watch just 15 miutes of it and he could quit after that. He became so enthralled by this film that he watched the whole movie twice in succession (once in England and once in Japanese with the English subtitle) !Nearly every scene of the film is a beautiful painting. It is all hand-painted with great care, unlike the usual American anime that is computer generated. The painting in this film is typical of the oriental style -- the paintings try to capture the essence rather than the exact likeness.I feel this is the greatest film that I have seen in recent years. It teaches very valuable life lessons without preaching. Though Chihiro is not very outwardly beautiful, the inner strength of her heart makes her truly shine. I was deeply moved by this story."
5,A Triumph of Film-Making...,"Spirited Away is one of those movies that stays with you long after you have watched it. It is a moving story of a young girl's dedication, loyalty and bravery. The film is beautifully animated. Hayao Miyazaki deserves to be recognized for this masterpiece."
5,Very good,"Did not know that this was a special edition, so was happily surprised. Had original case and cover with no scratches on the disc. Looked brand new though said it was used. Very happy."
5,"best miyazaki, best animated movie... best.","this blows all miyazaki's previous movies out of the water. i saw ""castle in the sky"" after seeing this one -- no comparison at all. the sheer inventiveness is enough to blow you away. and for once, the ""making of"" featurette is actually entertaining and enlightening. i loved the scenes of miyazaki making ramen noodles. and for gods sake skip the disney introduction and watch it in japanese. much love to miyazaki and studio ghibli. beauty."
2,The King Is Naked!,"What am I missing? I like Miyazaki's movies. But this one does not make any sense. It is all about the STORY, there is none here. Instead, it is suggestive. You could cut out any half-hour of the movie without altering it. Great art, no story"
2,I don't understand,"I watched ""Spirited Away"", after reading so many reviews about how it was the greatest thing ever created. I saw so much creativity involved in the process, but the plot holes were so deep I couldn't pull myself into the movie. I'm glad so many people find this movie wonderful, and hopefully I will watch it again someday and see that I am wrong. But I doubt it."
5,The most amazing Anime I have seen yet!,"I am not a big fan of anime. In fact when my husband said he wanted to see this movie I tried to get out of it. I'm sure glad he made me go. While the movie doesn't have the special effects or computer graphics like the newer disney movies out today, it's by far superior in story line and characters. It will make you laugh out loud, as well as make you think about the damage we are doing to our planet. It's a beautifully written story about a young girls quest to save her parents, and learn a few things about herself. I would recommend this to anyone, although it does have a few scary moments I think most children see far worse in any of the newer disney movies. I don't quite understand what a few people thought was so awful about this movie and kids seeing it. I think as long as you explain and understand yourself the meaning of what happens it's a wonderful story that teaches a very valuble lesson about morals. Wonderful! I can't wait to own it on dvd."
2,"We came, we saw, anybody want it next?","I had not heard about ""Spirited Away"" until it won awards. When a relative happened apon a pre-release video copy, he passed it along to us because we are huge Disney fans. My husband, 2 daughters and I love Disney animated movies. My older daughter, who is 6, had to run and hide 1/4 of the way into ""Spirited Away"". She has never done that from an animated movie before. Watching the parents turn into pigs was too much for her!The animation is beautiful but the story line is disjointed and many parts are not explained. It is as trippy as the Teletubbies. I'm glad I saw it once, but it certainly won't be watched until the tape wears out like ""Toy Story""!"
1,Did I miss something?,"My friend and I just watched Spirted Away last night, and I have to say, I don't see what all the fuss is about. The artwork is beautiful, but the story was frustrating and non-sensical. We are both fans of artsy films, but we continuously found ourselves laughing at this movie, and not in an intentionally funny way. Our most common comments were, ""This makes no sense,"" ""This must be for people who like to ACT like they are intellectual,"" or, ""Oh my god this is hoakey."" I cannot think of a better example of something being over-hyped. We also found ourselves wondering if Japanese people have a lot of self hatred, seeing that none of the characters in the film (or japanimation in general) looked even remotely Asian."
1,Lost in translation,"I rented this film and forced my best friend to watch this with me after hearing all this fan faving on the film. I'm open to new experiences. In return, I got nothing. This is the work of genius? This is nothing but a strange and weird animation. First clue to the reviewer that giving tips on how to watch this movie: a movie shouldn't need cliff notes. Nothing, and I do mean nothing in this film makes one ioda of sense to me and I can't believe I'm wasting more time in posting a review this garbage."
5,Odd. . . the Grudge meets Disney movie. . . BUT IT WORKS!!!,"Anime gets the common flag of boring, bad, and low-class by most. I will admit that I was one of those people, only liking the American hand-drawn stuff. But one day this movie was on Cartoon Network, so I said what--the--heck and watched it. It took me by suprise, no, took my breath away. The background scenery, the majestic frog monster things, the creepy No-face. . . wow. Some parts were a little bit overly rediculous, which I highly expected. I saw The Grudge at a birthday party, and laughed my heart out. This movie reminded me of The Grudge on many occasions. Not in the way of overly cheesiness, though. In the way of confusion. Great."
5,A must see!,"I had my doubts before my brother bought this movie and then shot it into the DVD player, but after seeing it, I was speechless. The movie itself is just amazing in the fact that no one has done it before. The tale is also inchanting, as it moves from one part to another. Anyone can watch this and be amazed with the visuals, the music, and the plot. Pick it up and see if you enjoy it, I recommend it!The only downside I could find is if you totally hate anime, then this is not for you."
5,Miyazaki's Masterpiece,"Spirited Away is an AMAZING movie, straight from a brilliant imagination. The art is beautiful, the story is captivating, and the characters feel like they are a part of you. Appropriate for any and all ages, kids to adults. If you haven't seen this movie, save yourself the rental fee and just buy it; if you have seen it, then you were probably going to buy it regardless of my review, so either way, BUY IT!!!"
5,"This anime is not only for animation's fans, but for everybody.","This anime is not only for animation's fans, but for everybody. you can sit and watch it with your family. Very nice story and fantastic senarios. Don't miss it."
5,Pure Beauty!,One of the most creative and enjoyable films I've seen in a while. The animation is fantastic with precise detailing. As soon I finished watching this movie I added more of Hayao Miyazaki's films to my queue. I watched it again with the English audio and must say that I prefer the Japanese audio with English subtitles.
5,Spirited Away,Everything went very well.Transaction excellent. Received right on time. Communication excellent.The video was in perfect condtion and the jacket was new as well. I saved on this item and am very pleased to have done the transaction with this company.
5,Great Movie,"This has got to be one of my favorite movies of all time. Highly creative story line sweeps you up and carries you in like you can't imagine. It is hard to imagine such a thing for a world that is so bizarre from ours, yet it is masterfully done. The movie does not feel ""rushed"" like a lot of movies these days, but at the same time never drags. Attention to detail is very evident throughout the whole movie.I would simply caution that for young kids there are some disturbing scenes. When they are a little older, however, they will thank you for owning it."
5,Spirited Away Is a Window on Another Tradition,"This movie is so beautiful--full of dreamlike mysteries.I'd like to point out, however, that many of the mysterious elements are only mysterious to non-Japanese. Like our movies, this one is full of allusions to religious and folkloric traditions that a native takes for granted. For me, the wonder is heightened by my mental comparisons--what is common to both traditions and what is new and mysterious to me? What are the elements that I need to explore further? This film made me wish I had more time to do some research or maybe even visit Japan . . ."
2,"Bad product, but good service!","I bought a copy of Spirited Away that was ""Like New"". Once I received the DVD and went to watch it, it skipped terribly and then just stopped playing. Thankfully though, it was easy to return and get the money back! The service was great."
5,Anime at its best!,"I have never been a big fan of current anime (when i was a kid, i was big on transformers, gi joe and robotech) but when someone recommended this film, i had to see for myself. The file is incredible! I defintely recommend it to anyone who wants to see a great, engaging film!"
1,Kept waiting for the good part. Then the credits rolled.,"The only cool part in this three-hour eye-glazing inscrutable meandering unengaging overwrought plotless wad of celluloid is when the parents turn their heads to that whiny dejected bland one-dimensional bipolar waif what's-her-name after they've been eating at the table. What's three seconds divided by three hours? Answer: the movie was .000277 fun. That iota of satisfaction was dimmed by the resentment one of spending $25 on it, and two of all the glowing reviewers who are obviously unfamiliar with all the cool Anime that Japan has exported here for twenty-odd years. The act of composing my review is dredging up unwelcome images so absurd and stilted that they're laughable amidst the Homeric tragedy that they may remain lodged in my subconscious in remission for some time, perhaps forever."
1,b-o-r-i-n-g,"How can so many people love this movie? It's not bad, but it just not that great. Lots of friends like this film because it's from Japan and there're some ghoust and stuff. The art did nice job but the story is way too weak.This guy's early film are better, this one is pretty boring."
1,MAD EVER SO MAD,I BOUGHT THIS AND I WAS SOOO HAPPY TO SEE IT IN HERE. I HAVE BEEN WAIING FOEVER FOR IT AND WHEN IT DOSE SHOW UP IT IS NOT EVEN SPIRETD AWAY!!!! IT IS SOME WEIRD CD AND I WOULD LIKE TO SAY HOW DISPLEASED I AM. I WILL SEND THIS BACK AND I STILL WANT MY MOVIE PLASE EMAIL MEmiad98@hotmail.comPLZ IF U CAN >.<FROM VERY ANNOYED GIRL
1,Did you people see the same movie that I did?,"Boy, I am a bit shocked by all the great reviews for this film. I had read great things about this film before I got it last weekend. My kids liked Kiki. In short, this film was horrible, dreadful, and bizarre. Hard to follow. Scary for kids (6 and 8 year old) and adults (me). My kids have seen PG films before with scary scenes (Harry Potter, etc.), but this was a bizarre sort of scary. Sure, the storyline is a nice tale, which gives it a one star in my book, but perhaps this was one where the film should have been ""Disney-ized"" before pushing it as a family film. It makes me want to avoid Japanese anime even more!"
4,"Beautiful, Child-like Redemption Tale","While lacking the sheer epic sweep and grandeur of Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away carves itself a more personal, contained, lushness. An apathetic, depressed 10 year girl must save her parents when they all unknowingly stumble into a gateway to the Japanese spirit world. Working her [their] debt off in a spirit bath house she enlists the aid of a disparate group of denizens of this strange world. Like an erstwhile Pollyanna she makes friends and endears herself while learning to care about more than herself and even to love at her young age. Beautifully animated and vibrant, its appeal stretches across a wide age range as it went on to set box office records in Japan and abroad. Highly recommended."
5,The Wizerd Of OZ of Our Time....,"Ten year old Chihiro is moving from her home to Japan with her mother and father. When Chihiro's dad takes a short cut strange things began to happen.Chiiro meats a strange young boy named Haku.Haku is a spirit like all the other people and creatures that Chihiro meats in this film.Chihiro had to get a job or else she wouldn't survie.She soon lived among Linn in the Spirit World.Humans are not allowed to live in the Spirit World and thus Chihiro is in great danger when others around her start to suspect things are different about her.After Chihiro learned that Haku stole a magical seal.Chihiro vows to give it back to the owner, but out of love for Haku.With her friend No-Face and some other cute little tag-a-longs.Chihiro goes to see Granny in hope that she can forgive Haku for stealing her magic seal.A truly beautiful story and is great for all ages. Any one who is still a child at heart will love this"
5,Always been a fan,"I love all the Ghibli movies because they have a fun, simple story that you can just sit down and enjoy, while at the same time giving you that deep sense that there's a lot more to this movie than you realize. Kinda leaves you happy and satisfied while at the same time scratching your head. Miyazaki Hayao is a genius."
4,Amazing film... flawed DVD.,"I can't say anything about Spirited Away that hasn't already been said. I saw the film three times in the theater and absolutely adored it, and I purchased the DVD as soon as it was available Stateside.However, I was deeply disappointed by the English subtitles. Rather than subtitling the original subtle Japanese dialog, the English dubbed dialog is subtitled. This creates a strange disconnect when viewing the film with Japanese voices and English subtitles, because subtitles appear when nothing is being said. Worse, the English dialog apparently gives away certain details that are left ambiguous or delayed in the Japanese version (such as Haku's true nature).I am currently searching for an alternate version of the film on DVD which is not similarly flawed, but I found this peculiarity disappointing and would not have bought the DVD if I had known about it in advance."
5,More useless ravings from some girl named Faerie-Kat.,"Ooooohhhh YAYYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAY! I love this movie it is my favorite. Its just perfect. THat is the only word I can think of to describe it. Perfect. It kept me watching the whole way though. I watched it when I was sleeping over with my Cousin,Nephi. Even he said it was the seond best movie he's ever seen(Comapred to stinky Yu-Gi-Oh who stole pokemon's rightfull place as ""The thing"". Can you beleive that!). Seriously, when it was over, All we could do was just gaped at the TV. I heard when they watched it at the theater, the audience actually stood up and applauded(I also heard everybody left the theater complaining. Sheesh,the lies some people tell) And it was SASADSADSADSADSADSADSADSADSADSADSADSADSAD all the way through. Seriously,it almost made me cry.It is really good. Now I have to go swimming in my plushie collection that sadly doesn't include a Haku plush*WHAAAAAAHHHHHHH*"
2,this is not younger child's movie,"Sorry, but I have to agree with the other ""disturbed"" viewer. The images in this movie are very dark, disturbing and scary, even gory. I would not recommend this movie for most children under the age of at least 8. Sensitive children should NOT view this movie. Although I enjoyed parts of the movie, overall it seemed to me like a very bad dream."
5,Magical Must-See!,"This film has everything. It is a beautiful story in the grand tradition of fairy tales and other classic myths, and has the added bonus of being visually stunning as well. I would strongly recommend this movie to anyone with a dreaming heart and an appreciation for magic in everything."
4,FOR PARENTS: Beautiful but not for small children,"This movie is beautiful and I agree with many of the reviews. But those that say it is for young children probably do not have children. I watched this with my five year old daughter (the first hour) and she got very quiet and left the room. She ended up being very scared and upset in a very real way. She even had nightmares. It was my mistake. I should have watched it first to see. I am not saying that ALL children would be. But I would definitly say it is for more sophisticated children/older. And yes-classic disney was a bit more scary. But the scene where snow white gets lost in the forest is not quite the same as the feeling and imagery of the this film which does not let up as does Snow White when she says ""I was being silly to be scared"" then starts singing. Just watch it first and see what you think before showing small children."
4,Cute movie!,"This movie is another one of Miyazaki's work that's entertaining and very interesting, to say the least. You can't possibly expect what's going to happen next and even the ending is a little different than you would think. It's semi-scary for small children who might fear odd looking spirits/ghosts or find the idea of their parents turning into pigs with a possibility of being eaten somewhat disconcerting. The story follows Chihiro who learns to deal with her issues, shows that a lack of material greed can be quite beneficial, and who quickly builds the courage to save her parents. This movie has the sweet flavor of a plot with good purpose."
4,Apple is flawless,"The movie's Chinese title is ""Apple"" after the main character. I love gossip and I love seeing real Chinese people in movies so this movie set in the working Chinese world of Beijing was a special treat. I liked the additional message of the film that the wealthier Hongkong expats are really clinging to the vitality of the Mainland Chinese - they even look sickly despite their economic advantage. The Hongkong wife is a well known supporting character actress who starred in one of the most unforgettable HK slasher movies, 1982's ""He Lives By Night"" starring Sylvia Chang. White fishnet stockings are extremely comfortable, by the way."
1,Get me out of here!!!,"Firstly, I hate golf and find it utterly boring. Boring is also a word that can be applied to Kevin Costner who, as far as I am concerned, hasn't done ANYTHING of value since ""Dances with wolfes"". Rene Russo is a good actress, stuck here with absolutely nothing to do. And if this is a romantic comedy, where is the comedy? Please, don't expose me to this movie again!!!!"
2,average for a Costner sports film,I respect Kevin Costner alot as a Actor.his sports movies usually hit big time but this film is Long-Winded.after having his films not do so well at the box office it seems to me it's taken it's toll on him in this film.he is trying to hard to be perfect.not one of his best but better than some of his other choices in recent years.
1,Shooting Blanks,"This movie promised to be ""one of the best comedies of the nineties""...is that the 1890's? There was not one funny moment in this hastily put together inside look at golf, and the audience is supposed to fall in love with Costner's role long after he has put us to sleep. Sorry...just a ripoff of the much better golf classic ""Dead Solid Perfect"" with Randy Quaid, and a feeble attempt at humor which ended up in stupidity and boredom."
1,Blah!,"Boring, contrived movie. Always aware that this is a movie that has been heavily scripted. Nothing really seems natural or organic; the action, dialogue, situations, etc., all seem quite contrived and scripted...and mostly in an unoriginal and bland manner. These people who rave high praise about this movie must be easily entertained. If you must watch this, do so while doing something else you need to do at the same time so you at least won't feel cheated out of your time."
1,Tin Cup,The DVD was completely unusable. All the people looked like smurfs...totally blue and it has a wide black line down the middle with the left and right side of the video being reversed. Could not use...ABSOLUTELY!!
2,Nothing Special,"Golf is a slow moving sport and Tin Cup was one slow moving movie. Somehow Kevin Costner's character(Roy McAoy) just seemed to annoy me. The club breaking scene was oh so troublesome. And why in the world does Renee Russo's character fall for this guy? The ending was surely odd. I guess Costner's character was loaded with determination. A minor plus I guess.Another highlight was when Roy MacAvoy chipped a shot out of the bar accross a runaway and forced a Pelican to leave its perch. Cheap amusement but certainly amusing.However, this movie is a little too low energy for me. Seek out Bull Durham or Field of Dreams instead."
2,Not for real golfers,I bought this video for my husband - an avid golfer. This doesn't compare with the movies profiling the lives of Bobby Jones or Francis Ouimet.
2,for golf fans only,There's a nice soundtrack but otherwise not much to recommend. Costner is constantly obsessed with proving he can make the big shot. How can anyone sympathize or empathize with a compulsive jerk like this. If anything this movie must be about the pointlessness of golf itself.
5,Hard to find movie.,I wanted this movie for a while and couldn't find it at any store. Service and speed was great. Great help
4,Golf Pro/Love Amateur,"The subtitle of this movie says it all. Roy is adept and relaxed at golf, but love he's the opposite. The turnaround in both occur (well somewhat the love more than golf, for the risk taker in him persists) with a local psychologist taking lessons in golf, while she gives him lessons in love and mental skills.The acting by lead characters is good, esp. Cheech. There is too much f** words and other language in this for this reviewer, and I know before it's said it's only my opinion and it is.The soundtrack is superb, which I bought and play often since watching this on big screen first. Interesting plot and well done cinematography.Not my favorite golf flick, but not in bottom third either. Somewhere in middle."
4,Tin Cup,I never got to watch the dvd. When I received the dvd it was scratched and I was unable to watch the movie.
2,Not Worth The Time,Golf is an uplifting and inspiring sport. This movie was neither. Ending was not at all realistic. Only good part was cameo roles of well know golfers.
2,Romanticlly dull and boring,"Tin cup is one of those films that meanders ever so slowly, considering it's centerd around the game of golf, one may find it quite quicker and maybe far more enjoyable to watch an actual entire 18 hole game itself. Costner does he's standard by the book routine of romantic shmaltz (do I sense some Meg Ryan typecasting going on here) and Rene Russo does little else but try and swing a golf club in those tight golf pants. Billed as a romantic comedy one may find it difficult to find laughs amidst all the yawns! . For serious lovers of the game or Costner himself, others may find it far more entertaing finding a movie about love on the croquet set."
1,Not as good as I remember,"I watched this movie the other day with the thinking that it had been a decent movie. I was really wrong. I hated it. I am realizing that I have these romantic memories of movies from the 80s and 90s that cut out all the bad parts and stuff that I didn't like in the movies. This is one of those. The plot was weak and meandering. There's more I didn't like in the movie than parts that I did. For me, Kevin Costner's character was sleezy and not that likeable. Renee Russo's character wasn't that likeable either. I'd definitely recommend that you pass on this one and watch something else."
5,Wonderful movie.,"I really liked this movie and came away with a great feeling. Part of my excitement about this movie may come from the fact they filmed part of it in my neighborhood. For about a month we had movie crews and actors running around. It was kind of neat to see part of Hollywood in my neck of the woods. Plus a lot of my neighbors were extras in this movie. Kevin and Don's characters were also supposed to be from the University of Houston.That being said, I think Kevin did a wonderful acting job. His character was completely believable. It was also interesting to see Cheech and Don being on opposite sides after watching them together in their TV show, Nash Bridges. And of course, Rene looked great."
3,PRETTY GOOD,Kevin Costner is charming but a bit unconventional and temperamental in his role. He challenges a very cocky Don Johnson. A prim and proper Rene Russo is the object of both men's affection. Who knew a golf movie could be funny and entertaining? It really is.
3,Tin Cup,I wasn't to thrilled with this movie I'm a Christian and all the cussing and sexual inuendo ruined it for me.
4,American Cars Past to Present by DeLorenzo,This book contains numerous full-color pictures of Cadillacs andother fine cars. There is a rendition describing the evolution ofthe Ford Assembly Line. Compacts and subcompacts are depicted.The famous Tennessee 1-Elvis auto is shown in full color. The workis worth the price of admission for auto-enthusiasts. This bookwould make a good purchase for the student in your house. Therendition would make a perfect class project or conversationcuriosity for visitors. The volume is well-researched and topical.
2,Adjustable width but VERY thin plastic vinyl window shade,"I bought this item for my classroom since I couldn't find the correct width of a shade anywhere else. In the instructions to have the shade fit the window, the roller was adjustable and the shade was able to be torn to fit the roller. It attached then to the roller with double sided tape already on the roller. But the shade was so thin, that just attaching it to the roller, made it rip more. Room Darkening??? No, way.... It does say ""Economy"" on the package. Maybe there are different levels of room darkening. I don't feel for the price that I received an equal quality item."
1,Pure Rubbish,DO NOT EVEN CONSIDER BUYING THIS PRODUCT.The only thing magic about this product is making you money disappear with no return on your investment other than frustration and another item to take out to the curb.Adjusting the size on this product is fraught with many pitfalls which will destroy the product.
2,Useless With No Brackets,This item is useless as is due to the fact that it comes with no brackets for proper mounting. Nowhere does it state that you will need to go out and buy additional items for this item to work properly.
1,"Save your time & money, buy something else","I would have given it ZERO stars if that was an option. The only reason I am not returning them is because I need something on these windows until I find a better shade. They are thin, there is no ""darkening"" quality to them at all. They are flimsy and the plastic strip inside the pull down is all over the place. Just a 100% disaster! They are possibly the cheapest most awful shades I have ever seen."
5,Pure energy!,"Fast, loud... Descendents! Hear the same musics, but live! Better then the studios ones!"
4,...kinda like mashed potatoes between your toes...,"the first time i heard this album i was waiting for my mom while she was trying on clothes. since then i've been in therapy for almost 10 years. needless to say that my association between this band and mashed potatoes is nothing out of the ordinary, i just don't like the gravy."
5,Perfect!,"i knew i had to buy this because...well, it's Descendents! but seriously, this was worth every cent, and it arrived in perfect condition! you have no reason not to buy this!"
5,This book is a heart melter,"This book came to my attention not too long ago .The time was about when i was feeling a little lonely. The book focuses on how society is not really something that can be escaped but that has to be just left alone. The book helped greatly on saying that there is so much suffering here in society, and here is OSHO getting to the real root of the point.You DON'T NEED TO SUFFER ANYMORE! This book is something I highly recommend. Osho will humble you to points that you didn't know existed. And if your suffering about someone, although I am not a professional this book will be the sun that didn't rise up. Most of the people here got the point of the book right. I'll right a better review when I don't have as much homework."
5,One of the best--thank you Ben,"Wow. I had to write in after reading the critics' reviews above. I first heard this album in 1994, and have been in love ever since. Ben Harper is truly an incredible, soulful, spiritual songwriter and performer. This album is sweetly, deeply, and incredibly moving--he speaks the truth. And to call him an unexciting performer is a crime--just see him LIVE. I have been to few shows indeed with such energy and communion. Ben is timeless!"
4,Very Good 5/ out of 5 stars,Very Good and enjoyed listening to Welcome to the Cruel World by Ben Harper but unfortunate when I first rated it I accidently confused it with another CD by Ben Harper so I'd like to apologize to you readers and liked to change my rating to 5 / out of 5 stars for Welcome to the Cruel World .
5,I love his changing tempo and variety of songs!,"""Waiting on an Angel"", and ""Walk Away"" are two of my favorite songs. I think Ben Harper did an excellent job of creating emotion with his songs."
4,Another Ben Harper...,Couple of great tracks a couple hokey tracks. Great lyrics and nice melodic rhythms. Overall a good album to own.
4,Sign of Amazing Stuff to Develop,"Ben Harper is definetely the most underrated musician in the mainstream music scene. This album is proof of his deep background in blues, rock, and folk music. Songs like ""Like a King"" not only show his uncanny ability to match vocals to music beautifully, but is a sign of the soul that develops in his music. His heavenly voice is just starting to mature on this album, and only a few songs really show what he can do.Later albums, especially ""Burn to Shine"" really show the diversity of his musical talent, but this is a good show as well. Many songs mix his excellent slide work and folky-bluesy rhythms. But, like I said, it is only a sing of future greatness. If you want a great Ben Harper album that shares what he does best, Soul, but his two most recent albums. If you're already a fan, there is no reason to miss out on another prolific album."
3,ben harper,"well...hmm.. i only got this cd because of ""forever"" for my girlfriend. i myself am a ben harper fan. only a handful of good songs out of 14. but if you like ben harper than this cd should be in your collection"
3,MY BROTHER LOVES THIS GUY...,"See,I'm more of a hip hop cat.Don't get me wrong,I like rock and trip hop and the like but it's aquired taste music.Now my older brother,Malcolm on the other hand is a rocker type.One artist he LOVES is Ben Harper.I finally listened to one of his Ben Harper CDs and it was pretty cool,I must say.The title track is nice and so is ""Mama's Got A Girlfriend"".He's a very talented dude.So I guess old Malcolm has taste after all...(LOL)"
1,one time listen...,and i'll probably go and sell it for an unlucky bloke who'll pick it up from the used cd section. waste of my 13 bucks.
4,Strong and yet sweet...,"This one is an album I instantly loved. Harper's voice is amazingly expressive and the guitars are wonderfully played. I wonder what Mr Hires is talking about when he uses expressions such as ' hints of modest talent'(referred to H) and the 'narcotic effect'of this album. I mean, have we been listening to the same songs? I definitely appreciate the whole job Harper has done with WtTCW both from a musical and a lyrical standpoint and would like to point out that the strength of music is not necessarily to be found in hysterical screams and wild guitar playing. I never ever felt sleepy while listening to Harper. I feel alive and thankful and deeply moved, every single time."
5,WOW!,The album is wonderful. I love the lyrics and how they make me feel. Ben Harper just has a way of getting to you!
5,So You may shoot me with your words...I'll Rise...,"I don't know which CD I prefer most this one or ""Will To Live"". Keep your eye on this artist, he ain't no top 40 wanna be. He's truely on his own path. Just when you think you have him nailed down he shows you another insight to his talent.He ranges from bluesy acoustic, to riffs reminiscent of Hendrix on his cover of ""Voodoo Chile"" on the 30 min. live bonus CD. Here again, the quality of the recordings are apparent on high resolution systems. All the audiophile prerequisites are met. Buy this and enjoy...."
4,good hard science mystery,"the book is one part scifi and three part mystery/thriller. What happens is a scientist tries to bring himself back to life but it doesn't work, but a detective, who is kind of like Will Smith, thinks he DID sruvive and is planning to spread these little nanorobots all over Los Angeles and San Diego. The dialogue is excellent, maybe the best i've EVER read in a book. The characters are all pretty cliche, though. But what's best about it is that it remains ""scientificky"" without like th 100-page lectures that other hard science writers put in their novels. It skips all that boring stuff. The writing style is good, and fast-paced. Saltzman doesn't waste five pages describving a room, he gets on with the story very quickly, which kind of explains why ALOT of things happen in an nly 250-page novel or so. Anyway, I'd give it about 4 and a half stars, I wouldn't give it 5 because there is a HUUUUGGGEEEE twist at the end that I honestly don't like very much."
1,TOO pale,This bedding set wasn't as nice as I thought it would be. The colors were so pale. It looked like something that was washed in Clorox bleach several times. I brought it back to the Babies R Us store that I purchased it from and exchanged it for a nicer crib bedding set.
1,Devours batteries...,New batteries went dead only after 45 minutes of listening to a tape. I've heard others say the same thing about the newer walkman cassette players. My old one went forever on a set of batteries. This is going back!
2,A few problems,"I am an avid listener to radio, and I really need a cassette player, so this seemed to be an excellent combination. I like the digital tuning -- BUT -- this unit has a problem. The surface buttons for turning on AM and FM radio are easily bumped, and if yhou are carrying this around in your backpack, you better have the ""lock"" button on or you will certainly drain the battery. I have gone through about six sets of batteries simply because it gets switched on so easily. Another problem is that if you want to clip it to your belt, you need to put it in a holder because the unit itself does not include a belt clip. This means that you need to take it out of its holder to turn over the tape.Bottom line... a useful cassette player, but it has a few design flaws."
2,Sony Not My One and Only,"I am truly devoted to Sony and have never had a probelm in the past with anything i purchased from them...until now. The cassette no longer works, which is one of the main reasons I purchased it. The digital turner is also a little out of whack but the reception is execellent.I'm more than a little dissapointed overall and now will have to look into a more durable cassette"
4,Turning the final page,"I'll try not to give too much away with this review. This is the finale to a wonderful, if extremely dark at times, series. The cast has had a hard time fighting their nemesis, having lost a few of Tamahome's precious memories. The ""Universe of the Four Gods"" will finally be closed for good with hope finally reborn for Miaka and her friends. I saw this originally as a fansub and the professional version has not dimmed my feelings for the series (as can sometimes happen--Sailor Moon s and SS under Cloverway as an example.) The video and sound is quite good. I had no problems watching it, though it once again gets dark at the end. It is that darkness that forces me to make this rated at 4 stars, even though there is something like a happy ending for all involved in this final tale from an ancient Chinese book."
4,Not Bad,"Whereas I do miss some of sea battles and the way the aircraft attack, this is overall a good game. I did enjoy seeing the cutscenes and the briefings before ""missions"" as well as the trading aspect of the game. I do believe I enjoy the first EE game more but this has more of a traditional feel to it in the world of strategy games."
3,Average at best,"I bought this game being a fan of RTS games like AOE 1,2,3 Age of Mythology, the C&C series, Rise of Nations, and EE1. While the the options passing through epics are cool, as is alot of other things, the killer for me is two very basic things, the speed in which you can scroll across the map is atrociously slow, finding attacks at the ends of your territory is pretty much ""oh, hey, THERE's the attack on me"" and the other being if an enemy gets into your own city, you must hand pick out your troops to counter-attack because the drag and drop feature known in ALL RTS selects BOTH citizens and troops. That is just horrible. in a panic you may find yourself sending all your resource gathering villagers in the middle of a fight. complete PAIN. IF you're looking for a good amount of diversity, this may be your game. It's pace and excitement are lackluster."
4,couldve been great,i got this game after i had misplaced it for 2 years. I couldnt find it. its definetly a good game no doubt hwever its thriving there are very little people online but the storymode is great and can be played over and over. it couldve been a great game.
4,Still a great game.,"I loved the first Empire Earth. #2 is just as good, It has better graphics but you are limited on the number of buildings you can build."
3,Good But,"its good but, it doesnt live up to empire earth 1, but at least its much better than empire earth 3"
3,Not very durable,"This is cute, but very tiny! Its only 3 inches long on either side. Its pages are simple and short but still got my toddlers attention. I can't say its durable though, the corners fray quickly compared to other board books I have.The price is $3 at the time of this review, for what you get its not in my opinion worth it. I got a far more durable one for just a dollar more that is holding up way better then this one. My daughter is rough with her books so I always try to find something that lasts."
4,Great Movie,"This is a great Movie, Me and My family rented this Movie about 3 Months ago, and as soon as the Movie was over I new I was going to buy it. This Movie is so Funny even though some peaplemight not catch all the jokes right away I think its worth watching anyway. Go with Pistachio as he trys to rescue is Mom and Dad from the evil Master mind Devlin Bowman. after hereing all that I think you should at least give it a try.I give this Movie two thumbs up"
1,What ever happened to Chevy Chase?,"I'd rather eat liver than ever have to see the likes of this movie again. Remember when you'd sit there in the 70's wishing a really ""not funny"" SNL bit would end? Imagine knowing it won't end for at least another hour and there will not be a better skit next. Dana, you blew it. Even for kids this movie held no interest, mine (9, 12, and 14) left the room to play video games."
1,I wish I was a kid,"I figured that with Dana Carvey as the star, this movie would be somewhat amuzing. Man was I dead wrong. The jokes were not at all funny and the story line was very stupid. Save yourself the money and find another movie to rent/buy."
3,"My Word it was awful, but my kids just loved it.","This movie is living proof that everything isn't for everybody. I found this movie as bad a picture as I've ever seen. A waste of a lot of good people. If you are my age (39) and you want to find a movie STAY away from this one........unless you have kids. My youngest son begged to see the picture, my two boys 9-11 just LOVED it. The loved the gas attacks, they loved the stupid accents, (they didn't get the delta dental joke but that's life.)They would give it 5 stars, I would give it 1 So I gave the avg. It is a small price to pay for happy children."
4,"Hilarious, but no WIDESCREEN?","I really thought this was a funny, funny movie. Makes you feel like a silly kid all over again!Great extras and features and a well put together DVD. My only complaint....the lack of a Widescreen format. Shame on Columbia Tri Star for not maintaining the integrity of the movie the way the director indended it to be.If that doesn't bother you...get this movie if you want crazy laughs!"
1,I Still Have Trouble Believing...,"*Holy cow* This is the universe's worst movie. I still have trouble believing that someone spent time and money to make it. I have trouble explaining even to myself why I sat all the way through it; all I can come up with is temporary insanity, or paralysis, or both. It may be a kids' movie, but in this case that's no excuse. It is so stupid, mindless, and devoid of anything resembling actual humor (or anything else that's good in the world, for that matter), that even kids will lose IQ points as they watch it. And don't tell me there's nothing else for your kids to watch. Get ""The Rescuers,"" or ""Winnie-the-Pooh,"" for crying out loud! There is a lot of great entertainment for people of all ages out there, enough that no one should ever need to watch this film. It is not fit for human beings to view. The only creature I know of who could be entertained by this movie is my dog, who will eat anything."
3,"Goofy, predictable, and poorly acted...BUT, my kids love it! Go figure.","I thought this movie was so bad I threw our prior copy away. However, due to the regular requests and complaints from my tween and teen kids to watch it, I ordered another copy. Again, I tried watching it. On the second time through, I realized there are a few funny comments and lines, but I still would not recommend it for anyone over 18.With that said, my kids quote it regularly and find it to be hilarious.Somewhere between Napoleon Dynamite, Monty Python, and some of the SNL skits, there are a few quotable scenes and laughs. VERY sophomoric, but again, not for adults looking for redeemable entertainment."
1,Couldn't Even Finish,"I can easily say that this is the worst movie i have ever seen. I couldn't even finish it- it was so painful. How Dana Carvey could stoop so low is beyond me- maybe he owed someone a favor. The kids might like it, but it is not worth an ounce of mature adult time."
1,Absolutely Pathetic!,"I expected a much better performance from a great comedian like Dana Carvey. This movie is simply not funny and it has too much annoying repetition. I'm surprised that young kids even find this movie funny. People, save your money. This is such an insult to comedy."
4,Almost at the top of my movie meter.,"I watched this at a party with my friend. It was hysterical! We laughed more than a gazillion times. Dana Carvey was fit for the part of Pistachio Disguisey. And the crude humor was awesome man!But the only reason I am rating this movie four stars is because it needed some more pure action and adventure. If Revolution Studios is going to make a sequel (And I sure hope they do!) It has to has some more pure action and adventure! I know I'm dragging this down with all these complaints on one subject all a little too much. Bottom Line: It was a great movie! Keep the crude humor,keep Dana Carvey,keep the laughing out of your body disguises! Just put in some pure action and adventure PLEASE!"
1,The Master of Disguise experience...,"Can be easily captured without buying the DVD.Firstly, rip up $13.Then, beat yourself over the head with a hammer until your brains are coming out of your nose. Then, have Dana Carvey spit on you.Finally, shoot yourself in the stomach.This movie is not funny, entertaining. It does not even have a remotely interesting story. As some of the other reveiwers have said, this movie has the same terrible joke, repeated throughout the whole movie.Avoid this one like the plague."
2,Slow,"I went to see this movie because i think Dana Carvey is very funny, but this is definetly not his full potential. I've laughed many times at things that Carvey has done, but i didn't laugh one time at this movie. The plot was very dumb, and slow pased, and everything that happened was predictable. It got boring half-way through the movie, and they just repeat the same joke over and over. And lastly the movie was way too short, and when the credits started rolling, they should of stopped it there, and not put in all the stuff after it. I think they could of took a little more time making this movie before they realesed it."
2,The Master of Disgust,"I was thinking this movie was going to be silly and childish because of Dana Carvey's character he portrays in Waynes World and I was right. Look at Mike Myers in Waynes World and how he plays a goofy ""James Bond"" in Austin Powers. The movies preview did show some promise but the actual movie wasn't as great. I would of rather watch the preview 500 times than watch the movie."
4,The Good Outweighs The Bad,"Yes, there are some scenes that are just plain stupid, I can't deny it. But, there are others that more than make up for the bad. During the credits, you'll probably find yourself wearing a grin, and that's a good thing."
5,If only I could give it 6 stars!,"In this summer's most unexpected masterpiece, Dana Carvey delivers an Oscar-clinching performance as the ""master of disguise,"" portraying a myriad of captivating and unique characters. I cannot express how important it is that you see this movie. If you're only going to see one movie this summer, or even one movie in this lifetime, it MUST be ""Master of Disguise!"""
5,funniezt movie eva,"thiz right here iz prolly gonna b the funniest movie eva, ive seen the previewz and i die laughing everytime! so i can already tell that it iz gonna b an awzome movie,i give it 5 starz along wit 2 thumbz up"
1,bad but not in a good way,"Wow, I had already heard how terrible this film was before viewing it, but I had expected it too be so bad its good or something like that. Nothing could have prepared me for how terrible this movie is. Its a complete waste of time. Even Maria Canals looking incredibly hot sporting a huge prosthetic butt couldn't save it."
3,A Pleasant Surprise,"Ok, so this movie is stupid, but it never tries to pass itself off as anything other than stupid humor, that is why it works. There are enough laughs to please most people, but it certainly doesn't rate up with comedies such as Austin Powers, Hot Shots, Airplane, etc. I would have liked to see better character development, and the running length at 65 minutes is far too short. I recommend catching it during the day for half price."
1,"Whatever you do, do NOT watch this film...","It was really painful to sit through this film. We've all seen what Dana Carvey can do on Saturday Night Live. So why spend money watching him do it again in a movie? Also, to see Brent Spiner (""Data"" from Star Trek) be reduced to an evil, farting villain is sad. It really gives new meaning to the phrase ""captive audience"".This movie is so bad, it doesn't really merit a review. It also pains me to have to give it 1 star, rather than the 0 it deserves. Instead, I'm writing this as a public service to those of you who haven't seen it. Spare yourselves."
1,Very poor. Waste of time. Awful.,The main character is an idiot. The plot is cliche. The execution is flimsy. I had to struggle to maintain consciousness while watching. This film is quite a poor selection for children or adults. I cannot recommend it in any way. The most interesting thing is the title. Do not be misled. Stay away.
3,not so funny movie title,"there is a consensus that this is a movie for kids and not particularly funny at that, but I must confess, even as a reasonably mature male, Dany Carvey makes me laugh. His brand of deliberately silly antics can be enjoyed, or hated, here. More of a problem with this movie I think is its title. ""Master of Disguise"" seems to me to be a plagiarism of the title of the book with the same name by CIA agent Tony Mendez (publ. 1999). I doubt it is a coincidence; risking your life to save that of other Americans in the Middle East, as Mendez did (an incident now turned into the movie ""Argo"") is no laughing matter.The Master of Disguise: My Secret Life in the CIA"
5,Funny movie for the whole family,This is a little movie that is so funny. Dana Carvey is great in it. My kids loved this movie as kids and as teens and adults they still love it!
5,Funny and Silly,"I really enjoy this movie, its funny and silly. Dana Carvey's character is so sweet, and likeable its hard not enjoy him. The plot is a little thin, but for entertainment its very good. I enjoy watching it on those days when want to watch something funny, and not have to follow the plot too closely."
2,Great for 11 year olds,"Although I found this movie to be insufferable, my kids, ages 9 and 11 really enjoyed it. The plot was so tired it is hardly worth going into but, unlike the Austin Powers movies, it was appropriate for pre-teens. There was no swearing, but there were flatulance jokes; who could ask for anything more? (Alright, a decent plot would be nice.)"
2,You know it's a bad sign when...,"...even the other characters in a movie roll their eyes and look bored to tears at the hero's jokes.Dana Carvey plays a stereotyped parody of a guy from an Italian family famous for the art of disguise. His name is Pistachio Disguisi (get it - DISGUISE-i, get it????), which will give you an idea of the level of humor involved. Over the course of this endless movie, he becomes, among other things, a turtle, a cherry pie, and George W. Bush.My 8-year-old laughed; maybe your kids will too; thus the two-star rating (based on my opinion alone it would be a 1-star movie). But I would be surprised if anyone of voting age even cracked a smile."
2,without carvey this film would have had nuttin,"I can't imagine how such a bad idea got concepted and how DANA CARVEY got into it. There must have been a bet between Mike Myers and Mr. Carvey to see who could play the most characters in one film. While Mr. Myers was off making his Austin Powers trilogy Dana had somehow gotten a budget for his film. He probably raided his grandparent's retirement center. The script was written by Dana,his five year old son,Charles Dickens and Jabba the Hutt. A cast of misfits got involved(except for James Brolin who was drugged during auditions and Jennifer Esposito who thought it was Playboy the Movie). Then Dana broke into his sons piggy bank to get the makeup and costumes from the dollar store. That is how I believed the film was created(can you imagine how else it could have been?)."
1,A disaster I despise,[...]I have to agree with one of these other reviewers about the fact that this is an Austin Powers knock-off. All the disguising is stupid like when James Brolin is Jessica Simpson and Michael Johnson. Geeze! And Dana Carvey did a horrible Tony Montana impersonation. And the female lead wasn't that attractive. Horrible movie and the people who decided to make this are the ones who should get dummy slapped. I have nothing more to say!
1,Ed Wood would think this incoherent...,"Poor Dana Carvey, once he was funny, and maybe still is, but you'd never know it from this wreck of a movie. After the mildly interesting Pop-up book style credits, the movie has nothing going for it beyond Jennifer Esposito's comeliness. Otherwise, you get endless mugging, scenes paced for comedy if you find ""Teletubbies"" intentionally hilarious, and a painfully unfunny flatulence gag every time Brent Spiner's evil genius gives his evil laugh. Every time. It happens a lot. Brent Spiner looks embarassed every time, and I'm not sure it was acting. Supposedly this is for kids, but I can't see it working that way except as a bright, shiny, goo-goo-ga-ga time keeper for infants who have no awareness of the movie's context. In short, the cinematic equivalent of a mobile. Not recommended for anyone old enough to understand what a well-executed fart gag is."
1,"If you are under 10 years old, it's just OK.........","If you are over 10 years old and someone is paying you to see this movie, think hard before you go. With tremendous potential, they managed to eliminate all enjoyment a teenager/adult could get out of it, leaving the content suitable for only a 9 year-old or under whos parents allow them to joke about flatulence."
1,Criminally Bad,Perhaps the worst film I've ever seen. It says something sad about the film industry that this film was ever made. Couldn't they see in the initial concept reviews that there was nothing funny or entertaining here? Couldn't they tell in casting that no one was capable of carrying the roles they were assigned (least of all Cavey). Couldn't they see from the rushes that the film was actually painful to watch?
1,"Passing gas, and cow dung","Yes those 2 things in my title are used to get a cheap laugh. This movie is mainly about Dana Carvey doing silly impersinations . The only good thing about this movie is the fact that a beautiful lady is his co-star. But unfortunatley, neither she nor other actors add any humor to the story.If you're looking for a kids movie, spend your money on a disney cartoon instead."
1,master of the garbage dump,"this movie sucks! It's so stupid that I wanted to bust the disc. I could write every stupid thing, but it's to stupid for me to take the time to do so. This movie sucks. I now hate turtles."
2,"Master of improv, but over and over?","Now Dana Carvey is widely respected for his comedy, at least in certain circles. Yes, he is a funny man. However, his humor maybe limited to sketches, although many thought that Wayne's World was funny (no comment.)This movie was about a more or less dumb kid, Carvey's character, of an Italian family that have been Master of Disguise's for years. However, the dad of Carvey's character wanted to protect his son, so he protected his son from the family's dangerous legacy. Yet when his parents are kidnapped Carvey, his grandfather, and a recently hired assitee have to help Carvey become his destiny.Now what this movie does is let Dana Carvey do a lot of impersonations. What this movie does not do is develop a good enough plot to keep those impersonations in a good flow. A few lines are funny like ""turtle, turtle"" but overall the humor is just lacking or mindless or both.Carvey could have done a really good movie with all of his talents, but this is not it."
4,Stupid funny,"If you like stupid funny, this is the movie for you. We love it. I imagine people who like Nacho Libre, Napoleon Dynamite, Waking Ned Divine (not as stupid funny as the others), etc would like this one too."
4,Master of Disguise,We love this movie - it is a comedy for the whole family. It is one of those movies you can watch over and over and find something new/funny to laugh at. Definitely suggest this movie for anyone looking for a funny movie to enjoy with the whole family!
1,Worst Ever,"Absolutely the worst film ever made. What were they thinking? Not funny, not well acted, insanely cast, tedious, slow -- actually painful to watch. Avoid this film at all costs! This isn't even funny as a BAD movie. I can't even look at Carvy anymore after watching this!"
1,"Ugh, He Cheated Me","Complete waste of time. NOT FUNNY AT ALL! I had to force myself to watch the entire movie and hated it the whole time.I can't express how shocked I was at the quality of this. You expect SOME laughter, right? I spent the first half of the movie in utter dismay at how bad it was and the second half squirming in my seat for the ending. The level of humor may be on a child's level, but there are some things in the movie that are not intended for children.Life is short, don't waste your time!"
4,Alot funnier than I thought it would be!,"I completely agree with the reviewer who said that the professional critics missed the point about this movie. See this with your kids and watch how much they enjoy it! That said, the movie also has some hilarious bits that will fly right by children. The Al Pacino ""Scarface"" character is a scream and dead-on accurate. I went into this movie with low expectations and ended up laughing out loud through the whole thing. It isn't sophisticated, the ""Pistachio"" character is often a little too sappy, and some of the characters (Pistachio's mother) seemed miscast, but overall I enjoyed this movie and will surely watch it again (given how much my daughter loves it). Note to Dads: if the slapstick comedy doesn't keep you interested, Jennifer Esposito will. Major babeage! Give this movie a chance and you'll be pleasantly surprised."
2,what a bunch of dry jokes!,"I couldn't believe I paid money to see this tripe! Learn from my mistakes: save your time and money, and avoid this latest garbage from Hollywood.I reluctantly gave it two stars because of the few--and far between--truly funny sections in the movie."
1,Horrid,"I almost walked out on it. Good thing it was only 84 minutes. The rest of the audience seemed equally disappointed: everyone was quiet on the way out (certainly not introspectively quiet), and no one seemed happy. A waste of a perfectly good night in my opinion.The jokes were stale and redundant, and weren't funny even the first time they were delivered. I tell everyone that desperately wants to see it to wait until it comes out on video or DVD... don't waste your money at the theater."
1,Master of Disguisse,Master of Disguise- it was damaged-probably scratched. Very disappointed that I don't have a way to return it and get my money back-it was advertized to be in good condition
4,Great Dana and Great Fun,"My children (8 and 10) both enjoyed this film - and so did I. The great references to classic films has spawned a kind of mini film festival in our house. They now know about Jaws and other great films made before they were born.Dana Carvey has had trouble finding a good vehicle that lets him express his incredible comedic talent; maybe there will be better ones, but my kids and I enjoyed this one."
1,This movie is so bad... Don't waste money,"Oh boy this movie stinks so much. After two minutes you wish you could smack Dana Carvey so hard..... He is just so annyoing and THE DIALOGUES, they don't even make sense in anyway! You can only follow the plot (what plot?) by guessing what's happening. Turn your set mute it will save you a headache. The acting is way beyond worse and oh forget about it, I turned it off after 5 minutes because the movie was boring and annoying.... Watch it on tv."
4,Pistachios Never Tasted Better,"Dana Carvey's whimsical portrayal of the sweet, numbed-minded Pistachio Disguisey was, at best, amazing. His never-ending sense of satire and imitation was stretched to its limits, helping Carvey to pull off a beautiful portrayal of the idiot savants in the world. It is his first movie since 1994's ""Clean Slate"" and a bout with cancer, and he proved that he can still have fun that he loves to make others laugh."
3,Guilty Pleasure Silly-Fest,"I seem to be in the minority here because I like this flick.Wow, reviewers are skewering this movie as if they thought they were going to watch Citizen Kane and someone changed discs. This is not a good film, but it is a fun and wacky movie, a very silly vehicle for Dana Carvey that you have to be in the mood for. If you enjoy Pee-Wee's Big Adventure, Austin Powers, and Monty Python's films, then you might like this. It's pure nonsense, and doesn't claim to be anything more.With characters like the Turtle and Gammy Numnum, and things like the Sacred Pop-Up Book, how can you keep from smiling? And the impression of Robert Shaw from Jaws is dead-on.If you feel like something silly, this will satisfy you."
1,Possibly the worst movie of all time!,"Master of Disguise was the worst movie I have ever seen.First of all the jokes are poor.They use the same fart joke over and over,to try to get laughs.Dana Carvey was annoying as hell in this movie.I don't even think children would enjoy this movie very much.As short as the movie is,it's so boring that it seems twice as long as it really is.I will admit the scene where Dana Carvey is disguised as a pie is kind of cool,other than that it's no good.Let me just say the best parts were shown in the previews on television."
1,Terrible,Has-been-un-funny-never-really-was Dana Carvey in whats sure to be his last ever movie. Simply awful. Stuck toothpicks in my eyes it was so bad.
2,Potential Was There. . .,"Dana Carvey is a talented guy but this isn't the vehicle for those talents.I'm always wary of films with a multitude of producers (executive, co-producer, producer, etc) anyway, and this also has the Happy Madison inprint which makes it a double-stinkeroo.A couple funny parts, but on the whole, don't waste your time."
1,The worst I've seen--ever!,"This was absolutely atrocious. DC uses an annoying voice and nothing was even mildly funny except possibly a reference to an online auction service. ... One positive thing is that it isn't dirty, profane or overly violent, just mind-numbingly bad. ..."
3,"Good, but name is deceiving","This is a useful read, however, I was disappointed at the lack of technical depth. The name ""blah _technical_reference_"" implies technical depth, however, it was more generic and howto in coverage of nearly all topics. Other books, the Win2k Security Handbook by Schmidt comes to mind, actually have more satisfying technical depth if that's what you're looking for."
2,Generally Acceptable but NO SECURITY,"It seems this book was writed to help users understand the features that W2K has compared to his predecessor (NT 4). For the ISSO this book would not be of much help. If is Windows 2000 Security you are looking for, this book is NOT for you."
1,Only good for management. No content for those who work,"The Title is very misleading as previous reviews state. This book is a very high level presentation of Windows 2000 concepts and features. There is no real detail on anything and everything covered in this book is covered in any other book but in more detail. I would only recomend this book for management who are trying to ""get"" the Windows 2000 buzzwords right. This book is useless for real IT folks. I have been one for 14 years. Don't waste your money !"
3,Moderately Clever,"A moderately interesting modern version of Voltaire's Candide. Lukes' hero, Professor Caritat (a reference to the philosophe Condorcet) is a scholar specializing in the Enlightenment, and is taken through of a tour of several societies. Each of these societies exemplifies an idea about how to construct a society. Authoritarianism, Utilitarianism, Communitarianism, and Libertarianism are all featured. There is a dream sequence with a Marxian utopia. All of these societies are shown to be inhumane in different ways, primarily because of a single-minded focus on one idea for constructing a society. The book ends essentially with an endorsement of moral pluralism and Rawlsian liberalism. The quality of writing is average with a fair number of perhaps excessively cute intellectual jokes. Moderately entertaining."
1,The painfully hackneyed enlightenment of professor Caritat,"I've read some bad books, but wow, this is truly awful. Its only insightful moment, (which is also its only mildly comical moment) is when Caritat realizes that his experience in a Communist utopia had only been a dream. The rest of the book consists of maddeningly dumbed down caricatures of various political ideologies, written in the most ham-fisted, self-conscious, inconsistent prose I've ever had the misfortune of being required to read. A real letdown. A better use of your time might be to watch two orangutans pick chiggers out of each other's fur."
2,not too great,"while the book was interesting. i found it very hard to read, very slow. i was extremely bored with the book and found it very hard to read."
4,vintage paperback values,"The Paperback Price by Kevin Hancer is a superb reference as well as a fascinating look at the paperback format of publishing. The prices in it are somewhat dated; it remains very useful for judging relative value and identifying titles, authors and publishers. Further, just reading through the list of titles of one of the defunct, smaller publishing houses can be highly entertaining. All-in-all, the opportunity to pick up a copy of this book should not be passed over."
1,"Essays on Political Economy, F. Bastiat","Although the contents of this book are great in scope and influence and should be read by anyone interested in current affairs and economics, this is a rather poor edition of Bastiat's works. Pages in the table of contents don't correspond to actual pages in the book, paper is of poor quality, there is hardly any editing work, hardly any titles or subtitles, no effort in layout, no font variation from body to periphery of text... It is a very confusing edition and one that is hard to get through. My high school essays where better presented than these. At any rate, get Bastiat's works, but maybe avoid this specific edition."
3,"March 17, 2006 edition much better","The March 17, 2006 (green coverEssays on Political Economy) edition is much better because a click on the index will take you to each essay."
2,Publisher did a poor job on the Kindle version,"While it's never a bad thing to have some essays by Bastiat, especially ""The Law"" and ""What is Seen and What is Not Seen"" I was disappointed that the publisher didn't make it possible to jump from essay to essay in this version by using the 5 way controller."
2,Wacked out!,"The table of contents doesn't match up with where the chapters actually begin and there is no publisher information in the book. The texts were very informative, however the publisher's lack of organization makes this book very hard to navigate."
1,Dragonball GT: Vol #1 Affliction,"If Im wrong here then I apologize but I am very disappointed after I got my first US Dragonball GT dvd. I popped the dvd in my player and much to my suprise the series did not start off like the original Japanese version did.The Japanese version starts off with Goku and Ubb training and Pilaf wishes Goku to a child again. Well in the first dvd of the US release it starts off with Goku and Trunks captured by Rild and Pan is trying to rescue them. Well according to the Japanese release, the US release started off with Episode 17 not Episode1.If this is a mistake by Funimation then please fix the problem. If you intended this then I will not be purchasing the rest of the series as you have already ruined it. I am a Dragonball fan and this has really disappointed me, I can only hope this is a mistake. I really look forward to seeing the rest of the seies in the US release."
3,It was Alright...,"Well I bought this movie yesterday and i was a little bit dissapointed. The big dissapointment was how funimation skipped the first 15 episodes starting at a warped episode 16 which has flash backs of the first few episodes. The Japanese version starts in the middle of the show(Episode 17) acting like funimation never butchered the first 15. Oh well, the story is alright, the fight scenes are okay, and i kinda see why funimation took off the first 15 episodes(They wanted to get right into the good part of the baby saga and skip the 15 episodes of black star dragonball hunting. Even though they cut the 15 episodes i give it 3 stars."
5,This DBGT stuff tight,"I never saw it before, but I know who Baby is and I also know that Baby's home planet, Planet Plant was destroyed by the saiyans. Baby later on created Dr.Myu to resurrct him... Baby takes control f Goten, then Gohan, last Vegeta. When Goku got back from space all of Earth was his enemy thanks to Baby-Vegeta..."
1,DONT BUY,"Do not buy this unless you want a horrible memory of DBGT! Funimation did the worst job I have even seen bringing a Anime to America, First the cut out the 1st 15 episodes of DBGT, then they changed all of the music and the opening to some trash Rock/Rap. And the voice acting is horrible. 3 years ago I downloaded Super5's Sub DBGT's of the japanese series, and it was the best anime I had ever seen. It was the best Dragon Ball series. But when Funimation came out with this Id have to say its the worst Anime. The music on the origanals was so good, I just loved the opening theme with the animation. And now they have crap cuts from the show that make it look bad. If you want to watch DBGT how it was ment to be seen search ""Super5"" on your fav p2p software.Its breaking the law, but you may never see it in your life. But only buy this if you want some crap that will leave bad memorys of the end of the Dragon Ball saga"
3,Room to grow,"FUNimation announced long ago that it was starting in the middle of things with DBGT, making a composite of the first dozen or so episodes for the initial release with plans to release the full episodes later on. Those first episodes, as someone else said, were hated in Japan. So much so that, even after changing gears, the show never fully recovered and was cancelled far sooner than its forerunners. So FUNimation, for better or worse, decided to kick start the show this way.""Affliction,"" the foundation for the last tales of Dragon Ball, borrows much thematically from the later DBZ sagas. What still disappoint are the new character designs (GT picks up 10 years later, but Trunks looks younger in GT than he did at the end of DBZ) and even with the edits, one senses the real story won't begin till the gang gets back to Earth. Overall, the first DVD does what it needs to do, introduces us and sets up for the wild action to come that DB fans expect."
3,Will first 16 episodes be released. FUNimation says yes!,"For those of you like me who went out and bought this tape and saw the first episode on it and was thoroughly disappointed with it because of the ""butcher"" job they did on it, don't get too upset. That first episode ""A Grand Problem"" is not Episode 1 of the English language series. According to the FAQ on the official DBGT website, ""A Grand Problem"" is a ""primer"" episode that is meant to provide some exposition to what has happened in the series up to that point (about the 16th episode of the Japanese series). FUNimation was aware that Japanese audiences considered the first part of DBGT to be the weakest part of the series, so to generate strong interest in the beginning for the U.S. release, FUNimation mostly skipped over the first 16 episodes.So when will the actual beginning of DBGT be released in the U.S. in its entirety? It's hard to say, but hardcore Dragon Ball fans rest assured, according to FUNimation, it will be released someday."
3,Choppy but gets the job done.,"This may not be what most thought it would be and granted they did butcher it a bit. But look at it this way it is a Dragon ball z type of series. Also the original did not do so well. People hated it in Japan, so they just tried to revamp it, Corporate America give some lee-way. For those who may be concerned though it does still have good fights in it. I heard funimation did say that they would also come out with the originals. But if you are looking for some good old fighting then I would say buy it."
3,"Okay, but could have been better","Having never seen the Japanese episodes of Dragon Ball GT, I was a little lost when I purchased this movie. It seemed to jump right in the middle of an action sequence which had no explaining as to where, when or why; that is, until later on when they show BRIEF ""flashbacks."" I really was glad to have bought this video as I am a big DBZ fan, but I wish I could have been able to see the first 15 episodes previous; however, as I have discovered, FUNimation decided to jump right into the action instead of giving us the ""real story,"" which is rumored that they will be releasing the first 15 episodes later on.All in all, as long as you don't mind it being out of sequence, and having things explained briefly in flashback form, I would recommend this video for you."
3,Different for Joe,"I like to think of myself as pretty open-minded, and willing to follow Joe most anywhere he would go musically, but I was rather disappointed in this. Emphasis is on his slower, more introspective side. No more snotty tirades--he's growing, OK, but a lot of this music I think is pretty, but not terribly memorable. I like ""Ever After"" and ""Danny Boy""; the rest is very slick stuff with not much substance. The production is very clean to the point of antiseptic, electric keyboards and synthesized strings all about. Background music for sure. I was much more impressed with ""Heaven and Hell"", his next project, I believe--good ideas, good songs, novel arrangements."
5,Great product!,It's totally invaluable for checking on the baby in the middle of the night. Great product for a brand new parent.
1,"Arrives Bent, not good for online ordering!","Normally I love these curtain rods, however they are a horrible product to order online. Their cumbersome and awkward shape makes them difficult to package and ship, and in turn they arrive bent and unusable.If you like this type of curtain rod I would highly suggest buying them at your local home supply store (ACE, Target, Home Depot). They're great and sturdy, but should not be bought online."
5,Good heavy duty rods,"These didn't come right away but when I contacted the seller, I was contacted back 10 minutes later with a tracking report and an apology and offer of credit for the delay. I didn't really need a credit, they arrived today in time for my construction being finished. The rods are good and sturdy and the price was right. Thank you for the good response."
2,Arrived bent,I second the previous reviewer's comments. I ordered 2 rods and both arrived quite bent due to poor packaging and the flimsy nature of the rod.
1,not so heavy duty single curtain rod,"This product was damaged in transit, which makes me wonder how sturdy it will actually be when curtains are on it. I purchased it because it was supposed to be ""heavy duty"", but I was disappointed to open it and find that it was severely bent and unusable. I was supposed to have another one sent to me, but I have yet to receive it a week after the stated delivery for the replacement. Very unsatisfied customer."
4,A dear story with delicious pictures for young and old alike!,"The whole entire ""My First Little House Books"" series is a wonderful way to introduce little ones to the Little House series! The pictures are absolute feasts for little and big eyes alike!This story in particular is a great illustration of how Christmases used to be. It tells and illustrates the simple joys the children would experience at Christmas time - like candy canes, mittens, and for Laura - her own precious rag doll, Charlotte!Definately a book you will want to add to your little ones collection!"
5,Wonderful intro into the world of Little House,"The My First Little House series of picture books illustrated by Renee Graaf are fabulous. The stories are enchantingly adapted from the Laura Ingalls classics and are the perfect introduction for young readers ages 3-8. The soft illustrations in the style of Garth Williams are magical and stand on their own, but paired with the carefully chosen snippets of Ingalls own storytelling, they will capture any reader's imagination and foster a love of all things Little House."
4,Beginner's Little House books,This series of Little House books are perfect for the toddler and primary grade listeners. The illlustrations are captivating and in the style of Garth Williams and the text is simplified but true to the actual books. I am a literacy tutor and have found the original series perfect for introducing chapters and minimal illustrations. My second grader needed a little more picture and simpler text to become acquainted with the settings and characters. This series does the job splendidly. She is getting ready to begin LIttle House in the Big Woods in the new year.
4,Lovely and simple,"The full-color illustrations and easy text carry young readers (kindergarten) into the story, introducing them to Laura, Mary, Baby Carrie, Ma, Pa, and Jack the dog. The simplicity of the Christmas described is heart-warming and lovely. There is no controversy or drama in the book, just warmth and gladness among the family. Extremely well-done series of books."
3,Nice Introduction but is lacking....,"This book is a nice introduction to the REAL Little House books, but in reality it is lacking. If you want to introduce a 3-5 year old to the Laura Ingalls books then read the books TO them. You will be AMAZED at how much fun it is to read TO them and not just hand them a book full of pictures and continue on your way. Encourage questions and watch as you read for things they are not familiar with, and if you don't know the answer either or really what it means to ""Churn Butter"" then go to the library and find out. The real books are so great with their words that no pictures are really needed."
1,Junk,"I bought something similar in stores recently that used screws. They are all pretty flimsy, but work for the purpose I needed.I ordered these online which were slightly more expensive than the ones I bought in store, but it was worth it because I didn't want to go to the store just to get these.The product I received was cheapy nails, not screws, to hold them up. No matter how hard I hammered, they would not hold, they don't even secure when you hammer it all the way in, so the bars kept falling off.Had to throw them in the trash, and go buy the ones from the store."
4,amor o aroma,"Un libro maravilloso, irónico, original, muy poético. Me gustó mucho, aunque creo que no llega a 100 años de soledad, ni lo pretende. También me llamó la atención el hecho que el amor es tan ciego, intercambiable, las ganas que tenemos de vivirlo y encontrarlo superan nuestros instintos: si es Ulises o no lo es, en el fondo no importa tanto. Importan las primaveras con sus aromas que vuelven siempre para volvernos locos de deseo."
3,Tiene sus momentos,"No es una gran historia, tiene buenos momentos y pero tiene partes que son realmente tediosas, un hombre deja a su mujer embarazada y se larga por 20 años, regresapor que se da cuenta que aún ama a su mujer, pero esta ya se ha casado con otro hombre, en fin, se hacen amantes y por supuesto no hay final feliz.Si tienes duda renta la película y te darás una buena idea de lo que trata."
1,Doesn't live up to the magazine,"I love the Mental Floss magazine and blogs. I am a huge, huge fan. I was super excited to get this game. So, believe me when I say that this game is just not that good. It's not challenging, and two adults can complete it in under 15 minutes. I know this because every time I've played it, it's taken only that long--and I certainly don't mean that my friends and I were just so smart that we got through it quickly, I mean that it's just a very, very quick game. A game this quick is just not that fun to play. Some of the questions are moderate to difficult, but the vast majority have really obvious, simple answers that don't challenge the players. Easy, dull questions combined with a laughably short playing time mean that this game will not be taken off my shelf very often, if ever again. I considered giving it two stars, but I'm just so disappointed that Mental Floss would market this game that I had to knock it down a star."
2,Too easy,"My husband and I only played this game a couple of times. The questions and point system are too easy and we zipped through the game too quickly compared to other trivia games (e.g., Trivial Pursuit, Wit's End). A bit disappointing given everyone's review."
2,not what i expected,"The game's questions were a bit harder than the 'normal' adult may answer. It has rules and different types of questions that aren't fun, only distracting from the forward movement of the game. I would not recommend this game and unfortunately got rid of it already."
4,Good trivia game,"I borrowed this game from a friend who I gave it to as a gift. Up to six can play. You roll a die and move on the board. Where you land determines if you get a question for your right brain (pop culture), left brain (math & science) or spot the big fat lie (two statements are read, pick the one that's false). Correct answers earn you a ""piece of mind"" chip.There's also ""Enlightenment Round"" spaces on the board. You're read three statements. If you get all three right, you get a chip which you can risk to get another by answering one more question. A wrong answer loses the chip you just won. A right answer earns you another chip. It takes six chips to win the game.Each player or team gets two ""mental block"" cards that can hand in to give a second answer or try to steal an opponent's question. Overall a good game that will challenge you. A great choice for game or trivia nights."
4,In between Cranium and Trivial Pursuit,This game isn't as classic as Trivia Pursuit is but it certainly is better then Cranium (which I have no idea why people play).
5,Mental Floss Delivers!,"The creators of this board game are manically inventive. The cards spill over with kaleidoscopic humor and wit. The questions are composed in the way a magician performs tricks, with dazzle and slight of hand. The trivia category needed some flash, and Mental Floss delivers!Barbara FinsonSt.Paul, MN"
2,Some of the Trivia Questions are Wrong,"We were enjoying the game. Although the game play is extremely short (we were finishing games in 15 minutes), it had a good level of difficulty comparable with Trivial Pursuit.We were, however, surprised when we found two different questions that had the WRONG answers!!! The first said that the daughter in the Addam's Family TV show was Tuesday (when we all know it is Wednesday - confirmed by several sources on the internet) and the second said that the winter games in 1980 was in Moscow (the summer games in 1980 were in Moscow, the winter games were in Lake Placid - again confirmed by several sources online). It kind of throws into question the validity of the whole game.Don't you think someone would have fact checked?"
1,what a disapointment...,"I did not like this show AT ALL. I thought it was dull. The stories and the pictures were displeasing. If you want more erotic stories with better people, try RED SHOE DIARIES. I highly recommend it. That's what I call erotic."
2,A friend's wife,"This story is about the nightly gathering of middle-aged couples. Inside a private house and influenced with wine, wives prefer tochange their sleeping partners for the night. Their husbands tender no objections. No nakedness.A very week and impractical story. No supporting stimulus around."
4,Good product,"This was a good watch but not fully my tasts. I'm not fond of stories where some one is cheating on another person, it kind of deflates me but the stories were very good and was definatly erotic. If you don't mind those types of stories then I would say this is a great buy, if that's not really your thing I would say find something a little more like Hotel Erotica."
2,Disappointed,"I thought I would be blown away by Bliss, but was disappointed. I won't buy the second season."
1,Awful!,"This was a really bad movie. It contained some soft porn scences, but nothing too graphic. Overall it really was a waste of my money. I also don't know if anyone really gave this movie a serious review or just thought what the hell cute girl on the cover and bought it, but its trash. Please don't waste your money"
5,HOT! HOT! HOT!,"This is a really hot show. Although it does definitly leaving you ""longing"". It's definitly full of passion and good story line. The perfect show for women. It may leave you wanting more and for men it may not be steamy enough."
2,VERY BORING AND DISAPPOINTING,"Hello from Spain.I want to say two things:a) I thought it would be more steamy and romantic, but in fact it is very boring.b) This is not a Region 1 dvd because I have a European Sony dvd player which only plays Region 2 dvds or Region O dvds.Mrs Fenal"
2,not true to size,"Unfortunately, what Trotters describe as 6.5 must be a 5.5. If I had known I would have bought a size bigger than the one I did. These shoes are not roomy at all in the finger area. Their height is not balanced with the rest of the shoe either. A pity because they look nice. But they feel very uncomfortable. They crush my fingers terribly. I really wonder why. I have purchased other models from the same brand and they fit perfectly."
3,Looks are deceiving,"The pearl white shoe in the picture looks much more white than real-life. As for the fit, I am going to return them. They run small. I ordered 8 1/2 M, they say 8 1/2 but they are narrow and fit like an 8. There is no way I could walk comfortably in these shoes."
2,Bad Fit & Quality of Workmanship,Trotters Women's Jamie PumpMy wife had problems with one of the shoes that did not fit her well and the quality of workmanship was not up to par considering the cost for these shoes. Won't probably order from this vendor in the future.
3,Updated average 2.5,"Review update 6/11/10: I ordered this for my father (30 lbs Jindo) because I have another one for mine (26 lbs Jindo), which is working great, and it is strongest Flexi leash but, I guess it is not. Once I pull the leash tape out from the handle, it does not retract back. I am guessing the tape spring in the mechanism is broke. I contacted the seller and asked for warranty so, let's see what happen. Technically the rate for this one is 2.5 (Mine still works great so its 5 + this one is 0 / two - average score for both = 2.5Previous review: Perfect leash. I could not find it from local pet stores. anyway good construction and free for your dog to sniff arund and retrieve espcailly walking on the street."
2,"Good for ""Tubular Bells"" and ""Sentinel""","I was dissapointed when I heard this album. I heard that his album Tubular Bells was a popular album and I remember hearing ""Sentinel"" on the radio. So, I bought the cassette just to give it a try. After hearing the album, I was dissapointed that Sentinel was different than the other songs on the album. There were a few good instrumentals but I still didn't like most of the album. Mike Oldfield uses a unique mixture of sounds in his music and he includes a few voices as well. Some of his songs I would not even classify as new age, like ""Shadow On The Wall"" since it sounds like rock music and doesn't have good vocals. Even if you are a Mike Oldfield fan, I would still recomment listening to the album before you buy it."
4,pokemon,"I don't see why everyone seems to hate it, but theres nothing wrong with pokemon. The anime is on the G/PG side but that's ok. It is generally fun to watch and remains entertaining through the whole series. So if you haven't seen pokemon yet, don't listen to what everyone says and check it out."
5,Just what I need,Just what I need to be able to tow a U-Haul trailer with my Chev Trailbazer. Just poke it into the socket under the bumper
5,Works as advertised,"Works just like it says it does. Cheap (cost) and it works. Fits good into the socket and has a test light built in.No complaints at this point, for the price I wouldn't hesitate to buy."
5,nice adapture,This is the nicest one Ive seen and it plugged in perfect also like the plastic cover to keep pins from getting wet when not in use
4,Hoppy works great but it's a bit loose,"Received the adapter, plugged it in and was off and running. Only issue with this is that it's a bit loose in the 7 pin connector. Since I haven't taken it out on a long drive I'm not sure if it will fall out while on the road. I'm thinking of a bungee cord or something else that can hold it in place using the 'wings' on the sides."
5,Just what I needed!,Chevy Silverado+CarMate trailer=need 7-to-4 adapter. This one is awesome with the handy little LEDs to show that the socket is working before you even plug the trailer in.
5,works perfect,great to have in the glove box just in case you need it. IF you need it and you dont have it your screwed bigtime. buy 1 just for safty
2,Works only as an adapter,"Not sure why, but my this adapter doesnt light up to do the checks as it is suppose to. I think it is my suv (Audi) that doesnt support just the leds to verify operation. I kept it anyway as it works fine with the trailer and all the lights work."
3,"""Not what I expected, but good...""","Even though this is a Hey Arnold movie and I am a huge fan of the show, I just didn't think this was a good movie. After about 3/4 of the movie it got kind of boring, they should have started it off like a normal episode, like Arnold at school, or maybe Arnold getting up in the morning, we should've seen more of Arnold's grandpa and grandma, but his grandma doesn't appear much during the movie and neither does his granpa. But it was pretty funny when Mr. Hyunn, Oscar, and Grandpa were in the sewer, that was pretty good. Even though I am a huge fan of Hey Arnold, this just wasn't what I expected, but I still recommend it to any Hey Arnold fan."
1,THE TERRIBLENESS IS BEYOND MEASURABLE,"this movie was TERRIBLE. ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE. WHAT ARE YOU PEOPLE ON. The animation had little more put into it than one of those 1 and 1/2 hour ""movies"" shown on nickelodeon. SAME THING WITH THE PLOT. IT OPENLY CONTRADICTED ITSELF. A 6 YEAR OLD COULD SEE THAT. And, another thing - with the exception of the lines from Arnold's grandparents - IT WASNT FUNNY. AT ALL."
1,If I Could I Would Rate This ZERO,"This stupid movie is nothing more but a long tv episode of the stupid cartoon Hey Arnold.The plot sort of sounds like last years Recess schools out(i liked that one)!It doesnt teach kids anything about life but about stupid super agents,They need to get some new ideas and stop copying off other movies!"
2,it's ok.,they try to find pepole to save the neighborhood.THROUGH THE WHOLE MOVIE........ BORING.OK sotheres afew good parts.
5,A Great Film,"I have watched the TV Series for many years and I really enjoyed this film, and still I wish they continue the series since a lot of the episodes from the series are funny."
4,"If You Like The Show, You'll Like The Movie!","If you like the cartoon ""Hey Arnold"" how can you not enjoy this episode? As is the case with most Nickelodeon films this movie is basically a long episode of the TV show. The characters are the same, the plot is similar and it is quite enjoyable. I think children or adults would like this movie.4 Out Of 5 Stars."
3,Could have been better,"My three children and I have watched this show since the beginning, and as an avid fan of Hey Arnold, I was extremely anxious to see the movie. While I did enjoy the movie, I did find that the plot was shallow, and out of the show's character. The newest episodes of the show... surrounding the story of Arnold's parents... would have made a much better movie."
4,Fast-moving Enjoyable Flick for the Whole Family,"As an adult viewer, I found this film very entertaining, with more of the charm of the TV series and a fast-moving tale as Arnold, Gerald and company try to save their neighborhood from the wrecking ball.Kids can enjoy the animation, while adults can enjoy the interesting character perks Craig Bartlett has bestowed on even the most minor characters. Think about it: how few TV programs aimed at adults have such well-defined peripheral characters as Big Bob Pataki?The film gets to the point right away in the first few minutes, so pay attention. And then enjoy watching the football-head save his neighborhood, and teach us all what's really important... saving our heritage!"
4,A smart kid,I've been a fan of Hey Arnold the show since the beginning the movie wasn't that bad except that you knew the ending as soon as the movie started however the movie did have its exciting parts I suggest you rent it the first day it comes out on video
