4,long and loopy,"These wires are longer than the ones I replaced. I turned the boot on the coil pack to make them work, hence loopy. After a little more research, I found that GM used a different coil pack on some 2004-2005 models that require a longer plug wire. Regardless of the length, these wires are excellent and I have no doubt about Bosch quality and you can't beat the price at half off. These are really five star wires that are too long for a perfect fit. Don't forget the dielectric grease."
3,Not an exact repleacement,"In researching wires for my 2002 Chevy Sivarado 2500HD I found there were 2 different lengths. After asking at 4 different places and getting 4 different answers as to whick fit my application I bought these because of a review that said they were long. I figured I handle long rather than short. I didn't know they are 3 inches long. Much more of a ""universal"" fit than custom lenght. Good quality good price and they work ok, just not stock length."
1,A Total Waste to Any NORMAL Person,"If you don't have a specifically bred pointer dog, if you don't have easy access to grouse for your dog to get familiar with, and if you aren't a college professor of the english language, then this book will be USELESS for you. This book requires you to be an already experienced person in hunting with a pointer. The training in this book depends on the fact that the dog is already interested in birds and sees them every day. Also, this book is almost impossible to understand for anyone with a normal education, that is less than a doctorate in english. Total waste of my money, and I think my dog is worse off in training then he was before I got this book. Not a good choice for getting training info. for your dog."
1,Dissappointment - great title but the content does not deliver,great title but the content does not deliver. I can't say I came away learning anything new. The author rants on about her personal frustrations with the Catholic church and others.
2,The body never lies,"Wasnt what I expected, didn't really find much help in this book. Very disappointed as Alice Millar was highly recommended from her work with Dysfunctional families"
4,Uncovering hidden trauma's,"Alice Miller has a point when she says that with the 4th commandment in the Bible, parents have the approval to dominate over their children and demand honor and respect. Many children have suffered at the hands of their parents and have been hurt, confused and scarred for life. Not knowing how to put an end to the verbal and physical abuse, kids end up with trauma's and psychological problems.However, there is a need to distinguish between a loving parent and a 'licensed abusive parent'. The 4th commandment does not license abuse, nor any other harmful treatment of children. AM speaks of her own experience, and that of many others, but the Bible commands parents to love their children at the risk of their own lives, Matthew 18:6.This book is a must read for all that have suffered at the hands of parents, educators and clergy."
5,Amazing Book! A Must Read!,This is one of the best and shortest of all of Alice Miller's deeply profound and important books. Details the effects on the body of child abuse. Very interesting!! I highly recommend it.
3,Disappointing.,"The author presents her history and method as the only one to be used, and as a sweeping generalization of what should be done to deal with childhood parenting that leaves much to be desired. I also found this to be written for therapists as opposed to the lay reader. It has some good insights and observations, but overall a disappointing read."
3,Interesting,"Has some interesting information, but I found it too repetitive and tiring. The sample book was more attractive than the product itself."
5,Ear Cleaner,The vet recommended this for my dog's ear and I have used it since then. Its great for cleaning out all the ear wax.
3,stinks and causes asthma attacks,This product doesn't seem to work in my standard poodles ears....and the smell is awful...it causes asthma attacks everytime I use it.
5,Great deal on Amazon,"I am sooo glad I found this solution on Amazon,I couldn't find it in my local pet stores.It works Great and smells Great too!! It was also a Great Deal on Amazon too!!!!!"
3,Guilty Pleasure,"The title is 'Night of the Crabs'. That should pretty much give you an idea of what you're in for. If this were a movie this would probably be a 'C' movies thrown in to pad out the programming line-up. You know the kind? the cheesy badly acted kind that you likely love watching but would never admit to.That's this book. It's a one-note book , you know the note well and yes it does deliver on the promised note. It is Good Bad Eco-Horror and I'm already reading my way through the rest of the series."
4,good buy,"Great price for features, I really shopped around. Only negative is that all 6 plug slots seem to be ""on battery' and I would have preferred to have several to function only as a surge protector and not to use back up battery power in case of power failure."
1,Poor Quality,The movie was poor from the start. Just poor filming and acting. The movie quit about 1/2 way through and I didn't even care.
3,"Laptop AC Adapter for Compaq Presario 2100 2500 Series, Business...","I gave this item an okay rating because it is somewhat loose and does not grip the connection very well. If I move the unit while it is plugged in, the plug will become unattached very easily."
5,Excellent Product,This review was written in error. I was actually rating a different product. This one was excellent. Better than OEM.
5,Dad Loves!!,"Purchased for my father, and he is able to work on his very outdated laptop. He is happy and I was glad I was able to find, was worried since the lap top is so outdated."
3,hella halogen bulb,"Light is good. Good field of vision, but not as bright as I had hoped for a halogen bulb.Also, had an issue with receiving the item. It arrived 5 days after requested delivery date."
5,Stealing Freedom,Ozi Sander Stealing FreedomElisa CarboneStealing Freedom is a book about a girl that is a slave. She and her family are torn apart by their master. The master did this bad thing because he wanted to spread a family apart. A man named Jacob had only enough to buy most of the family but one thing that he didn't have enough money to buy was the daughter. So they are ripped apart and all Jacob can do is try to help her steal her freedom that she always wanted. I really liked this book a lot. One reason that I liked this book is because of the way it was written. It was told kind of like a journal. I would really recommend this book to anybody that likes adventure books\history books.
3,Better Never.,"My friend bought me this cd for my birthday-I wish he hadn't.I really didn't enjoy listening to it,its rather silly.I gave it 3 stars because I didn't want to be too mean."
3,very roomy but sooo big,"GOsh this is huge!! I am traveling to Hawaii with a toddler and need to be able to access my identification, etc. This is much too large to put under a shirt unless it is a big bulky t-shirt, not anything fitted. I like it b/c I can actually drop a trifold wallet in it and my cellphone. THe cord is so long that I am going to wear it across my body, that way it is easy accesible, safe and it won't hang ang swing off my neck when I am bending over tending to my toddler. It's a good buy."
4,"Not bad, but not perfect","I bought this guy three years ago to replace a Jansport. I loved the fact that it was a little bigger than the neck wallet I was replacing which was used for international travel.However while it hold all my documents very nicely, it is about 3cm too short to hold boarding passes or tri-folded reservations exactly, resulting in the tips being bent downward. While, I own many Victorinox products (knives and watches) I was a bit surprised that this guy wasn't up to the snuff.Don't get me wring it's a fine quality document holder, but it's a little too short to be perfect."
3,"Not bad, but didn't blow my socks off either...","Pretty good overall, but seems kind of pricey for the functionality. The stud finder isn't all that great. If you don't find a nail location it often misses the stud. The electrical wire detector function, on the other hand, works just fine. It is a very nice safety feature that I didn't have on my old detector. The unit sticks reasonably well to clean walls so long as they are not textured too heavily. It's really good in bathrooms to line-up tiles on the green board. Had real problems on lightly textured walls though. The laser level line is easily visible for about 10' on either side of the tool, plenty long for most household applications. It's larger and bulkier than expected, making it less ergonomic than desirable (unless you have pretty big hands). If I had it to do all over again I would almost certainly choose another brand."
1,Too big and not accurate,I purchased this laser product thinking I would use it for various applications around the house. After trying it in several application I noticed some major problems with the unit. First off it is very large and bulky. The mechansim to affix it to the wall is very unreliable and mine fell off the wall several times. The last major problem is that the self leveling device does not acutally self level. I used a level and found the laser to be very inaccurate. The price does not warrant the tool.
3,Vertical capability badly needed,"The Bullseye Laser has many good features such as handsfree,studfinder,self-leveling and price. However it could be nearly perfect with the addition of a vertical laser line. This would provide the ability to stay vertically on the stud once located and to align several points or objects on a plumb line. One more laser eye perpendicular to the other two and pointing up through a hole in the top of the Bullseye should not affect the self-leveling machanism and would give the user right, left and vertical choices simultaneously. This addition would make this a 5-star tool.If I have missed this capability or if B&D; has an upgraded series or model with the vertical option please let me know."
2,Too Big And Bulky,"I didn't realize you needed to hammer a nail in the wall to keep it in place. I tried to use it to run a hand rail for the stairs and discovered it only works on a true horizontal, you can't use it any other way but horizontal, not vertical or any angle in between. The size of the unit surprised me. It was too big to put in my tool belt. If you want to hang a shelf or picture it works fine, but that's about all you can use it for."
4,Black & Decker BDL110S BullsEye Laser Level Stud Sensor,"i got tis for 14 bucks, love it. the auto ajust laser is the best. it comes with the case pretty nice looking."
3,Buy the Strait-Line version!,"I have both the Black and Decker laser level and the Strait-Line version - and I MUCH prefer the Strait-Line one! The Black & Decker version is much less accurate. It does have the advantage of having a stud-finder built in - something the Strait-Line one doesn't have (though they make one separately that works great too!). The stud-finder part works well, so for that I give it 3 stars. :)"
3,It's ok...,This product is ok for a light amateur use. That's all I needed.It's not a pro tool. Not even close. Keep looking if that's what you want.
1,Stud Finder Works but Laser Level is a bust,"We purchased the B&D laser level/stud finder as a Xmas gift for my father-in-law. Unfortunately, the level was a duplicate gift for him with a Craftsman laser level. I got the B&D level as a result. I hung two pictures up side-by-side using the B&D laser level with its ""self-leveling"" mechanism. Needless to say I have two uneven pictures on the wall. I needed to take out my old level to fix what the laser level messed up. Meanwhile, my father-in-law has nothing but great things to say about the Craftsman.The stud finder works but for $60+, it's an expensive one. Also, the ""wall mounting"" feature I feel is misleading. You can mount it to the wall for hands free use only by placing essentially a nail sized pin into the wall for it to hang. Who wants extra holes in the wall?I've returned the B&D level and hoping no issues with the return from Amazon! The laser level is a useful tool, but it needs to actually work!"
1,"there is a stud here, I swear","The stud finder is absolutely worthless. Approaching a known stud, the stud finder would ""locate"" the stud +/- 6"". Using several scans, I would mark each spot the stud finder had indicated and try to discern some pattern which would indicate where the stud actually was. Sadly, it became obvious that simply tapping on the wall and listening to the tone was a far more accurate and speedy way to find the studs.The laser is about 1/8"" thick. I would prefer something much thinner."
1,not very good design,"I had my eye on this for quite a while and just bought it. I immediately took it back, when I saw how you mount it to the wall. You have to use one of the accompanying pins (which only work on drywall) or use your own screw or nail. I REALLY don't like the idea of putting any hole in my wall if it's not necessary. The main reason why I bought it was so i'm not putting holes all over my wall to hit a stud or to get level. I honestly don't think they put a lot of thought into this."
3,"Nice idea, but too expensive for limited features.","It was the first consumer laser level I'd seen, so I bought it on impulse. It has been handy a few times, but I broke the push pin used to hold it on the wall after only a couple of uses. Not a big deal, just use a thumb tack. The stud-sensor is okay... I've never really found one that consistently works, so my expectations weren't very high. But my biggest gripe is the price. If it did vertical lines, it might be a little more useful, and therefore worth the money. I think I would have been happier buying just a dedicated laser level..."
1,"Not worth the money, not that great","When I first got mine (about 2 years ago), I thought it was awesome until I started to use it on almost a daily basis.1) Its very difficult to use it by yourself because you cant really hang it on the wall to keep your hands free. It does come with a pin that you can use, but I broke it after the first couple days. Toothpicks work well but you have to drill a hole first.2) The stud finder seems to be touchy...sometimes it will say there is a stud, then you rescan the area it says that there is no stud.3) I dont trust the level over long walls."
5,Good part,"Great part, great price. Fit perfectly and much much cheaper price than the local parts stores wanted. You can't go wrong with it."
1,Incompetent fluff leaves Darwinism unchallenged,"Directed at the non-science-literate, The Facts of Life does nothing more than parrot tired old creationist saws that were debunked decades ago. Much of the book contains gross factual errors that are easy to check with only a moderate background in science and the rest is little more than a rehash of claims that range from patently false to simply ignorant. Much of the book is based on information that was superceded long before the book was written, suggesting that Milton's own research is shallow at best. A true embarrassment that isn't even as interesting a read as other creationist books like Behe's Darwin's Black Box or the rants of Phillip Johnson, The Facts of Life is a guaranteed candidate for the remainder table and a complete waste of time for anyone who wants to know the facts of the issue."
1,Opticon,"Being a huge fan of both remixes in general, a mega Orgy fan, and this being my favorite song by them, I figured this would really rock. Thing is these remix veer far far from the original ""Opticon"" on their V.T. CD that they aren't enjoyable. I did like 2 remixes however, tracks 4 & 5. They stick to the original closer than the rest, but the other tracks sound like new songs altogether."
1,"ViewSonic P220f 22"" Flat CRT Monitor","Don't expect a clean screen on this monitor. It will come with visible horizontal lines 1/4 and 3/4 of the way down from the top of the screen and they are annoying when you have a light background or a dark background. If your background is black they may not show. Don't spend your money on this monitor. I was very diappointed for the price I paid. ViewSonic says this:Two faint horizontal lines on my monitor screenThe two lines you see are called horizontal damper wires. These damper wires are required to maintain the aperture grille's alignment and will cast a shadow on the screen. In most applications, these lines will blend into the background, but they will be visible against lightly-colored screens. They are an integral part of the technology and are not considered a defect.Why doesn't ViewSonic disclose these lines in the specs?"
3,Interesting Few Flaws though,"It's got a lot of good info and tons of pictures, but some stars are missing and the info is a bit inaccurate (ie. They say Peter Boyle died in 1990, how can he when he's playing Frank on Everybody Loves Raymond!) It helps you figure out the names of those rarly seen stars from your favorite low-budget films, but hardy gives much info on people you want to know about, no Marty Feldman, Elvis Presley, Dudley Moore, Rick Moranis, Paul Rebuans, or anyone the same, but take it as it is."
2,False Advertising,"The jacket was listed as ""Marmot Minimalist Jacket"" & the product description that followed when I clicked on it described it as such also. It seemed to be an amazing price fot the coat (about 25% the regular price), so I went for it. Not till the I ordered it, did it appear that is was in fact the ""Marmot Precip Jacket"". Now as I write my review, it says I'm reviewing the ""Marmot Precip Jacket"", but if I search for ""Marmot Minimalist Jacket"", this exact jacket that I ordered pops up. It was still a good price for the coat, so I am keeping it, but it is & was falsely advertised."
5,Kate,"I did quite a bit of ""research"" before deciding on this rain jacket, and I'm pleased with it. I wanted the pit zips, brim on the hood, and the brown color. It is light weight, a flattering shape and true to size.One other reviewer didn't like the Velcro down the front flap, on cuffs, and on pockets, but I actually like it......makes me feel all sealed up in wind or rain!"
3,PreCip size runs small,The features of this jacket were as described by the various sellers. I found that the size wasn't quite right...smaller than other rainwear and jackets I own.
3,Hollow gum balls,"I have been buying gumballs for my bank for the grandkids for years.This time I ordered four bags and when I got them I couldnt believe it. All the yellow ones were hollow, no gum inside, also some of the white ones were empty. I had to throw them away. I think I should get some kind of a credit! Product name is Carousel Gumball Refills."
3,I've had better Gum,"After reading previous reviews, I ordered these gumballs. I found that some of the gumballs tasted funny and all of the gum became hard to chew and stale after a couple minutes. Not terrible, but you can find better, like double bubble."
1,Questionable product,"As far as the CD itself is concerned, it is definitely not an authorized release, let alone original. ""Syntax Distribution"" listed on sleeve, with no other info - no linear notes, no copyright date, no release date, nothing. Printed on top right-hand corner of the front (sleeve) were the words ""UNCOMPRESSED AUDIO"". Dead give-away that this is a boot-leg.I sent my copy back and got a refund.As for the band, this was the last recording VR ever released; but the only main member was Roger Martinez -- who's a very proud (and bitter) satanist these days. Take it for what it's worth, I guess."
2,it has its moments,"As said in the title, it has its moments. But othrt than that its not funny. Its very dragged out im the begining and starts late"
1,Don't buy this CD!!,"This is a bootleg CD and it's not even Bobby singing on ""I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus""!!"
5,Adam-12 Returns!,"I am so happy that Shout Factory is releasing Adam-12 Season 2. I cannot believe the first season did not sell well enough to release the rest of the series. Shout Factory is becoming a favorite company of mine. They have also had some releases of Ozzie & Harriet(my favoriet sitcom ever!). I also hope to see them pick up the rights to Dragnet and release the rest of that series. It is also time for Emergency to have another release. Finally, I would love to see the rest of T.J. Hooker released by Shout Factory and have some interviews with the stars of the shows."
1,Only if you have to...,I had to get this for a class. It is poorly written with contradictions in some chapters. I expect a well articulated book with thorough research. The authors try to pass others pseudo research as solid information. Once I'm done with this class I just can't wait to sell this book.
5,Good place for hard to find items,"Thanks for helping me look like the ""Best Husband"" when my wife opened the present and saw the headcover to replace the one she lost earlier. Amazon is a good place to search for those ""hard-to-find"" items. I had gone to several local retailers without any success. The Amazon resources are good. And once I found the head cover, the overall customer service by Amazon and the retailer was very good. From the time the order was placed to the time the order was sent and received, the communications was very good and timely."
4,A Great Mouse,"I just recently bought this mouse and I think its great. They give you two ways to connect it to your computer, by either USB port or PS/2 mouse port. Installation was a snap using their software. I had it working in seconds and I'm not computer literate. This item also shipped really fast. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I felt the cords are a little too short. I ended up taking both cords and connecting them together. Overall its a great product with a fantastic price."
1,"Looks nice, but has an annoying problem","I've used this mouse for over a year thinking that mac OS X had a weakness where scroll wheels are concerned. No matter what application I used (web browsers, Word, Acrobat) the text would always jitter when the scroll reached either the upper or lower limit and ultimately stopped at some random place. After trying a generic scroll wheel mouse I discovered that it worked perfectly without needing to install special software. My experience with the Iridio was bad, but is thankfully over."
5,Southern Comfort in a Book,"Top Rating!Normandy Ellis is to literature what the Allman Brothers and Little Feat are to music. Culture and tradition are woven together with grit and realism as beans and rice find their place together on the plate. In short, you must read this book to consider yourself literate (unless you are an ignorant carpetbagger)."
3,"Liked, Not love.",I watched American Hustle: The movie and thought the comedians were funny that were traveling with Katt. So I bought this. It's more of a behind the scenes thing than anything. I was hoping to maybe see a whole set of each comedian. And my case was cracked and broken a little when I received it. But I still like it none the less.
4,Funny,"I ordered this for my uncle he Loves it,Loves it..... On the other hand; me I don't watch Katt Williams as much as I use too, but when I did watch I like too. He is a talented person that will keep you laughing he is very funny."
3,OK,"i expected more from Katt, but the word is that he's falling off. That is, if he hadn't already...."
1,Katt Williams presents Katt house comedy,"Maybe I misunderstood the title, but Katt Williams is no where on this dvd. The 3 so called comedians on it STINK."
3,K.M Acevedo,I was looking forward to seeing more Katt on this video. Not as funny as I thought it was going to be. Received very quickly. Will do business again.
1,Not good for beginners,"This set is not a good learning set for the beginner. The book is nice, but the cds are not helpful at all. The words in Russian by the male and female speaker is spoken once, while you look at the book, and then the English translation is spoken right after. I returned this, and will go with something else."
2,Complete Russian: The Basics (BK) (Complete Basic Courses),We only received the book we did NOT receive the CD and Dictionary.WE would appreciate receiving those 2 items.
5,Engaging Profiles of Baseball's Greastest Teams,"How many times have you heard your ballclub's broadcast team say that ""you can't compare teams across eras""? If you think that it is great fun to try, then I strongly reccommend BASEBALL DYNASTIES. I expected this one to be my favorite baseball book this spring and I was not disappointed. When it comes to the great teams, Neyer and Epstein take the reader off the beaten narrative; they don't just rehash the stats. A less interesting book might be content to tell you that the 1986 Mets were a cocky team. BASEBALL DYNASTIES provides you with a description of each of their brawls. The book also makes use of some well-conceived and easily-grasped analytical tools that illuminate some of those treacherous cross-era comparisons. Terrific fuel for one baseball's most enjoyable arguments."
5,most excellent,"This is a wonderful book! Rob and Eddie are two very intelligent people, and their book combines the right amount of hard analysis and entertaining anecdotes. It is both insightful and entertaining, and nothing short of required reading for fans everywhere!"
5,Perfect!,"Buy this book if for no other reason than challenging your preconceptions of which are the greatest teams ever...Even though it sometimes wonders into complicated use of some statistics (as sabermatics will usually seem to do if you're not really into them), this book works wonders in presenting numerical and analytical justification for ranking the best dynasties in the game. This is not based on subjective reasoning (""they're my home team!""), but rather on deep study and discussion.You may not agree with all the choices, or with the final rankings (one per author), but you will not be able to say that Eddie and Rob (my favorite ESPN.com writer) didn't do their homework.You'll be surprised to learn lots of information from all these teams that you wont find in many other books (let alone ONE book), and it will leave you wanting more...wanting to see how YOUR favorite teams rank against these dynasties."
5,72-74 A's,"To Bryan Lutes of Aurora, Illinois: The 72-74 A's are covered in the book. They are covered in Chapter 15. They are one of the fifteen teams that are rated as great dynasties."
1,Felicia Day's Elf ears destroyed this for me...,"I did enjoy this web series on DVD, however honestly the poor quality elf ears on Felicia Day stuck out like a MOLE that kept my eyes looking at how poor they were. This one aspect really ruined this web series for me so much that I tossed the DVD in the trash.Over all I did enjoy the web series except when Felicia was on screen.. Then we are back to the ears problem. I did like all of the other chars and I even liked her character. It was once again a problem with the ears..Did I mention the ears? Dear god just CG out those ears and reissue this video. Anything would be better..."
3,Good actors but poor story,I especially like Felicia Day and think she is a really great actress. Unfortunately the story plot is rather poor.
2,"Sadly, this doesn't make the cut","I wanted to like this. I totally admire the tremendous writing, etc., that Felicia Day brings to The Guild.But here the dialogue is uneven, the story is just okay, and the acting is clunky. Wooden describes Adam Rayner as the male lead. Day's acting was good at times and freaking awkward at other times; just not convincing. The only actor who seemed to dive into their role nicely was Marcia Battise.Sadly, it ends up coming off more as a good LARP adventure with decent costumes rather than a good series.Verdict: Watch on the net and buy the DVD if you really want to watch it a second time."
3,As a DA fan...,"I purchased this based on the voice performance from ""mark of the assasin"". Taking into account that it was a web series its not the worst thing that I've ever endured (w/out a paddle 2 takes that hands down). Take a look online for one of the episodes before you purchase it on DVD"
3,Not worth buying,"The small web series is enjoyable to watch, but not for the current price of $14.95. For me there is no re-playability, unlike Felicia's The Guild series. I thought the acting was a bit lacking to be honest and not enough in the episodes. Save your money for future works by Felecia Day and watch this online."
2,"Meh. Watched Online, Played Game","I'm a fan of Dragon Age and Dragon Age 2 games (PC). I've finished the DLC ""Mark of the Assassin"" and sadly found Felicia Day's voice acting, annoying and not believable in comparison to voice acting in Dragon Age and Dragon Age 2. I'm not sure if this is due to the writers for the DLC game, production time/cost etc.Mark of the Assassin is supposed to be intertwined with DA: Redemption, so I watched the first two episodes online. I really tried to like it because I am a fan of the series, but I had the same issues with believability. It seems to be a small budget production and the uneven acting abilities shows. The story line could use some help, too.Seriously though, it's really hard to translate games/comic books onto film. It has been done but you need a director with vision and a budget to match.Unless you're a huge fan, I would not spend the money on the DVD."
1,"Not worth it, even on sale.","Acting is terrible - writing is mediocre, and the fact that it's supposed to be related to the Dragon Age series leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Big DA fan, and though I admittingly don't get the hype about Felicia Day, I couldn't get over the poor scripting and bad plot pacing to enjoy this as a fan of the DA franchise. Opening and ending sequences were too long considering the middle content - kind of like a sandwich where the filling was a single piece of cheese. Okay if you like cheese, I suppose, but most would agree more content and a beefier, tastier story would have been more satisfying.TL;DR - Watch it for free online, it's not worth owning."
2,Not worth purchasing.,"As a huge fan of The Guild and Dragon Age, I was looking forward to this mini-series.What a letdown. The canon is pretty much set aside, the only interesting characters take far too long to introduce. Talis could have been an interesting concept, but could not carry a DLC and this on her own merits. The world would have been better served with a short story co-written by Day and Gaider.And let's not forget - Day obviously subscribes to the Guidelines of Whedon in this.Streaming (on youtube), it could be worth a few minutes of your time. I would not put down money, no matter how much I adore the Dragon Age franchise."
3,What can I say? It's a web series.,"It's not great. It's a Low budget web series, what do you expect? Felicia Day at least tries and she pulls out an average performance (at best), but she is the only character who stands out in the whole series. The other character's are generic, unlikeable, and over act. The swords, staffs and other weapons looked like you can buy them at a Toys R Us. I will say that the outfits were pretty good though.What I like about it, was that it did play well off the Lore of the Dragon Age Games. If anything at all I enjoyed the story and thought it was a pretty average web series, and the price is fair enough. Although I recommend you save that money for something else, like the new Mass Effect Anime coming out soon."
5,Great amp for the money,"For the price you CANT go wrong. This amp will easily push almost any sub or 2. I have hooked it up to 2 L5 12"" and sounded great. 600 watts RMS is plenty for almost any setup. Has all the standard stuff. Reliable as well...not one of those cheap piles of crap like boss or pyle or DHD. Lasted me 5 years so far and still working great."
5,not good for component sets,this amp is not good for a component set cuz it only plays between 11hz and 330hz because it is a sub amp. i have it hooked to a head unit with 5 volt pre-outs and the power is awesome. great sub amp!!!! 5-stars
3,Not good for all night use,"The CDs are ok, but will not work for overnight use if you are a light sleeper (which I thought was the need for these). The fade out effect at the end of the CDs will throw off your brain, and wake you up. If that doesn't, the squiggly sound of the CD player going back to the beginning of the CD to start over, will."
2,Misleading Title,"This book should be titled something like: ""Things to Think About When Planning a Wedding"". It contained very little money saving tips, which is why I bought the book."
2,Misleading Title,"This was disappointing--to keep the budget down depended on keeping the number of guests WAY down, below normal expectations. Anyone can plan a modestly-priced wedding for 60 people. I had expected more along the lines of ""serving your guests a lovely dinner for under $10 a head"" similar to magazine articles I've seen in the past. This book is not worth the money to buy it, nor even the time to read it."
5,"A ""must read"" for any bride and groom","This is a terrific book that brings a wedding from the ""vision"" of what a bride may want and matches it to the financial reality of hosting a major party. It makes you really think about the things that are important to you about your wedding - and how much that is going to affect your overall budget. Most of us don't have an endless supply of money to spend on a wedding and reception, but even if you do this book is a great guide to helping you prioritize what really matters to you."
1,I would not recommend it for saving money,"This is not a complete waste of money. It does have a cute way about the way it is written, however the tips for saving money are not very innov&#8203;ative."
2,redundant and not about budgeting at all,"This was a very redundant book to every other check list out there, except that it wasn't even interestingly written. It has nothing to do with how to lower your expenses and if you really pay attention, since they are coordinators themselves, it seems pretty obvious to me that it isn't in their interests to keep wedding costs down."
3,Not that helpful,"I agree with the reader from LA- this is a nice basic book on how to plan a wedding, but it didn't have any actual tips on how to save money other than plan far ahead and talk to lots of people. I liked the tone of the book, and there was some good information on how to organize and plan, but after reading it I have no idea how to put together an elegant wedding for $5000."
4,Good Advice for the Budget-minded,"""How to Have an Elegant Wedding for $5,000 or less"" worked for us. I had a pretty wedding with an outdoor ceremony and indoor reception for 120 people for $4,055 this June 2004. And that included my elegant spaghetti-strapped split-front white gown from Kauffman's. I used fake/silk flowers - they lasted through the June sunshine and the photo shoot at the local prepatory school. And there's nothing wrong with borrowing or renting things, or even making them yourself. It cuts down on the costs and still provides the elegant effect you want. This book by Jan Wilson and Beth Wilson Hickman showed me that fact, and gave me many useful hints."
2,Save the Money for your Wedding,I was very diappointed.I found very little money saving tips in this book.I wanted to find ways to have everything I want and still save money. This book mostly tells you to cut things out or ask guests to do stuff for you. I would not recommend it at all.
1,Not as shown.,"I specifically ordered this item because it was the white helmet/pants version. I paid more money for this small difference from the standard gray version. When it arrived, it was not the white as shown, it was the cheaper gray! I could've saved myself atleast $20 elsewhere. I am not a satisfied customer. I only gave it a rating because I had to, personally I feel it is misleading and deserves a ZERO!"
1,Illuminatus it ain't,"Setting aside the clumsy prose, awkward plotting, and lifeless descriptions, this book fails by having very little to say.The narrator repeatedly refers to the ""terrible things he has discovered"" without deigning to reveal them. He stumbles upon a vast consipiracy ... whose purposes beyond chasing him around are never revealed. In capable hands, this kind of mystery can work, but in this case it reads like the author simply lacked the ability to execute on his ambitions.Occasional cracks about materialism and the cluelessness of the public at large are the book's weak effort at social criticism. The book reads like the work of a bright but over-ambitious teenager. Get your conspiracy and satire fix somewhere else."
4,"Awesome Guide for Plants that are ""In Bloom"".","This is a fantastic book for those that love the wildflowers of the Kansas Prairie. I have not found and easier guide to help me learn and ID Kansas wildflowers. However, if you are interested in the taxonomy and ID prior to or beyond the flowering stage, of those plants that interest you, this book may disappoint you. I would not fail to recommend it to like minded associates. Peace!"
2,"Poor Construction, No durability","Broke within a few 'clacks' of the board, clearly the board has been pre used(ordered new). There are paint spots as if someone tried to fix it. Poor construction. Clapper is wobbly."
5,Inner Reaches of Outer Space.,"Always good to get a Joseph Campbell book. Every age sees his ideas in a new perspective, so having any of his books at any age and rereading and rereading, is always a plus and interesting revelation.What a phenomenal mind!!!!"
4,Great Travel Speakers,"I bought this product at LAX as I was leaving for a trip and love it - so much that I bought this one here on Amazon for my mom. It's a great travel speaker for your iPod, with a connector cord that plugs into where your headphones would normally connect in the iPod. Very compact and decent sound for the size and price. It's not meant to be a permanent speaker for your iPod, but would DEFINITELY recommend it for someone looking for a great travel speaker option. Requires 2 AAA batteries."
1,COBY CS-MP37 MP3 SPEAKER SYSTEM,"I ordered this product, and i guess i did not read it well. I thought i had ordered a player. I returned the product, and never got credit."
4,Worth reading for all small group participants...,"I started this book with rather low expectations, because of its very small size and the annoying fact that the author wrote a 5-star review of his own book!! I was very pleasantly surprised by the substantial content that was packed into this rather quick read. What makes this book somewhat unique is that it is written specifically to small group members, explaining the responsibility for them to fully invest in group life and casting vision for all that God intends to do in and through small groups. Most small group books are written for group leaders or church leaders, but this one is focused on helping people to become better group members. Neighbour covers a lot of ground in a small book, but it doesn't feel rushed. Though it is not mind-numbingly profound, it's a good read, one that I'm happy to recommend to anyone who wants to learn how they can grow as a small group member."
3,SIze Issue,It said an XL would fit.. Totally wrong. I got this for my wedding day and went commando instead cause seriously something like under not fitting shouldn't ruin the whole day. But now I'm stuck with a pair that I can't wear... *Sigh.
5,CLASSIC!,"This is amazing! I am just 13 but never before have i been so excited about a live album, with the classics being 'if i were a rich man', 'new world in the morning', 'elizabethan serenade', 'both sides now' and 'streets of London'"
3,Not bad,"This cd has many of Roger Whittaker's old standards that his fans are familiar with. It's interesting to hear the little introductions given to almost every song here; Mr. Whittaker comes off as a folk singer/raconteur of a kind seldom heard from today. So when he abruptly breaks into much more upbeat songs such as ""Hound Dog,"" it's very disconcerting.Other than that small complaint, the album is enjoyable with very few clunkers. A must have for even casual fans."

3,Nice CASE!!!,"The case is really nice, it really protects the phone from dirt and scratches, however, there are some flaws in its design such as it won't allow any accessories to be tied to the corner of the cell phone because the designed opened hole on the case sort of blocked the entry of any large object. Then there is the flaw of the open position of the battery chargers. The open spot is not really designed in the right angel or maybe it was just a little higher, but I can not get my battery charger plugged in without taking off the case.Other than the two flaws, the case is really nice!ps. i still don't think it's worth the price, but i was in a hurry so i didn't care as much."
5,Such a lovely story.....,It was such a touching story. It's about how Alan helps this disturbed girl who just came to america. She's been in a war and has seen many shocking sights. This book shows you what true friendship is. It was so cute. I even cried. It is one of those books you can never forget and can't put down until your done.
3,A GREAT Book,"Alan and Naomi is a great book. I recommend it to kids who are studying the Holocaust, because it shows you how some people were affected by the Holocaust. This book has wonderful characters and they are described in great detail. It also is a real page turner, because you are always wondering what is going to happen next. It has a very sad ending that is very dramatic. This book Alan and Naomi is a funny,sad and an exciting book, so I hope that you read it."
5,Read it over and over again!!!!!!!!!!!!!,i found this book to be one of the most amazing books ever written it shows the horrors this girl naomi went through. this book is a must read we have to get more people to read this before a terreble atrocity like the Holocaust happens again and so that we have more anti-Nazi groups
4,Stopped working pretty quickly,"At first, I thought this was a good heater, but it stopped working pretty soon after I installed it. The fan blows, but no hot air comes out - just like someone else' experience on these reviews.I'd give this 1 star, but the Amazon service won't let me change the 4 stars that I first gave it."
3,Okay but not great.,Controls are awkward. Fan doesn't push much air. Hard to mount. But it heats up the room and the remote and timer works.
3,OK For Price,"I have purchased 7 of these heaters over the past 9 months. We have already had to warranty 1 unit because the fan stopped working. The price is reasonable, and the remote control is good. The only upgrade that would make the heater a better unit is if it had a temperature controller in it. I think if they put a Temp control module in, where it would cycle on and off to keep a constant Temp in the room, then the fans wouldn't burn out so easily. According to quite a few of the other reviews, this seems to be a trend.. Maybe Soleus needs to look at some possible design upgrades, even if it costs a little more in the long run."
2,McFarlane's foray into the world of The Crow,"This book collects issues 7 - 10 and 4 of Todd McFarlane's short-lived Crow series. McFarlane bought the rights to the Crow, but the comic was cancelled after issue 10, because nobody really liked it. Jon J Muth does have a writing talent, unfortunately somebody made the mistake of trying to continue Eric Draven's story, rather than beginning anew.If you decide to buy this book, do so only for the art, and not for the storyline. It's a shame, considering the vast talents McFarlane has at his disposal"
5,This stuff works!,"My veterinarian recommended this for my labrador who swims daily. We have been using it religiously, every day, and so far no more yeast or bacterial infection and her ears smell great!"
2,Bait and switch.,"The movie is decent enough, but it's been out for a long time. They took Wings Hauser off of the advertising, which makes you think it's a different movie. So if you buy it thinking this, you simply get the old movie, in a new wrapper."
1,it sucks,"A complete waste of time. I thought I was getting ""forbidden world a.k.a mutant"" ,however, I was wrong. I still gave the movie a chance but a waste of time regardless."
4,Very good!,Bo hopkins was awesome I loved every minute of it! kind of dark but a definite must for any horror buffs collection......I loved the story and characters as well as the gore and suspense..........It never lost me!
2,"VERY DARK , BAD TRANSFER , MONO SOUND","A GOOD STORY WITH A VERY BAD DARK TRANSFER LOOKS LIKE OFF A VHSTAPE, DEFINITELY NOT A DIGITAL TRANSFER. STAY CLEAR OF THISDVD."
4,A less known classic for zombie fans!,"Zombie flicks have been my favorite movies ever since I saw ""Night of the Living Dead"" on Creature Features as a kid. Since then I've searched for other cool zombie flicks to see, like many other people have done. Well ""Mutant"" is one of those cool gems that has quiety slipped past people. I actually saw it the same day I saw ""Day of the Dead"" (one of my favorites) and still thought it was really good. The story takes a while to unfold but the pay off is sweet zombie action! For any fan of the zombie genre that hasn't seen ""Mutant"" do yourself a favor and buy this movie. It's worthy!"
3,A pleasant surprise.,"I was afraid this one's was gonna be some cheap garbage, but it wasn't as bad as I excpected. Some of the zombies looked a bit crappy but most of them work. And their abillity to melt things with their hands added some creepy moments to the film. The mutant transformations were spooky to. I like it when I see a movie that manages to create thrills and suspense without using buckeloads of gore. A lot of zombie movies tend to show a lot of guts beign torn out or necks chewed open. But this one has a more old-school feel to it and dosen't show to much graphic violence and tries to leave something for the viewers who can develop imaginations.So, I consider it a decent movie with ok effects and good actors."
3,"Not bad, but no Valiente","This is one of the very few Dunwich books that I would consider recommending. It does have useful information, and can be helpful to someone starting out and struggling with terms found in other material. However, I would definitely rate it lower than a similar work by Doreen Valiente, ""An ABC of Witchcraft Past and Present."""
2,Not very much needed!,"Gerina Dunwich's book Wicca A-Z is a well, just a plain book that makes the religion of wicca even more hyped up. Books like these make Wicca the religion seem well stupid instead of special which it really is. This book lists many things but still not quite worth the cover price."
4,Old Brown Suitcase,"WOW! what an amazing book. I am only 14, so it is rare that a book captures my attention. Slava, the main character in the novel, is my age. I understand some of the things she goes through. I reccomend it to anyone. Age 11-111. So READ IT and enjoy ;) thanks"
5,Tarheel54,"This volume fitted in very well with my three volume history of FDR by Schlesinger and Davis' first volume ""FDR Into the Strom: 1937- 1940."" The details of the conferences between FDR and Churchill added greatly to my understanding of those difficult years I was able to view only through the newspapers. As usual, Davis' prose was easy to read and yet not skimpy on important details. The role Hopkins played as Roosevelt's ""errand boy"" emerges more clearly in this account than in any of the other accounts I have read."
2,FDR end of the story,"FDR did wonderful things for this country and he fought his party and other countries to do what needed to be done. This book tells the story of his end, but the reading is slow and dull."
3,Hmmm,"I purchased this book in the hopes of finding insight into FDR's disability. This huge volume discusses everything and includes about one page total (if that) about it, providing a look into how FDR did and did not discuss his disability. Interesting how the history books and buffs don't talk about it much, but disappointing also so I only gave it 3. If you're a history buff and reading it to find out about the politics of the day and such, you would like it more."
1,Worse biography of anyone ever,"Is Robert Clouse capable of writing above the 8th grade level? After reading ""The Making of Enter the Dragon"" and then the first two-thirds of this one (I couldn't take anymore) I have my doubts.He isn't a bad director. He IS a bad writer, unless he is a master sandbagger.I have been a Bruce Lee fan for more than 20 years so I naturally thought I would love this book. I didn't. It was one of the few books that I was unable to finish. After 125 pages, I just couldn't bear to have my intelligence insulted any longer. Neither will you.Buy this for your 12 year old nephew who watches Kung Fu theatre and who takes Tae Kwon Do lessons at the YMCA. He will love it."
4,Excellent primer on UI design for the development team shelf,"McKay's book does an excellent job of introducing the first principles of UI design to a development audience. While there are many good books about interface design on the market, most are written by UI designers, for UI designers. This book is written by a developer for developers. If placed near the right development cubicles and read, this book should do a good job of making developers understand that interface design is a science, and not just common sense.The largest problem with this book is theoretical, on the topic of affordances. The author has adopted Norman's 1986 position on affordances wholesale, when this position is a misconstrual of the original concept posed by J.J. Gibson. Still, this theoretical problem does not have a large impact on the sound, practical advice offered in this volume."
4,Arrived quickly and in good condition,The book was as described with the CD and in good condition. I arrived in a reasonable amount of time.
2,"Good content, shame about the interface","Mr McKay knows his subject and could have written an attractive slim volume. As it is, he has given us a fat ugly one. Ironically, the worst aspect of this book is its UI and for exactly the reasons that the author is at pains to explain. The giant headings are distracting, the over printed chapter numbers, just silly, etc. To compound the irksome UI, the author insists on recycling every sentence he has written over and over again - this undoubtedly bulks out the book, but it does nothing for this user's experience."
5,An Excellent UI Book.,"Developing User Interfaces for Windows should be within reach of every Windows developer who will have some UI developing to do. Along with the Windows User Experience, also from Microsoft Press, this book is an invaluable aid.Each chapter is short and precise, but, avoiding any cliché's, explains the Windows UI and developing for it in great details. The Book is relatively long, but it needs to be in order to cover in detail the task of developing Windows UI applications, which it does well.The book is slightly geared towards 'C' developers, but I am a VB developer and find it easy to convert and 'C' idioms into VB. The book is in a real-world 'hands-on' style. Not too much theory and analysis exists (unlike other books on UI design), which lends it to being excellent both for reading and for reference afterwards.I Highly recommend this book."
4,"Very useful, comprehensive, referential","This is a good book. It is long, but so are most comprehensive books and the style is conversational and easy to read. The chapters are independent, so readers can read just the parts they are interested in.The book covers just about every aspect of a gui including design and testing and is full of practical advice.I am using a very useful section entitled 'Sample User Interface Guidelines' as a checklist for testing gui's. And, of course, I keep it nearby as a handy reference."
4,the best music of 2000,It was a good c.d. when I had bought I did nit know the songs but now I have ordered it. It is a good c.d. to listen. If you like pop then get thisc.d.
5,Good price for great quality,"I was very happy to find a set of the table mate with the rack for $99 including shipping. The table mates are wonderful. They slide almost effortlessly across carpet, they are strong and easy to clean. And best of all they slide under your furniture so that you can bring the table right into your lap. They fold up easy and are great for laptop use."
4,Tablemate quality control,Good product however one of the four tables was defective. The two legs that are perpendicular to the floor have a hole drilled on the inside edge of each leg where you insert the U shaped bracket that supports the table in a level position. Three trays were correctly drilled. However one tray had a hole drilled in one leg but lacked the necessary matching hole in the other leg. So only three of our trays are useable. Better quality control at the factory is needed.Table-Mate II 4-Pack Folding Table with Storage Rack
5,table mate II 4 pack,"I had 3 of the originals but they were getting worn out. Shopped every where and finally found then on Amazon. Price was right and they are everything I expected , Big improvementjimc"
4,Table Mate 4 Pack,"Excellent quality. Somewhat difficult to use at first until you have some practice. Sturdy,easy to clean,stores nicely. Would buy again no problem."
2,Big disappointment!,"I purchased this phone after reading all the great reviews. Boy am I disappointed. The reception on this phone is terrible, the signal bars are misleading, calls are often dropped when 4 bars appear. The main reason I purchased this phone is for better reception and that is also the reason I will be returning it. A slick phone is useless without reception."
3,Great phone..... Terrible service.,I've had this phone for about three months now. The phone itself is great. The options are all there.. lots of fun. The service on the other hand is horrible. I can't even use it inside my house or the call gets dropped.I'm debating buying out of my contract to go back to my AT&T wireless service which was great. Too bad this phone isn't offered through that company.
1,What a waste of money.,"Got this phone late November, and the screen went out 2 days later. Sprint replaced with a new one. The second phone they gave me would not store numbers. When I tried it would shut down and start up again. Got my money back. I'll wait for something new from Samsung!"
2,Worst Reception Ever,"I got this phone 3 weeks ago and I am already returning it. It had the worst reception from all the phones I've had. I live about a mile from a Sprint tower and calls are dropped all the time. My wife has a Samsung i-500 and that phone never drops a call in the house.I tried going on the web on both phones at the same time, her phone worked without any problems. My phone did not even connect.I've tried the web access and tried making calls from many different places and most of the time it just does not work. Last week I spent 20 minutes trying to make a call. Twice it went through just to be dropped within seconds. The phone showed a strong signal, then it dropped a few bars, then back up, etc. I never had these problems on the same area with my 3.5 years old Motorola Timeport.Also, the camera quality is nowhere near all it's hyped up to be."
1,Not Worth It!,"The phone has a ton of features and if it worked as it is supposed to, it would be a great phone. I was pulled in by the blue color. However, the phone has major power issues. My first one kept losing power and cutting off as if the battery had been disconnected. The second, a refurbished replacement, would not take a charge...so after two days with that one, I'm off to get a third one. There are cheaper phones that are much more reliable, and that you will be more satisfied with."
1,"Sorry Sanyo, your VM4500 needs a new mic. & ringer tones.",I have to agree with the Sprint employee that posted a review on here. This phone has the coolest look but when it comes to its microphone and ringer tone selection it just plain SUCKS! People tell me my voice sound pretty bad and when i get closer to the mic. they say I sound like im hyperventalating. Also there is not one ring tone I like. I guess Sayno/Sprint wants us to pay and download the nice tones which im not going to do. To top is off Sprint charges its customers $15.00 a month to use the walkie talkie feature! Im returing this phone tommarow because I hate it. And im never going to get a Sanyo Cell again!
2,Don't buy!,"This phone is flashy and has some fun features, however I don't feel that it is worth the materials that it is made from! Sprint has a great eye for new technology, yet they never seem to know how to use it properly. I can never seem to get a signal now that I have purchased this phone, and either the ""network"" or phone is constantly malfunctioning. I'm already on my second phone due to manufacturer faults and would not recommend it to anyone!"
1,Anyone else have power problems.,I picked this phone up when it first came out. I have had nothing but problems with the battery. Now dont get me wrong with a fully charged battery this phone is excellent. But dont expect your blissfull feelings to last very long because very quickly it will no longer take a charge. I come back now to see it was discontinued. Lame. Oh
1,MK Diamons 1 1/2 hp diamond saw,"This saw at first glace looks like it is going to be perfect for what I needed. It was light weight and could cut 20"" tiles. Until I actually found out if you wanted to cut them in half, it didn't quite do it and the table just wasn't quite big enough to hold the tiles. I had to have a helper help hold them. No problem I moved on and started to cut. The saw was quiet and smooth everything was going well, then the tray wouldn't slide. It started to get caught up on something. I tried a couple of different lubricants none that would do the job, finally I found that lithium grease was the best thing for it. The next problem that I had is it started to get loader, the noise was almost unbearable. Then it would cut out like a power surge. Then it just gave it up and the motor stopped and smoke came a rolling out of the motor. I made about 10 to 15 cuts with the saw and that was it. In my review this is not a good saw."
3,"Great concept, so so delivery","First here is what you get:One CD and one small booklet.the course covers:1. Guide to pronunciation2. The 5 tones, the vowels, and the consonants3. Clusters, confusing words, poly-syllabic words4. Thai intonation5. Tongue twisters6. ThaiglishThis is a mixture of new material and material available in other programs by Poomsan Becker. It was a great idea and a very tough task to go after. It falls short of my expectations. First the material seems a little skimpy and at times goes too fast. There could have been more exercises. Also sometimes it is hard to follow along with the reading material. You have the English, the Thai phonetic and then the written Thai. It is very easy to lose your place and then the audio beats you to the punch.I have mixed feelings about recommending this product or telling people to stay away. It may help but it is no miracle worker by far."
4,Glad I found one.,Great price for this pump motor. Eclipse 2 hood is no longer being made and I had a hard time finding one. Amazon pulls through again and for cheaper than any other site.
1,Don't bother. It's biased and negative.,Larson's christian viewpoint blinds his skimpy coverage of the various religions/cults. He is quick to point out the negative aspects (often in a demeaning fashion) and fails to find any redeeming qualities in anything but his ONE TRUE RELIGION ie the christian cult. What could have been interesting turns out to be a pep rally for christianity. A waste of time.
4,Though-provoking collection of experiences of real people,"The pace and pressures of the business world have done nothing but accelerate in recent years. Not everyone finds wholehearted focus on business to the exclusion of everything else to be the personal ideal. This book describes the experiences of seven real people who started out on the fastest of tracks, and yet were not truly happy. The process they went though examining their lives, and the sometimes drastic steps they took to redefine themselves are fascinating, and very human, reading. Everyone at some time has reason to question their direction. Many people will find someone to identify with and solutions they had not considered. This is a meaningful book on coping with the fast-paced life of today, written by an author whose career is based on helping motivate business people. He fully shares his expertise with the reader. Full disclosure: I am the author's older brother and very much settled in on the fast track!"
2,Hi Speed 4 Port USB Hub 4 Port USB 2.0 Hub,I am not happy with this product. It seems like my computer does not have enough power to run the items plugged into the hub. The hub does have a spot for power adapter but is not included. I did not see anything telling me what power adapter I would need to buy or where I could buy it. Other then those problems the hub does have a long cord attached that allows you to put it almost anywhere you need it.
3,"Works ok, but there's a catch","Once I opened it I found out that it needed an ""optional"" (that means not included) adapter for use with cameras, printers, etc. I just switched a couple of cables around, and it works fine with my mouse and graphics tablet."
5,HiSpeed USB Port expander,"This was an inexpensive and terrific add-on for my older PC. I had only 2 USB ports in the back that were hard to reach and I was having to swap out all my various USB devices. Now I have the hub on the corner of my desk so it's very accessable. I have 1 caution however, because the hub uses 1 USB port to connect, I had a net gain of 3 ports which are already filled. So, you may want to consider a hub with more than 4 ports if you connect a mouse, keyboard, camera, external hard-drive, IPod, printer(s) etc."
2,Don't be fooled by other reviews!,"I was lured by the 5 star reviews from the other readers. But this story is sooo boring. I hate the TSTL, helpless, naive heroines. I know this was written in the 1980's, but come on! This girl is a complete doormat who doesn't stand up for herself or her love at any point in entire book. The hero treats her like a child, and frankly, she deserves it. She's supposedly a peace lover, while he's a violent pirate, but as soon as they start sleeping together, she just caves in. And the Big Misunderstanding keeps happening over and over and over... I kept reading in the vain hope that at some point he grovels for the stuff he does or she finally grows a pair but it never happens. I wish I got those couple of hours of my life back...."
5,"A unique, powerful and gentle book","Wisdom of the Mythtellers is one of the few books that changed the way I view the world and my place in it -- for the better.This is an exploration of the myths and cultures of living hunter/gatherer societies. It is not a rehash of the mythology you learned in ninth grade English class.Sean Kane supports his assertions with ample evidence from many cultures, living and ancient, and presents them with poetic grace and gentle humor."
3,Poor choice of binding,"While this book is a bit beyond my current playing level, hopefully I'll be able to make use of it in the future. So while I can't comment on its usefulness yet, its obvious shortcoming is the way it's bound. Any book containing sheet music should be in a binding that stays open on a music rack. How a publisher could overlook this fact is beyond me."
2,more help for me!,This book was not that helpful to me! I wanted more info on riffs peculiar to the B3 as well as more info on technical styles of playing. It was helpful with the drawbars.
4,One of the few Hammond methods around,"I thought there were no Hammond methods, but somehow I found this one, and it's a good starting point for neophytes of the B-3 and drawbar organs. Don't expect it to disclose all the techniques you heard on Jimmy Smith's records, but it can be really useful as a reference book. The addition of the CD is absolutely essential: a good feature from the author.It's a fairly good catalogue of riffs, although I wish it focused a lot more on funk and jazzy riffs (there are some good examples, however -but not enough nor representative) than on poppy ballads and clichés.Anyway,at least it can lend some help to us forgotten organists and lovers of the Hammond!"
5,Great Book,Great book. The excercises are all good to know techniques across multiple syles. Very solid voicings and good explanations. This book will keep me busy for awhile.
2,"Great item, if not for major electrical interference","I discovered that the Soleus MS-10r causes severe line voltage interference when the heat is set to the LOW setting. When set to LOW, I have, so far, found that this unit causes these following items to emit a loud humming noise from their tranformer: A computer UPS, a CD player and a stereo amplifier.Buyer beware!!! Even if the appliances in your household emit no hum noise, I'm certain that this much amount of line interference can't be great towards the long term reliability of sensitive electronic items!This is the first item I've ever owned that does this and I am a gadget freak. How in the world did UL ever put their stamp of approval on this product!"
4,"a warm sun like, enegy saving heater","I waited to write this review since I did not get my bill for electricity till now. It is really energy efficient. I only spent 12 dollars more a month after I started using this heater. Like other people who wrote reviews, a high power(800W) was too bright and too hot to be around the heater. But a lower power was nice and cozy. It gives me a positive energy and warmth. I use this heater instead of a night lamp for readings. Also, it is very safe so I can use it around my 2 yrs old."
3,Soleus Air Reflective Heater MS-10R,"The Soleus Air reflective heater is a good product overall. It does a very good job compared to heaters of higher wattage that cost more to operate. I like being able to select between it's two heat settings, high and low, and the adjustable timer which is a real energy saver and safety feature. The oscillation feature enables the Soleus Air MS-10R to heat a larger area which is nice also. Its great for daytime use or wherever you don't mind a little extra light but the heating element gives off too much light for sleeping areas. Otherwise, I am well satisfied with this product."
3,Be Sure To Buy Some Sunglasses With It!,It is everything it says but if you have it oscolating in front of you it is like a spotlight! The Halogen reflects off of the parabolic dome and blinds you everytime it faces you. If you like it dark when you watch TV at night this is a very bright night light. If you're just going to put it in the corner and not have it face you it's a great heater. We returned it in spite of all of its other great features.if you want parablolic try the coil based heaters like Holmes or the Windchaser models. They are not as efficient but they aren't so bright either.
1,Not So Hot...,"The heater is good if you stay within 3' of the unit. After 4 hours, it did not heat a 10x12 room at all. It was 68 degrees before and 4 hours later it was 68.3. There is no blower, so don't let the fan-like style fool you. Also, I was amazed how much light is produced. Forget about this in a bedroom, it is like you are looking into the Sun on Miami beach. Perhaps in a very small environment like an office cube it would be ok, but the light would drive me crazy."
2,Great receiver until it failed,"This was the heart of my audio-video system for two or three years and I was very happy with it when it was working. Unfortunately one day it simply stopped outputting sound. No power surge, no abuse, didn't even touch it -- it just failed. It still powers on, but won't give me any sound. Not even with headphones.From a bit of web searching it looks like this is a common problem. I don't know about all of Onkyo but this receiver model is certainly not reliable. Not recommended."
3,"Some good ideas, but...","Phreeworld has done an admirable job of concentrating on song based progressive rock with minimal pyrotechnics and lots of attention to melodies, vocal harmonies, and arrangement. Very similiar qualities to early 80's Yes (pop music with interesting arrangements). However, the production tends make the music sound like big digital, over processed ""mush"" by the end of the disc (especially the guitars). Better production and judicial editting in the future would do this music justice."
4,Smileage,"I really enjoyed reading this book on travel games and activities. I wish my parents had this book when I was a child and often grew bored stiff on long car trips from Connecticut to Florida.Smileage contains great conversation starters, games, quizzes and ponderings for the prisoners of a car or other mode of transportation. I found the quality of these suggestions to be very good. Though the book touts itself as being ""for all ages,"" some of the activities are rather complex and certainly would not lend themselves to toddlers for example. I think that that majority of the activities would be most appropriate for school-age children and older.I give Smileage four stars for originality, creativity, and overall travel fun! In fact, some of the conversation starters could be good in general to increase communication,closeness and interaction with your kids."
3,Aleksey Budovsky,"The two animations on this DVD by Aleksey (Alex) Budovsky are weird and wonderful, and not to be missed. They are both videos for weird and wonderful songs by ""The (Real) Tuesday Weld"". As far as I can tell, this is the only DVD with any of Budovsky's animation. He has a few more on his website (Figli-Migli Productions). The two Budovsky titles on this DVD are ""Bathtime in Clerkenwell"" and ""Terminally Ambivalent Over You"".The two Plympton titles are old favorites, and there are a couple other good titles on this disk. The rest ranges from forgettable to unwatchable.I very highly recommend the Budovsky titles to anyone who loves weird and wonderful animation. But plan on skipping through most of the other titles on this disk."
3,classic movie,Funny movie clasic stuff. This is a must have if you like classic movies. I haven't watched kidnapping the president but deathrow gameshow is definetly work having.
5,It was an enthralling book.,"I just read Five Were Missing, and I liked it very much. It was enjoyable, and I couldn't put it down. Great Book!"
3,review of book that never came,"I'm sure this would be a fascinating book on western art if it ever arrives It was ordered on Jan. 21, today is Feb 23 I sure hope it gets there before my daughter graduates from school."
4,Excellent book,Excellent textbook. Full of quality photos of the art in focus. The information is in great quality and to the point.
3,am i on Satan drugs?!?,"unlike the other reviewers, i thought Satan's Slave was really great and Terror was really bad.Terror was boring, cliched, and not exploitative at all.Satan's Slave however, was weird, dark, compelling, and included one hell of a hottie.individually, i would have given Terror 2 stars and Satan's Slave 4 stars. that's why the two together get 3.D"
4,Quality and Simplicity,"I've owned this mouse for a few years now, and have never had a problem with it. As some people said before, the scroll pad can be a bit strange at first, but it becomes second nature quickly. The software is excellent and works well. It lacks the myriad of buttons that new mouses have, but in the same sense, it's also quite simple to set up and use."
4,Cool mouse,"Great mouse, great look. Takes some getting used to if you are accustomed to using the scrolling wheel, but once you get used to it, its cool."
5,A great ideal is described in a very easy language!,"One of my very favorite books. It is very easy to understand, and the described philosophie is great. No question is unanswered. READ THIS BOOK!!! *****"
1,Took to long,I ordered the CD on December 4 and did not receive it until December 23. It was a Christmas CD and I did not have it in time to enjoy it.
1,there is a package issue with this,ordered 2 times and both time got a sctached dvd just got a refund and they really need to get the package corrected so the dvd dont fly around in the box
5,A treasure every household needs NOW!,"Brent has captured the wisdom for our time! This is a book that all human beings need to read, practice and hold themselves accountable.If we all dreamed as powerfully as Brent and moved into action sharing ourselves as he does, then we would be living our dreams and not dying as a society.Great gift for all those that you care about and some of those that you don't!"
5,A Beautifully Written Book,This book is written with great wisdom and clarity. The cover entice one to read and envision life as beautiful. As a minister I will use this book along with my bible in discussion groups. As well as practice the easy recipes for life.Reverend Wennye' Edwards
5,Rainbow Bridge,Lovely book. Great reminders of all facets of life and spirituality. Worth having and sharing.
4,Very useful.,"As stated in the brief review above, this is a book about powers inherent in us all. If you would like to investigate one of the original sources for ""your thoughts create your reality"" it is here. Personally, I found the writings of The Mother more down to earth and understandable. Often, she is explaining the teachings of Sri Aurobindo. Recommended."
5,"Insightful, Hopeful","Wisdom such as this from Aurobindo will, hopefully, evolve into qualities every human being are born into, along with the gratitude and humility to honor them."
2,not what i expected,"i was expecting more deep contents in this book, but it turned out not. there is couple of chapters were useful, but i didnt find it a book that teachs something. its more like opinions. its only useful for novices."
2,I can't recommend this tape.,"The production values are not that great and it seems very impersonal. Moves very slow by showing 2 or 3 or 4 angles of the same routine before moving on to the next section. I just can't really relate very well to this tape and I wish I'd sent it back. I might go back to it to learn a few new steps, but I just don't look forward to learning from it."
2,Not worth the time,"An interesting subject, to me, and this book does cover some issues that were relevant in 1993. However, the author seems to lack a solid foundation in the subject he discusses. A mistake was made in the description of how options work. Claims that the electronic economy has destabilized the world's markets are made but essentially not backed up. Probably not worth the time to read, unless you have a lot of spare time."
3,An okay guide,"I found this book limited in scope and recommendations, especially for the price. We hiked the volcano which the author said was not too strenuous as long as you are in decent shape. My husband and I thought we were not going to make it to the top and we are both in very good shape and in our early 30s. I question whether the author has ever climbed it in snow boots, or climbed it at all. Lonely planet is better."
2,"two stars for the blast from the past,but this is not a cartoon just drawings and voices","i remember watching this as a kid and likeing it even though it really isn't a cartoon. the drawings are good but there is almost zero budget from the look of things,and even my boys wouldn't watch this because of the lack of action."
2,poor vision,The music on this video is very nice but it is ninety minutes of video positioned in one spot. The colors are dull and on my big screen rather blurry. The credits are blurry too. Reproduced poorly? I like the idea but might try a clearer version.
3,A decent workbook to accompany a bad textbook,"Although this workbook wasn't the best I have ever encountered, it was sufficient in helping to understand the language. At the beginning of each chapter there are summaries and sometimes helpful charts for students to refer back to while doing the exercises. Many of these summaries were very useful because the textbook was often confusing and unorganized. The textbook also didn't usually give many examples of how to approach the new information. I would strongly recommend this workbook to anyone who is buying the accompanying textbook. However, my overall recommendation would be not to buy this set at all."
5,A good read,"I started this book right after finishing ""The Ponds of Kalambayi"" and I didn't think it was going to be as good. But as the book progressed it got better and better. Very descriptive and informative. I got a real sense of what the author's two years must of been like. A good read for anyone interested in the Peace Corps."
3,"Well written, but boring at times","Sarah, the author, spends two years as a Peace Corps volunteer trying to educate the people of Nambonkaha on health and medicine. This book is the story of her time spent there and the lives of the friends she made during her stay.The story was well written and the characters were fun. The book definitely doesn't read as fiction. It's a true account of the life in this African village. This might be why I had such a hard time getting into this book. If it had been told more in story form or had a beginning and end I might not have gotten bogged down. As it was, it was over 300 pages of things the author notices about the village and it's inhabitants. My guess is this would be an amazing book for those who enjoy true stories and history. I just couldn't get into it myself."
5,One of my favorite travel memoirs,"Erdman relates the stories of the two years she spent as a Peace Corps volunteer in a small village in the Ivory Coast in Africa in the late 1990's.I had to look up the copyright date after I started the book; was the book taking place in the 1990's or the 1890's? It could have been either based on the lives of the villagers. No running water, no electricity. Mothers didn't know the birthdates or even the ages of their children. Very little reading or writing. No knowledge of birth control or ways to combat disease. Little knowledge of the outside world.Where should Erdman, assigned to the little village as a health care worker, start?She begins to teach the mothers about their babies, how to help them gain weight, getting them immunized, and gradually begins to help them learn about ways to avoid getting AIDS and about birth control. In the end, she feels a deep sense of accomplishment in her work in the village.My new favorite travel story."
5,This book saved my marriage!,This is the best book I've ever read on marriage. The author has a powerful annointing from God to minister to married women.I was truly changed after reading this book. I highly reccommend it. Buy one for you and a friend!
1,Doesn't hold charge,"I purchased this flashlight about six months ago from another vendor. Originally, it did hold a charge; now after cranking for more than two minutes it won't. In order to get light, I have to crank constantly--it does not illuminate without cranking."
4,"Soft and sturdy ""Green"" Leash",The color is vibrant and the fleece lined handle is soft and comfortable to hold. The only thing this leash is missing is hardware that allows for shortening and lengthening. Great product - good price!!
1,Broke within a few months,"Super disappointed. I purchased the leash and harness in November and the clasp that hooks onto the collar broke within three months. I love the fleece lining but won't be purchasing another. My previous leash (which I had to go back to) has lasted four years, and counting. Hopefully it was just a product malfunction specific to mine, but I cannot recommend this product."
3,"Gotta agree with others, the spring on the leash needs fixing","I've ordered a few of these, one i got a tight spring for the clasp, and the other was much looser. My puppy was able to escape the loose leash a few times. I sent the looser one back and got the same type with the replacement. I like planet dog and their products, but they need to get their leash spring issue fixed. Im not the first person to write this type of review. I like the leash, but i will look elsewhere for the next."
2,SMELLS WHEN WET,I found out this leash smells really bad after it gets wet. it smells worse than my dog even after i washed it before. my dog does not chew on leashes but after minor dragging around for 2 years it is frayed all over the place and needs to be replaced now. it is comfortable to hold and definitely strong enough. but i definitely won't buy this again.
2,BROKE AFTER 1 1/2 MONTHS,"This leash may look nice and all with the hemp nicely sown fleece handle but ive soon to realize this leash is NOT GOOD AT ALL IF YOUR PUP IS A PULLER and is STRONG.I have a 5 month old Welsh Corgi tonight i took him out to go potty before bed and right as i put it on him he sprinted to his tree and the hook just fell apart, and after a good 2 minutes of bribing him while he is running around in circles with a dried liver he came. When i took a close look at the hook it was all rusty inside of it (SIGH).LOOKS LIKE IM BACK TO buying PETCO LEASHES FOR NOW. I give this a two stars only because it was barley damaged from my pups chewing."
1,Defective product,"I purchased the leash and harness back in Nov 2011. Last week, the metal clasp/hook of the leash that hooks to the harness literally just broke apart to pieces while I was walking my dog. No, I do not have a 100lb dog who likes to drag me around. I have a 22 lb Bichon who is blind. I love the softness of the hemp but cannot trust this product based on my experience. Seemed like a good product based on the positive reviews but I am now noticing that all the negative reviews are about this exact same issue. Clearly a defective batch in the mix or time will tell. I want a refund or at least a replacement."
5,Awesome!,"I have the cutest leash and harness! Bridget is so proud and loves showing off this adora-bull set! It washes well and is really sturdy. The fleece lining keeps it nice & soft and the hardware is heavy duty. We got the green, it looks so cute & is environmentally friendly! WOO HOO!"
1,Serious Defect in Leash,"We received our first Planet Dog collar and leash last week. We took our pugs to the park. We were less than six feet from the car when the hook just fell to pieces and our little Molly was loose. Happily she did come to us when we called and we were able to tie the leash onto her collar (not what one expects to have to do with a brand new leash). I view this as a very serious defect. Had we walked straight from our house, which we often do, our pug would have been loose on a very busy road. I would never recommend this to anyone. The hook was all rusty inside. There needs to be some serious quality control/safety checks."
1,Hemp great - too bad the snap won't hold it onto the collar,"The hemp leash material is far better than nylon - no ""rope burn"". Also nice and thick making it easier to hold onto. Unfortunately, the snap leaves you holding onto a lovely leash while your dog runs off. It's not an isolated problem either. I re-ordered 3 times and the snaps were always junk. Too bad the snap quality doesn't live up to the rest of the product."
4,Best leash so far... wish it held up!,"I love this leash. There are only 2 issues that I have with it. The seams came apart and the metal latch is low quality. The material is strong and customer service is great, but the stichimg could be better and the company could use a more reliable latch."
2,Chuck Palahniuk?,"It may have been Lance Olsen's words, but it was Chuck Palahniuk's voice. If you love Chuck P., can tolerate one sentence paragraphs and the always irritating second person narration, then I'm sure you'll like this.Just a matter of taste. It wasn't my cup of tea."
2,Careless with facts,"On p. 170, the author claims that Shoeless Joe Jackson got his nickname when he arrived in Philadelphia barefoot after a train ride from his South Carolina home. In fact, however, he earned this nickname after he played a minor league game in his socks because a new pair of spiked baseball shoes gave him blisters the day before. I'm skeptical of a book that misses such an extraordinary fact as this."
3,Required for class,This book was required reading by a professor. His superior intellect decided this was a good book so I am compelled to agree... even if I didn't read it.
3,Alton Miller - Stories In Bohemia,"Classic deep house -- recalling the glory days of Chicago -- on Alton Miller's STORIES FROM BOHEMIA. It's all smooth with soul to spare. ""Centre of the Sun,"" for instance, is so slick that you almost don't realize that it's been going on for ten minutes. ""No Goodbyes,"" on the other hand, is immediately dreamy and slower, but wears thin (as does ""Idiofrequencies""). But ""We Are Beautiful"" has a downtempo vibe as well, with the vocals carry it through, and ""Slow Burn"" carries through on its name beautifully. The last two tracks bring things back uptempo, and they glisten with all the reasons why we started listening to house in the first place."
2,I love las ardillitas,"This is not a christmas CD!Pense que tendria mas canciones de navidad pero solo tiene 2, no se porque lo titularon Navidad!"
5,"A very good read, but not a light one","I read Kathryn Harrison when I'm feeling dark and moody. Her excellent books, including ""Thicker Than Water,"" tend to deal mainly with familial relationships that are anything but picture-perfect. I would not recommned her work if you're just looking to kill time with a light-hearted read, but, if you want something that will haunt you, and maybe even make you think a little, pick her stuff up. She's worth it."
1,To much of a muchness,"I have not read any others of Kathryn Harrison's books. After reading this one, I think I probably won't try other books of hers either.To me, the book is overwrought, both in the writing and (as another reviewer noted) and in the repetitiousness of its main character's expressions of emotions. A good editing job might have helped.I know about the sad true-life situation which prompted Harrison to write ""The Kiss."" However, in this novel, the author seems to be recapitulating the incest with the father, but here it seems too calculated to move its readers.The whole novel seems calculated, I guess I would venture to say."
3,Thicker Than Water review,I felt like I was reading a bio! Well written but much angst. The girl subject was confronted with all the things girls should not be confronted with...almost a manual for how NOT to raise a child! No real resolution at the end and that's realistic.
4,The Modern Fransiscans,"Easily and quickly readable with some interesting meat in each chapter. Does not dwell much on ""mythology of the saints"" as does some older books on the Fransiscan movement. Adds some interesting historical sources for Fransiscan theology such as John Duns Scotus."
1,Product is great but not with this seller,Product is great but will think twice before placing order with Vitamin Shoppe again. They claim they never received the order from Amazon.com and offer no further help. Have to cancel the order with Amazon.com representative after waiting for my shipment for more than 2 weeks.
2,Can Charlie Chan find the clue?,"Sidney Toler, Benson Fong and Mantan Moreland return.A frightened man, Rausch (Charles Wagenheim), hides in a car to get away from some goons. He finally makes it to his boat, but a mysterious person is hiding in the same darkened room. Charlie Chan arrives on the scene and meets with Captain Flynn (Robert Homans). They have to arrest Rausch, but then they decide to keep him safe. They both go down to the boat. They find Rausch dead. he was stabbed.Charlie Chan must solve the case. Son #3 Tommy helps his father.Also in the cast: Virginia Brissac, Ben Carter, Jack Norton, Janet Shaw, Helen Deverell, Victoria Faust.Running Time: 64 minutes.Sidney Toler in his 16th appearance as ""Charlie Chan"".Next Mystery:Charlie Chan in The Shanghai Cobra(1945)."
1,Terrible,I never received this item. I received another item and I returned it promptly. Nothing zero ... I am greatly disappointed.
4,Big Assist From Manton Moreland,THE SCARLET CLUE is an above average entry in the Chan series helped by a fast-paced script and the antics of Manton Moreland as Birmingham Brown.Charlie is acting as a federal agent trying to solve a murder and at the same time prevent the theft of top secret radar plans. The title refers to a bloody footprint.Sidney Toler has the role of Charlie and Benson Fong is back as Tommie Chan.
3,One of the best Monogram Chan entries.,"If you have not sampled one of the Monogram Chan movies yet, The Scarlet Clue would be a good one to start with. It takes place in a radio and television studio with many sinister electronic devices. Birmingham has some very funny material, including finding his own face in a police mug book as he and Tommy Chan look for suspects. Near the end of the film, Chan makes an obvious error in judgement that the real Chan would never make. Can you tell what it is? Famous Chan line is ""So many fish in fish market, even flower smell same."""
5,A Favorite Soc Textbook,"I had to purchase this book for class and it's become one of my favorite textbooks thus far. Kerbo is clearly biased, however he does present different and conflicting theories, and criticisms of said theories, to every issue explored in the book - and there's a LOT packed in. I think he did a very good job of attempting to tackle so much and focus on areas with the most study done on them. He also makes it clear that more research needs to be done as we are far from finding all the answers.As for readability, there are a few chapters that are extremely dry - lots of numeral figures to illustrate his points. However, the entire book is extremely eye-opening and there are many useful graphs and charts to help present the data."
3,Hard to read,"Using the text currently for a sociology class which is a 200 level class. This text is very hard to understand for someone who is newly introduced to sociology or possibly anyone who is not specifically specialized in this subject. I have found that i need a dictionary on hand every time i read and even then, i typically do not understand what is being said. Some of the chapters are dry, some are actually interesting when understood. Also, uses alot of graphs and numerical reports in order to back his statements which can be useful"
2,Super Biased.,I am currently taking a Soc class and we are using this book. It is super biased already and I am only on the 2nd chapter. If I can tell that it is biased then it really is. I don't care about politics but I feel a book to be used in a class passed off as a textbook should be relatively neutral. I want to read both sides of the story and decide things for myself.
1,This textbook was completely androcentric.,"Do not buy this book. Do not read this book. Instead, e-mail Harold R. Kerbo and tell him that women's place in social stratification deserves a little more than a few pages. Remind him that women are 50% of the United States population, and thus 50% of the United States Social Stratification system."
5,"rush around and not just race, but go and get cops on your but","Dude, get this! The soundtracks are awsome and you don't just race, you also can just go around the city and get the cops hot on you. This is my favorite game and if you like cops to get on your but, then this is the game to play. What happens is you have a big party with hooters and all of your cars get stolen. Race and get your stuff back."
1,Don't Buy A Game With Music By Skinny Puppy,The soundtrack to this game contains Skinny Puppy. This band had a stage show in 2004 where they did a mock assassination of the president and did a mock beheading with people wearing terrorist suits. After they do the beheading they take off their masks and reveal themselves as Bush and Cheney. Please send a message to these videogame companies that you will not buy a product that promotes a band that takes part in this type of behavior.
2,Its an ok rental,"The game is fun to rent, but i dont recomend buying it.They did some cool things with it though...its the first time i got to see a saleen S7, Dodge Magnum, and some other nice cars in a game. (although i have yet to unlock them because the game gets pretty hard at times). But the game lacks some stuff (no real customization is a major issue)... But its a fun rental if you like cars and want to unlock cars.I enhjoyed renting it (i have the hollywood video MVP game card so i can rent it as long as i want)i recomend renting before you buy.oh, and who cares what a great band like skinny puppy did in their free time...they have nothing to do with this game except for lending a good song to it."
1,Please bring back battle mode!!!!!,"If any one else has played SF 2049 on the dreamcast, you know battle mode was fun as hell!! This is a let down that they did not add it, LA Rush is a HUGE let down overall...Please someone remake a San Fran Rush game with Battle Mode!!!!"
4,"Good mix, original artists","Just for the record, the pre-purchase clips online and the MP3s I just purchased are all by the original artists.I wanted to buy one of the songs and found this compilation with a bunch of songs I liked, so I ended up buying the whole thing. Good listening!"
4,Home recording studio,"I ues this software soley for recording my guitar licks via Line6 Guitar Port. I bought a tascam dp-01 digital recorder for $300 and now it is collecting dust. This software was low price (...)When I have a guitar lick or idea, I simply plug in and record. I only have to play the lick once, and I can loop it over and over again. I have recorded 2 demo albums already. For the price, this is a steal!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Pro-LIKE,"This is a cool piece of software for what it does and the price point but, anything that says on the box it only requires a ""Windows-compatible sound card"" with no mention of ASIO is only going to go so far. I wish there was a sub-100 dollar solution for true professional multitrack recording but, this won't do it. It can do a lot of great things real easy and spits out a nice result but, at the end of the ""play-date"" remember to reload your Cubase SX or Protools and get back to real work."
4,NEED EXPIRATION DATES ON THE PRODUCT,everything was good - the cookies were excellent BUT I had NO visibility to the expiration date BEFORE I ordered - I just took a calculated risk and would prefer that Amazon displays this information somehow to help customers make a qualified decision...
4,wheat free-dairy free,"if you want to eat healthy this product is an excellent choice. I have programmed myself not to eat junk for snacks, instead, i eat one or two of these nutritional oatmeal raisin cookies with a cup-of-joe and i'm satisfied. You will enjoy this cookies as i have and will want more."
5,Amazing little cookies...,"These are amazingly delicious little organic cookies that have a nice crunch to them, and a subtle buttery flavor mixed in with the chocolate chips. These are seriously some of the best cookies I've ever had.These are much cheaper to order here for me than get at the store. I have, however, gotten one slightly ""burnt"" or overcooked batch. The color of the cookies should match that of the bag image, but one batch all the cookies were browner and had a slightly burnt taste to them."
1,A total waste!,"A sorry excuse for a ""state of the art"" racing game: the camera jerks, it's slow, and the max speed is 15 mph. I can't even tell when to switch to 3rd gear because it displays your speed on a green bar, not telling you how fast you are going. Even if you decide to make your own track, it is so hard to do, it isn't even worth it. I just hope the 2000 version is better. Don't even bother taking out your checkbook; just move right along to the next game."
2,"Good Tires but, TOO TIGHT!!!!!","I should have taken one of the previous reviews a little more seriously... these tires are way too tight and almost impossible to get on the rim. If I were to flat in a race, I would almost certainly lose about 20 minutes of time trying to get the tire off and get it back on. It's like they're too small or something."
1,AVOID - undersized diameter - extremely difficult to force over the rim,"The title says it all. I purchased these tires five months ago and put them away for future use. Unfortunately when I tried to mount one this morning, I was confronted with too-small diameter that makes the tire virtually impossible to force over the rim. I could force it that last little bit, using tire levers (and praying not to pinch the tube), but then what? That's not the end of the story. Fixing a flat out on the road under less than ideal conditions would be unacceptably difficult and time-consuming. So I'm going to try to return them. Wish me luck."
5,Best Scissors Ever,"These are the BEST kitchen scissors ever! They stay sharp, are easy to use, and have additional tools to open boxes. And if you get something on the blades, they disassemble easily for cleaning. I liked them so much that I bought several more, just so I don't have to go looking for them."
5,Chicago Cutlery Scissors,"I bought multiples of this product because I like them so much. We use them all over the house, from food prep to garage projects to opening boxes, etc. Can never have enough of them!"
4,Groovy,"This CD contains a nice mix of styles.. some more dance oriented - some more acid jazz. The overall appeal is it won't over power you with too much BOOM as some ""dance"" cd's can.. you can relax to it, have it behind a party mixer or do a little dancing."
2,Completely Baffled,"This book is filled with interesting info about Jackie. HOWEVER, it is also in need of some serious editing as the typos and grammatical errors are horrid. And I mean really horrid. After reading a few paragraphs aloud to my mother she couldn't understand how I could read any of the book at all. I am so baffled by how few people have mentioned this little fact. Often quotes are inserted that make no sense at all. Or a sentence just makes no sense at all. I have to read many parts over and over trying to make sense of it. Then when an error is in a quote (much of the book is random quotes from who knows who -- most of them are foot noted, but not all) it's difficult to tell if it was the original speaker or the author making the mistake.If you can get past the terrible mistakes and can handle the occasional run-on sentence that makes no sense, there is quite a bit of juicy info that makes for a fun read."
2,Take a Pass on This Book,"This book is nothing more than a rehash of old magazine articles and gossip about Jackie O. For anyone familiar with Jackie there is nothing new here -- a skirt-chasing, alcoholic father, an unfaithful husband, an example of grace and courage in mourning, a trophy wife, a dedicated mother -- we knew this and the author adds nothing new to the story."
3,Inconsistent,"Much of this book is well-traveled territory and doesn't add much that hasn't already been said dozens of times about Jackie's relationships with her dashing father, powerful father-in-law and complicated first husband. Her isolation from her sisters-in-law is same-old, same-old, too. What this book does benefit from is interviews with Jackie's sister, Lee Radziwell. Her insights into Jackie's relationship with their mother and of her time in Greece, moving between The Pink House and the Christina, are interesting and new. Because it's that exclusive material that sets this book apart from all the other Jackie tomes, I would have liked more new info on the Onassis years and less of the often told and retold tales of her time in The White House."
2,"Nothing new, some errors","I consider myself a great fan of both Jackie and the Camelot era, but this book left me very disappointed. The book is filled with typos! I disagree with much of Bradford's perception. There are so many better books on this subjest that offer great insight. Despite the lovely cover, this book was a let down"
2,Have read better regarding this remarkable woman.,"I have read right many books regarding Jackie, and I just didn't like this book. It was scattered and didn't always concentrate on her story. The whole book seemed to make her out as a money hungry thoughtless woman. I didn't like how it portrayed her at all. Very disappointed."
3,nothing new here,"same old, same old... I love Jackie, but there's really nothing left to say that hasn't been said... Disappointing."
1,Save your money,this book is the worst book on jackie yet. no new informayion at all. this book is just plain bad
4,A real page turner,"I never read a biography that kept me up until 2:00 oclock in the morning for three nights. The first president I voted for was JFK and the impact that the Kennedys had on my life has been tremendous, from the assasination of JFK to John Johns untimely death. It is sad to learn that Jackie was far from being the divine creaure she was imagined to be. I enthusiastically recommend this book to anyone who grew up in that era."
1,Weak Justification,"This essentially contains the speech that Elijah Muhammad made after Malcolm X's assassination. Mostly for the faithful who still followed Elijah Muhammad as opposed to Malcolm. To fully put this into context, one must have some familiarity with the events surrounding Malcolm's death. As with most of Elijah Muhammad's writngs and/or speeches, it's not likely to appeal to those who do not consider themselves admireres or followers of his. Not likely to win any new converts."
3,No going back,"This DVD Nkjv Bible is somewhere between dramatized and just being read. There are some different voices used for effect. Music not used for dramatic effect as in some. There is no rewind to go back a few verses and you are unable to choose a single verse and go directly to it. For the money, however, it is a great deal and it is on one disc only."
3,Get it just for the Count Meaple,I bought this just for the Count. Haven't actually tried it cause it sounds a bit wonky. The Count is Awesome though. Definitely worth having just for the Meaple.
3,Another expansion,"OK, if you are reading this you play Carcassone. How many expansion packs do we need? I have the first 2 (builders and traders adn inns and cathedrals) and always play with them. The Count adds something, but for me not a lot to the game. Most often, we just start with the river and don't bother with the count. If you don't have any of the expansion packs, I'd suggest one of the main ones first. Count changes game strategy a bit, but we haven't gotten into it that much."
4,Fun to play,"I bought this game for my husband for Christmas. The hope was that we could spend some time together with the TV off once the baby went to sleep. Well, it worked! We both love the game and can't wait to buy expansion packs."
3,Our Latin Heritage I,"This copy of Our Latin Heritage, though used, was in sufficiently good conditon to be useable by my students. I was completely satisfied with the book as is, and it met my expectations as to condition and cost.Servando Mendez"
4,perhaps more use of the author's background?,"This could certainly have been a much longer book. Boone gives us a precis of cryptology through the centuries. Though with a natural emphasis on the last hundred years. Because it in only within this period that mechanical and then electronic calculators and computers came to the fore, thus enabling ever more sophisticated algorithms and countermeasures.But both during and before this period, the book is a tribute to human ingenuity. For all the power of the latest computers used in encryption, they are merely idiot savants.Given the author's background, it is a pity that he could not have striven to write more, about strictly declassified matters. Which would have played to his strengths in his professional experience. While the historical material in the book is well written and accurate, other authors have covered those matters well. His comparative advantage perhaps was not put to full use here."
3,Concern,I have been taking this pill for about a week. My concern is the weight gain. have anyone gain weight from taking this pill?
1,Hair Revive,The capsules are nasty tasting and you have to take 4 of them a day. My hair loss is due to menopause and I didn't see any improvement whatsoever.
5,hair revive 5 capsules,"product was delivered quickly - nice turn around time, that is what the five stars is for. as for the product itself, after 4 weeks of use i haven't really noticed any out of the ordinary new hair growth, but i am an optimist ( or really desperate for results!!) and will give it another 4 weeks before i deem it unworthy of my hard earned cash"
5,works for me,Not yet two months of pill taking as directed and my nails are almost all hard now (a few are not there yet). I am not shedding either like before and my hair growth since Nov 22 has been a inch and a half and it is Jan 13 now. I am still on the first bottle of my order. Started noticing a difference about three weeks into it. My face looks younger too. I will order a refill. Pills do taste gross. My once long hard nails were bending easily before and my hair was shedding and hardly growing and have been getting worse in the last five years. I do take thyroid meds. I am on the four a day though right now. I will drop back to the two a day as directed.
1,didnt notice anything.,"i used this product for one month and did not notice any change in regrowth of hair. i had started to loose alot of hair about 9 months ago, realized it was just hormonal but thought this would encourage growth, didnt notice anything."
4,Helped with my hair growth,I really think this product is helping to thicken my hair. I have very fine thin hair so I purchased this product to help thicken and grow my hair. I'm finish taking one bottle and can see improvement already. I will continue taking them to see how thick my hair will get. I gave it four stars because I still have one more bottle to take......they sent two bottles.
4,Very happy,I have been taking these vitamins along with using Revita Shampoo and Conditioner and it has worked in stopping my hair loss and even thickened up my hair. I have been very happy taking these capsules.
5,Perfect for my over-processed hair.,"I am a 20 year old female who dyed her hair one too many times and saw too much hair go down the shower drain! I have always had extremely thick hair, but got scared when someone pointed out it had been the same length for an entire year (only trims every other month even). This is my second bottle of these hair pills and after one month (one bottle) my coworkers were making remarks about how noticeably longer my hair had gotten (from people who I had no idea I was taking them). It drastically improved the texture of my hair too and made it easy to hide all my stray broken hairs. I am glad I found these pills early in life, I don't think I'll ever have to worry! **my nails have also very long and thick. (turns pee green, but I looked it up and it is not harmful, it is just all the vitamins)"
3,works,Didn't give the roduct a chance to work. Used the bottle up and didn't see any results so I didn't reorder. I should have kept using
2,Hair capsules,"So far I have not seen any results, but I have taken these capsules for a month only. If I don't see the slightest improvement in one more month, it's not worth it."
2,Did not work for me.,"I had high hopes for this product but have not seen any improvements in hair growth, length or thickness. No new hair growth either. After using for more than 2 months now, it is safe to say that this product does not work."
5,Great product so far,I have been using this product for about a month and it seems to be working. I am african american and I had used a product that took my hair out. I discovered this product and have used it continuously. My hair is coming in nicely. I will continue to use it to see how well it works.
3,Hair Revive,"I'm working on the third bottle of Hair Revive and honestly, I don't see any difference in my hair. It also gives me a bad taste in my mouth for about an hour after I take the pills. This product may work better on other people. It's not for me."
5,"Excellent product, wonderful results!","I am a 60 year old woman. About 3 months ago my hair started falling out rapidly. I would notice it shedding constantly. Then I was shocked when I noticed some balding patches in front at my hairline. I don't know what caused the hair loss. I know that my hormones were briefly imbalanced--huge amounts of testosterone from a DHEA face cream and I had also done a quick, severe, detox diet. But whatever, the reason, the sudden hair loss and constant shedding was alarming. I started using this product and rather quickly I noticed that my hair had stopped shedding. Then I noticed that it began to grow back and fill in. I highly recommend this product. Although I also used a topical product--Murad--on the thinning areas, I have to credit this product, because the topical application was limited to the front and my hair stopped shedding all over. I also like that you are approaching the problem from the inside out."
2,Absolutely worthless.,"Dole originally sold these pineapple chunks in unsweetened pineapple juice, which was really worth buying. Now, they've decided it's cheaper to sell it in light syrup, which makes the flavour cloying and the value of this jar of sugary blandness drop to nil. I didn't give it ONE star because, technically, it's still edible if you're starving. But as for its value? Nada. Nichts. Niente."
4,Inexpensive & useful,"This is quite useful. Has multiple mounting options which is particularly handy. For example, can be mounted from the front or the back with the enclosed mounting tape. The smaller size also facilitates placement in tighter locations. As for accuracy I tested it to a known accurate thermometer and it is within a degree or two- note the scale is quite large so pinpoint accuracy isn't really possible. It is made of ""ok"" plastic- nothing especially robust."
1,Temperature is off,This thermometer varies between 5 and 10 degrees off from what I measure using a digital stick thermometer in a glass of water.
4,A Fleshed-Out Ghost Month,"THEY WAIT provides another view of the theme presented in GHOST MONTH, i.e. a month dedicated souly (sorry) to the dead. THEY WAIT is more successful, with accomplished actors, somewhat larger budget & decidedly better, more ""fleshed-out"" script. The idea of sweatshop ghosts taking revenge on their tormentors is appealing. Good FXs too."
1,DK deserves better,"I'm the Strategy Gaming guide for BellaOnline.Com, so I play tons of games and have to figure out every twist and trick in them. Sometimes I'll read the guides afterwards, to see how well I found everything. Reading this one was incredibly disappointing! Anything that's in this book is pretty obvious, and certainly available out on web sites. Definitely not for any gamer's bookshelf!"
1,My younger brother could've given better advice.,"I can't believe I paid money for this! There's better material to be found online, anyday! Thank god I was able to return it in time!"
2,Exhorbitant shipping prices to the 49th state of the Union,"This is a good product, it's too bad I can't enjoy it and had to order from another company because you were going to charge me almost THIRTY DOLLARS in shipping costs for a few packages of tinfoil liners that only cost $1.99 each!!! It does NOT cost that much to ship to Alaska. FYI the USPS flat rate Priority is the same no matter which state you're sending it to, hence the name ""flat"" rate."
4,"gas burner disposable bib, round 5 pak 7-1/2"" liners",I purchased these for my daughter in her first apartment with small gasstove...It keeps the stovetop protected and clean and is perfect for thosewho don't want to spend time scrubbing with SOS pads. Allows mom timeto visit instead of cleaning!!!
3,Great for short term use cleanup,Foil does not maintain shape and not practical or cost effective for daily use. It did work well for keeping holiday cooking cleanup at a minimum.
2,Best price/Best Junk,"I tried to save a few bucks over a competitors competing product, however these bibs are too flimsy(junk class) I'll use these now that I payed for them by twisting, bending and re-shaping tyhem in to some useable order, but I'll never buy Handi Foil again. I've learned my lesson, ""You get what you pay for !)"
4,"Great fit, great capaciity, great lightweight pack!","Excellent product. The capacity of the water itself is perfect for a full day hike, you will have plenty of water available. The fit is great, I had no back pain after a full week's use. And the cargo compartment expands or compresses based on how much you pack in. Great product!"
4,It was fun to play,"If you love the WWF, this game is perfect for you. However it easy to complete the game eliminating challenge factor. Definitely a game for all your friends"
2,Preety Lame,"My 7 yr. old who loves wrestling was not very thrilled with this game. It has many wrestlers who are unknown to him and not very exciting. Also, when you choose a wrestler it takes about 7 seconds after clicking the person's name before seeing a picture of them. This is annoying to my son who usually chooses a wrestler based on how they look but instead has to read their names and click on one who he never heard of and wait around before a picture appears so he can see who they are. Overall, thumbs down. But then again, this may be due to the fact that he already has all the new wrestling games so this outdated one cannot compare."
1,ohhh THE PAIN!!!,This wwf game sucks...Boring...Graphics are alright...It was just plain awful EVEN FOR IT'S TIME!UGH this game was slowww...ooooooo...Don't get this game..GET NO MERCY! BEST WWF GAME EVER!...This game was very dull and boring...If I could give it a zero I would...THIS GAME FLAT OUT SUCKS!good thing I Baught this for a 2 bucks....But still that was a waste...Later
5,this game is da bomb,when I first got this game I couldn't stop playing it. I really liked the move menu. I thought the game was easy to figure out. I kept getting better and better at it. I started career mode and that was so cool. the create a character was really fun because I could give my guy the best moves.Any true WWF fan would love this game.
2,Who needs titles anyways?,"Way back in the day, maybe Warzone was cool. But to you people who still thinks this game rocks after all these years, there is much better...(stuff) out there now. Ever heard of a Nintendo 64??? Look for WWF No Mercy, or even Wrestlemania, and you'll get alot more action and perhaps more satisfaction. Looking back at Warzone now, what we thought was an amazing Create-A-Player is considered puny to the ones of No Mercy, or Smackdown. Warzone feels slow, making it look like your wrestler gained about twenty years just hopping into the ring. Warzone, in other words, is just old lame ...(stuff) =o). Go find yourself a real wrestling game, like No Mercy or Smackdown if you are still playing this terrible game called WWF Warzone."
5,Awesome,"Use to play this as a kid and when I played it, it brought back all kinds of memories from my childhood. Definitely a game to have if you are or were a fan of wrestling."
5,Great!,"5 stars! This hood is exactly like the 29 gallon hood it replaced. That hood was the original one from that ""save money. live better"" store."
1,Not for anything other than the most popular consumer films,"The first step in scanning either film or slides is to select the type of film used. NONE of the films in my library are included on the selection lists. The small print on the last page of the manual also says that it does not scan Kodachrome slides well. About 90% of my film library is Kodachrome 64 slides. It WON'T handle any film with an ASA of less than 100 or any very high speed films (some of mine are 800 and 1600 speed). When I say it won't handle them - technically, it can, but it takes at least an hour to fudge with the settings to get the scan to turn out like the original picture. This one's going back."
1,3650U scanning nightnmare,Giving this piece of junk a 1 star is a compliment. The first one I recieved had a big yellow blur down the side when you scanned. I sent it back and got a second unit. It did not have the blur but after a few slides the scanning element would jam and not retract. At the same time the software would freeze. The only solution to unfreeze it was to reboot. Enough is enough. No chance for a third strike. Stay away from this one.
1,Dosen't work,"I bought it to scan slides and it doesn't do it. Oh, it scans them, sloooowly, but the result is a blob of color; not the image. The help manual is horrible; the Scanning Slides and Film chapter doesn't mention slides at all. Perhaps it works for the inventor who likely knows all the secrets of tweaking it but the manual doesn't explain anything at all about slides. This machine, at least for slides which is what I unfortunately bought it or, don't do the job."
3,Slide Scanner,"The scanner seems to work well but it is very slow and tedious to work with. The quality of the slides, once scanned, are OK but certainly not exceptional. I will continue to use the product but it has a lot of room for improvement on the next model."
1,I think it goes bad just sitting there,"I've had two of these. The first one failed after about ten scans. I returned it. The second one failed about as fast, however, since I had not used it much and it was outside the warranty the only option was a factory repair (too expensive compared to just buying a new one) or to buy a replacement part based on the factory diagnosis of the problem for about $40 and fix it myself. Based upon my experience with the quality of the parts in these scanners, this did not seem to be a good alternative as the part could not be returned and was without any guarantees at all. Based on my limited experience, it appears to me that the scanner fails if it just sits unused for a period of time."
5,Lovin' it,"I am very happy with this scanner. It is not fast. Not for commercial use. But if you keep feeding slides as they scan you will eventually get your collection done. The ICE technology is marvelous. I tested it on my most damaged slide. (It had previously been unmounted, creased from bending, and badly scratched...hundreds of scratches.) The ICE took out all but one scratch that was easy to edit out manually."
5,Wonderful asset for at home or on the road,"This book helps me and my husband make decisions on where we want to eat, drink, explore and budget for when we are at home in Lawrence, KS, or traveling. These are the places full of local flavor and local drinks. Susan Kraus gives some sound advice on shopping, lodging and recreation, and some of her comments are quite witty. Good read. Good practical guide for residents of towns of the Big 12 and athletic fans. Pick it up you'll find something in there for you, including chapters on each of the universities of the Big 12 Conference."
5,Todo Seru es genial,"Con ciertas bandas y artistas resulta extremadamente difícil recomendar uno u otro trabajo. Serú Girán, la tercera banda que tuvo el genio musical Argentino Charly García (teclado, voz y otros) junto al maestro Pedro Aznar (bajo, voz y otros), David Lebón (guitarra y voces) y Oscar Moro (batería), es uno de esos casos. ""Grasa de las capitales"" contiene el tema que le da nombre al álbum, que posiblemente sea capaz de resumir la quintaesencia de la banda como ningún otro, pero es un crimen musical dejar por fuera, como secundarios, excelentes trabajos como el primer álbum de la banda (""Serú Girán""), ""Bicicleta"" o ""Peperina"". Sin duda alguna, recomiendo cualquier trabajo de la banda, sin temor a equivocarme. Se trata de uno de esos raros ensambles que reúne a varios genios, y cuyo resultado no puede ser otro sino una serie de increibles álbumes de muy buena música."
3,A good chew.,"These candies are really tasty with good,chewy mouth feel, but for the price there are others that are as good. I would buy them again, but not exclusively."
1,junk,I am not a pro artist by any means...but these pencils suck. The majority of them were unusable because the leads broke after every sharpening. I'll never buy a product made by this manufacturer again.
1,they suck,i started using them liked them at first then i went to sharpen and they broke and cracked these are crap
1,Prismacolor scholar 36 pack colored pencils,I think having 2 whites is ridiculous that makes 34 pencils. white is not a color. The colors are not even and NOT blendable. I did not know this and now they are used. I will go to the local art store in the future
5,Pencils,This was my grandson's Christmas present last year and he has never tired of them. A good product that will last.
4,great guide to teaching self defense,I am a 2nd degree black belt in karate and also teach women's self defense. I started looking for references to guide me in developing my SD class and came across this book. This book has been a great help for me in organizing my class. I highly recommend it.
4,Comprehensive walkthrough on California,"This is a fine book. 650 pages crammed with information, such as regions (counties), producers, wines, vintages in abundant amounts. I have to agree with earlier posts on most points. Some (more) labels would've been nice, although. Interesting statistics are also added (eg grape variety) and description on grape types. A good book for the beginner as well as the 'half-pro'. Includes description of vintages up to 1997 (book is 2nd edition, printed in 99). All-in-all : recommendable..:-)"
3,Good book for the price,"The book is very conprehensive,has a lot of information on the wineries in California, and is well organized although somewhat dated information on the wineries."
4,Great fun and easy to learn!,"Flux is pretty much that. The game rules change as you play. At the start the game there are no victory conditions, but as you draw and play cards you change the rules and victory condition.While this sounds complex, it's no more difficult than playing something like 21 with normal cards. A group can be up and playing in a matter of minutes and the rulebook is only a few pages long.If you or your friends like games, but hate complex rules and long games this is the one for you!At times, the game can be quite random or require a lot of luck but its a lot of fun. Games can last a few hands or half an hour depending on the draws and how players play the game."
4,The Diffrance,"Just so everyone knows, there IS a diffrance in Fluxx and Fluxx 3.1. In myopinion, Fluxx 3.1 is better, but I guess it depends on wether you played theoriginal or the new vershion first. (Realy sorry, I can't spell.)"
4,A new game everytime.,"I good tell you about the rules, but they are always changing. I could tell you the goal of the game, but they change as well. I picked this game up 2 years ago and everyone that we introduce it to has to pick up their own copy. There is definately some strategy, but luck as well. Games have lasted from 5 minutes to about 30. One nice feature is that people can join the game after it is already started. A great game to travel with since anyone can play.The game starts with the basic, draw one, play one- but is quickly modified with how many cards draw or play each turn, how many cards you can keep in your hand, and how many ""keepers"" you can have."
3,Fun game for all ages,This game is a little confusing at first but easy to learn. It's a great game to play with kids and adults combined.
5,4Triangles,"I was extremely pleased with 4Triangles company, I ordered 4 card games, which didn't arrive, I contacted the company and we both tried to track the package, when it didn't come, they sent me my card games again, which came in a timely manner. The whole time C.H was in touch with me on email, keeping me apprised of the situation. It turned out that the usps found the package ripped open and the card games gone. (a very rare occuaence). I was very pleased with the service I received and would highly recommend this company. The game is alot of fun and good for any age."
2,Not great for serious gamers,This game may be okay for a group that just wants to waste sometime but for me Fluxx is just too random. The rules change so fast there is no way you can develope any kind of coherent strategy and eventually someone just lucks into a win. I guess it would be good for teaching kids the basics of following game rules but as far as good game design I give it a thumbs down.
3,Not For The Modest,"Sex.Drugs.Carnies.Sex.Sound like fun? Actually, as long as you're not too much of a prude, you'll probably find this book's incessant sex and violence kind of funny, and definately entertaining.However, unlike other books of this ilk (Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Naked Lunch) don't expect any sort of deeper meaning or a unique look at life in today's world. Don't expect any meaning at all really. Just be prepared to chuckle."
2,"Buy the paperback, not the e-book","I was very excited to receive this book as part of LibraryThing's reviewer give away. I had heard excellent things about both the author and the book itself. Next time, however, I will buy the paperback format.My e-book arrived full of errors, not only grammatical and spelling, but in the section breaks. A line would end in the middle of a word and carry over to the next page, making it very difficult to follow. So difficult, in fact, that I gave up on the book not even a third of the way through.I have since purchased a paperback copy and will be giving the book another try, because I am sure it is an excellent read. The e-book, however, is distracting and poorly edited."
1,Not a Good Read,"This was the worst book I have ever tried to read. Pornographic, poorly written and filled with the most tired cliches that one can imagine. I am not put off by sex in my reading material, but this was beyond ridiculous. This book is only for the guys into Super 8, movie porn, not anyone who cares about what they read."
1,Bukowski it is not,"I tried to like this book. I tried to look for elements of Bukowski or Burroughs or Thompson or any of the great ""dirty realism"" writers that I love. Though certain portions of text (albeit rarely) may have made me laugh I could find little of what makes the previous authors so good in ""Tattoo"". I'm not a prudish person but the sex scenes were so frequent and predictable that it became laughable. If Everhard is a real person (and I don't much care if he is or not) then his story is as fictitious as the day is long. If you want a book that will literally arouse you and won't ask for much thought then I suppose this may be a good choice. If you want great writing that ignores social convention and so-called ""ethics"" stick to the classics. This isn't good enough to mop up Bukowski's spilled wine and to use his name (on the back cover) is disingenuous at best and fraudulent at worst."
4,"A little pricey, but worth the convenience","I just installed this refrigerator in my office, and it is very quiet... in fact can't even hear it. My office neighbor's AC is way louder. I paid the extra for an ""all refrigerator"" so that I don't need to be concerned about defrosting every 3 months. It fits perfectly where I pictured it in the corner of my small office space, and I hope lives up to what the reviews say about keeping things refrigerator cold as opposed to cooler only cold. The black color also blends in well with my office furniture/decor. I ordered it on Sunday night, received it on Wednesday afternoon, and I live on a neighbor island in the state of Hawaii. I was impressed that shipping rate was really reasonable as well. If it lasts as long as my other mini fridge at home, I'll be very happy camper."
2,Very Disappointed,Temperature control really stinks- the slightest adjustment moves the temperature from the high 40's to the low 20's. Even in the low 20's it keeps running trying to go lower. No I do not have it on Max cold.
3,It's Alright,"I do quite a bit of drawing with dip pens. I got Speedball ink because my local art store really doesn't have much of a variety. This ink is rather cheap, and I wasn't exactly pleased with the way Higgens ink looked.The main thing about Speedball is that it dries dark. Unless you are painting it on, in which case you may need a few coats, but I find that to be true of most inks. It also dries very quickly, which is a definite plus in my book, as I'm left-handed.when I paint with it, it tend to develop a shine to it that I don't much care for, but that's just a really big problem. My main problem with it, however, is that it's not quite as waterproof as it claims. Even after waiting for it to dry, the ink still mixes with the watercolors."
4,Drys fast and Dark,I didn't like it at first because it dries maybe too fast (making my dip pen nib clogged)and would bleed like hell when I tried it onto ordinary copy paper. I added some water to fix the drying problem. Felt much better. The bleeding problem does not happen with heavier drawing paper thus it doesn't bother me in the end. I haven't had a chance to test its waterproofing ability yet coz I only color my pictures on my computer. But I found that i can no longer just wash the ink away from the nib with running water--possibly an indicator of the pigment's water-resisting quality.
2,Not Impressed,I attempted to use this ink for scrimshaw but found it to be VERY watery and absolutely useless for what I needed.
4,"1,000 miles on paved + 300 on indoor bike trainer = np",Came as OEM equipment on my Schwinn (2008 or 2009) Super Sport Ultra II/2 road bike. No problems at all.
3,meh.,"Got this tire replacing some worn Continental Ultrasports hoping that it would last longer. Unfortunately I managed to wear a hole in the side of the tire tooling around campus in four months. Hoped that the durability would be greater, but perhaps I should stop riding my fixed gear like a cross bike. Anyways - decent tire, the front is still rolling great with no problems but on the back it's been crap so far. Two flats and it's dead now."
2,Not thorn resistant!,"I've owned these tires for about 3 months now; they came with my new bike. For about the first 300 miles, I had no issues. However today, I had a total of 3 flats: twice in the front and once in the rear tire!I must have ridden through a rough patch of burrs, since both tires went flat at the same time. I found one small burr in the front tire, and TWO burrs stuck in the rear tire!After replacing both tubes, I rode for a few miles, and then the front tire got another flat!Honestly I expect better from tires than this. They're not even that old! I'll be replacing with Conti Gatorskins or Specialized Armadillos."
1,Cracked...,"After only about 200 miles on these tires, they began to crack. Pretty terrible. I would not recommend these tires."
3,Interesting Reading!,This is a good DVD if you want to read and hear the bible in modern English. Be careful thought some usage of words can be tricky. Cross referencing scriptures is important as well as having a bible dictionary on hand.
4,Very good cumulative knitting guide,"This was really comprehensive, from the basics of knit and purl, to demonstrating Continental and American, showing the process from sheep to yarn, dyeing, types of fibers and how they knit - you name it - its in there. My only dislike was the varying sound quality, and sometimes the camera angle was a bit awkward. The Jennifer Knits sections were consistantly good, and the trip to the Alpaca farm and the fiber processing were really interesting."
3,"Not bad, but poor camera angles","I found the knitting instruction to be very difficult to see. The camera jumped all over as the hands kept moving and didn't focus tightly enough for me to see what she was doing. I recently bought a how to knit package at Target (included yarn and pattern and DVD) and they showed the knitting hands from all angles over and over and over again. For someone like me, a brand new knitter who hadn't tried it before, the Art of Knitting doesn't show the hands well enough to follow. Later on there's another section (the intermediate section) that is MUCH better with regards to camera not jumping around, but still not as well lit or miked so there was an echo.I am going to look at the rest of the DVD but if there's only 35 minutes of actual knitting, then it's a big disappointment."
2,Very Sad,"I'm sad to say that this DVD was a disappointment. I appreciate the efforts the girls on the dvd made, but it just didn't get there. The camera angles were poor and I couldn't see what the teacher was doing.A friend gave me this dvd as a gift because I've been wanting to learn how to knit for a long time. There is so much on this dvd that I don't need, so much clutter that it was confusing just to navigate it. I feel bad for the people who made it, but I have to let other potential buyers know what a low quality product I think they're getting.Sorry, but I don't recomment this dvd...."
5,SIX Stars If I Could!!!,"The Art of Knitting was great for a beginner knitter like myself. A few minutes after popping in the DVD I was on my way to knitting my first hat. The Knitting Library was great for help w/ terms and abbreviations and the jazz selection to knit by was wonderful. This DVD is a great introduction to the world of knitting and has a ton of exciting projects for beginner and advanced knitters alike. If you feel overwhelmed when looking at knit book instructions and illustrations then I would highly reccmmend this DVD because the knitting lessons with Jennifer makes you feel like you have your very own personal instructor. There's so much on this DVD you just have to see it for yourself, I know you'll love it too! I can easily see why this is the #1 knitting DVD on the market. Go and buy it!"
3,disappointed its not marked in Newton-meters,"Contrary to the previous reviewer, this wrench is NOT marked in Nm (Newton-meters). Rather, it's marked in ft-lbs and m-Kgs. While that means it's technically both metric and SAE, the metric scale that is listed in all of auto manuals is Nm.The construction of the wrench appears decent and it feels good, but I don't want to have to consult a torque-conversion table every time I tighten something. So I may just end up sending this back and try to fine another 3/8"" marked in Nm. Too bad... it appears to be a good product."
5,Faster than a speeding bullet,Arrived with free shipping almost before I ordered it... second day. For use with standard threading. Short handle and lower possible settings make this ideal for the shadetree mechanic. Easy to adjust and gives clear feedback. Great for spark plugs.
4,"Sunex 3/8"" Torque Wrench","Works great..solidly built..excellent value. See my review for the Sunex 1/2"" Drive torque wrench."
1,Just so much background noise....,"I guess if I were a dentist in New Mexico this music would be great to play while putting my patients into dream sleep so I could scrape the Quarter Pounder residue off of their gums.If I owned a skyscraper in Colorado, this CD would be perfect background noise to welcome my guests into the elevator. Enjoy your 38 second ride to the 3rd floor while you listen to this souless pap.I was hoping for authentic Native American music when I got this CD. And while the music here most likely has origins in Native American culture, the translation to this disk is all but lost.""Spiritlands"" consists of 8 tracks of electro-flute, computerized drum tracks and thunderstorm sound effects mooshed together in a way that lacks any heart or soul. It's almost like someone said I want to put these sounds together in a way the will evoke almost no emotion at all.Pass on this one.....unless you need music for your elevator."
4,"A good read, good reality check","Book is a good read to bring your busy life back into reality. The book tells his story of moving away from the busy life, to one with next to nothing for services. Kinda like going back into the late 1800's with problems with water, heat, and things they live through.You don't have to go to this extreme he does in his book to find God. Just find to time to get away and don't take the cell phone, email along will help bring God back into your busy life. Camping, national park...get out and find time to think and reflect on life and what is important to you. Good read of a few hours, well worth the time that you are otherwise using on meaningless things anyway."
5,life changing,this book was the spring board for teaching me just how personal God is and how to apply practically what i know as a christian to my personal relationship with God
2,no zipper,"I was super excited for these boots. All the straps looked awesome... but there was no zipper. Maybe I had a defective pair, I don't know, but there was no zipper and the amount of time it would take to buckle all those straps made me not like all those awesome straps."
5,This book portrays the life of a bad young child,this book shows how much that a young boy can get into so much trouble but yet still be loved by so many people
2,Dissatisfied with condition of the book,"I was very disappointed in the condition of the book. It looked as if it had been left out in the rain and then left to dry. The back part of the book was swollen. As far as the story, it was very enjoyable. I'm really enjoying reading these books about Joe Grey."
5,Wonderful transaction!,"This seller is wonderful! Highly recommend using this seller, and I will in the furture myself. Delivery was done with speed and book was as advertized. Seller rates 5 stars from me."
5,Great read!,"If you like to relax and slip into another world, this is the book for you. Joe grey is the perfect detective."
4,Cat Seeing Double,"I expect I'll like this book as much as other Joe Grey mysteries, but I haven't had a chance to read it yet."
2,A fairly useless book,"I found this book to be quite useless. A lot of the information is old and outdated. There is much better, and more unbiased information available on the various college forums. There is so much redundancy in this book that it makes you wonder if any real research was done (I mean, how many campuses are engulfed in Ambercromie and Fitch, or are rated by Playboy for this or that, or you should bring a warm jacket - DUH). They raved about my alma mater, SUNY-Binghamton, being a diverse student body. Oh please - 96% of the kids from the greater NYC area. They might be different colors or whatever, but they are not diverse. For another school, Alfred Univ, they talk about the frats. Alfred got rid of its frats in 2002. Those are just a couple of the examples of poor information."
2,This Book is Not as good as it seems,"I bought this book, and I looked at what the book said about my college (Pitzer) and everything you could pick off the website they got right. But as many have said before me, they get A LOT wrong. For example they say the school has two places students can eat, mentioning a place called ""The Gold Mine,"" they mention this place a number of times, yet it does not exist. They talk about ""nick names"" that everyone calls the dorm buildings, nicknames that I have NEVER heard. Another example is the big fair that Pitzer has each year, there is a very strange story behind how the fair started. If they asked anyone on campus about the fair, they would could tell them the story. Yet the book says its a fair celebrating the coming of spring. Why would a college located in southern CA, with warm weather year round have a fair celebrating the coming of warm weather in the rest of the country? Yale kids are smarter then that? Arn't they?"
2,Biased Ivy League reviews,"This is a decent guide for the most part. The trouble is that the authors' biases are clear when they review Yale's ""rival"" schools. Is anyone surprised that this book makes Yale out to be the flawless shining star of the Ivy League and Harvard, Princeton, et al. to be overrated, filled with unhappy students, etc.? The not-so-subtle advertising compromises the book's integrity where the Ivy League is concerned. If those are the schools that interest you, Fiske and Princeton Review are better bets."

4,Sweet story of a boy's search for his Mother,I read this story as a teenager and loved it. It is a story of a foster child's (Davey) search for his birth mother.
3,Not bad for an old text,"Silly me. I thought I was buying a new 2009 text book for under fifty cents! When I got it, I was still pleased, even after looking at the copyright date for 1998! The book was still in pretty good condition, and has helped me out a little until the right edition comes."
5,Fun and Colorful Card Game,I recently discovered this fabulous game. It is very simple to play and easy to understand. I played it with the students as part of an after-school games club at my local elementary school. After about five minutes they had it down cold. The colorful cards are fun to look at and easy to read.The game can be played with up to 5 players as each tries to complete connections of seven cards. Each player has a secret goal and action cards can change the goals at any time. I highly recomend Aquarius for any game player.
4,Atlas of clinical neurology,"An authorative and comprehensive resource for anyone involved with the clinical neurosciences. The illustrations, radiographs and photographs are superb. Excellent as a visual teaching aid for both patient and medical students."
1,Sent it Back,"This product was a disaster. It sputtered through its vapor hole in the lid and sent rice starch everywhere. I must have gotten a defective one because it was not possible to make rice with it. It would not shut off (actually I never let it run long enough to find out after smelling burning rice).I went to Target and bought 19 dollar ""Aroma"" rice cooker based on the recommendation of a Korean friend. It works great!! I use it constantly for making rice and steaming vegetables. I can cook an entire meal with it at once. I don't can't imagine how spending another 80 to 180 dollars could improve upon it.You don't need to spend 100 to 200 dollars to get a decent rice cooker for the home."
1,Dangerous Product,I recommend NOT purchasing this wheel. The metal bar running surface is an accident waiting to happen. I have seen too many animals get their legs and feet caught in between the bars and end up hanging until they are found and/or ending up with broken limbs. Get a wheel with a solid or mesh running surface instead. I would give it 0 stars if I could.
1,IN My Opinion!,"In my opinion the production of the rendezvous was very well done when it came to scenery etc. The topic, ""competition"" basically only cover knife and hawk throwing!! There is far more to a rendezvous than that. So I was very disappointed in having to watch that long of a video only covering that one event. I would not buy this video!!!!"
4,Misleading info in other reviews!,The engine does NOT need to be running to operate this blanket! This blanket only draws 4-6 amps and would not drain battery unless plugged in over a 18 hour period. Could it be possible that what the problem was that her outlet doesnt operate unless the key is in the On position or Accessory position?Also this blanket can be hooked up to a battery with a separate adapter(Radio Shack).In that case I would purchase a deep cycle battery and place in the rear of car.
2,ENGINE MUST BE RUNNING TO USE THIS,I bought this for long distance travel. So I could save on Hotels...BUT ENGINE MUST BE RUNNING TO USE THIS. Thats stinks and it was a waste of my money. If you dont have heat in your car..well this blanket would be perfect for you. Useless. I wanted this for camping also...thought it would hook up to a battery of some sort. ARGHHHHH
1,piece of crap,Husqvarna used to make a quality product. Now the quality of Husqvarna can be compared to Ryobi or Poulan. Dont waist your money on a Husqvarna product. Go with a STIHL if quality matters to you
2,THIS TRIMMER IS HIGHLY OVERRATED,"The Husky 125L works well when it does. Hence, the 2 stars.However, within one month of the purchase date (July 29, 2006) the trimmer would not start. I had it serviced, waiting weeks for parts to arrive. The problem was a failed ""ignition module."" Two months later, the throttle cable failed, which is where I am now.I don't abuse the equipment. I clean and service my power tools regularly.I will have the unit serviced once more, then get rid of it for a trimmer from a different manufacturer.And, I thought Husky's were tough. Pfft!"
4,Great little trimmer!,"I recently picked up this trimmer not only for my yard, but helping to generate a little cash on the side as well. So far I've been impressed with my little Husky. Any small engine takes a little time to break in. The manufacturer states 8-10 tanks of oil/gas mix for this model, but it's probably closer to 15. The design is fairly well balanced, light, and offers good power for the weight. I think the handle feels a little chintzy, but it works fine. The auto return ""always on"" switch is a nice touch also. Having operated string trimmers for literally hundreds of hours over the past six or seven years, I know what I'm talking about. I've run Hondas, Shin's, echos, stihl (FS 80 R... alot), and even lowly Weedeaters - this is a nice trimmer, especially for the money. The other are heavier duty (except weedeater of course), but twice the price. Look at this or Tanaka."
3,F-100 Super Sabre,"This is a 32 page book, 16 of which are color drawings of the F-100 Super Sabre. The text deals mainly with what plane was with which squadron and the colors used by that air squadron.3 of the color pages show details such as wheel wells, cockpit and fighter pilot uniform.This book is really for modelers. At the risk of a ""spoiler"" every F-100 shown here is depicted in all natural metal. The color comes from the variations of unit creasts, flashing, designs on the tail. Other than modelers, the only others who would really have an interst are those who worked with or on F-100's."
3,Getting thru it...,"Even tho it starts slow and has probably more of a history lesson than I wanted, the story about Derek Prince is very encouraging and enlightening. Not sure I like the writer's style. I would have wanted to see more direct info about Derek Prince than the writer's opinions. All-in-all, I would recommend it to anyone who wants to get info about the man behind the ministry of Derek Prince as there is little else written about his live personally."
4,Derek Prince: A Biography,"Steven Mansfield did a good job chronicling a man's life journey from birth to death without getting tangled up in the details. Prince's candid and humble interview recorded at the beginning of the book enabled the reader to sort out the highs & lows in his life as you followed his story. Prince pursued God from the moment he accepted Jesus as his savior. However, like all humans, he was human. Mansfield, again, did a fine job to give the facts and tell the unbiased story."
2,The Shepherd Movement,"Derek Prince had a major hand in a teaching that is known as the Shepherding movement in the 70's and 80's. This movement led thousands of Christians astray from following Jesus to following and submitting totally to so called shepherds and leaders without being able to question their authority. These types of false doctrines are always springing up within the Church to lead folks away from the teaching of the Cross. If it doesn't totally center on the work of Jesus Christ and the Cross he endured for us, stay away from it. Just a little friendly advice from someone who was personally involved in this movement for a short time in the early 70's."
1,Crappy Copy,This game is a unworthy copy of Deccent and has the worst gameplay ever. I spent a lot on it last year and played it twice thengave it to a friend. If you want a cool flying game get Air Combat.
4,Phatty Beatz,"If you like the darker jungle beatz, I think you'll like this compilation even more than the original. I find that I'm listening to Disk 1 more than Disk 2 - mebbe cuz I like Ed Rush's ""Raven"" so much. I think Disk 2 is more chill as well. So forget Goldie's disasterous Saturnz Return and get yerself some mo'Breakz.I gave it 4/5 stars only cuz I was hoping for more ragga.Peace"
3,Good but still not quite the first,"I don't know how many of you bought and were hooked on the original 1996 Platinum Breakz but I was and while I did like this cd it had a lot of tracks that didn't quite meet the sophistication and creative intellect level that the first did. They did play with a much darker sound and it worked out pretty well on tracks like Arabian Nights, Raven, and a few others but some of the tracks seemed very cheesy and sloppily thrown together (ie disc 1 track 5). It also had a Your Sound remix which I think J Majik would have been better off either adding a bit of melody & subtle sickbass or just leaving alone and not remixing it. It's still cool to listen to, stilla part of Metalheadz history if you wanna stake your claim to it but I'd still recommend the original Platinum Breakz or the other 2 post 2000 ones first (just got Metalheadz 03' today and it wasn't all that bad)."
3,hibiscus & palm tree bag,"I purchased this bag before going on a cruise. I was hoping it would be big enough for beach stuff, towels, etc. While the bag seems to be well made it wasn't as big as I had hoped. It only held 2 towels(and had to remain unzipped) but it does have a vinyl like lining which helped keep other things protected from the water. I was hoping for a bag to hold 4 towels as I have had in the past. It is more of a medium size bag than large."
2,"Decent, though seemingly embittered","Speaking as a polymodal synesthete with eidetic memory, I found this work interesting (in terms of tracing synesthesia in art and literature from Baudelaire and the Romantics to Nabokov and the present day), but with an infused tonality of bitterness (lacking in empathic/human quality). After a certain point, it becomes clear that the author is biased toward a focus on the meaninglessness of these modes of perception, discounting them as relevant thought processes. Another view from the ""outside"", providing yet more separation between the synesthete and the non-synesthete... but I'm certain my opinion could be deconstructed by the views presented in this book. Recommended for historical content, and very basic information. Ignore the sweeping generalizations."
4,"Reality, anyone?","what if a loud shirt really was loud? Or the number ""5"" was red? Or you could smell Beethoven? Nabokov was a famous synesthete, as was Kandinsky and Van Goght. There sense are intertwined, so that one sensory stimulation causes a reaction with another sense. This is a great book which makes you question how real our world is, how sure our senses, and how multidimensional things are."
5,Great Item!,This window shade fits great and looks even better. It keeps my car so much cooler...even in the Las Vegas heat.
3,Not what I expecgted,I thought it would cover more of my dash. I could have bought a store cheapy for less than a third of this price and been just as well off. Very dissatisfied.
1,Poor service website confusion,"The product is fine but Covercraft web interface with Amazon and Covercraft customer service is poor. There was delay in shipping because their inventory is small. When it arrived, it was for a Dakota not a Ram dodge truck. They blamed me for ordering the wrong part and made me pay return shipping. I used the model selection input on the amazon web site with my correct veicle information. They told me there was a problem with that part of web page but still made me pay for what was their fault. order from someone else."
1,Amazon SNAFU,"I specifiaclly ordered the sun shade for a 2011 Ford Explorer. Amazon sent the wrong item and after talking to their customer service staff, they sent the wrong item again. Amazon finaly returned my purchase price."
1,Close but no cigar,"Pros: Works mostly as advertised, seems well constructed.Cons: Doesn't reduce volume all the way to zero (minor). Reduces separation at progressively lower levels until sound at minimum level is essentially mono (fatal)."
3,Well...it works,This splitter works just fine as a splitter but the volume control is a joke. If you turn it all the way up it is just like normal headphones...great if you just want to make something quieter.
5,an amazing watch w/an amazing price,i bought 2 of this watch at an amazing sale price and really in luv with it. just hope they won't discontinue the product coz i'll definitely buy another one.
1,I was duped,"What a waste! I was duped into buying the books in this series by reading the bogus reviews that were OBVIOUSLY posted by the authors. ""A reader"" from xxxx??? They posted nearly identical reviews for all of their books shortly after publishing them. Save your money and get something in the Made Ridiculously Simple series."
3,"IF YOU LIKE GOOD FICTION, YOU'LL LIKE THIS BOOK","I actually enjoyed reading this book but began it with the premise it was not an accurate accounting of what really went down in the 30s and 40s with regard to the Duke & Duchess of Windsor and the all-star Nazi cast of characters.Another reviewer refers to 'the letter' as 'the lynchpin' of the book. It is a letter written, the author claims, by the Duke of Windsor in German. For some reason he and his father were not sure who wrote it. Well, I am as dumb as a box of hair, but I immediately recognized the very familiar E as being that of the Duke of Windsor. How could they not? The author claims it is EP for Edward, Prince. I say it is quite clear the initials are ED for Edward, Duke.If you are so unfamiliar with the Duke that you don't even know his handwriting, how can you take the remainder of the book seriously?"
1,ALLEN'S BETRAYAL,You attempt to contribute to the cover up for Edward VIII of England.He certainly thought it more important to marry a divorced Americanthan remain King of his country in time of crisis. He also violated theintegrity the Church of England of which he was the official head andprotector.What about Lord Halifax and George VI in the early going?What about the Welsh coal miners who were already loosing too manylives because of an indifferent government and other English citizenswho were about to put their lives and honor on the line to defend Englandagainst Nazi aggression?Wendell M Kury
1,Good pro-Republican text,"As George W. Bush would say, ""a good strategery for we Republicans and their oil company donors would be to write environmentalistic books bashing widely accepted scientifical theories."" Psaeudo science at its best! A must-read for all you comedy fans."
3,Elementary Larry Wise,"An excellent introductory book but if you have been shooting for some time, you might find it too elementary. Seventy-eight pages of this book is a printed copy of the NAA or NFAA constitution and by-laws which are useless if you do not shoot in USA and also can be lifted off the internet. That said, Larry Wise is Larry Wise and he gives pieces of priceless advice for beginners"
5,Good shocks,"I was replacing the stock shocks on my Nissan Sentra SE-R Spec V. I liked the idea of the variable valving on these. It really does work. The ride is now MUCH softer than stock. I think it's smoother than my wife's 1.8S Sentra. However, at the same time it still corners almost absolutely flat. So, my handling is still there. This is great for driving around Chicago's streets.Highly recommended!"
2,Not At All A Favorite,"I purchased this workbook to learn more about the Holy Spirit and how to better welcome and be aware of the Presence of the Holy Spirit in my life.I personally don't care much for this workbook, I'm disappointed to have purchased it.I found that because I did not have the version of bible that this workbook is written with, it really made it difficult to understand and complete.It didn't keep my attention at all and it really didn't give me practical everyday things that I could apply to my life or that helped me in my spiritual growth.But if you have the version of bible that this work book was written in, you may find it helpful or useful if you are very cut and dry and don't like explinations or practical tips or anything.I personally wouldn't reccomend this for new converts."
5,great great music,"I was born in the Cape Verde Islands which is close to Senegal, I am on my late thirties, I am a music afficionado and I was surprise to never had heard about this band before. I found out about this band while researching the best genres of music on on BMG music club.In fact the lirics on some the music on Pirates Choice sounds like the dialect I speak. I agree with the other reviewers... Why this guys are not world famous? It is hard to explain how good these guys are...just buy the album. I have around 600 cds, all kind of music and Orchestra Baobab CD's are the ones I would not let anybody borrow. It is like a treasure to me."
3,A little bit detailed...,"... though a good DVD. Just wasn't the top selection out of the three bought for Christmas. Maybe if they didn't stray off the path too much, i.e. not put so much in."
4,"While I'm not an audiophile, these are very functional!","They conveniently fit in my briefcase pocket... ""whip out"" for convenient usage... and don't have a battery to drain! Wish it did double duty with my cellphone."
1,"shipment arrived promptly, but the watch is bad","shipment arrived promptly. but the watch quality is bad. After couple month, the second hand can not be reset back to 12 o'clock position anymore.This is probably my last Nautica watch."
2,"Product was OK, but Amazon over charged me by $5.49","I approved $35 for the total cost of the purchase, but my Amex was charged $40.49. The item arrived wrapped in an envelope and the box was all thorn, I was surprised to find the product still in its original sealed wrapper. I will never again purchase anything through Amazon!"
1,Tourism in shanty town,"Ideologically the opposite from a Kaurismaki film. A little tale for enjoyment of the bourgeoisie, this black comedy (that isn't so black and has only cheap humor) shows why Finnish cinema hasn't made the rounds around the world in a cloud of success. The conservative end is another sample if globalization of the invasion of mediocre ideas and self assured emptiness. How can you do a comedy about class differences without any commentary about class? How can you show differences without any relation within the two positions? Low class and middle-high class here are like two continents, like tourist destinations. The movie not only shows what criticizes but condones it. Is a movie about what the rich (filmmakers) think about the poor, but is no better than regular television at that. Maybe we must let Hollywood to do Hollywood. Bad movies are made everywhere."
5,Near perfect,"I bought this to hang in my garage and highlight my motorcycle journeys. It is near perfect: Big, shows highways, good amount of detail"
4,"Fun enough, but definitely no Harrington","While Honor Harrington is more cold and analytical, Kris Longknife is lively and adventurous. Great! They both fill a needed niche in female-driven military sci-fi.The problems tend to come not with Longknife herself, who is well-fleshed out, but everyone around her--all flat, some stereotyped. I'm not sure why someone from an Irish-Chinese planet HAS to go on and on repeatedly in casual conversation about ""his ancestors"" and the ""wee folk""; no Irish or Chinese people I know do that whether or not that's their culture and/or beliefs. All of her superiors have one mode: crush her, either career-wise or worse.All in all, Kris Longknife: Mutineer (a misnomer, taking the book as a whole and not as the last couple chapters) is a good concept, a good seed, but the fruit isn't yet ripe."
4,A Fun Quick and Entertaining Read,"I'm giving this book 4 stars. It's a hoot and I like the whole series. The Heroine is great but not TOO great; she has her flaws. Not great literature perhaps, but in its genre it's good!"
2,Almost a good book,"The story is interesting, and the world in which the story is told is interesting. I even thought that the politics that drove the world were well crafted.The characters are pretty decent as well. I'm not going to call Kris Longknife another Honor Harrington by a long shot, but there are moments where she is very likable.But the writing.... my god, the descriptive writing is weak and awkward. And the dialogue was equally awkward until I started imagining everyone talking with stiff upper crust British accents. Even then, there are a few conversations in the book (especially when the Highlanders show up) which I just could not stand to read for more than 2 minutes at a time because they were so cheesy.I might give the second book a chance to see if the writer improves any and find out where the over-all story goes... but my advice for anyone considering this book is to wait until you don't have anything better to read, and then give it a chance if you're desperate."
2,Couldnt get into this book.,"I bought this book together with Tanya Huff's ""A Confederation of Valor"" and I thoroughly enjoyed Confederation of Valor. Sadly, the same cannot be said for Kris Longknife's book.I fully admit I did not read the whole book. In fact, I only read the first fifteen pages. I just found the main character to be weak and the constant flashbacks to be, well, unconducive to good reading. I understand she's young, scared, has hangups about her history. But when she's in the middle of a mission and she's having these wimpy italised moments, I just want to roll my eyes and skip forward.There are many reviewers who did enjoy this book, and the fact that there are many more in this series shows many people out there do like this book. I'm just being honest and putting my 2 cents on the table."
4,Kudos for Kris Longknife,"Kris Longknife Mutineer by Mike Shepherd is a fun space opera adventure featuring a naval officer who is also the daughter of a highly placed politician. An ensign serving her first assignment, she has to contend with comrades who think she is a spoiled little rich girl and that she has risen not on the basis of her ability but because of who she is. This book brings the Honor Harrington and Herris Serrano books to mind-- there's nothing particularly unique in it, but it is a fun read with an exciting plot. Kris is an admirable heroine who manages to walk the fine line between honor, service and politics. Without using her familiar connections as a crutch, she does find a way to turn them into an asset for her and the other soldiers. I look forward to reading more books in the series!"
5,WHY IS THIS CD SO EXPENSIVE?,"This is Andres Calamaro's first solo album from 1984. I own this CD which I bought in Argentina about 7 years ago. It is a very good album - not the greatest I've ever heard, but very good nonetheless - and i paid about $11- in 2001 in a Buenos Aires record shop. You can get this same CD for about $7- plus shipping on eBay. Definitely the way to go! Get it. You won't regret it."
4,big boy knife,knife has a nice feel to it and holds and edge for some time without needing resharpening. I use this knife everyday. It compares to some of the more expensive knifes I own at a fraction of the cost.
5,"GEORGE KATSOULIS, PIREAS, GREECE","The best book I have read in the topic, deserving the money I spent to get it. It is a valuable reference not only for CDMA communications, but generally for any digital communications topic. The authors face the reader as a normal human being, not as a genius. They give detailed explanations for almost everything. The depth of their analysis does not mean that the book does not treat the advanced topics of CDMA. On the contrary, the authors have found the magic way to gradually present more difficult topics, familiarizing the reader with them in an excellent manner. I wish the book had 2000 pages to carry every possible aspect in digital communications. Don't miss to include it in your library."
4,It has pinecones on it!,"The picture online did not show pinecones clearly, if at all. I like the tree otherwise. I plan to just cut off the pinecones. The instructions speak of a fourth section of the tree, so it looks like the use the same instructions for different heights. Threw us off for a minute."
5,Funtime,"I Spy is one of the Best ways to spend time with your child and you both will have a great time!!! Some puzzles are alittle hard but that is all part of the FUN!!! My daughter and I love our,""Our Time"" with I Spy.We each pick an item to find and then search.If one of us can't find the item, we search for it together!!! This is a great book to send with your child to the Grandparents house."
4,Fun to turn to again and again.,"I SPY YEAR ROUND CHALLENGER is filled with 12 pictures -- one for each month. Every puzzle is very different from the others. These clever photographs have beautiful colors but they're sometimes blurry or dark and hazy, and it's hard to see what's what. I wasn't always sure what I was looking for. I even believe there's a typo, making you look for one thing when it should be something else. In a couple of cases you can see only a tiny part of the thing you're supposed to find. And the extra credit riddles need to be on a foldout page so you can refer to them without flipping back and forth. Still, it's a beautiful, clever book and a lot of fun."
3,rather difficult,This says it is for kids from age 4 but I don't think that is quite right. The pictures are blurry and the items are not easy to find. They are quite challenging puzzles and I think the over 9 age group would be more likely to enjoy them.
3,All the pictures are recycled from other books,Even though you are looking for different items. I was disappointed that it wasn't something completely new!
5,Love this product!!!,I have been using this product for over a year now and absolutely love it. In the past I have purchased other similar products but they do not compare to Bodyography. I have recommended this product to several of my friends who have also been very please with this product.ReneeTexas
1,Not a great product for acne prone or sensitive skin.,"Thought I would try this product since it is cheaper than what I usually buy. Perhaps the other users of this product do not have sensitive, break-out prone skin. I do, and my skin instantly broke out all over. Also the product flakes off of the skin when I try to apply my foundation over -- even when I wait several minutes for the primer to set. Everyone is different -- this product does not work well for me personally."
5,Super Primer,"Wonderful product, could not make your application of foundation any eaiser, your make-up glides on and it evens everything out. Will continue to purchase and always have on hand."
1,Saw does not keep running.,I have had my 359 about a year and have used it little. It is now back at my dealers for the third time because it just will not keep running. The first time he found a hole in the fuel line. It dies both while idling and while cutting and then is hard to start. I am about ready to declare it a lemon and try to get a refund.
4,Good solution for the money.,Burning stacks of discs and need storage? These big black binder will do the job at a good price. The pages are big and floppy. They nylon covers not too ridgid or too thick. Are there better quality albums out there? No doubt. Is there a cheaper way to acceptably store stacks of discs? I doubt it. This sure beats leaving them in piles all over the place.
4,"Does what it should, so far","Nice and sturdy binder, well constructed.My only qualm is that there is no handle to carry it by (as one sample photo showed), but I am sure I will work something out.And if you are picky, be aware that there are no top flaps/tabs to keep CDs/DVDs in: just a sleeve. However, those are usually a mixed bag anyhow, so no real loss.Good price for a quality binder."
2,Some Valuable Ideas but Sloppy Writing,"Herzog has some valuable ideas in The B.S factor. His best writing is when he becomes passionate about becoming a ""skeptic."" But otherwise the book looks hastily written. Many ideas are unsupported. Many conclusions are unstated, leaving the reader to wonder, ""what is his point?"""
2,tried it out,"I found this product disappointing. The material is very hard plastic which I found quite uncomfortable. It would be much better if it had softness at least to the outside material. It is also quite awkward to find the time and ""assume the position"" required to use it regularly. The concept is a good one but it would take a real commitment to see results."
1,Do you like having to fold your socks under at the toe?,"I cannot find any size for these socks in the listing. I am tired of buying socks advertised to fit any size foot from 6 to 12, and then having to fold 1 or 2 inches under at the toe in order to wear them on my size 7 1/2 foot. Since these socks have no size listed, they are apparently designed to fit ANY size foot, and thus will not give a reasonable fit to any foot smaller than about size 12. Buyer beware."
5,Panisonic Amp,"I never though panasonic was into car amps. When I first bought the amp I had it installed and it was unexpectingly really loud compared to the Fosgate that I originally had and blew. I'm very happy with my Panansonic but it seems that like it has lost a slite bit of power from when i first had it installed. It might just be that my ears have gotten use to the amp and Im going deaf lololol. But It still was a great buy. I lowered the amp cause i have gotten 2 tickets and a warning from the police lololol. So there is your proof on my expense "" IT DUMPS"". If your speakers can handle it try the amp on its highest settings you will have a cool aid smile. Just remember to keep the frequency low it will keep the bass nice and deep."
5,Good CD Wallet,"Case Logic KSW-92 CD Wallet is a very nice way to store your compact discs. On the package it says you can hold either 46 with booklets or 92 without,hopefully you don't want to store your booklets in the wallet because the CD slots are tight enough that they keep your CDs in place, but to tight for the CD booklets, and not wide enough either.I'm not worried about fitting CD booklets in the case,so your my personal use the Case Logic KSW-92 does a good job.Stores 92 CDs and isn't to bulky."
5,"Looks good, soft & supple, works terrific.","This is a nice looking case. Feels good to the touch. Has been durable for my usage.Has great storage capability. I bought several for my customers to organize their software.Excellent idea for organizational purposes, looks good, works good, great purchase."
3,Temporary Dog Sitter,"Keeps my dog mellow, but not very durable. I've had to purchase one per year because the heating element wares out."
3,Decent but not great product,You see the beagle in the picture? That might be the largest dog that can fit on this product.
3,Not my cup of tea,"God for UsThis is not my favorite praise Cd. It's heavily orchestrated with heavy choral arrangements. It also has lots of talking on it with a few testimonies, which are well done, but are not music. If you want more a church experience, then this Cd will suit you. A lot of people have really liked it, it just wasn't my cup of tea."
4,Freddy Weller CD,This CD only has one song on it I like but it was worth it. It was everything they said it would be.
2,It is TRASH!,"part of the appeal of trashy exploitation films are their ""smear"" campaigns, one-sheets full of bosomy women, firing guns, cars in collision and whatnot. On this level the book is very enjoyable -- HOWEVER, I find the grouping of the posters haphazard (what is CREATION OF THE HUMANOIDS doing in ""Groovy Trash?""), many of the posters are in poor condition and the brief introductions to each chapter are highly irritating. The author trips all over himself trying to sound clever and fails dismally. Still ... where else are you going to see a four-color poster for SIX-PACK ANNIE?"
5,The best Mendelssohn collection,"This compilation has the finest interpretations of the most-known Mendelssohn masterpieces, from the Digital recording of the Violin Concerto by the marvellous Anne-Sophie Mutter and the masterful Herbert von Karajan to the sparkling, reverberating recording of the Midsummer Night's dream conducted by Rafael Kubelik. It is a must-have. And the price is nice too!"
4,Hmmmm....,"Quite a good album, but not what I expected. Live in the Bay Area and love it when his mixes grace the radio waves, but this album doesn't include some songs it should. Listen before buying, I say."
1,too weak!,"I love house music & have always been a fan of dj's that tear it up... this c.d. is all a waste of money.It was given too much publicity for something so weak. And whats up with this guys pictures of himself and on the cover,this guy is NOT good looking so it was really not necesary!Bottom line, don't waste your money, get something good."
2,WHAT HAPPENED?,"If you've heard David Garcia's first album you'd know he's a terrrific mixer, but he did all but that on this album...with all the hype it's not what one would expect from this artist. PLEASE LISTEN BEFORE YOU BUY! If you're expecting David to grace us with anything like ...@ the club last nite(his first album)...don't hold your breath! All I can say is: WHAT HAPPENED?"
4,Rockin Mix...,"Just picked up this CD, and after listening to it, and realizing when the CD was made, David was waaaay ahead of his time. Some of the songs may be played out now, but he basically called out all of the songs that were going to be hits. I would still highly recommend picking up this CD because 5 years from now MOST of these songs will be classics, and you will regret not having them in your collection. On the other hand i agree that nothing compares to a live set from DG."
3,"Old school, very nice","I disagree with the other reviews, I found this cd used and it's now one of my favorites. it has all the classics and he does some great mixes. his version of stomp to my beat is my favorite mix of the song. I've seen him spin live and he rocks!"
1,dj david garcia at the club,I think this c- d rocks its like listening to wild 94.9 I mean wild 107.7 Its really a whole bunch of commercialized junk but the dj is a hottey...
4,Just Missed!,Well David did another great job but with all the hype it just didn't match up to his first at the club album. They both rock and hopefully David will Grace us with More.
3,"Great in rural areas, not metropolitan","This product is a great theory, and is very easy to use. Turn it on, let it find satellites, and you're off. Unfortunately, it does a very poor job of maintaining links to the satellite.If you intend to use this in an area where you do not consistently have a clear sightline to the southern sky, you'll be disappointed. It worked wonderfully traversing the countryside shooting pictures in parks and fields. However, enter a city with buildings of 2 or more stories high, and it spends a lot of time searching for satellites, and before you know it the battery is dead. We spent a long weekend in Boston, and another in Chicago. My Garmin GPS knew exactly where we were all the time, but this could only find us once every few blocks while walking the cities.If your fine with mapping your pictures in clumps every few blocks, this is for you. Until then, I'm waiting for someone else to execute this theory better."
3,GPS for cameras good but not for everyone,"In short it allows you to know where you were. It's relatively accurate. A good value for the money, the software is not as tested as it should be and there are problems. Also, the software could do more such as show a trail of where you've been.With that said, it does what it promises"
2,"Poor Battery life, Software limitted,","I was hoping for more features in software, better battery life. I found the casing to be a bit light.. Not something I would buy again."
3,Works okay,"I used it during one day of my recent Japan trip. It got signals most of the day, but the log file disappeared later in the day. I don't know if it was because the battery was running out or it started raining. I don't like how the location information can only be viewed with Sony's own Picture Motion Browser (maybe there is a way around this), which means that I cannot share the location info easily with another person. Nevertheless, seeing the location of a picture down to the street level was very satisfying."
5,What a blast to have!,"I love this thing.I travel quite a bit, and always bring my camera with me. Camera or not, it's always fun (for some reason) for a techie (nerdy) guy like me to see where i've been over the course of time.I bring this unit golfing with me all the time & simply clip it on my golf bag. Whenever I think of it, I take the log files & add them to my photos (which get uploaded to Flickr & automatically added to a map for me), as well as uploading the logs to everytrail.com.Works just as advertised, runs for quite a while on a simple AA battery, and is really easy to use.Note that you must remove the first line of the log file (just a txt file) for a lot of sites/programs to use it."
4,"Meat, Potatoes, and Salad","Sleepers is one of those books that the reader can get through very quickly. It is difficult not to become involved with the characters and with the plot. The book is well-written, and incredibly powerful. I give it four stars, not to take anything away from the book, but because I don't consider it to be a perfect book. It was quite an enjoyable read, and I definitely recommend it.I think that the question of whether or not it's an autobiographical story or not is irrelevant. I think that rather the statement it intends to make and the story it tells should be the focus. The story itself, rather than the way it was marketed. But if the controversy is going to kill you, don't bother."
3,Sleepers,"Sleepers ia a haungint, disturbing coming-of-age tale of four young boys who have to go to a juvenile prison after accidentally nearly killing a man. The controversy over whether the book is fact or fiction clouds the significance of the novel, however. As an autobiography, the book is a powerful story that both shocks the reader and causes the reader to question how such atrocities could happen. As a work of fiction, on the other hand, which is what it is generally believed to be, Sleepers loses some credibility; the author states at the beginning that the events really did happen. Nonetheless, Sleepers is a fairly suspenseful story for mature adults with strong stomachs."
3,Shades of Frey,"I agree with M. Cormier's review and believe this is partly true. It was an interesting book, well written but does not seem to be entirely true. It could be, but after James Frey's ""memoir"" all the non-fiction books I read are suspect. Non-fiction will never be the same."
3,Carcaterra dwells far too much...,"...on his past as a street punk for a guy who's pulled himself up by his bootstraps and become a succesful reporter. When Rocky Graziano told a fairly similar story in his autobiography ""Somebody Up There Likes Me"", he made it clear that he was no longer what he used to be, glad as hell of it, and felt himself blessed at the change in his life. The brutality of the guards at the reformatory is an issue that should be addressed, if only for the fact that hardened criminals often begin the ""hardening"" in just that way. But Carcaterra ain't no hood no more, he's a respected writer. The bitterness underlying this grueling tale is uncharacteristic for a successful man who has overcome quite a lot to get where he is."
1,Now that it is known to be a hoax...,"When I first read this book the question that plagued me was whether or not this was a true story. There was a lot of press dedicated to that question which only served to further hype the book. It is now known to be a work of fictionThe entire story is fabricated and I challenge all those who read it with the notion that it was true, to re-read it now. You probably won't even bother to finish it and you may even want to retract your rating. It's cliched. The ONLY compelling notion in this is that it might have been true, but now we know it was all a lie based on someone else's life (loosely) it loses any appeal.Why would Lorenzo do this? Because he couldn't sell it otherwise. He tried, but no one was interested. It has no merit so he re-submitted it as an autobigraphy.He strikes me as an opportunistic loser. I think most of his law and order scripts are pretty lame as well. The same sort of venue, though - it seems real but is all fabrication."
4,It took guts to write this book,"I admit, I first saw the movie of Sleepers before I had the true pleasure of reading this fantastic piece of work by an author who anybody must have respect for. This book wasn't just about how 4 boys were abused mentally, physically, and sexually, it is also how they bonded together in the end along with their Pastor and risked it all to save each other. That is the true meaning of this book, and to me, that is something that nobody can put a price on."
5,"YOU CAN""T OUT IT DOWN","I loved the book. Once you pick it up you will not put it down. It is a sad story of 4 boys whose friendship ran deeper than blood. Their lives were changed forever the day they played a stupid trick. This book is intence,suspencefull, thrilling, and everything else you can put in a book. You will cry, you will laugh, and you will will be happy. You may want to stop reading it in the middle but dont because they get REVENGE. I recomemed this book because it is the best."
4,Captivating-you'll have trouble putting this book down!,"Is it true or not? A compelling question that onlythe reader can answer. The story starts out in a humorous manner, but climaxes in one of the most horrifying scenes in correctional literature. The book is engaging, as the reader will easily identify with at least one of the charactars and probably several. If you can get by the gruesome scenes, you will enjoy a great read"
4,pretty good,"I have mixed feelings about this book. It was about the torture of four boys at a juvenile center and their ultimate retributionas adults when they come into contact with the guards from their pasts. I think the fact that it's a true story and the author went through so much pain to write this is enough to give it fourstars, with the only reason behind me not giving it five was thatsome parts seemed to actually drip sentiment. These kinds of books are usually not for me, but i had no problems keeping interest in this one, and i'd recommend it to most anybody."
5,AN UNFORGETTABLE STORY-A WHIZBANG OF A READ,"I heard this book rather than read it and I must say the reader is Joe Mantegna who did an outstanding job of adding to the urgency of the story. This is telling the reader the result of what happened to 3 chums living in Hell's Kitchen in N.Y. after they did an innocent prank to a street side vendor selling hot dogs and why and how it changed all of their lives. They are sent to a boy's school (as they were in the ""13"" age group)and the experience in that institution was just awful. Then the aftermath was another happenstance that leaves the reader in awe. A tragic story, but a wonderful read."
5,haunting and gripping... four lives ruined and their revenge,"This was a great book. It shows us the world that most people won't talk sbout: children being abused. It made me think of how children's innocence is so valuable, and once it's gone, how our lives change. It's poetic, emotional, and a great vision of childhood. It's the story of boys growing up in Hell's Kitchen and how childish pranks can be more than you bargained for..."
5,Heart-rending tale of lost innocence and loyalty.,"This is an incredible book; powerfully emotional and well written. Though there are many critics who claim that the events Mr. Carcaterra writes of could not have taken place we need only look at the current situations in juvie homes and prisons to see the truth of his story. Sleepers is a skillfully told story of four your boys who, like all kids, make mistakes and have to pay for them. What happens to them, the price extracted, is one of the harshest things that can happen to anyone and it shapes their lives forever after. The loyalty and friendship they have with each other changes as they grow older, but they are still loyal to one another and that is one of the most touching things about this story. If you read this book (and I strongly suggest you do) be prepared for lots of emotion, both positive and negative."
4,Very Good!,It is a good book by the way it is written but some of the details to what happened in real life were to graphic for me. But beyond the graphic parts it is an excellent book.
5,All I can say is WOW!!!!!!!!,"I was awestruck when I read this book. The words drew vivid pictures in my mind that almost made me see exactly what John Reilly,Thomas Marcano,Michael Sullivan and Lorenzo Carcaterra saw and feel everything they felt. Although no one could ever relate the book was an awesome dipiction of life in Hell's Kitchen and a wonderful portrayal or the life of four friends growing up together. This was by far the best book and will always be my favorite."
5,A true must read,A BOOK WITH A STORY AS INCREDIBLE AS SLEEPERS JUST CANNOT BE NON-FICTION. YET IT IS. THE TRUE STORY OF 4 BOYS STRUGGLE WITH MERE SURVIVAL IN HELL'S KITCHEN (A N.Y. INNER-CITY) AND A JUVENILE FACILITY. IT IS A GRIPPING TALE OF INNOCENCE LOST. OR MAYBE MORE LIKE INNOCENCE TAKEN BY THE COLD HANDS OF SOCIETY
3,too good to be true,"I ignored most of the publicity about this book when it was first released. It's a riveting read, but my first thought was ""no way is this true,"" and I'm pleased to find others questioning it as well. (Of course, many people will believe anything.) Does it matter? Yes. The first part of the book, about growing up in Hell's Kitchen, still holds up. The second part, about sexual abuse in a juvenile prison, is probably exagerrated. The third part - the revenge trial - is absurd. But without the thrid part, they never would have made it into a movie."
3,i dunno,i'd probably give this book 3.5 stars. it wasn't terrible. it was ok. i'm kinda thinking maybe i'm hating on the book cuz i'd heard it was like this great book. and it wasn't.
2,This is Fiction.,"This is an entertaining novel, but if you change the names, places, events, location, times, and characters identiites; then its called Fiction, not non-fiction. Mr. Carcartarra story has been investigated by several investigators and there are numerous holes in his story. His friend the ""Lawyer"" was interviewed and he has never taken on a murder trial and then lost it. Also, the two hoodlum friends were obviously a composite of some of the characters from the Westies gang. It would be fairly easy to spot who these people are, seeing how Organized crime is documented so extensiveley. And the ringer, the Priest. The Priest that was at the Authors school, never testified at any trial. Pure Fiction."
2,Emotionally Gripping.........no.....,"I pity the people who call this book descriptive, emotional, and what not.....i doubt the truth and wonder what other horrible crap these people are reading now a days that makes this book bring them to tears."
3,hard hitting drama,"sleepers is a book that graphically describes the beatings and rapings of four boys in a home for boys.what makes it more dramatic is that the book is a true story,told by lorenzo carcatera,one of the boys.as the kids grow up in hells kitchen,they cause trouble in their neighberhood until one day they go to far and almost kill a man.they pay for that by being sentenced in a home for boys and thats where the abuse happens.i found the book pretty boring sometimes,but you cant deny the pain that these kids went through and it makes you wonder if this could be happening in other facilities of this kind somewhere else,where kids are supposed to get help not get abused."
5,Intriging and ultimatlly amazing-the best ever,"This story was the most sad, touching, emotional book I have ever read. I could not put it down. I have no doubts that this story is true. Through the style and descriptivness, such honesty and overpowering suspense is either real or Mr. Carcaterra is a mastermine at creating such a overall touching story."
5,a fabulous story which moved me deeply,"I have to say that this is one of my favourite books. I couldn't put it down. I felt a great attachment to the four boys""lorenzo(shakes), Tommy(butter),John(the count) and Michael.This story captures the feelings and pain of the four boys made guilty from a prank which went wrong. The pain and torment they experienced changed their lives forever and mentally and physically scarred them. I have to admit this book moved me to tears more than once. I felt as if I knew each boy personally, so I felt angry at the guards who had tormented them. Even so there was still humourous and sarcastic tones in this book, which made it an extremely enjoyable read. So enjoyable that i will probably read it again!"
1,I don't think so,"What's wrong with you people? I agree with those who doubt this book's authenticity. I'm offended, actually, by what this author expects me to believe. Life just doesn't happen this way! And where are the records of this court case? (A New York news report says they don't exist.) It's a shame that this author was so desperate to become a star that he went to this length. Anytime anyone lies about child abuse, it's a crime, as I see it. You diminish its horror, somehow, for those who really *did* suffer through it. Shame on you Carcaterra. You can fool most of these people, but not me."
5,Thrilling!,"I thought it was the best book I've ever read. My class was assigned to read books during our winter vacation, and I chose to read Sleepers. My class loved the section that I read to them, and now everyone wants to borrow it! The parts were the boys were beaten and abused made me cry. My favorite part in the whole book was when Lorenzo threw the snowball at his teacher's head. I admire Lorenzo Carcaterra very much. He gives me the spirit to keep on writing. I've read the book twice already, and as soon as my friend gives it back, I'll read it again.-Stephanie M. Hooper13 yrs oldBeijing, Chin"
1,Carcaterra exposed!,"While reading Sleepers, I was both appalled by the ""real events"" that had taken place in this poor man's childhood, and confused by some of the details that I knew could not possibly happen as described. The events played out so conveniently to bring about the conclusion. There were so many flaws throughout the book that it was preposterous! I finally did a little search on the internet and discovered it's merely a work of fiction. It wouldn't have even mattered to me, except the author claimed it was all true."
3,Don't really know what to think,"I loved the movie, but a lot of the color of the characters kind of felt flat to me. Simple sentences, cliche descriptions; I was hit disappointed overall with this one."
4,"awesome, love it, read it read it read it","it was an awesome book, really sad and depressing but an awesome book!!!!! read it read it read it read it"
3,The book was ok,I saw the movie first and then decided to read the book. The book didn't add anything the movie left out. It was like reading the screenplay.
5,Im in love,"I stick with only panasonic head units. Ive went through 4 already working my way up the food chain to what I call now the most powerful, complex yet simple model. I'm all about sound and to achieve some good results this unit is the way to go."
3,tuna flakes,The flakes are so fine that when a cat sniffs them they blow away. I think a litte thicker would be better
3,Stretches out of shape with normal use,"I'm not fond of this. With normal use, it begins to stretch until it starts getting loose. It also gets dirty quickly because of the material it's made of."
5,The sounds of the Zoo haunt me!,Excellent avant garde poems written in an excellent voice. A must have!!!
1,These LEAK - Buyer Beware!!!,"I bought these in 3 colors; all of which I found leak. I found out when tucking my son into bed and noticed his sheets were glowing in certain spots. I also had one sitting on my daughter's end table which left a smudge mark. When wiping it off, I found it STRIPPED THE PAINT OFF WHERE IT LEAKED!!!Take my advice and buy either a LED glowstick for around $3, or get a glow in the dark engraved wrist band if these are for your kids."
2,Poor Quality,These scissors don't hold together well and tend to separate. You can put them back together but its a hassle that you could avoid with other scissors and they're not very sharp. Next time I'll pay more and get better quality.
3,not very comfy,It cuts OK and the fact that it comes apart to clean is nice. But the finger holes are not the least bit ergonomic. Especially uncomfortable if you're trying to cut through something thick like card board or wings from chicken....Save your money and by the Fiskars.
5,California Girl Loves Orange and Patchouli,"I love this lotion. It is very rich and moisturizes well, all day. the best thing is it does have an intense orange fragrance just like a fresh peeled orange with under tones of patchouli and it helps me feel happy yet calm when I wear it for some odd reason. The fragrance stays on all day. This is one of a few of my favorite personal care things. If you love orange and patchouli get this product!"
2,Orange-y!,"I like Lush's 'Karma' which is an orange-patchouli, but it's a bit pricey. I was hoping this might be similar. Unfortunately my experience with the jar I bought locally was an entirely (and extremely intense) orange fragrance. It's like a one-note orange fragrance. The lotion itself seemed fine. But the fragrance was just too strong and not what I was looking for. Maybe I got a bad jar, but just be warned if you are looking for a 'Karma'-like fragrance from this."
1,Heads up! Very STRONG scent.,"I received this body cream in the mail, and put it on my legs the next day after taking a shower and before heading to work. And... for the first time in over 25 years, I was asked to leave work because the scent was so strong, that my coworkers couldn't handle it. One gal even started tearing up because it was so heavily scented. It's got a heavy sweet orange scent to it. If you want to clear out a room of people, this is the product for you. Or, perhaps you want an impromptu day off of work? This is the ticket."
2,Good audio quality but a dangerous product,"This headset has good audio quality, a convenient volume control, and an adjustable mic. However this is product is dangerous. This product poses a tripping hazard waiting to happen. I mean who in the world would need 2 meters of cable to connect the headset to the computer? This headset is not recommended and needs to be redesign or else someone is going to get hurt or to say the least, have their connectors ripped out of the computer and damaged."
5,TRACK LIST,"Track Title1. Secret Garden2. Because The Night (Live)3. Pink Cadillac4. 4th Of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)"
5,Love this flaxseed!,I think this brand is the best and has never failed me in whatever I have bought from Bob's Red Mill.
5,Flaxseed,"It's very good flaxseed and a very good buy. It's whole flaxseed, so you will need to buy a coffee grinder for grinding the seeds."
5,AlC,I always buy the seed and then grind them in small quantities that way I am always eating fresh ground mill. The product is excellent and is very good on cereal. The price as compared to buying it in a store is much cheaper through Amazon. I highly recommend this product.
5,Best flaxseed,"This is such a convenient way to purchase good quality flaxseed. I coarsely grind enough for several weeks in my coffee grinder and store it in the refrigerator. It is so much better than the ground flaxseed powder that you find in the grocery stores. I have confidence in the organic product because it is produced by Bob's Red Mill. Thanks, Amazon, for having a selection of healthy foods."
3,How do you rate,How do you rate a food product that you take for nutritional purpose? You take it and hope it is doing what it says it will do. The over all service was nice. Here when they said. The seeds look healthy and grind into powder very nicely. The three stars are just because How do you rate it? It could just as well be five stars. I recommend them to every one who is looking for a healthier life style.
5,EXCEPTIONAL,"I LOVE THIS PRODUCT AND COMPANY. They are consistently good and their price is competitive and it's delivered to my door. Whole flaxseed, according to a doctor, retains it's vitamins. I use my coffee grinder to make flaxseed meal, then use it on toast, cereal and for baking. It's a wonderful way to get those needed Omega's. :-D"
5,Best I have ever had.,Great Quality. No after taste. Love it. My son even asks for these on his food. Can't find a better product on the market.
3,Just okay,"After seeing all of the great reviews I was a little dissapointed. Maybe I am just finicky, but I expected the seeds to look whole and glossy like the ones I purchase at the grocery store. These seemed to be a blend of good quality mixed with dried up disintegrated seeds. The smell was just a little off too. I ended up giving them to a coworker as I was just not that excited about eating them."
1,Too many grainy impurities,There are too many grainy impurities. Avoid this product if you were planning on grinding your own flax seeds for drinking in shakes.
4,Tastes ok. Grinds easily.,I bought this flaxseed to help improve my cholesterol (don't know yet if it did). I grind it every morning and put it on oatmeal. It doesn't change the taste much.
5,Bob' Red Mill flaxseed,This is the second time I have ordered this product. It came well packaged and all I had to do is put it in the freezer. The price is good and so is the flaxseed.
4,Good Stuff!,"I have bought flaxseed from a lot of places, but this is one of the most reasonable in terms of ease and cost. Yeah, there are occasional bits of things in with the flaxseed, but I have bought bags from other places which were far worse and, so far, Bob's Red Mill has not sold me a bag where the seeds had gone off already.Flaxseed is a wonder for digestion and generally good for you. I keep mine in the fridge and grind up a batch each week (also kept in the fridge). This reduces the chance of the oils in the flaxseed going ""off."" (I have had some which did, and if the flax tastes funny and not gently nutty, then get rid of it.) Don't buy the pre-ground stuff because it can go bad much more quickly.Bob's Flaxseed is now something I buy on a regular basis."
5,Great product,"I've started my dietary lifestyle change about 2 months ago and needed to starting eating more whole grain foods, nuts and seeds. Bob Red Mill whole raw flaxseed made these convenient for my busy life. I prefer to get my nutrients from plant sources rather than supplements so I grind about 1 cup and store in freezer and add about 2 tbs with my breakfast. I did not notice any earth in the bags so far. I highly recommend getting whole raw seeds and grind yourself and store grinded and whole seeds in freezer."
1,this burner won't format blank discs,i purchased this burner after reading the reviews and found out that it won't work with toshiba lap tops. I am currently using sonic dla from toshiba and for some reason i can't format blank discs from sonic or from the nero software supplied with this product. I wish that i could get a refund.
2,Skip this book and wait for a better effort on the topic,"This is a very interesting topic and certainly one worthy of a first class book. Unfortunately, this isn't it. The author's plan for the book seems to me to have been: ""Patch together a bunch of anecdotes and ideas and data generally on the subject"". Maybe he and his editor didn't feel like they had time to do a good job of research and analysis and present their findings and ideas in a well organized fashion.This book has some interesting things in it, but I didn't feel it came close to answering (or even clearly addressing) the title topic of ""Why Black Athletes Dominate Sports and Why We're Afraid to Talk about It"". A good book on the subject would look at the data, draw reasoned conclusions and present them along with their supporting data in a persuasive fashion. To me, this book doesn't do that. It's just not tied together well.If I were you, I'd skip this book and wait for a better effort on the topic."
2,Pretty thin soup,"And I might be a little generous with the second star.I, as a few other reviewers, note two problems off the top of the bat.One is Entine's uncritical handling of ""The Bell Curve.""Two is that he ignores the many sports that don't have a lot of black athletes.Beyond that, he gets selective within some sports that he does address, such as seeming to focus on track more, and field events less.Also, he ignored the rise of non-American white and non-black athletes in several sports in recent years.I think of the white Europeans in the NBA, and the non-black Caribbean players and a few Japanese in MLB.Finally, contrary to his claims otherwise, all too many children of all colors who are lower down the socioeconomic rungs tend to focus on sports as salvation. Unfortunately, more of these children are minorities."
1,"A poor book, written by a know nothing!","First of all race has nothing to do withathletics, unless of course you beleivethe gibberish that got know-nothings likeHoward Cosell [nee Cohen] and Jimmy 'TheGreek' fired. Secondly, the hardest sportin north America is Hockey and if blacksare supposedly so superior, why have theynot mastered it? The author is a typicalgutter-trash liberal who beleives everysterotype that washes down the gutter. Onthe other side of the pond is William Rhoden,who while bragging about black QBs, forgot tomention the CFL [11 years older than the over-rated NFL] (Oopps!) and Arena Football Leagues,which play better, faster styles of football,and black QBs have done better in those leagues.The evil of two lessors, I guess. Think what a wasteof reasources, like say, trees this book and all theones about the 'holaembellishment' are. Such a shamethat anyone may believe these tales...RevisionistRich Salzer [U.Hawai'i '84), Chesapeake, VA, USA,4-17-08."
2,Groomsman 5 Position Trimming Guide,Lousy design. It doesnt stay in place therefore risking the possibility of accidentally shaving off your sideburns or a vertical racing stripe up the side of your head. Makes for a good story but not a good haircut.
4,"Cute, amusing game",I originally bought this game for my mom to be entertained and be able to play N64 with. She is the type of person who cannot play a game using several buttons. I thought it would be perfect since you only use the joystick and push A when you decide to let go one of the bubble ball things. The game is fun to play multiplayer and there is strategy involved. I enjoy playing the game time to time but playing alone can be boring if you play too long. I still enjoy it but there is a lack of variety.
1,Love pickles but hate this!,I tried this pickling spice in a batch of pickles. I love all kinds of pickled veggies with salt and vinegar (no sweet or bread/butter) but hate the way this made my batch taste. I would NOT use this again...ever. Nasty!
4,Good mix of styles and good flow of music.,"Paul is a great worship leader. I attended a recent Maranatha praise and worship workshop with Paul and other members of the current Maranatha Praise Band, and they did several songs from this project.This project has a good mix of styles and tempos, yet has a wonderful flow from one song to another. It's recorded live, so it's not 'perfect', but the spirit of the project is really good, and the musicians and singers make this a must buy for praise and worship fans.My favorite cuts:First Love, I Have Kept The Faith (great groove and message!), Open The Eyes of My Heart, I Could Sing Of Your Love Forever"
3,So-So,"I got this hoping for the best. What I got was a workable solution, and I still dry clothes on it, however, the Legs of the T's are not long enough to put into the ground AND keep the clothesline up out so clothes don't drag on the ground. The only option is to post it low (thus letting clothes hit the ground and everyone smash their heads on it), or post it high (what I did). Posting it high leaves it vulnerable to tilting (which mine is), generally inward as the line pulls the poles together.The clothesline poles do their job. I just wish the engineer's wouldn't have been so stingy. The next time, I'm just going to grab 2 10' fence pipes, and 2 3' Tee pipes."
1,cowboys 20x30 tufted rug,"I have ordered from amazon for years and have never been disappointed. The item I received looked nothing like it was pictured online. The item I received only had the star in the center, no football, no cowboy logo. W[[ASIN:B0002IHTH2 Cowboys Northwest NFL Tufted Rug]I will keep item as it is only a week before x-mas, but very disappointed with amazon."
1,Cheap plastic,"Mine broke after 2 years of regular use. The plastic part of the handles were the part that broke so I can't salvage them. They might be inexpensive, but I have seen many other kitchen shears last much longer than just 2 years."
3,Just got them in the mail,"I am a bit disappointed that the bottle opener and screwdriver do not retract, but I haven't used them yet so I can't say if it will be an issue."
2,Disappointing,"I was looking for a good, solid pair of scissors for use in the kitchen. These are awkward, especially with the bottle opener and screwdriver tips poking out of the handles. They interfere with comfortable, ordinary cutting. Also, the blades do come apart for cleaning, but too easily. If you open the scissors in the wrong way, they fall apart in your hands. I don't recommend these."
2,Not so much...,"These were great when we first got them but after a couple of years, the take apart center has worn down so they are no longer tight enough to cut properly. If you only need them for a couple of years, they are great. Otherwise, not so much."
2,Reasonable ... if you don't open them too far,"They work okay as scissors if you think carefully, but I hate them: if you open the blades too far, the thing falls apart and you suddenly end up with a poor hold of two knife-like things instead. If you have the habit of sometimes using scissors for scoring where at some point during your cutting task you fully open them and just use one of the sides to score a line, these things are frustrating at best and dangerously unusable at worst. Some mechanism that didn't have them come apart during what for me is a typical use case for normal scissors would be a great improvement. Unfortunately, decades of use of scissors that actually stay together has made it impossible for me to not occasionally get a nasty surprise from absent-mindedly opening them too far without thinking what's about to happen next, and I certainly have to remember to warn guests of this ""feature""."
1,Beware!,These fell apart in my hand the third time I used them. Maybe it's a case of getting what you pay for?
3,Useful collection,Good for cutting fish bone or chicken. To me grip is not very comfortable while applying force.
4,I like these but....,"What I like:1. comes apart for easier cleaning2. reassembles easily3. Sharp Sharp Sharp!What I don't like:Mine is less than a year old and has rust spots on the blades. Now this may be my fault for putting it in the dishwasher... but I don't think it should rust, should it?Over all I like them because it wasn't like they were that expensive, and for what I use mine for a little rust is no big deal."
5,Does the Job and Tastes Great,Can't find anything to complain about with this product. Tastes better than I thought it would and seems to be doing the job.
5,more energy,"I actually did notice I have more energy after about 2-3 weeks of taking the liquid vitamin. I love it, I feel great, I have already ordered another bottle. Works great for my lap band as well. Pills get stuck and I haven't found a liquid vitamin that works this well."
2,Nutritional,"This product didn't fair too well as expected. Although the taste is exceptional, results might require long term use.Have two bottles where one is almost empty. Let us see."
2,NOT for XBOX 360,I am not sure if the game is any good or not. Could never get it to play because it is an XBox original game. There are several hundred games that can be played with an update found on the xbox website but this is not one of the games. Will try to return.
2,Not too great,"I had high hopes for this game but they were ill-placed. The graphics are reallly good but that's about it. The gameplay is almost boring. It's not really exciting either to play. The cutscenes are pretty good though, but that's it. It was pretty much a waste of money. Save your money and get NFSU or something. I do not recommend LA Rush."
2,DON'T BELIEVE IT!!!,"After reading the stellar review from another Amazon member I decided to purchase this album. The music is great and after listening to the cd for about a few solid weeks I decided that I needed to get out and slam dunk some hoes myself.I got beat up, raped, and arrested. I mean, the music is good and all, but don't believe everything you read - this cd will not make you a pimp."
5,Extremely good drama,"I came upon this series totally by accident. British television seems to be producing the only thought provoking drama these days. Foyle's War is subtle yet projects the complications of WWII without over simplifying. Detective Foyle is a man of high principles and a strong sense of right and wrong. There are even religious overtones in the episodes I've watched so far and shows the hideous, sometimes subvertly evil intentions of those who would sympathize with the Nazi invaders of London. Foyle stands his grounds on his principles as he goes about his detective work never wavering in his solid belief that what Germany is up to in WWII is nothing but evil. The drama is so understated yet poignant. This is what I love about British TV. You'll be riveted."
1,Blowout City,"Bought these at the beginning of this season. After less than 100 miles, the front tire blew out while the bike was hung on a rack - not even riding it. Tire was flat, sidewall was blown out. I checked my pump to make sure the tire wasn't overinflated - it wasn't. I figured anyone can have a defective tire, so I bought another. Last week, while riding on smooth pavement, the rear tire (with about 500 miles on it) blew out. Same thing as the first tire - sidewall tore. Tire says minimum pressure should be 100 psi, max. 145 psi. I inflated to 120 psi before the ride. Needless to say, no more of these for me. Spending $150 for three tires to ride a total of 500 miles is pretty pathetic."
2,Not for every day riding,"I recently bought a bike that had a brand new set of these tires on them. After a few months of just daily commuting, both of them popped. My front tire in particular was pierced by a tiny pebble leaving it completely useless. Perhaps the performance is good on them, but don't plan on using them on a regular basis."
1,Weak Seller Followup,"I received these tires about two weeks ago, and during the last week, I developed two flats on the same tire on two consecutive rides. I've probably put less than 200 miles on these tires, so it does not make sense. It seems like the sidewall on the rear tire is failing or defective. I sent an email through amazon which should have made it to the seller, but I have not heard anything. I also called the seller, Bike Somewhere, left a message, and no call back.Right now - I'm not happy with this purchase and feel that I should have gone to the LBS."
4,The Maazel is the reason I bought it!,"The rest of the issue is fabulous, but the Maazel recording of the fifth symphony is simply definitive. Wonderful playing and a sympathy for romanticism in the conducting brings out every last bit of pathos in the third and fourth movements. And that's what you want, right? Pathos? I mean, we're listening to a Soviet composer. So - over the expressive Rostrapovich, the impressively technical Szell, and the expository Tilson-Thomas - this is the one to have. The one that blends all these attributes together, revealing Prokofiev's Fifth Symphony as one of the finest in the genre. Buy it now."
5,a wonderful book,"I believe the ""PUP"" is a perfect primer to how Baha'is view the world and how each person can further the maturation of mankind, and indeed envision the concept of true world peace. I recommend Promulgation of Universal Peace to anyone who asks, ""So, what do Baha'is BELIEVE?"" No one person could answer that question more clearly for us than 'Abdul-Baha, the eldest Son of Baha'u'llah, the Founder of the Baha'i Faith."
4,Great in addition to more detailed baby book,"My sister-in-law bought this for me and I thought it was cheesy at first. It is hard, if not impossible, to find the perfect baby book where you can fill in details AND has enough space for pictures. Most books only have the question prompts, which can be fun but that's all you are left with when they grow up. This book is a perfect companion to a regular baby book. I put 6 small pictures on the pages facing where you describe what they did each month. It turned out great and I get so many complements on it. There are also pages for special occassions, a growth chart, tooth-loss chart, 1st birthday, and a page for milestone like crawling, 1st haircut, laughing, etc. The page facing the milestones page is blank so you can write in others. I am buying another one for my 2nd child."
3,A Beginers book.,"I did not read the review before I bought it and that might be the reason I'm some what disappointed with this book. It is like the many other books about tea in my book shelf; a book for beginners. It has the ""mandatory"" sections that all beginner tea books has. Tea History and Walk through of a Tea gathering. This is fine but it does not have the more advanced sections.With this title I had hoped for a more spiritual book, a more advanced book. It is little that separate it from the many other books about tea in English. Except maybe that it is one of the thinner books.Having said that it is easy to read, and I hope the author would with his Tea and Buddhist experience write a more advanced book about tea in the future."
3,Common Sense with a positive attitude,"I'm definitely over 40 with a body that is changing in directions that don't necessarily please me. I also work full time and have two teenagers in the house. Believe me there is little time to focus on fashion! What I liked about the book was the author's very positive slant on being over 40. She is realistic in expressing the thoughts and confusions of this decade -- especially insofar as looking one's best. What was less than favorable was the assumption that the reader has plenty of disposable income and a lot of time on her hands (neither of which is true in my life and in the lives of my co-workers). Many of the ""hints"" were really rather common sense ideas. Other hints required money and time to truely pull off. Overall, I'd recommend the book beccause I liked the portrayal of the 40+ year old woman. I'd think twice about suggesting it to someone who wants to get fashion savvy but has little extra money or time."
1,40 Things NO Woman (40 or not) Needs to Know,"Save your money: you deserve better advice than being told to ""pull up your bra straps and loosen your belt to look thinner."" This book contains vague, tired ""tips"" with no real body type in mind, all the while telling you to love yourself just as you are--yes, we all need to hear that, but aren't you searching for advice to improve your appearance? Why else look at this book such as this?Here's a REAL tip: try The Pocket Stylist for truly specific wardrobe help, or A Guide to Elegance to achieve that chic we 40+ women quest after.I'm immediately selling my copy of 40 Over 40, if someone is gullible enough to buy it."
2,We're Not All Frumps at Forty,"I am sorry, I did not like this book. It just wasn't for me. I do not have any of the problems it addresses. However I think it would be helpful for women who do. It made it sound like we all turn into frumps at forty."
2,"eh, not so great",I was disappointed in this book. I was hoping that there would be more practical advice. What I got from the book was a lot of rambling about nothing. Sorry
1,not worth the paper it is written on,This is a total waste of money. She simply rehashs old advice. It might be useful if you have never read any clothing advice books before. It has no photos. How can a book pretend to be giving useful advice if there are no photos to demonstrate what is meant? Save your money. Go buy a new pair of shoes.
2,not all 40 things are useful,"I was disappointed with this book. It did not consistently tell you what to do and the needed details of how to do it; sometimes the directions about how to do it were there and sometimes not. I felt this book did not receive, prior to publishing, a proper editorial review. A careful reading would have given the author feedback which could have greatly improved the book. Or if not improved the book at least gotten rid of the obvious errors. For example here is a sentence taken from page 127: ""Staring into the mirror, I can see that I'm still my basic shape, just a little thicker--expect (sic.) for my eyebrows."" This is just one example of how the book seems to be thrown together--not as well put together as the author claims to be able to do with a person's wardrobe.Perhaps this may seem a bit harsh, but I really felt I was ripped off."
1,40 Ways to say Love Your Aging Body,"What I expected was an illustrated guide to dressing and looking better. The book redundantly tells the reader, over and over again, to get comfortable with your body, spend time throwing out old or stained clothes, yada yada yada, chapter after chapter. Tune into TLC to watch What Not to Wear for lots more practical advice. Better to save your $ ."
1,Wasn't looking for a self-help guide.,"The author implies that all women over 40 are overweight, frumpy, and in need of an injection of self-esteem. Thankfully, this is not the case, and the rest of us are perhaps looking for style guidance (how to look sexy and chic without dressing like a 20-year-old), not a personal cheerleading section. Then there are her practical tips: Wear clothes that match your hair color? Throw a nice trench over your rumpled house clothes if you have to step out? Don't feel guilty about pampering yourself? For any woman even remotely self-aware and style conscious, this guide will be useless -- unless she can find the humor in it."
1,40 Things you already know about getting dressed,"Fortunately I picked this book up at the library because I would hate to have spent money on it. Over half of the book was dedicated to ""feel good about yourself"" mumbo jumbo. The author was clearly coming out of a divorce and I would suspect going to therapy? Love yourself, love the clothes you wear!! She even included a chapter on dressing for a divorce, but none on how to dress for a marriage. Or work. Or shopping. Or for soccer games. Or church. There was little if any specific wardrobe advice. The publication date listed as 1999 yet there was no reference to on-line resources. If you are reeling from a divorce and have never heard the idea ""love yourself"" then this might be a helpful resource."
3,It Brings Recessed Revelations to the Forefront,"The book's okay; it brings those things that have been placed on a shelf in your memory bank back to the forefront of your thoughts. Yes, most of us know how to wear complimentary colors, to get rid of old clothes that don't fit, etc., but judging from what I've seen of late, most aren't practitioners of good, sensible taste and most seem age inappropriate. If you're looking for a book telling you exactly HOW to dress your figure, this isn't the book for you; however, if you're looking for someone to help you to remember how great you are, or to teach you that you have more self worth than you've probably forgotten you have (because after 40, I know I forgot I was a ""woman""---my clothes were largely utilitarian), and you want to look like the classic woman that you know you are inside, then get this book...it's worth the investment."
1,Thank goodness for the Library!,"This book has a ""chatty"" style that I don't care for. It was annoying to try and winnow through, so it has gone immediately back to the library."
1,Huge waste of time and money!,Nothing new in this book! As other reviewers have said - a lot of rambling away from the topic of dressing to self esteem issues. If I want a self help book on that I will buy one. I thought this would give me specific fashion advice for the over 40 set. I like Stacy and Clinton's book much better!
3,They must be getting lazy,The guys at midway must be getting lazy. This collection only has 8 games and only 2 of them are any good except one is unplayable due to some very nasty bugs. The main reason I bought this game is for off road thunder and hydro thunder however hydro thunder is unplayable because there are 2 really bad bugs the main bug is that when you finish a race 95% of the time the game freezes during the loading screen! and if your lucky enough to not have the game freeze if you unlock more stages the game will not save the unlocked stages when you exit the game! the game has an autosave feature but it does not work. and even if you manualy save it still does not work! hydro thunder appears to be the only game in this collection with this problem. anyways just wanted to let you know incase you were thinking about buying this game.
1,"Pure Evil, Incarnate.","Avoid this hemorrhoid. You gotta have a serious need for a nostalgia-fix to enjoy this game... There are only 2 mildly fun games in this collection; One is a 4x4 trucks racer that has all kinds of jumps and stuff,(but it's out-dated and lame compared to all the decent stuff available for your xbox like Burnout 3 & 4 and Midnight Club 3 dub edition remix and good old Rally Sport Challenge 2), and there is a boat racer here that is sort of okay also, but these 2 games don't make it worth while. The graphics suck throughout, trust me... A couple of those old school racers where you are looking down on a track trying to steer little cars around are here. Always HATED those... This disc is only for engineering students researching a term paper on video game history or something, not for playing... I wish I had read this review before I bought it."
3,Typical of the Genre,"Typical historical gothic fiction: creaky plot, slow moving, melodramatic posturing, and, for all this, compelling.If you like historical gothic then you'll enjoy this."
4,"Very long, VERY goth","Let's dispense with the formalities. Melmoth the Wanderer is a really long, really verbose book. However, it is a MASTERPIECE of gothic literature. Its best parts (and there are many) surpass Poe's nightmarish tales for sheer paranoia and fear, but the inordinate amount of time Maturin takes to reach the next denoument in the story took away from my overall perception of the novel. Very long, and gothic to the point of absurdity. (you'll love it!)"
1,Very basic,Be aware that this book is written for the high school student. This is not useful for anyone outside the high school classroom.
2,Third-party L.A.M.E. encoder users watch out!,"Picked one of these up as a bit of retail therapy (impressed by the price), and quickly regretted it. Read the part in the description about ""supports MP3 bit rates of 32, 64, 96, 128, 192, and 256 Kbps"" carefully... it skips and pops if you present it with 320kbps, and also possibly with 224kbps, which you will frequently find in a L.A.M.E. -encoded (""--preset standard"") mp3.Everything else worked flawlessly on this unit, which I can't actually say about some other MP3 boomboxes I tried out... If only it could play ALL the mp3 bitrates... I'd happily pay 1.5-2x the cost for a unit that could play the MP3 CDRWs without the skipping or other problems!Unfortunately, this one will be going back, and the hunt will go on...[I'm also curious as to why Amazon felt they had to remove the name of the MP3 encoding software I use - it's a recursive acronym for 'L A M E Ain't an MP3 Encoder.' Perhaps they'll see this and leave it where it belongs this time.]"
1,"Static, Motor sound, returns, headaches!","I purchased one of these on ebay. When it arrived, you could clearly hear the sound of the motor through the speakers (if you turn down the volume to zero, only the motor sound is left and it's QUITE loud. I complained and sent it back. They sent another. This time it not only has the SAME motor sound but ALSO static in the left speaker. This product is complete garbage, I've had two of them and they were both broken in the same way!I don't know what causes the static. It sounds a little like the clipping you hear when an amplifier can't deal with the dynamic range of a song (the static is in the loud, exciting parts of music.) I would encourage EVERYONE to stay as far away from this product as possible. I'm sending this one back for a refund!"
3,Maybe...,I dont know...to much money for a zelda sword that is excactly like the one i bought.It was only 22.99 and is excactly the same...man.
4,A definate Replica,"Definatly a show-off sword then an actually use sword. The egdes are NOT sharp and point is a wee bit. If you are expecting the sheathe that comes with it a replica, too, well its not. The sword is ALOT bigger than you would think the master sword should be... more like the Goron sword to me. For all you Zelda fans its a neat buy but only for showing to other friends and yourself and if your okay with that then go for it!"
2,Uh... no,"This seems to be a pretty low-quality item. I love Zelda, for certain. But, it seems that it is more of a toy sword than a replica of any kind. Unless I missed something and Link's sword really did have a plastic handle."
5,Great Edition for Performer,"As a performer, the most important asset of a score is legibility and freedom from errors. This PV is superb in that it is very legible and corrects errors from prior PV's. It is also inexpensive enough that a performer need not fear guilty about writing in the margins or breaking the binding. While not a critical edition, it has everything that a performer would want in a PV, and I would unhesitatingly recommend it over ANY other PV presently on the market, even those which have been ""authenticated""."
5,Mikado Vocal Score,"This is exactly what I needed! My son is preforming in The Mikado in the Fall and wanted to start practicing early, since he has a lead role. This is the complete score with piano accompaniment, including all spoken dialogue. Perfect!"
4,The Mikado Vocal Score (Dover Vocal Scores),Great for learning both dialogue and vocal score for anyone who is taking part in this production or who is just considering auditioning.
3,good overall to get feet wet,"I think the title is enough to give this review. It has just enough information to get your started on all the pitfalls, strategies, tips for purchasing an investment property."
4,Great Info to Get Started,"This book is very thorough in it's presentation of information. If you are a seasoned investor, it may be too basic for you. The great thing about his books is that he never includes any flashy chapter titles that promise you will get rich and is quick to point out the time and energy involved to get into the business of real estate investing. If you are thinking about investing in real estate or want some information on the topic, it is a great read."
5,Awesome,"If Eric Clapton came out with a breakfast cereal called ""Layl-os"" I would eat it every day!If anyone could do Stevie Wonder justice with a cover, Eric has done it!"
5,Powerful steps to a powerful change in one's life!,"After reading, re-reading, and doing the exercises in ""12 Secrets for Manifesting Your Vision, Inspiration & Purpose,"" I have come to the full realization of just how powerful my thoughts about myself influence who I am. My thoughts originate in the realm of where feelings of inner peace reside. Thanks to Dr. Bellamy and his powerful book, I now operate from unconditional love. Read this book, learn how to operate from your soul within, learn to quickly remove yourself from energy fields that violate your inner principles, and live each moment free, light and loving!"
5,Inspires clarity of purpose and vision,"After reading many reviews of ""12 Secrets"" I wanted to read this book but none of the reviews prepared me for the power and beauty of Dr. Richard Bellamy's words. It is THE book I needed to read now! Each time I read a little I have found myself deeply inspired, with a clearer view of my life. My husband is concurrently reading the book. He commented this morning ""There are many hard truths in the book and they hit you between the eyes, but you know that they are true."""
5,The best book that I have read on finding your purpose.,"12 Secrets is the best book that I have found on the subject of finding your life purpose/mission. Dr. Bellamy's book is NOT a passive read! If you want to fully profit from his findings and work be prepared to complete the exercises this book contains. After reading 12 Secrets and doing the exercises I am much more focused on what I should be doing with my life. It is well worth the time that you invest in reading and doing the exercises. When you finish with 12 Secrets you will not be the same person you were when you began this journey. You will have a completly different perspective towards life. No longer will you be content to go out on ""Tangents"". When you embark on a project you will know that it will either be serving or dis-serving your purpose."
3,Love the diapers but won't buy from Amazon again,"I had bought these diapers from Amazon three times before and received the correct product. But this last time, I didn't get the Huggies with triple protection leak barrier and absorbant gel. I received an older model of Huggies with ""Gigglastic waistband"" that isn't as absorbent and leak all the time. While I love the Huggies with triple protection and absorbent gel, I'm upset with Amazon's bait and switch and will never buy diapers from Amazon again."
3,Great Picture- Not so good for the long haul,"I just returned my second projector in 6 months. I replaced my TV with this projector & have loved the larger than life images and great quality. Unfortunately, the DLP light only lasts about 3 months of 2-3 hours of TV a day. The replacement bulbs are expensive at over $300.00 each on-line. If you don't mind replacing the bulb every three months & the cost that goes along with it, it's a great projector."
1,Vastly overpriced !,Vastly overpriced ! Thought I was getting at least 5 pieces in 1 package. Lots less than the ONE grounding wire I received.
5,BIG BIG SATISFACTION,"I PREVIOUSLY WROTE A NEGATIVE RESPONCE AND I WAS VERY WRONG TO DO SO. PLEASE FORGIVE AND ACCEPT MY APPOLOGIES.THE BOOK WAS RECEIVED, AND NOW I KNOW IT WAS A VERY TIMELY DELIVERY AND IN EXCELLENT CONDITION. My neighbor had picked it up when I wasn't home and then was unable to tell me for quite some time. BOOK RECEIVED AND EXCELLENT CONDITION. THANK YOU FIDDLEHEAD BOOKS"
5,Love this book!,"I remember reading Koko's Kitten when I was little, and am very excited to give a copy to my little niece. This is a great story."
2,Can't write on product.,This transparency roll material cannot be written on. The ink disappears on the roll instead of staying bold. I have tried all kinds of different markers and none seem to hold the ink. I would not purchase this material again.
3,"apparently, the last one in the world",I'm just glad they had this item - it doesn't seem to be made at all any more. It's not exactly the type of acetate I like - but it's better than nothing.
5,Gracias a Gutierrez - Alea y a Tabío!!,"Quien conozca filmografía cubana sabrá que esta película constituye un hito en la historia del Cine cubano!! Yo la llamaría un clásico, con el respeto de los entendidos en la materia. Por eso la compré y por eso recomiendo a todos que no pierdan la oportunidad de adquirirla!!. Después de ""Fresa y Chocolate"" las personas en Cuba comenzaron a ver y a tratar a la comunidad gay de una manera menos antipática y retrógada: utilizando un excelente sentido del humor, los directores, pusieron en tela de juicio el verdadero amor por la patria: quién amaba más a Cuba: ""el gay progresista y rebelde"" o ""el macho rojo aferrado a lo estipulado""??. Esta historia no puede faltar en ninguna colección personal de cine cubano o latinoamericano!!"
2,Corny stories...,This book is filled of the kind of little life stories that your grandmother would tell you. Realy hokey and not very interesting.
5,Great book with a deep quest and interesting characters,"I've been a huge fan of fantasy RPG games, including various D&D; titles for quite a while. I picked up a collectors edition of Pool of Radiance: ROMD that had the pc game, some accessories and the novel by Carrie Bebris. I finished the game first and then decided to read the novel. Having played the game definitely added to the excitment of reading the book. Many of the big events coincide and enjoying the game allowed me to enjoy the book just as much, if not more.The characters are very well developed and the setting/ scenery is well written. It was pretty much great from start to finish and I highly recommend this book to a fantasy novel or Forgotten Realms fan! It made me want to hop back into the PC game and play it more, even after beating it."
4,The original K-Pax story,"Did you see K-Pax? Well, that is the plagiarism Hollywood version of this argentine film.Hombre Mirando al Sudeste (Man Looking Southeast) is a very recommended film"
1,Not all change is good,"I wasted $34 bucks ordering this PPV, and let me tell you that bringing in Hogan was the BIGGEST mistake TNA Wrestling can make. They brought in Hogan thinking that he is the answer, when he's not. He's on of the guys that Killed WCW, and once he came in along came all the wcw guys who killed wcw..I am big WWE fan, but I liked TNA because some of their stuff WAS better then WWE.. So I watched this PPV wondering how much change hogan was bringing... let me just say.. 5 minutes in.. I didn't know if I was watching TNA or WCW...this dvd is not worth anything. its bad."
2,George Foreman 21-Inch Griddle,The griddle was badly scratched during manufacture both on the upper and lower surfaces. A non-stick coating had then been applied to the scratches on the upper surface of the griddle. This product was sent via Amazon from Target. I am disappointed that I received a damaged product and feel wary of buying from the internet again.
5,Excellent text book on wireless CDMA technology.,Mr. Yang does an excellent job of explaining the principles of a very complicated wireless technology. This book is highly recommended for those who want to understand CDMA technology.
2,misinformed and misleading,"This documentary would be a joke if it weren't about such an important topic. First of all, it is created by someone who clearly hates Christianity and is willing to use bogus ""facts"" and faulty reasoning in order to try to show that Jesus did not exist.For example, the documentary argues that the stories of Jesus were pulled from Greco-Roman mystery religions, without acknowledging--as most scholars do--that those religions just as likely pulled from the Christian stories as well. This documentary also focuses only on ignorant evangelical Christians without consulting the thousands of Christians with Phds who DO know about the origins of their faith.Save your money and don't let the wool be pulled over your eyes--STAY AWAY FROM THIS PIECE OF EMPTY PROPAGANDA."
1,good grief,"Like it was said before...if you dont believe in God, just save your money becaus ehtis movie is just stupid. If your a christian, just save your money because this movie is stupid."
1,Regret Buying,"First, I did not care for the way the Branch Davidians were referred to as crispy critters, very crude. Next, the director has an ax to grind with anything to do with religion, and that was the biggest turn off for me."
1,Do your research.,"This isn't very scholarly. Also, if you want the other side, with non-scholarly arguments (though well thought-out, probably better than this movie), read Mere Christianity by C.S. Lewis. After all, he's the opposite of Flemming (atheist-->Christian)."
2,"I already believed the thesis of this movie, but it still didn't convince me!","Frankly, this movie was a bit of a disappointment. You know the old saying, if you shoot the king, you'd better not miss? Well, if you want to question whether Jesus was the Christ or not, you'd better make a better case for it than this.This movie showed some old, white men saying that Jesus really existed. Then it showed some old, white men saying that no, he didn't. Guys, just repeating ""did not--did too!"" over and over isn't an argument!! Show us how to build the case! Show us how historians marshal and sift evidence to prove whether or not somebody actually lived or was mythological.However, the DVD wasn't a total loss. The extra features showing extended interviews are really cool. What made the DVD worth the purchase for me was the extended interview which mentioned the theory of ""fecund universes"" (google for it if you are into the anthropological argument and stuff like that)."
1,A Waste of Time and Money,This documentary was an unsupported opinion and pure speculation. Bad excerpts from movies was the bulk of the film. It was overpriced and it went in the trash right after viewing. I felt taken!
1,Zeitgeist the movie is FAR better!,"Zeitgeist the movie is far better than this confusing thing. Like me, You will learn nothing from this...except that you shouldn't have wasted your money.Is there anything lower than 1 star?"
4,"Good, interesting, well done","I enjoyed this; nice presentation; done with a sense of humor; probably preaching to the um... choir, but still, a nice piece for people who think, question, are skeptical of their Christian upbringing and would like to know 'they're not alone'. I especially enjoyed the archive film footage. There could have been a lot more on the early history of Christianity, the huge variety of interpretations that fought for primacy in the early centuries just after the Jesus story got going, ie. Gnostics, etc. -- but I also understand this was a more personal exploration for a previously Fundamental Christian who had the brains and bravery to question the B.S. and get the h**l out. Overall: a pretty fun, interesting, entertaining ride."
3,Worth seeing but only a start,"The narration was very good, explanations of the early development of christianity and its possible origins to previous myths along with effects and music made this worth watching. The interview with the new principal of the Evangelical Christian school he previously attended was relatively weak and he did not seem fully prepared for the interview. However, this documentary conveys only the ""tip of the iceberg"" of the mountain of evidence that the new testament is merely a myth, which was promoted further later by governments who saw an opportunity to create it to use as a tool for power over the masses. Nonetheless, Christians and non Christians alike should watch this documentary, if for no other reason, to begin the process of understanding what and why the believe what they believe. Suggest not to believe blindly using the excuse of ""faith"" only."
4,short but concise,"a wonderful documentary asking some very basic questions that most christians will fail to answer. if you grew up christian, you owe it to yourself to watch this video and see how much you actually know about your religion. shorter than i expected in length, it ended just as it was picking up steam."
3,Two disjoint stories,"The author/editor does a good job for the first 80% of the movie. The title describes that part well.Then, in the last 20%, which should have been a climax, a denouement, and a conclusion, it swerves violently into the land of autobiography.In creative writing, the last words of the sentence set the tone of the entire sentence. (""In creative writing, the tone of a sentence is determined by the words that come last."") It's the same in cinema, where the last tiny moment of a movie sets how we evaluate, summarize, and remember the movie.In this documentary, the author's own conflict is not nearly as important as the first 80% of the movie, and in using his story to punctuate the sentence, the story seems like a personal spat, only the size of a few men.This is a great documentary, as long as you skip the last 20%, which serves only to drag it down into the realm of the mundane."
1,Reverse Witch Hunting.,I was very exited to see this but was quite sorely disapointed; Visually it's very amaturish (bad design and animation) which partly explained to me why it was never aired on any channel. I also feel that in the end (not the actual end of the film) his argument falls flat and he's really just an angry ex-believer who wants revenge. The angle he takes on the bible is quite childish and one sided; always making fun of it and not giving the viewer a sense of objectivity.
1,Does more harm than good,"I'm all for demystifying religious beliefs and moving to a more secular society. This movie, however, is not useful to that end. It's a confusing, poorly produced, plotless mess. The production quality really is appalling and asking $20 for 60 minutes of amateur photography and special effects is ridiculous. What interesting ideas the filmmaker has are lost in overly long attempts at snide, Michael Moore style ribbing culminating in the self-indulgent non-sequitur where he returns to the Christian school in which he was brought up. The movie has no point, no focus and no sincere attempts at revelation or education. At best, it belongs on Youtube. Don't waste your money."
1,Ignorant at best.,"This DVD is poorly done in every way. Between misquoting and taking scripture completely out of context, interviewing (on both sides) people who are not intelligent about what they are saying, and the goofy takes from old movies, this meager documentary shouldn't be taken too seriously by anyone...whether they agree or disagree with the conclusions put forth."
1,Waste of time,"I was hoping for some well argued criticisms of the historical Jesus but this director clearly has issues with his past but I dont think he gets the cathartic reaction he was looking for. I think it's healthy to question ones faith or lack thereof but this was mere pandering. The historians/researchers are hardly groundbreaking in terms of denouncing theology and history but there are no credible pro-Jesus speakers, only random Christians who are ""put on the spot"". Why not have Christian theologians and historians rebut your ""experts"" claims? And what was the point of ranting against ""Passion of the Christ"" movie? It's hardly a historical document. It's a directors version of events based on source material. If Mel Gibson chose to make it bloodier, that's his business. The directors timeline of early Christianity is murky because he totally avoids the writings of Peter that occurred as a contemporary of Paul. I was not impressed."
1,What a joke...,"Don't waste your time if you are looking for a un-biased documentary. The producer / narrator of this movie takes scripture completely out of context in the most pathetic agenda driven of way. His dogma against and hatred of Christianity is as virulent and blind as any fundamentalist religious zealot is for Christianity. I waited forever to see an unbiased historical representation of the Christian religion and all I saw was a damaged man's diatribe full of lies and half truths and agenda driven drivel. The few scenes about ancient religions being the same as the Christ story were barely covered and nothing new from 100's of other books / movies in this milieu. His religion of hating religion is boooooring - and the attempt at the musical score making some emotional statement was hackneyed at best. The absolute JOKE of it all was his ""dramatic"" denial of the Holy Spirit in the chapel he attended as a boy... lame. If he has a therapist he should fire him immediately."
1,Dissapointing,"Although I completely agree with the content, the film itself is very amateur-ish, overly snarky and lacks any sort of coherent structure. Don't waste your money on this DVD."
3,message great...messenger less great,"If not for the fact that I so agree with the premise of this film and with the sentiments expressed, I may have given the film but two stars on its merit alone. I am a huge Richard Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens and Sam Harris fan where their writings on the evils of religion are concerned. I hope more films like this one are made by others with a more apt hand. This film, though in allignment with my anti-theist beliefs was, as has been stated by others, somewhat amateurish and narrowly focused on one guy's issues with faith as opposed to the global horror religion spews so well. I would say, if you are building a library on the topic as I am, then go ahead and buy it. It will not however be the source of your strongest arguments against that dogma which it condemns to its credit. I suggest by the way going to google videos to view ""The Root of all Evil?"" by Richard Dawkins, for free. This is a wonderful and more able look at the same question of religion."
2,Home made - nothing new - boring stuff,"I waited nearly one month for this DVD, sat down on a Saturday evening, and was totally bored. It last's a mere 62 mins, and has nothing more than a local man, trying to prove his point.He exposes some uneducated christians, which i all fairness is not hard to do these days. He jabs the church as dogmatic, which is a general normal understanding in group consciouness nowadays.Its 62 mins of a local man backtracking to his childhood, done in a rather amateur way. Far be it for me to criticise, however if your looking for an honest opinion, then this DVD is wasting your money.Being an amateur movie maker myself, had we made this, then it would be considered a ""freebie""DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY"
3,Amateur,"This documentary isn't very good. It doesn't flow. Peter Joseph did a way better job with his first Zeitgeist movie. If you are really interested in the subject read: ""Christ in Egypt: The Horus-Jesus Connection by D. M. Murdock and Acharya S."""
3,Good if you are not an atheist for too long,"Yeah, I know a movie cannot be to informative without being too boring but I think this movie doesn't give enough time whenever it says something, everything is too fast and the things that are slow are personal to the maker of the movie.The interviews are....mmmm...unfair?, I don't know, they don't feel right.I am an atheist, if you have been for long time and interested in these subjects, buy it like a donation (which I did) but not because it is good.Movie makers need to know that any graphic that you see in a computer doesn't look the same in standard television, unless it is HD."
3,made for athiests,If you are a non believer you will just get a few laughs out of this vid and maybe learn a thing or two .....maybe.If you are a Christian ....you will most likely be offended ....nothing wrong with offending Christians but I would have rather seen this vid taken a more seriouse path.3 stars is enough ....and I am an Atheist
5,Great for the person who is unsure about his/her faith.,"This movie makes you feel compfortable with not believing. Trust me, your not going to hell if you don't believe in jesus."
1,High School Project At Best,"As an atheist, I should have been an easy audience. However, the editing, production, music, graphics and overall approach to questioning Gods existence was poorly presented at best. Believers will give this movie a negative review, non-believers will generally provide a positive review, and people who appreciate a professionally produced documentary will do what I did, watch it and then throw it in the trash (literally). I was hoping to pass this film on to others, but the movie does not do freethinkers and atheist proud."
2,Buy For the Extras,"This film is not a Bowling For Columbine. It's embarassing how bad the film actually is, despite some of the great things that it teaches. The creator of the film comes across as very angry, perhaps whiney. He wants to get even, so he made a film. The interview at the end of the film, where his subject walks off, is painful to watch. I highly recommend it for the extras which contain more thorough interviews with Richard Carrier, the creators of snopes, and other scholarly sorts, but there doesn't seem to be an atheist documentary that really lays everything out in cogent way."
3,Pausable but bitter.,"When I started to watch this vidio I really could relate to what was being said. I had my doubts too. But, when we got to the part where the author/producer/narator was at his old school, I kind of got the feeling that he was bitter and angry, which for me made everything that came before seemed more slanted then I had thought throughout the begining of the show. The begining of the show seems more factual until the end then it seemed emotional, like the christian community."
2,Atheist viewer greatly disappointed by lack of content,"I am an atheist of the non-evangelical sort; a libertarian rather than Communist or left-liberal. I bear no malice against those with religious faith, although I do find it irrational and even harmful. With that out of the way, I must say I was very disappointed in THE GOD WHO WASN'T THERE. The content was just woefully lacking. More than an examination of the ""Jesus Myth Hypothesis,"" which I find very interesting, it is a simple critique on the practice of Christian religion, and a fairly unimaginative one at that. I was hoping for an entire movie dedicated to the astrological interpretation of the ""Jesus Myth"" explored in ZEITGEIST PART I, with some more evidence linking Jesus to other ""Sun Gods"" -- but there is none here. ZEITGEIST provided much more information and, sadly, is more professional, too. I watched this movie one time and then sold it. I had no desire to ever watch it again or share it with friends."
3,atheism for dummies,"I liked the movie, but like others here commented it was too short for a documentary. Also I agree with the comments that the director had a vendeta, specially with the poor guy who's the principal at his former Christian school. The information he intorduces is very basic and does not elaborate on it much. We know the Jesus Story and he spends too much time on that part! And the pagan gods segment, which might be new info to viewers, is very brief. I think it was just OK. I made me feel that this person has anger and felt duped by Christianity and that is not everyone's experice. Just as there is eveidence against a historicla JC there is al evidence for him, so this is a very subjective point of view.The tenents and beliefs of the Christian faith stand strongly, beyond the mythos of the virgin birth and resurection claims. And believe me, I'm far from fundamentalist. Sometimes anger and bitternes will blind us to the greater spiritual truth. But overall good effort."
1,"Superficial, smug, and unsatisfying","Simply not a very good movie. A hacked out superficial piece of junk with useless interviews, horrible music, and ridiculously bad editing. This whole thing watches like a high school documentary project. There's a smug ""look how dumb these people are"" attitude through this that uses immature tactics like making fun of the kids who burned to death in Waco as ""crispy"". The narration audio has to fight against a horrible mix of techno/new age music that makes it difficult to concentrate.There's some good historical info here, but only about 20% of this movie is truly good. Bringing up fanatic people he seemingly stopped on the street at random to show how stupid Christianity is, simply doesn't build a good case. ""Ha ha...this dude in a parking lot doesn't even know who Osiris is!""I'm behind the message underneath this, and am not hating for any moral reason. I simply know a crappy documentary when I see one."
3,Was Jesus the only Savior?,"This documentary was a bit disappointing in parts, though it did raise a couple of salient points to anyone seeking to look into the historical Jesus debate. It presents some startling facts about how the gospel accounts of Jesus may have been borrowed from other cultures and religion's ""savior"" type figures. Many of these similarities between Jesus and other figures such as Krisha or Mithras, for example, are unfortunately uncanny. Worth looking at, but could have been better done."
1,"Important subject, badly made","Brian Flemming falls into the same trap as many unexperienced documentary makers do: He tries to ridicule those he is supposed to convince believe in the wrong things, and spreads bad music fairly evenly all over. A similar approach as Ben Stein had in his ridiculous ""documentary"" on evolution called ""Expelled"". The Germans have a saying for this: ""Man merkt die Absicht und wird verstimmt"". The interviews are good because the participants are trained in this, but nothing new in them. Flemmings personal part just ends in being able to have a his interview object braking the conversation and him saying ""I don't beleive in the Holy Ghost"", which is hardly a very provocative or enlightening statement. The subject of disproving the existence of Jesus gets lost in bad editing and bad visual material. So if this is the best American Documentarists can produce on such an important question, i'd rather watch ""Life of Bryan"" again"
4,Questioning whether Jesus really existed,"The first half of this movie focuses on the question of whether the historical Jesus really existed. I cannot pretend to know enough about the history to tell you whether the film's version of events is accurate, but it most certainly is interesting. The movie goes on to explore the existance of god and religion in general.This is a fairly low-budget, documentary style movie. You will not mistake it for a Hollywood blockbuster. Still, it is reasonably professionally done and you won't mistake it for someone's home movie, either.This movie features an on-camera interview with Sam Harris, author of End of Faith and Letter to a Christian Nation. The extras include an audio interview with Richard Dawkins, author of The God Delusion, The Selfish Gene and The Blind Watchmaker. I recommend all five of those books highly. For a view from the religious side of the aisle, read Karen Armstrong, e.g., History of God."
2,God no,"A very patchy [and short] rant against Christianity, which loses its effect by its style. I much prefer other efforts."
1,Boring,"This was a waste of time to watch, I fell asleep and ended up eventually fast forwarding it. What was in this documentary that we didn't already know? I don't know why I was suckered into watching this, I guess because my cousin wants me to become a skin head and start rallying against those religious people. I do not care, I have said this time and time again, these people that make these movies, books, what not are doing it for MONEY. They all want this war to continue because if we all would agree to disagree how fun would that be? Put your money to better use and donate to something that is actually a worthy cause, like science research. not this lame he said she said bull."
1,The Argument that Wasn't There ...,"Lame-oh....(Are negative stars possible?)The director of this pedantic and heavy handed film over-reaches in his title, which purports to be a defense of atheism. Instead, he limits his salvo to a broadside on Christianity and the historicity of Christ. He seems to argue that Jesus was not a real figure, for example, just a folklore character. This ignores the fact that some contemporaneous historians - Josephus and Pliny both make specific reference to Jesus. It is hard to follow the thread of the argument.The movie seems to have an axe to grind, winding up at the private Christian academy he attended as a child, grilling the headmaster. This is painful to watch. The debate between ""science"" and faith may never be resolved, but it seems arrogant to presume that science is by definition superior to faith. The dude is a Michael Moore-wannabe. If he felt this was debunking God or Christianity, then he needs his head examined."
2,so what?..................,"regardless of your religion, or even your lack of religion.......there are so many blessings, and so many curses.......why?.....we do not know....ultimately it seems like the creator made both....., why?..........the searching for why, is the basis of our religions.....they help us to feel comfortable in a world with the blessings, and help us to manage with the curses.....why?.....maybe we could use god talking to 'job,'.....'that's just the way it is'........"
1,Not worth your time,"Don't bother paying even $2 for this film.... it's not worth your time. You want to watch a quality film about Jesus, then watch the Passion produced by Mel Gibson."
2,More Rehashed Arguments,"I'm sorry for all of you unbelievers, but it seems Brian Flemming went to his local Barnes and Noble to get some ""arguments"" against Christianity and came out with a home video edited on his Mac. Are you all giving this much credit to a ""film maker"" with arguments that are used by the average Joe? So he doesn't think Jesus is real and he found liberal theologians to back up what he thinks.Where were the conservative theologians? Where was Ravi Zachrias and Albert Mohler? Be your own academic. If Jesus didn't exist, I guess we're all off the hook and no one is accountable for anything. If he did exist (and his claims are real) well, that's something you'll have to live with forever."
2,"Preachy, Bad","The best part about this DVD is the features, particularly the interviews with Dawkins and Doherty. The director otherwise comes off as a preachy, smug arsehole, who gets a kick out of making fun of fundamentalist Christians, which is like shooting dead fish in a barrel. the film itself is awful, mostly bad graphics, worse soundtrack and awful clips from old 50s Christ dramas. Awful stuff. The big finale occurs when the director gets into an argument with a Christian school superintendent. Superintendent: It's a matter of faith. Director: But where's the evidence? Superintendent: We're teaching faith and love. Director: You're teaching lies!!! The superintendent, discovers that the director had misrepresented himself and the purpose of the interview and walks off in a huff. Apparently that proves Christ is a myth. Obviously the director had no idea how to transfer the concept of the mythical Christ to film. Read Challenging the Verdict instead."
1,Polemical Mush,"Brian Flemming is the kid who finds out that Santa Claus isn't real and petulantly goes around trying to spoil it for everyone else. The greatest sin the film commits is that it is extremely boring. The film is disorganized, grossly uniformed, polemical, taking quotes out of context and propagandizing in exactly the same manner that it accuses Christianity of. It is simply fundamentalism of a different stripe."
1,Garbage,"I watched about the first 1/2 hour of this movie. It was so full of inaccuracies and flawed logic, I couldn't stand it anymore. I really did want to watch it, and was hoping it would be somewhat scholarly or intelligent. It was just a jumbled mess of sloppy thought and accusations. Don't waste your time. If you want to know the truth about Christianity, do your own research."
5,Great,"This documenatry was great! It told it like it is, and showed that the Bible/Christianity is basically nonsense and nothing new. Quite entertaining, too!"
2,Arrogant and One Sided,"I was a little disappointed by the overall quality of the documentary. Although I'm intellectually aligned with the director and narrator, I felt the entire documentary was poorly done. The tone of his narration was arrogant and annoying throughout the entire film, which I found distracting.It also wasn't very scholarly and balanced. Sure, he had scholars who were aligned with his views, but he relied on everyday clueless Christians off the street to represent the other side.The music and animation throughout the movie was pleasant and interesting, but again, distracting. Overall, it was really lacking meat. I got way more substance from reading the God Delusion by Richard Dawkins and Misquoting Jesus by Bart D. Ehrman.Overall, I really don't recommend wasting your time and money on this DVD, unless you're really interested in simply watching a multi-media, one-sided approach to one person's personal reconciliation with growing up as a Christian and then dissing it."
5,some suggestions...,"If you are really serious about the evidence of the historical jesus, you have to do buisness with marcus borg (oxford educated), dominic crossan (jesus historian, not a christian) and n.t. wright (oxford educated). If you want to understand the original christian movement in the 1st century context apart from strict 21st century literal-fundamentalism or current mainline christianity, (what the documentary targets) read their books, you'll be surprised."
3,Too much attitude; not enough substance,"I was hoping that this would be a more informative DVD than it was. Too much time is spent on interviews (for such a short DVD) and not enough time is spent presenting ideas about the pagan antecedents of Christianity. I'm sure that most people who have never heard of Dionysus, etc., were wondering what sort of arguments the makers of this DVD were trying to make. For a very thorough discussion of the possible ""pagan"" connections to Christianity, I suggest reading ""Suns of God"", by Acharya S (Yes, that's the full name of the author!). Although some of the references in that book might be questionable, there are PLENTY of books and authors quoted that can lead one to more solid ground. I think that the makers of this DVD were too bitter in their approach to the subject matter, which overshadowed their arguments and evidence."
3,Good Info but not what I expected,"The movie has good information and is pretty well done, but it's obvious that the person who is narrating is a little bit bitter (aren't all of us who have been burned by xianity?). I think the arguments he makes and the questions he asks would be more credible if his anger and bitterness weren't so obvious. I was showing the dvd to my husband who is still a believer and his first reaction was ""That's just some guy who is pissed at the church!"" - In a way he was right and it was hard for me to use the movie at that point to further my cause."
1,Terrible,"This was a real let down. There is very little content, the pacing is slow, and it is very over-dramatized. Watching Religulous will cover all of the same factual information with a vastly superior presentation.Truly, this was a waste of money."
2,Sophomoric at best,"This DVD contains nothing new, and does contain way too many views that are expressed in a sophomoric, disrespectful manor. If you are looking for a good debate about God, with fair respectful views from both sides, watch the God Delusion Debate."
3,The Jesus Question,"While the movie has some interesting and new information, I was quite disappointed to see that it is presented only from an atheist point of view. This of course means that there is little objectivity. The same would be true, of course, if it had been produced by conservative christians. I expected a more scholarly work. Next time I will read the reviews more carefully."
2,Appears to misquote the Bible...,"I am an atheist. I was watching this movie and was about to send a Bible verse the movie quotes to my brother (who is a gay-friendly Christian). Luckily, I checked my Bible and several other versions of the Bible only to find that this film appears to misquote the Bible.The film quotes Leviticus 18:22, ""If a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them have committed a detestable act. They must be put to death.""The King James Version of the Bible (usually the harshest) reads, ""Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination.""Atheists have all the facts on our side. There is no reason to make things up, Mr. Flemming. It could be that I just have not found a of the Bible where this quote lays, in which case, sorry about the 2 stars."
3,Entertaining for atheists... but,"This film was entertaining in it's irreverence if not completely groundbreaking. The problem is, if this film was meant to provoke thought amongst Christians, it will fail abjectly, mainly because of the irreverence. If we are to change minds and enlighten people, one does not do it through mocking tones. Present facts (there are a preponderance of them), support those facts (easy to do when the evidence is large in scope), and let them stand on their own. Testimonials only work when someone is on the fence and leaning your way."
3,Good for those who are contemplating a Supernatural God,"The interviews and sources are highly reputable and entertaining. This movie would be good for those who are questioning religion in regards to Jesus Christ and a Supernatural God. However, for those who have researched the myth of Jesus Christ, the movie may just reiterate what you may already know. I believe the best part of the movie is the lack of knowledge Christians have about the history of Christianity. Overall, the movie keeps your attention, gets to the point, and will entertain you."
4,hope for critical thinking,"Although this film is short, it gives a good insight in the characteristics of religion. An unmasking and demystifiing personal story."
2,Save your money...,Save your money and watch for free the same material but in much greater detail on the Internet by doing a search for the movie Zeitgeist. (It was on YouTube last time I looked) (Slight warning though - only the 1st Chapter deals with religion...the rest discusses 911 so at least watch it for the 1st Chapter)I was disapointed in spending the amount of money for something that was done for free and better quality. I am at least grateful to Amazon because they had it for alot less than the films website did.I am mainly posting this review with a nod to another movie because I think this topic is important to discuss and Zeitgeist does a better and more detailed job.FYI - My account is my real name and does not infer anything
1,MISSED OPPORTUNITY,"The significant issues to which this DVD refers essentially deserve more scrutiny than this blatant example of over-simplification provides.The too few references mentioned during the DVD have more value than this very, low budget DVD has to offer.A disappointment which did not match the hype!"
1,Lost in the inner space.,"The idea of this film is good and actual. Its really translates the inner feeling that partain people from 21 centure. This film is a personal revanche as "" The third Jihad, Religulous and othres."
3,THE GOD WHO WASN'T THERE,"I agree with those who say the interview with Dr. Sipis was a cheap shot. The interviews with Richard Carrier, Sam Harris , Robert M. Price, and Alan Dundes were very interesting.To the Christians who wrote reviews who state that even atheists agree that there was absolutely a Jesus shouldn't put words in other peoples mouths. There really isn't any proof (maybe there was, maybe there wasn't) and as pointed out in the video there were at least a half dozen previous individuals or myths that did every thing that Jesus supposedly did.The video would have been better if there was more Richard Carrier and Sam Harris. The Earl Doherty commentary was worth listening to. More facts more charts and maybe it would convince more people to evaluate the dangers of religion.Scott Butcher scared me."
3,"OK, but not much new!",This dvd was alright though there wasn't much new in content. I would have liked to have seen longer interviews with such people as Sam Harris. The content was very good--just not enough of it in my opinion. Still it was worth the watch!
4,The God Who wasn't There,This is an interesting movie with pertinent information. It was shorter than I expected but the interviews afterwards make up for the short video.
4,The God Who Wasn't There,"Good ideas, good research. I agree with his concept.But this movie seems like some kind of a home movie. Amateurish as hell."
5,Very entertaining and informative!,"When you can take such a serious subject, and challenge it, and yet do it in a tastfull and humorous way, you've made a great documentary. All of the information in this video is not new material, but it is new to anyone who has never heard it (or wanted to hear it), or read or studied history of ancient religions. I have shared this video with a number of friends and they all come back flabergasted (in a good way)!Lots of great extra material and interviews, good special effects, and good sound track to top it all off."
3,The God Who Wasn't There,"I was expecting more from this documentary, but there were definitely some gold nuggets in it. Production value isn't great, but the idea and most of the content is right on target."
1,Is this serious,Looking for something to see that will show that there is no evidence of God well ahhh do not look here. I now beleave in God more then anything else the evidence of this movie makes me beleave this is actually a pro christian movie after all.
1,Read all of the ONE STAR reviews,"I consider myself to be fairly well versed in history and theology. I also consider myself to be very open minded when it comes to Christian history and interpretation. I am the complete opposite of a Christian fundamentalist. With that being said, I have no agenda and take no personal offense by the horrible quality of this film.I have nothing new or unique to say in my criticism of this film because it has all been said several times by those giving 1 STAR. Their arguments are my arguments.My only purpose is to add a voice of support to their accurate commentary and to give this awful film another low rating.As has been mentioned in other posts, if you are interested in critical study of Christianity, there are several other authors (John Shelby Spong, Bart Ehrman, Marcus Borg, etc.) that are far more qualified to make historical and theological arguments. You'd be wise to not buy/rent this movie and look for these other authors."
1,one of the bigger deceptions in the anti-christian world,"Yeah, some people feel like they have to attack Christianity for a variety of reasons. This guy got kicked out of a christian school and now he hates God, and lies in order to make a movie about it. I checked out about half of his ""facts"" and quotations -- they're false. The other half I couldn't find anywhere, and I am damn good at researching stuff. So, he is a liar simply trying to give God a black eye. The funny part is, he tries to be sophisticated about his argument, but he ends up looking like a fool before the end of the movie. Ironically, the only ones who don't look like they've got a chip on their shoulder (and half a brain) are the only christians (two of them) he intereviews. PLEASE -- DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. If you really want to get rid of 25 bucks, give it to a charity -- don't give it to him or his producers."
2,The God Who Wasn't There,"Don't waste your money! This is a film by a disgrutled Christian Fundamentalist. He's gone from one fringe group to another. He didn't have one theologian in his group of ""experts"" and I use that term loosely. The biblical quotes cited in the movie were completely out of context. Example: a quote from a parable Jesus taught, was used as his own words. It actually came from an old story that was told before Jesus' time. Also, the premise that Jesus is God is only held by catholics and fundamentalist Christians. Jesus never proclaimed to be God. This video has been sucessfully hyped and promoted but does not live up to any of it. I paid the price because I thought I would learn something - I was wrong."
3,"Some good things here, but...","As an agnostic, I have spent a great deal of my life trying to understand people of faith. This movie does try to shed some light on the evangelical folks, but I wanted more depth and less camp at times. There are some very great parts to this film, but it felt like a first effort, or rough draft. It seemed like the director had an axe to grind. If the filmmaker could focus more on the actual words and beliefs of these people (which I think are extremely telling and scary) and less on trying to convince the audience in his own words that Christianity has serious flaws, I think the film could be brilliant. I'm glad I bought it, and I await the expanded version, should one be in the works."
5,A Release fFrom Bondage,"After having been exposed for a lifetime, and virtually from birth,to a barrage of religious rhetoric such as ""Savior, Prince of Peace, God's only begotten Son"" etc., this film is like a breath of fresh air. My intellect and capacity to REASON are given a degree of pure freedom which I will relish forever. Nature's gift of LOGIC will reign supreme and my subjugation to the supernatural, ancient superstitions and mythology will no longer torture the essence of my existence."
4,Two major issues in film - perhaps too much for one film,"Making the case that St Paul neither met Jesus nor wrote ""anything at all"" about a human saviour (as opposed to a pre-existing saviour god) requires more documentation than the film provides. It is an excellent subject, of course.The other subject in the film is the proposition that since (as ""proven"" or probably) Jesus never existed, therefore Christianity is false. Accepting the fact that we know nothing about Jesus' existence as a man is different from rejecting Christianity. That only makes sense to literalist American fundamentalist ""Christians"" who know nothing about the history of Christianity and the various interpretations of Christianity. As the theologian Paul Tillich implied, the real test of a Christian is to believe the Evangels (or ""good news,"" literally) even if perfect proof were provided that Jesus never existed!"
1,It's interesting how...,"It's interesting how this guy took the most EXTREME, bordering-on-hate-group ""Christians"" and put them down, saying ALL Christians are like that. And then made a point to say they know nothing about his life, and how the gospel was spread after Christ ascended back into heaven.It's also interesting that when one of this guy's professor buddies was reading off similarities between different folklore, (saying Christianity wasn't anything more than that) the professor couldn't give an exact estimation of similarities Christianity had to the other allegorical stories told through time.""Why can't I be this happy?"" Was his question. Well... You can't be happy because of something going on within your heart, sir. That is the only way God can change you. I pray for you, and I hope that one day God is revealed to you in a right and just way, for his glory."
3,Could of been done better,"I'm not a christian, this had poor lighting, so - so interviews, I wished it had more facts than options, There is plenty out there. The Movie Zietgiest had a better opening to where the myth came from. There are number of forgeries in scripture, and a lot of facts not here. Save your money, sit around table with friends and get more out of it."
2,The smugness wears on you,"I was looking for an objective, even keel approach to this topic. Although the DVD has some very interesting discussion points, Brian Flemming a former evangelist, delivers his interviews and talk overs in a smug, condescending way which takes away from the message. Many times he comes across as a Christian bashing / mocking jerk instead of just presenting the facts and letting the viewer decide and ponder. Too bad because the topics are very thought provoking. BnB Beatles Depot"
2,Polemic waste of time,"There are several people who have done a good job of critiquing Christianity. This guy, Brian Fleming, is not one of them. He's so polemic, one-sided, and childish.The part where he was in the chapel and he said ""I blaspheme the Holy Spirit"", that was the dumbest part of the movie.The one bright spot was when he showed footage with Alan Dundes, the author ofHoly Writ as Oral Lit: The Bible as Folklore.Professor Dundes did a much better job of critiquing Christianity than Brian Fleming. I recommend his book, as well asDeconstructing Jesusby Robert M. Price, andMisquoting Jesus: The Story Behind Who Changed the Bible and Why (Plus)by Bart Ehrman. Professor Ehrman has done several outstanding audio programs for The Teaching Company."
2,Shallow and trite,"Not the film I expected- poorly written, without fresh perspective or new ideas, just shrill and dull. Even poorly filmed. Too bad."
2,not worth the money,"while it was somewhat interesting..as an atheist, i thought it was just making fun of religion. i agree with some of it but it was not anything knew or that i hadnt heard and def not worth more than $5. sad i wasted my money."
5,I Saw My Husband & I (& Children) In Each Page!,"I related to this book so much that I couldn't put it down. I am a non-ADD spouse to an ADD husband and have 2 ADD children. I was looking for hope & pointers on understanding my ADD family members' view of life and how I could help strengthen our family ties. This book helped me not only understand their strengths and weakenesses, it helped me see the importance I had in their lives. I felt more empowered with each page. It helps me daily as I encounter each new situation. My husband & I were both happy to start applying the suggestions the book gave on making our lives together more fulfilling."
4,A Great Help!,"In my marriage I am the spouse with ADHD. In contrast to the previous reviewer my wife and I found this book to be a great help. It helped both of us to understand my condition and according to my wife it helped her understand that I wasn't against her. In describing ADHD behavior rather than excusing it, I felt that the book gave some useful tools for change. Of course if the ADHD spouse is a jerk and unwilling to change, then that's a different story. The book is written from a Christian perspective so it was also helpful to find a Christian resource that said something more than the usual cliche's like, ""just try harder""...""you should just forgive him, etc."" I would recommend this book if you believe that ADD/ADHD might be affecting your marriage and you're looking for help"
2,Not what I thought it would be.,"I bought this book thinking it would be geared more for the spouse of an ADD person. But this book was actually more of an advice book FOR the ADD person themselves. There was a large emphasis on education; encouragment and tips to help the ADD person in continuing their education. Again, geared towards the ADD person and not the significant other/spouse on how to deal with it all."
2,Not the best Scherchen,"I've had this one since 1957 when it came out on LP. Scherchen's 1954 mono recording was revolutionary in that it used Handel's original orchestration (fortunately with modern instruments) and had a true baroque conception as opposed to the pseudo-Romantic approach everyone else was using. Tenor William Herbert and trumpeter George Eskdale were outstanding; baritone Richard Standen and alto Constance Shacklock also had a lot of good moments.This 1957 recording was apparently motivated by the need to ""do it in stereo."" But it's not as good as the original. The Viennese chorus does not sing English as it should be sung, and the soloists are undistiguished. Standen, who sings on both, is better in the earlier recording. The only really fine part of this recording is the opening of the Amen chorus.So I hope there will soon be a re-issue of the better 1954."
4,"A Superior ""Messiah""","This is a fine performance that is well worth having; Scherchen was a very interesting conductor. However, I agree with Mr. Sherman that it is not as good as the original 1954 mono recording of the ""Dublin"" version. I bought both the '54 and '57 recordings when they came out, and have other recordings of ""Messiah"". The 1954 Scherchen recording is the one I go back to. The sound quality is still wonderful. With mono like that I don't need stereo, just as with the early '50s Mercury Olympian Series recordings. Someone should certainly reissue it. It has historic as well as artistic value."
3,"It's not bad, just different....","I was raised on Messiah, but I've had to understand that not every interpretation is MY interpretation. I was rather jarred by Simoneau, but I grew used to it. The soprano, Alarie, was too fairy-piper for me. Nonetheless, I appreciate this recording. I bought it for Nan Merriman, although I'd forgotten about the fast vibratto, which I personally don't like; but she does a bang-up job of it, vibrato and all.I have a number of Messiahs, Hickox (for the soloists), Gardiner (for the choir), Pinnock, for the chilly. I've just bought Beecham, for the, okay, amazed. I treasure every effort for Messiah, however I might like one over another. The way I see it, no one can have too many Messiahs.Having said all that, is there anyone who can locate for me a German Messiah? I temporarily found one reviewed in Opera News, went back and never found it. I'd appreciate it if someone reading this can direct me. I really want that German Messiah.Nancy Eckert"
3,"If I were to grade this book, it's a B-","I was thrilled to see this book at the store but it cost $25!! I'm glad that I was able to find an alternative by browsing amazon for $8 and my purchase arrived right on time!The contest of the book is very helpful, specially to a lot of new teachers. You can gather a lot of ideas from it. However, for seasoned teachers, there are a few that the book can offer but not much. The routines and idea of set up is great, however, most of the pictures featured very cluttered classrooms.The book does not offer a variety of classroom set ups either. It does not cater to bigger classrooms or classroom in challenging neighborhoods.As promising as this book can be, there is a lot of room for improvement."
3,Manual... Everyone needs a manual,"It's got all the stuff you need to repair, rev up & rejuvinate your old GS..."
5,Great DVD,Great DVD. Enjoyed by a WW2 primary flight instructor with thousands of hours in the Stearman.
2,Not unrated,"I thought I was going to get the unrated copy as the picture states. I did not, I got a blockbuster rental exclusive copy which is not unrated, as far as I can tell. It came in good time though, but I'd like my money back and to get an actual unrated copy."
3,"If you want a good laugh, watch this movie!","I was one of those who dodged movie theaters because my gut told me this movie wouldn't live up to any real expectations. Well I was half right, I truly enjoyed Megan Fox's and Amanda Sayfield's performances. I thought their chemistry and timing with a lot of the more funnier scenes was pretty good. Where it doesn't get the full 5 stars, I believe this movie was pitched (marketed) as a horror movie, and to me it was far from the truth. I would definitely watch this movie again when I need a good laugh for about an hour and half."
1,Horrible,"After seeing this movie on instant video, I am certainly glad I did not waste my money to see it at the theater."
5,Megan Fox Transformer: more than meets the eye,"Sexy Megan Fox stars in this movie!What else needs to be said?What more can you ask for? :-PMegan Fox plays a hot high school girl, Jennifer, who was wrongly killed in a dark ritual by a power-seeking boy band. The slipshod sacrifice was impure and Jennifer returns as a comical man-eating monster. Dark humor surrounds this movie, but who cares about the plot or anything else for that matter when Megan Fox plays a seductive transformer?"
3,Not very scary but decent,"Not quite the horrorfest I hoped for, but still bloody and gory with a touch of satanism. Fox's character is a typical pretty, popular mean girl, only in this case she's friends with a girl next door type. Then one night she is sacrificed and a demon enters her, making her even more evil with the need to feed. Her best friend is the only one in the know and no ones believes her, so it is up to her to stop Jennifer. The worst part is we know all along whats basically going to happen, since the movie opens with Seyfried's character in prison. I dislike when movies open with the ending as it ruins a lot of the suspense. But all in all, great acting on Seyfried's part and Fox worked her assets, but it could have been better."
1,Terrible,"I've been struggling for the past few hours, and so far I haven't though of a movie that was worse than this one. Do you remember that episode of family guy where peter makes his own movie called ""Steel vaginas"" and everyone is disappointed and leaves when it's over? I'd rather watch steel vaginas."
2,trash,"TRASH-----You know what all movies do when they are trash? they add ass!hey I can get a great skin flick if I need it! It seems that the writers of most new films have ran out of ideas?! or they just have no ideas? whatever the case-------please retire before it's to late!people really have these thoughts? If life is coming to an end? I can understand why it needs to.if you enjoyed movies like Idol hands? this may be the film for you?even Idol hands was better, and thats not saying much at all."
3,Average Story,"Overall, I enjoyed this movie. The story and cinema photography were good...but, the acting was a little weak. Looking back I should have rented it instead of purchasing it."
2,Campy? No...just awful!,"Everyone knows why they went to see this movie....I don't even have to say it, but being female I was trying to be a little more invested in the plot...if there was one. When watching this it almost reminded me of 'The Faculty' with Clea Duvall, Josh Hartnett, etc., but this film was complete dreck!The dialogue, while fun and 'tweenish', made no sense or complimented the plot whatsoever. It just seemed like the director was only thinking about, 'Which camera angles makes Megan look hot'. (Yes, I know the director's female).This movie would have been much better if you actually found out, hmmm I dunno what actually happened to Jennifer's body. They never shine light on that and it left a huge damaging plothole in the movie...and that was unforgivable!"
1,No thanks.,Anything made by the pathetic Diablo Cody (juno) needs to be in hell itself with hime and every copy of Juno. As for this film it's nothing special and every prediction you have when seeing the cover is obvious and correct.
4,Pretty Good Movie with a sense of humor,"Not great but a nice little movie with an interesting story line. Great scenery ala Megan Fox and I really like Amanda too. Pretty nice special effects too. Not a classic but you will have a good time. OK, guys might have a better time but it is worthy of putting on the popcorn and have some fun."
3,"The good, the bad and the bitchy.","I went into this movie expecting a lot and when it started out I thought I was getting it. As the movie progressed though, I realized it wasn't much more of a movie then Idle Hands (admittedly a decent movie, but doesn't hold up over time). This was the case in this movie. Unlike that film though, which seemed to go overboard, I felt this movie didn't do quite enough. Overall a good horror/comedy movie, more of a rental then a buy though."
3,Jennifer can bite me anytime,"Jennifer (Megan Fox) and Needy (Amanda Seyfried) grew up together but one day after a tragic party Jennifer changes her snacking habits. The male population of the local high school seems to be consumed by the change. Can Needy help Jennifer get over her untidy habit?This was not quite, what I expected. I counted on a rather lame zombie movie where she is too slow to eat only the slow movers. What I got a story more of in line with the ""Ginger Snaps"" series. It had more to do with sisterly love and a dash of blood. The film was cute but not memorable. Mayan's tossed virgins in the senote all the time. So why not Jennifer?I only saw the Blu-ray so I cannot compare the versions. However, do not overlook the Blu-ray extras.Ginger Snaps - The Trilogy (special Collector's Edition)(Boxset)A little more esoteric.Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death"
1,I think it sucked,"Just my opinion but I think it sucked. Whoever thinks Megan Fox is hot must have some pretty low standards. What a joke. I prefer blondes anyway. I thought the movie was a complete waste of my time and perhaps one of the stupidest movies I have ever seen, it's possible it might be more meaningful for high school kids I don't know. The other girl featured who was Jennifer's friend was butt ugly. Geez. No thanks. Another stupid movie written by a some foolish idiot I am sure. So many of the movies these days suck, and this is no exception. Take 'Dracula 2000' for example, that was much better. There are a lot of great movies out there but I don't believe this is one of them. But that's just my 28 year old perspective, perhaps others might like it I don't know."
1,Laughable?,"I saw this movie expecting that I might at least be entertained by bad acting and writing. I was actually OVERWHELMED by the appalling stench of this movie.The writing is littered with cliches, stupid lines, and awkward plot devices. The plot skips along carelessly while you're left wondering what the hell is happening and whether or not you should become invested in characters. The acting is lifeless, bland, and just plain bad. The effects are definitely not what I would call stimulating.To reiterate, I jumped into this movie expecting to at least be amused at it's awfulness but I found myself spending far too much time cringing at it and developing a disdain for its very existence.If you enjoy this movie, then I'm sorry. It's just stupid and a complete waste of time and money."
3,Jennifer's Body,A cheerleader with the perfect life becomes the girl from hell when she gets possessed and begins killing boys in a small town. This movie is not a horror or scary movie at all. This movie missed it's mark completely.
4,Jennifer,"For the most part, I thought this film was interesting. Megan Fox did a good job as a... demon or whatever she was. There are plenty of movies about chicks feeding off of guys, but it's always nice to see a new one. The movie was a dark terror comedy for teens so don't expcet that much from it."
3,On the fence,"I rented it from Comcast. I found it simultaneously interesting & a bit boring. I like the overall story & ending okay but even with finding Megan Fox really hot, it just didn't seem to hold my interest that much. I don't know if it was the pace of the movie or what, it just left me luke warm so to speak."
2,Horrible,"Horrible is what this movie is.I'm a huge fan of horror movies but they just don't make them like they used.Why add in that lesbian kissing scene?Not everyone that watches this movie are teenage boys wich it seems like that's who this movie was targeted for.This movie was just plain bad!I suggest you skip this one but if you must see it,I recommend you wait until it's on tv or check it out from the library."
2,Just a blah movie,"Horrible acting with an over played story line. Not really worth the money just cause megan fox is in it. This movie is about a school loser that is best friends with the schools vampire and doesnt even know it. Its not really an original story line, and the actors are just as bad. Buy something else instead."
1,Megan Fox is hot but Jennifer sucks badly,- The plot is nothing.- The special effect is like that of a TV show.- There's no suspense or horror.- The acting is below average.- I regret spending money to watch it at the theatre with a friend.
1,Too predictable...not my kind of movie,Watched it once then twice and wasn't sold. The movie was quite predictable in the beginning and as I continued to watch I already knew what would happen. Not my kind of horror movie and that's my honest opinion. Others may like it depending on what they're in to.
4,Creepy & Sexy!!!,"I thought this was a really good horror film with an awesome storyline. Needy Lesnicki and Jennifer Cheek have been friends ever since they were little girls, even though they don't have much in common. When they are at a bar with a band that somehow causes a fire, Needy and a few others escape, but Jennifer is kidnapped by the band for a Satanic sacrifice that goes wrong, because she is not a virgin. Jennifer is possessed by a demon and she is forced eat men in order to look young and beautiful. On the night of the dance, Needy must stop her 'friend' from killing anyone else. I highly recommend JENNIFER'S BODY!!!"
4,A fun dark comedy,"Ok, now I know this is not a comedy..... But the writers didn't take themselves too seriously, and pulled together a really interesting film. The premise is cool, the writing is good, the acting is good. It's got some spoof elements, but hidden within a good scary story. I enjoyed the dark, sarcastic elements of humor, and enjoyed this film overall even though it had a bit more blood and gore than I generally like. I did not expect to like this movie, but I really did !"
4,BFFs,"This movie came out at the same time with a graphic novel tie in. On the surface it's about a succubus type who feeds on high school boys to sustain herself. Expect lots of gore and inside jokes. Under the surface it takes a look at the power structure of female BFFs. Fox pretty much plays herself or how she thinks some people perceives her and she does a competent enough job. I find it peculiar that the Razzie Awards nominated her as worst actress but then I remembered that a lot of these nominations, like many things, just have to do with the fact that said people don't like Megan Fox because she's pretty and they're not. There's actually some amusing moments in here more related to American high school perceptions and beliefs. Horror is more campy and amusing than outright terrifying.HUMOR: B minus to B; STORY/PLOTTING: B minus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B minus to B; OVERALL GRADE: B minus to B; WHEN WATCHED: mid April 2011."
3,It is what it is,"With some of the zinging dialogue from Diablo Cody's script, there is no way on God's Little Green Earth that this is ""The Worst Movie of 2009"" and those who claim it is are either (a) Megan Fox haters or (b) the kind of people who do not go to the movies too often.That being said, this movie is what it is - namely an expoitation piece for Megan Fox with a pretty good script from one of Hollywood's hotest screenwriters, Diablo Cody.I liked it. I thought there could have been more out and out gore and temptation-ness from Ms Fox, but that's just a personal quibble.Megan Fox is seriously underrated by her detractors, who I think to a man, ( or is it woman? ), have only seen the Transformers movies. If you want to see her taking shots at her own image, rent ""How to Lose Friends and Alienate People"".And the worst movie of the year hands down is ""Transylmania""."
1,"Worse then I heard,",Unrated Version;Imagine someone made a decently filmed horror movie with a well known hottie as the main charactor... now imagine they showed it on Sunday morning in a very religious State that made them remove all the stuff you expected to see in an Unrated Version of a horror movie with a well known hottie... limited F/X and blood and even less skin.Of course it's another film with actors in their mid 20s playing high schoolers which doesn't help... unless the people in that town are as dumb as this flic.
2,"Good Idea, Bad Execution","The premise of this film pretty much sells itself: uber-hottie du jour Megan Fox plays a cheerleader possessed by a demon. But that's about it, at least for me; the story they tack on to it was rather weak. My main problem is that this film is told primarily in flashback, which pretty much dilutes any sort of tension. And then they didn't really take advantage of their selling point. This thing could've easily been ramped up into high camp, much likeGrindhouse Presents, Planet Terror - Extended and Unrated (Two-Disc Special Edition), but it fell far short of that. Oh well..."
2,Total thievery,"What could have been a great horror movie was instead brought low by mediocre acting and a plot completly stolen from another horror movie that did it so much better: Ginger Snaps. If you look, each film has 2 main female stars who are inseperable, then one is possessed by an evil force (demonic for JB, werewolf for GS) while the other is trying to figure out how to help them, and in the end the good one is infected as well. While Megan Fox is hot, there is nothing in this film really worth the time spent ogling her. Pass it up for Ginger Snaps instead, same plot, better execution."
2,MISLEADING TITLE,Having read the synopsis and previous reviews I had expected to open up a book on controlling tactics used by law enforcement professionals based on aikido techniques. How wrong can you be.The first 67 pages are what you expect in a general book on the subject of aikido. The 21 Tactics shown left me stunned.No17 sums it up. You cannot use this defence where an attacker bearhugs from behind around your elbows.We teach self defence and practice these types of attacks on both males & females. The suggested raising of the arms to break the grip as you step back is a joke. The attacker is usually right agianst your body and you cannot step back or raise your arms.There are numerous successful ways of defending agianst this type of attack but this is not one to be recommended.Overall I was disappointed with the content and feel I waisted my money.
1,Don't waste your time reading this.,"The First half of the book is the same as hundreds of other aikido books, about the second half: the techniques are badly explained, and the pictures are not any help."
2,Misleading title & waste of time,"I've read this book in few hours. As aikido apprentice (1st kyu) I jumped over the philosophical bla-bla to view those amazing techniques: the rear techniques are simple every-day's practice ""ushiro-waza"" with a gun in one hand. What if somebody stands in front of you pointing a gun in your mouth? And the knife techniques? People have to know that they have to train hard for several years before they can achieve the results shown in this book. Too many books about Aikido, anyway."
4,Seems as good as the original,"The only reason, I'm not giving this 5 stars is because the original rear cup holder was not very well designed, but this new one definitely measures up to the original."
3,"Pretty, but NOT EDIBLE???","I am new to the cake decorating business. I did a search for ""edible cake decor"". These popped up all over the place. When I received them, I saw bod print on the label saying ""NOT FOR CONSUMPTION"" & ""DO NOT EAT"". Now, I had to spend more money on 5 lbs of fondant, cake rounds & parchment paper so I could make a removable fondant top for the cakes to decorate."
5,Raquel's Review,"I got this doll seat for christmas and love it. The american girl today dolls fit great. Why I gave it only 4 stars in the educational value is because it comes with a doll that looks like a infant,but you can pretend it is a toddler boy. I would buy this toy agian."
5,NOT THAT BIG OF A DEAL!!(GREAT IDEA FOR A TOY),"I THINK ALL THESE PARENTS WITH CONCERNS ABOUT THE COLOR OF THE DOLL SHOULD TAKE THAT UP WITH THE COMPANY THAT MAKES THE TOY AND NOT WRITE ABOUT IT IN A REVIEW FOR THIS TOY. THAY ARE MAKING A BIG DEAL OUT OF SOMETHING THAT SHOULDNT BE! I HAVE SEEN DOLLS THAT ARE ONLY AFRICAN AMERICAN AND THEY DONT MAKE WHITE DOLLS, AND, ACTUALLY MY DAUGTER HAS A FEW! YOU NEED TO TEACH YOUR CHILDREN TO PLAY WITH DOLLS THAT ARE ALSO OUT OF THEIR RACE IN ORDER TO TEACH THEM THAT EVERYONE IS THE SAME!!"
1,All Babies are not the same.,"My daughter has alot of the Graco Items. She has the Travel System Stroller and Car Seat, 3 Way Pack N Play, High Chair, and Electronic Swing. I went to Toys R Us and notice that the now have a Graco 16"" or 18"" Doll. The Store did not have Ethnic dolls,(this is very command in Nebraska). I decided to go on line and there were no ethnic dolls there either. I am very disappointed that a company this large would not make sure that all dolls that are sold in there stores have more than just white dolls. I'm sure this is a problem that needs to be taken up with Tolly Tots. This product deserves no stars."
2,Disappointed in Graco,"I find it offensive that Graco did not choose to also make an ethnic doll for people with more pigment. As much money as I have spent over the years on Graco products and would have continued spending, I think they need to be a little more aware of their broad purchasing groups. I think that it is ridiculous that I had to buy the doll just so my daughter could get the car seat she wanted. Hopefully some less fortunate child at the womens shelter is enjoying the doll this very moment."
1,poor boxset and no 3d for part three either,"Don't get this boxset. You'd be better off getting the newer 2009 releases of these seperately in the deluxe edition. You'll pay more, but it won't be terribly expensive. I had this set and sold it in 2009 and purchased part 1-8 in deluxe editions. The boxset has terrible picture on some, I think part 4 mainly tho. The sound is terrible on all of these. This was a really quick sloppy put together job to make a quick buck. This set in my opinion is only worth $14.99 new. The newer releases have tons of extras, fantastic pictures, and awesome sound. Get those instead. You'll regret this boxset if you purchase it. It is that bad."
4,The series gets what it deserves,"Basically, if you're a fan of the series, get it...4 discs contain the 8 movies, plus a disc of bonus features. If you're into Friday the 13th, you've most likely seen the movies already, so I won't go into it now. A few of the movies feature audio commentary from the directors and actors. The bonus disc is lengthy, with many featurettes. However, almost all of the featurettes stem from the same set of interviews (with only a handful of cast members). As a fan, you've got to appreciate the bonus material - but it could have been done much better, but then again, so could have all of the movies themselves."
4,"Not Exactly the ""Ultimate Collection""","When Paramount pictures, first announced that they had a ""Friday the 13th"" film's box-set in the works, they said that they would release the films uncut. But over the past few months they have announced that they could not find the uncut footage. So what fans are left with are all of 8 first films with their original edits in widescreen on 4 discs (2 movies per disc), with an extra disc of special features. Special FEatures expected on the set include 4 Commentaries, 3 Featurettes (about 15 minutes each), a feature length documentary, are all 8 original trailers. Althought its not quite the ""Alien Quadrilogy"" that paramount promised, it is still the cheapest and easiest way to buy all of the first 8 friday films."
4,From Crystal Lake to Manhattan,"This was a really crappy box set. All movies and a lackluster bonus dvd is all we get. I do like the slim cases and putting two movies onto one disc, but I would've liked the see unrated versions of the films-if they even exist. The one worth while feature is the deleted scenes from Friday the 13th VII-The New Blood. Alot of fans want the uncut version of the film and this is probably as far as we'll ever see is the deleted scenes from that movie. It has Jason's best kills and are the best thing about the set that makes it worth owning. Overall, its a good set with the bonus disc of deleted kills from Part 7 making it a keeper."
3,Paramount Shafts Us On All Eight,"I love all of these movies(as cheesey as they are), but I don't understand why they haven't released the unedited versions . They should have released them simultaneously with the edited versions. But now they will never release them. 1)They've saturated the initial buyer market with crappy edited versions. 2)The geeks who would buy the unedited version even though they've already bought the edited version are few and far between. Weep now my friends, for you know I am right.(I have a degree in Business... but I have no job... So take it with a grain a salt)"
1,AWFUL,"F*ck Paramount!!! putting out the EDITED versions on a freakin' DVD set, hardly any extras and they cut down on the gore. How the hell are you going to put out a definitive boxset and f*ck with the original movies?!?! They really screwed up, and I hope all REAL Friday The 13th fans will boycott this atrocity of a boxset until they decide to do right. If your not going to put it out properly why do it at all?!"
1,A complete waste of film and my time.,"Simply put, these movies are not scary, nor are they entertaining in any concievable way. Stop and think people, this is junk, watch something better!"
3,Good but not perfect,"I bought this boxed set , it contains all the classic eight movies of this sequalbut it doesn't contains the DVD features such as , Behind the scenes , Trailers... etcso if you want to see all 8 movies of friday 13th buy this one OR wait the studio producethe completed version ."
5,Friday the 13th Set,This is a great deal!!! What i like most is that all 8 movies come on 5 discs. I think that is a cool idea. I wish more companies would do the same.
5,Friday the 13th - From Crystal Lake to Manhattan (8 Movies),This item I purchased for my other son. He likes this type of movie and was interested in getting all the movies that were included in this complete set. I found it was a better bargarin to get the complete set rather than the individual DVD's. This item should probably only be for the strong stomach folks. The cost for the complete set was also a really great price.
1,terrible,"i have enjoyed the first friday the 13th since i was very young. no clue why i haven't gotten around to the other 9 and i finally did with this box set and separate purchase of 9 and 10 and now i completely regret it ! my girlfriend and i wanted to have a friday the 13th marathon and we got through 4 before we turned it off. it got boring, the kills were not invented what so ever, the characters were stupid (but that was the point), the plot became stale and who the hell can not out run jason ?!?!? got a big ass dude with a big ass knife chasing you and you can't run like the wind or even properly kill him when you have the chance (CUT HIS HEAD OFF !) ? basically all 10 movies with the exception of the first are the same. only thing different is the cast, location and stupidityim sticking with nightmare on elm street as the best horror series !"
5,Jason is God!,"I just got the box set for Christmas and I've been drooling ever since. I had been waiting a very long time for this to come out. I was only 8 when the first Friday the 13th came out, but my oldest brother (who at the time was 12) and I used to roleplay and record ourselves playing the parts of Jason and victim. We were so cheesy, but we loved doing it.I'm not picky about any of the Friday the 13th's. Everyone says the same thing about A New Beginning or Jason Takes Manhattan, but I loved 'em just as much as the ones that came before and after them. Jason kicked ass 24 yrs ago and still kicks ass today.I very fairly give every single Friday the 13th in this set a 10/10, because I'm such a die hard fan! I love this box set, because now I have every Friday the 13th movie on DVD (I-X, plus Freddy vs. Jason)."
3,What A Joke!!!,"I am very, very disappointed with this boxset, first where are all the uncut versions?? Are we ever going to get Part 3 in 3-D?? Paramount needs to sell these movies to New Line so that they can put out a proper boxset with everything the fans have been wanting for years. The extras on Disc 5 are just horrible and the commentaries are boring. There is already an uncut version of the first Friday the 13th so why isn't that in this set??? Everyone save your money and wait for the uncut versions!"
1,"The STUPIDEST STUPIDEST STUPIDEST STUPIDEST, MOST POINTLESS batch of movies ever made","Holy crap, this doesn't even deserve an analytical review, it just goes firmly beyond all boundaries of taste. This is mass produced tripe that sees sequel after sequel all based on the sales the last title brought in. I love horror but I do like a tiny bit of plot and some originality to the killing scenes."
1,Eh.,"Not nearly as good as the Halloween series. Atleast Michael Myers got hurt every now and then. He gets shot goes down for a bit, gets up, continues killing,whereas nothing affects Jason. I've seen some horrible, disgusting, vile things happen to Jason, but he never dies. He should have died after the like 4th,or 5th one. Michael Myers much, better, Halloween is classic."
4,classic 1980s horror movies,I grew up watch these movies and I still enjoy watch them around halloween each years and all these are in wide screen. I am glad Jason goes to hell is not in this collection and oh boy did new cine really mess up the movie series. But Jason should have possble die after part four.
5,Collectables,"What i liked about this set is the package, 8 great films, extras, and a cool box with cool artwork. The spooky atmosphere makes these films. I recommend this box to anyone. My favourite movies are pts 1-4. Pt 1 - 3 brings me back to my youth and the DVD transfers are fine, if you are after something intelligent, this is not for you, for the films are a fun and entertaining session of good-looking horny teens getting slashed. I think the series went a bit far after pt 8, but what the hell its all popcorn stuff anyway. For all the people bagging Paramount GET A LIFE this box is beautifully put together, (like how many times do you need to see Jason do the sleeping bag thing)??????? I have read all the reviews and im amazed no-one noticed how annoyingly DARK the picture is on Part 1.If anyone is interested in Friday the 13th collectables, email taylor5821@hotmail.com"
4,From Crystal Lake 2 Manhattan,"The eight movies done while the franchise was under Paramount Studios are left in tact. Two movies per disk, with the fifth disk having an eight part chronicle (one for each movie), and other special features. I would really love to give this five stars, but I still don't know what happened to Paul at the end of Part 2. I was hoping that his death scene would be one of the deleted scenes included on the 5th disk, but it was not."
4,Nothing compared to Halloween but still good,I have never been a big Friday the 13th fan but I decided to pick this up when it was on sale at best buy. It is not the greatest box set there should have been more features. The few commentaries that they had were not that great either. But the special features that they do have on the bonus disc were great. And you buy it for the movies anyway.The 8 movies are on 4 discs part 1-2 the first disc and so on. Anyway if your a fan of the series pick this up and you cant buy most of the movies in the store now anyway. But I sill would recomend the Halloween movies over this anyday.
2,"I am so very, very disappointed.","I saw this box set release and was super-excited because I thought ""at last, the uncut movies!"" I have heard so much about scenes cut, particularly from the original and from #7, especially a scene in a toolshed with telekinetic girl flinging some deadly ""tools"" around. Fans want the uncut flicks. Why bother otherwise? Each movie is available at a low price already, so just pick and choose your favorites (for me, 1,2,4,7 and--hate me now--Jason Goes to Hell, which I love!) AND at least New Line made the uncut version available on DVD. Paramount,you suck!"
2,Was it worth the wait,You either love the series or hate the series. Either way Jason will go down as the biggest horror icn of all time. I don't know whether to be excited or be dissapoited with this box set. There will only be 4 discs to it and no deletes scenes or unrated editions to the movie. This kind of seems like a half ass job from paramount. The movies aren't that great either. 1-3 are okay but after that it kind of gets ridiculous.Jason and Manhattan come on.I rather wach Gigli than that movie.Or better yet even the house of the dead than that movie. That was the worse one by far. Its like the writers weren't even trying after part 3. It always has the same plot.Teens go camping. Teens have sex and then teens die because they had sex. It got pretty lame. Should you buy it? Maybe if they throw in a free tee shirt you can consider on buying this poor collectors edition. Not cool Paramount. Maybe Paramount should wait another ten years to release it.
3,Nice...........But could be ALOT better,"This would be a great DVD boxed set, for any fan that doesnt already own the first eight classic Friday the 13th films that have already been released on dvd. But for the hardcore FANatics, such as myself, it's quite a disappointment. I got the set, pretty much for the 5th disc which supposedly had over 10 hours of bonus features. It eve says there are over 10 hours of bonus features right on the box itself. If I were to estimate the bonus features, including the trailers, id say its not even 2 hours. And I was hoping to see loads of stars from all the films, which didnt happen. In all the interviews, maybe 10 or less stars,of the series, were interviewed. So save your money folks!"
3,decent box set,"Not to sound like I'm complain or anything but these aren't remastered and the only good thing is the bonus disc.They should release a deluxe edition box set.Especialy with 3d glasses for 3.That would be true value for the buck.Instead Paramount wants you to dish out cash for all individualy.To be extremely honest the only good ones were the first few anyway.So,a special edition box set would be well worth dishing out the extra bucks."
1,Friday the 13th dvd boxset,"This box set is a joke ,Paramount(as usual) disrespects the actors and filmakers who put thier blood,sweat and tears, making these horror classics, by releasing video tape quality on dvd. Every one of these films had to be cut numerous times to avoid an X-rating. WHERES all the footage?the sound quality is a joke(most mono sound ,some in 2.0)these films made(and is still making)upward of $850 million dollars domestically. Paramount like every other film company,released thier movie on dvd as quickly as possible, then maybe they will release a high quality version later (how many times has Jaws been released).Dont waste your money buying this set, hell dont even rent it. Maybe hollywood will quit screwing the public over with thier numerous ""Special Editions"" and do whats right."
3,I think I was ripped off...,"A few people have brought this up already, but there are only the edited versions of these films. Sometimes, they don't even show the deaths of certain characters, they just don't show them for the remainder of the movie which just leaves you feeling like there's something missing. I truly hope they put out a complete and unrated version set of this collection. These movies were the source of some sleepless nights as a kid and I'm still fascinated with series. Of all the horror icons, Jason was one of the greats.The picture quality of this set is pretty good, decent packaging, so-so extras. Overall, just an incomplete collection."
4,it will do,"i was all about hating this set from day 1......it really does seem like a half ass attempt.....the disc sharing, the flippies....lack of lengendary extras...us fans know a great boxset....look at the alien quadrilogy....amazing. BUT im such a jason fan i say, ya know....this will do....i own all jason flicks on vhs, and i did get around to buying a few of the overpriced dvd releases.....and ya know, those have served just what they should...the movie...so when i compare just the movie to even the slightest extra or new box art i feel this Set is worth the money to horror fans. paramount is only doing this for the money...and we all know there ashamed of the Jason character....but what are ya gonna do. i want these movies in any fashion possible....if even better cuts are to be released in 3 years, u bet im buying those too."
5,Best Horror Movies Ever,"It is about time that this came out in a box set. When they released the Nightmare series in a box set, i was waiting for this to do the same thing. This is a better set of movies than nightmare. It is about time."
2,pitiful ...,"Ok, I just have one question for the people that made this collectors box. Why the [...] did you not include that last 2 movies?!? and what is with the double feature discs!!! honestly. You know, with ALL the films, with each one getting its own disc. THANK GOD I had the nerves NOT to buy the Friday The 13th set. And I SERIOUSLY hope that they remake this box set, REALLY making it a collectors edition."
4,Dramatic insight into the experiences of young men in war,"Chris Cocks writes from the heart about his shocking experiences of the Rhodesian War. Sucked in by the naive ""glory"" of fighting for a worthy but misguided cause, this book offers the reader a compelling account of the glory and horror of young men caught up in apocalyptic events beyond their control. I was a school colleague of Chris Cocks and lost a number of friends in this pointless war. This book is the best account I have read of this sort. It is a ""must"" for anyone who occasionally needs to be reminded that behind the glory of war lies for ever the ever-powerful trauma-inducing horror of wasted life and resources."
2,Does not stick,The dots are OK but will not stay stuck to any paper I have used. They end up all over the place if rolled up. Save your money and buy a red marking pen.
2,Cortiblock Results,Not all that effective. Dampened my hungar just a little bit for only a short time. Not so sure it's worth it.
1,didn't work,"didn't work at all. in fact, gain weight with it. I ordered two packets and have seen no reduction in appetite or pounds."
2,A novelty at best,"Watching the videos of this item being used, I couldn't' resist and I bought it. I didn't read the fine print though and it needed a heat regulator to go with it as well. Well after I bought the item and used it I found that it was not easy to use and was tedious when switching colors. It is basically a soldering iron that someone has welded the flow basin onto. The biggest problem I had is that the pointed flow regulator at the bottom of the basin, if you had any wax layers at all, would melt that layer as the wax was laid down on the painting. This is great if that is what you are trying to achieve but useless if you just want a single line of encaustic medium. Too much to spend on an item that you may use seldom at best."
5,Freddie and the Frenchfries,"I bought this book for my nephew, who doesn't like to read. Well, he called to tell me he was on page 15, and he was bringing it to the beach so he could continue reading it. I think this says it all."
5,quite interesting...highly recommended,"Most UFOs can be explained away, and science tells us that it is highly unlikely anyone will visit us, so what about the % that aren't explained? Most of these are found to be rooted in the occult and as this book shows, are quite similar, if not identical, to documented encounters/interactions with demons."
3,Not bad.,"Not bad,not as good as the first.If they came out with a new album I would have to hear a sample of it before I bought it because it seams like they were heading more into a mainstream sound, radio friendly kinda S#@t.You don't here on this cd,Preety cool,Yea it rocks.All in all like I said before not bad at all.Later."
5,The book quickly becomes an old friend....Smitty,"The book details you'll find above, now let me tell you the good part. This is one of those books you like having with you night and day, at a stop light, while your wife tells you about her day....you can get lost in this book...how very pleasant. It flows so freely with no lost ideas, actors who do a stage left never to be heard of again.This guy Mirsky is more then a author, he's a Storyteller and I'd pay big dollars to set around his camp fire any night.....smitty"
4,Solid Historical Fiction,"Mr Mirsky has been tagged a relentless self promoter. Maybe that's true- I did receive a solicitous email from him askimg me to purchase the book. However, I had already bought it a year ago, and I must thank him for his e-mail. It prompted me to pick it up and take a look. What a great surprise. This marks probably the 10th self-published work I've bought on Amazon, and I have yet to be disappointed. Take a chance on Mirsky and travel back in time to the age of viking exploration. It's well worth it."
5,An Epic Saga,"This is a great piece of historical fiction, making you feel as if you were there. This book's originality is refreshing, Mirsky captures the writing style of the old Norse Saga's. The only thing that sets this apart from the Norse Saga's is the amount of detail Mirsky uses."
4,Interesting Viking Saga,"Written in the simple style of the early Viking sagas, this book succeeds as a sweeping historical drama. I highly recommend it to all those who have an interest in the Norsemen or those like a good adventure yarn."
4,Authentic Portrayal of Early Norse Life and Exploration,"I read this novel immediately after reading Never Grow Old: The Novel of Gilgamesh, and what a refreshing change of pace. While the Gilgamesh adaption was absurd in the knowledge and characteristics ascribed to early Sumerian civilization, this work read very true to the actual experiences and challenges faced by the early Norse settlers of Greenland and its surrounding environs.Our protagonist, a ""black sheep"" grandson of the great explorer Leif Ericsson, seeks to validate his claim as rightful heir to Ericsson's discovery of Vinland (present day Newfoundland). In doing so, he must battle the elements, his kinsmen and the natives of the new land (Skraeling).While some may be put off by the somewhat unusual writing style employed by the author, I found it refreshing and reminiscent of the period."
2,"Weak, do not buy","Really not engaging. Want to read something better? Try Guy gavriel Kay's recent book Last Kingdom, or Bernard Cornwell's recent books on Alfred the Great. Or better yet, find the Deepest Sea, by Charles Barnitz. Those books are amazing."
5,The beginnings of America?,"This book, once you get into the story, is very intriging. It is a little hard to get used to the prose it is written in, but keep going and you are hooked. It is often said that the Norsemen discovered America, and after reading his book, I could believe it and the hardships that took place must have been unbearable by todays standards. He keeps all the characters and relationships moving, and is interesting up to the very end. Too bad there wasn't a sequel written."
5,Rare and Wonderful Adventure,"The King of Vinland, alias Sigtrygg, moves through this book with the swagger of the Gladiator, the charm of Captain Blood and the romantic sensibilties of George Clooney! What a guy.His dogged determination to get what is rightfully his keeps you turning page after page. The characters are beautifully drawn. Because of the unique voice Mr. Mirsky uses, each one has a life of their own and they leap off the pages. One of those great books that you have to keep reading but hate to finish!"
4,Great summer reading,"This is a great book to bring to the beach or curl up with on a cold winter's night. Mr. Mirsky has a talent for telling an adventure tale. Stories like this, and the ability to write them well, may have been been easier to come by before the age of movies and television. It's nice to see someone with talent and a sense of adventure.A story like this depends on plot and character. The story reminds one of a Saturday morning serial, but at a pace more suited for the written word. The characters come alive through their dialog. Mr. Mirsky shows exceptional craftmanship in writing quasi-period dialog. It's neither intrusive nor pretentious.It's nice to see someone is still writing books like this. I can't wait for the next one."
4,Love the brand but not the price here,"Being lazy, I ordered this via Amazon in bulk, but then I just found out I could have went to one of the big box stores and get it for about $6 a roll, so I overpaid here. Works as designed. Easy to apply on and take off without leaving residue."
1,is like what you buy at the store,"I use this tape all of the time, and thought buying bulk would save some time and a bit of cost. But the performance of this tape is horrible! it rips when you try to take it off the role, its hard to use, and you just want to throw the roll away. I don't know why this stuff doesn't perform, but save yourself the grief and buy yours locally at the hardware store."
4,AMW-,"this was the first Salvatore book that I read. I greatly enjoyed it. I liked Artemis Entreris character and enjoyed reading of the emotional warfare Wulfgar has wihtin. I would strongly recommend this book for a first time reader of Salvatore. If you like this book, then you just might enjoy andy David Gemmell--particularly Hero In the Shadows.----Rest In Peace Mr. Gemmell"
3,It was Okay,"I thought it was a decent book, but definitley not one of Salvatore's best works. Some of the actions taken by the characters did not seem to fall in line with the personalities that Salvatore had developed for them throughout the series, but you still need to read it if you plan to keep following the storyline just so you will not get behind."
5,salvatore's best yet!,"I have read every single r.a. salvatore book about Drizzt Do'Urden and I've gotta say this book is the best yet. Though I do agree with other readers that the ""companions of the hall"" need some new adventures. I love salvatores books he is my favorite author but passage to dawn wasn't that good. But r.a. really came back hard with this book! It just like the first novel he wrote. full of action and intrigue. I can't wait for the spine of the world to come out!"
3,Good--but not one of his better books.,"I couldn't wait to buy this book, and even though it was not one of Salvatore's better FR books, I would probably still buy it. The story line was a bit hoakey, and the constant misspelling of Lloth as Lolth throughout the book distracted me every time I saw it."
5,"SILENT BLADE......Mr. Salvatore....a movie sir, a movie!","What can I say to help someone better understand the book....READ ALL THE OTHERS FIRST. I read SILENT BLADE, and it made me want to pick up all the others of Drizzt & Co. and read them all over again. What I am wondering is why some big time screen producer has not jumped on this yet? If I had Lucas or Spielberg's movie making prowess, I would be all over this like black on a Drow Elf! This has got STAR WARS potential all over it (not to say Mr. Salvatore should sell out) but this is great stuff. READ THIS BOOK, then buy the others and read them if you haven't. Preferably buy them first then buy this one...I read Streams of Silver before I read The Crystal Shard. Mr. Salvatore, your the greatest, keep it up...."
2,"While I'm a fan of Salvatore's books, this was disappointing","I'm a long-time fan of all of Salvatore's books, especially the Dark Elf series. This one, though, left much to be desired. I felt that Salvatore knew where he wanted the story to go, and forced the characters and events to bend to fit his ideas. Several of the major characters didn't act in accordance with the way their personalities were developed in the earlier books. While the basic storyline was okay, it was also weak; there really wasn't much going on in the entire book. While I will probably be buying the next book simply because I'm hooked on the series, I will be profoundly disappointed if it's a soap-opera like The Silent Blade."
4,Not to bad,Not the best of the series but not terrible. Will continue reading the series that if for sure. Sellswords next.
5,A stunning twenty year journey.,"R.A. Salvatore is amazing in his descriptive breadth and creating deep worlds filled with excitement. I first started this series @ 10 years old during a rough age and haven't looked back. Now @ 30, it is still as fantastic as ever.One of my favorite authors and some of the best characters ever to walk in my minds eye.THANK YOU R.A. SALVATORE!!! A true joy for many years."
4,Good read!,"A well paced novel true to the spirit of the series. It has a good blend of action, character building, and a story that captures the imagination from beginning to end."
5,Excellent,I am currently reading the legend of drizzt books. I started from the beginning. This one is excellent! The downloads was immediate and there have been no glitches.
3,One of Salvatores worst books!,"I found that this book had to many plot lines going. The thing about the love triangle is getting very stupid and stupid. Why doesn't Drizzt go for someone else like Lady of Silvermoon. I did like, however, like the final fight between Drizzt and Entreri. This fight was very exciting and action packed. Jarlaxe was a great character to add to this story. He gave it alot more suspense and some humor. The book was to short to completly develope the characters and to give a good complete ending. Wulfgar character development has to be worked on.PLEASE SALVATORE DO NOT LEAVE US HANGING."
4,"Brawls, swordplays, and a whole lot of suspense!!","I loved the book, as I do all of Salvatore's books, but this one had some dry spots. I really felt that the focus of this book was on the next book. So many things were setup for a sequel, but no closure was provided. There was just to many loose ends left dangling. As usual the fight sequences were beyond belief. The way Salvatore has brought in the characters from his other novels is also very intriguing. The suspense in this book was to die for too. Keep writing and I'll keep reading, but the book should not be about setting up another novel, but about the story at hand."
3,Almost there.,"I took one star off because of drizzt's almost secondary role in this book. He's too great a character to be put on the back burner like that. The second star was taken off for a combination of three reasons. 1)Wulfgar is back. while it was interesting at first to see a man realize his mistakes and change, the constant rehashing of the same old problem (OH..I suck. I'll change.) has started to bore me. 2)the book is to short. 'nuff said. 3)Salvator keeps on putting the same old enemies in Drizzt's path. It's time to move on to some new and improved demented phycopaths for Drizzt to fight.Since Wulfgar IS back,(sigh)It would be great to have him and Catti-brie mary off. (after she has a brief fling with Drizzt, of course.) Also, I think it's time for Drizzt move off on his own and gain some new friends. (Elminster anyone?) I loved the book and thought it had plenty of adventure, and I will certainly buy upcomming Drizzt Novels. Thanx."
4,Very well written,R.A. Salvatore is one of my favorite fantasy authors and his novels pertaining to the on going saga of Drizz't Do'Urden are some of the greatest novels out there. The Silent Blade is Salvatores most recent installment and as can be expected it was wonderful. The story was great and suspensfull and I thoroughly enjoyed it despite the fact that it kind of leaves you hanging.
3,Typical.,"While I did enjoy The Slient Blade, there was nothing new. Personally I believe this could have been a much better book had Salvatore spend more time on it and made it longer. I have always felt that Drizzt books were too short but this was by far the one book that should have been at least 100-200 pages longer. Bob should have spent more time on Wulfgar and his trouble, coming to some kind of conclusion. There should have been more plot also, involving Drizzt, Catti-brie, Brenour, and Regis. I was very disappointed in the lack of action and storyline involving Drizzt. He is after all the main hero. Reguardless as to how pleased I am or am not about this book, this is the only one of the 11 I have been less than satisfied. So believe me, I would keep on reading!"
4,Very good!,"This latest installement in the Drizzt series was very good. I liked it a lot, but the plot was a little weak. Not only that, but the end was left open for another book. I like the book immensely but I wish it had been a little more developed. Now, where's the next one?"
2,Jarlaxle and Zaknafien....friends?,"Wow. In DET I loved Zaknafien's character, brooding and violent without being whiney. I was p.o-ed when he was killed him, then resurrected him, then killed him again. I would love to see a book about him and Jarlaxle. Other than that this book didn't thrill me much, the writing was good but I 'm not crazy over Wulfgar."
3,Dear B. Salvatore,"I would like to see more of Jarlaxle,and Enteri. A three or two book series on the life, struggles, and reasons for their present outlook on life would be great, much like the Dark Elf Trilogy. A story from the perspective of a character such as jarlaxle or Entreri woud be unique and would shed specific light on their past, which I have always been interested in. Such a story would be a big seller. In this novel I thought that the conflict between Drizzt and Entreri would finally be resolved, but was somewhat disipointed when Entreri manages(through luck) to survive once again. The deal with wulfgar is not a bad idea, not all heroes can a happy ending to their trials. I think Drizzt is one of my favorite heroes of contemporary literature. He has very strong character, he seems to be able to look into an individuals heart and judge them for their actions and their empathy and respect for others."
3,Drizzt improvised??,"True to most Salvatore fans, I await each novel with much anticipation. That could be the reason why this novel did not live up to such high expectation.I believe Salvatore can do better. The Dark Elf Trilogy changed me big time. Although set in a fantasy world, it was believable and really drew one into the storyline. In fact, I can hardly believe that Drizzt is not a real person. My suggestion to Salvatore is this - let Drizzt live. He is alive, grow his character. Does he enjoy travelling? Is his potential reached? Any quests he can embark on which isn't driven by a strong moral obligation? (An unwilling hero is the best one).So many possibilities. Can't it be better?"
3,"Disappointing, but still good","This book started out well. I liked the mini storylines. However the Wulfgar sub-plot just wasn't interesting. Most of the fighting, while well discribed, was just the same ol' same ol' repetitive dribble. Bringing Jarlaxle back into the series was a good idea. Drizzt played a minor role in this one. But it is good to see character developement, espesally with Entreri. This was a good book, but it just didn't feel like the old Drizzt novels. Mainly because the only one in this book who didn't do any brooding, was Drizzt. I was very disappointed by the ending. I don't want to give it away, but cliffhangers get annoying after about 11 novels"
5,Another Great Adventure,"Bob....You need to keep writing...because you left us hanging again!! I finished ""The Silent Blade"" and I loved every page. The twists and turns of the story just kept the pages turning. I was rather shocked in the final chapter when...I won't ruin it for everyone that hasn't read it. Mr. Salvatore, please don't take so long writing the sequel to this one!"
5,The Best!,"One word...WOW! Bob Salvatore has impressed me once again with his lasted novel from Forgotten Realms. To say that this novel does not dissappoint is an understatement. The three interweaving storylines are masterfully written and come together wonderfully. The characters once again garb your attention and pull you into their dilemas in a way that no other writer of fantasy, besides the great Tolkien, has ever done. I congradutlate Salvatore on perhaps the greates Drizzt novel to date."
4,It's great as usual,"I loved the book. It's excellent as are all of Salvatore's books.The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because someone is really slipping up in the editorial part of the book process. It just makes it seem like a rushed book to have so many glaring grammatical errors. It seems to be becoming a more common occurrence with his books.Other than that, the book is a must read for anyone who is following the series or even the author."
2,Disappointing,"Well I was really disappointed with this book. I love the characters and I was looking forward to reading about them again. But in this book they seemed comical and lacked true depth with the exception of Artemis. Although I was hoping the assassin would some how find redemption. Perhaps Salvatore is leaving that open for another series, I hope so. Overall I wouldn't recommend this book, although the fight scene between Drizzt and Artemis had a clever twist."
3,Another Typical Dark Elf Outing- Nothing Special,"I enjoy Mr. Salvatore's books as much as the next person however the same tired plot devices and flashbacks that have been seen in the past few books crop up again. The same phrases are used again and again. Uneeded background material is rehashed. Unceasing internal monolouges, teen angst even, continue to flow from the main character. A good read but I believe R.A. needs to move on and invest effort in some new Forgotten Realms Characters."
2,Too much repetions of the charactors emotions,"I have enjoyed all the previous works but this book took me the longest to finish. Why? Because I got tired of reading the same things over and over again about the memories of the charactors. I got bored. The book needs more new ideas. The charactors should 'move on' and only think about the past once a while, not after every other chapter. And also please don't explain everything that happened in previous books so often. I hope the next book will be good enough for me to finish it in one session."
4,Good continuation of the trilogies; disappointing end,"I have to agree with several other reviews in that the ending left much to desire. It's unfortunate that Salvatore had to complete the book within a fixed number of pages because the potential of the story could have easily been twice the length. Development between the characters are unfolding nicely though for future books to come. If you're an avid Salvatore fan, like myself, don't hesitate to read it. I welcome any email discussions about it."
4,MORE ARTEMIS!,"I loved the book but not because of the good guy. Artemis was the star. If Salvatore is reading this.... PLEASE WRITE A BOOK ABOUT ARTEMIS ONLY! About his past. Things he learned. Oh yeah, I especially liked the fight between Artemis and the other assassin in the street."
3,Catt's admirer,"I really liked this book in the fact that Drizzt is finally realizing that is feelings for Cattie-Brie run deeper than just friendship, and he finally realizes what the word jealousy really means when Wulfgar comes back into everyones life. I don't think the book is terribley good except for the first about 7 chapters or so."
3,"A throwback to old school Drizzt, indeed!","Ever since Starless Night, these character's haven't been as compelling. I was hoping for some kind of redemption for Artemis, but Salavatore knows how to keep a good thing going. I do think Wulfgar is a much more sympathetic character now that he's a drunk. Also Catie-Brie has never been interesting. She's the one who should die."
2,"Go back to hell, Wulfgar.","I got all excited upon the return of Wulfgar... and when he finally comes back, he's whiny, stupid and moody. This book reads like a friggin' soap opera! If I wanted that, I could watch daytime TV!I really hope that everybody gets their ""stuff"" together in the next book (Which I hear is actually more of Wulfgar's whinings) and goes back to the good ole' days like in the Crystal Shard where everybody is fighting against evil critters instead of complaining amongst themselves all the time."
5,Another Great R.A. book,"although i was disappointed with the noticable lack of Drizzt, this was still another great book by Salvatore which continues the long line of books usually focusing on the dark elf, but oh well."
1,IF ONLY I COULD GIVE NEGATIVE STARS........,ARGH! I PAID ALL THAT MONEY TO READ A BOOK ABOUT WULGAR? WHAT A LOAD! THIS IS THE LAST SALVATORE BOOK I READ
1,THE SILENT DUD......MOST OF THE BOOK IS ABOUT WULFGAR,THIS BOOK HAS A LOT OF WORDS....BUT SAYS NOTHING
1,To all you Salvatore sycophants out there who can't...,"...understand the criticism of this book you see here. First of all, have you ever played D&D? Have you read a significant number of Forgotten Realms books? If you have, you will easily see how Salvatore's novels have become more and more poorly written. The novels he has churned out recently have become extremely shallow and have the character depth of a nursery rhyme. His fall from the excellent writing in the Dark Elf Trilogy make this even more tragic.If you are entertained by a shallow, superfluous story about characters that are now only characterized by the clothes they wear and the weapons they carry, I understand your rave review of Salvatore's recent attempts. They can certainly be entertaining to early and pre-teens.I highly recommend exploring the immersion in the Realms that OTHER authors can provide."
3,Entreri is back again... and again... and again...,"He's the assassin that just kept on going. Like the Energizer bunny, he seems to go on forever, never stopping, never relenting, until he can get just one (or ten) more chances to kill our favorite Drow Ranger. Or maybe he just wants a few more of Regis' fingers for a new necklace.So what does this mean? I'm not willing to pre-judge the book, as I generally like Salvatore's works. But I don't like Entreri. IMO, he's had his chance, and should have died long ago.So I'll give this one the same chance I give all books by ""The Bob""."
3,"Sorry, but I thought it was boring!","I love Drizzt and have read almost everything Salvatore has published...but The Silent Blade was a let down. It was incredibly boring and predictable. I know that Salvatore doesn't want to hear this, but I bought the book to read about Drizzt...not Wulfgar. The Wulfgar/Cattibri/Drizzt love triangle is way too old. Why not give Drizzt someone else to be interested if you are going to keep silly drunk testosterone boy Wulfgar around for Cattibri. I did like the psychological battle that Artemis was having... and the way Jarlaxle took advantage of it. Other than that, I felt the same way Drizzt did when confronted with another battle. It's really pointless."
4,Excellent book! Sub-par ending!,"This book is a masterpiece for 90% of the story. However, the ending left me empty. You cannot end a novel abruptly in just one long chapter. It is obvious that there will be more books to come but this one could have ended much better. Salvatore is one of the best writters in the field and I still think he has what it takes to write a good book. The whole Artemis Drizzt fight was great but it ended stupid. R.A.'s best works are the Icewind Dale Trilogy and the Dark Elf Trilogy. So far, every hardcover book was a bit of a dissapointment. Four Stars for me would be great, but for Salvatore, it is sub-par."
4,A great book,"I have loved RA salvatore since i was 11 years old and he has only improved since then. He has always had great plots and lots of action to keep you interested while that plot develops, and he definitly accomplished that goal with this book. And while it was heart breaking what happened to Wulfgar without plot twist like that the book would be pointless. My only advice would be a book COMPLETELY centered on Artemis. He is a great character and hopefully he does not accept the fate laid out by jarlaxe because he would be extremely limited by that. Lastly a comment on the only real problem with any of the Drizzt books, why is regis there?! He does nothing interesting and does not fit into the group. I like regis as a character i just think his ""antics"" would have brought him a lot of scorn from his friends. Not the best Salvatore book ever but definitly sets up awsome possibilities for new books. I love RA Salvatore!"
3,Not quite what I expected,"At first I couldn't put the book down. I could feel the different plots intertwining and thickening. Around page 300 I felt as if the book would never end(which I wouldn't mind.) As always I appreciate the extremely detailed battles and the focus on many different characters. I felt the ending was somewhat odd and dissapointing, that Drizzt would so easily forgive and even thank Jarlaxle. I missed the adventures of Drizzt and co. but I'm definetly looking forward to the next one and I hope that the saga never dies."
1,A Waste of Time!,This book is rather weak and interesting in that it the author does not develop any true support or information on the subject matter covered. It is misleading because the motive is clearly racial in nature.
4,I received this book just in time! It's in fine condition. Thanks!,"I received this book just in time to do my first Homework assignment.It's in fine condition. I think I'm gonna keep it after this class is over, thats how much I like the stories within it!!!"
3,"Good as a map, but not much else","I bought this atlas expecting it to have some more information on the parks and recreation shown on the maps...but no such luck. There is very little information on the parks aside from a list of where they are. The atlas also doesn't contain things like Ski hills, or other forms of recreation...just conservation areas and provincial parks."
5,Very good quality ankle weights,"I bought these mainly to get in shape a bit, while im jogging or working out. The Velcro straps help the ease of taking them on and off in a jiff. just so you know, the description says it comes with 10 weight bars, but that is for one ankle bracer. The whole set comes with twenty, ten on each ankle."
5,Exactly what I wanted,I ordered these weights to wear while working out and found myself wearing them all day while I was at work too. They've been a great purchase.
5,lovely book,"We gave this book as a Christmas gift to an uncle who had recently taken a trip to Ireland. He loved the book, and started flipping through immediately. It has breath taking photos and lots of good reading. We definately recommend!"
5,sehr zufrieden,"Eine schnelle Lieferung, und alles ok,werde gerne wieder bei diesem Verkäufer bestellen, Preis Leistung vor allem die Qualität stimmt . Besten Dank"
5,Over Ireland - Beautiful!!!,"We got to watch ""Over Ireland"" on PBS one day and abslutely loved it. I have always wanted to go to Ireland and have an Irish heritage. My brother was able to go a few years ago. He just passed away three days after Christmas. He LOVED Ireland so much; was into history and was planning on going back some day for another visit. He had seen ""Over Ireland"" and thought it was awesome, too. I particulary LOVE the song at the end ""I Will"". It is the most beautiful song I have ever heard. I wish there was a cd available with that song and others on it by the same artist. But I believe that song was an original song written for this DVD. I can't find any CD's by that artist. Anyway, I purchased this DVD in order to feel closer to my late brother. This DVD is well done and will be the closest I will ever get to Ireland."
1,Disappointed,"I am not sure what I was expecting, but I was disappointed overall. The aerial photography was good.....that which you could see without a blur. I sense there was a need to cram too much into too short a time frame.I have been to Ireland several times and actually flew over parts in a private plane. I had a much better view than what this video presented as the pilot was so high, many things were indistinguishable. Ergo, many of the ruins and buildings were not captured in their true size. Add to this, there was little or no dialogue about many of the sights.I don't like to be critical of people's endeavors, but neither do I like spending money on something I did not enjoy. I ended up trying the video a 2nd time in bed. On low volume, I went sounded to sleep listening to the ""New Age"" music."
1,Over Ireland [Blu-ray],"Buyers beware! I purchased 3 new DVD's and there is a sound problem with the video. The pictures are beautiful, but the sound breaks up on and off continuously. Note: I have a new Blu-Ray player and all of my other DVD's work perfectly."
5,The journey of a worker bee entrenched in the mindless tedium of life in the melodrone honeybee colony,"To Bee Or Not To Bee: A Book For Beeings Who Feel There's More To Life Than Making Honey by John Penberthy is an illustrated, inspiration metaphor with a fun and spiritually sophisticated theme. To Bee Or Not To Bee is about the journey of a worker bee entrenched in the mindless tedium of life in the melodrone honeybee colony. Filled with clever aphorisms, To Bee Or Not To Bee teaches that the only way out is in, that the greatest present is the present, and that life is a journey from I to we. Highly recommended for spiritually inclined readers who seek more than they have been able to find in traditional religion, as well as an excellent gift."
5,A Book for All Ages...,To Bee or Not to Bee is a book that children will understand immediately. Adults will understand it more slowly as it pricks their minds and souls. We can each find our own land of milk and honey when we follow Buzz's example to bee present with ourselves.
4,Make sure you have the correct length!,"Denso is a direct fit for your Chrysler vehicle. Only problem is that Amazon said this would work for the upstream sensor on my 1996 Dodge Ram truck. It is not Amazons fault because all other Auto Parts websites said the same thing. I ordered it and found out it is about 2 inches too short. It has a wire length of 12 inches. My original is about 14 inches long. I found out that there is an alternate part of 234-4076. It is the exact same part but it has a 18 inch wire length with the same pigtail (it was another option I could of used but did not know about). The 234-4076 fit great and works great also. I loved the extra 4 inches of wire to work with. If you don't have the option of taking out your original and measuring the wire length, order the 234-4076. You can thank me later!"
3,Set is cool/packaging is cheap,"The package this came in was open faced, so if you want to give this as a gift, you might want to buy it from a physical store. The edges of the package were destroyed."
4,Charcoal Companion Golf BBQ Tool Set,Looked to be of good quality. It also looked a little on the large size. My son-n-law liked it as a Christmas gift.
5,Great product,"Cute! Fun! Love it. Appeared to be good quality, though it was a gift for someone else, so I haven't used it. The receiver liked it though."
4,Good show!,"I needed a fix or something to watch (while I'm waiting for ""The Walking Dead"" to return in the fall) and so far, this series is keeping me occupied. I still haven't found a show as good as ""Lost"", but these are in the ballpark. It's full of action, has a little romance (just a little) and makes you think about the society we live in and if this could really happen. I would recommend this."
5,"Relevant to Economic Armageddon, too","A national crisis forces a small Kansas town to focus on the basics -- food, fuel, family, friends.Jericho is a well-executed, thought-provoking, sometimes chilling and mysterious series."
5,Excellant Product,I am througly enjoying Jerico the complete season. I bought it new and will enjoy it for many years to come
5,It's not fiction!,"I watched this program on Netflix and was so glad to be able to purchase it for my home library. It is so realistic and I pray not prophetic for our USA but I can honestly see it happening in the very near future. I am sorry the show was discontinued and wish the network would pick it up again!Excellent show with a great script and awesome actors/directors!Intense, and thought provoking."
3,JERRICO,"I HAD PREVIOUSLY WATCHED THIS EXCELLENT SERIES, I ENJOYED IT ENOUGH THAT I WANTED TO HAVE IT IN MY COLLECTION, TO WATCH AGAIN AND AGAIN, I WAS UNHAPPY THAT THEY KEPT REVIEWING THE PREVIOUS EPISODES, BUT I CAN LIVE WITH THAT... I WAS A LITTLE UPSET THAT THEY LEFT PIECES OUT THAT WAS IN THE ORIGINAL...BUT WAS REAL HAPPY WITH YOUR SERVICE....I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR THE MOVIE,LADY SOMETHING, ELIZA DOLITTLE WAS THE COCKNEY LADY, REX HARRISON THE PROFESSOR.. THANKS AGAIN....HARRY KELLEY"
5,Jericho - The Complete Series,"I am a fan of Skeet Ulrich; he was perfect for the leading character in the series. The rest of the cast like Lennie James,were very well suited to their roles and you developed a strong tie to them as people. With the state of the world at this point in time the plot of this story makes you think about the possiblity that this catastrophe could happen and makes you hope that heroes of these calibre will arise to the challenge of leading us though to survival."
5,Jericho is Awesome!,"This was the best series I have ever watched! Every episode left you on a cliffhanger, so we had to watch the next until we absolutely had to go to bed! It is scary because a similar scenario could actually happen, and it makes you think about how life would be if it did!"
4,"Great set, but not worth buying if you already have another Jericho DVD set.","Jericho is certainely a very good show, both seasons are great. But as of this set, it's nothing more than a cartboard cover housing the previously released sets of Seasons 1 & 2 plus a bonus disc in a tiny cardboard case. The new features are not that much interesting. The only valuable reason to buy this set is if it's cheaper to buy this instead of the individual sets. Otherwise, forget the new special features and get Season 1 & 2 separetely."
5,The Best!,"I rarely ever review DVD's, but I am making an exception for Jericho. This complete first season is absolutely the best! It was the best show on TV - have you ever noticed how the best shows are always cancelled early?????The storyline is smart, quick and non-stop action. I love this show because it actually asks the audience to think!!!The DVD is very well made - the sound and pictures are great. This is one of the best buys around."
5,Jericho The Complete Series,"For Jericho fans, this is the absolute best. The extras are awesome and the only thing missing is SEASON Three which the network did not see fit to continue. Highly recommend the set."
5,Incredible thought-provoking series!,"Very few TV series impress me (ReGenesis comes to mind) but this offers a fine story, realistic characters, and high production quality."
5,Great movie!,"Loved the series, missed a few episodes so purchased the set. Very happy with it. Came all in it's brand new packaging, excellent condition, fast shipping, great show! Highly recommend!"
2,Horrible,"Really bad reception to my radio and very cheaply made. The cord was pulling away from the wires inside it... you could even then see the metal wire inside that.. if that makes sense... I'm too lazy to paint a better picture. All in all, completely unusable for me. I'm going to have to invest in a radio with an aux input. That's just the only way to go.I'm assuming I just got one of the bad ones construction wise. And I'm sure the reception has to do with many factors. My antenna for one is not that great in the car. That's the only reason why I'm giving it two stars instead of one. It worked if I held the thing out the window next my antenna.. Otherwise it's crap (for me).."
5,THE AMAZING SONG EVER,"This Milk Inc's song, is the best ever, starting whit its simplicity and the amazing Linda's voice, passing through the beatifully well made music. Gotta to have it!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,No instructions,"I was a little dissapointed since it came with no instructions and the box it came into was very old and had holes in it. Other than that, it was fine."
3,Extreme 2 vs. Sport model?,"I've been trying to research these 2 machines to make a decision. I've tried both at the local sporting goods store, and found the Sport to work better for me. I'm wondering if I didn't have the Extreme adjusted correctly. I'm a woman, about 5'9"". Maybe I'm too small for the machine? I only tried the bench press, but it was way too easy on the Extreme. Much more realistic on the Sport. I'd like to hear from anyone (women especially) who have bought the Extreme or Extreme 2 model.Thanks!"
3,Great Machine for the avg. Joe BUT!,"I purchased this machine and loved it at first. It was a little hard to get used to the resistance as I was always an avid weight lifter. I wanted something that was quick and easy. This was the machine.Now, why I do not use it any longer. As I progressed I felt something was lacking with this machine. I determined it was the power rods. They just do not offer even resistance. What I mean by this is example, a rod is rated at 50 pounds resistance, BUT, that is only when you can get full tension on the rod. Many exercises are situated in a way in which it is not possible to fully contract the power rods. The smaller your body type the more pronounced this will become.If you are serious about getting and staying in shape I would bypass this machine and take a look at the new machines from Bowflex that no longer use the power rods."
4,Just not long enough,"I guess my main problem was the lack of length of this video. I I remember as a kid watching The mills bros. on variety shows in the 60's. I would have liked to have seen more of those clips. It's unfortunate,but the Harry Mills on the video most of the time was not the one I remember. All in all, being a Mills bros. fan I enjoyed it and could have used another hour."
5,EXCELLENT SOURCE FOR BACKGROUND INFORMATION.,"AS A MEMBER OF THE MILLS BROTHERS SOCIETY, THIS VIDEO IS A GOLD MINE OF CLIPS,INTERVIEWS, AND GENERAL INFORMATION PRECIOS TO ALLMILLS BROTHERS FANS. I LOVED IT."
4,25 Shotokan Kata,"As karate can not be learned from book because it is more practical and have to join the Karate club to learn properly. But this book is nice reference for doing your kata. Once you learn katas from your Master (sensei), it is good book for reviewing and refining your kata steps.We are practicing Sotokan Karate in Richmond, Kentucky. Our instructors use this book as good reference. I am glad that I bought this book and anybody serious about learning of Shotokan Karate, I recommend this book."
4,Easy to follow descriptions of basic Shotokan katas,"My wife and I have trained in both Shotokan and Shito-ryu styles. Sugiyama Sensei's book is easier to follow than the more popular ""Best Karate"" series by Nakayama Sensei. It also provides commentary on how to perform the Katas not only in English, but also Spanish and Japanese. We're ordering copies for our Spanish speaking comrades here in Guatemala."
4,Really nice book!,"The book shows step-by-step instructions on how to do the katas. If you've learned the katas before, you will love it. If you've never learned them before, you may find a little difficult to do the more advanced ones. A video will help you more in those cases because of the details that even well described are hard to do without watching someone doing it in front of you. I can't think of a better way to teach katas using a book, though and because of that, I think it's still worth buying the book and if you feel that you need, buy a video to help with the harder katas. Good luck!"
4,25 Shotokan Kata gives a unique approach to Kata.,"Most of the books that I have seen on teaching Kata become either a picture book of some Champion doing Kata or show some arcane applications to Kata. In this respect 25 Shotokan Kata is very refreshing.25 Shotokan Kata is the only book on the market that is solely concerned with the teaching of kata. While it doesn't make for exciting pictures (with cartoon-style Kiai's overlayed) it does focus on what students need to learn Kata. In fact since using this book I don't have to teach my students the moves to the kata anymore, rather, I can take more time looking at correction and application.For the Karate student that needs to learn the kata's this book is essential."
5,Best Kata Book Ever,"Truly, truly the greatest kata book ever!!! There are a lot of helpful bunkai illustrations also. Yes, its usually expensive and no, you won't find it for very cheap, ever. But, I have lots of kata books. Actually, a friggin library of kata books and this is so user friendly. The hidden hand is illustrated with dash lines so as to give the whole truth. So many people have their own interpretation of katas and this helps set the record straight with precision, conciseness, and direction. Many teachers will try to hold you back by determining your pace and this allows you to go at your own pace and blaze forward. Turn your learning curve to full blast. If theres a better kata book out there, tell me, but I haven't found it yet."
4,An excellent reference,"This book summarises all the standard Shotokan kata for most organisations, and makes an excellent reference if you are checking a particular move or sequence. The forms are JKA-style (I practice Kanazawa-ryu) but most instructors will be familiar with the small differences and the history and reasoning behind them. The use of drawings to illustrate the moves helps; the drawings are not the most elegant I have seen, but clearer than photographs. Good reference books on kata are not common; this is one worth adding to your collection."
5,25 Shoto-Kan Kata,"This is a must if you or your children are heading up the ranks in Shoto-Kan style karate. Each move of the kata (form) is shown in detail. So, if your child has left the dojo (karate studio) and wants to practice the kata but can't remember how it goes, this book will remind them. This book should cover all the forms that you will encounter through black belt. The price is a bit steep, but it is well bound and worth it."
4,Some great new sounds,"Just happened to bump into a couple of wonderful Dave Eshelman big band charts-""Mystique"" and ""I Will Take You There"", both of which my University Jazz Band performed this year. Much to my delight, I found out that Dave had recorded an album by the same name. Thinking that it would be the Jazz Garden big band, I ordered a copy, only to find out that it was a small group session. Somewhat let down, I dropped it in the player and WHAT A TREAT! An all-star rhythm section and great tunes. Not many guys have the right to take on J.J.'s ""Lament""---its just one of those tunes you leave alone for fear of spoiling such a gorgeous line-- but Dave and the group do it justice with due respect to the composer. PLEASE-email me if you know of other recordings and be sure to latch on to this one."
2,Not what I expected,The product description for this item is quite lacking. I bought this thinking I was receiving a 10x36 hair light including the light. This item is just the soft box assembly and you actually need to buy a separate part before you can even assemble it. There is nothing in the item description saying you need to purchase separate parts to get your final product as shown in the picture. I'll be contacting Adorama Camera and returning this item.
5,Reads like a novel,"This is an excellent history of code breaking during World War II. The majority of the book is from the British perspective. It is action packed. If you are looking for the math behind the code breaking, this is not the book.Some key points are:-Code breaking of enigma much sooner than I had known.-Steps that the Germans took to ""secure"" their code often backfired and made it easier to break.-We are all human. Human habits were key to breaking the codes.-The code breaking was a key weapon in WWII.This book whet my appetite. I hope the author writes more. Possible topics include:-German code breaking. Too many teasers in this book about the German code breakers.. I want more details.-US code breaking of Japan and Germany.-The hints of the French activity left me wanting to know more.Overall I enjoyed the book. I would recommend it to history buffs and math buffs (too few books where mathematics and mathematicians are the heros.)"
2,Poorly structured account.,"A tedious and poorly organised account of a fabulously interesting history. Other reviewers have writen accurately about this book's good qualities but none have told how gripping it could be for a few pages and how absolutely bloodless and irritating it could turn for the next 10, leaving this reader frustrated, wanting the author to finish his present narrative (sometimes of treason and spies) before going onto the next stage of his story. Then there are the many pages of how the enigma machines actually worked. Perhaps code-breakers could follow it, but it was (again to this reader) writing as clear as mud -- descriptive writing so incredibly turgid as to make one read it aloud and laugh."
4,"Great writing, but limited mainly to Navy Enigma","Mr Sebag-Montefiore is an excellent story teller. It is diffcult to put this book aside.In contrast to other books on Enigma the technical details of the breaking are given in Appendixes, which makes reading easier. This is a very good idea.My only qualm is that the story is mainly that of the navy Enigma. Little is devoted to the air force and army Enigma, which is a pity."
3,Enigma for cryptology lovers,"Briefly, this book is far too detailed for the lay reader and probably not detailed enough for the crypto enthusiasts. I ""almost"" enjoyed it, but without a math/logic/coding background it was a tough read."
1,NOT RECOMMENDED,"Stopped working after 1 use. Ended up buying the Olympus brand for the same price as this one, so why waste your money on a generic product when you can get the real product for the same price."
1,Broken product,"Hard to review this purchase since it arrived broken. Very disappointed by the manner in which it was packed withthe rest of my order. Seemed like an afterthought and was just thrown in the box. wasn't worth my time and effort togo through the trouble of returning it, however the pinon incense has a nice scent."
5,fireplace smell i've been looking for.,"Easy to use and gives the exact smell i've been looking, sniffing, for. Log cabin burner helps disperse the smoke better then just burning the sticks alone."
3,Hard to keep the fire going!,Cute item and works great as long as the log keeps burning but I expected there would be some type of structure to hold the incense log in such a way that would keep it burning. It tends to need frequent relighting as the log rests horizontally on the clay bottom.
5,We all love it!,"This little house and incense is wonderful. The scent is so inviting. It really does smell like the outdoors - like a campfire or wood burning. It's so inviting and warm. They are a little hard to start, but once it is started, they burn all the way through. I purchased additional incense (a variety pack) and I still think that the pinon scent is the most appealing. It's wonderful!"
5,Cute & fun,"A very cute incense burner. Works very well, just make sure you have a good start in the incense when ingiting."
1,Won't start - leaks oil,"I'm glad others have enjoyed some success with their Husqvarna 350. I unfortunately am not one of those. I'm in the camp with others who continue to have starting problems.So does the Husqvarna rep just down the street where my Husqvarna is now being looked over.Bottom line, I bought it new - used it once - after some starting problems. Put it in an enclosed garage for a winter with fuel stabilizer. Tried it fire it up this past weekend and nothing.Took it to the Husqvarna rep and they had the same starting problems. They replaced the plug, which was drenched in fuel and oil, and got it to start - but only with the tell-tale oil and fuel all over the bar.Sorry folks, but a new chainsaw shouldn't be such a problem - nor should so many individuals in such a wide-geographic range be experiencing the exact same problems without there being some manufacturing deficiency.This was my fist Husqvarna purchase. It is also going to be my last."
1,Husqvarna has poor product,"I bought this chain saw about two months ago. I started having problems starting the saw, so I went back thru the manual and tried every trick from new fuel to filters. No luck. When the saw does start it will burn rather than cut a small log.I tried contacting these people with e-mails and got no, I repeat NO, reply. Not even ""go away"". I will never purchase a Husqvarna product because they have no customer support. If you dare to buy their product you are on your own."
2,Husqvarna 350 with Hole in Oil Reserve,"My Husqvarna 350 has worked without any issues for 2 years, using only occasionaly. However, it started leaking a lot of chain bar oil. When I took apart to see the problem, I found that the screws that hold the handle that screw up through the bottom have rubbed a hole through the bar oil reserver. The other screw has nearly rubbed a hole through the bottom. This was purchased by me new and it has never been worked on, so I did not install the handle with too long of a screw. It came from the factory this way. I recommend that anyone with one of these saws, check the screw length of the bottom two screws that hold the handle on. The oil reserve is part of the engine case so it is not a simple repair."
4,Runs great after getting it started,"Bought this saw as a new discontinued model at a local Husqvarna dealer. At first I had trouble getting it started. followed the instructions on the saw and in manual but could not get it started after 1 hour. Got a little frustrated and aksed my neighbor if he could help. He closed the choke and squeezed the accelerator all the way and pulled the starter rope and it started in two pulls. After that I used it all day and the saw ran great. USed two tanks of gas and chain oil. My neighbor stated I flooded it and usually they only need 2 to 3 pumps on the air purge ball. Strange since Husqvarna states 5 on the saw. It ran great all day long and as long as I don't have any more problems getting it started I would give it 5 stars. Since I've only had it for 2 days it's probably to early to give an accurate review, but I was extermely pleased once it started. Cut oak trees all day long like butter! Otherwise I'd give it 5 stars."
5,My little dream machine,"To all my brothers who has ever had a chain saw in their hands this is the sweetiest running, fastest cutting, lightest does not make your arms and back hurt after a days work. This little Husqvarna 350 is rugged and well built & I""m sure glad to have one. After this major ice storm we had up here in north Arkansas it works hard every day. I""m 70 years old and have owned several saws in my passed, but this is the best. Thanks a Lot!"
4,music from heaven,"Peluson of Milk has most of the natural and evidential skills of Luis Alberto Spinetta: sensible songs, an unusual way to play and write songs, a lot of creative experiences.Peluson of Milk is a useful and quick way to get in the artistical world of it`s author, even when his artistic production is definitely longer and varied.It`s a novel CD, mainly because a new touch of soft sound and a new Spinetta`s tour looking for something inbetween, something different. Another CD`s has some virtual and punctual points in common with the work of another contemporary musician, as Fito Paez or Charly Garcia (look for them, you won`t regret), but happily I think this work is unique."
5,PURE POETRY!!,"the words in spanish have a beutiful sound, Spinetta will show you magic moments of poetry and amazing vocals and music.Buy the cd. Is the best sound from the stars and the sea."
1,Don't waste your money!,"At first they were fine, but over time they became nasty.These mats are great as non-stick surfaces, but almost impossibleto clean. A greasy residue remains even after being put throughthe dishwasher.NEVER put them in direct contact with food because they will makeyour food taste so funky that you will throw out whatever you bakedon them. At first you might think there was something wrong withyour recipe because it is a weird taste, but I can assure you thatit is the mat that is responsible and not the recipe."
4,it will get you certified,A pretty standard Network+ book. It will get your certified. The only down side with this book is that there are too many authors involved and the writing style changes from chapter to chapter.I am glad to see they have Ron Gilster and Trevor Kay helping out. If you have some networking knowledge this book is perfect for you.
3,Good content -- but too many typos!,"Though I have found much useful info in this book, and like the practice exams and additional tools on the CD, the many typos and errors (including incomplete sentences) make it difficult to read. I think whoever did the proofreading (if anyone?) must've been asleep.I was familiar with many of the elements and concepts beforehand, but I've had a hard time grasping newer or unfamiliar subjects due to the many mistakes.I will definitely be using other materials to study with."
2,"good for reference, not for exam prep","This book is laden with stuff useful for anyone dealing with networks on a support level. However using this book as a primary source is a bad bad idea. The spelling, grammar, and factual errors left me with a ""duh"" a few times. The chapters are out of sequence as far as any type of learning curve (more often than not other chapters are referenced to explain something that's being explained in the beginning chapters). It's very long winded too. I doubt anyone who has read this from cover to cover once can remember nitty gritty details when they hit the last page. The software test really bites too. The questions are WAY easier than what the real test covers. I'm sorry to say this book is out of the return policy timeframe for me. Get the ExamCram book instead."
2,This book helped very minimal!!,"I read this book, I took the practice exams cd that was included with the book. AND IT WAS TERRIBLE!!! The basic stuff was barely on the NETWORK+ exam. I think that Mike Meyer's Passport was even better than this bible book. I do not recommend this book at all. It just goes through some of the stuff but it is very redundant. I failed the first time I took the NETWORK+ because I changed a couple of answers at the end but then the next day I took it again, I passed with flying colors. I would recommend getting definitely the mike meyer's passport to network+ and another book besides this one as the main source."
3,"Very detailed, but not worth that much money.","I couldn't wait to get this one! It is very detailed. Teaches you step by step AND gives you the names of all colors used. The method to get to the end result is a bit tricky, the brushes he uses can get very expensive, and I think that there are other ways of getting the same result, without all the expensive brushes."
1,Not for My Cat!,"I am glad this worked for other felines, but for mine who eats every kind of fish there is, LOL including cream cheese and lox, she will not even go near her bowl with this spray on her food!So far, she has eaten in 2 days, so I have returned it, but every cat is different!The above rules say I must rate this product with stars which is not fair, so I gave it a 1 instead of zero so my review could go in. I am just trying to be honest with the public,as, I wished I would have read more reviews on this."

2,A Book Targeted towards Montauk Alumni,"If you are looking for a book focussed on capturing the best of the nature photography, you will be disappointed. Whether it's the quality of the photograph or the quality of printing, the photos in the book don't look all that great to be worthy of (For example) a coffee table book, or even a living room book case.However, if you previously lived in Montauk or the Hampton, have nostalgic memories and wants to relive it, walk through it through the pictures, you may like this book. it's sincere work for sure, that's why a two."
5,best facial steam on the market,"have used this amazing product for facial steams for many years now - hope I never need it for its true use but if I ever do, bet it's great for that too"
3,A voice of sanity in a crazy world,"Most of this book consists of Gardner's columns from CSICOP's magazine Skeptical Inquirer, though it's filled out with similar articles that found homes elsewhere. Overall, Gardner surveys the realm of mysticism and pseudoscience, lingering on paradigmatic exemplars like Uri Geller and Shirley Maclaine. It's moderately entertaining reading for a skeptic (as I am), but I am reminded of Joel Achenbach's comment about reading such things: there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of point since you always know what the answer is going to be before you start. Still, in a world filled with silliness and pseudoscience, it's nice to have some voices of sanity, and Gardner's is certainly one of them."
3,PARANORMAL BELIEFS EXPOSED,"Martin GardnerThe New Age:Notes of a Fringe Watcher(Buffalo, NY: Prometheus Books, 1988)A collection of articles, many of which first appearedin The Skeptical Inquirer. Probing, well-researched, and very critical.Some themes examined: channeling and Shirley MacLaine;magicians passing as psychics; UFOs; fringe science;fundamentalists and Biblical beliefs such as creationism;perpetual motion machines; spiritualists; & Scientology.Find other debunking books by searching the Internet for:""OCCULTISM AND SCIENCE"".James Leonard Park, skeptic."
1,Martin Gardner at his low point,"Martin Gardner has written many fine short articles, and combined them as books. I have enjoyed several of them, but this is Martin at his low point- Not an inspiring read..."
3,"Entertaining, Not Outstanding","Worth a read, but be forewarned: this book operates within the strict mold of Pride and Prejudice. Consequently, much of it seems forced and awkward--particularly towards the end. That said, it is entertaining and spiced with entertaining details about life for Jewish retirees in Florida. A good summer book."
2,Plagiarism in more than one way,"Am I the only person to notice that the characters' looks and personalities have been lifted from the popular TV show ""The Golden Girls""? Think about it - one gray-haired and proud of it, one timid and mousy and one blowsy and slight vulgar - Dorothy, Blanche and Rose to the tee. I am surprised the makers of the TV show haven't taken some action against the writer."
1,Jane Austen in Boca,"Very disappointed in this book, a classic case of judging a book by its cover. This was no subtle reworking of a Jane Austen plot line but a wholesale theft of complete conversations and scenarios which were lifted out of some of Austen's most beloved works and plunked down virtually verbatim, with only the names changed to protect the innocent. Somehow the characters in this book were unable to carry off the same scenes in which Austen's characters shone. In the incapable hands of the ""Boca"" characters, the Austen material was so contrived, and the inevitable comparison to the same passages in Austen's books was so distracting that I could hardly finish ""Boca"" - I certainly knew the end before I'd finished two chapters. Stick with the originals and avoid this one. It is not even a good beach read."
1,Re-read Pride and Prejudice,"This is the first review I have written on Amazon and I am a little sad that the first is a negative one. This book is a 250+ page ethnic joke. I found it to be incredibly offensive. The characters are all the worst possible stereotypes. I cringe to think that people are ""laughing out loud"" at these people. Furthermore, it is completelty devoid of Jane Austen's love for humanity. Read the classic again and again and appreciate the human condition as depicted by a master, not this ""dreck""(trash). As for the complaint that some of the reviewers had regarding the use of yiddishism, some of the yiddish words were used so incorrectly that they made no sense at all."
4,Fun book,"I really enjoyed this book. I am an avid Jane Austen fan and Pride and Prejudice is my favorite, so I knew this book was going to be for me. The only reason I gave it four instead of five is a scene at the end of the book that I felt was forced, I guess to make it even more like Jane Austen's classic, however, I felt the writer did better when she was a little more quiet about it. However, don't let that deter you, overall, great book."
4,"Liked it, really wanted to love it","A nice, friendly, cozy reworking of my beloved ""Pride and Prejudice"". I really wanted to love this book, and I almost did. This is a fun book, until the end. The end just feels so rushed, it's almost like the author just gave up. Another couple of chapters maybe and I would have loved it. Still, a good book - lots of fun, and worth the read."
4,Jesus Soto,los challengers un grupo romantico por sus cansiones tan bonitas son un grupo muy bueno que siempre lo escucho para estar consiente de la musica romantica
1,Livin' in the Past,"Davis isn't bad with the earlier section of the book (dealing with singers he personally couldn't have heard live). When dealing with the recent past/contemporary singers, he tends to be unfair in his judgements. He seems to care more for singers of yore than any of his contemporaries. You come away wondering why he bothered to write a book about this subject."
4,"Complex, but engaging","You need to start with a clear head the first time you try to play this game. It is pretty complex, and there is a lot going on. Very, very clever, however, it is like playing a puzzle, a card game, and keeping a secret all at the same time."
4,Lots of fun!,"... and very silly. There are three ways to win the game (collecting the artifacts of your secret mission, adjusting the timeline to that of your own parallel universe, or gaining enough cards in your hard - usually by patching time paradoxes) which helps keep the game from getting repetitive or boring. The game does require quite a bit of table space to spread out the cards of the timeline, so it should be considered as much a board game as a card game. There does seem to be a preponderance of depressing events; it might have been nice to throw in some less depressing ones (or even seemingly insignificant ones to show how chaos theory and the ""butterfly effect"" might work.) Overall, quite an imaginative and fun game."
2,NIce Plastic phone,"Dont buy it, its plastic, its all a trick, false advertising, thats why its cheap. dont buy it, its not metal like it says."
2,"beautiful, but disappointing...","okay, just got my razr.beautiful design, really.easy to use, easy to dL & uL ringtones, pictures.logical os, mostly.but...the earpiece volume sucks! lower than my previous motorola (a t721...i think).useless on a busy manhattan street...really disappointed in this; what good is a mobile phone if u can't use it outdoors??may get it hacked, to increase the volume. but this shouldn't have to be this way..."
3,"Phone is cool, but contacts and volume/vibrate needs work","Overall I agree with the ""cool"" features of most of the reviewers. My problems are:1. The phone book lists every entry seperately (example if I put my husbands work and mobile in my phone, the address book lists 2 entries, Husband and Husband 1) This can be fixed by setting one number as primary and setting book to only show primaries, but then if you want to see other numbers you have to go back thru the settings and set to view all numbers, then set it back again after you view the number you want. This is a very annoying feature for me.2. The ringer volume is terrible. I have tried different ringtones, but still don't hear it if it is in my purse, or if I'm in the grocery store with it in my pocket or in my car. Never had that problem with my Nokia.3. The vibrate feature is so light, even when the phone is in your jeans pocket you can barely feel a flutter. My Nokia you could feel the vibrate and sometimes even hear the vibrations."
2,A BIG WASTE OF MONEY,"I'VE HAD THIS PHONE SINCE CHRISTMAS AND I HAVE HAD TO GET A NEW BATTERY TWICE! I HARDLY EVER TALK ON IT, AND IF I DO, IT'S FOR LESS THAN A MINUTE.MY PHONE WILL SHOW ONE BAR EVEN AFTER A WHOLE NIGHT OF CHARGING. AND IT TURNS OFF WHENEVER IT FEELS LIKE IT.I AM SO FED UP WITH THIS THING.PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY!!"
2,Reception issue,"I have been using Cingular and have had no issues with reception with my Nokia 3550. However, with this phone which I've had for less than a month, I notice there is a high pitch ""whirling"" static sound whenever I talk to someone either local or long distance. I don't believe it's Cingular's coverage, but something with the phone. I've read online reviews and other people who have bought this phone have had other issues with it as well. All I can say is do some further research before you buy it, looks are great but reception is more important."
2,I hate this phone!!!,It might look cool but it has really bad reception!!! It buzzes in my ear when I talk to someone!!!
2,way too outdated but can't complain too much for being paid for using it,"If somebody thinks this phone to be top of the line in 2005, I wont be surprised, but if it's said in year of 2007, I can't help but laughing. Man, there are ton's of better phones out there now. This phone is just a basic phone if it's not looked as outdated.Who would like to use a phone with a technology 2 years ago, anti-intuitive menu, awkward address book and no extendable slot?Well, at first I would like a phone to be a phone, a mp3 player, a gps and a pda...That would be a pda phone like Cingular 8525 or Treo 700. But I have to pay $150 for that comparing to what I am paid $125 here, that is a difference of $275 with which I can buy a mp3 player or a gps that can do a better job than a pda phone. Therefore I decide to let the phone be a phone.Somebody said that there is a headset in his box, none in mine.What's in the Box""RAZR V3 handset, lithium-ion battery, travel charger, user's manual. """
5,"Overall, great phone, couple mirror things ...","Great phone, lives up to the hype. My own issues so far :- Address Book Names - no sort-by-last-name.I sync my address book via Bluetooth and iSync (MaxOS X). Motorola only supports a single name field ... so you cannot sort your address by ""Last, First"" I'd looking for a work around/hack.- Volume is a bit low on the headset, unfortunally I think this is a new trend in audio devices due to hearing loss lawsuits."
2,"Good quality, bad feature set, crippled usb","Pros:Quality is really good. Huge screen, really solid, light, flat. Antenna is further from the ear/brain(?).Cons:Hardware:- buttons are too flat (cannot dial without looking), joystick is useless- absence of lights outside (to signal a missed call or voicemail)- absence of a standard headphone socketFirmware, software:- crippled usb (requirement to use drivers when just charging, so must use proprietary charger)- lenght limit on phone numbers- inability to work with calling cards- you cannot assign speed-dial to functions (only to address book entries)- absence of ""both ring and vibrate"" modeIt seems that some parts were designed by entirelly different teams."
5,Good Times.,"Okay, it does look cool. And yes, you will be the envy of any person with eyes. I have not had any problems with my phone. Don't listen to those nay-sayers who will tell you it sucks. Yes, there is a buzzing sometimes when you make a call, but that is not the phone. Any experienced cell phone user knows that is the result of poor reception, your carrier's fault. It's not a big deal at all, make sure you have a bar or two and make a phone call. My only complaint is that the speaker can be a bit quiet when you are making calls. But its not a big deal, that means you can't be playing Metallica at 50 decibels and talking on the phone at the same time. Seriously, the battery life is great, I have Cingular and the service is good, this phone owns, or pwns, all other phones. Get it. Love it. Make everyone else want it."
4,Happy I ignored the 1-star reviews,"I almost let all the negative reviews dissuade me from even trying this phone, when I needed to upgrade from my Nokia 6310i (it had terrible reception, and I assumed it was Cingular's network).I upgraded to the Razr, and have 5/5 bars in the same areas the Nokia had 1or2 out of 7! (far north side of Austin, TX)Navigating the menu is extremely intuitive, even after years of using Nokia (I can only guess reviewers who complain about Motorola's menus have received a sharp blow to the head; it's almost the same).My only two complaints have been noted by others:--display is unusually dim outdoors,--the 640x480 camera sucks.But I wouldn't let those stop me from trying the Razr. (NOTE: epinions.com has only one negative review of the Razr)"
1,Worst Cellphone I ever had,"I bought this phone in september 2005. It looks really nice and flat but:1-Phonebook is prehistoric you can't store more than one number under the same name unless you enter the name again.2-The charger seems to have some connection error after 2 months, I have to move the plug up and down till this ""sensitive pieace of ..."" gets electricityI had NOKIA and SONY ERICSSON before and used them for at least 2 years with no problem.Motorola after 3 months started giving me trouble..WIll never buy and recommend this product."
3,Good phone however,"Love the size. Can't beat the price. Reception certainly much better than my Nextel phone. Interface isn't exactly what I'd call great. You have to press a lot of buttons to check email for example. Address book doesn't stack a persons phone numbers under their name. You'll have one line item for each number (i.e. cell, home, work etc). My biggest complaint is it is not loud enough. Even with volume at max you will struggle to hear people while driving in traffic or at an airport."
1,Amazon Shipping,"I ordered this phone on June 23, 2006, 2 day delivery, which I desperately needed.On the 25th, I get ean e-mail that there is a delay with the order.On the 27th, I get an e-mail telling me that Cingular has approved the order.On July 3, TWELVE DAYS AFTER I PLACED AN ORDER WITH 2-DAY SHIPMENT, I get an e-mail requiring me to confirm my order before they can ship. I do so. Tomorrow is July 4. So I will end up getting a 2-day shipment over 2 weeks after I placed it."
2,Good fashion but function is horrible,"The look of this phone is great, but reception, the menu, and contact list are terrible. I can not recommend this phone unless it is a secondary phone that you need to be super slim. Motorola also makes you pay $30 for their sync software which is horrible as well."
2,"Attracted to the phone because of it's size and slim-ness, but very dissapointed","I bought this phone from Cingular, and while I haven't had any major problems with the carrier, the phone is too fragile for everyday use. I've taken good care of this phone and keep it in a leather case, but it's already acting up. The phone randomly shuts off, especially during calls, even though the battery is charged. It seems as if the battery is secure in it's compartment, so I can't figure out what is wrong with it, beside the fact it's just a poorly designed phone. If size is what you're looking for in a phone, I'd look elsewhere."
1,Cingular is a Weasal Company,"The phone is okay, but the Verizon phone (V3c) has 10x the memory and better reception. Cingular is spotty, even in the middle of urban areas. Also, the company policies are some of the worst in the business. I would seriously consider Verizon, Sprint, or T-mobile first."
3,OK..... maybe too thin?,its cool. don't care for the thickness. the sounds are lame. nice black finish. the camera BLOWS. the sound is OK. JUST OK.
3,Chep phone,"I don't know why motorola insists on not changing its standard interface on their phone's, the only remarkable caracteristic of this phone was its stylish look, after that it jsut another chep Motorola phone."
1,Very disappointed,"I bought this phone thinking I was moving forward, but- It's clumsy to navigate. Even simple tasks take several actions.- Impossible to 'touch-dial'. There's no 'feel' to the keys.- It has a most annoying phone book memory, which I understand is common with all Motorola phones. It stores only one phone number per entry. So if ""Ron"" has a home phone, work phone, cell phone, etc. I need three or four ""Rons"" in my directory.- I can't get to ""Ron"" by typing R_O - have to type ""R"" and then scroll down through all the ""R's"" until I get to Ron.Other Problems include:-Low earpiece volume-Very weak vibrate-Poor camera quality.-The ""Flip"" is a bit clumsy to do with one hand.Yes, it's cool looking, slim and light to carry.Now if only it was convenient to make a phone call.I miss my old Nokia."
1,"terrible operating system, poor phone overall",this phone gets one star for the appearance. the sound quality on the earpiece is terrible and i don't think i've ever run into an operating system and menus that were less intuitive. don't be fooled by it's chic appeal.
4,Amazon's number portability,Amazon number portability sucks. I bought the new Razr phone and now can not transfer my number because amazon sucks. They have no agreement with Cingular. If I had know this I would have kept Sprint.They want to charge me $250 for an $179 retail phone.
2,"Nice and Slim, But not worth the money",This phone is way overrated. I like the size but that is about all I like about it. The speaker volume is way too low. It can hardly be heard when driving down the road without pressing it into your ear very hard. Just not what I expected. Buy something else.
1,rebate,It appears you do not want me to post my horrible experience with the rebate. I just want to caution other that you have a problem with itl Beware
5,motorola v3 black version,i just got this phone in hong kong..i waited for the price reduction..kick ass phone!!!!
5,AT&T Former Customer need to save current cell number.,"I want to obtain this deal to get the RAZR for free. Unfortunately, I'm still with AT&T; billing plan and I want to be able to have my current cell number to be on the Cingular RAZR cell phone. I have no way to contact customer service on Amazon for phone service.How am I be able to use my current cell number for RAZR cellphone? There is no way on the Amazon to do that.."
2,Don't Judge A Cell Phone By It's Look,At first this cell phone looks really great. It is skinny and small and looks cool. DONT BE FOOLED!!! This phone is horrible! The external screen is very bad as it does not fill up the whole space they gave it on the screen. The camera is horrible. The screen gets smudges in a day. HORIBBLE PHONE!!! Get something better like the V551 or the S710a!
4,"Great phone, good service, don't believe the negative hype","First off, the phone rocks. It is thin, cool, and very usable. The only problems are with the earpiece volume being a little low, no flash on the digital camera, and the issues with multiple numbers under one name. Cingular's service is usually savaged in Chicago, but I found it is better in the dead areas than verizon, t mobile or sprint (and no worse anywhere else). It's not very good in basements, but everywhere else it works well. By the way, the price is great (free after rebates) and I am very happy with the customer service. It would be a 5 star transaction if the aforementioned problems would be addressed."
5,RAZR Rules,The motorola Razr is Extremely functional and is one of the best phone on the market. It gets excellant Reception and it is stylish. It is small and it has an excellant Screen. The camera is excellant quality and the battery life is long lasting. With the drop in price it is definately worth the buy.
1,beware,"If you drop this phone from even the slightest distance off the ground, it will BREAK. I dropped mine from a desk chair to the floor (approx. 2 feet), it hardly bumped the ground, and the phone is kaput. Unless you are the most unusually careful person in the world, do not buy this phone. It is not worth the hassle of replacement."
2,Sleek Design But Low Quality Components,I just got this phone from Cingular a few days ago and with all the hype I was hoping for something better. Sure the phone has a sleek thin design but the camera is only .3mp ( compared to 1.3 from competing cellular companies) and the internet for the non VCAST phone is completely unacceptable. I tried the mobile Television made for Cingular and I got a video of around 3 frames per second. There is also no MP3 player in this phone so it really isn't worth the hype. I suggest getting a ROCKR cellphone or a pocket PC cellphone both of which cost nothing with 2yr activation and can handle much faster internet and all the major features the RAZR lacks.
1,Too many quality issues!,Drops calls too frequently and my wife and I both had to return ours (within 9 months of purchase) for warranty exchange for having stuck buttons on the keypad.
2,Cant damn screen!!,Ive owned this phone for a while and finally convinced someone else to sell me their phone. You cant see the screen in the daytime. I really have to like cup my hand over the screen when the suns out and even then its hard to tell what your doing. And the navigation through the menus and the rest of the phone sucks. I promise you... Get this phone and be sorry.
1,Utterly awful,"There's only one good thing about this phone: it is well-shaped. It fits in your pocket nicely. Otherwise, my god is this awful. It's as if the marketing department designed the software: the UI is appalling and confusing, common things take several clicks, and it's loaded with useless features like Cingular Mail and mediaNet. I'm not sure what genius thought that ""Tools"" like the Calculator belong in the ""Settings"" menu, but there it is. The user interface is also just plain ugly, not even close to the stylishness of the phone itself.You should be getting this phone for free these days, though I'm not sure zero dollars is really even a good price for it."
1,Terrible,"Overall the RAZR is a huge dissapointment. The OS seems to have been designed by a chimp (one of the more stupid ones) and the 'cool' appearance just gets annoying after a short time. The buttons can't be dialed by just feeling for them, which makes them look cool, but really hurts functionality. Any amount of moisture will cause it to stop working, and it ALWAYS has at least 1 bar less service than my friends' phones with Cingular. The commercials are the most misleading. While the phone is relatively thin, it's actually quite large in its other dimensions. Also, there is an annoying humming sound along with a VERY soft ear volume making it very difficult to hear some people. Mixing that with the fact that just about everyone on earth has this phone now a days, what seemed like a sleek alternative has turned out to be just a big pain."
2,HUH?,"I bought this phone from a Cingular Store. The phone is slim and sleek and the camera phone is pretty good I must say but there are some things that drive me crazy, so much so I am returning the phone.1) I'm 23 and can barely hear sometimes on it.2) If you're anywhere with a lot of light, the phone's backlight doesn't illuminate bright enough to be able to see ANYTHING on the screen. My friends Motorolla phone does not have that problem.3) I was walking in a VERY light sprinkle and it damaged the phone. Granted, water damages phones, but I've been in strong rainstorms with past phones with no problem.4) The screen and keyes are shiney and get dirty VERY easily. I spend most of my time cleaning it.5) Scrolling through things takes forever as the phone will be behind every click you make.Just a few thoughts I wish I had. By the way, don't waste your time in the mall or cingular stores buying equipment. The deal is online, not in the store. I learned the hard way."
2,Beauty and no brain,"This phone, and all the other versions of V3, stores the same contacts multiple times. i.e. same name with cell, home, work and email address would be stored as 4 different entries. So now if you have 100 contacts stored on your phone with four different numbers(cell,home,work,email etc), there will be 400 entries stored in your phone. and if you have to browse through then there are 400 entires to go through. Very very annoying feature.Did Motorola ever tested this phone before releasing. I guess not. What a waste of money. I am giving it 2 stars only because I am able to make phone calls with it!"
2,Not a good phone,We got in one month back. The voice is not clear. Always I had to use speaker to talk to others. Returned this phone and got the basic Motorola V188.
3,"Good Phone, Bad Headaches","This phone is definately cool but beware. Unless you use it on speakerphone all the time like I do now, you'll get pretty bad headaches. Dunno why."
4,For truck drivers Cingular,provides the best national coverage at the best price. I just got the razr and am still learning to use it but it beats the heck out of my Nokia 3596. The worst problem I have with it is the screen get greasy when I put against my ear.
2,"Overhyped status-symbol jack-of-all-trades, master of none","The Good: Size, battery life, charge time, customization ability, big lcd screenThe Bad: Incredibly poor industrial design...the buttons on the side are easily pressed, and they will do things like change your ringer style, volume, etc without you knowing it. The buttons are absolutely stupid...designed for the hands of a japanese nymph with dwarfism. Even if you set up hot keys, you'll have to look at the godamned thing first....NOT a safe phone while on the road. It also likes to drop calls and do weird things, such as power off during calls, even when it's in use. The camera is practically useless....especially any video, oh look, some animated blobs.I really hate this piece of garbage. It's all style with very little substance. Avoid this trendy junk."
1,Razr doesn't cut it,"The slim and attractive appearance is undisputed but the ease of use (menus) and reliability needed more attention. They promptly replaced it, both times it didn't work, including a battery that wouldn't hold a charge after only 10 months of use however the replacement battery won't hold a charge near as long as the previous 6 to 8 phones I've had. I might have understood if it were a cheap phone, but with a hefty price tag (I'm embarrassed to say how much I paid for it), I expected the best and got much less."
2,What rebate?,The phone is OK and Cingular seems fine but I cannot believe how difficult it's been trying to receive the rebate. Thanks Amazon for wasting my time. Ridiculous!!
2,This phone stinks.....Literally!,"After a few months I noticed a really BAD smell coming from the dialpad of the phone. I tried cleaning it with everything and nothing worked. I had no idea how the phone picked up the smell.....I was worried that for some inexplicable reason it was coming from.....moi? (I smoke) But much to my amazement a friend of mine was experiencing the same problem to the point that she ended up buying another phone. I then decided to google ""Motorola Razr Bad Smell"" and sure enough, there were a NUMBER of hits from people reporting the same thing....If you want to buy this phone...very cute, very sexy, very slim....make sure you carry a bottle of perfume with you because the smell becomes very, very annoying.Would I buy another one??? Nope"
1,Worst cell phone I've ever had..won't buy another one.,"I could go on and on but I'll keep it short. I've been a cell phone user since bag phones and I've had many, many, portables. The Razr is the worst. The only thing I can say good about it is its size, I can carry it in my pocket. The worst about is the inability to see the keypad in bright sunlight. it looks nice but it's not practical and forgot seeing the letters for text messaging. They need to make this phone with a matte finish keypad so it's more visible. It doesn't drop calls, at least with Cingular BUT the Razr earpiece is lousy, I have to keep moving it over my ear to hit an audible spot and usually end up just using bluetooth so I can hear. Buttons on the side of the phone are easy to punch by accident. I WON'T be buying another Razr until they improve it."
1,Screwed on the rebate,I like the phone but I'm still waiting for my rebate after a year. Can't seem to get through the system..... I bought two and I'm out $300 bucks.... next time I buy from someone other than Amazon....
3,white noise anyone?,"I'm not sure if this is a problem specific to my service area, but my razr phone interferes with many electronics--like my car stereo, television, etc. If I'm watching tv, i can tell when I'm about to get a call BEFORE the phone begins to ring because the tv gets this weird static...same goes for the car stereo. anyone else experience this? Also, when I flip the phone open (and no one is on the other line) you hear this high-pitched sound...happens when I'm on the phone as well and sounds almost like a teapot whistling in the background."
2,Razr is great - drop Cingular,"10 years into the cell phone revolution the phones have gotten smaller, lighter with great features but what's the point when you can't carry on a conversation? I have found Cingular to be by far the worst in terms of dropped calls in the SF Bay Area. I suffered thru AT&T and their conversion to GSM and Cingular is not any better than that service no matter what they promise. Cingular also has very consumer unfriendly 2 yr. contracts that you will be paying on long after that shiny phone has lost its lustre. They are constantly changing their rollover minute plans to screw you out of your minutes. When i downgraded from a higher national plan to a lower national plan they took away all the minutes I aquired in a year. In other words maximize the revenue - minimize the service is their motto. I could live with this if i could make a decent phone call - i can't believe there are so many dead areas in a place with 13 million people."
3,Not all that,This phone is very slim am dissatisfied with the speaker volume. try out before you buy.
3,Great phone with one major flaw,"I have enjoyed everything about this phone, except for one major flaw, which some other reviewers have also mentioned. The earpiece volume is extremely low. If I am anywhere with any noise at all (in the car, outdoor event with noise, etc.), I cannot hear what the other person is saying to me. It is so bad, that I am going to have to return this phone. I was hoping that I just had a faulty unit, but some of the reviewerss mentioned that they have gotten their's replaced, and they are all the same. I don't use an earpiece, so if you primarily do us one, this may not be a big issue for you.It is a wonderful phone, otherwise. But, this is too major of a fault, to keep the phone."
1,"As a phone, the Razr is awful. Stay away from this phone.","I purchased a black Razr from Best Buy with a Cingular service plan. Without question, it was the worst handset I've ever owned. The unit's recepotion constantly broke up in my apartment (I get full strength on my three year old Sanyo with Sprint), and it's really hard to hear on the unit (the volume is awful). The one bright spot for me was the speaker phone, but that wasn't enough to keep it. I cancelled my Cingular plan and gave the phone back to Best Buy. I really liked the style of this phone, but unless you plan to carry a second phone for your calls, I cannot recommend this unit."
5,Motorola RAZR Blk Phone,"This is the best phone in the world! I love it so much! I'm telling you to get this phone.Everytime you look at it you get chills up your spine.Just look at it. You know you want it.If you think the price is too much just go to Sam's Club and get it for only $98.87,Yes that's the price. So go and get a black razr phone and it will change your life FOREVER!!!"
2,Wait for the next version toarrive.,"When are people going to learn not to buy a first model?? Far too many people are reporting identical problems with this phone!! As with anything, cars,computers HDTV, etc. This first model is fot the stupid, willing to act like a guinea pig, to see what to fix for the future. While this phone came out with a bunch of bells and whistles, what you really want from a good cell phone is quality reception, ease of use, and value fot the dollar spent. This phone needs to go back to the drawing boards, and fix its problems before the next model is unveiled. Save your money, and wait until they fix the techncal problems."
1,Poor Quality Phone,I bought this phone and had nothing but trouble with it from day one. The feature that did not work was the clock. There is no way to set the clock on this phone and the clock was always either off by two hours or the clock didn't work at all. I have returned this cell phone twice and decided to go with a different brand.
2,problematic,"I used to work for an authorized cell phone dealer. the v3 and motorola in general were the most troublesome. Motorola seems to be in the business of high mark ups and cheap quality (clever marketing tool). They are very sleek and trendy phones, but they just don't last.I have never seen so many people come back with the same problems on these phones. There is a lot of high tech stuff, but its simply too much for such a thin phone. In my experience, too much technology causes headaches especially with cell phones. For Motorola and the V3 in particular, everything from the screens (especially the screens), to the features, to the multimedia are potential for problems. you are asking for it, if you choose motorola.Phones like this are given out for free for two reasons, they are cheaply made, and they are bait to get you to sign a new two year contract (this is where the money is). Do not let some salesman try to sell you on a phone so willing to break on you."
2,Too many problems,"I purchased this phone because I really liked the design of the product and was happy with Motorola products in the past. However, for the past 5 years, I have had only Samsung phones. I'm sorry to say that the Razr is all design and very poor quality. My phone constantly loses its ringtone setting. Additionally, I often answer the phone only to realize that although I can hear the person on the other side, they cannot hear me.There are phones out there that are a better compromise between style and performance - i'm going back to Samsung."
2,2 Razrs down; 3 I'm out,"I purchased my first Razr in September 2005. December 2005 a black screen with a lot of numbers and codes appeared. I could not use the phone at all. Two or three weeks later Motorola sent the repaired phone back. Last week, June 2006, my ""new"" phone started with the black screen, numbers and codes. I contacted Motorola and Cingular about the problem. I received another phone in 2 days (I paid for the speedy delivery).The bottom line is even though the phone is less than a year old, if I have problems with the new phone, I will get a replacement phone that has been refurbished. The Cingular service rep said that I could not get another phone at this time. They know that the phone is a lemon. I absolutely hate Cingular service and policies. I wish they had some serious competition down here. The other companies are a joke in this area. They are worse than Cingular. I like the size and weight of the Razr, but it would be a bonus if it actually worked."
4,So for so good,"Just recently I bought this phone. I received it 2 weeks from the date I order. Amazon did not ship until 9 days, though it says ""usually ships in 24 hrs"" . But it did not bother me though.The phone looks sleek and sexy. Everyone around me think it is coolest phone ever. I am getting compliments from all over.I did not have any problems, just opened the box, charged the phone, put in the SIM and with in a minute started talking.The phone menu is little confusing, but once you get used to it , you should be fine.I hate this menu within the menu options. Sometimes i dont notice these smmall menu icon display which indicates that there is one more level of menu to the existing item.. Grrr....As for as car charger and USB cable is concerned, dont waste your money. I bought a belkin car charger(47.99) and belkin mini B USB cable ($4.65) from walmart. Search for it in the Audio section of walmart.Will write again"
1,Phone Not Yet Shipped,"Beware of Amazon's ""Ships in 24 Hours"" message. I ordered this phone on December 13, and it still has not shipped since today, December 22. I have been told that because of choosing free shipping, it takes longer to ship out. It should take longer to deliver, not longer to ship, and I have ordered other items with free shipping and this hasn't happened."
1,the worst phone ever bought,"ok, i got the phone just a couple weeks ago and was using it allday for photos.when i came home that night i set my phone at the top of my desk (3 foot drop) and my cat kicked it off jumping up to my desk it fell to the floor and hit a book and the front screen poped out. that made me really mad. the next day when someone called my i opend my phone talked him and closed it and the hole bottom part bent in like it was cardboard. my friends front screen poped out to. DONT BUY!!!!!!"
2,V3 Razr power,"Battery life is very very poor. does not hold even one day ! are there different kind of batteries with the original supply pack,if so surprised ."
1,Roaming charges,"I am thinking about getting this phone with Cingular. I like the thiness and look of the phone. I read the fine print and noticed that they have a 79 cent/min charge for roaming on all of the plans offered through Amazon. I'm with T-Mobil now and don't have to pay for any US roaming. Under Cingular, if I roam more than a couple of hours a year, I might as well have paid $200 for the phone. Can anyone who has purchased this phone through Amazon with Cingular service tell me if the roaming charges are accurate?"
1,Motorola razr phone,"I was really excited when I first purchased the phone, it looks great. However within 1 month I started having issues. It drops a lot of calls. The keys started messing up and getting locked. If you charge it for too long it will shut down. If you do not charge it long enough it breaks down and leaves a message that states ""unable to charge"". This phone turned out to be a joke that was on me. I returned it because they couldn't fix it and the second one that they sent me was worse than the first. The man at the cingular store stated that a least 2-3 people a week return the phone for similiar problems. Take my advise do not buy this phone!!!!!"
4,Public Service Announcement - Differences between Black and Silver RAZR,"In case you were wondering, the ONLY differences between the black and silver RAZRs are:1. The Color2. The Price Tag (at some stores)There are NO new features in the black RAZR. It has all the same specs (and bugs) as the silver model.In choosing a RAZR you should consider which color you like best, and whether or not you're willing to pay the price premium some stores are charging on the black one.You should also read the reviews for the silver model, since both phones are the same inside.A couple of other notes:-The keyboard on the black RAZR is silver. Some people do not like this.-The RAZR (probably the silver one only) is rumored to be coming to another US carrier very soon (Hint: starts with ""T"", ends with ""obile"")-There will be a lot of new sharp looking phones with features superior to the RAZR coming out this fall."
4,DOES WHAT A PHONE IS SUPPOSED TO DO,"Geez, all this angst about what the razr does and doesn't do. I've owned several phones and this one excels in most of the ""real world"" applications, such as: 1. I hardly ever get a dropped call, 2. It is thin enough to rest in my front pants pocket without feeling like I've got a hummer in there. 3. The body is tough and seems like it will last a good long time. 4. no antenna sticking out, need I say more? 5. I can see the screen-all the time. 6. menu is easy to navigate. 7. The camera works great in a pinch. If I wanted to take ""real"" pictures, I would have a ""real"" camera with me. So, all in all, it does what it should without any major annoyances. Could they improve it? Yep, and they will, but for now, I'm happy to have a small, light, easy to use phone that does most things pretty well."
2,Not good -- poor volume and reception,"If you need to hear your calls or want decent reception (at least in Downtown NYC), I would pass on this phone. Sure it looks swell, but even at the highest volume position, callers are barely audible above common street noises. I can't fathom why Motorola hasn't fixed this serious design flaw.I've also found that reception on this phone is much worse than on my older, less fancy Motorola. Callers immediately noticed the poor reception when I ""upgraded"" phones, even though I didn't preface the conversation by telling them I was using a new phone.Appearance matters, but not when the basics aren't met."
2,Trouble with Battery?,"Just got the RAZR 3- phone is great. However, am having a lot of trouble with battery life- it is dying very quickly. Manual says needs a few full charge/discharge cycles. I think i'm up to 4x. Anybody else with this problem?"
4,Worth the cost,"its sleek, smart, and a good fone. Camera is below average but then i bought this fone to use it as a fone, so it doesn't matter.This fone is worth its cost."
1,Worst phone and service ever!,"This phone sucks bigtime. First of all the usage is complicated. Its not user friendly. It shows a very good signal on the phone but the voice breaks up most of the time. Sometimes it disconnects just like that even if the reception is full!!. On the bottom right corner of the main screen you have AIM (AOL Instant messenger), I dont use AIM and i dont need it there. It doesnt make any sense, not everybody who buys this phone use AIM. It should have been more like a Address Book or something. If you want to store more than 1 phone number for the same person(e.g. home, mobile) it shows up as 1 entry for each in the address book making the phone list complicated. Dont buy this phone or you will have to repent."
1,cingular no honor,the phone is only ok-gets smuggy easily. Cingular charged twice the price on my first months bill and said that because I brought it from a third party that there was nothing they could do. The activation fee is 36.00 not 18.00 as listed. And they start charging you time from when you order and not from when you get the phone. They say it is so you can start to use your phone time minutes(before you get the phone?) Cingular is on the bottom of customer service in Consumer Reports and now I know why.
5,Black Razr is the BOMB!!!,"Just picked it up but already love it. Simple to use, fits in my pocket, large display screen + reception is GREAT. I had a Motorola V22 and traded up for a small fee. Well worth it, BUY THIS PHONE!!!!!"
2,Problems with Motorola Razr Black,"If you read some of the reviews in this forum with *5 ratings then those all things are true. But I found few problems with this phone. I bought this phone 2 weeks back from Amazon.com with 2yr contract.I am getting very less volume when I am speaking to others over the phone. As I am hearing less volume, I am speaking on a high pitch. This is really irritating me. I donno did someone noticed this problem or not...When I open the phone and keep on my ears then I am hearing some continous distortion. To verify this problem, I went to shopping mall and I took the cingular wireless sales representatives phone and I heard more noise then on my phone. Strange part is.... I can hear this only on certain angle.... position of the phone on my ears.Please help me if this is the common problem with this phone."
1,"1 word, 1 Star: Horrible","One of my friends owns this phone and I tried using it. I think it's an overall horrid design. The phone itself only has a few settings and is the most ugliest thing I've ever seen. It's hard to navigate and even worse to use.Just because it's `thin' is no reason to get it, because instead of being `chunky' like other phones it's a lot wider to make up for the `thinness'.Don't go near this phone. You'll thank me for it in the end."
1,Damaged Product,When I opened the Bob Mills box 3 out of the 4 bags of flour were open. I was very upset by this and it set back my bakery orders by 5 days. I will never again purchase Bob Mills products from this site.
3,Bean Flours are tooooo strong!,"I like Bob's flours, and I've recently gone gluten-free. I bought this mix on recommendation and I really don't like it. The fava and garbanzo bean flavor is way too strong for my taste. Perhaps I just need to have patience while my palette adjusts. But I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who is just starting off gluten free. I'd rather recommend something that has flours that mimic the flavors of wheat like sorghum, buckwheat, tapioca, and almond, etc."
3,"Avoid in baked goods, pretty good in pastas.","So I have a love/like/hate relationship with ""Bob"" I love his other milled gluten flour flours, I tolerate the pancake mix, I hate his biscuit mix. I've tried this flour mix with bread, biscuits and pancake and haven't like it at all, the only thing I do like it in is homemade gnocchi or pumpkin pasta pillows. It imparts a strange smell from the bean flour that overwhelms your ability to discern the flavor."
2,A 2 because it worked as a dusting but not as a substitute for non-gf flour in recipes.,"New to the GF world as of 12/10. Already tired of the bad taste and smell from GF flours. Bob's Red Mill products are so easy to find that of course it was the first one I purchased and tried. Using a mixture of this flour with some salt and pepper for dusting chicken turned out really well. Next I tried using it in muffins and biscuits as I would have my old non-gluten free flours. Horrible. I have been doing a lot of research into this and find it to be products that contain fava beans or other bean flours are just not right for substituting for your old non-gf flour. I just tried Pamela's and loved it, as close to the old way things tasted before being diagnosed."
2,"ok, but theres too much bean in the mix","I bought a case of this and use about 1/3 of this along with rice, and soy flour. I dont like this mix at all. The beans gas up my husband so much he cant eat it and it has a strong taste. I get stomache cramps from it. I'm on a gluten free diet and i like the other flours better than this one."
2,GAS!,"Always looking for good gluten free products, I tried this. I did not realize when I bought it that it was mostly garbanzo bean flour. I made some chocolate cookies that turned out fabulous, moist, firm, not crumbly. They did not have a ""beany"" taste but if I eat more than 1 cookie, which I do some times, look out! I've had some bad times with the pain, gas, and bloating that this product is causing.If you can tolerate the beans than I would recommend this flour but if you are like me, steer clear! I now have 3 bags of the stuff that I need to give away to someone, ugh!"
3,Bob's Red Mill All Purpose Mix,"I have a gluten intolerance and have recently started a gluten free diet. I decided to try this all purpose mix to see if I could sub 1:1 for regular all purpose flour. My cookies came out great, but the aftertaste of the bean flour in Bob's mix is awful. I'm going to try mixing up my own blend of flours. I don't think I'll buy this again (and I'll stay away from all bean flours from now on!!)"
2,Everything tastes like falafel!,"I've used this flour now to make a variety of things and it's true, it's very beany. As soon as you mix it with your wet ingredients it even feels like hummus, in addition to smelling like you just opened up a can of chickpeas.That being said, I didn't mind it as much as when I made a pizza dough for roasted eggplant, but it was utterly stomach turning when I used it for chocolate chip cookies. 2 stars because it does have some good uses, but I would not call it ""All Purpose"" flour. Perhaps save it for your savory dishes and find another mix for sweets."
2,I am not a fan,"This flour has a pungent after-taste, a little sour almost. I think it's due to the garbanzo bean flour. If you are using a recipe with strong flavors that will mask that, this flour will work, but if not, this flour will give your baked goods a sour flavor. I prefer King Arthur gluten-free all purpose flour."
1,Not for me,"I used this flour to make homemade egg noodles, and they were really gross! They smelled like vegetables and tasted even worse. I've made gluten-free noodles before with a white rice flour blend, and they turned out great. I recommend Whole Foods 365 brand or Gluten Free Pantry brand all purpose flours (1st ingredient white rice flour) for cooking and baking. Those blends look and feel more like white flour, and you usually can't even tell the products are gluten free."
3,Taste too strong,"The 'beany' taste and smell was a little too strong for me. Made some gluten free donuts with it. The texture of the donuts were very nice, but the donuts tasted.. well, beany. Guess if you were using this for some stronger tasting baked goods, like something with cocoa powder in it, it would be okay."
2,The flavours just aren't right,"I have been baking wheat and gluten free since I was 18. After moving to the US and needing to find which GF flours over here were the best to use, I jumped on Bob's Red Mill because it was so much cheaper than the King Arthur Flour version. But now I know why. The garbanzo bean (chickpea) and fava bean flours create an after taste that is too overpowering. Try a bit of the flour yourself before cooking with it. It tastes off, even when it's a fresh bag. It is barely useable in flavored cakes - chocolate or banana for example bring the nasty after taste to a minimum but it's still there. For use in eclair pastry, scones or gnocchi? I can't do it.I should add that texturally it performs well and I want to like it, I really do. Add the right amount of xantham gum and your cake batter and even pastries will hold together well. The flavor just ruins it for me."
4,"Good, but additional ingredient required","We are slowly shifting to gluten free in our household for a variety of issues, and baked goods/bread seem to be the most challenging to find an acceptable substitute for. The taste of this flour is great, I was already using mostly whole wheat flour so I like a bit deeper taste. HOWEVER, this does NOT contain xanthan gum, which most gluten free baked goods need for texture and to help rise. Even the recipes on the package call for xanthan gum. It isn't cheap, but it isnt super expensive to buy in addition to this, and recipes take very little of the gum so it will last for a long time.Depending on price, you may want to buy the Dolmata Gluten Free flour as the xanthan gum has been added already. But this flour even with the additional product was lower at the time."
1,Bean flour is overwhelming!,The bean flour is overwhelming and ruins the taste and smell of pretty much anything you bake with this flour...too bad. :(
1,Horrible taste,Grabanzo bean flour does not taste good in baking anything sweet or in my opinion anything else. I ended up throwing it away. It's interesting how our taste buds differ as I see some people like the taste of this and I can't imagine how it could possibly taste good.
1,Horrible Taste,"I tried to make cupcakes for my wheat-intolerant mother using this flour blend. I was pretty excited, because my previous GF attempts had involved rice flour, and the cakes would come out quite gritty. So I whipped up my batter and just before putting the cupcakes in the oven, I decided to take a taste. This flour produced the MOST FOUL TASTING thing I have ever put in my mouth. Ever. I thought I might be sick and had to spend about 10 minutes brushing my teeth to get rid of the taste.Don't buy this. Save yourself."
3,Very Good,"This item is very good - it bakes up well and tastes almost like wheat flour.Just like other things I have bought from Amazon.com, I have come to expect the beat. This is an excellent alternative for wheat flour."
1,Absolutely disgusting.,"Can I give 0 stars? Being that this is primarily made from ground garbonzo beans, it tastes exactly like.. ground garbanzo beans. The first time I used this, I made GF pancakes. I almost threw up. They tasted like someone chewed up chick peas and spit the paste into my cast iron pan. No amount of syrup could fix it. The next time I used it, I was running low on rice flour so I used about 1/4 cup of this ""all purpose"" stuff. Again, ruined pancakes. This stuff is horrible."
3,didnt like it,"nice,reaLLY GOOD quality product,buy it,, my relative will be so excited.......to get this as a gift ...really awesome ,wonderfulAwesome"
2,Can't use this product,"I am giving it 2 stars because I absolutely LOVE Bob's mixes. My favorite is the Vanilla Cake Mix. BUT this product I unfortunately bought a case of and I cannot use it for anything. I cannot stand garbanzo beans in the form of flour. I like it prepared other ways but in flour it makes EVERYthing taste like it. I recently made cheese garlic biscuits with it because I assumed that garlic would mask the tast of the garbanzo. WRONG!!! :/ It was EXTREMELY noticeable even though I added a lot of extra garlic and cheese. We ate them because the TEXTURE was nice. If you have taste issues but like the texture of things, then this baking mix might fly. BUT if taste is what you are looking for then I would go with Pamela's baking mix or quite frankly, it is easy to make your own."
4,Not what I thought but still works,I'm new to ordering on-line for gluten free foods so when I ordered this product I thought it had the xanthum gum already in it. But it didn't. It wouldn't have mattered but I never seem to get it right when I add the gum. So I try to avoid the mixes that I need to add any.So I use this flour for cooking like adding into casseroles. Just not baking. :-(So I like it still since it was a great price for flour.
2,The Garbanzo flour kind of ruins it,"I love Bob's Red Mill and as a gluten-intolerant person, am very thankful for their products. Over time since I've GF I've learned that some GF flours taste funky, sour or just plain nasty. Garbanzo bean flour fits the bill. It is so overpowering. Other than that the texture of the baked goods using this mix is good. Just be aware of the garbanzo flour, it's a bit much. My search is still on for a good GF baking mix."
2,Only for savory foods,"I made a pie crust for an apple pie out of this flour. I had to throw the apple pie out. The flour smells and tastes like garbanzo beans, because that is it's main ingredient. It worked fine for a curried steak and kidney pie, so I will be only using it for savoury dishes that can be spiced up Middle-Eastern style. Unless you have celiac disease, I highly recommend spelt flour for sweet baked goods. It actually tastes better than white wheat. I usually use whole grain in combination with oats and flaxseed for some healthful muffins, but the white spelt will give you the same baking results as white wheat, particularly if you are making fragile pastry or baked goods with yeast."
5,Great Product!,"I have been gluten free for years and have tried many products. This is the best flour, I have used it making just about everything, even ravioli! Its the only one that works in every recipe I try!"
3,It's pretty good for certain things,"This flour works fine for certain things, depending on your taste preferences. It has a very strong aftertaste (kind of bitter/sour) because of the bean flour. Thus it is pretty strong in plain breads and rolls. If you don't mind that, then good for you! (My husband is pretty sensitive and can't tolerate the bean flour or taste very well.) I found it works better in cookies, chocolate or spice cakes, brownies, banana bread, and pizza dough. Because these baked goods are made with other strong flavors, they help mellow out the bean taste which can be pretty overpowering if you don't have something with which to temper it. I like the consistency of this flour better than the rice flour blend I've also been using but again, consider your taste preferences and what you'll be baking/cooking with it."
1,Stinky!,"This flour stinks of Garbanzo beans, and I like Garbanzo beans on any other occasion, but for some reason the smell is so strong when ground, I have learned to read the labels of GF products and if beans are the first ingredient I will not but it. My guess is some people are more sensitive to it then others, it almost makes me gag when the flour is wet. I do have friends who don't mind it or don't notice it, but me and my non Celiac boyfriend think it's nasty. Since we love to bake, I have found that equal parts white rice flour and Tapioca flour with a teaspoon of xanthem gum work great in place of flour."
2,Its BEAN flour,"I wish I could use this flour. I'm new to gluten free and didnt think of the issues ""bean flour"" could cause. The taste is fine and the banana bread recipe on the bag is wonderful UNTILL its digested. We all had horrible gas pains. I tried it in a couple of recipes but our systems just couldn't adjust. I had to throw the rest of the bag away."
3,Good for beginning GF baking,"If you're facing a life of gluten-free eating, I'd suggest one of the many blogs out there to find recipes and to make your own mix of all-purpose gf flour. There really isn't a cup for cup replacement out there and lots of intrepid bloggers are re-inventing your favorite recipes to gluten-free. In the meantime, this is a good place to start.The upside to this flour is it has a nice mix of flours and doesn't use rice flour as its main ingredient. However, the bean flours can make your recipes smell off (nothing like baking something and having someone comment on how gross it smells)."
5,The easiest GF flour,This flour is great. I have substituted 1 for 1 for regular flour in many recipes and they have all come out great. (I'm still working in eliminating the xantham gum flavor). This is a much better buy than buying it at my supermarked or health food store.
5,Very Happy,"I needed this book for a class I am taking at Columbia University. Because I chose Super Saver shipping, I didn't get it as fast as I would have liked, but it arrived just in time and in great condition. I am very happy with this. It looks like a great collection."
5,An excellent collection of stories to teach with students,Wolff's collection of contemporary American stories serves as an excellent springboard for teaching high school students modern fiction. An excellent teaching tool. And the students enjoy the stories almost as much as the teacher
3,"Very good, not great.",I purchased this pack after a recent trip to Eastern Europe for a trip to South America. I read all of the sterling reviews and have another Osprey product that I love. It met all of my expectations but I was disappointed to find a major design flaw that prevents me from endorsing it entirely. The backpack has just a small access zipper on the front that makes it impossible to utilize. In order to get anything of consequence into the pack you must unzip a large zipper flap on the back of the pack. Other than that it is a great product.
2,Good idea...poor exectution with the adhesive pads.,"This is an excellent idea and the optics are excellent for the price. You can see everything all around the car that you ever want to see, including yourself. Thus, it's great for us narcissists.However, attaching it with adhesive pads doesn't cut it. Mine stuck for a few weeks, then after the first really hot day the top pads gunked up and popped right off. Never could get it to stick again. It should just clip on somehow.I got the full dual replacement mirror made by the same guys and that [other] one rocks because it just completely replaces your existing one. This one, and its adhesive pads, live at the landfill now."
4,Umbrella + Compact Fluorescent Bulb,"I use this product to mount a true color compact fluorescent bulb with a small silver umbrella to use as a general desk light stand in my studio. The product is sturdy and very functional. The bracket has swivel function and mounts on a regular light stand stud. This is well made, not like cheap store brand counterpart.There are two points of weakness. One is that the attached cord is too short. You'll probably want an extension cord. Another is that, the switch is located right on the bracket, not in middle of the cord. So, when you place the light high up on the light stand, it's not easy to turn on/off.If you are looking for video production light, I think you want to get one with two or more lightbulb sockets, so that you can get more light. If you are using it as a general desk lamp, or accent lamp in a room, one bulb is probably enough."
1,Well. . . it's Pretty!,"I hate to give such a low star-rating on my first time out, but even at $15.00, this thing was a waste. It's slim and pretty and a fabulous pink color, but at its absolute highest setting, I was getting no stimulation whatsoever. Set it on my husband's arm, he could barely feel anything either.Wouldn't even recommend it to a virgin. Spend $10.00 more at most and get something that'll get you off."
2,An academic on Gadda,"Written in the worst sort of ""post-modern"" gabble that now afflicts literature departments, the book will nevertheless provide some pointers to those who are able to rise above the apocalyptic language. English and Comparative Literature professors ought to be forced to write as much like Emerson as possible."
4,Lanyard works great!,The lanyard works as advertised. I use it daily. My only complaint is that the white cord gets dirty.
5,excellent recording,great selections for an outstanding brass group. similar to a tape i had years ago that is not available now.
4,A toy for professional use,"I'm an amateur concert percussionist, and I needed a slide whistle as a sound effect for a concert. The reviews of the $2 plastic slide whistles were pretty bad, so I splurged for the $10 stainless steel whistle. I think it was a good choice. It is sturdy, slides well, and attractive. (Visual appeal is part of percussion performance). My only criticism is that it isn't as loud as I expected, but then I really didn't practice before I needed to use it.If you want it as a child's toy, I think it will be fine. Because it is all heavy gauge metal, it would be hard to break."
3,"Great as a toy. Too stiff to be a ""professional"" instrument.","As a semi-professional wind player, I'm always on the lookout for something new and unusual to add to my collection. I had really hoped to be able to play this as a musical instrument rather than an amusing sound effects maker. I would, perhaps, be inclined to give this a higher rating if the description had not mentioned ""professional orchestras"". After all, what can one expect from a toy?Unfortunately, the slide moves so rigidly that it can really only be used to make children laugh and adults look at me askance. It does not provide the liberty of movement necessary for subtle pitch changes when attempting to play something potentially melodic.My real disappointment came when I made the profoundly naive mistake of performing a Google search on the phrase ""How can I lubricate my slide whistle?"".If you're not laughing now, don't run the search yourself to find out. You won't like what you find."
5,Slide Whistle - NICE!,This is a high quality item. A much better value than what I thought it would be for the price I paid. Fast delivery and over-all very satisfactory in every aspect.
4,Good Sound,"This slide whistle provides a quality sound. Just be careful with little kids, as they shouldn't play this and run with it, as if they should trip, that would be dangerous."
4,Child Favorite,My daughter wanted a slide whistle for Christmas and absolutely loved this when she opened it. It was exactly what she wanted and she hasn't stopped playing with it sense. Took a little longer than I expected for it to ship but received it in plenty of time before Christmas.
3,Alto slide,"I was hoping for a smoother slide and a higher pitch, but it's solid and sounds good. It has a tight plunger that makes smooth glissando a bit difficult."
4,heavy but can get full range of sounds,"heavier than anticipated so gets tiring to blow it for prolonged periods. the slide is rather stiff, dont know if it will loosen up with time. at the high notes, you have to blow at a different angle and greater strength to get a sound out, else, it would just be hollow wind at those high notes. easier to blow the lower notes. great fun though."
2,not what i ordered,"so this slide whistle says its a grover-trophy, but it doesn't say that anywhere on the package... ive been looking for one and bought one off amazon and didn't really like it (it got stuck and had a very wide mouth)... so i returned it and bought one from a different company... but low and behold its the exact same one! it sticks and has a very wide mouth which makes it hard to use effectively. im an adult and all the reviews said it was for kids so i thought it would be small enough to be comfortable. but its not =( ..... so i guess there's not a market for quality slide whistles hahaa....anyways... buy at your own risk."
2,Good Start,"Good start for a beginner but I would have appreciated seeing other efforts from people around the USA who have also accomplished a lot for the soldiers in this book. It is not just one person who has supported the troops the past couple years. There are countless, nameless Americans who have come through for our soldiers in so many ways, which I have witnessed in my own small community. The amazing patriotism and respect for our soldiers has been outstanding. I'm hoping to see an expanded book of the many Americans coming together in support of the troops that will represent all these supportive heroes behind the heroes serving our country."
1,vapo rub,nothing more than vapo rup. hot menthol.used buned us both ky product much better. not for us. will not try other menthol products.
1,NOT WORTH IT!!,"I have previously used this product in the past and the store that I was getting in from closed. I thought that it was a deal finding it again,but the company has changed the ingredients. This product doesn't work at all!!! It was a waste of money to purchase it!! It did work GREAT before they changed the main ingredient, now it's like putting baby oil on with no stimulation period! I had to find another product to use....thanks a lot M.D Science Lab for messing with a good thing!!!!"
5,Lynn Hanna does it again!!!!,"Taking us again to the Scottish Highlands, Lynn Hanna has written another book full of legend, lore, and romance. Kyle makes a wonderful hero and there are plenty of appearances by Matt, Rainey, and Sasha (and Malcolm, Emma, and Angus) to keep THE STARRY CHILD fans satisfied. Chapters one and seven are particularly powerful not only in the writing but in the emotional tug. And for those of you who were delighted with the surprising twist at the conclusion of TSC, Ms. Hanna does not disappoint. Her surprising twists at the end of books are going to become her trademark, I'm afraid (I hope <g>). Run, don't walk to the stores and get this one!"
2,Where is the third book?,"The two books are good, but the second left you hanging with the promise of a third book. So where is it?"
4,Nice easy read.,Nice easy read with some fantastical (is that a word?) for fun. And I like happy endings. Blended in well with the first book and a nice setup for the next book.
4,A good read,"While I liked this book, I didn't like it quite as much as I did ""The Starry Child"". This book seemed more like a run-of-the-mill romance novel to me than did her first book, which first attracted my attention because of the folklore element. I read the book very quickly and thought it interesting and well done, but I just couldn't help feeling a little disappointed. Nonetheless, I recommend it, especially to those who enjoyed ""The Starry Child""."
3,A whimsical journey into Highland Territory.,"A bit of a fantastical waste, but an amusing and magical tale in its own way. This is the story of the Macinnes family, a Scottish family empowered with special powers of a sort. They have the ability to commune with spirits, ancestors of old, some telepathic qualities, as well as the ability to conjure up and see faeries and fairy dust in magical forests. The story begins when the father of the Macinnes clan is downed in a horrible plane wreck, and from there the reader is taken into lands unimaginable and fantasies galore. It was a bit too Wonderlandish for me, but a good escape on a quiet evening in front of the fire if you are so inclined. The romance aspect of the story is truly washed up and overused, but the rest of the tale is bouncy and magnetic."
5,Excellent! You have to read this book.,This book ties together the love of a family and the almost special powers of the three women in the story. The characters are so real and powerful. The message is still one that love conquers all.
4,Excellent NOS Album!,The album came to me heavily packaged and in excellent condition! I've been wanting to purchase this album for years but could only find used copies.Brilliant!
3,Song List,OutlawsGhost Riders1. Ghost Riders In The Sky2. White Horses3. Angels Hide4. Devil's Road5. I Can't Stop Loving You6. Wishing Wells7. Sunshine8. Freedom Walk
3,MORE ROCK THAN SOUTHERN ROCK,"I first bought this when it came out years ago, I thought it had gone further away from the southern sound of early albums. I find it still good but not great, at this point they had went more in the direction of main stream rock which I thought weakened their sound. They sound like your classic City rocker's instead, but I did buy a CD of it to complete my collection."
1,Where's the beef?,"Most of this audiobook appears to be an excerpt out of one Mr. Hall's seminars. The seminars might be good, but the audiobook is practically worthless. It provides basically no useful information, except for some simple common sense --- that a strong story, good props, and good voice make an effective storyteller. That info is nice, but the audiobook fails to tell you how to improve these key ingredients. Don't make the same mistake I did by buying this audiobook."
4,Great illustrations,My grandson loves music so I purchased this book for him as it was based on the Woody Guthrie song. I was amazed at the quality of the illustrations. They are amazing.
3,Great if you do more research....,"into the little sayings and tidbits of trivia littered throughout. Still, nice art (a little busy at times) and a quick read with sheet music and bio at the end."
2,Sadly outclassed,"Nanofictionary is a game that just doesn't live up to its promise.Because of the way each player tells their own story, there isn't enough interaction between the players: it feels like everyone is off doing their own little game. In addition, since the stories are so short and have multiple required elements, it seems like the stories practically write themselves and there isn't a lot of room for creativity.I really wanted to like this game, because I've like multiple Looney Labs products in the past, but I found that it was outclassed in every particular by another storytelling card game, Once Upon A Time, which turned out to be more fun, more entertaining, and led to a whole lot more laughs. I recommend if the idea behind Nanofictionary sounds fun, buy Once Upon A Time instead."
1,not what I expected,"We received two of these for a wedding gift. My main use for a can opener is opening large dog food cans for my three dogs.A can opener doesn't do you much good when it won't open the cans you primarily use. So, when it wouldn't open a can I unpacked the other can opener we were going to take back. It wouldn't work either- so we took both back and bought the B and D gizmo instead- it works great."
1,disposable can opener?,"I bought this Black and Decker can opener in January-it died in 3 months! Just purchased a Rival can opener at Target, hopefully it will last longer."
5,Wow what powerful album,This is where you can almost touch the realms of phychedelic world. This album is very extremly powerful. So warning this album is ment for and produced for experienced listeners of Goa/Phy Trance only cause if you have never heard this type of music be prepared to be blown away.DJ TomCraft you RULE !!!!!
4,"I just want to rate the song ""Something More""","I like to call the song Train's unknown hit. I LOVE this song, I listen to it every single morning. It's just so different and I think it's even better than most of their singles. Even if you don't buy this CD, which I think is a ripoff, buy the original Cd, even just for this song."
5,Excellent backdrop stand!,I received the stand very quickly and it was nicer than I had expected! I am very happy and would shop here again in the future!
5,Una mezcla del jazz de Jade con la inspiración de Invisible,Disco magnífico para todos aquellos que admiran el trabajo del Capitán Beto. Es una mixtura entre los míticos trabajos de Invisible con la vena jazzística de la banda Jade. Indispensable.
3,"Good, but...","Not too much to say on the mount I recieved. It is an Anchor brand and it went in just fine however, the torx bolt that goes in to mount the engine needs to be replaced now. The portion of this mount that the torx bolt fits into is larger then OEM and now I need to find a bold that is approximately 1/4"" to 1/2"" longer to adequately secure the engine."
1,These lights make too much noise and I can not get help for JTL,I purchased this kit and discovered on my first shoot that they hum terribly making them useless for a video shoot. I have contacted JTL several times without a response. I talked to several other filmmakers who had exactly the same problem. For this reason I can not recommend these lights for video shoots.
2,MCSE Training Guide - Poor Step by Step Examples,"Not impressed. I understand Firewalls very well and some people may even refer to me as an expert. I hoped to learn about ISA by Step by Step examples. Unfortunately this book lacks well explained examples, descriptions and details. I needed to configure ISA to publish (and protect) my internal web sites but found only one poorly explained Step by Step Example on this subject. The example referred to other Step by Step examples which I found to be very confusing. I do not recommend this book."
2,Not for exam prepping- this bk leaves out the middle ground,"As with a lot of books this book does a great job of getting you familiar with the basics. It is very well written. However, it doesn't bridge the gap, which is true with a lot of books, between being simple and adequately preparing for the exam."
5,THE book to prepare for Exam 70-227,"MCSE ISA Server 2000 Training Guide AUTHOR: Roberta Bragg, MCSE, CISSP, MCT PUBLISHER: New Riders REVIEWED BY: Barbara RhoadesBOOK REVIEW: This book is a wonderful guide to help prepare you for Exam 70-227. The print doesn't give you eyestrain there are notes and exam tips in the margins and graphic examples of what the text is talking about.17 pages of contents, Appendices A-G, a 16-page Index AND a CD-Rom give you plenty of support as you study. The book is hard bound so you can read it without fear of the pages becoming battered as you carry it around. Don't forget, there are chapter summaries, review questions, exercises and exam questions included to further aid in your preparation for taking the ISA Server exam.If your goal is to pass this exam, this book is a MUST HAVE."
4,You can change characters in Gauntlet,"Hello AllI really love this compilation, a lot of old favs are here.The main reason I'm writing is to let people know how to change character in Gauntlet, I couldn't work out how the same as one of the reviewers above but found the solution on a site after much searching.Basically load the game, before clicking play hit (square) instead for options you can choose the character your credits go to there.I was gutted when I thought I was stuck playing Warrior, now I'm happy as Larry.Cheers"
1,controls suck,"This is the problem with reading reviews before you purchase something, sometimes everyone is wrong. The controls for this game SUCK. The only games I like are the mortal kombat 1, 2, 3, triolgy. I have MK 2 on the ps3 network and that was a good make over to the new system, however the change over to the psp was not so great. There are long loading times between matches and the sound is cheap, unlike the revamp 5.1 dolby digital for the ps3 version. and the controls are very unresponsive, you have to use the analog stick to jump and the directional stick to perform combos and other special moves which I find incredibly difficult to do. BAD BAD MAKEOVER."
4,The original Mortal Kombat,"This is the only Midway collection that contains the first Mortal Kombat game, so I bought it for that purpose. All the rest of the games on this collection have been released before in one of the many Midway Arcade Treasures for various game systems.My main disappointment with this collection stems from the fact that there isn't an option to change the screen orientation of games such as Spy Hunter from horizontal(stretched-out version) to the original arcade vertical screen(whether with borders or by turning the PSP sideways).But otherwise the games look and play pretty much like its original arcade counterpart. There is also a nice assortment of games. You can pause during game-play to alter the control-scheme or exit the game, and that's about it. Before you enter the game, you can go to an options screen to change the difficulty or save feature."
4,Its Okay I Guess,"The Game Includs 1980-1995 Games Such As Mortal Kombat 1 2 & 3 ,Tobbin And Much More . I Would Recomened This. This Game Is Rated By Me T-M Teen To Mature"
4,Great value for $30,"I'm glad they final released this for PSP. Overall a pretty decent compellation. Half the games are great...the other half probably could have been left out.This is worth buying alone for just Mortal Kombat 1,2,3. Some other good ones are Spy Hunter, Defender, Paperboy, 720, Klax, Joust, Marble Madness, Rampage, Gauntlet, Rampart, Championship Sprint, & Arch Rivals."
1,Aweful,"The only decent games in this collection is the Mortal Kombat Trilogy. Unfortunately, it plays terribly. It is sped up and the controls are bad."
2,"Salty, soggy and not too nice","It is a quick meal when you need it, but hopefully you won't need it too often. I guess you can't expect too much from a two-minute meal, but it would be nice if you could expect more than this. It is an easy kosher meal when you don't have a kosher microwave."
2,not so shocking,"the lighter was convincing, but i couldn't get the battery out to change it.. other than that, it shocked everyone that tried to use it"
5,Retro OS,"I needed an older, yet semi-stable OS that would support a retro machine I am cobbling together. I have a number of older flight sims that will not run on anything newer than Win 98SE, and this is going to let me enjoy ""flying"" Jane's F-15E and LongBow2. Can't wait! THe vendor delivered what they promised on time and in excellent condition."
5,A to Z Cables a very positive shopping Experience,"When I bought Windows 98 from A to Z Cables I didn't think much about the experience. After all is an old OS. The OS arrived I installed it and didn't think much about it. About a week later I received another copy and called A to Z to return it. Chris was extremely professional and explained that for the Holidays in order to get the products to the customers on time they ship two orders for last minute shoppers. I offered to send it back, but he insisted that I keep it. As it turned out I need it. I would do business with these folks again and again. Someone who's that dedicated and professional to the customer deserves to get repeat business. Thank you."
3,Elementary introduction to linux/unix programming,"This book does a decent job introducing basic concepts of unix (system) programming. It would be great for a newcomer to linux/unix. However, the unix/linux specific information is very incomplete - searches on google for related topics often yield more useful leads. On the system programming aspects, beyond the basics, this book is of no comparison to classics like Stevens' ""Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment"". It only skims various system calls without detailed description of what's going on behind the scene, which most seasoned unix programmers would consider important. For newcomer who prefers a more rigorous approach to learning unix programming (but not as detailed as Stevens'), I would recommend Robbins' ""Practical UNIX Programming: A Guide to Concurrency, Communication, and Multithreading""."
