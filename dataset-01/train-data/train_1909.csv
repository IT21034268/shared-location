4,Traaza Ghee,"Taaza Ghee is very good and it's quite nutritious for just about anyone. Ghee is simply butter from which the milk solids have been boiled out. The remaining is near pure oil so it is O.K. for those who have milk intolerance. It is superb as a cooking oil - doesn't smoke like butter and some other oils. Also, ghee can be stored at room temperature, best away from light.My complaint is the cost. It is twice as expensive as butter. For those who need to stay away from milk (dairy) products and don't want to heat olive oils, etc., use of ghee may be worth the price."
3,So-so performance captured in good sound,"I've listened to this performance a number of times over the past few months trying to discern why it has garnered raves. Frankly, I find this a redundant recording notable only for the performance of ""Blumine"" and good sonics. The symphony is accurate but bland. Zinman doesn't seem to get beyond the notes or have much of an interpretative perspective on the work.Gergiev's First is one of the weaker installments of his rival SACD cycle on LSO live, leaving Zander's Telarc SACD as my favorite among recordings in state of the art sound. Zander is appropriately coupled with a very fine performance of the ""Wayfarer"" songs that share thematic material with the symphony. Walter's Sony recording is still a favorite. That disc and Horenstein's edgy account on an out of print Unicorn disc cover the options very well."
2,item would not work as expected,"i bought this cable as i had wanted to connect my old laptop to my new one for file transfers. after finding this usb to usb cable, i was pleased at the price and speed of shipping, however upon its arrival, there was a sticker on it stating it was expressly NOT for use connecting two computers together.this is fine, however that would have been helpful information to have had on the product page before purchase.consider this a fair warning!"
5,Worked for what I've Needed,This cable has worked great as a replacement male-to-male for my laptop cooler. It is long enough to reach both sides of my computer and the cable is reinforced on the outside well--I don't feel like the cord is overly stiff or overly floppy. Has worked great!
5,"Not sexy, not exciting but it works",Hey what can you write about a USB cable! It's your basic black - you plug it in. It works.
4,"A fine router, regrettable service though.","I have been using this router for about a year. It works fine, it's a good shape, simple, and the two collet sizes are a nice feature. It is the noisiest tool in my shop, and in my neighborhood.When I bought my router, within the first few weeks, I noticed a defect with the tool. The baseplate screws came from the factory with a bad tapping job. The screws came loose and fell out repeatedly during use, which prompted me to get it the router base replaced or repaired. DeWalt told me to go to an authorized dealer to get it fixed. The dealer called the company and then told me to buy a new base.The product was still under warranty and with the original sales receipt and neither DeWalt nor the dealer would honor the warranty.It's an ok tool, apart from the defect (which I had to repair myself). Unfortunately DeWalt did not stand behind their product warranty."
4,Great router!,"I had an inexpensive Craftsman router that I bought before this one. I had all sorts of problems with the Craftsman, so I swapped it for the Dewalt. MAN, what a difference. It was like going from a Yugo to a Cadillac. The Dewalt is powerful and has a great feel. The instructions are virtually useless, but this router is so simple and easy to use, there's no real need for them. The rack and pinion depth adjustment holds the bit with no movement at all and seems to be very precise. All said, I gave it four stars because mine had couple of chipped teeth on the depth gear, the finish of the paint was somewhat poor, and the depth adjustment knob is a little difficult to read. Yep, they're picky points, but this is a $150 fixed based router (which is a little on the high side to me). Having said all of this, I would buy this router again without a second thought."
5,Five Star Excellence,"I purchased this book from amazon about six years ago, and I love it. I would say this book is a combination of things -- It is educational in its realism and teaches by the best method of all which is entertaining the reader and making learning fun. There is nothing I found boring in the book and I learned so much. Secondly, and not less importantly,this book holds the reader's interest from beginning to end. It has edge of your seat suspense making it hard to put down, and a touch of romance -- a forbidden love that endures -- for those who enjoy romance. I will not tell the story in this review and spoil it by going on and on and on ... and on about what happens. The book description says enough. I have read this book twice and plan to reread it (probably more than once again). I think it is great!"
2,Disappointment,"Pages were all written in, pages yellowed and slightly smelly. I realize this is an older book, but the condition was way worse than as described. It was Poor!"
2,So So,"Seller sent the wrong size mattress not once, but twice! 5x cross country shipping later, we got the correct mattress. Smell was expected, and dissipated as others have described. Bed is *very* firm, even after a couple of weeks of jumping on it, and a week of sleeping on it. Expected more softness and give with 5"" of foam. Hopefully it will continue to break in and will become more comfortable!"
4,Excellent buy!!,This mattress was a great buy. I have suffered from back problems related to a car accident . I have had issues sleeping on any type of mattress but this has really worked out great for me.
3,"Romance Thriller, Paranormal Romance","The Villa was a very good story, which I thoroughly enjoyed. However, I didn't care for Midnight Bayou. I was extremely disapointed by the weired ending. And I do mean WEIRD. I'm not a writer, but I think I could have come up with a better ending.I haven't listened to the last story. Thought I would wait a while, since I was so put off by Midnight Bayou. Sometimes when you buy a collection, you get a mixture of good and bad stories. I feel like this is what happened with this collection.I would not pay full price for this collection. It's not worth it. Look for a previously owned set at a reduced price, if you are interested in purchasing."
1,Not so good,"I have to say of all the gluten free products we have tried, this is the worse! I had to spit out the first and only forkful. Just the smell of it is awful. It gets one star because it is gluten free and that is all!"
3,Nice for travel,"My son really likes this pasta dish. I like that he can take it to Grandma's and all she has to do is heat it up. It's like spagetti-o's. My daughter that never liked spagetti-o's doesn't care for it. I would like it to have more protein, but I have mixed in ground beef before and it turned out to be a full meal for him."
5,Great!,This is a great product for your gluten free kid! My seven year old loves it. I keep a case at grandmas so she always has something to feed him!
3,Not bad,"Works in a pinch, especially on the go. Just do not eat more than one at a time. As soon as I overdid it once, I never ate another."
3,"Decent, egg and gluten free product","This is decent to have once in awhile, although I don't think it tastes much like spaghetti, check the ingredients. It is definitely a product you will either love or hate but, it is free of a lot of allergens which is a huge plus."
3,Works for a toddler.,"My 21 month old daughter was diagnosed with Celiac at 14 months as well as an allergy to eggs, dairy, and yeast. One of the only GF foods she will eat is spaghetti. So I bought a can of this from WholeFoods to see if it would work for last minute or to put in her bag when visiting others. I tried it last night and she did eat it. She only ate about a 3rd of the can which is normal for my child as she only like small portions at a time. I added some seasoning and sugar and broke up the noodles which are an off shape texture. I tasted it and it was not the worst gf food I have tasted of hers but definately not anywhere near as good as the soy/potato noodles from bionature we prefer with my homemade sauce. I am glad the she is happy with it though. For now it works."
2,"Tastes Like Spaghettios, But Worse Texture","First of all, I'd like to say the picture on this can is very deceiving. You do not get long strands of spaghetti as pictured, but short, somewhat thick 2 inch pieces. The sauce is almost identical to Franco American Spahgettios (from what I can remember before my gluten-free days), so this will appeal to kids more so than adults. The noodles are rather hard and chewy, so the texture was the worst thing to contend with. However, it may simply be that gluten free pasta is hard to can without breaking down, so perhaps it has to be made that way. The can is a single serving size, so is a bit expensive if you factor that in. In conclusion, if you have a child that has to be gluten free and never had the chance to taste gluten products, this will probably be okay as they won't notice the texture difference. Otherwise, they may be inclined to spit it out (or at least swallow it like aspirin)."
1,"Icky, icky, icky","I was excited when I found this product, thinking that I had found a great, easy meal for busy nights. When I opened it, I was very disappointed at the unpleasant smell and when I actually bit into the noodles, I was completely disgusted- the texture was extremely bad, and they tasted like they'd been packaged and repackaged over and over again. Kids with undiscriminating tastes who just want something to look like what their friends are eating might find this ok- but it was absolutely inedible for me. I ate a few bites- forced my husband to try it, who also agreed that it was gross, and threw the rest down the garbage disposal. Good idea, bad execution. I have been gluten free most of my life and like many GF products and pastas, but this product really was unusually bad."
1,Kids wouldn't even eat,"I was very excited about this spagetti, but unfortunately, it was awful! The consistancy was mush, and my daughter wouldn't even eat it. It is a bummer, when you have a case of it!"
3,"A lot of sauce, a few noodles","The noodles and sauce tasted just fine, but there weren't enough noodles in one can to make a meal."
4,Great product,"Great product for kids with wheat allergies, my daughter loves it, eat's the entire can and asks for more. Have had a problem with getting a can of soup, but that is not how the majority of cans I received are, probably an assembly line problem affecting a few batches. I've returned bad cans for full refund."
4,Not bad.,"I just had my first can of this spaghetti and it wasn't terrific, but it definitely wasn't bad. The serving size is quite small, so I imagine that its intended for the meal of a child. Mine specifically didn't come with as much of the [gluten-free] pasta as I expected, but a lot of the tomato broth instead. However, overall I was happy with it because it satisfied my cravings for spaghetti, which isn't always easy to get when you're a celiac and you need something quick and easy."
3,Easy GFCF food,"While I was not completely happy with the product, I am still buying it. I have found ways to really enhance it. I use the soup as a base for a recipe I made."
3,Spaghetti or Tomato Soup?,"The first thing you need to be aware of is that these cans of ""spaghetti"" are tiny--about the size of small mushroom cans.Second, the spaghetti is literally floating in the sauce. I dumped the can's contents into a bowl, and my opinion did not change. Fortunately, my daughter likes tomato soup, so I told her to try it and pretend it was tomato noodle soup. She liked it. But as spaghetti, it's downright comical."
1,Horrible Product,"This product should be called bland tomato soup with a few ""noodles"". I was so excited to see a ready to eat (gluten-free) pasta product... however, this does not resemble spaghetti, gluten-free or not. I've had some terrific home made gluten-free spaghetti that most people cannot distinguish. Therefore, the excuse for bad taste here has nothing to do with it being gluten-free. Overall this product has bad texture and even worse taste."
5,First trip a dream,"Used with a Volvo XC70 for our first camping trip of the year. Installation was a breeze (did it solo, but should have had someone help - did so for removal) and it performed excellent during the trip. MPG were only minimally effected - loss of ~1 mpg over normal levels. I was able to cram so much into the box that I had excess room in the car! The only issue I currently have is where to store it. Think about this before you buy one of these things - they don't just ""fold up""! Bottom line: it did what I wanted and I'm glad I bought it!"
1,Attach system weak,"I have both an Atlantis 1600 and an Atlantis 1800. Good boxes. Problem is with the attach system. While simple, it was probably designed by a Swedish monkey. The part that sits on the cross bar of my roof rack fails at the screw attach point. It is a very weak fitting and held in place by one screw. The monkey would tell you this is not a bearing point for load. Why then does it always fail in this spot?? Get this - the replacement part is $2.60 from Thule direct AND they want $20 for shipping... Now that's a business model!"
5,Good product,"I am very happy with the cargo box. Very easy to attach to your rack. Locking mechanism is well put together. No complaints. If I could change one thing, I would have gotten the next larger size."
4,"Just Another ""B"" Movie!","This film is really good. I'm telling you its worth having it in your collection. Bob Hope, Gracie Allen, George Burns and Martha Raye is funny as usual. Betty Grable in this film dancing it up. She isn't her usual pin-up girl self but if you want to see the early years of her, this is it. This film is a good film to watch you can kind of see what the 30s and 40s were about, the music and dancing, they way they talked, the slang they used. Out of all the films, I think this if the film that will let you see the culture of the 30s and 40s, and how they were young and wild, not much has changed. Just different music and dancing. The songs in this movie are great, Martha Raye singing How D'Ja Like To Love Me, What A Rumba Does To Romance. Great Fun."
3,All-star Paramount comedy is loads of fun!,"Paramount continued its string of all-star, mostly forgettable comedies with this sparkling gem. Mostly curiosity pieces now, these silly plotlines were mainly a gimmick on which to hang Paramount's roster of stars. Watch Bob Hope trying not to crack up as he and zany Martha Raye sing a duet. Anytime you can catch Hope and Raye on the same bill, you're in for some laughs. Betty Grable hoofs it up with then-husband Jackie Coogan. Burns & Allen add tons of fun, although curiously not working as a team. The music as typical swing of the 1930s, but the zest, energy, and pure fun with which it's performed makes this a very pleasant entertainment."
2,Something you should know before reading this book,"This book does not reflect official doctrine of the church. It was written and published independently by Orson Pratt, it was never an official church publication. Even at the time of it's publication the book did not do well, circulation peaked at only 400 copies, and Orson Pratt lamented to his brother parley ""The world will not subscribe for nor read The Seer"". In 1865, twelve years after its first publication, the first presidency officially disowned the book stating ""The Seer [and other writings by Pratt] contain doctrines which we cannot sanction, and which we have felt impressed to disown, so that the Saints who now live, and who may live hereafter, may not be misled by our silence, or be left to misinterpret it. Where these objectionable works, or parts of works, are bound in volumes, or otherwise, they should be cut out and destroyed."""
5,Sonoma Delivers Fun,"I've always been a writer, but Sonoma's Riffworks has allowed me ease of sketching out musical ideas as well as being to complete demo worthy compositions so I can market my ideas. It has been well worth the investment and continues to be a tool I use on almost a daily basis."
5,Great and Easy to Use Software,This Software is amazing... After recieving the package in the mail I was able to just plugin the guitar port install the software and go. I had no problems registering the software. This is by far the easiest guitar recording software I've ever used.
1,does not work as advertised,"unlike peter anderson i have not been able to get the guitar port and rifftracker to work together , i am sure its something simple , but since i can get no support from line 6 or its forums . i feel i was gyped on riffworks . the guitar port works fine . i would recommand it . but do not waste your time and money on riff works .you can hook it up to your guitar amp , go to radio shack , explain what you want to do and the have the connectors ."
3,Bravo Ennio,A quirky little film with some fun and interesting supporting performances... and Pia certainly has her lolita'esque charms. But the real star of the movie for me is the excellent soundtrack by maestro Ennio Morricone.
5,Just Superb,"I'm going to gush. This is one of my favorite books on literature.Initially I had trouble getting past the title. Was this going to be a sort of ""Dickens for Dummies""? No. The author skillfully interweaves Dickens biography with trenchant, readable criticism about the prose.She also is skilled at placing the man and his work within his 19th century contexts. For example, her little sidebar on the Victorian idea of death being ""slipping away"" is extremely helpful.She accomplishes a lot in a few pages...dipping into about a hundred years of criticism and commentary to pull out the best nuggets.And this book is funny.And she underlines a lot of the sex that lies underneath the surface of this writing.And she loves Dickens.Buy it."
4,Hudson Bible,"If you're a collector or interested in the history of Hudson cars, then this is the Hudson bible. It shows most (not all) of the cars built by the company and details models, production numbers, serial numbers etc, which I have not found elsewhere. This hardcover book has lots off pictures (all in Black & White) and is the definitive Hudson, Essex and Terraplane reference. A MUST BUY for the Hudson enthusiast."
4,Good reference book on the middle ages.,I found the book to be easily readable and makes a great companion to the other reference books that I have on the Middle Ages.
5,A great book on Medieval Times!,I highly recommend this book. It is really good and full of historical information on the Medeival times. The subjects are divided by chapters. It is well written.
3,This is a fascinatingly outsanding book...if you are a H....,"This is a fascinatingly outsanding book...if you are a History teacher or a philosopher. I am a parent of a 9th grader in the High School, and my son was required to read this book by the end of the summer. He disliked it very much, because it was basically a textbook - with the different chapters that were all quite monotonous. I know this because I read the book myself, and I found it more interesting than my son found it, most certainly, but it wasn't a good book in the least bit. The only way I would find it interesting would be if I were researching the Medieval times. Enjoy!"
2,"""Clean Up Woman"" is fair.",I bought this CD for the title song. None of the other songs the CD were spectacular or anything special.
5,"""Did I just deck Hitler?""",So glad this is on DVD. Widescreen and a great print as well. This is a fun and silly action/sci-fi pick from Empire Pictures(Before they became the awful Full Moon Entertainment). Fast paced and with decent creature effects by John Carl Buechler(Ghoulies). Check it out!
4,Not a bad movie,"It was like it was done by two separate groups of people. The combat sequences, German & American uniforms, the K rations, tens radios and weapons sounds and all that was excellent. Darn the Germans spoke real German not Hogan's Heroes German.Now the alien part was pure old Godzilla movie with very fake animation sequences, costumes the whole bit.Nice touch at the very end the old WW2 ""Buy War Bonds in the Lobby."" All in all not a bad movie."
4,Pretty good B-movie,"A pretty good B-movie with a good plot,top niche acting,really good 1940's music, and a good movie overall.However only one flaw....It's on DVD-R! Although I have no problem with being on DVD-R at least it got a DVD release somehow but it could come with nice features such as interview with the cast and crew along with a behind the scenes or a making of, but this just my rant. In conclusion It's a good B-movie overall,give a watch if you stumble upon it."
5,Taste great but wish they were fresher.,"These are my wife's favorite crackers. She has been unable to locate them locally, so we bought them from Amazon. As with some of the esoteric food items I've bought from Amazon, they are out of date. In this case the crackers were as crisp as they should be, so I didn't deduct a star. We got them March 20th, and the package said best if used by March 15th. We had to get 12 boxes, so I hope they stay fresh until they are gone. If not I will update this review.Update Feb 1,2013Finally used the last of them. They were just as crisp and tasty 11 months after the expiration date."
5,"A true perspective, very well done..","Recollections of a Boy Marine opens a window of insight to the enormous sacrifice our servicemen make to ensure our freedom.This is a fluid read, concurrently evoking in the reader emotions of being happy and proud for those who finally make it safely home, sadness and grief for those who don't, anxiety from the stressful situations our soldiers endured, and anger concerning the politics in Washington that result in the real endangerment of our military personnel out there doing the dirty work. This book takes you right there- I felt as though I was on the battleground myself, alongside this Marine. Authentic photos emphasize this true reality.As a refreshing touch and final conclusion, Dr. Ciliberti offers a creative, workable proposal for world peace. This is an excellent book and a very worthwhile read!"
5,Hands on - and coool stuff - in colors!,"This is THE additional book you will benefit from owning when working with Photoshop 6/Image Ready 3!Large pages, deliciously laid out. Practical format to have between your monitor and keyboard! (It's wide pages stay open even if you lean the book towards the monitor, I have tried it, so I know!)The illustrations are in colors, wow, wich is rare in the how-to-book-business. The illustrations are also very explaining, you see in an instant what you will get by doing what the text tells you to."
1,Missing steps,"If you want frustration, buy this book. The author leaves steps out of the text. Mr. Foster may know what he is doing with Photoshop, but he does not communicate it well."
2,Not bad,"I wish I had time to grow chives (and the green thumb) but since I do not I purchased McCormick's freeze dried chives. I used them in 3 dinners this week and they don't have much aroma or flavor. All they seem to do is add a little color. I would stick with the fresh chives from the grocery since these don't seem to translate as well as McCormick's rosemary, parsley or basil (which I have tried and love)"
5,"A precursor, but great in its own right.","Another great Meyer album that's OOP. I won't go through each track, but included is:-Meyer duet with Jerry Douglas-Meyer duet with Mark O'Connor-Meyer bass solo-Meyer with O'Connor on guitar and fiddle and Douglas on dobro-Meyer duet with Bela Fleck-Meyer classical composition with violin and cello and bass (of course)-Meyer duet with Sam BushThe standout track, for me, is ""The Expedition"" which is the duet with Fleck. It's totally in the ""Uncommon Ritual"" and ""Music for Two"" vein, which is a good thing. At times (maybe on two of the tracks), the album contains a bit of dated sounding synth, but since it's Meyer's work, it's actually very listenable. It's just a shame that people can't easily get their hands on this recording.A personal comment: it's odd to me that this recording includes the Strength in Numbers personnel, but not all together."
5,"Good scholarship, and a fascinating read, too!","I found this book well researched, well-written, and absolutely fascinating. It describes the lives and contributions of women on the frontier, as Iowa was in the 1840's through 1870. It covers women's work, their homes, their family lives, their work outside the home -- I found particularly interesting the study of the impact of the Civil War on women's lives, and of women's work to support the war effort. Since most histories of the frontier experience concentrate on men, this work fills a gap by illuminating a largely ignored facet."
2,Medium mouthpiece patch,"These patches were too thick for my likeing. If yiu want a patch but something that doesn't get in the way, I suggest a thinner patch."
3,"Yeah, but. . . .","It seems the market has turned from adventure novels (Clancy, et al) to lawyer novels. Maybe if all the lawyers turn from the courtrooms to writing novels, we would have a less litigious society.Nevertheless, the two main characters have fun. I had fun, but not as much as they. If the author can put me where the characters are, that's a good book. Reading this, I was watching the characters without much identification with them."
3,The politically/culturally neutral review the world has been waiting for...,"The book does a decent job of covering the subject matter, though the 'players list' begins to confuse. The prose is good, and the research covers most aspects of the situation. If you're interested in the subject, pick it up -- just don't approach it as the 'be-all, end-all' of Boxer Rebellion reportage."
3,Vivid details but too many names.,"I like this book very much because Diana Preston succeeded in describing this historical event as if she had been there and seen everything with her own eyes.What I hate about this book is that there are too many names in this book. I wanted to learn more about events in istorical context but she was more interested in people who had been caught in the Legation Quarter in 1900. Furthermore, even when she tried to analyze some important events, she almost always borrowed other people's mouths: Mr.--- said like this. Miss.--- thought like that.I have no big compalint about the contents which she delivered in this book, and I really learned a lot from this book. But I can't like her writing style. Should historian avoid talking in his/her own language?"
2,Book is only moderately interesting,"WHile I find the time in history interesting and have a better understanding of why the Chinese government is afraid of religious sects, the book itself was only so-so. I found it often repetitive with some facts stated over and over again, maybe in case I had not read the page before. The book was also dull at times and does not tell us enough about either the Boxers and who led them and what they believed, or what happened afterward. It is worth reading but parts are better skimmed."
2,Where are the Chinese?,"This book could almost have been written in the early 20th Century, by any returning missionary. While the prose is fine, the story itself is rather one-sided. Basically, the book is full of vignettes describing the plight of the foreigners in Beijing, but there is barely mention of the Chinese, especially the Boxers. Addtionally, the poor use of Wade-Giles to represent Chinese city and family names is frustrating."
2,Gossip or history?,"About 400 pages of mildly entertaining and - to a point - readable but rather forgettable stories (or rather anecdotes) of tragic to joyous events diligently culled and collected from letters, memoirs etc. of the foreigners (mainly English speaking ones) trapped in Peking and Tientsin in the year 1900 during the Boxer Rebrllion with a woefully inadequate sprinkling of historical analysis... I wish I never bought this book. If you wish to read a historical account - this certainly is not the book you are looking for. I find it highly overrated by most previous reviewers."
3,An appetizer without the main course.,"This book was well written but it covers only the westerner's side of the story. High marks for details of individuals'experiences in the legations. This is a good eye witness account book. However the narrative can get a bit tedious as there were too many bits and pieces that failed to make up the whole story. It does not tell you much about the motivations of either sides involved other than putting simply to greed and egos. The chinese was basically reduced to the status you normally see of natives in a black and white Tazan movie. This book is only one third of a complete story. The other two thirds being from the point of the chinese, both christians and otherwise,as well as an indepth analysis of how the events arose and ended. For research purposes, this book has very little to offer. It's a good read, which unfortunately makes it sadder because of what it could have been."
2,Where are the boxers?,"This book should please the casual readers, those who liked the film with Charlton Heston and Ava Gardner and want to know more about the historical episode it was based on (but not too much). Several books have already been written in that fashion on the same subject in the past. It is not of any interest to those other readers looking for who the boxers were, who commanded them and where they fit in the long history of peasant uprisings in old -and not so old - China. In the book, so little is said about them that they seem to have landed in Peking from another planet. So many times, reading it feels like being a foreign settler looking at what's happening outside the legation compound through a hole in the wall... Very long, too anecdotal and a bit boring."
1,Just like that awful Charlton Heston and Ava Gardner movie,"A well-written book that treats the European and Japanese invaders-and-occupiers-and-exploiters (and Christian missionaries dedicated to converting all those ""pagans"") as victims.If you like this sort of thing -- and can't really understand why the Chinese (get this!) ""resented"" being invaded, occupied, and exploited -- then this book will be a real delight; ditto that awful movie starting Charlton Heston and Ava Gardner; ditto (for that matter) Faux News."
3,"Interesting Start, but Wanted More China, Less Legations","I was looking for a book about China when I picked up The Boxer Rebellion. While it partly satisfied me, I found that I grew bored with all the accounts of what was going on inside the seiged legation quarter. I jsut wasn't all that interested in these people after the seige was lifted.I'd have preferred more info on China at the time, where the Boxers came from, the response of the other provincial leaders in the south, in short a fuller picture.If reading it again, I'd stop as soon as the relief reaches Peking."
4,A Worthwhile Read,"A very interesting story that has been exceptionally researched and documented. I strongly recommend ""The Boxer Rebellion,"" though I do have a couple of criticisms. First, the narrative (rather like the relieving army!) gets bogged down on occasion. Second, while Diana Preston is a good writer, she's not as vivid, lively, and inspired as others who have written on similar subjects: Thomas Pakenham, Christopher Hibbert, and Byron Farwell, to name a few."
2,Too much trivia creates a maze of confusion,"I rarely put down a book never to finish, this book became ""a burden to read"" I usually look forward to my nightly reading. Last night I could no longer force myself to read this work. I found this book to be boring and packed with mundane details of the lives of the ""foreigners"" living near the rebellion. The author takes several liberties to inject her politcal perpesctives that detract from the objectivity expected in historical writings. I will try another author that hopefully does not drown the essance of his/her writing with useless bulk."
2,A poorly titled work,"Although a well written book, this book is too one-sided to merit it's title. It is merely a military account of the westerner's seige in Peking. This book focuses FAR too much energy on minute details (..the rations alotted to Mrs. so-and-so on such-a-day ) with only cursory comments about the Boxers, China, and any ideaology of the Boxer rebellion! Nevertheless,I read the whole book, solely because of the author's writing prowess. All in all I was thoroughly disappointed and feel like I have learned very little about the amazing culture of China."
3,Liasons not for the lazy,"This workbook is good for those determined to learn French, but if you're looking for a leisure-listen-to-some-tapes in the car learning method you've selected the wrong workbook. Liasons, available with tapes, is used at major universities to supplement text book assignments and classroom work. This work utilizes various methods in order to challenge and target a vast array of learning methods, but it can be challenging and tedious to get through all the exercises."
2,"Interesting, but bizarre and sometimes frustrating book","This is not a good book if you want objective, factual, and clearly explained historical information. Also, the maps leave a lot to be desired.There's an awful lot of the author's opinion in most of the writing. Often, facts are couched in a writing style that expresses the either the author's opinion or an attempt to be humorous or witty.If you want a quick read that will leave you wanting to know more, and don't mind *a lot* of opinion, this book is okay. It should definitely not be someone's only introduction to the history and issues of the Middle East that it attempts to introduce."
2,Hmm.,"What to say about this book?Yes, it is biased to the nth degree- it has no pretensions to the contrary, though, so we can't fault it for that. (...)It can run thin on certain topics- like early Zionism, for example. Much better books on the topic from a similar viewpoint exist, such as Chomsky's 'The Fateful Triangle'- a scholarly, tasteful, and engaging, if also unashamedly biased, exploration of the subject. Just note how readily David regurgitates him; obvious 'borrowing' is an obvious sign of quality.However, this is a good ultra-quick, ultra-dirty guide both to the flaws of the status quo and to 'anti-Zionist' thinking. It's perfect for debates and light essays- both for easy collection of facts to back up one's argument and understanding 'the other side'. Think of it as Cliff Notes for Chomsky and Said, if you will- it would be a grave insult to author, viewpoint it represents, and reader to think of it as anything more serious."
1,Not well written.,"This is the first book I have ever returned to a bookstore. I think this was written by a child or was poorly translated from another language. The writing is not professional or objective. The author has decided that the cause of conflict in the Middle East is because Israel is wrong.I will have to say that the illustrations in the book are very good,I think that's why I was fooled into buying it."
3,"read it, but carry a cellar of salt!","This book is certainly biased, not least because it doesn't provide a dispassionate outline of Israeli-Jewish aims from a Jewish perspective. However, it provides valuable facts that you'll never hear in the U.S. media, so for that reason alone it's worth reading. I think it is a good beginners book because it will inspire readers to read further, and that's what this conflict needs - a better-informed world.David has a flippant style, which is irritating on occasion, and the book is full of typos, some of them glaring. He's also unforgivably causal with his facts on occasion, for example a number is 35,000 on one page and 3-5000 on another.Well worth the cheap price, but only if you're prepared to follow up with more - of course, that goes for EVERY book on this subject, all of which come loaded with their own agendas!"
1,"Extremely one-sided, non-objective point of view","I am trying to find out the truth about the conflict and was very dissapointed. This book only contains the bad things the Jewish did. I did not say that those are not facts, but in order to be objective and to learn the truth, information was needed from both sides. The author also put personal comments that were very sarcastic. For example, after describing about a man who cruelly murdered Arabs, he said ""Sounds like quite a guy!"". I personally as a reader did not need those sarcastic comments. I want to be able to make my own decisions about what I think. If the author intention was to present his own point of view on the matter, certainly he has the right to do so. However, maybe the title should be different. The title should clearly said that this book was his own point of view and did not represent the Jewish point of view. I felt deceived and manipulated."
5,"""The truth hits everybody!""","AWESOME...is the best way to describe this book. Not for the diehard Zionist. This book presents the truth about Israel since its inception, Israeli apartheid rule (not Democratic unless you're a Jew) and the thievery of U.S. taxpayers dollars.True, there are some crucial facts about Jews under Islamic rule that are missing. However, it doesn't cover the Spanish Inquisition either. Read this along with Chomsky's Fateful Triangle, Said's Question of Palestine, and Ralph Schoenman's Hidden History of Zionism and you'll get a pretty clear picture of the Zionist philosophy. If you really want a shock, read Jewish History, Jewish Religion: The Weight of 3000 Years by Israel Shahak ...Enjoy."
4,A Required Objective View,"More than a protest against Israel and an insistence on nullifying the existence of the state, the author urges, or rather insists on the objective truth to be exclaimed first, and then further debate to ensue. Some of the negative critique on this book were written by subjective, ethnically biased, close minded hotheads screaming that Ron David promotes a one sided view. The 'other side's view'. They should consider the reality that so many of his statements made in this book seem so skewed to them only due to the factual truth behind them suddenly exposing misconceptions they had carried through their whole life. Prior to reading this book I also had a slew of them."
1,Unscholarly material,"I can see from the other reviews that this book has an audience. But it is simply antizionist propaganda with little connection to reality. I do not recommend it.Oh, there's some great storytelling. You'll discover that the ancestors of the Arabs (but not the Jews) lived in the area over 12,000 years ago. And founded Jericho! And you'll find out that the Jews were absent from the area for 1900 years. And much, much more. Even if such statements were true, they would be irrelevant to the Arab-Israeli conflict.If you want to know something about the Arab-Israeli conflict, there are plenty of reasonable books on the subject. My advice for a beginners level book is ""The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict,"" by Mitchell Bard. I also recommend ""Islam and Dhimmitude,"" by Bat Ye'or. And yet another reasonable book is ""The Rape of Palestine and the Struggle for Jerusalem,"" by Lionel Casper."
1,Whoever published this work should be arrested for incompetence,"This is perhaps the worst book I have ever read on the Middle East conflict. It is so simplistic so biased, so wrongheaded that one wonders why whoever put it in covers did so. It portrays little Israel as monstrous superpower gobbling up Arab lands. The Arabs own one eighth of planet earth and have not managed to put up one democracy in the twenty plus nations they have. This book is by the way not up-to- date and goes up only to 1993. I was particularly offended at the way it defamed the late Sa'ad Haddad head of the former South Lebanese Army, a true Lebanese patriot unlike the Islamic fundamentalists now controlling the territory he once worked to keep free of terrorists."
2,Bombast kills the message,"Writer's like Mr. David don't seem to understand that in presenting a wildly opinionated view of the Arab/Israeli crisis, they will inavariably alienate open-minded readers. Much of the information here is fascinating, and is certainly contrary to the myths and one-sided journalistic fluff that we're usually exposed to, but the author's sarcasm and borderline hysteria makes the message hard to swallow."
3,Fun Like CLue,This game was fun but it is just like Clue. I was hoping for something more original and really tied into the stories for us real Harry Potter fans! Talk to my mom if you want a game that Real Harry Potter fans will love. Still I think kids will like playing this Harry Potter game too <G>.
5,great family game,"My family enjoyed playing this game with our 9 year old daughter. She and I have read all 3 Harry Potter books but my husband has not. Even though it was based around characters, potions, and classes my husband had never heard of, he still had a good time playing the game.So you don't have to be up on your Harry Potter to have fun playing. This game is played a lot like ""CLUE"" only it has a few twists. I highly reccommend this as a great family fun night activity."
1,Why so expensive?,"I wish I had read the review stating that it is not worth over $100 before buying. I almost bought the Clue Harry Potter Game, but thought the more expensive game would have a beautiful board and wooden pieces - some sort of work of art at least, not just a cardboard playing surface and plastic pieces. I read the reviews that expressed how much fun it is. It may be fun, but I don't know. I was going to wait until my son opened it for Christmas to play it with him. I think I'd rather not now...."
3,"Good game, but a little disappointing","This game was a decent game, but it was just a Harry Potter version of Clue. Even though you don't need to know anything about Harry Potter to play, it defeats the purpose of making the game a Harry Potter version. Being a kid myself, I did find it fun, but it wasn't what I thought it would be. All you do it hop around the board guessing who did what with what and where. If I were you, I would by the trivia game, which is much more Harry Potter oriented. But overall, it was an ok game, and it is good for parents who know nothing about Harry Potter to play with their kids."
2,not what was expected,"this game i bought thinking it would be fun and have somewhat of an educational value at the same time. however, i soon found out i was wrong. it has its moments but overall it isn't very entertaining. i expected it to be like clue...an educational game that is built on logical explanations....so....i hope this was helpful in getting you to not waste your time with this game."
1,Died,Never have luck with plants online they die than you fight with companies huge waste of money - they say its your fault
3,Not what I expected,"When I saw this book in a book store it looked intriguing. I ordered it for my kindle from Amazon. I guess I was expecting more of a biographical type of read and it IS a biography, but it reads more like a social studies text book. There were times when it was tough to keep going as my interest waned, but there were other points at which I was engaged in her story. My main difficulty with this book is the writing style; Anna Dickinson was an interesting and influential woman. This book paints a well-rounded picture of her life and personality--both flaws and her remarkable gifts and strengths. It is well documented, and many period documents are quoted and cited. But with all that, this book read throughout with way too much talk about her impact on society and women's status and not so much causing the reader to feel that he or she has had a view of the woman's heart and mind."
3,Not perfect,"Not a perfect yellow color match for my Kata rucksack. Doesn't match the interior style/type of the factory dividers either. But it's flexible and ""good enough"" for creating the custom sized dividers I wanted, with acceptable padding."
2,Black tripod = less visible in reflections,"I got the translucent orange, 'cause it looks cool, and you'll never loose it, right?I regretted this after trying to use it to steady night shots out an airplane window.It kept showing up as a reflection in my otherwise 'city lights' shots.The product itself is great - just stick with the black one."
4,Great seat for options.,"I bought this because I didn't know if my 18-month-old daughter preferred the toilet seat attachment or to sit on the potty on the floor. This was great to try sitting on both. I don't think she decided yet which she likes best. We are slowly introducing it. The only thing I wish is it was a little smaller (it is a little too high off the ground for her since she little) and also I wish it didn't have the hump in the front for boys (she doesn't need it and it seems to get in the way of her sitting down).To summarize, I like the options this seat gives, but I would like it to have some adjustments (smaller + no hump)."
2,Didn't work for us,"My daughter loves this potty. But only to take apart and scoot around the bathroom. The main problem is the seat not being latched to the base. It easily moves around and once my daughter noticed this it became a toy that she takes apart and carries into other rooms. She's gone potty a few times on it and when she notices Mom or Dad going potty she'll pull it out and sit on it next to us, but not for long. I tried putting the seat on our toilet and it fits with a bit of sliding around but no way for her to fall in. Perhaps I'll try that for a bit and see how it works out. Oh another thing, the seat has crannies for pee to get stuck in that make it hard to clean. Not a plus."
5,Perfect for potty training!,"This portable model is nicely discreet and can transition from a place to potty in any room (we used it in bedroom and living room) to being used as a potty in the bathroom, to a step stool and potty seat for the regular toilet. My daughter is three weeks into potty training and we love it!"
2,toilet trainer,"dont really like this one, it is to hard for him to get on, and the part for the boy doesnt work well. disappointed for the price."
2,Okay seat but needs grip bottom,"We purchased this item for our daughter (just shy of 2 now) so we could ease her into using the potty. It is okay but I am currently looking for something else.Pros: Lightweight, no fancy buttons or anything requiring batteries, easy to clean up, separate seat that fits on toiletCons: slides all around the bathroom floor, handle broke off, cheaply made, no storage areas like other potties offer, when lid is down as stool it's too short for my toddler (who's very tall for her age) to reach the sink for brushing teeth/washing hands.Overall it's done the job, but when the handle broke off recently I decided it was time to look for something else."
2,Not what I expected.,"I have never written a review on here before, but after my experience with this potty, I thought I should. I bought it on here after reading great reviews about this training potty. I have to say, it gets the job done and it's small for traveling, but that's the only good thing about it. It's cheaply made, which is not great for my very active son who climbs on top of everything and throws everything where he can. Today, one of the handles broke off and anther broke in half, though it is still attached to the seat. It had a lot of nooks and cranies to clean, and I have had a few messes to clean up because of the urine guard as well. I have yet to use the portable seat on a real toilet so I cannot tell you my experience on that, but it is a hassle because it moves around a lot, as it does not attach to the training potty base."
3,Acceptable,"My expectations were not met. The seat doesn't fit snugly unto the base. My baby uses it mostly as a standing stool and because of the finishing on the cover it becomes dirty easily and is difficult to clean. I do however like the rails on the seat and its portable feature. The fact that it is so big means that she hardly moves it around, but she does put her small toys in it just the same."
4,My daughter liked it.,"This is our first time potty training a child and we feel lucky that we found a good product. The seat seems comfortable. My daughter likes to hold the handles. It's very easy to dump and to clean. I like knowing that the seat can later be used on the big toilet. It will make the transition easier since she will be familiar with it. Also, the price is reasonable so we bought two of them. One for upstairs and one for downstairs."
2,Plan to return,"This was delivered on time but I didn't open it right away cause my son isn't old enough yet. The seat seems sturdy but the ""soft"" cover has scratchy gouges along the rim. I can't imagine that being comfortable for my son to sit on..."
4,Does the trick...,"I like this product... we got it for my 16 month old at Christmas so he can get used to seeing the potty and sitting on it, even though we're not potty training yet. My only complaint is that I wish the pieces would clip in place so they weren't so easy to remove. My son has taken this whole ""getting used to the potty"" thing to heart and likes to take the potty apart. Not an issue now, but I'm sure it will be once he starts using it!I also like that it LOOKS enough like a toilet that he tries to ""rinse"" his cloth diapers in it... (like I said, he's a fan)"
2,smear poop all over the seat,My 2 1/2 old daughter likes to scoot all the way back of the seat. It's not too much problem when she pees although she likes to look down and some pee just shoots right out. But it's when she poops. She likes to get up and look then seat back down and smears poop all over the seat. And there are lots of parts to take to wash then dry. I am back on Amazon to look for a different one.
4,Liked it so much we bought two,My son is just starting to potty train. We initially just bought one potty but figured out it is easier since we have a two story house to have one up stairs and one downstairs. He really likes this potty and uses it as a step stool to wash his hands. It is just perfect.
3,Potty toilet trainer seat,This toddler toiler seat is perfect for a girl but for a boy it has it's challenges. When he sits down to urinate it goes every where except in the toilet. He prefers to stand but that is hard also because the seat is not made for standing only sitting. This potty toiler is not made for a boy in training.
4,Love this toddler toilet!,"We absolutely love this potty! Our daughter started using it around 14 months, and still uses it at two and a half. We now use the seat on other toilets, it fits really well. It's comfortable to sit on, and she is perfectly secure. We also use the base as a step stool, and bring the whole thing in the car on trips around town. We are getting another one because we like it that well!The only CON is that you have to remove the blue squishy pad to clean. It's not that big of a problem though, and otherwise easy to clean."
5,A+,"this one is our 4-th, and final potty. our child got used to it very fast and loves it. it's a shame i did not find it earlier. highly recommend!"
2,Bad product,The overall product quality is poor. I am really disappointed. Toilet seat is not at all soft as published/claimed. Seat handles quality is so low that will break anytime.
2,Only the original sesame is the best,"I love Sesmark rice crackers, but only the original sesame ones. I didn't like any other flavor."
5,Delicious,We eat these almost every night as a very light and tasty snack. I also enjoy the original flavor.
2,Powermonkey,"It's been plugged into wall for over 2 hours charging. There were NO INSTRUCTIONS in or out of the box on how to use device. And, it's not easy to figure out. You don't know when the button is off or when it's on. No markings. No directions. No nothing."
2,Great product with poor accessories,The powermonkey is just what is needed for the traveler but the attachment cables are the weak link in the package. I used the powermonkey three times then on the fourth time the connector for my blackberry fell apart in my hand. So a product like this is only as good as the accesories with it. The company does not supply individual replacements parts so the whole unit needed to be returned.
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR $$$!,"The Power Monkey portable charger was used to charge two I-Pod Touch. It did not work for either one. The charger did not fit into the I-Touch securely, it can slip out easily. Instructions for the different adapters were not included. I would not recommend this item."
5,Guthrie Family Book,"The author of this book is a relative, so it was refreshing and exciting to discover a piece of my family history on Amazon book selections"
5,Tuxedo look,"I bought these for my husband, trying to find a replacement for a favorite pair long since worn out. He says they are comfortable, he wears them at home, not just while working online at work. An added plus: He looks very handsome in them, just as suitable with a tuxedo as a button-down collar."
1,Good looking but poorly made,"Right after starting to wear these glasses, I noticed that the frames often made a funny ""click"" noise when I would fold the arms in preparation for putting them down or into my pocket, but I could see nothing that might be causing it. Exactly 3 days after the 1-month return period ended, this funny ""click"" became a ""pop"" and the entire right-hand hinge came apart in several pieces. So it can now be neither repaired nor returned, as this happened three days past the cutoff date for returns. So although these glasses look quite nice and work well, the workmanship was poor enough that I would be very cautious before buying this model."
3,bad frames,"I was very disappointed that the frames can not be adjusted to the face, the frames do not bend at all without the possibility of being broke."
3,No Bach????,"I think this album is not good.Why?First,Because there is no Bach in this album.Although Philips put Byrd and Gibbons in this album,I think this album is not good enough.Second,Philips can put [Gould plays Mozart or Beethoven:Piano sonatas] in this album.But they did not.This is very strange.Only one thing I like is:Gould plays Strauss Five piano pieces.This is the reason why I bought this album is I like to enjoy Mr.Gould plays Strauss.If you like to enjoy Gould plays Strauss or Bizet,this album is a good choice.If you do not like Gould plays Strauss or Bizet,do not buy this album."
4,"""I Am Slim...Because I Want To Be Slim.""","An excellent subliminal recording that works, SLIM FOREVER FOR MEN delivers an easy to absorb positive message that weight loss is all a matter of simply changing one's mind.This recording includes a section on creative self-awareness, a series of affirmations, and a basic, softly played piano tune overlaid upon the messages of the first section.The narrator's voice may be a bit too ""New Age"" for some, but the lessons on this tape are messages that need to be impressed upon the mind whether the listener has a weight problem or not.Weight loss will definitely occur if the program outlined on the tape (at least once a day, every day, for six weeks) is followed. Other life altering changes may occur, too.Definitely worth the time for any man interested in self improvement, SLIM FOREVER FOR MEN is an inexpensive and effective way to begin the process of change."
3,Stale attempt at launcing a new elitairian hype,"Much too well produced in respect to the flavor, quality and atmosphere of the compositions. It is like trying to sell farmers outfit as haute couture, it does not do it right... Also I miss some deep wheathered soul that is usually immediately underneath the surface in gypsy-like music. Dancing to this music is virtually impossible without groteske amounts of home-brewn vodka."
3,Good Copy,The book came within the time period it said but I was spoiled how fast the other products I ordered came. The copy was good though.
2,Not impressed,"There were only a couple of stories and poems that I liked in this book. Overall, it was poorly written and lacked substance."
3,Nice Compilation of Sensuous Prose & Poetry,"Making Love In The Rain (MLITR) by Marlon Green is a sensual anthology that traipses along the variety of tastes that sexuality beholds. Through poetry, short stories and preludes, Green intertwines words with the metaphor of rain, and most importantly, making love in the rain.Green disperses poetry and stories in three chapters: the rain, the storm and the drizzle. More than anything, I really enjoyed the poetry, especially ""(Early) In The Mornin',"" ""Step by Step,""""Need,"" ""(Touch Me) From Afar,"" ""What's In A Kiss,"" and ""From Me to You."" The vastness of feelings that permeate from the pieces in this book is apparent and will be felt by those who read it. I especially felt wooed by the preludes that follow the opening of each chapter. They are so sensuously written that you become eager to read, to see what the rain has in store for you.I don't think there's one type of person out there who won't find something wonderful to read in this thick anthology. ..."
5,SHOWS JUST HOW SENSUAL RAIN CAN BE,"What more can I say. In the words of Tony the Tiger, this book is ""grreeeeaaaat!"
1,Book has a misleading title and doesn't meet my expection,"This is a small, thin book (160 pages cover to cover with large fonts). It talks about the features extra to only the Premier Edition, not to teach Quickbooks as a whole. For example, half of the book's content is about Internet remote access to Quickbooks database, and one quarter of the contect is about business planning, and the rest one quarter about something else.If your intension is to learn how to use Quickbooks software and its features and functions, this book is not for you. I bought it from Amazon and from the second I received the package, I know it wasn't right. Then I spent 2 days read through it and confirmed my fear. I am returning the book to Amazon."
3,Cute Story,"I enjoyed this book, it was a cute story but I felt there could have been so much more depth to it. Just wasn't quite meaty enough for me.I also found it a little hard to believe that a man like Howard ""Cash"" Bradford would have a girl like Delilah around just for 'eye candy' and that a girl like Delilah trying to prove everyone is wrong about her, would live such a lie. Wasn't quite convinced either that a man who trusted Delilah so much wouldn't tell her about his son sooner, that if he loved his daughter so much he couldn't admit his 'problem' to her and if he was such a tough old coot he would let someone sleeze blackmail him.It was a nice change though by the end of the book that Lilly came out of her shell and that Robert truly did love her and want her for his wife.A nice quick read all in all."
2,not so sparty,The mousepad was disappointing. It looked and felt very cheap. I would not recommend it.
4,One of the best I've read in a long time...,"This book was very entertaining and allows the reader to become immersed in the story. It is slow at times, but the story is complex and the ending is not dragged out to the point of being predictable.Caleb is a really great hero, because he says exactly what he is thinking and does not play games with Sophie. Once he knows his feelings he never wavers and his responses and reactions are very realistic.I disagree with the reviewer who thought the epilogue was rushed. I rarely have the opportunity to read a book where the rest of the character's lives are explained. I found the epilogue very touching and a perfect ending to this book. When you invest time reading a story, you want to know what happens to the characters past the next year of their lives. Julia London is a very talented author, but read her ""Charmer"" series first or you may not like Sophia's brother Julian very much."
4,A very well written sequel,This was a very enjoyable read. The characters were very real and likeable. I agree that the first 40 pages or so were a slow read at first but I knew it would get better. The story was very good after that and I really enjoyed seeing Sophie have a better turn of events from the last book. I also thought the epilogue could have just been left out. It seemed very rushed and I really didn't want to know all of the info given. It kind of ruined the story.
2,A Bit Boring...,"I never did finish it. I got about 2-3 to 3/4 done and realized I was only reading it to finish the story and not out of any enjoyment, so I skipped the the epilogue and took my dog for a much needed walk. My problem with the book is that none of the characters came alive. There are several times where London describes something happening without showing the reader. You know, the whole they talked about their lives thing without showing us them really talking about anything. I also found her growth to be a bit boring and repetitive.So this wasn't a horrible, throw across the room sort of story, but it was a yawn and put down story."
2,DISAPPOINTING ISN'T STRONG ENOUGH!!,"I have been an avid reader since I learned to read and have had a book in my face since Jr. High, in the 40's, when I discovered Pearl Buck. Have read almost everything from the Literary Guild to the Mystery Guild. I have read all of Julia London's books. But in ""The Secret Lover"" she went a long way to create a character that is so completely unable to think for herself, the most insipid, weak minded female I have ever read about. Yet at the same time created Caleb, a perfectly wonderful, kind, understanding man. Sophie actually disgusted me to the point that Ms London has lost a reader. Good luck trying to undue someone like Sophie in your next book."
4,Fabulous ending,"I just finished reading this book at 11 pm in the night and wanted to write my review right away. Others seem to have some mixed feelings about the epilogue, but I simply loved it, very poignant and sweet.I loved Caleb's character, to be loved thus....As for Sophie, she comes across as way too insecure and timid. I kept wishing she had some spine to stand up to people. She eventually finds it, thank goodness. I haven't read Julian and Claudia's story, but I don't think I will. They come across as such prigs, you wonder why in the world would you want to read in depth about them. As for the other characters, they all seem too theatrical and silly.But it was a memorable book, nevertheless."
3,Love it or Hate it.,I have enjoyed all of Julia London's books but this one was not as enjoyable as the others.The characters although having promise just did not seem as strong as they could have been. I was very disappointed in the characterization of Julian and claudia. They went from likeable hero/heroine in their own book to what I can only describe as self-involved and unlikable. This book was saved only in my opinion by the fact that it pulled on my emotions several times and required my to reach for my kleenex. I appreciate the time period and the scandal that was attatched to those that sought divorce and the fact that society did indeed play a large part in lifestyle choices and the author being true to this concept.All in all I would have to say that you will either love this book or dislike it. It is really something you will have to decide on your own.
5,"Good overview, nicely written","Nancy Adler presents a good overview on the topics in international HR Management. It is great as a textbook for class and a perfect starting point for novices who want to get into inter. HRM. The book is not overwhelmingly deep, but it is concise and has an efficient way of conveying the main concepts of culture and communication, synergy, teams, leadership, negotiations. Adler writes well making it easy to understand what she means and a fast read. She uses small cases to illustrate each problem she addresses, which are sometimes a little bit too simplistic for non-students. For me, a great advantage of the book is the comprehensive lists of references per chapter. This makes it easy to go further in topics I am especially interested in. The critique a have with almost all ""international version"" textbooks is, that it explicitly addresses Americans."
4,A Good Reference for International Managers,"For any of you interested in the multicultural aspects of business decisions, I would reccommend this book. It is easy to read, has lots of good information, and covers all the necessary heavy-hitters in the field of international cultural awareness. I was quite pleased with the way the author related various cultural teachings to short stories in order to grasp a mental picture. Not many books destined to be used in a classroom setting accomplish this very well. In today's business world, one would be committing suicide by not having at least a basic understanding in the differences between various cultures of the world, if not an in-depth understanding."
4,"Social- Business Psychologist, PHD student",It was the basic source for my MSc project. Very helpful and very modern in its writing.Nancy Adler reached her destination. Recommendable for cross-cultural social and business analysis
4,Good product,"I was hesitant about purchasing this item after reading the reviews but decided to take a chance. I'm glad I did. The scoop is large and with 3 dogs it holds a lot! On the down side, I could not get the handle to lock in the ""extended"" position. I read this is several reviews so I was aware this was a problem.This item is very well built and works better than the previous one I owned.Maybe the manufacturer will read these reviews and upgrade the locking mechanism so we could give this item a 5 star review!!"
3,Heavy-duty not!,"Precision Pet Little Stinker Heavy-Duty Poop Scoop with Rake, Small Panis far from heavy duty. The pans handle fell off after a few months ofuse. It did work well up until that time. The handle was glued ormaybe tack-welded to the pan quite poorly."
2,"Good, until it breaks.","Similar to a few other reviewers, the spot welds between the clamp on the handle and the pan broke. Unfortunately it took about 5 months for ours to go so no hope of a replacement. This under relatively normal use for our 2 dogs.Probably fairly easily fixable with a bolt or screw through the handle but for such an expensive ""heavy duty"" pooper scooper I expect more.."
2,broke after 1 month,"after using this product for just over a month, the pan came off the handle. we only have 1 dog, so its not like we over-used it or anything. expected way more for what we paid for it"
4,Nice,"This a very nice pooper scooper. It is a little big for my needs, but I love the adjustable handles. It's a little pricey though."
5,"the""beach astrologer""","Mr. Merriman's revised edition of ""The Solar Return Book of Prediction"" is the astrologers indespensible textbook for delineating ""solar returns"". It also explains timing the 15 month period of the ""return"" using primarily the moon's aspects to ""solar return"" and ""natal"" planets - to the point events are predicted to the month and day! Although, he doesn't put the return into quite the large perspective Ms. Shea does. He does show how to choose the ""solar return"" you want by being at an appropriate location at the exact moment of your sun's return to the exact degree, minute and second it occupied when you came into this world. I would dearly love to have his ""solar return"" program!!!!!!!"
2,no aporta nada nuevo,"lo compré esperando alguna luz sobre este tema de las revoluciones solares, pero es un libro de relleno, no aporta nada que no esté en otros libros, uno más, no vale la pena, ni siquiera terminé de leerlo"
3,simplicity,"it has many minimal yet innovative designs. i like the style. clean, simple, effective. good picture book. however it can use a more analytical side review for teach piece."
5,Ronnie Browne's a Celtic Delight,"I bought this CD for just a couple songs but with one playing I love them all. Scottish, Irish, Celtic ... this CD has a flavor of all three. Each song is beautifully sung (no high screechy voices) and creates an emotion in the listener. Just listen to Dumbarton's Drums and you will see what I mean. I just wish more of his music was available."
3,It's ok!,"I don't think I've listened to this CD enough to judge it but I'm sure if you listen to it every day religiously, it is bound to have an effect on you."
3,I am using it!,I am just not sure if it is working yet. I use it almost every night or if I take a nap.
4,Love side B.,"I have Ms Howell's ' Weight Loss ' subliminal cd and have been using it several days now and really love it so far.I went ahead and ordered this one as well, thinking it was another cd of only subliminals as I favor those over any guided hynosis which I have never had any success with, either with cds or in person sessions, nor am I am fan of affirmations that I do not believe about myself. Having me repeat things like ' I am in demand ' seems silly to me, as I am not in demand at all, and making me say it over and over will not make me believe it.This cd is a combo, and the fault lies with me for not reading the product description or going to the website, had I done so I would have known that the subliminals that I am seeking are only on side b, side A is a guided hypnosis with affirmations to say.I love Part B so far, but am glad I paid under $ 10 for it, as I will only be listening to half the cd.If you love affirmations, hynosis and subliminals then this is for you !"
3,Not Really Slim Forever,"I think this cd has a lot of potential. However, they don't focus on getting the person into a hypnotic state enough. Therefore, I never really feel like I can use this to my full potential. Nicoli's weight loss system is much better."
4,Very Good,"Nothing is a magic weight loss pill but this tape is as close as it gets. Very very rewarding. My thoughts about food were changing from the first time I listened to it.If you must drink coffee, this guy recommends coffee substitutes because coffee is high is pesticides and decaf can still contain up to 14 mg of caffeine per cup. He refers to it as having your morning cup of pesticides. So think of it that way and perhaps it will be easier to go off coffee."
3,"slim forever for women, sublimal self-help",I only gave this three stars as I have not used it long enough to know how well it will do. I reall believe it will help but want more time and then d another review
3,I have heard better,"I bought this tape as I lost another self hypnosis tape when I recently moved. My main gripe with this tape is that half way through the relaxion portion of the tape, music starts playing. Without fail, everytime the music starts I ""wake"" right up and the rest of the tape is lost on me. The music on the subliminal side is your basic white noise/new age music, which is relaxing if you like that sort of thing."
3,just started,"I don't know if this works yet -- my only complaint is that the music is so vapid and annoying that I can barely focus on the affirmations or make myself listen to the subliminal side. It sounds like the guy is practicing his piano finger exercises----and practicing badly. Very uninspired, not really even new age, maybe stone age. Get new music and maybe this will be better received."
5,"Had cassette, now have CD","I love this CD. I especially think the breathing exercise is helpful. As a male, I had the one ""for men"" and donated it to the library---I just don't want to listen to a guy with a husky voice...rather creepy. This one with the female voice, however, is excellent."
5,The best thing I ever bought!,This is the most wonderful present I ever bought myself. I listen to it daily and it has transformed my life. I am buying one for my mother next. This is one purchase you won't regret.
4,Brilliant End to a Major Sci Fi Series,A brilliant end to the series. She ends of the triliogy in a fashion that links up various series in a almost seamless way. Few authors can write a series over such a long period and make little mistakes in the time line. Truly an outstanding.
1,not a worthy finale,"The saga of the Plieocene Exiles was so good that it's almost unfair to compair the rest of May's books against it. However one would like to think that the finale would at least be compatible with the story told in the original series. This book is not. The metapsychic rebellion ends up presented as a minor piece of fluff, relatively inconsequencial compared to all of the build up. It was especially weak compared to the way the rebellion was presented in the original series.May remains a good storyteller, she just ought to keep her story straight."
3,took too long for all the books to come out,"I think that the galactic milieu saga was a bit long windedit seems to me that the author made a commitment to writethese 3 books in her first saga,but maybe lost heart alongthe way,and the end result was not what i had hoped for.It also took alongggggg time for the whole story to finishup, if you think that golden torc was written in 1982any way its a good read ,bit slow paced,and if you waitedfor a few years(like i did) for each book,well its o.kjust!!!!!"
2,Not a great ending. Rush job?,"This book isn't that bad, but it's not great. It's worth getting if you want to finish the Trilogy. But the Trilogy isn't that great in itself.The Saga of the Exiles was much better than the Milieu Trilogy. The latter seems like the result of a rush job compared to the former. A bit disappointing, knowing what Ms. May was capable of.Also as someone mentioned, there are many inconsistencies between the two. For one, in the Pliocene Saga the metapsychics were hurling mind bolts spinning illusions fairly easily. Whereas in the Milieu Trilogy, Marc (Mr Powerful himself) in his youth and most of the rest seem to be much weaker (except for farspeech)."
3,"1 Gold, 2 Gold, 3 Coal","May trully excited me with Jack the Bodiless and Diamond Mask. However, after a long wait, my anticipation for Magnificat turned to grief. The detail of the first two books of this trilogy played like a great movie in my head. This last book lacked detail, focus, and failed to flesh out a proper and satisfactory conclusion to previous character development. If you've read the first two novels, read this as well, but beware night light readers, the power of your pillow will defeat your attempts to read very far in this book."
1,"not useful, overpriced","The same item is available on Amazon under a different title for $1.45 at http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00012K7UU/ref=pd_ecc_rvi_f/103-4797890-7675868The photo on this page shows one hand holding the magnifier for use. In fact it is so flimsy that you must use two hands and hold it 4"" above the page you wish to read. Even so, it bends and distorts the image."
2,very disappointing,"I bought this magnifier thinking it would be nice to have for reading at night when I'm tired and have moire difficulty with small print. For this purpose, it is almost useless, The instructions which come with it say it should be held 4 feet from the page....which means you need 3 hands to read a book.I used it for the first time looking up a number in a compact phone book. Holding it the recommended distance seriously distorted the image. It was very dificult to read. I think this will, in short order, become an entertaining optical toy for my son (it is a fresnel lans).I'm glad I decided to order more than one magnifying tool because I did find one which was as good as this is disappointing. Although much smaller, the Fulcrum LED Card Magnifier is much more useful. The lens is clear (no distortion), it has a smaller area of higher magnification and a useful and very bright built in led. It's also very portable so I can always have one around when I need it."
1,does not replace a high quality magnifying glass,"This page magnifier is the size of a page, but the quality of the magnifying glass is extremely poor. If you raise the flexible page just a little above the page, all resolution is lost. It's like looking through high guage clear plastic, there is no clarity. It may serve a purpose for some needs, but I consider it a waste of money and I've gone back to my round magnifying glass."
1,Deluxe Page Magnifier?,Hardly deluxe---could have bought the same product at less than half at many stores.
1,Magnifier,This product was very overpriced. I ordered one for under $4 that was exactly the same as this one that was 3 times the price. I was very unhappy. Even the wrappings were exactly the same.
4,High fun,"I admit to being an eclectic reader. When I was driving 7.5 hours one way on a Friday and then back again on Sunday, I needed something that went beyond music. I stopped in a truck stop and perused the audio books. The Destroyer series looked fun.It has been sheer pleasure to listen to! I even (now that I am no longer driving so much) listen to them in the car for the shorter commute.Cheesy? Campy? Silly? Sure! That is exactly what makes them so much fun. I was a huge fan of the old Green Hornet series and these books remind me of that. They are graphic in description for sure, but listening to Richard Sapir read them is marvelous. He is very talented.I will be buying more of the audio books."
2,meh.,"Reading through her book, I did not come across anything I didn't know before. Read any parenting book or kid magazine, and you will have been exposed to all this before. ""Kids need boundaries"". No kidding. She writes much about how to mess it up, but very little about how to do it right (just doing the opposite isn't as intuitive as it might appear, and she offers very little concrete advice on how to do it up right). Near the end, when I was hoping for some info as to how to get it right (vs. just not doing it wrong), she starts talking more about teachers and school counselors and principals, rather than parents. I felt like I'd bought a book designed for school professionals, not parents. All in all, rather unsatisfying. Spend a few minutes in the parenting section here or at your local book store, and find something much more useful to spend your money on."
3,Defoe? Really?,"Officially, this book is taken for the work of Captain Charles Johnson. It is a compilation of narratives about various individual pirates from the Golden Age of Piracy, names like Blackbeard and Bartholomew Roberts (the dread pirate Roberts, from Princess Bride fame), Anne Bonny et al.The conclusion that Defoe and Johnson were one and the same has come under fire these last few years and is not the accepted fact it once was. This text includes portions of the original volumes by Johnson, but not the whole, although it can be argued that it includes the stories that most readers would want. There is also some question about the validity of the stories, but we may never know whether they are true or fiction. P-)"
4,Captain Charles Johnson vs Daniel Defoe,"I bought this book for two reasons 1) to read about my relative John Gow aka Smith and 2) to crossreference it with Daniel Defoe's book ""The General History of Pyrates."
2,Pirates,I didn't like this book. Although historically acurate it contains very general and lacks detail.
1,Only a closet Southern Sympathizer could have written this.,With so many good books available I don't know how I picked this to read. The author seems unforgiving that Sherman invaded the South and uses quotes without giving context to depict Sherman as a very shallow person with little military expertise. My advice is to find a better book.
1,terrible!!!,"There have only been a few books that I have read that I hated. Even fewer that I couldnt even finish due to how bad it was. This book tops both lists. I have a passion for the cival war as well as the men involved. I wanted to learn more about Gen Sherman so I picked this book up. I wish I had not. The writing is tedious and boring. The author may have spent 5 years researching the personal and military writings of William Sherman, but he should have spent another 5 writing a book that was worth reading!! I HATED this book!"
2,Better served elsewhere,"Probably closer to two and a half stars.While someone new to Sherman will get something from this book, the best biography still is Marszalek's. The Sherman in this book comes across (at least to me) as a cardboard man at times, which, having read Marszalek's book (and others), I knew not to be the case.Although the book covers his whole life and is over 400 pages, most of the important military aspects of his career (look at the subtitle) are given little coverage. A couple of pages each for Shiloh, Chattanooga, not much better for the Atlanta Campaign and the March to the Sea!Analysis of Sherman's relationship with Grant is cursory, which is a pity, because this axis was the major factor in the Union's triumph in 1864-65.I don't intend to keep my copy now that I have read it."
5,Another Excellent look at Sherman,"This too is a fine scholarly look at Sherman, all carefully researched and put together very well. The look at Sherman's brilliance as a soldier is very nicely done. Detailed and carefully explained are all of Sherman's military and personal experiences."
5,"Ahh, my Beauty!","I loved this book. It was a true beauty. A gem, an emerald even. Though it is one of the more tame Herge books, Tintin and the Captain never leave Marlinspike, it is one of the best. It is Hilarious. I would definetly reccomend this book!!!!"
5,A great book! A must be read!,"This book is very funny unlike the other Tintin books. My favorite Tintin book is the ""The Castafiore Emerald"". This is the story of what happens when Captain Haddock meets the Milanese Nightingale! I really think you should buy this book."
5,"Ah , these jewels , bright I wear!","Captain Haddock invites a group of Gypsies living on nearby rubbish dump to come and stay on a meadow by the stream on his estate. Meanwhile the Captain's nemesis, the Florentine opera star, Bianca Castafioreinvites herself to say at his residences of Marlinspike.Castafiore and her entourage cause the Captain no end of irritation , but the real adventure comes when her prize jewelry goes missing and it is up to Tintin to unravel the mystery.With the interplay of the Captain and people like Castafiore , the pet parrot , troublemaking journalists, and the insurance broker , Jolyon Wagg , this Tintin album is hilarious from beginning to finish."
4,One of the funniest Tintins!,"This isn't one of the best Tintins, but its definetly a funny one. The whole story happens at Marlinspike Hall. Castafiore comes. She misplaces her jewels once, finds it. 2nd time she didn't find it. It was supposedley stolen."
2,not as good as I thought,I knew I would need to sharpen the tool but I tried it and it is Ok. I have gone back to the original cutters for now.
3,A fascinating look at Chatwin and the nature of biography,"Shakespeare clearly started off worshipping Chatwin and admiring his writings deeply. As he went on with his research the hero worship is tempered by the reality he uncovers, particularly Chatwin's fictionalisation of so much of his life and work. For all his supposed charms, Chatwin comes across as a rather horrible person, sad, desperate, lonely, unable to come to terms with his sexuality and perfectly willing to make people suffer for it. This book has something of the widow's revenge about it as his wife comes across as a saint who put up with a monster of a husband. Chatwin was a good novelist, a good writer of travel fiction and a great stylist but intellectually his work is mired in the 19th century. As a person he seemed unhappy and ultimately destroyed by that. Shakespeare uncovers all the facets of this complex life in a fascinating, well constructed biography and neither builds up or diminishes Chatwin."
2,"Good reference. Not fun to read, by fermed.","This is a long book and a tedious one. I kept reading it in the hope that I would ""get into it,"" but when it was finally over I hadn't. Perhaps not liking it was my problem; perhaps my expectations were too great. I knew this man was a controversial but interesting figure, whose book ""In Patagonia"" had moved me deeply years ago; I expected great things from his biography.Was it Nicholas Shakespeare's prose? I don't know. It is hard to believe that one could be bored reading about such a hyperactive, outrageous and exciting adventurer. Much as I hate putting down the author's obviously monumental effort, I look forward to the day when Bruce Chatwin's life will be written about with the same vibrancy, intensity and verve with which he lived it.There is no doubt that the book is of great value as a reference and a resource about Chatwin and his life. But a good read it is not."
2,Flawed biography,"My main beef with the book was with its fawning biographer. I felt as if Shakespeare lost his objectivity, and fell under the star power of his subject. While he discusses Chatwin's flaws, he does so with an aspect of fan-worship, which, if one is to believe the biography, was par for the course - everyone fell under his spell. I would hope for better from the biographer - some more real balance, some real critisism.By-products of this were some seriously pedantic chapters. For example, the chapter about the cabinet wasn't painstakingly researched, it was painfully boring. I remember a relationship with someone who I loved so intensely that I was able to draw her likeness from memory, which was remarkable, given my complete inability to draw anything's likeness. Shakespeare appears to seek to recreate Chatwin through sheer intensity of concentration, spending inordinate time on irrelevant minutae. At the end of the day, he does his subject a disservice."
3,"OK, but I found another book I like better","Although my daughter's doctor recommended this book, I didn't end up using it very much, because I found another one that I like better:What to Do When You Worry Too Much: A Kid's Guide to Overcoming Anxiety (What to Do Guides for Kids)by Dawn Huebner. Ms. Huebner's book pretty much gives you the same tools as this book, but explains the strategies in ways that my daughter can easily grasp. I showed the book to our doctor (he hadn't seen it before) and he thought it looked great!"
5,Pepe Romero's talent gives new meaning to the guitar,These are among the best compositions ever written for guitar. Pepe Romero has a unique and distinct style of portraying each and every note that rodrigo composed. No other guitarist in the world has yet captured and portrayed Rodrigo's music as beautifully as Pepe Romero.
5,Rodrigo + Romero = WOW!!,"This is a beautiful compilation of a wonderful mixture of artist and composer. The Romeros play Rodrigo with brilliance, sensitivity and depth."
5,Joaquin Rodrigo complete concertos sfor guitar & harp,"If you like classical music, enjoy spanish guitar, you will love this. It is lighthearted, uplifting, & joyful to listen to."
2,Bad packaging of product,"These CDs were so tightly sealed that I had to get a box cutter to open it and when I finally pulled the jacket cover apart, the entire thing slipped out of my hands, fell to the floor and broke into five pieces. A simple piece of scotch tape from one side to another would have sufficed."
3,"Nice, if you like harps.","This two CD reissue of existing material is a very nice compilation. However, the harp material is not what I expected. It is a bit twangy and harsh. The material is best suited to a guitar, where it excels. Buy the original recordings on guitar."
1,Save your money,"This is a typical Verilog book, which isn't saying much. The examples tend to be contrived and mostly show how *not* to write good Verilog code - by the author's own admission! You won't find a decent example of how to model a flip flop until pg. 144, in the chapter ""Advanced Procedural Modeling."" If you really want this book anyway, buy it used and keep it for reference. After all, in the introduction the book says ""Some of the information you want might be outside the scope of this book. Some of the other sources are simulator reference manuals; and the comp.lang.verilog usenet news group."" (sic)You could also try ""HDL Chip Design"" by Smith since it covers Verilog and VHDL. At least it shows good style and thoroughly explains what each line of code is doing and shows synthesis results with small schematics."
4,Very good book for beginer,I was lucky to have James Lee class at ucsc/ca. This book willbe very useful for all reader from beginer to practical expert.
2,"fun, but flimsy","enjoyed playing with this ""ball"" for awhile. great tactile feeling, kinda gross and kinda cool at the same time.the problem is that it broke after 2 days. if it can't handle more than 2 days of stress relief not sure what it's good for."
1,Awful,The plug holding in the smaller balls fell out 2 days after using the item. All the balls fell out and had.to dispose of the product not even 7 days after my delivery
5,A MUST read for investors!,As an investment professional I have probably read more investment related books than most individuals. After awhile they all start to sound the same. This book IS different and well worth the read for anyone. Study it ... it will help you become a better investor.
5,A book for the ages,"Books worth reading either educate or entertain. ""More Than You Know"" is that rare book that does both and it does so masterfully. Mauboussin's interdiciplinary toolbox provides useful ideas for individual investors and investment professional alike. But many of the ideas transcend the investment arena and apply to our broader life experiences. Mauboussin's ability to connect seemingly far-fetched concepts to the investment process in a reader-friendly fashion is truly extraordinary. This is a book for the ages.In the interest of full disclosure, Michael and I co-authored ""Expectations Investing."" Be assured however that my collaboration with Michael, if anything, tempered rather than fueled my enthusiastic review."
3,"IT's Ok, but","The author had a lot of interesting points to make, but after reading the book, I didn't come away with a sense that I had learned anying in particular that would help me invest better. Perhaps ,this is because I have read about many of the things he covered from other sources. I felt that I was reading a book with a whole list of how-to pointers. There didn't seem to be any main theme that would make me a more effective investor.This may not be a fair assessment for other investors, because I've been reading investing publications almost every day for the past 16 years and it takes something fairly profound to make much of a impact."
5,Must read,"Wow- what a book. This book sheds new light on a topic I feel has already been covered. Phillips' personal interviews are fantastic. I would love to have Phillips for a professor, wait- I do. Phillips is the man, and so is his book. If you are reading this Dr. Phillips can I have a 4.0? You know who I am!"
5,"OUTRAGEOUS,OFFENSIVE...HILARIOUS",Happiness is a masterpiece for Todd Solondz in writing and directing. With wonderfully real characters and actors this is truly a remarkable piece. Dialogue and situations will offend everyone at the Rainbow Coalition.
4,Review of Alcatraz by Darwin Coon,"I found the book to be insightful, interesting, and a well written, entertaining read. I thank Mr. Coon for sharing his experiences, and wish him the best in the future."
3,"good reference book, covers many different engine types.","Good reference book but does not read like a novel. It touches on most of the important advances in aircraft piston engines but does not go into great detail on any individual engine. Rather, it gives an overview on many different engines spending more time on engines with significant step forward."
3,"Good coverage, but little depth","Generally I like this book, and refer to it all the time. I particularily like the conversational writing style. However it fails either in breadth or depth, so it you have to supplant this with other books as well.Forget about trying to get the history or real details on any particular engine. If you're looking for the history or lineage of something like the Jumo 211, it's just not there. But at the same time it could not be considered encyclopedic either. Only the major engines are mentioned, and even in that case there seem to be a lot of missing examples.Another problem is the low quality of the illustrations and photographs, but they do serve their purpose.Finally, I couldn't shake the feeling that this book really should have been better researched. The author often asks questions along the lines of ""I wonder why they did..."", when the answer is fairly well known."
3,It's an okay book,"Even though this book is okay for an afternoon's reading jaunt, it is hard to find and way overpriced. If you are interested in the details of the Homolka case and only want to purchase one book, I'd highly recommend ""Deadly Innocence"" as the most interesting book available on Karla Homolka.However, if you are buying ""A Marriage made for Murder"" to add to your true crime library and if you happen to come across the book for less than $25, snatch it up quick and consider it a worth-while investment."
2,Misleading marketing,"This book isn't ""banned in Canada"" per se. It, along with other books and newstories, were subjected to a temporary publication ban before and during the defendant's trial, because there is a general idea in Canada that big media frenzies reduce said defendant's ""right to a fair trial""; too much lurid press on a country-wide level make finding impartial, untainted jurors much more difficult.Once Bernardo's trial was over, this and all kinds of other tell-all stuff (however accurate or inaccurate) became widely available."
5,Great Clippers,"This are really good clippers.I bought a set about 6 years ago and I'm now ready to purchase my second set.Works great for one single cut.I cut my hair 2 times a week,Imagine having to pay 15 dollars per cut,It really pays for itself in a couple of cuts."
3,It's just OK,"Oliveira is completely lost, and so are Etienne, Gregorovius and the rest of the Club. Problem is they all talk like one person, you can hardly see the difference. And Cortazar as well. They use the same terms and are -not close as you may think- but very far from their feelings, in a pointless, cocky and false metaphisic adventure. Book goes bad up to chapter 21. Then, in chapters 79 and 22 has a chance to get through, but loses it. Rest of the book is mere distraction for the reader not to realize the failure of the author. Cortazar knows (as Morelli) what is needed to write a great novel, but he can't do it."
2,wading through beat-trash to find nuggets of good writing,"if you think howl is a good poem, then you will probably find hopscotch to be a brilliant novel. this book is chock full of bad name dropping and bohemian pretense. it didnt take long for me to tire of smokey rooms and bad jazz records. im baffled that everyone here is raving about this book...i mean there are some well written passages, but they are FEW and FAR BETWEEN. cortazar is definitely in the second or third tier of latin american novelists, he is no borges or marquez. the reviews here got me exciting, but the writing was extremely disappointing."
5,the world is a rayuela,"rayuela, as is the name in Spanish of this magnificent novel, makes us think about game, the supreme activity to distract the mind and to create, and that is exactly what the author is doing here, playing with the reader, taunting him/her to follow through the galleries of his creative mind, to find amid the pieces the jewel of creation.... LUIS MENDEZ luismendez@codetel.net.do"
5,How to read Rayuela,"This book is magical in that it must be read more than once, and with each reading, a new experience and understanding unfold. First, read it from front to back. Next, read it from back to front. And finally, read through it on a random basis, chapter at a time, in no particular order. I was first introduced to Rayuela in the late 1960's. It still sits on my bookshelf and every so often, I read through it again, and have another 'aha.'"
5,"Don't turn your nose up at the 'read it in the order you want' gimmick, this is completely brilliant","Ordinarily I wouldn't go for a 'read it in whatever order you want' kind of set up, but I'll be damned if the chapter sequence that Cortazar recommends doesn't create one of the most wonderful, richly delirious novels I've come across. Moving between Europe and Latin America, between delightfully vaporous intellectual ruminations, made up footnotes, excerpts from fake Utopian polemics, sections of modernist experimentation, brief impressions of Parisian street life etc., I found myself completely tangled up in the thoughts, dramas, dreams and occasional moments of pathos that make up Horacio Oliveira's life. And the bouncing back and forth between chapters beautifully reinforces the wonderful, stream-of-consciousness style. I can't remember many times when it was this much fun to slink through such a satirically over-intellectualized mind"
5,Trail Blazing,Hopscotch certainly makes my TOP 10 list of Latin American Literary classics of the 20th Century--with its exquisite flow of poetic prose and its exciting mix of eccentric characters such as La Maga who tugs at your heart strings most especially with the passing of her baby Rocamadour. The book can be read in different orders which makes the plot less important and the company of the characters most compelling. You will want to read this book over again at different stages in life--the way you might revisit old friends in another city. This faithful translation by Rebassa brings the Spanish original to life. A real beauty.
4,"BG fans, unite around this one","This is a fine collection of some of Goldberg's best from his 70-71 period. If you don't want to pay the high price for Two Jews Blues, or Reunion, this should satisfy.Jimi the Fox and I Think I'm Gonna Cry are here, along with the spectacular Blues for Barry and ... (and ... plays a great Mike Bloomfield guitar solo.And if you like Booker T. and the MGs, here's the jewish version: fine organ licks with a tasty band playing instrumental versions of hit songs. Highly recommended for Barry Goldberg fans. And do I hear some Charlie Musselwhite and Harvey Mandel?"
5,Study in Sisu: A Very Different Perspective on Europe 1900 - 1955,"What a window on a completely under-reported aspect of European history up to, through, and directly following WWII. I don't think you have to be Finnish to appreciate this little gem that my Dad wrote. I read it for Scandinavian History class way back when and, knowing all his prejudices, I still had to conclude he made an air-tight case regarding the Soviet power over Finland and its abuses. As it happens, my Finnish history teacher agreed whole-heartedly and was very pleasantly surprised to discover I was Austin Goodrich's daughter. Definite moment of pride, that was. It's not easy to set out to read your father's work and review it as a class paper. But worthwhile. The book is out of print, but if you can get one of these used ones you will be the richer for it. (No money in it for Dad of me -- all his royalties went to aid the Estonian, Latvian and Lithuanian refugees from Stalin!)"
5,Great Conditioner,"I first tried this product from Sephora. I've tried Fekkai products before but this one is truly special. It honestly leaves your hair soft and well conditioned. Only a small amount goes right thru your hair. Its not like other conditioners that you really have to work thru. This stuff is really great. I actually use it everyday to protect my hair from blow drying and my hair is never greasy just nice, conditioned, healthy and shiny."
5,Wow,"This stuff is fantastic. I have colored my hair with sun-in since I was 16 (I'm 23) and my hair is pretty dry and damaged. I was hesitant because of the price,but got it anyways because the reviews were so good. Those reviews did not lie, this product is amazing. I have only used it once but after leaving it on for 15-20 minutes I was easily able to run my fingers through my hair while rinsing it out (which is RARELY the case with any other conditioner or product) and afterwards my hair was shiny and frizz/flyaway free. I have been reluctant to use it again because I went through probably 1/3 of the jar or maybe even half while coating my hair. I will use it prior to special events or maybe just apply it on the most damaged areas. I will highly recommend this product and wish that it was available in gallon sizes because I wouldn't mind paying 40 or 50 for a large tub of this stuff. Also, I did not find the smell unpleasant at all;I think it smells really good."
2,ell,"I'm not impressed by this product. I've tried it twice now and both times my hair was sticky and it did not control the frizz. The next day my hair was a little softer and less sticky. I don't wash my hair everyday. All in all, will not purchase again."
2,Its ok,Ive been using it a week and a half now and it doesnt really feel any different than something like Aussie 3 minute miracle. Not worth the price. As for the seller shipment was received in a timely manner!
5,Hair Treament mask,"I received a very bad perm & my hair was fried! The salon refunded my money & gave only one treatment! So researched & found Fekkai hair mask, the best stuff on earth! In combination with macadamian oil my hair is almost healthy! Using it 3X per week for 2monthes. Still have 1/4 of jar left, well worth the money!"
4,Good stuff!!,"It is a good product. You only have to use once in a while. Doesnt weigh down my hair. I do a lot to my hair, coloring etc. so gets brittle. I have to have change pretty often. Works well during the winter as we have a wood burning stove, and tends to get very dry in our home even if we use a humidifier. The cost is a bit high, but for using it sparingly I guess its ok. It is worth it."
3,Not all it's hyped up to be,"This goop is nice and smells good but I have a Loreal treatment in a similar jar that is a fraction of the price and makes my hair feel just as smooth. So if you want to spend a pretty penny on a hair treatment, you could get this Fekkai one. If you want to save some money and get equivalent results, go to the drugstore and get L'Oreal Paris EverStrong Deep Replenishing Masque in the green jar."
5,The Best Leave-In Conditioner Ever,"I have long hair and this is the best deep conditioner treatment out there that I've tried. It makes your hair very shiny. When I use this I get compliments on my hair (from women, lol!, so you know it works.)"
4,Larger than Life,"They were quite a bit larger than I expected, I don't recall if they listed a size on the page. But I am 100% pleased with the many other purchases I've made with Silver Insanity."
1,Not Great,"I was quite disappointed with these earrings. They stick out too far from my ear lobes and the posts are flimsy and bend way too easily. Also, the stones do not even begin to resemble each other - it doesn't exactly look like a pair. You get what you pay for."
5,sparkles,These are very pretty but I did not relize how big they really were. I bought them for my kids and they are to big for them to wear. They are better for and adult size ear.
5,LOVELY MOONSTONE EARRINGS!,MY EARRINGS ARRIVED TODAY! THEY MATCH VERY WELL...THEY ARE A NICE SIZE AND THE COLOR IS GORGEOUS! YOU CAN'T GO WRONG WITH THESE IF YOU LOVE MOONSTONES!
3,View size before you buy,I didn't at all expect them to be the size they were - they are huge! I don't think they look normal on any ear. The moonstone is quite gorgeous though!
4,fast good service,My earrings shipped fast and look beautiful! The post on one is a little bent but it still works just fine. The stones are also a beautiful clear color.
2,Not very pretty,"These earrings are a rather dull gray-white color, and not very interesting to look at. They did fine with the backs that came with the earrings, so no special backs are needed."
3,Outlet Tool Supply - HORRIBLE Customer Service,"The pad is just fine but our company will NEVER buy anything again from outlet tool supply. If you have a problem and call them (which one of our people did) their response is ""what do you want me to do?"") in a crass smart-ass tone."
4,better than before,"I notice a definite improvement in comfort; less strain, though not perfect. I can play a bit better. My teacher says,""as long as you can play better, it's the right decision"""
4,A true story of an insane man loose in Brittish Columbia,"If you have read Jon Krakauers ""Into The Wild"" you should read this book. It is the true account of a mad man who lived alone in the wilderness of B.C. and his eventual demise."
5,"It is a must, for those who are interested in the Ascended Masters","I have been reading solely channellings for the past six year and this book is one of the best. Deep, yet simple and practical. Don't miss it."
4,great beginner shoes,bought these for christmas for myself and absolutly love them super easy to get in and out of and they support me 185 lbs as well as a 25 pound pack .
2,These don't last,I'm so tired of replacing these tires every 2ooo miles or so. I am out of the Dunlop business. Kenda probably has better longevity. They ride good but geeze. I wouldn't recommend these. I have to replace almost every year and I really don't ride that much
4,"Good, not great","These bags are wonderful for cleaning out large quantities of stuff, however they aren't as puncture resistant as the ads would have you believe. A couple cardboard box corners went through them like nothing. Still, as long as I remember these aren't the industrial construction site bags my contractor friend uses, I'm cool."
1,Looks are decieving,"After my longtime running and loyal SONY (best brand!) I had to get something new. I went with this because of it's unique style, price, and fare (so I thought) brand. However it last less than 3 months. You had to angle the player in order to get CD's to work. The antenna didn't last. The door on the cassette broke and prior to that ate cassette tapes. It also promised to play CD-R's and did not. This looked very unique and `cool`, however DO NOT let looks decieve you my fellow shoppers. The particular product I would not recommed to anyone. Or any Memorex products, as the customer service was not any help in this matter and were rather rude."
2,Slight Disappointment,"Though these fit well, I was very unhappy to find that only one pair has the design I wanted. The other are just plain white. Probably won't buy more."
5,Very complete work on the Pythagorean system,"Great book. Numerology is something that requires lots studying if you really want to master the art. This is definitely one to have, specially if you're getting only one. You won't regret it."
4,shadow code,"i got this game in january, i thought it was alright and interest but what i dont get is when you go to the creature world you only duel once then the credits comes up wats after that can someone help pzz tell how to get to creature world again"
5,perfect,I had an older one that this replaced and I love it just as much as i have loved my other one. shipping was quick. thanks again
2,"Lots of Drinks, but Nothing Modern","This book is filled with different drinks, but it seems none of them are made today (in the USA, at least) I recommend buying another book if you plan on being a bartender or serving drinks at home. If bizarre cocktails from the 20s are what your looking for, then buy this book."
3,good for a second drink mixing book on the shelf,"entirely old fashioned drinks, many you may have never heard of before. since old fashioned drinks have become trendy lately, more of these recipies are popping up on hip specialty drink lists of lounge bars. don't expect to use any of the latest schnapps with these drinks, and many of them include natural ingredients for flavoring.be sure to have a modern bartending book for pleasing the crowd, but this should be for secret specialties from years gone by."
2,NOT a complete world bartender guide,"I purchased this book mainly for a wider array of recipes, however, I was a bit disappointed with its contents. Although it has more than 2,400 drinks included, it boasts more old-fashioned type of drink, it did not even include a White Russian! Also, some of the recipes I did not agree with because they have evolved over time. I would not recommend it as a ready-reference for bar personnel since it is too out-dated for today's drinking crowd."
4,Good reference,Good reference. We have neapolitan mastiffs and this book doesn't really have information specific to different types of mastiffs.
3,Mastiffs (Complete Pet Owner's Manual),We are a kennel and give this book to all our Mastiff new puppy parents. It is a comprehensive book with information needed for new dog owners.
1,Superficially skunked,"I suspect this is the book available in a pet store; ninety per cent of it could be written for almost any breed of dog. Didn't read carefully, and guess you could say I got superficially skunked. I wouldn't reccommend this book to my dog for chewing, even.pat chapin"
5,Beautiful and full of mad ideas,"This early 2000s saw the debut of Grant Morrison's ""zen-facist"" hero Marvel Boy. Marvel Boy is a Kree explorer from an alternate reality. After his ship is destroyed his crew killed, and he is almost dissected he vows revenge on the Earth. He starts by carving the words 'F-You' 5 blocks tall in New York City.The bulk of the action is Marvel Boy's battle with Midas, a multi-trillionaire whose ""dreams is to plunder the radiant treasure houses of heaven itself one day"". Crazy ideas abound like sentient corporations, multiple personality AIs and a love interest named for a medieval torture device.The end promises Marvel Boy 2:001, a sequel that never happened. But even so the book is worth reading and even the ending feels right.JG Jones' art deserves special praise here, he can do anything from a city street to an interdimensional limbo and make it look perfect."
2,harder than described,i dont consider this a beginner series ... very little is explained with regard to breathing ... poses ... more difficult than expected
5,This was a hit!,Tara Stiles This Is Yoga: 4DVD set Complete Yoga Encyclopedia was a requested Christmas present for my youngest daughter. She told me she really loves doing the workouts. I would recommend this product.
5,Great Product,Highly recommend. My wife and i are enjoying the tape. Great for beginners and intermediate users. Very relaxing before bedtime.
3,Very beginner,"These DVD's are the perfect addition to any beginner's yoga practice. I gave this product 3 stars because I found it to be very beginner. I enjoy Tara's style of teaching, her voice is calming and her prompts are great. I only wish there was a bit more to each practice. Although the price of these DVD's was unbeatable, I also felt that the 5 minute practices were a bit of a rip off."
1,This is not Yoga,"Do not buy this DVD set if you like a traditional yoga approach. She is billed as a ""Yoga Rebel"" and I now understand why. As an instructor, I find Tara Stiles cold, detached and not spiritual by any means. She does not give clear descriptions of the asanas and the pace she sets is too fast. It felt like a gym aerobic class. Yes, twenty dollars for four CD's sounds like a good deal, but it wasn't. A waste of money."
2,Let down,"I was really excited to have new yoga material, as my routine had gotten stale- and the reviews sounded really promising. Unfortunately, she speaks WAY too fast, a little too much, and just zips through the poses. The narration is off- she's telling you to take your time, relax into it, breathe a lot- while on screen she's already moved into the next pose- so she has to quickly catch up in her narration. I am in no way a traditionalist so I don't take issue with the approach- I just find it irritating and don't get how it's supposed to be for beginners. It's just too speedy a form of yoga for my taste (and that's saying something because my regular kundalini is by no means slow)- and now I unfortunately have 4 of these discs."
4,Very intense,"Tara is realy a true yoga master. I would have given her a 5 stars except that she talks too fast and do not pause between sequences. Still, I will recomment to others."
5,Funnel,Their is not much to say. They do what they are supposed to do. I use them every week in my garage.
5,true artist,"this material is not mainstream.it is sang and played from the heart of a true to one-self obscure american artist.no slick production work in this material,just good music and lyrics."
3,Like a hippy flashback man,"This CD is a hippy flashback that still is fun to hear for the song the Legend of the U.S.S. Titanic. However I sadly find that the reverence to jews wife swapping offends people. I don't think that it was ment to be a slur but I do plan to burn a Cd with it edited out. I would not want to make any one feel that I was trying to degrade them. Any nationality should have that respect.The other fun song to hear is Talkin' Green Beret New Super Yellow Hydraulic Banana Teeny Bopper Blue. This song pokes fun at a politician and if you find that offends that's to bad, but as Americans it is almost a sacred trust to poke fun at any politician.All of the other songs are like folk songs man. And though I find I like the guitar in them I still find them hard to listen to."
4,Thanks for the memories,"Great album, Heard The Titanic back in the 70's on KAAA Little Rock Ark.When Stationed in LA. Grat stuff !!!"
4,Good review for boards,"I found this book to be pretty good review for Part III. It helped with summarizing all the stuff I learned in chiropractic school. It gave good reviews of the clinical impression or diagnosis, physical examination, neuro examination, etc. I also used the following which was just awesome for showing me the type of questions to be prepared for on the Part III and Part IV chiropractic Boards:National Board of Chiropractic Part III Study Guide: Key Review Questions and Answers with Explanations by Patrick LeonardiNational Board of Chiropractic Part IV Study Guide: Key Review Questions and Answers (Volume 1) and (Volume 2) by Patrick Leonardi.In fact, Dr. Patrick Leonardi's and Dr. Jeannette Gibson's study guides helped me to pass the boards. I advise getting these four study guides. It's better than taking these boards over again."
4,"Shimano UN26 - smooth action, plastic part","I bought this bottom bracket as a replacement for original equipment on a Diamondback mountain bike. I noticed that despite my effort to match the dimensions, the bottom bracket wouldn't thread fully into the bike but I don't fault the product for that and in any case functionally it works just fine.The action of the bottom bracket is very smooth. The plastic cup included with the product got a bit beat up as I tried to install it, so I ended up keeping the original metal cup from the original equipment bottom bracket. I would have preferred a metal cup.Overall, based on the Shimano brand and reasonable price, I would purchase the item again and so far it is performing well."
4,"Very good cartridge, very reasonable price.","Bottom brackets shouldn't just break. Mine did.According to the instructions on my bike, the bottom bracket was a Shimano. But when I pulled it, it was a different brand. Maybe that's why it broke?The Shimano BB-UN26 is a pretty common cartridge on bikes. This one has a hard plastic locking ring/sleeve, which is my only complaint. Having said that, the plastic might allow for easier replacement on threads that are rusted or damaged. Just pay close attention to the instructions, because you do not want to add a petroleum product onto a plastic locking ring.Pay attention to the direction of the threads!If you have a torque wrench, use it. This is the 3rd time I've been able to use mine, and it felt good to know that I was torquing the bracket to the correct tightness.Best of luck."
3,only one nut included,"Product was what was expected, and shipment was fast.There was only one nut included though - not sure why, I've got two pedals and two legs.It either should be two nuts or no nuts at all.The description doesn't say that no nuts provided though, does it?So I had to go to LBS and buy the nuts, could as well buy the BB there as well and not bother with Amazon and Niagara Works."
1,Missing plastic cup - had to return this item,"The picture of the Shimano BB UN26 clearly shows the plastic threaded cup at one end. However, this was missing, so I am having to return this item. I would like to ask the seller if they can replace it with the complete product as advertised, however, Amazon only seems to have the option to return it or replace it. With no way (that is evident to me) to ask the seller for clarification, I am giving up and going elsewhere.I am not giving up on Amazon altogether, I feel that the part may have fallen out of the box before they packed it, as the internal packaging was flimsy/partly open. None of he other reviews that I read has this issue.I have emailed 2 other websites that I have found to be reliable for bike parts (loosescrews dot com and ebikestop dot com) and both have actual humans (!) that have replied the BB UN26 does indeed come with the plastic cup as pictured. So I shall buy from one of them, or from a local bike store."
2,plastic not aluminum,"i bought this because it said ""Shimano UN26 bottom bracket now features a aluminum left hand cup instead of plastic.""it's still plastic! product is yet to be installed."
2,Not very durable,"Have been using the periwinkle bag for ~17 months now and it's totally unusable. I wash w/ my baby's cloth diapers, and it would usually turn inside out in the wash. The dry cycle made the thin plastic waterproof line start to come lose. It slowly got worse, with each wash/dry cycle. And now it's totally off, so just not a usable laundry bag (I used this bag as a hanging laundry bag, not a pail liner). I also have the green bag and the liner seems more durable, more secure. No problems in the dry cycle. Will not be buying another of these; some cloth diaper friends recommend Planetwise. Can't cinch this bag shut well enough to keep smells coming out to a minimum."
3,"Works fine, but doesn't hold odor in very well.",Satisfied with this product overall. I keep it in the laundry closet. I wash diapers every 2nd day and on wash day the odor leakage from the bag is overwhelming.
4,"Nice wet bag, but a little expensive....","I've had this bag for almost a year, and it's been washed every 2-3 days during that whole time. It has held up in the lengthy, hot washes very well! I always line dry it, so that may help too. I like the drawstring top, but only use it when I'm traveling. I found that leaving the top open and exposing the diapers to air cuts WAY down on the ammonia build-up. This bag fits perfectly in a 13-gallon trash can.The only drawback is the price -- there are other decent wet bags out there that oost less. I'm not sure the drawstring top is important enough to make up the difference."
1,"Smelly, and damp","This bag is a thin material that is very much the same as the outside covers of my bumgenius - I keep it inside my diaper pail, and at first used it like I would a garbage bag like shown in the pic - folded over the pail - so I could drop dirty diapers in through my diaper pail lid. Because my poor little girl's room smelled like pee so bad the next morning, I started pulling the draw string and stuffing the bag in the pail to try and keep the smell in, but that is not working either. It has felt a bit damp to me as well. I have a small wet happened bag I travel with that does a great job, so I think that I will look for something larger like that. For now, I spray lysol in and on the pail every morning to try and keep the smell at bay a bit. I would not suggest this bag for cloth diapers."
2,Not water resistant enough,"I wash my diapers every two days - along with the bag. However, when I picked this up to wash it, it was very wet on the bottom. I think I'll look for something a little more water resistant."
3,Taggie Ball,"I recently purchased the Taggie Pillow and Taggie Ball because my daughter loves the tags on everything. I was expecting the tags all over to be like the tags on her toys...but they are not. They are mostly made out of ribbon, which she didn't like. If the makers of ""Taggie"" would have put their brand named tages all over the ball, it would have been better for her and better advertising for them. Just a suggestion..."
2,Not much of a diaper bag,"The toy is fine for a toddler. However, I thought I was buying a sturdy doll diaper bag for a 7-year-old. The bag is a very thin, small, flimsy thing with a few items to go in it. It was all much smaller and much flimsier than I thought it would be. Definitely not worth the price."
3,Nice for Little Hands,"This bag was part of a birthday gift (with doll and stroller) for my 2-year-0ld granddaughter. She really enjoys playing with the items. There are 2 problems: first, the cap on the jar of baby food fits very tight and neither the 2-year-old or her 5-year-old sister were able to take it off or replace it; second, the bag is constructed of very thin cotton material with no support at all which make it difficult for small hands to manipulate."
2,MUCH better out there...............,"If you want to know the mechanics of your body and how it integrates(or doesn't integrate food), there are much better and informative books out there. One really great one: YOU On a Diet by Mehmet Oz, MD. It also is easy to read, understand and has a sense of humor.This book is VAGUELY informative and chock full of very un-funny humor.I just think one could do much better."
2,Can't say I didn't try,"I bought this to go around the tree last month and was very excited. The train set up easily but I noticed that the whistle button on the transformer was stuck down. It would either continue blowing or wouldn't blow. I called amazon and they sent another one out immediately. This second one also had messed up transformer buttons. This time I called Lionel. They seemed to be familiar with the problem and sent me another transformer to exchange. This transformer eventually arrived but also had a messed up button. But it seemed to work better than the previous ones. I set up the train and then noticed that the engine wouldn't work as easily on the track as the very first one that I set up. So after several weeks, three, transformers, and two trains, I decided to just send it back and get a refund. By this time Christmas was already past.I thought that I might want to take this up as a hobby but not anymore. Oh well.I will say that Amazons service was excellent as usual."
3,Great Train but arrived broken!,"The train is visually impressive and the kids just loved it. If everything works out of the box, you will be satisfied, if not, the problem is likely with you. It' hard not to like this train. Unfortunately the transformer bell did not work and that was dissapointing to say the least. I don't want to send the whole thing back as I'm afraid we won't have it back in time for X-mas. Amazon's return policy regarding broken pieces as oppossed to sending the entire package back is not user friendly. I'll try to work on just getting a new transformer. My rating is colored by the transformer. You may have better luck."
4,"I like it, but disappointed","I bought this to go with my Christmas village, not as a main train set. I read the reviews in advance and because there were so many positives, I went with this one. Now that it's up and running I have to agree with a previous reviewer's NEGATIVE points ... It doesn't smoke. We got it to work once but it was very faint, now it doesn't work at all. It would be a great bonus, but it wasn't the main selling point, so I'll live with it. I do, however, wish the whistle was louder; That too is very faint. Sometimes the train stops for no apparent reason in mid run, if I adjust things it starts again, but why does it do that?POSITIVES: I like how it looks with my village."
4,great toy... very bulky,"I like this toy. It is really like the movie with all the characters, and offers great features (the sounds, mobility,the hiding roof) and accessories (the panoramic background). You have to take into consideration, though, that it is really for kids 6 and up and it is very bulky. Those of you who are in small apartments (like in my case) or do not have an area where you can build it and leave it there for a while, will end up not using it too much. I bought it for christmas, I had it in the living room until foot traffic ended up disassembling it... and never again. It is now in one of the toy boxes of my kid (7) who takes it out in pieces and plays with it in pieces."
4,Polar Express,Just as expected an awesome train to put under the tree or to add to your collection . The Berkshire engine is very nice and heavy. The only Con I can think of would be the little whistle on top of the engine can break off easy . Other than that this is a nice Train you'll enjoy it .
1,Terrible product - - DO NOT BUY!,"This train was to be the star Christmas gift for by boys....it did not run. The steam engine was lifeless. After hours consolation, frustration and investigation I had it replaced. The second one ran for about a 1/2 hour....then nothing. We replaced it for the THIRD TIME and it did not work either! I see that others have had this problem too. Stay away from Lionel!"
5,Excellent quality train,A really good purchase. The locomotive is heavy and very realistic. The whole set works like a dream and my five year old loves it.
1,No Go,Unfortunately we had no luck with this train. Transformer starting blinking( indicating overload) immediately. Couple of false starts then nothing. Called the Lionel company for advice and tried a few things... got only a few sparks under the first engine then nothing :( Had to send back.
3,Polar Express,"Word of caution, you are better off buying from a Lionel Dealer with a 1 year Warranty through an authorized Dealer. The one I bought on Amazon failed in less than 4 months...guess what? Amazon is a 3rd party, no warranty past 3 months. Went to a Dealer who solved my problems with a new train set... don.t save a few bucks here buy form a real train dealer,"
5,The best,This Train reminded me so much of my original train my Mom bought for me in 1967. Quality is great and the cast iron engine is awesome.
3,Lionel Polar Express O gauge,"This train worked well right out of the box. The ""Santas bell"" in the description is a jingle bell ornament not a train bell. There is a plastic railing that attaches to the last car that won't stay on. I bought 4 extra staight track peices so the train could go around the tree rather than under it. I found out that there is another tender car that is available that has real train sounds such as chugging, a conductor announcment, bell, whistle etc..that can be controlled with the transformer/controller thacomes with this train. The problem is that it costs another $100 and replaces the tender car that comes with this train set.Overall this train is sufficient but it seems pricey for what you get."
3,Not your father's Lionel.,"We purchased this train for our grandchildren. They were thrilled. However, like everything manufactured today, the quality is just not there. The plastic pieces do not fit very well. The engine doesn't smoke like they used to. And, finally, there is no on-off switch on the transformer. Wish I still had my old Lionel to pass on. On a positive note, the train arrived from Amazon sooner than expected and was packaged very well."
5,Lionel O Gauge Train,So far so good with our train. My 4 year old loves watching the train. The track was very long. We were expecting a small circle but we actually had enough To make a large oval track. The only problem is the train goes very fast and we need to build a table with sides to make sure the train doesn't hit the ground. We can only go about 30% on the dining room table. We love our train and look forward to purchasing more Lionel products.
2,Broke first day,"Wonderfully constructed train set. Our whistle didn't work from the start. Then after running for about 20 minutes under the Christmas tree the locomotive started to make a grinding noise. It then stopped going around the track all together. Just enough time to get our three young boys all excited about our new train set then we had to sit there and pack it all up in front of them. Very sad!! We got a great deal on the train set but now it's selling for over a $100 more than what we paid for it. So if we want another one we have to spend even more money! Hopefully the return will go smoothly and we'll get our money back in a timely manner. First return made to Amazon, so I'll post something later if we have any problems."
3,"Not Bad, Average Quality and Short Track","The quality of the pieces other than the engine are very ""plasticky."" I suppose it's too much to ask for the whole thing to be metal like the old days, but the plastic really does feel kind of cheap. Still, it looks good and the transformer is solid as a rock. It's temperamental, though, and the wheels all need to be aligned just right for it to work. I bet that's why some people report the flashing light problem, just a small misplacement will keep the train from moving. The other notable thing about this product is the relatively short track. I would think that the track would be much cheaper to make than the trains, but the overall length of the track is quite short (maybe 12-15"" in total, with four curves)."
2,Will let you know when we can get it to stay on the tracks.....,The train will not stay on the stracks for even one time around. With all cars or none. What a pain and disappointment thus far.
1,WORKMANSHIP VERY POOR QUALITY. CHINA MADE IS BAD,"every loco in these sets were damaged, paint chips on loco's. parts missing. called lionel directly to voice complaint.These sets made in CHINA. Very poor quality, . Until proven wrong, will never buy CHINA made LIONEL POLAR EXPRESS train sets again. Passenger cars in these sets also VERY POORLY MADE. Steps at bottom of door on each end SEPARATED from its main cabin. VERY POORLY ASSEMBLED .. MUCH IMPROVEMENT IS NECESARY HERE"
2,Cheaply made for the money,"Husband ordered this for kids for Christmas. Amazon had a fair price on it, but the Lionel quality was sorely lacking. The observation platform would NOT attach to the back of the final car. The adults tried very patiently for a couple of hours and never got it on. After so many attempts, one of the plastic attachments disappeared. It must have fallen off, but we never even saw it happen. Also the plastic whistle on top of the engine fell off after I simply touched it. Hugely disappointed. We were hoping this would start a family tradition and we could add to the set each year. Instead, I sent it back. Hope we can find a better quality replacement for a good price next year."
5,choo choo,"beautiful! family loves it and looking forward to adding to it each year. your 3 y/o really likes it, alot!"
4,Polar Express O Gage,"My son loves trains, and loves the Polar Express we got him for his birthday. This train is durable and realistic looking. There is enough tracks to make a good size oval, I wish it would have came with more tracks to make a bigger course. Amazon had the best price after shopping around."
1,Terrible Experience,I bought this kit for my 7 year old son. On Christmas morning it ran for about 1/2 hour before the transformer quit. We got a new transformer which worked for about 30 seconds before it also quit. I thought that Lionel was the gold standard in trains sets when I bought this. We'll be sending it back today. What a dissappointment!
1,TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE!!!,"We ordered this train for Christmas to set up under the tree. It arrived and looked great, we opened it Christmas morning with my son who was SO EXCITED. We set everything up and it all looked very nice (although the track seemed a bit short) but other than that we were thrilled. We connected everything correctly, by the book and followed the exact instructions then turned it on and NOTHING. It did not work at all. The transformer green light immediately started flashing and it never went anywhere. TERRIBLE PRODUCT. So disappointing on Christmas morning. It is being returned as we speak..."
2,Damaged,"The quality of Lionel train parts are not what they used to be. Upon opening the box, we discovered a severed drive-wheel rod and a busted seal on the transformer. We want to replace it for our disappointed son, but only refunds are available because it's out of stock. Very disappointing."
3,Good but definitely could be better.,"Enjoyed the Lionel Polar Express Train, but will have to tune up for next year. The tracks come apart too easily, the horn is no longer working. And we have been very careful with the grand kids running it. So two old people will fix it and hope it works for next year."
2,Transformer did not function,"The train itself and track are fine, but the transformer did not function. When we hooked it up, the transformer's light blinked green suggesting a power overload. It even blinked when we had it plugged in but not hooked up to the track. A quick bit of research on Christmas Eve suggested this is a very common problem with the Polar express c80 transformer. Lionel customer service has offered to replace it, but we must bear the cost of the return shipping on the defective transformer and the one they are shipping is coming UPS ground in 7-10 days. As this was a Christmas gift for my young son, this set, and Lionel's warranty, is very disappointing."
1,Not pleased,"I bought this train with my Christmas money, and it took a week to get here, but then it didn't work anyway. When it came, I opened the box, and turned it on, and I was surprised to see how great it worked, but after a few minutes it started acting funny. It wouldn't go forward anymore. The train was going around a corner, and stopped. I sent it back, and I am waiting for my replacement."
3,Polar Express doesn't smoke,Like it. Just wish the smoke would come out of the top. I was real careful not to overfill. The smoke switch is on. NOTHING. Seems the lights and smoke would be the two things that really sell the train. Too bad they don't both work...
3,Heads up,"First, the Christmas tree cardboard cut out featured in the picture above is not included in this set, there is no working bell on the train and the observer cars railing is very flimsy and falls off every use.Also, this set DOES NOT RUN WELL ON CARPET. Because this is an AC current set (DC or more stable) it will spark like crazy if put it on an uneven surface or if the track bows. Because the engine car is so heavy this will happen a lot if you try to set it up on carpet. Because of the sparking I did not want to put this under our live tree so had to find a new place for it.Finally, this set is very large and is not the smaller size train that I thought it was.Had I known all this before purchase i would have reconsidered."
2,a delayed surprise,My wife of over sixty years of marriage to me had expresses several times over the years since we were married in 1950 that she did not get a Lionel Train set when she was a kid and how disappointed she was Christmas after Christmas when she did not get a Lionel Train set for Christmas. It finaly doned on me that I could fulfill that childhood wish. I ordered the Lionel Trains Polar Express train set and when it came you should have seen her eyes light up as I set it up for her. She was like a kid again. We will not be around many more years but we have already promised our son that it will be his when we no longer need it. The train is wonderful. The details of the engine and cars are great. We sit and watch it with the room darkened and see all the lights in the cars and on the engine as it circles the track. Even I enjoy this finely crafted toy and we expect it to last several generations. Thank you for making it possible to surprise my wife after so many years!
3,smoke stack not working,The smoke stack on the engine will not work and there were no instructions on how to get help.I like the train. I just need help to fix the smoke stack.
3,A little disappointed....,"We bought this trainset to let it run around our tree this year. But sadly it is very loud. You can't let the train run and listen to music - the train make to much noise.The metal on metal (from the points of getting the power) noise is absolutely not relaxing and any try to get the train less noisy didn't work out.The idea is great, but that noise - sorry, I would not buy this again!"
1,Polar express O gauge electric train,"Ordered this grand train for my sons 5th Christmas! It was to be the biggest wow present to date. The box arrived, and it looked beautiful! Detailed, wrapped really well. By the time we got our platform ready to add track and scenery , it was just a few days to Christmas.. HOWEVER!!!! The train didn't work!! At all . Amazon returned our money, but we had race around to Hobby Stores at the very last minute to find a new one . Luckily, we found one, but at a much higher price. Very disappointed with spending a large sum of money at Amazon, that was completely DEAD."
1,crap,"the stupid trains don't stay together. After an hour and a half setting it up and installing batteries and what-not, my 6 year old son came down and the trains just wouldn't stay attached. We spent more time trying to hook up the trains and put them back on the track then watching the train go half-way around the track."
5,"Can we all say ""hype""?",The movie isn't out and I do believe we all are buying a 300 dollar toy which we don't even see a picture of. All I see here is a painting of a steam locamotive. Let's not buy into this. I mean sold out before the movie came out? Could this be on purpose to promote hype? Wouldn't 300 dollars buy your kid tap dancing lessons for a few years? Isn't that way cooler? Thanks for giving me my 2 cents.
4,every kid should have one,my grandson loved the train. easy to assemble and to operate. the back railing on the last car keeps coming off. i had to superglue it. for the price you would think it would stay on. the xmas bell was a cute extra touch (if u have seen the movie)
5,Polar express,"As one of the voluteers who is restoring the actual locomotive from the movie its about time i had my own to run on my layout. Since christmas is over i now have it pulling 20 freight cars. Only disappointment is the whistle in tender, takes alot of power to get it to whistle, and the model is more designed to the loco in the movie, not the real 1225, but since there are other 1225 models its ok to have the movie version."
5,Great train!,"Great train so far. I ordered for my son for Christmas because he loves the Polar Express. It is great so far. The only small complaint would be the rear platform falls off of the last passenger car a lot. You will need to glue it to keep it in place, especially if you run the train at faster speeds. That definitely should not keep you from purchasing this train. We look forward to expanding this set."
3,A little dissapointed,I received the Polar express train set as A christmas present and compaired to the Lionel train my wife bought me for Christmas the year before I was kind of dissapointed. The first set I had to return due to the smoke not working and the whistle was barely audible. The new one they sent works good but the smoke has since stopped working/puffs every now and again. I think its a shame you shell out almost $300 and things dont work like their supposed to. I understand sometimes things break but after reading all the reviews on here and alot of them are negative it makes you question lionels quality control.
5,Polar Express,"I bought this train set for my 6 yr. old grandson. He really loves the story and now he has his own ""Polar Express""!It is a very special toy and I hope he will be able to share it someday with his own children."
4,Polar Express train,The Polar express train has made my special grandson very happy and I appreciate the good service by Amazon. There is one problem with the bell not working and my attempts to talk to someone at Lionel have been unsuccessful. Can you help?
4,Happy 3 1/2 year old!,"Everything came as advertised. I still haven't been able to get the smoke feature to work, and a plastic piece keeps coming off the caboose - the back deck piece.Otherwise, a wonderful train set that we placed around the tree on Xmas Eve after watching Polar Express with our 3 1/2 year old son. The next morning he was beside himself."
4,Lionel Train Polar Express,We are thrilled with this train set. My son has been wishing for this for 3 years. When it arrived we were pleased with how fast it came. It is a beautiful train and runs well on the tracks. More tracks are definetly needed. The train sounds real and the smoke runs well too. We recomend this for a special gift. Any child would be glad to recieve.
2,Equipment dont work on christmas day,"I open the box and commence assebling the train, traks, and wires to transformer. Find out the transformer was bad, and the copany who makes it replace me with one wich arrive on January 3.."
5,special,this is a very special christmas train and it looks beautiful under the tree . add on cars make it all the more perfect .
4,"Toshiba 42HP66 42"" Plasma HDTV","Well packaged, easily set-up and wired.Well planned digital and analog connections in location and numberUniversal remote not compatible with my cable box is the only downside, but this is a short term thing. If there are questions, web site has list of all brands supported for review prior to purchase."
1,Goes black at less than two years,"After reading many reviews, we purchased this TV for $2400 on March 22, 2006. Yesterday, March 16, 2008, a loud popping noise and the TV goes black. We have sound, but no video. Toshiba says ""sorry."" Expert repair guy says probably will require major work and suggests we start looking at the new and improved and cheaper TVs out there now. It won't be a Toshiba."
5,Passed with 984,"I used this book together with the corresponding Training Guide, by the same authors (this was redundant because the two books essentially repeat each other - I could have just used the Training Guide.) I think these authors are amazing - they have ability to present everything in such an easy understandable way, that I didn't just memorize the stuff for the exam but actually understood it. Now my next one is 70-229 - SQL server exam, I wish Kalani had a book for that one as well..."
5,Super Trouper: ABBA's Masterpiece,"""Super Trouper"", released by ABBA in 1980, is regarded by many ABBA fans - including myself - as simply one of ABBA's best original albums. ""Super Trouper"" showed a more mature and personal ABBA, who at the time were at an emotional crossroad in their intertwined lives and careers; the songs ""The Winner Takes It All"" and ""Super Trouper"", beautifully written, are evident of this. Other noteworthy songs in this album are ""Our Last Summer"", ""Me And I"", ""Andante, Andante"" and ""The Way Old Friends Do"". For any first-time buyer of an ABBA album, while ""ABBA Gold"" or the 4 cd-box set ""Thank You For The Music"" is definitely a worthwhile investment of their greatest hits, the album ""Super Trouper"" provides a more intimate look and sound into one of the world's most successful music acts."
5,Inside Muffler Cutter Air Chisel,"Inside Muffler Cutter Air Chisel With no packaging or tips to use. Very poor packing from this seller, shipper open package to see if it was still in there."
1,messy and stinky,"I have used different types of bore cleaner over the years, usually non aerosol. I would not use this again it has ether in it and is stinky and it sprays so hard it shoots and splashes all over. And it doesn't work any better.Don't buy this product"
2,Disappointed,"I purchased this item because it seem to be an awesome way to cut down on carrying alot of different cords and connectors. Only thing is, the outlet part for the ac is defective. Other than that it's a good idea."
2,Disappointing,"This is like a history channel documentary, with deep narration trying for ""reclaiming"" drama. Some of it was interesting and I liked seeing all the different researchers and re-creators playing with swords, which they were very insistent on calling 'European Martial Arts' -- I guess in contrast to Asian martial arts. I try to avoid cultural stereotypes in any case.But my husband pointed out that in saying that The Blade was lost, they totally ignored all the cavalry sabers and rifle bayonets. I was also a bit miffed that this documentary didn't give enough credit to the SCA people who did a ton of original source research back in the early 1970s.The extended edition might be better, or it might just be longer, I can't tell.Reclaiming the Blade (2-disc Special Edition)"
4,Good and entertaining information regarding swords in modern day world,"The two disc edition of ""Reclaiming the blade"" expands on the original doccumentary by adding several hours worth of materials that, for one reason or other, did not made it into the movie itself or can be seen a supplementary material - videos of historical swordfighting techniques, additional material about Veta studios and such. Movie itself is a very good source of information for people who only have encountered swords in feature films and literature, as it dispells many myths that exist in our society regarding this ""nobliest of weapons"". Presented by famous movie stars and scientitsts, as well as enthusiasts recreating historical European martial arts, the storry is enticing and well presented. Both enthusiasts in this area and people without a great knowledge in this subject will find it entertaining and informative."
5,World Class Documentary!!!,"Whether your interest is in history, martial arts or the movies, this amazing documentary is for you. Reclaiming the Blade carefully chronicles the history of the sword and swordsmanship in the West and explains the ongoing fascination with the sword as evidenced by its presence in our culture, and especially our movies. Included in this feature length documentary are extensive interviews by the actors and props creators of Lord of the Rings, as well as extensive interviews with the legendary Bob Anderson, the Hollywood swordmaster who has instructed and choreographed the most famous sword fights in film history.GET THIS VIDEO! YOU WILL BE GLAD THAT YOU DID!!!"
5,A Pleasant Light Read,"Once Upon a Princess is a beginning of a trilogy. The first book stars Parker and Jace. A princess and the man paid by her father to spy on her. Parker hates being a princess and leaves her country to study in college in the U.S. The problem is she doesn't want to go back. Her father the King wants to know what is going on, so he sends Jace a local agent to spy on her. The more Jace gets to know Parker the more he falls in love with her. Could this relationship work after Parker finds out the truth? A lovely light read. The trilogy is then continued with Once Upon a Prince and then Once Upon a King. They are all great."
2,Not the best I've read,"I'm a BIG fan of Robert Charles Wilson books, and ordered this collection of short stories with great anticipation. After finishing the book, however, I must admit that I was somewhat disappointed. A couple of the stories are what I'd call good, the rest left me hoping that the next story would be better. RCW's stand alone novels are excellent and I'd recommend them to anyone, but I can't say that I'd recommend this collection."
4,Pyramid PMBHTW4 DJ 4-Way Tweeter Box,"It worked great for me. Im a dj and i constantly blow my tweeters in my speakers. When i hooked these up with my speakers, i was amazed how clear it made my speakers sound. Not to mention the price is right!!"
4,Nice for normal system,"Overall worth the price. Nice Tweeters for the price...no distortion even when forced low frequencies. Could be louder, but its good overall."
5,An interesting period perspective . . .,As might be expected this document focuses on the author's perspective of the railroad industry evolution in the United States from earliest times. It is an easy read and offers information that an average enthusiast likely will find of benefit if their interests are to learn about the transportation evolutions in the U.S.A. It is a bargain by any measure and it is my hope that more similar works will become available in the future. Thank you Amazon
5,Clothing patterns galore....,"If you are looking for a lot of clothing patterns this is the magazine for you. I am constantly amazed at how many patterns they fit into one issue and the quality of design. I have been crocheting for 32 years and the patterns in this magazine inspire me to keep at it.This is not your grandma's crochet. This is beautiful sweaters with wonderful drape, and modern design. They don't stop there...in addition to clothing I have also made some cute toys and beautiful afghans. The primary focus is on clothing, however, there is plenty to keep you happy for those times that you are not in the mood to do a wearable.In addition to the wonderful patterns there are articles and how to's that explore new techniques.Out of the past two issues I have made at least 4 projects from each one and have many more in my Ravelry queue."
2,Did not like this camcorder.,"You can do better for the money. The image quality is below average and low light is really bad, even for a novice camcorder. I'm glad to see the price has come down. The camcorder did not come with the software needed to capture video or even play the dvd on my computer(it really should have). I would do more research and choose a camera that is right for you. I found many online camcorder review sites very helpful. I returned it and bought another panasonic with 3ccd technology. It has much better picture quality. If you want really good night vision go with sony. I would not recomend this camcorder to anyone."
2,The SD Useability Misnomer,I'll be quick:Everyone else covered everything else about it so...Major drawback is that this palmcorder will not record motion video straight onto the SD Card at all; it only saves the still pictures (VDR-D200) taken by it onto the SD.What a major bummer and Panasonic should be 'spanked' for this one while charging the consumers a FORTUNE for it!I for one would prefer a USB palmcorder with SD backup option.This is a trick-camera for magician actors! BOOOOH!! >:P
1,Thorn in my side!,"This video camera was a gift from my mother-in-law. For 3 years I have been trying to decifer/troubleshoot how to make copies of the disks onto the computer and then to DVD's. I read the manual through and through, nothing. I called Panasonic and a non-English speaking man with bad reception walked me through some things. I was then told that software came with my camera in order to copy and make the DVD's. When I questioned this, I was then told that the software does NOT come with the camera and that it needs to be purchased seperatly. What a mess! Liars on top of confusion! PLEASE do not buy this thing! Buy anything else but THIS model!"
1,piece of junk,I absolutly HATE this camcorder! Couldnt upload my videos. and 3 years later the videos i recorded DO NOT work on anything but the stupid thing and i finalized the discs! ugh - dont waste your time or money!!!
1,I regret the purchase :(,I did a lot of research before purchasing this camera. I am very disappointed with it. I have had it for several years. The vdr-d100 model does not come with software (the vdr-d200 does come with software) I purchased the software seperately. It is a HUGE hassel to import the video to the computer and then to burn a DVD. I do digital editing with pictures and video so I am pretty good on the computer and I have such a difficult time getting the video imported. The picture quality is good and the camera is easy to use but I would not purchase this camera again.
3,High price and lack of directions hurt value,"Bar Harbor's New England Lobster Chowder is a condensed chowder with big chunks of potatoes and, if you look closely, bits of lobster. Now, I honestly did not expect a full lb of lobster meat in the can but I was a little surprised when I emptied the contents into my pot. Still, the chowder tasted very good. It's not nearly as good as homemade lobster chowder but it was better than a bowl of Campbell's New England Clam Chowder and served as a very adequate quick meal.I was a little disappointed at the vagueness of the directions. For $6/can they could have been more specific than add milk, butter, or cream to desired consistency. I found a bit of butter, splash of sherry, 1/4 cup of 2% milk, and 2 tbsp of cream worked very well. Also, it was better than the Campbell's but I don't know if it was necessarily six times the price better.It's definitely worth while to keep in the house for a quiet night when you're looking to make a quick but tasty meal."
1,Lobster? Chowder,Disappointed. Difficult to describe taste but it doesn't taste like lobster chowder should. Not worth the price. Will not order again.
1,Lobstah Chowdah,"I'm amazed at Buccaneer's 5-star rating...maybe it was better in 2009. Wouldn't be the first time quality has gone down as the years go by. I was very disappointed. I didn't expect a high-quality lobster bisque or chunks of lobster meat, but I did expect at least more potatoes and corn (I'd say barely 2 tablespoons). I'm not sure if those faint red spots were lobster meat or a spice. In any case, it was beyond bland. It probably could be improved (as others suggest) by using cream, butter, and a dollop of sherry. Which I'll do in the future--if someone gives me a can; I won't buy it again. We have the clam chowder as well...haven't tried that, but being forwarned, I'll be using cream, butter, AND another can of minced clams/juice! I suspect we'll be going back to Snow's."
3,Disco nights,"""Voule Vouz"" is probably Abba's most disco influenced album, which is not to say its bad because Abba was always first and formost a dance band. What the album really lacks is a killer single like ""Dancing Queen"" or ""Knowing Me, Knowing You"" to serve as a highlight. The best songs here, ""Chiqutita,"" ""Angel Eyes,"" ""As Good as New"" and ""I Have a Dream"" are all fine pop songs worthy of the Abba tradition. The title track, however, is a weak disco number, and ""Does Your Mother Know,"" with its borderline pedophilia lyrics, is a bit creepy. Overall, this album will not disappoint fans, but more casual listeners should start with one of the Greatest Hits packages."
2,Second rate video,"For some reasons, the actual video is much shorter than the 72 minutes printed on the cover. Furthermore, there are at least half a dozen more tracks that are not shown but again printed on the program.The performance is mediocre as far as Carreras is concerned. I think he is over his prime at the time this was filmed in 2001. Even thought it was fimed in Taomina, there is no visual shown of the beautiful town. The carmera work is pretty sad too. I would waste money on this unless it is for $5.00 or you are a die-hard fan!"
3,"Specific projects, not general instructions","This book is another in a string of books I have purchased hoping to find general information and instruction on painting furniture. Unfortunately, it details specific projects, but if you don't want to do those exact items, you don't get the directions you need."
3,Disappointing,"Amateur, cheap looking finishes. I was looking help with finishes that look like they came from Habersham or other great furniture makers."
2,Disappointing Victorinox offering,"Having owned Victorinox's wavy blade knives for many years, we ordered these and were very disappointed. Instead of the old wavy blade which cut great, the new one has micro-fine teeth that simply shreds a cut of meat. We ended up buying the Cuisinart Advantage steak knife set for even less money, and they have very sharp straight blades (the best to cut meat) and comfortable, riveted handles."
2,Victorinox By Forschner Steak Knife Set,"Up until now, I have always been delighted with all the Victorinox knives that I own. However, this set was a disappointment. Virtually all the Victorinox knives I have ever come across were sharp as a razor blade, serrated or straight edge. These steak knives, cut like knives in need of sharpening! The handle construction is first rate, but you don't cut with the handle!! Victorinox by Forshner is the maker of the famous ""Swiss Army Knives"" and their reputation alone has been enough of a reason to purchase their products. I will be more cautious in the future...."
1,Tentacles?,"I am trying to gain a balanced and objective understanding of Islam. This is not easy with all of the ignorance and prejudice that abounds these days, even among academics. I have several of the Rough Guides, so I thought I would check this one out.After reading the Introduction given above and coming across the phrase ""Islam spread its tentacles still further"" in one of the early paragraphs, I decided that I would pass on this Rough Guide. Talk about biased language from the get-go! Maybe you should pass on this title as well.Also, the endlessly rehashed innaccurate stereotype about Islam being a religion spread by the sword boggles my mind especially since the religion that best fits this description is Christianity--not Islam. Just think Crusades, Thrity Years War, and on and on."
1,Freedeom of speech does not cover libel.,"Of course, many people will probably be checking out this book and a big deal will probably be made of it being banned in Malaysia on the premise that it has been deemed ""prejudicial to public order under the Printing Presses and Publications Act of 1984"".What else would you expect? In even the introduction reproduced above, the book repeats the age-old orientalist claim that Islam was spread by the sword. Do you really expect this to go over well in Malaysia? The people there know quite well that this is false since they have many muslims there, yet a muslim army never invaded Southeast Asia-- The British, Spanish, and Dutch, yes, yes, and yes; the arabs, turks, and persians, no.Many of the book claims made are not even controversial, they are just factually incorrect and libelous. There are many better books available."
5,So far the best Photoshop book that I have seen,"I am a photographer and web designer, so I use photoshop on a regular basis. I have more than 10 photoshop books, and this one is by far the best. Most of the books deal with one side of the photoshop and not the other. This one takes you step by step, from setting up your preferences (I have yet to see a book, besides this one, which does this) to teaching you everything that you have to know about this great application. This is a must have for a photographer, and anybody who is interested in learning advanced Photoshop 6.0"
5,Superb practical coverage of digital imaging,"As someone who is probably guilty of buying every book available on photography and in particular digital photo-retouching & printing, I can't recommend this book highly enough!The sections on setting up Photoshop's color and print configurations were invaluable and the best I've seen. The sections on photo retouching and printing techniques were truely excellent also.This book rapidly gets you through setting up your environment with Barry's tips and proven settings and then takes you straight into using the product effectively."
3,Great content with minature type.,"This is by far one of the best Photoshop books that I have had the pleasure to try to read. The technical content is outstanding and illustrations very good which should rate it as a solid 5 star. However, what is the value of a book in which the type and illustrations are so small that it is nearly impossible to read which is the case for this book. I have 20/20 vision and found it impossible to read such small type for more than a page or 2 without developing eye strain. I did pass these comments on to the author to which he agreed. If you don't mind reading with a magnifing glass, buy this book."
3,O.K. as far as software books go.,I had gotten Barry haynes Photoshop 5 Artistry a few years ago and couldn't figure out why I never used it. After buying Photoshop 6 Artistry I now know why. He tends to be a bit arrogant in his writing; for example he seems try to make you feel like that if you don't do everthing his way you just aren't worthy to use photoshop. Secondly there are far too many inconsistencies in the book; he will reference a diagram or picture as being on the next page when in fact it is on that very same page or even the page before it. It looks to me as whoever did the proof reading of this book should be fired. Don't get me wrong it is a great book to learn advanced Photoshop techniques if you can get by the author's arrogance and the very obvious mistakes in the book. I would probably have given this book a higher rating if it weren't for all of proof reading errors and I only just started to work through the book
4,Working Backwards,"This book is an excellent tool for learning Japanese. I received my copy of the workbook before I received Japanese in Mangaland (some shipping problems, I guess) and I was able to work backwards from this to learn Japanese while waiting for its companion. Now that I have Japanese in Mangaland 1 as well, I realize just how necessary this workbook is to really cement the concepts taught in JiM, especially for those who don't have another outlet to practice Japanese."
3,"Okay in a pinch, but tastes fake, not natural.","These would be very good mints if the taste were more natural. They don't really taste like raspberry and they don't taste natural. Maybe some adjustments with the recipe would make these taste better. Still, they're better than most of the stuff you see at the checkout counter in the grocery store. I bought a big case of them so I'm using them slowly."
4,From Hollywood With Love,"This is a wonderful account of the early beginnings of a young, silent film actress. Since reading this autobiography, I've become more intrigued with Hollywood in the 1920's, and It's role in creating the whole flapper lifestyle and dress. I loved it! Bessie Love is a fascinating person to read about."
2,Sent wrong book,"I ordered the 1981 edition of Engineering Electromagnetics, and recieved the 1958(!) extremely dated version. I recommend that anyone BE SURE TO SPECIFY the edition they would like. The latest edition in print was (I believe) 1981.I am attempting to return this book now."
1,Not advertised correctly,The poster was advertised to be 24x36 but was only 24x33. I had purchase frames for it to fit and thus made them unusefull.
5,Loved this book!,"I love the humorous adoring way this author describes her horrendous experience in caring for her elderly parents. I could see myself so many times, especially when dealing with the health care system! It made me laugh hysterically and also tear up. This book is a must for anyone dealing with aging parents. If you are in the middle, or beginning of your experience it offers strong reassurance that you are not alone. If you think you are going crazy, it gives you the sanity that you didn't think you had. It offers helpful tips, especially when a parent is suffering from dementia, which so common and often goes unrecognized. So engaging, I couldn't put it down!"
5,Best book I've ever read on difficult elder parents.,"This is the best book I have ever read on coping with difficult elders. I have read it at least 4 times since it being recommended to me in 2006. It is not some boring book on ""how to"" that you have to make yourself read, I literally could not put it down. It is funny, well written and makes you feel like Jackie is talking about your parent! Would highly recommend it to anyone facing difficulty in dealing with an elder."
5,A Must Read for Anyone with Aging Parents,"Elder Rage is such a valuable book for anyone who is caregiving for aging parents. It's very hard for some people to understand the stressful dynamics between elder parents and their caregiving children until they've been in the situation, which can be incredibly challenging.Thankfully, Jacqueline Marcell has written an enjoyable, valuable resource for caregivers to learn specifics for managing even the most difficult elder and challenging eldercare situations. And since it is written with so much LOL humor, it makes learning easier, more memorable, and solvable.-Nicole Jewell, SharpSeniors.com"
5,Couldn't put it down....,"This book was so helpful to me. Number one, I was just relieved to read that Jacqueline was going through many of the same things that I was. Often, you feel alone and as if no one understands how bad it can be. She offers many tips and suggestions that she found out on her own that I would not have thought of. Anyone who has a loved one going through dementia or Alzheimer's should read this book. This is the hardest thing I have ever had to go through and this book offered me humor, hope, and understanding."
5,Elder rage,"i found this book to be very helpful with caring for elderly. it was written with much insight, humbor, and i cried and laughed my way through it"
5,A Trip into the Dementia Zone,"As I read this book I was captivated! This could be my dad Jacqueline Marcell was writing about. The book made me feel like I wasn't dealing with the unknown, and had a LOT of insight and helpful hints to direct me to where I needed to go to get my dad the help he needs. Plus I feel that as time goes on, many many people will get the bennifit from this book. I hope, pray, beg and plead with professionals to READ THIS BOOK. Sometimes the doctors DON'T know everything about the situation, and they need to listen to family memebers that are having to deal with it. With better understanding the persons affected can get better care. Kudos for Jacqueline Marcell for sharing her personal experience with the rest us AND giving us the hope we need in a seemingly hopeless situation."
5,I laughed till I cried,"never have much time to read until my sister told me about this book, since we are four sisters going thru this with our parents..my father is 104 and my mother 87..she is the one with dementia..feel bad for my dad that has to put up with her mood swings, but this book has made us realize we are not alone...so many funny things that happened to jacqueline and heartbreaking at the same time..we can certainly identify...It helped me to realize that I need more patience with my mom and as long as she's alive, I will do and say things to make her happy..it is so sad to see someone who used to be full of energy and loved to sing and dance and look her best when going out, just sit and wither away, has lost interest in so many things..we will not put our parents in a home..they live in a mobil home now, which to them is their castle...this is where they want to be till the end...god give us the strenght to carry on...thank you jacqueline, you have been a godsend...Emily Andert"
5,Must Read! For All With Elders,"Having received this book as a gift from my aging mother, I read it immediately. I cohabitated with my parents for some twenty years. I was the one responsible for both in their declining years/months/days. I couldn't have maintained my sanity without the information from the book ""Elder Rage"". It contains a wealth of information and I am not one who likes to read. The book is easy to read and how I would have loved the Audio Version.Mandatory Read/Listen"
5,Great Book for all,"This book should be required reading for all. Medical professionals especially should read this book. Ms. Marcell's descriptive and vivid experiences with caregiving for her parents is a testament to strength and persistence. The tips she provides will save countless hours for others caring for their parents. By sharing the intimate details of her experience, Ms. Marcell's story gives her readers insight into what eldercare challenges are and real life resolutions."
5,My experience,"This book was very enlighting even thou it seemed extreme, but I can see how it can happen. I can see someof the same characteristics in my husband and potentially some of the same behaviors. At this time he hasmood swings from nice to nasty for no apparent reason. Also there is no reasoning with him. He is incomplete denial and something is wrong with me. He is starting to be at a loss for words which is veryfrustrating to him, but blames me for not knowing what he is saying. I see where it is very important thatI take care of myself so as not to get sick, because this 24/7 care giving is very stressful most days,Fortunately, my family is supportive and when I get a few hours to do something outside, it is like a breath offresh air.I am glad that I read Elder Rage for all it's insights."
5,TIMELESS TOPIC,"HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TIMELESS TOPIC!As president of the Parkinson's Resource Organization, I have recommended Jacqueline's riveting book to numerous types of people. If you are a caregiver, you will learn valuable lessons while being comforted and feeling less alone. If you are shocked that your once competent loved one is no longer who they used to be and you worry that caregiving is coming your way, you will receive insight and understanding. If you are a, now known as ""caredfor,"" you will realize what your care providers, caregivers, are going through. If you are a healthcare provider, you will gain deeper compassion and tools to better help the patients you treat. Whatever your situation, you will never forget this highly educational and entertaining book!--Jo Rosen, President & Founder, Parkinson's Resource Organization, [...]"
5,A Must Read for Caregivers,"I laughed and cried -- and felt understood. This is a great book, written by someone with overwhelming compassion and a great sense of humor. Her examples and openness are extraordinary. And her succinct tips are invaluable. I'm recommending it to anyone I know over 30."
5,This book was very helpful!,"Some of Jacqueline's story is very similar to my own. This book was recommended to me because of my situation. There is so much useful information included in this book on dealing with the medical field and caregivers, as well as the various causes of the rages that can occur. As I have learned these past few years, dealing with dementia is very complicated. I also appreciated the fact that she included the information about her mother. I know that fear can cause even more difficulties. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is dealing with aging parents, not just those who have dementia or who are belligerent."
4,Elder Rage,"This book was an excellent twist on communicating valuable information for families with elder, senior citizen members. Though I prefer to skim books and this was difficult to approach that way, once I figured it out I found it compellingly informative. The language was, at times rough, but it was used to tell the story with the reality of what occurred in the author's family.I recommend this book."
4,My father has a twin!!!,"Once i started reading the book i could NOT put in down! I even went to my sisters house and read it to her! We could NOT believe that the man in this book is our fathers TWIN. As we all have different backgrounds, it was amazing that they were so similar. I found a way to handle my fathers ""outbursts"" better after reading this book.I struggle daily with medicare, doctors etc...on top of my father's self centered ways and needs for attention,and trying to keep peace with my husband and family. THANK YOU for this book!!"
4,Grounding,"Not being a media fan, I was not sure I would like this book. However, Jackie's stories and analogies keep the book light hearted when the subject matter is not. Dealing with my own health problems, friends' health problems and parents health problems can become overwhelming - as it certainly has been for me. This book is honest, and grounding. It reminded me how bad things were not, or how bad things were, and to use my resources. Most people write cheer leading type books, which make you feel like a loser if your family or yourself don't measure up to this amazing standard. Jackie is saint like, but in a very accessible way, which is supportive and helps you feel like you're not alone in this sometimes totally crazy and unfair world."
3,elderrage,Very funny. Saw my parents in every page. So true and a must read if you are having problems with your eldery parents
5,This book is a must for anyone who has elderly parents.,"I discovered Ms. Marcell&#65533;s book just at the point I thought I was ready to be admitted to the local psych ward. My elderly stepfather had recently started exhibiting extreme changes in behavior. He was angry and somehow everything that went wrong in his life was my fault. This book is an honest, often funny, account of her ""Life With Father and Mother"". Her personal experiences have really been helpful in putting our situation into perspective. The Physician&#65533;s Guide and caregiver resources at the end of the book as well the updates on her website are invaluable, especially for those of us just beginning to learn about elder care and the trials that can go with it. I wish I had found it earlier so we would have been able to recognize early signs of dementia and sought treatment and solutions before things got as out of control as they did."
4,helpful and funny,"Although our situations are not exactly the same, I could so relate to this story. My family has also been through lots of pain, growth, and eventual healing, and I loved hearing someone else tell the same story that I have been living through. And it was so funny and so true! And the comments about the doctors and social services - HA HAH!!!! Loved it! My Dad actually had a stroke a few days ago and will probably pass soon, so our journey will change again, but thank you for giving me something to read and hold onto in the last weeks of dealing with him."
5,A true story of a daughter's love and compassion,"This could be a novel! It is a great book with a fascinating story line, containing laugh-out-loud comedy, family conflict, violence, poignancy to the point of tears, frustration, humor, compassion, hatred and love. All the stuff of novels. But it is a true story of a daughter's love for her parents and her struggle to allow Dad and Mom to live and continue loving each other in their own home. A friend loaned me a copy of ElderRage-I couldn't put it down and finished it in two days. Then I bought 10 copies to give to people who are caregivers. Several friends then bought it themselves and can't say enough about how it helped them as they care for their loved ones. I even gave copies to each of our children so they will know how to deal with us if we have such problems. All of them said the same thing, ""Mom, I couldn't put it down once I started reading it!"""
5,Staying sane in an insane situation,"I thought I was the only one with this problem!!! How refreshing to read about it from another viewpoint, using the most hysterical kind of humor! It changed my whole outlook and now things are better for me and my family. Thank you Jacqueline!"
5,Elder Rage: Delightfully Entertaining and Insightful!,Anyone who even knows somebody with an elderly parent must read Elder Rage by Jacqueline Marcell. My husband and I couldn't stifle our laughter in Barnes and Noble just reading her table of contents! We were there to do the demographics on our own book and ended up buying hers. We couldn't put it down and bought at least 10 copies for our friends and family who in turn purchased copies for their friends. I have spoken to her on the phone several times and she is just as hilarious in person as her writing depicts. She is a terrific writer and person. You won't be disappointed in the least. Everyone should have their own copy.
5,Big help to another daughter of dementia patient,"Jackie's book was not only riveting -- I could not put it down nor attend to daily chores -- but it was extremely helpful. I understand now that my mother's apparent hatred of me, the primary caregiver, is the disease in action... Jackie's book helps me to understand the dynamics of this extreme behavior. I'm hoping I will be able to tell myself, ""It's just words,"" the next time my mother attacks me. This book is invaluable for someone going through the experience with a parent."
5,An Amazing Adventure,"Elder Rage kept me rivoted throughout the book. I learned, I laughed out loud and cried through the whole story. Jacqueline Marcell captured the essence of caring for elderly parents with all of the trials and tribulations caregiving entails. She showed how frustrating it can be working with multiple doctors, trying to receive good diagnosises and out-manipulating parents who were not ready to give up control. Unlike many other books, her humor made this a ""quick"" read and is well worth the time for anyone taking care of elderly patients."
5,useful page-turner or a page-turner that is also useful?,"Elder Rage surprised me. I thought I would be reading a useful how to guide on how to deal with our parents as they grow older and wierder. Indeed it is that, however to my delight it is also a page-turner showing the real life impact on all those around the elder person with problems.I found myself picking up the book at all kinds of odd times because I could not wait to get back to the story."
4,Terrifying,"I found this story to be terrifying. If we were not currently living with an Alzheimer's victim doing over night caregiving I'd swear this story was a lie or at least a gross exaggeration. The disease has transformed my boyfriend's mother from a sweet, bright woman who wouldn't swat a fly to a stubborn, belligerent, violent creature. It is heartbreaking to say the very least. This book made me feel less alone in the struggle."
3,Disappointing,"Disappointing. Unless you have a LO who suffers from rage as well as a dementing disease I don't think you will find much here. Most caretakers deal with more mundane things, the repeated questions, wandering, our LO trying to sort out who is who and other basic activities. I would venture that Ms. Marcell's experiences, while interesting, are not entirely typical of one with ONLY a dementing illness. Her father had problems that LONG preceded his dementia."
2,"A Horror Story, but short on Helpful Facts","Sorry, this book was a disappointment. The sub-title was, ""How to Survive Caring for Your Aging Parents"". Maybe I mis-read it as ""How to Care for your Aging Parents"".... But it did satisfy my needs.It is a hair-standing-on-end horror story of the author's elderly father who had one emotion, rage. The story would have made an interesting introduction to a factual self-help book, but the helps were only a few short appendices. The ""cute"" writing style wore thin, and after 70 pages.... off to the used bookstore box. Sorry."
1,Rage of Elders,"The crux of this book seems to be a daughter, spoiled but verbally abused, and her never ending childhood. She is now well into adulthood - I say grow up! All parents make mistakes. The elderly father is a handful, but most people in their 80s are! Her style of writing can only be described as cutesy, deviating far off the subject with flashbacks, then back with silly references to song titles. This is a serious subject. The best part of the book is the reference section in the back, which gives helpful information and references."
5,Elder Rage Coming of Age,"Jacqueline's book gives us a frightening peek into our future when you consider the sheer numbers of baby boomers headed towards their golden years, however, her message is loud and clear. There is help, hope and even happiness in the most difficult situations. If you know someone who is aging, or if you are the one aging, this book is definitely for you."
5,A MUST READ!,"I stumbled on Elder Rage by accident. It made me feel so much better about myself and the situation I am going through with my parents! It made me not feel like I was the ""only one"" out there! This was the first book of its kind that I'd ever seen and I feel like it's liberated me from something that I didn't realize was dragging me down!Thank you!!!!!!!!"
1,Not applicable to most people,"I did not find this book useful at all. I got it because it was so highly recommended but the author's situation is extreme. Also, she had way more time and resources to deal with the issues than the average person has available. If you are a person with an average income who has parents who are aging without any dementia issues, this book is not for you. Furthermore, I found the author's constant TV and song references annoying and distracting. I cannot understand why this book is so highly rated."
2,Not a how-to,This book is not a how-to; it's a story of one person's attempt to deal with her aging father. I did NOT find it useful to wade through all the stories to try to find the nuggets. There are plenty other good how-to books out there.
2,"self-centered, entitled whiner complains about dad","The section from page 272 on Behavior Modification, is moderately useful. The majority of the book though, is essentially an extended rant (with humor) on the injustice of having a father who misbehaves so badly, and how much it screws up the life of the author. It would be better except for the constant tone of self-pity, and the clear lack of sympathy and understanding for a man whose behavior is caused by neurologic disease (dementia) rather than simple ill-will. All events are interpreted in terms of their inconvenience, and understanding comes little and late in the narrative.I was hoping to recommend this book to the families of some of my more challenging patients (I am a geriatric neurologist), but this narrator really makes the process of caring for a parent with dementia sound like the greatest act of self-sacrifice known to (wo)man, rather than the fairly ordinary, if difficult, task that it is."
5,Very helpful!,"This book has helped me through a lot recently. I heard about it on the Today show in April. I ordered it that day. I cried while reading, thinking of what I have before me. I could not believe someone else had experienced something I was going through at that moment. This book is kept close by for those moments I need support."
5,Expertly Written!,"Baby Boomers caring for their aging parents (or worry they soon will be while heading into their own senior years), must put `Elder Rage' on their required-read list! Written in a compelling, humorous and meaningful way, it provides a roadmap for caring for resistant elders. If you know someone with short term memory loss or slightly odd behaviors, it may be the beginning of dementia and you will be very glad you read this valuable entertaining book.--Jon Roetman,The Easy Step by Step Guide for Self-Publishing Your Book in Print using Create Space (Publishing Made Ez)"
5,Elder Rage,"This book was really great - I was dealing with two parents with dementia and reading this book was such a help to me - very down to earth, honest and informing. Was very valuable"
5,"Been there, done that","What a wonderful book! Reading the book brought smiles as well as tears, especially for someone experiencing a similar situation. This book is highly recommended for caregivers/family seeing the initial signs of dementia, whether it be from Alzheimer's disease, multi-infarct,or and other cause. Reading of Jackie's tough times will ease the burden of caregivers when questioning ""what do I do?"" I wish I had this information 10 years ago when I began my journey with mom and dad. Wonderful, wonderful book!!!!"
5,Amazing,"Everybody with a parent who is ailing with dementia, even grandparent should read this book. Not only is it serious, but humerous and filled with very good ideas and information. Even people that may not have parents with dementia, but difficult doctors should read this book too!"
5,Great book to start finding a perfect job.,"The book is a complete guide to help you preparing to find a job. It works very well for me because it cover the latest trend of job Industry in general. The coverage of the industry trend is very important because it helps me to understand where the industry goes and how someone could find their perfect job based on their most interest and abilities. The book also provided with the Self-assessment exercise which also completed with the Personal Job Search Trainer which help me to focus on the job searching. Remember, finding a perfect job could be a full time job. Other aspect about the book that I like the most. It completed with advice from recuriter at 11 leading companies in America."
3,cute but cheap,"This bracelet is cute.. but small and cheap. I feel like it will break as soon as I put it on. I will be buying a different, more sturdy one."
5,Great Product excellent Price,"I wish I thought of this before. It fits most little kinz, and perhaps a few skinny webkinz."
4,A great book in the automotive world,"A great book on the history of one of America's most legendary carmakers. It has just enough history on John and Horace Dodge and their early beginings. It also goes into good detail about the later years after the company was acquired by Walter Chrysler. This is a must read for the avid automotive buff, especially for Dodge, Chrysler and Mopar fans."
5,Best translation by far,"Of all the compilations, I prefer this one as it gives you both the original Polish as well as the translated English. So if you are feeling ambitious, you can take a stab at the Polish. This is the best translation of her work by far -- it retains the lyrical intent of the author without being too literal. The poetry dances off your toungue and into your mind. If you read another version, you are missing out!"
3,"Good start, tailed off somewhat","This book gave me a good insight into La Guardia's career and personality. However I felt that while the first quarter of it was packed with insight and analysis, thereafter it became less analytical and more of a newspaper cuttings job. In other words, simply listing the events of his life in chronological order. That in itself is useful, especially for a student of his political campaigns and victories. But it felt less insightful and more writing by rote as the book went on."
2,Polyester- won't use it,"I don't know what I was thinking when I bought this- it's polyester! For everyone who says it breathes- no, it doesn't. Polyester does not breathe nor does it absorb. It holds wetness in simply because it doesn't absorb it. If you've ever worn a fleece sweater and then got warm and sweaty, you will know how uncomfortable it is to be in wet polyester fleece. I wouldn't do that to my kid! I'll stick to wool, thanks."
3,Rock,A great documentation of the bands early years despite the less than perfect video quality Bon Scott had a unique voice. It`s amazing that they could find a new singer to fit so well after his death.
5,A TRUE CLASSIC!!!,"This book is such a great read with fantastic stories about courageous people.It can be used as a motivational,self-help book if you're looking for what it takes to have guts in today's wimpy society.This book hits a home run with all ages. It should be promoted more."
4,Decent Speakers,"The bass is not powerful, but I have another woofer. If you have an extra woofer or don't mind low bass, the speakers highs are acceptable."
1,seductive but not worth the $$$,I know these look like a great idea but...I used to work at a gardening center - we'd put various kinds of plants in these and they'd always die as soon as these started to thrive. the water all sinks to the bottom of the bag and the top of the plant is in a state of continual wilting esp. in hot weather.
5,Great antihistamine,Great deal for the price. I really enjoy the redi tabs and the fact that they dissolve in seconds. the decongestant version is nice as well.
5,Still using,We have found this product to be very good for allergy related problems and the redi tab is great. Works faster.
3,Received wrong dosage.,I received the 12 hour 5 mg dosage instead of the 24 hour 10 mg dosage. At first I thought it was my mistake and started using the product so I never contacted the seller.
1,Contains sugar alcohol BEWARE,"I am sure that as an antihistamine that this product works great.However it contains Mannitol sugar alcohol.If this is an issue with you, you could be up all night in the restroom."
1,Don't work.,I have bought this product from CVS because I had to to get something ASAP because my allergies are REALLY bad. Didn't work at all.
5,Don't go to Tahiti without it,"Jan Prince's book Tahiti & French Polynesia Guide is undoubtedly one of the best books on Tahiti out there. If you're planning a trip to Tahiti and don't already have it, I suggest you buy it immediately. Between this book and True Tahiti Vacations, our incredible travel agent in Moorea, we planned the honeymoon of our dreams. Now, I'm using the book again to plan our vacation back to Tahiti this year. Thank you Jan!"
4,a lot information but...,"Its really good book with full of information about all islands, but...very thick and heavy. I had holiday in Bora Bora only, so I used only small part of this thick book, but i found all information. I think better have small one about only Bora Bora or other islands for example.There are no any photos in book. But, you can read about history of Tahiti, about culture and etc."
3,was a great Phone Directory!,"I felt the author was trying too hard to not give ""bad"" reviews. I had a hard time choosing which restaurants to try while on Moorea because the author gave a positive review for all of them.But the book was quite useful as a telephone directory! We were able to call the restaurants to have a car come pick us up with the help of the book."
3,Helpful but Lacking Depth,"As a Christian pastor wanting to teach my congregation the doctrines of practices of Islam, I was hoping for more information than I received here. A far better book, in my estimation, is Caner and Caner's *Unveiling Islam: An Insider's Look at Muslim Life and Beliefs*. It is also written by former Moslems and offers a wealth of information."
2,Not what you might think!,"From the description, I thought this was the book that I was looking for - an insider's look at the ""real"" Islam. While the author does spend a little time on origins, history, and beliefs of Islam, he spends the majority of the book telling us how to relate to and convert Muslims. I think that the author could perform better service by talking about the religion in depth to help us relate. I don't need a step-by-step conversion guide! However, it is well thought out and written, and I never questioned the author's sincerity, Christian faith, or motives."
1,Presenting facts out of context leads to false judgements,"The author has presented most information out of context to prove his point. It seems the author has a negative image about Islam and its fundamental beliefs. For example, the author presents the idea that Islam encourages war and violence if followed in its true essence, whereas if one would take the time to research the author's citations he/she would soon realize that falsified inforamtion has been presented. I would encourage readers who would like to discover more about Islam in its true essence to get a copy of the Quran and a biography about the Prophet Muhammad."
1,Inside Islam : Exposing and Reaching the World of Islam,A very misleading book. The author has not researched the subject well and much on the content seems to come from stereotypical misconceptions.
5,A book that EVERY American citizen (including Muslims) must read,"This is an excellent book that finally answered key questions for me. There are two important teachings that I have not found until now. First, a much better understanding of Muslims, what they believe, how they spread their religion, and the basis for how they live their lives. Second, by the Author's own experience, it explains how and why the Muslim faith is not based on complete truthfulness. This is better illustrated by the radical Muslims and intential violence. Would a good, honest, loving God preach hate and violence? Of course not. The author does a wonderful job of explaining Muslim history and his arguments are right on target. Thank God for Reza Safa!"
4,50s Fun,"This costume was purchased for my 16-month-old daughters to wear to a 50s-themed birthday party. The fact that the costume top and bottom are one piece works for children this age. The ""sweater"" is separate which allows for you to take it off if necessary and that, too, is a bonus. The quality of the material is poor, but as expected for a costume. The costume seems pretty true-to-size as they were big on my girls now, but we expect to get one or two Halloweens out of them too. The party theme was great fun for a child's party and the costume was an inexpensive way to get into it. They were a big hit!"
3,readable,"this book makes some interesting points, and some true ones. however, its downfall is its sensationalism. 'devil's night' finds its audience in people who love to hear bad things about detroit--& urban america in general. it is not a truly balanced story, although it is the account you will find on most news shows & magazine covers. i encourage you to investigate other angles on detroit."
4,Very comfortable and fit perfectly!,"I received this item very quickly as I have with everything I've ordered from Amazon. This is the first time I've ordered shoes online because I worry about the fit. These fit great! I was very pleased about that. I'm not crazy about the way the shoes look on me, but they were comfortable enough to over look that."
1,Sooooooo Confused,"My mother, little brother and myself were so confused by the directions that we still haven't been able to play. It was my little brother's christmas gift and I was so disappointed when I tried to read the directions. My mother and I just couldn't get it to work. ..."
3,Help!,"I agree with the other reviewers who say that the directions are hard to follow. We have tried to play this game a few times but feel that we need to have quite a chunk of time as we still rely heavily on the instructions....which are quite inexplicit as to the rules for play. Maybe one of the enthusiasts who actually could decifer some rules could let the rest of us in on the secrets! The kids and I (3 boys ages 6, 9,10) are all BIG Harry Potter fans so this game was disappointing as we still haven't figured it out....I'm even a teacher. I guess I'll have to see if one of my kids in class can figure it out."
3,To be 8 years old again!,"This game is confusing! Perhaps if I were 8 and not 60+ I might be able to ""get it"". Be prepared for a long, slow learning curve. Better instructions might help. My wife and I will keep at it."
1,better instructions,"It seems that a lot of people are having many difficulties trying to work out the very inadequate instructions. My mother and I found it very frustrating not to be able to understand how to play the game, even after a long time of trying to read the instructions. Is there anywhere we can get a more detailed and easy to understand instructions for this card game?"
5,Very Entertaining!Extraordinarily! BETTER THAN POKEMON CARDS,"This is the most entertaining game to come down the pike since you discover pokemon cards. Harry Potter, the KING OF ALL KIDS is in a form of card playing. Should I add that this is the original, in your face game, the best ever. Forget POKEMON. Put down any other game. it catches all senses, stunning. itws extraordinarily, FUNNY, RAUCOUS. this game takes no prisoners. your kid will love it because there is something refreshing about playing with nothing to be offended by, and a lot to gain! Very Entertaining!"
3,Pretty Fun But quite confusing,"I got this game for my little sister for her 13th B-Day. We are both big HP fans. But I found the game to be quite dissapointing. The different spells and jinxes make for a very confuing game. I do think that this game is pretty fun, but it is not a game to be played for relaxation, the constant reference to the instructions prevents that. I think that this game is a good investment for any HP fan, but do not recommand it to the younger group."
3,This game would be OK for a die-hard Harry Potter fan,"I recieved this game as a Christmas present, and I have to say: the instructions are VERY poorly written and confusing. They also don't tell you everything that you have to do. Even for me, an 8th grader at the top of my class, it was confusing. I admit, it is any Harry Potter fan's dream to play Quidditch, and that alone would be enough for me..."
3,Confused on Quidditch,The rules were very confusing to understand even though we have read all the books. Too complicated for beginners
2,CONFUSING!!!!,It looks like a lot of fun......if only I could figure out how to play it! The directions are really long and confusing. Nobody in my family(6 of us) could figure them out. If they where shorter they would be easier to understand.
2,Save your money!,"This card game is a waste. The instructions must have been written by a rocket scientist, because I spent 45 minutes reading them, and still they didn't make a whole lot of sense. It seems to me that maybe Mattel needs to consider that a good portion of the people attempting to play this game are under the age of 12. After an hour of struggling through this game, I threw it in the garbage can."
4,Fun Read,"I'm not a huge fan of Julia Roberts, but I decided to pick up this book and I thought it was a really fun read. Its light, easy to read and quick. I read it while on vacation and thought it was perfect for the time I spent by the pool. Mark Bego really knows his subject. I learned a lot and am definitely a fan. I will read anything else Mark writes...especially on my next vaction!"
1,Superficial rehash,"No new information. No new insights. Not even a very interesting approach to old information. The whole book is just cut & paste. The author, Mark Bego, just strings together a bunch of quotes from two movie guides and some popular magazines. There are 40 small black & white photos, about half publicity stills and the rest reprinted from news magazines. The book has no index."
2,Doesn't Make Much Sense,"I got this game for Christmas and I couldn't understand it. I've read all the books twice and listened to them. I could not answer the questions. I mean, who really cares what the name of Neville's great uncle is? It's not that important! The layout and rules of the game are very confusing. Do youself a favor, and save your money for better things!"
2,Not much good...could have been much better,"I enjoyed playing this game, but it does have a large number of flaws. You really do have to have read the first Harry Potter book quite thoroughly, because some of the questions are really quite challenging if you don't use the multiple choice. Younger children - my sister at age 10 included even had problems with this game - some of the rules are confusing. Once you have the hang of this game {you should use the multiple choice included, it's much easier if you do} it's actually fairly easy and not a challenge. However, the rules are confusing - I ended up pretty much making up the rules as we went. This game had the potential to be so much better, and Mattel have stuffed it up. If you're really a Potter nut, I mean really a huge fan, go ahead and buy the game. I think it was just a waste of money, personally. It's not a 'you're not a Potter fan if you don't have this' kind of game."
3,Someone Sold Out.........,"Typical. As soon as anything becomes popular, big coporations attempt to squeeze every last dollar out of it. Harry Potter movies, toys, video games, stationary. This christmas every little fool in America will be pleading to their mom & dad to have every Harry Potter merchandising product there is. Warner Bros. are probaly laughing all the way to the bank as we speak. Even Joanne Rowling said ""If they start making Harry Potter action figures, tell the (your children"" that I said not to buy them (the toys)"".These games are totally unoriginal, obviously conjured up while the hype lasts. Almost exactly the same as Clue (or Cluedo) and Trivial Pursuit. Do yourself a favor and buy these games, much more deserving of your dollar (cheaper too!) than throw away your cash on a Harry Potter game that you know you'll find in the bin, once the next fad/craze comes in. And out. Scooters anyone?"
4,A delightful suprise,"With the huge uincrease in interest of Hummel and other such conmposers, surely too Czerny will follow in these footsteps. But I do find the Concerto somewhat laboured and lacking the flair it should have despite there being lovely passages. However it cannot meet the spendid recording of the A minor concerto by the now deceased Felicja Blumental. The second symphony was a pleasnt suprise and beautifully played.Lets hope for more of his substantial works to be recorded.S J McLaren"
5,Works!,The spout fits right inside the lip of empty gallon milk containers which I use to transport to the local recycling center. The pan works - like a pan. Haven't run into any problems. My only complaint is that this drain pan won't change my oil for me.
2,It bored me.,"Flat, toneless singing. Endless repetition. Zzz...The last track ""Rise"" is nice. It is a remix of a track that is available on at least one other Om CD. The original is better than the remix though.This CD is a good value though, in terms of total minutes. There is a lot of music here. I suspect that most of it is looped, though."
5,"Old Fish Hawk, Audio Abridged Edition","A very nice story, well told. True to the time period and location, the Missouri Ozarks in the mid 1800s. Read by the author with a pure, Southern Ozarks accent. This can take some getting used to, even for a Missouri native like myself, but don't give up on it, the story is worth the listening effort. My one criticism would be that Mr. Jaynes seems to be a little rushed in his reading, which makes interpretion of his accent that much more difficult."
4,The true sence of the Ozarks. Very Good,The true sence of the Ozarks is the center of this audio tape. I could relate much of this story to our moving to the Ozarks in the early 60's.There were families that were much like this still around. Very good.
2,Tired of these already,I have been using these for about 1 1/2 months and I am not impressed with these trash bags at all. They tear pretty easily towards the top of the bag. I really wish I would not have purchased 6 boxes of these bags.
3,They work but they didn't fulfill a need ignored by the regular version,These are stretchy which is kind of creepy. I have a 10 gallon trash can so this standard size is usually enough even when garbage accumulates higher than it should. The flex may be more tearproof than the regular version but I found the honeycomb visual to be disturbing when I pulled this out of the can. I have gone back to the regular style.
3,Lisa Bouchelle Band,"Never listened to the cd, just clips, saw her live a number of times. She's getting better all the time!!!"
5,awesome disc! can't wait to hear more,This disc is very well done. The recording itself is top notch! Some professional bands don't have this good of a recording. The songs are excellent in that the entire disc takes you on a musical and diverse journey. i highly recommend this disc to anyone if you're into girl-rock. Can't wait to hear some more!
5,perfect service.,"All the compilation are perfect.I love all the track even 2 of then was not in the original vinyl, but it ok the other two tracks..some of them but is good for the personal collection."
1,Thinking of buying this game . . . STOP!,"Anyone that played Rebound as a child remembers how fun it used to be, whether playing against a friend, parent, or just playing around on your own. THIS IS NOT THE GAME YOU REMEMBER! Sure, it's the same ""game"", but what comes out of the box is not what you remember.First, the game board comes in two pieces, not the smooth, solid single board that the older version had. This means the playing pieces hit a noticeable drop at each seam.Second, the playing pieces aren't the heavy, smooth rolling pieces of the old set. These are lighter and don't track straight even on the kitchen table.Finally, because of its construction the playing surface isn't level, and skill or no, it's nearly impossible to aim your shots like you could in the old game. It's frustrating, even for my older kids.The game I bought my kids has been repacked and is going back to the store. Save your money on this one."
1,They have ruined this classic,The two piece board construction does not stay together. The two board pieces don't even come close to aligning so there is a drop that makes the pieces move unpredictably. The boards are warped so all shots fall to one side. The rubberbands that came with the game fell apart before being stretched. The game pieces themselves are so cheap and shoddily made that they will stick. This was a huge disappointment. It is unplayable in this version.
3,Rebound Game by Mattel,"The older version of this game was made much better as it had a wooden board. I guess most games/toys nowadays just aren't made like they used to be. If I had known that the game was on a plastic board that doesn't fit well together in the center of the board, I think I would have purchased this more as a ""shuffle board"" game through a magazine I received in the mail. It was a one piece board made out of wood. The seller on this item however was absolutely fantastic, and I would purchase from them again and again."
4,Adventure science-fiction at it's literate best,"Ah, this was such a satisfying novel. It follows three primary characters over a century as they are part of the effort to study Halley's comet. They discover a primitive life-form which attatches itself to the humans in a symbiotic relationship and eventually causes them to be an imagined threat to Earth.The theme of genetically enhanced humans (Percells) and the rivalry between them and the normal humans is explored. Some consider this an overworked theme, but the authors here approach it from a logical perspective.This is a good read and quite recommended for science-fiction readers."
4,"An adventure, with science, surprises, and perseverence!","Starting off slowly and working to a moderate head, this advanture/drama encapsulizes all different elements: A microcosm of society complete with human interaction, idealogical divisions, and eventually, conflict. Scientific mysteries appearing at every bend. And, of course, obvious prospects for a sequel!"
2,"ok story, but too long and contains questionable science","I would have enjoyed this a lot more if it had been half the length. The characters are all defined by their nationalities and scientific specializations and not much else. I have a hard time buying one of the main ideas, that humans could become symbiotic with extraterrestrial life forms over a period of only a hundred years. Evolution just doesn't happen that fast."
4,"A great example of ""hard"" sci-fi","My dad, who got me started on sci-fi as a kid, recently complained that too much of today's sci-fi is more fantasy than science. I'm going to send him this book for Christmas, because it tackles so many areas -- space travel, biology, even sociology. I thought it was one of the best hard sci-fi books I've read, ever."
5,hope for the comet,I just finished this book and anyone who enjoys hard s/f would probably enjoy this book. My main reason for a review is to request that the authors consider a sequel as I have noticed several people hoped for the same thing in other reviews.I thought the start of this journey is fantastic and it needs to be continued!
1,Nope,"This book is just tripe to feed off the the ""vampire community."" Virtually all of the Egyptian references have been culled from the Temple of Set's Order of the Vampyre which predates this book and the ""vampire community."" If you really want to learn about vampires I suggest you look into the Temple of Set's Order of the Vampyre instead of white washed right hand path material such as this."
3,Best for newcomers and the merely curious,"Mano Negra have scores of songs in their catalog, so it's anyone's guess why Ark 21 released this 37-minute, 13-track compilation at full price. That being said, some of their best songs are included, covering the range of their influences from rockabilly (""Rock Island Line"") to dub (""Sueno de Solentaname""). Features what is surely one of the strongest popular music portraits of a Latin American dictator: ""Senor Ma Tanza."""
4,Best? of the Best!,"Mano Negra may well be the greatest rock band ever (they surely were the best live band I have ever seen). But, since they came from France, you might have never heard of them. Well, now it is your chance to make up for it. From 1988 to 1994, they revolutionized rock music by mixing Punk and Funk with traditional music from Arabia, Africa, Latin America, Spain and their native France. Also, in many countries, they were the first rock superstars to sound different from what came from England and the USA, so they became role models for a whole generation of non-anglo rockers. Every track in this CD rocks. Tracks 1, 2, 5, 8, 10 and 11 are in English (in a very thick French accent). Tracks 3, 6, 7, 9 and 12 are in Spanish. Track 4 is in some unidentified Arab language, while track 13 is in French."
3,Size 7 bigger than my other sneakers,I always loved reebok but this time the size seven was bigger than my other shoes and they go damaged quickly in the back as my foot was loose
2,"service good, shoes uncomfortable",they were in perfect shape it just doesnt seem like they should fit like that (not the sellers fault)
5,Why haven't you bought this yet?,"This is my favorite acoustic guitar!! If I buy another one, it will be another Taylor, probably a 614ce...Everyone that plays it cannot believe the sound it produces. I play for a church, and I currently play directly into the system, and the sound is awesome!!!"
2,An Exhausting Read,"I couldn't believe this story took place in just one day. It literally wore me out. I had read and liked several of Anne Tyler's books when they first came out, but after a few books, the quirkiness simply got annoying, and morphed into ""precious"".I'm reading this as part of a Pulitzer Prize library book club, and frankly it makes next month's selection, The Executioner's Song, look downright cheery. I gave it 2 stars because I know there were examples (none of which I can remember) of a very small comment or description that highlighted a much larger concept of human nature. But Maggie, pleeeeeeeeeeeeese, enough's enough! Most of her escapades were just too predictable. It was hard to see her as a sympathetic character when all I could visualize was Edith Bunker!I recognize that this book is almost 25 years old. Maybe Breathing Lessons, Anne Tyler, or me just haven't aged well."
2,Not worth it,"It was an extremely well-written very boring book. Nothing really happens, it raises more questions than it answers, and is just depressing."
4,Bubble Head,"The story makes you want to take this female bubble head and shake her. How could anyone be so stupid and self centered? And yet, how do we know we aren/t getting it right. Maybe that is the whole point of the book."
2,Didn't Care For It,The character was at times unbelievable. And the story didn't seem to have a plot.
2,"One endlessly long episode of ""I Love Lucy""","Although I enjoyed this book at first(I laughed out loud a few times), I soon began to tire of what I realized was one endlessly long episode of ""I Love Lucy"", right down to Ira's hair and skin color. We're supposed to love Maggie the way we loved Lucy, but frankly I tired of Lucy at an early age--mostly because she represented women as befuddled nitwits who couldn't fight their way out of a wet paper sack. I'd like to see more books on the Pulitzer Prize list with female protagonists who are not helpless, pathetic and devoid of lives."
3,Hard to get past annoying main character,"Maggie goes to a funeral of her best friends husband andentangles herself in nearly everyone's life. Maggie is a meddler notabove twisting the truth to bend life to her vision of it. In the endthe tangled web annoys and angers nearly everyone around her and isjust painful to read. I'm familiar with the ""if it's painful andyou hate the characters it must be good literature"" school ofthought and maybe it is, the pulitzer people thought it was. But formy money and time I'd skip it"
1,Most annoying book I ever remember reading...,This must be the most annoying book I can ever remember reading. The lead character Maggie just made me feel like slapping her! So at least in that respect the book did provoke an emotional reaction. I forced myself to finish the book and now wonder why...
1,Horribly boring,"This is one of the most boring books I've ever read. I wanted to quit reading it many times, but I always hate quitting a book before it's done. The book takes place over one day and is way too descriptive. The characters are extremely annoying. They say and do things that are so stupid I wanted to choke them. Besides that, it doesn't even turn out well. I was so bored I didn't even read the last page, I finally gave up on it."
2,Pulitzer? Really?,"I had only read one of Anne Tyler's books, A Patchwork Planet, and I happened to mention to a friend that I didn't see what the big deal about her was. She told me I'd read one of her minor works, and that I should give this ""wonderful author"" another try. So I picked Breathing Lessons, figuring I couldn't go wrong with a Pulitzer Prize winning novel.Well, I still don't get what the big deal about Anne Tyler is, and I'm baffled as to why this novel received the Pulitzer. It's dull and not particularly well-written--an average novel about some very average people."
2,Couldn't get through it.,"Try as I might, I simply couldn't get through this book. The characters are well defined, but that's because it seems to be all Ms. Tyler does. The dialogue between husband and wife on the way to the funeral was darkly comic and mildly amusing, but page after page later, I felt that it was too much of the same. For those reading this review, please keep in mind that my commentary only refers to the first part of the book, as I couldn't get past the redundancy any further than that. Considering this book won the 1988 Pulitzer, it must be worth delving further into the story; I hope you can make it."
4,amusing and sprinkled with quirks.,"I enjoyed this one, as I have always enjoyed Tyler's books. The amusing bit about the husband who whistles `appropriate' tunes during `appropriate' (?) moments had me in stitches! Mrs. Moran is sooo full of quirks that I wish I could shake some sense into her. If I could have done that, I would have given a better rating of the book! (just kidding)"
2,A waste of precious reading time!!,"With so many good choices out there, why spend any time on a ho-hum, at times even annoying read? The characters are all pathetic people living apathetic lives that I didn't even care about! All I cared about was how fast could I finish this book about losers and start a good book?!! Don't bother with this one! I wish somone would have told me that before I picked it up!"
3,Like taking a car ride with your crazy relatives,"I bought this book when it was first published and let it sit on my bookshelves getting old and musty. What a shame, because this was the perfect book to read over the Thanksgiving holidays. It's about a day spent with a meddling, but lovable woman and her self-righteous, but equally lovable husband as they travel from Baltimore to Pennsylvania and back. Ride along in the backseat with them. It will drive you nuts, but in a fun way."
3,Breathing space by,"This was someones book club choice, we struggled with it but it created a lively and suprisingly heated response."
2,A Pulitzer? Really?,"Pulitzer Prize winners should have deeper social meaning than this trifle, or at least have a better plotline and memorable characters. This one, a day in the stubbornly ordinary lives of Maggie and Ira Moran, is imminently forgettable. The old couple bickering will wear you out by the halfway point, and the characterizations of Maggie as the eccentric wife and Ira as the long-suffering husband have been done before, and much better. There is a great deal to be said about the drama of ordinary life, but I don't see any of it here. Take a look at some other Pulitzer Prize winners instead of this one: Annie Proulx, Richard Russo's ""Empire Falls,"" and even Marilynne Robinson's flawed ""Gilead"" have much more intelligent things to say about life lived out of the fast lane, and are much more poignant and memorable than this bickering couple standing on the side of the road."
2,I Must Have Missed Something,"I think I must have missed something with this book. It won the Pulitzer and was also the Time Book of the Year for 1989. I really don't get it. I mean, it was fine. It was just the story of an average married couple, traveling to a funeral and back. Nothing terribly exciting happens. The characters were completely forgettable and felt really cut and dry for me. Not a lot of depth.Overall, I didn't get bored or annoyed while reading the book, but it left pretty much no impact on me."
1,Pulitzer Prize Winner......really??,"I was irritated by certain aspects of this book, namely, the character of Maggie. She is a self absorbed, interfering, scheming, immature person. Ira was almost unaware of himself and really didn't lend much to anything in the story. Everytime Maggie did something that didn't work out the way she perceived it, it was almost telegraphed; you could see it coming a mile away. It just seemed to plod along. I was expecting these profound discoveries about themselves as a person and hoped that it would evoke a little change in themselves. The characters ended up exactly the same as they had always been. I am a little dumbfounded that this was a Pulitzer Prize winner."
1,What?,"Did I miss something? I kept waiting for something to happen. I would have stopped reading it but I kept waiting for something to happen. This woman, Maggie, was everything a mother should not be: too permissive, a push over, dim-witted...the list goes on and on. This book is not worth your time."
2,Ordinary does not have to be ugly,This book depressed me. I don't understand what other people see in it. I was thrilled when I finished it. I don't think Anne Tyler is my taste.
3,For this a Pulitzer Prize?,"True, Anne Tyler paints a colorful, vivid picture of the Morans, their marriage, their concerns for family and friends. And, at times, her writing is funny-many scenes would translate well on film. I'm just not sure its message is all that memorable."
3,A book that was easy to put down and leave down!,"This was my first opportunity to read a book by Tyler and I wish now I would have started with ""The Accidental Tourist"". The story was at times quirky and funny; I did laugh out loud a couple of times. However, it never really seemed to get off the ground and I was hoping for a more purposeful ending. It's OK as a filler book, but not one I would necessarily recommend."
3,Surprised that I didn't like it as I love her other books,"Having read her other books I thought that I'd enjoy Breathing Lessons. I struggled, found the people irritating and remembered it as a disappointment.I tried again recently, thinking it would seem better now I wasn't expecting it to be good, but I couldn't even finish it this time, I was so bored!"
2,Parts were good but most were bad,The character Maggies is one of the most annoying characters I've read. I kept wishing that someone would just tell her to mind her own business. Definitely not one of Tyler's best.
5,The Anti Misanthropist,"Graham Greene said that the novelist needs to have in his heart a chip of ice. Arnold Bennet wrote that a novelist should possess a 'Christ-like all consuming humanity'. I know to which school Anne Tyler belongs. Her books are, quite simply, funny, wise and sad. Her characters, as G K Chesterton said of Dickens' creations, are such that 'you couldn't forget them if you would and you wouldn't forget them if you could'. Buy them all, read them: they'll improve your life!"
3,hmmmm.....,Not quite sure it was my favorite of her work. It seemed a tad slow; a tad too deliberate. Not recommending.
4,Well written but dismal.,This book fit my tired and stressed mood in a life that is changing too much too fast with my job and my friends and my love life. It isn't really a book you can describe by plot. Nothing specific actually happens. This older couple is taking a roadtrip for a sad reason. They are thinking about things as they go. It's good if you don't want things to change. The writing is really nice and the dialogue too.
2,POINTLESS AND RATHER DEPRESSING,"I really enjoyed Anne Tyler's new book ""Noah's Compass"" so I went back to reading some of her older novels. I picked up ""Breathing Lessons"" at a library book sale for fifty cents. I am glad I didn't pay more. I don't understand the point to this book, it wasn't interesting and didn't have any surprises (like Noah's Compass). I found it to be rather depressing. The only part that was interesting was after Maggie watched the film from her friend's wedding and realized her original feelings for her husband.I don't think I can read another of her novels."
2,"An utter, irritating bore",I was recently on a business trip and found myself without a book to help me pass the hours on the plane. I bought Breathing Lessons thinking it would help me feel better about living an ordinary life. I was right all along -- ordinary IS boring. I would have abandoned the book in the middle had I not been captive on a plane.
1,terrible,Este libro es el mismo como todos los otros libros de John Grisham. El hombre no puede escribir una novela interesante y original. Ojala que John Grisham no escriba mas libros porque son ejemplos de el condicion terrible de la novela in los tiempos modernos.El Rey Leon
5,PERFECT IS GOOD ENOUGH,AMASING DETAIL.If you have interest in the High Peaks trails this book tells all. I dont want to write anymore.
2,Not that great,"I was dissappointed in the molds that came with the sand, we couldn't get the sand OUT of them! My 4 year old and 7 year old had a blast messing around with the sand, before it slowly dissapeared from falling on the ground (I put it on the table outside) and getting stuck in the molds. If it was as cheap as playdough I would be all for it, but it's not worth replacing in my opinion."
1,Not as advertised.,"My daughter begged for this for Christmas and the commercials looked good so we bought it. Two months later, the stuff is gone. Bits of it landed on the floor each time. It doesn't stick together like on TV. It doesn't work well in the molds either. My daugher now likes Playdough better."
1,"In my opinion, don't waste your money!","What a huge disappointment. After seeing the commercials, I thought what a cool gift this would make for my 3.5 year old daughter. Hmm, how do I best describe my disappointment? Perhaps it's because it's a HUGE mess, the sand doesn't stick together (but sticks to EVERYTHING else), there isn't enough sand to even fill the molds that come in the kit (huh??), you can't get the sand out of the mold very easily, the formed sand falls apart easily, I can go on and on.... Save your money and your frustration - buy play-doh!"
4,Content good. Package sucks!,"Probably the most comprehensive calisthenic book I've ever read. With that said, the binding to this book is cheap, real cheap! the pages easily separated from the binding. This should have been physically put together more professionally. Otherwise excellent content."
2,Not worth the price!,"I recently ordered Peterson's book and I must be blunt. This book by no means is really worth the price tag. Most of the book is simple isometrics. If you want to learn isometrics, go to your library or on the internet and you will be able to get plenty of info. Peterson and others here market the book as if it is a comprehensive body-weight workout guide, but that really isn't the case. After giving the book a good look-over I sent it back and decided on Matt Furey's Combat Conditioning. Although I am not overly impressed with Furey's book....it really is bodyweight workout programs....not isometrics. So be wary of some of the reviews here, and understand this book is basically a guide to isometrics. Thanks."
5,Pushing yourself to Power is GREAT,"In Pushing Yourself To Power John Peterson does a wonderful job of defining a body weight approch to exercies. I have read and followed several books that advocate body weight exercies. John's is the best. It is laid out nicely, with clear explination and phots. I have already recommeded it several times. It is great for the beginer and the advanced."
3,A good adjunct,"A good system but it does not replace working out with weights. It is, however, a good adjunct to weight training.I'm sure others disagree as Mr. Peterson enjoys quite a cult following. I would take their embellishments with a grain of salt.There is also Christian tone to the text which is somewhat annoying in Pat Robertson kind of way. But he doesn't suggest that you should assasinate any foreign leaders...just a few banal bible verses."
4,solid work-out opportunities,"There are many good excercises in this book. It is remarkable how fatigued one's muscles can become without using any exterior weights for lifting.If you cannot look past a number of borderline misogynistic passages, as well as a whole lot o' bible-talk, than you may want to look elsewhere for a book on bodyweight excercises. But if you can focus on the excercises and ignore the authors agenda and personality, you will find a valuable resource here."
3,Good Info / Poor binding,"Got this book on a Wedensday. Finished it on the same day. It was an easy read. Lots of pictures and big type. Great pictures to illustrate the exercises. Good exercises. A lot of repetition though. Could have been half the size. The author is definitely in great shape and I will use a lot of the information to give it a real try. My main problem with this book is the binding fell apart on day one. I opened the book and the bottom of the pages started to come apart. Buy the time I was on Lesson 2, I had about a dozen loose pages. No big deal, but not what I'd expect from a book I just purchased either."
5,The only book you'll ever need.,"Large books like these have a tendency to close unless you keep them open. A spiral edition stays open. Buy the spiral edition. You will be really pleased.I have read and bought reading material for 30+ years. Mr. Peterson is the most interesting writer of exercise. He is a testament to his system. He is over 50 and has a built that 20 year olds would envy.There is just the right amount of nutrition info but not too much.His description and instruction is very detailed, not like others who only have a starting and finishing photo.If you do not collect or spend a lot of time reading exercise books for entertainment, you will have all you need with just this purchase."
4,Very good book,"If you're interested in learning Charles Atlas type 'Dynamic tension' exercises, than this is the book for you. I've been training many years, and in addition to weight training, bodyweight calisthenics, and Isometrics, I occasionally use this type of training. Unlike his new book on Isometrics, where I essentially learned nothing, I did learn a few good techniques and methods in this book. It's a decent book and it's not a bad addition to any fitness Library."
5,MUST HAVE FOR PIANO PLAYERS!!!,"This is the best, most complete version of music from the Star Wars Trilogy you can get. It is written like it just came of the from the pen of the mighty John Williams himself. It is written for piano (even though it does not say it)and it is fairly advanced. I would say you should have been playing the piano for 3 to 4 years to be able to sit down and go through all the songs, I believe a less difficult version is available but I have not seen it a Amazon.com. This is MUST HAVE if you love the music from Star Wars, and who doesn't?"
2,Most of the songs are abridged,"When I bought the book, I expected what would be nearly the full score. However, most of the songs have been shortened and simplified to save space and to make playing the songs easier. However, the songs tend to lose some of their spirit when abridged. While many of the main rhythms are demonstrated, many small details that show specific emotion in the movie are left out. The songs lose their value. I think that the origional score, unabridged, should be released."
3,cannot specify instrument when ordering,"I don't have the music yet, but I can comment on Amazon's handling of this product. Before ordering, I read Michael's review about receiving music for the wrong instrument. I noticed that there is no way to indicate which instrument when ordering. I thought I might be safe in that I ordered other violin music along with this title, however Amazon sent me clarinet music. When I returned it and asked for violin music, they sent me clarinet music again. I returned it again and am waiting to see what I'll get."
4,"Good; however, the difficulty level is not consistent throughout Book",Good book for the songs - it's nice to play the star wars music.Some songs are easy.Some are more difficult.While parts of some songs are very difficult and some are too easy.It would be better if all the songs were at the same difficulty level.
1,The Star Wars Trilogy,"We asked for the trumpet version for the Star Wars Triology and received the piano version. Also, we were charged $4.99,but when received, the sales sticker read $3.00. We e-mailed them about our concerns several weeks ago and have yet to receive a response. 8735ccr."
5,the unbearable lightness of being Jim,"It's lovely to see all 5 Jim's Journal collections in a single volume. J.J. is a cumulative experience -- you can't appreciate the strips unless you read a bunch of them in succession. After a few dozen strips or so, you begin to gradually succumb, until you're hopelessly addicted to the strangely hypnotic flow of Jim's uneventful life. Dikkers makes some interesting comments about how he sees his work (""anti-comedy"" in the tradition of Andy Kaufman), and while his revelations aren't astounding, they do add value for people who already own some of the other J.J. collections. Soothing and worthwhile."
4,"Sara Groves ""Add to the Beauty""","Greetings, friends. This is beautiful CD with excellent tracks, Sara's great voice, and her true Christian faith. Check out the title cut, ""Add to the Beauty""; it brings to mind many images including Colossians 1:24. You might also enjoy, ""Just Showed up for My Own Life"", a powerful song of repentence, realization, and reality. ""You are the Sun"" praises the Lord Jesus Christ with allusion to Malachai 4:2. Sara is so honest and vulnerable in her music that it will touch you deeply."
5,can't go wrong with sara groves...,A Christian Joni Mitchell in that her lyrics are as engaging as her arrangements. She is disarmingly transparent and insightful.
2,waste of money,My husband and I played this game with another couple and we were all disappointed that it is very different than the game show. We all agreed that it could have and should have been made more like the actual game show. It was a waste of money.
1,Be Warned! Stay Away!,"This is the first time I'm writing a review of anything on Amazon.com, but I need to warn people about this game. It would be great except for 2 problems:1. It skip excessively.2. There is no way to easily skip past games that you've played. So once you've taken out that DVD, put it back in and you'll recognize the questions -- you've answered them already!Not recommended.If I could give it negative stars, I would. However, Amazon makes you give it at least 1."
4,Fun DVD game,"Coming from a long time Family Feuding family, I found the game to be very fun and always different! The DVD technology mixes up the game each time we play, which keeps the game new and exciting. The limitations of the assigned answers is challenging, but we have figured out how to play the game within the context of the game and we really enjoy it! I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys Family Feud!"
2,Not for Families,"I agree with the other review. We bought this to play with the family. I do not know why it is even called Family Fued. The questions are inappropriate for kids. Way too much about sex. My kids after the first time playing asked ""What is a stripper""? Not the way they need to learn about grown up topics. I am very dissapointed in the company for making these questions. If they want adult topics make a seperate game for that!"
1,"POOR GAME, repeats constantly","I've played the game maybe five times. The same questions came up at least three out of those five. In short, no fun. It's also not like the game we see on TV. SO not worth the cost. Whoever created it should be ashamed."
5,board game,My children and I have so much fun with this game. This game makes any person think and use the brain.
3,After the first 2 times this game is not as fun,The first time that I played this game it was great. The second time was ok. By the third time everyone knew all of the answers. I recommend passing this game on to another familly after you are done with it.
2,Random Shuffle????,We purchased this game in Florida to play with our kids. I agree that the questions are very adult in nature and the answers repeat themselves. We only played it about 6-8 times and now it seems that the same games keep coming back. Is there a way to access a menu that offers a shuffling option or something? Or is there only about that many games on the dvd? The makers website is not working so I can't get help there.I would not recommend this game especially since it is not geared toward families and doesn't allow you to continously play it.Spend the 20 dollars and take your family out for ice cream you'll have a better time and you won't have to explain alot of adult answers.
1,Survey says,"Unlike board games where only a limited number of people can participate, the DVD game allows everyone in the room to join in. Teens and adults both enjoyed playing this game."
3,"Jazzy...not the best, but nice to have","I love Big Band songs, and this is a good addition to my small collection. Nothing too ""wowing"", but fun to have."
4,Great video music,"Downloaded this album and used ""Moonlight Serenade"", ""Sentimental Journey"", and ""I'll Be Seeing You"" for a video photo montage for my mother's 90th birthday party. Very nice, smooth instrumental music and they worked great in the video. Nice music to have on in the background as you're doing things around the house or at work, too."
5,get some love songs,"my wife and i love these songs. we had this cd years ago, but lost it along the way. when we found it again, we just had to have it."
4,Somebody Too,"Somebody too really addresses and brings to light the fact that there is a person and a story behind all those alcoholics we may see and casually dismiss as just another no good drunk.In her southern style, Ms. Ware relays her story from a family perspective presenting the sad, progressive demise of her brother from a fun loving young man to a tortured alcohol.When reading this,one can feel the degradation he endured andthe pain of the family that had to helplessly stand by as hesunk deeper and deeper into a hell from which he was unable toescape.This book is recommended reading for anyone whose life may have been touched by alcoholism and a reminder that there is a person inside if we take a closer look.It was a very thought provoking piece!"
4,Good comprehensive book,The book was useful in understanding the problem of prostate inflammation treatment and different categorizations of prostatits.
3,"Go, Pappster!","This is deep and fun. I haven't bought good house like this in a while. I thought the beginnings and endings on the continuous mix were better than the middle. I love the Pet Shop Boys, but I'm tired of their cheesy remakes. Here, Papp includes a slammin' version of ""I Didn't Mean to Turn You On."" It's the highlight of the disc for me. I like it as much as Mariah's version. This reminds me of how the remake of ""My Funny Valentine"" was the best song on one of his prior discs. The continual mix ends with an instrumental to cool you down, just like the After Dark Paris CD. The second CD is unmixed. The listener can program their favorite cuts accordingly. I thought the second disc was just imitation Blue Six and Naked Music. Still, I'm very pleased with this purchase."
4,very good purchase experience,"Fast, book is in readable condition. Price was WAAAAYYYY cheaper than ANYTHING else listed online. I'm thoroughly satisfied w/ my purchase."
2,Polaroid Under the Cabinet TV,"I enjoyed the unit while it worked. The warranty is 90 days and the LCD screen stopped working at about 112 days. Polaroid had no flexibility on the issue. They charged $60 to exchange the unit for a new one (which I don't have yet, but that's not a gripe). No discussion or communication with Polaroid would change their mind. I'm very dissappointed in the product reliability, and at Polaroid's indifference. This unit is not cheap. Take the money and find another more reliable brand."
5,:aynes 4Runner manual,The book was listed as being used but when it arrived it was brand new. It shipped and arrived when promised. I would definitely buy from this seller again.
5,Toyota Xtracab manual,"The book was great as I used to own a Toyota Xtracab. Sadly, it finally died after 18 years of service. I bought a used Toyota RAV4 last year, but ""strangely enough"" I have not been able to find an inexpensive manual for the RAV4. It appears that the current manuals are expensive shop manuals. I get the feeling that the manufacturers are making cars more complex so even a simple oil and lube change are now beyond a handyman."
4,Haynes is always good,A good supplement to the factory manual. Could get by with this alone for many things.
1,toyo manual,"This is not a reflection on the seller, but Chilton manuals in general SUCK! If you really want a good manual buy a Benchley."
5,Informative,Easy to follow instructions. Any person new to automotive repair will like using this guide. I highly recommend you have this manual in your garage.
3,Okay for what it is.,"I was looking for a better wireing diagrame, but felt this book left a lot to be desired. I guess a shop manual is what I really need. Good book for the basic stuff though."
4,Haynes no spec. on 4Y engines,"The Haynes manual has become an essential part of my garage, lot's of stuff is explained in a no-nonsense way so even us foreigners can understand. I bought my version when working in the U.S. some years ago. The only thing wrong with it (apart from those darn U.S. measurements) is that there is no info on the 2.2 litre 4Y gasoline engine that we have in Europe. Nevertheless the manual is still agreat co-mechanic/tutor."
3,Good for Basic Information,"I found a lot of the information useful in this manual, but it was lacking detail that would have made some of the repairs that I made easier. For example, when replacing my clutch fan on front of my engine, it did not mention that there was an access point at the bottom of the fan shroud. After a couple hours of fiddling with it from the top, I finally found that out by removing that single piece. It could have included an illustration or note that depicted that. Anyway, if you want more detail, I suggest a service manual from another source."
3,Middle of the road,"Pages were of the same type as newspaper, but a little thicker. Pages were easily marked up with grease, not able to wipe off. I was doing a clutch replacement, and was left guessing at some of the diagrams and pictures."
4,Pretty much what you would expect from any repair manual,Nothing amazing but has good descriptions and visuals for the do-it-your-self types. Definitely handy to have around for maintenance and from what I can tell would pretty much be helpful for all but the most complex repairs.
3,"Dated, but good enough",The photo's are black and white and poor quality but the information is good enough to get the job done.
3,Toyota confusion,"This is a pretty good book overall . The wiring diagrams are pretty vague, they refer to early and late model . They never say their definition of early or late model .I purchased the book hoping to figure out wiring problems , none of their diagrams matched my truck . I will use this book , but it didn't help to fix my truck."
5,The Simple Truth,"This book is soooooooooo great!It is everything I believe to be the way the world and it's people should be.It's the simple truth.I am recommending it to everyone.Stephanie SellAllentown,PA"
4,^.^,"Clover seems to be one of CLAMP's lesser known works, but I find it to be one of their better works. The story is interestig and presented in an appealing way through beautiful art. As with most of most of CLAMP's manga, Clover includes interesting character relationships, including a gay couple(one partner being much older than the other)so if you're not into that sort of thing you should probobly stay away from this manga(or CLAMP in general, as most of their works contain controversial relationships). Clover is a futuristic fantasy filled with emotion centered around a few psychic youths who are feared and restrained by the government for fear of their powers. There is a good deal of action but more than that it is a character-driven emotional drama. The first two volumes are one complete story, the third is a prequel, and the fourth is a prequel to the prequel. All in all The characters, story, and art make it a great read."
5,Gorgeous,"CLAMP has done it again. I love this manga. Too bad it's so short! I'm still trying to get #3, and it's driving me batty, because the story is so addicting that you just have to know what happens, but you don't want to skip ahead and read #4! It's so gorgeous, I recommend it to anyone who likes anime. Especially if you like X or any of the darker CLAMP mangas."
4,Great Chair.,"Very sturdy chair, just right for someone who needs a little more extra space. There are cheaper versions of this chair out there but they don't compare to this one. Very comfortable. Used for camping, the black does show dust/dirt a little more than a lighter color would, overall a very nice chair. Would purchase again.If you are purchasing this chair for a bad back then consider that this chair is a little heavy to move around due to it's sturdy construction, but worth the effort."
2,Fairies bookplates,"i'm sorry, but for the most part, these are the ugliest fairies i've ever seen! i bought these for my daughter who loves fairies and she wasn't impressed either. i also bought the butterflies and women reading. those are very pretty. but the fairies need to flutter off somewhere!"
4,"Some Great '60s-'70s Pop, Some Filler","For this 50-something listener, Hollies' peak represented by 'Bus Stop', Carrie Anne,' and 'He Ain't Heavy' is pure pleasure. But some of the other '60s songs on this comprehensive compilation sound dated or like pale imitations of better British bands of the era.Probably better off getting a leaner album with just their best songs. And at their best, the Hollies were sublime. Allen Clark, Tony Hicks and of course Graham Nash all contributed to a great pop sound."
4,Really brings back some memories,"this was a great album. I really love the music of this era, its very, very, very, very good! Thanks."
3,The very best of bubblegum,"And that pretty well says it. Some US top 40 Hollies tunes, and much never heard before this side of the pond, but all in all a pretty good Hollies retrospective."
4,"Only book I used, and I passed!","This is the only book I used to study for the E-commerce exam and I passed with an 85 percent. I think it is very adequate for the exam, but perhaps has some extra material (like Actinic Businees and so forth) that you do not need to know.This book can be a bit confusing, so I recommend that you do all the questions in the book and also all the practice questions on the CD.Here's what I did: the two nights before the exam, I reviewed every single chapter's pre-test as well as the chapter reviews and the questions at the end of the chapter. I also read all of the exam tips in each chapter (these are life savers for the exam). Make sure you do this!The night before the exam I took three out of four tests from the CD. I recommend if you have the time and are confused to do all these tests and to go over them an additional time. This process will help you focus on the priorities for the exam. Best of luck on the exam!"
5,Perfect for the smaller guys...,"I've had my fair share of searching for one that fits and won't slip off. This condom is perfect for guys shorter than 5"". Let's keep on making love, not war!"
3,I don't give myself enough credit with size,I'm sure it's a great product but I couldn't get these on. The name says it all. I thought they would be tighter as to feel like nothing is there but make sure you need these before you buy. Don't sell yourself short like I did.
3,Whoa!,"Do not buy these unless you are asian..or 12. These things are tiny. They are supertight and the other reviews about how snug they are, are fully correct. I had to use extra lube to get one of these suckers on and it was making me turn white from lack of circulation. I feel if there is any air in the tip you will bust it wide open when you get up to speed. Made for 3"" or below."
3,Ouch,"I'm not the biggest guy and all and these still were way to tight. Started to cut off bloodflow. Didn't go al ll the way down the shaft. But still useful, I guess, if you like a litttle pain"
3,good but a little tight,"It is what it is. Works fine. My girl friend likes it. She told me that it has less friction. For me, it is a little small and difficult to put on. I'm 5'10"" and it is still small for me."
5,happiness is... this book!,"This is a great book to help you appreciate the little things in life. Snoopy and the rest of the Peanuts gang have knowledge the rest of us seem to forget as we grow older, and grow up. Recommended for anyone needing a little boost!"
5,"For all of us working scientists, Beaker is a hero and an inspiration",And this is a rather nice Beaker muppet figure for display. Mine is proudly placed right over the front entranceway inside my home. No one can enter without passing under Beaker and his fabulous green lab coat.
3,Bibliographical Access in India Today,"This book is a real piece of research, and deserves to be placed as a reference tool along with any social sceince collection.Researchers will find paths for further study.Students in LIS will find illustrations of content management in traditional social science libraries.Internet librarians can improve this study to show India's place in the emerging information society."
1,You CAN put this book down.,"I am not a voracious reader, but I do read a fair amount, and I can honestly say this is the worst book I've ever read. It took me a year to get through it, and I did so only to say that I finally got through the book. The plot wanders and is improbable at best. The book has no redeeming features, no characters are well developed and the story line is neither believable nor well developed. The only reason to read this book would be to add a new ""worst book"" to your personal list."
4,"A little confusing at points, but fascinating and fun.","This title came up on my Instant Recommendations, and I decided to give it a try after reading the reviews.It proved to be a throughly fascinating and entertaining read about human interactions and motivations. My only carp is that there's so much switching of viewpoints it got a little confusing about what was going on at a few points!But I won't call that a fatal problem by any means. All together this is a very good novel."
2,Do Not Read This Book,"... unless you really want to. And you better have good reasons in that case. I can't imagine what they could be though. If you want to ponder, circa 1988, the problems facing U.S. cities, or terrorism, or conspiracy, you'll not find anything much here. This is Franzen's first book, written 13 years before the materpice The Corrections (which is why you're considering this one, right?), and the kid had not yet assembled his talents nor adequately honed his intelligence. Rather than itemize its marginal successes against it's tedious failures, I'm gonna streamline for you: the only reason to give this a workout is to see how much the author, as a storyteller, truthteller, character-meister, has developed since. And that endevour is one of research. Read The Corrections again instead. Seriously."
2,murky narrative,"After reading The Corrections, I was ready to jump on the Franzen train, to buy all books that he has ever written and devour all of them. The Corrections was one of my favorite books ever. This one, however, is a quagmire. I was stuck reading an uninspired newsreel for weeks, with too many characters, dry narration, and uncomfortable racism infused paragraphs. Really dissapointing."
3,St. Louis never saw so much drama,"Yeah this book was OK, definitely could see Franzen's ""Corrections""-style of writing warming up in this overdone tale of civic corruption and urban discontent. Haling from St. Louis originally, however, I was constantly reminded at the outrageously fictitious nature of this story--STL doesn't see this kind of drama. Too many characters sacrfice any decent character development, other than maybe the protaganist, Martin Probst. Good summer reading if you're not expecting too much. You could do a hell of a lot worse than ""Twenty-Seventh City."""
4,Good Pomo Mystery,"Franzen is a great talent, although Strong Motion, his other novel, is a better, more complex book. The basic plot revolves around Jammu, an Indian law-woman who is made police chief of St. Louis. The mystery side of the book is largely pedestrian. What is interesting is the way the Franzen weaves in the theme of suburban seperation from the inner-city. This theme is quite prescient given recent thought-media coverage of emergent suburban ""pods"" (see Atlantic Monthly Aug. 1998 for details). This book is ultimate vacation reading for post-modern elitist types."
2,zzzzz...,"Well I'll admit that I only read half of it, but I kept it around for a few months, thinking I SHOULD like it. Finally I gave it to the Salvation Army.Parts of it were fine, and there were some good characterizations (as another reader said); particularly the teenage girl and her folks living that white, UpperMiddleclass life. Franzen renders hum-drumness with amusing accuracy.But the political intrigue was hardly intriguing. It put me to sleep. Literally. I found myself skimming and skipping, then I just gave up.I like Franzen's essays, and I'm a fan of the crowd he runs with (DFWallace and co.), so this isn't the opinion of someone 'outside' the 90's writing thang. I get it. I just want to warn anyone thinking of buying this book to perhaps try another (will amazon really print this? Not that they shouldn't buy ANY books, just not this particular one!)"
2,Not Worth It - Try Another Novel Instead,"Jonathan Franzen is an accomplished writer. However, that doesn't stop this book from being a clunker. Having started and stopped several times, I finally got stuck at page 215 and have not had the energy or willpower to go further. His plot is bizarre and the characters arouse little sympathy; the prose does little to propel you on. I would recommend The Corrections for anyone intrigued by his style but unwilling to take a chance on this early poorly-received work of his."
2,I'm confused,"I read The Corrections, so I was looking forward to reading this. I've persisted 3/4 the way through the book and am finally abandoning it. I can't keep track of how all of the characters inter-relate. Of the few key characters, the Indian sidekick Singh is just not believable at all esp the relationship he has with the protagonist's wife. Some interesting writing, different perspectives of viewing some things, but not enough to make up for the incomprehensibility of the book."
3,Very good,"This is a fun and quietly zany book about a host of political players caught up in a one-horse conspiracy to rezone the city - for vast real-estate profits - and the vain fledgling counter-conspiracy that springs up to try to stop it. A great soup of quirky, convincing characters who continuously flavor one other's actions and motives.I loved the Corrections and the writing here is similar, if not nearly identical in tone, style and purpose. But where his later smash hit was about small circumstances and grand themes, ""The Twenty-Seventh City"" is about supposedly soaring politicos and the mundane goals they fight for with all their might. The great farce of ""The Twenty-Seventh City"" - if you want to look at that way - is that for all their outsized and often self-imposed importance, these characters end up really going nowhere, achieving nothing."
3,"Over-reached, did run out of gas","I read The Corrections first (which I think is his best), Freedom (a close second) and then I picked this up, impressed by the first two I read. This starts out to be super, but there is no way to tie all the strings together and finish out the charactershe has painfully and descriptively developed. The ending doesn't make total sense, there is no feeling whatsoever of closure, and the story line of Barbara's murder at the same time as the Probst mansion burning to the ground is totally not believeable-really a reach. It does jump around a lot and you don't know who you are reading about until well into the sub-chapter. If you love Franzen, you might like this to compare his earlier style, but as a stand alone, it is just OK."
4,Perceptive novel,"This is a pretty perceptive novel, it takes swipes on our unfettered faith in capitalism, and free-market theories. Most of the characters introduced in the novel are likeable, flawed, and consequently interesting. The plot is a bit hazy, but it's an engaging commentary about the times we live in. Do give it a go- I found it to be an entertaining piece of work to lose myself in."
2,Pretty bad,"I loved the Corrections so I picked this book up. It's ambition was admirable, but I have to pretty much agree with the previous reviewer- it was nearly unreadable."
3,"intriguing, yet hard to follow","I picked up this novel with great interest, due to the fact that I am very familiar with the St. Louis area. The descriptions of the city were right on, however, the relationships of the characters became very muddled as the novel went on. Also, of what did the mystery consist?"
4,Well done first novel,"I thoroughly enjoyed Jonathan Franzen's first novel about his home town of St. Louis. The fabulously corrupt S. Jammu is a well drawn character. One only wishes there were more of her in the novel and fewer dreary boardroom scenes. I confess that the technical talk about real estate, stock values, etc, was a bit over my head. Franzen is a master of character development. I especially enjoyed the scenes told from the perspective of the philandering Rolf Ripley. Also excellent: the paranoid General Norris, particularly in his activities with Pokorny, his hired P.I. This book does seem to drag a bit in the middle, but the last fifty pages were thrilling. As a native of Buffalo, NY, another failing urban area, I was interested in reading about another second rate city and it's problems."
1,Don't Bother,"As an avid reader and a fan of ""The Corrections,"" I had much higher expectations for this novel. I found it very difficult to get into, in fact, I had to read the first 30 pages twice to have a clue as to what was happening. I found that the story dragged on and was exceedingly unrealistic, especially towards the end. I am not even sure I fully understood the conclusion because the story became so convoluted. I purchased ""The Twenty-Seventh City"" in combination with ""Strong Motion"" from amazon.com and this book turned me off so much to Franzen's writing that I doubt that I will even read ""Strong Motion."" I think Franzen really missed the mark with this one."
2,Competent for what it is,"Franzen's first novel, like his others, are competent page-turners, if often a bit long-winded--essentially mass-market paperback airplane reading material in the guise of neo-Delillo Literary Fiction. Franzen's gotten some good breaks in the press with the help of supportive publishers, editors, agents, and others. Which is also why the media hype surrounding him is spin, and he falls far short of the two writers he seems to most wish to be--Fitzgerald and Delillo--though if you compare him with his true peers, the Robert Ludlams, etc., he's a captivating read. Just don't read too much into it (pun intended)--it's not there."
3,"Enjoyable, if you know the City and have a global perspectiv","Hey, this was a decent read. It gave an interesting look at what IS a high stakes game--the redevelopment and reinvigoration of a dying city. Franzen's strange choice of a female protagonist, and his knowledge of the St Louis metro-region, make it an enjoyable read.The biggest disappointment is Franzen's recurring gratuitous sexual blurbs."
3,Runs out of gas,"Franzen constructs an intricate and interesting narrative. Unfortunately, that only gets him within 150 pages of the novel's end. The pat ending is supposed to reflect the chaos of wildly opposing forces all coming head-to-head. Instead, it comes across as an author's attempt to bring closure to a story that he hadn't fully plotted out and didn't know how to end."
2,Too long and what was the point?,"I loved The Corrections. This book, however, had too much unneccesary dialogue and too many accounts of meetings that did not really advance the plot and were often tedious to read. I didn't really understand the motivation for the conspiracy led by Jammu - I didn't see how the illegal actions would have benefited her and have been worth all the effort she and others put in, maybe I missed something. I enjoy conspiracy-theory plots and thrillers, but after a while I just wanted to finish the book so I could figure out why the conspirators were doing all these terrible things. The idea behind it was interesting, but when I got to the end I felt like I had missed the entire point of the book and was disappointed. It also seemed a bit racist to me as well, considering that most of the evil corrupt characters in the book were Indian."
2,Messy,"There are snippets here of the writer Franzen was to become with The Corrections, but ultimately, this is a mess. Ambitious, sweeping, blah blah blah. Also, too packed with minor characters that have no bearing on the plot -- and have too little effect on the main characters to be worth the effort. I'm willing to do a little work when I read a book, especially something that aspires in the way this one does, but rein it in a bit, man. Reminiscent in reach of Zadie Smith's White Teeth -- another rambler that at least had some likable characters."
4,Great Franzen work!,"Franzen's best work has been Freedom. This is my second favorite book of his. A mysterious plot, local to St Louis, without the randomness found in The Corrections. Written a while back, but relevant to the city of St Louis today, this is a page turner, and a must-read!"
2,Skip this one,"Contrary to most products made by Arc'teryx, these shorts are not well designed. The pockets are hard to access, the legs don't move freely (no gusseted crotch area). I recommend looking at shorts made by Prana. In the area of men's shorts, Arc'teryx products are quite disappointing."
5,These are my favorite,I use the bags for organizing small things as well as storing food. They are durable and the zipper works smoothly. I would hate to live without my zipper bags.
2,It's a joke,"I have no idea what those other reviews where talking about. yes I did hook this amp up and got decent performance but nothing like what they said. I have two 12 type alpine X speakers and I hooked the pyles amp to them and it wasn't as bad as I thought it would have been. I also had a alpine 450 true watt amp that I switched out and compared to the pyles. The alpine without a doubt out performed the pyles. Then I bridged the pyles and compared. The pyles did out perform the alpine....when it didn't cut off...which happened constantly until it blew. Now I have the alpine in there doing the same performence and hasn't blown. Listen to me and just buy a lower wattage, better brand amp. Don't waste your money on this piece of junk."
1,warning,"I received this item for Christmas and it only worked for a few months before the screen went black. I called polaroid and they basically said Too bad the warranty is up (90 days!), but for $110. we can replace it.....what so that it can happen again after another few months. I took it to a repair shop (mind you it worked for only 6 months maybe) and they said it needed a new display assembly board but polaroid does not/will not sell internal repair parts. What a waste of money!! We replaced it with a Sony they have a much better warranty. We will NEVER buy from Polaroid again. Who expects a 90 warranty on a television, I expected Polaroid to back their product better than this."
1,Netscape 6.0 book not worth the price,"I have purchased this book used and I must say it's very disappointing. It is more geared for a novice , first time Netscape user rather than someone who has been using Netscape and upgraded the software. IF you can find anything from IDG books or Maran books buy that !! I cannot recommend this book for those who need solutions however I can recommend it to those who need first time, novice help!"
5,NLT BIBLE SPEAKS TO THE HEART,"I love this translation. I have nothing against the other translations, and Christians can certainly choose the one they like. However, I don't believe in one being superior to another. God's word was meant to be understood by people. I got caught up in the King James Only movement, and tried hard to read it. I still believe it is great, but there were passages that totally confused me. THE NEW LIVING TRANSLATION IS SO CLEAR THAT I FEEL AS IF IT WERE TALKING TO ME!! I used to dread Bible reading, now I can't wait to open it up. I own several versions, but this is my favorite. It's clear and pretty accurate. I compare passages with those in my other translations. The differences are not significant, other than I can understand the NLT. Every Christian should own a NLT. Even if you prefer another translation (which is fine), the NLT can help clear up some of the more difficult passages found in the more literal Bibles."
4,REEBOK HIGH TOP SNEAKERS,"Too narrow so I had to have them stretched but, otherwise, fits perfectly. Very comfortable."
3,Reasonable Ankle Support,"Bought these sneakers as I completely tore the ligaments in my ankle 6 months ago and my ankle still needs lots of support. Together with a brace these sneakers work well to stop me going over on the ankle, but they are definitely not the most comfortable sneakers to wear, as some people have surprisingly said, for the following reasons:- They are the narrowest, for a medium fitting, shoes that I have ever bought (and I have reasonably narrow feet). There is absolutely no arch support and the toe box is very tight. I'll wear them whilst my ankle still needs the support but really, for comfort and the sake of the rest of my foot, I can't wait to get back to my Merrells and Keens!"
4,Hi Tops,"I like these shoes because I have weak ankles and they help support them. I like the the flexibility of shoe, easy to walk in. I have one complaint and it is that they are too narrow. I wish they were wider. They don't come in a wide width."
5,Great Shoe!!,"Got these for my mom. Can't believe how hard they are to find in the store. She loves them. Great ankle support, comfortable and a classic style. Can't go wrong."
1,disaster purchase,this purchase turned into a disaster because Bealls sent me the shoes with a security device fastened to them necessitating having to immediately send them back to Bealls for removal and increasing the cost of the postage which did not make them a good buy at that point. I returned them and will not order from this company again.
3,beautiful classic shoes,"this shoes are beautiful and great quality but its small shape, i expected it to be a little bigger and couldnt fit even though its my size. should have published the internal measures by size to save some trouble. good thing is they fit perfectly to my sister :)"
3,Shoes were just too small...Didn't have my size.,The only problem with the product was the shoes were too small. They didn't have my needed size and I went ahead and got the refund.
5,Charlie Allen is what Country Music is all about,"I'm not a Country Music fan per se, but Charlie Allen could make country music fans out of anyone! I've seen Charlie perform live in Daytona Beach and his singing and guitar playing are matched only by his sincerity and down home nature. His mellow songs are fantastic, but I love his lively songs, too. If I had to pick my favorite it would have to be ""Once in a While"" cause I could listen to that over and over again. This is one heck of an album and I'm buying more to give to friends and family!"
2,Video quality is so poor--sound is uneven and distracting,"Before I purchased this video I read the customer comments. One of the remarks was how inferior the quality of the video was. I should have listened. What a waste of my money. As much as I have enjoyed Lilias over the years, the quality needs to improve before I would purchase another video."
3,To long,"Well built step. Only real complaint is the step bar should have multiple holes for the reciever hitch to line up.

5,Well Written Regency Mystery,"The Thief Taker is a well-written and complex mystery full of well-developed characters set in Regency London.When Halbert Glendinning arrives at a party apparently dead from asphyxiation Henry Morton, a Bow Street Runner, is called to the scene when someone feels that there is something strange in Glendinning death. His search leads him on an inquiry into the upper circles of London society. Morton follows is a complex and strange path before finding the truth behind Glendinning's death.The Thief Taker is the first book in a series that contains only 2 books. It is a shame because the series and the premise has great possibilities. I always hate it when good series does not sell well enough to continue. It would be nice but not likely if the authors could find another publisher to continue the series."
5,An interesting historical mystery,"This historical mystery is set in 1815. Henry Morton is a Bow Street Runner (a.k.a. cop) who works with his mistress to solve both a murder and a theft. Most of Morton's problems stem from the ""thief taking"" system in place at the time, and the world-building of the historical time period is excellent.The pacing was good, and the characters and mystery were interesting. For those who care, all of the sex occured 'off page.'Genre Reviewshttp://genrereviews.blogspot.com/"
3,Good but not great,"The table is definitely large enough for 7 players and a dealer, and the padding is good for dealing cards.The one area of concern was the overall construction quality. The chip tray was loose in the table (I had to re-attach it), and more importantly, the table legs were not mounted well to the underside of the table. Pulling open one of the legs actually pulled the attachment plate and screws out of the table. To fix it I had to re-drill the plate and the table and use 3/4 inch screws, not the 1/2 inch ones originally used.One other point: the description shows cup holder slots but the table doesn't have them. Misleading description and picture.Overall, not a bad table for the money, but the construction quality is a little weak. It's fixable but shouldn't have to be."
2,Not tall enough,"You can only deal sitting down. This is not advertised. The legs are too short. The table size is regulation, but the height is not."
4,Baracuda standard case,"I wear Barracuda standard goggles 5 days a week for swimming and have for several years. So as not to make impressions in the material used in the goggles, I have started using this case. It seems to work well. Rather than throwing the goggles in my bag, I use the case for protection. It is a good investment if you wear Barracuda standard goggles, but other suction type goggles don't need something this big."
5,May Sailor Moon Live in Our Hearts For Eternity...,"The greatest series of all time, Naoko Takeuchi's Pretty Solider Sailor Moon's, final book has finally been put in English. It was extremely good *I've only owned it for two weeks, and I already have it memorized!*, but also very sad (it had me crying during SSR in school). But, I must say, if Sailor Moon had to end, Naoko couldn't have written it better. The story of Sailor Moon has been put to rest, but it's legend will live on for eternity... **Keep the Moonie Pride Alive!**"
5,at last,"Let me be honest, I love to see Serena in Darien's bed, wow, It's very nice to see that they had some time together at last."
4,it was kind of confusing..,"i mean, of course all the translations are confusing but...I mean, seriously out of all the ones I've read (2, 4,5,7,18) i think this is the second best. I like 5 too....But overall, this is cool especially the end, where they get together again. And doesn't it seem kind of weird that they mixed up the attacks with galactica? it's not right."
4,Very Beatiful...yet sad,"I loved this book very much...one of my aboslute favoritesThe artwork was much better in the stars, and it shows more of it's greatness in this manga.It was so sad though...it had a very confusing ending too, but it's very good anyway...I wish there was an explanation on where did Kakyuu and the starlight went, same with the cats, I mean, where in the world are they? Suppose they reincarnated back on their homeplanet, but i still wish there was a bit more stuff about them, and not all about Mamoru and Usagi's wedding.But you should still read this book, buy it now...it's one of the best!"
4,A sad girl,"I'm a girl who loved sailor Moon! I really did! I used to watch all the movies and shows when I was little.I loved to act out the scenes and would come home and flop down in front of the tv to watch Sailor Moon.One day,I came home to watch Sailor Moon but it wasn't on.I thought it would be on tomorrow but not tomorrow or the next day or the nest day.I was so heart broken.My favorite tv show,and they cancelled it and it wouldn't come on.I was just crying the practiclly all the time.Now I'm 12 years old and at that time I was 5,I really still miss Sailor Moon and hope to see it.I just watch the 1 video I have and it brings back memories.I really miss it......"
4,This book is the best!!!!,"The illustrations of this, Naoko Takeuchi's last Sailor Moon manga, are amazing. I couldn't wait for this book to get out so I got the book in French and japanese. In the book Princess Kakyu transforms into Sailor Kinmoku. She then kills one of the garden Senshi, I can't remember which one. The remaining one then stabs her with her staff. Sailor Chibi Chibi also transforms, into Sailor Cosmos."
1,sailormoons kids stuff!!!,"all i want to say is that i regret when i ever bought ANY sailor moon manga. Its very bad for the younger crowd and pretty boring for the older ones. Naoko might be a good artist, but she's definitly not a good story writer. The stort repeats its self five or six times through out all the sailormoon manga series. The pictures get worse and worse every time and the plot gets really ruined, (ESPECIALY at the last few pages in the last book [its terrible!!]). Smaller kids might enjoy it though its very bad for them (I wouldn't recommend it for ANY parent to let their kids read these things). The author, Naoko, might've done a good job at the begining, but she DEFINITLY over did it and ruined it in the end! For those who are just so impressed by SailorMoon (anime or manga), believe me, i've been through that phase and do regret it a lot now. Not recommended at all!"
4,The end of the sailor moon trilogy,Sadly this is the end of the sailor moon graphic novels (at least best to my knowledge) This book was so good until you get to the end where you may have to read a few times before you get it (i've read it many times and i still don't get it!!!)
5,Sailor Moon Stars #3,"This is the best manga ever. It is the last manga in the Bishojou Senshi Sailormoon series. If you dare to say different, take it up with ME!"
5,I Love This Book!,"Stephen Cary has written a wonderful book for teachers of English Learners as well as for native English Speakers in the process of expanding their language.Cary's years of teaching and learning language acquisition theory and practice as well as his love of children and wonderful sense of humor have helped to create a terrific teaching aid. New and experienced teachers will find a great deal to inspire and encourage them. The book is full of real teaching experience. I have seen him teach and the students are instantly responsive and engaged, while being immersed in using rich language. He is an inspiring teacher and his experiences and humor have created an inspiring and easily accessible book. It is practical and easy to use. You too, will love this book!"
3,An essential guide,A informative and interesting read for any who needs to prep for firefighter exam
2,Feng Shui for Gardens,"The basic ideas in this book are good and the illustrations are great. However several subjects were lacking complete explaination and left me thinking I had missed something. The biggest disappointment for me though was the over-use of the work auspicious. By the end of the second chapter I caught myself counting how many times that word appeared on one page. I realize the word auspicious is a very powerful word, but in a 217 page book that word appears at least once on every page or at least it sure seemed so? I don't think I will be able to get past this and probably will return the book for another selection by a different author."
2,Feng Shui For Garden,"Book described as new but it looks old with 2 different colors. The border of the page is yellow (may expose in sun light) and inside is white. Moreover, it has a few of underlined footnotes in blue ink. I decided to keep the book because it's not worth to return it (just wasting time and money)."
1,Amazon fell down on this one,"Cannot rate the product, because it arrived nearly 2 weeks after my vacation, which was 3 weeks after Amazon (verbally) and their trucking company (verbally) promised it would be delivered.Amazon could not cancel or change the order the night it was placed, because it was ""shipped"". ""But don't worry, it will absolutely be there on time"".Trucking company could not track the order for days, because they had ""not yet received it from Amazon"". ""But don't worry, we'll get it to you 2 days after we receive it.""When all was said an done, nobody followed through and it nearly ruined our family trip. (Found the only similar item in stock at a local store, the day before vacation.)Amazon delivery commitment trust value is way down in my book.No restitution from anyone!"
4,Good Overview & Useful Tips,I enjoyed reading this book. It was a good overview of Sony Vegas 6 and its capabilites. The tips and examples provided were interesting and useful. I would have liked to see detailed handling of topics like color correction and other more advanced techniques. I would recommend this book to anyone who wanted to get a general feel for what Sony Vegas 6 can do and how to do it. One note: There is a reference in the book to downloadable files - but these didn't exist. I e-mailed the author to find out how to get the files. I received an e-mail that he was screening e-mail and I explained what I was e-mailing about. The author never bothered to respond to my request. Disappointing behavior...but the book makes up for it. ;)
3,"Sony Vegas 6 ""Official Guide""","I had trouble finding a good reference guide for Sony Vegas Movie Studio 9. I picked this up hoping it would help. Some information is applicable, but as a beginner's guide, it falls short. I ended up purchasing the video training published by VASST. Costs more, but worth it."
2,not a good buy,"I bought this for my 4 y/o in hopes he would enjoy making sand trucks and then crushing them with his creations. Unfortunately, even though he loves trucks, he was disinterested in anything this set had to offer except the sand itself! The set does not come with a sand box or carrying case to keep the toys in so most of the contents of the set cannot be carried together. I would not recommend this to anyone expecting a set such as the Farm Moon Sand Set."
5,MY SON LOVES THIS TOY!,"This is one of the best toys for my son, who is three. He will play with it for 1-2 hours at a stretch. He plays independently for long stretches, which is nice. I set it up on the kitchen table on a large cookie sheet to help contain the mess. I will definately be buying more Moon Sand in the future. Beware that is does make a bit of a mess, some usually ends up on the floor, but can be easily swept up at the end of playtime. It does stick to clothes, so I actually have one outfit my son wears when he plays with moon sand. I keep the outfit with the moon sand, so we just quickly change clothes. My son LOVES moon sand. For the amount of time he plays with it, it is worth the small amount of clean-up."
3,"Figures blah, floor and chairs yea!","The Jedi Council sets suffer from weak figure and sculpt choices for previously issued characters. It also is confusing in that it is a cross between the Episode I and Episode II Jedi councils. Now there are some unique characters that haven't been offered in any other setting as well now reduced to only Depa Bilpa and Opo Ranciss. Considering that most of these other figures are now considered Super Articulated you could get by getting the a set of six floors and their chairs to make the council chamber and fill them with better figures for the most part.However the figures aren't the ""star"" of this set as much as the council chamber is. While the color is inaccurate it does the job well enough for display provided you have a fairly deep shelf (18""or so), but it won't fall or drop if only 12"" deep."
2,NASTY if you must communicate with them.,"I gave them two addresses: our Amazon shipping address AND our mailing address ATTACHED to my order. They blamed me because they got it wrong; said I was ""bitching"" about their error.OK . . . I'll give them two stars for promptly shipping to the wrong place."
1,Keyless Keypad,As previously stated would not work with my new liftmaster opener and the company that sold it was uncooperative in my opinion.
5,Perfect Solution,"Guest needed access to home through our garage and using our remote device in the vehicle was not working out well - not always replaced, a little bulky to carry, etc. Since the cost of this product was less than another remote, that it would provide me with ability to close garage while working outside, that it was easy to install and program, it became a great solution to a potentially complex problem - treating guest with respect while still being able to open garage door with great easy."
2,Not Very Dependable,"I've had the Model 377LM for about 4 years now starting on a new house. Not any issues to speak of until about a year or two into it.However, I now have to enter my code anywhere from 2 to 5 times before the door will open. I've tried changing batteries and codes in different combinations only to have the inconsistency return after a time. My neighbor has the exact same system and experiences the exact problem. His unit is now to the point where you spend a good minute entering and re-entering the code before the door opens - extremely frustrating.In my opinion, this remote keypad needs a design update to improve the reliability of the button entry.Based on my experience with this keypad, I would NOT recommend it. It is just not reliable enough over the long run."
5,Easy! Easy! Easy!,"I used this unit on a Chamberlain 3/4 HP Chain drive opener (M#248735) that I purchased at Lowes. Make sure you have the right model for your garage door opener using the Chamberlain web site.Installation is easy and programming was even easier. You don't even need to get out the ladder and touch the program button on the opener! Type in your code, hold down the enter button, the light button and door button on your door control.The packaging is easy to open unlike the models sold in Big Box stores that come in bombproof and shoplifter resistant clamshells.Quick shipping and a good price from bigdoorguy."
5,Liftmaster Garage Door Opener,Very fast service - item arrived exactly as was described in much shorter time than quoted - in perfect condition. I messed up on the model to order - without delay he exchanged my unit with no hassle. A true professional that you can TRUST to do business with. Way to go!!!
3,"Works well, Cheap plastic.",This remote works well and the buttons have a good solid feel to them. I'm dissapointed in the cheapness of the plastic case. The hinges on the cover have already broken and now it (the cover) no longer opens and closes properly. I'd give it a five except for that.
5,"Great opener, easy to program and use","Before you order this product make sure your door opener has a purple learn button. The keypad arrived within 5 days of my order. Well packed. Very easy to program, after reading instructions it should take no more than 5 minutes to do it. Comes with battery installed and ready to go. Attaches with 2 screws (included), just be sure to pop the battery cover off to get at the bottom mounting screw hole (keypad slides over top mounting screw). Pleased with seller and the product."
4,Takes two presses,"This installed and set up very easily, but for some reason, after entering the code, you have to press enter twice to get it to either open or close the door. From what i can tell, i should only have to press it once."
1,Poor Customer Support,"The Unit did not function property - and the ""bigdoorguy"" did not stand behind the product 2 weeks after purchase."
5,Works,As advertised the unit works like a charm. Easy to program and install. The one button close is so much nicer than the old remote we had.
5,pad,"This pad was very easy to set up.The instructions were clear, it is impossible to mess up with the installation (I am not even good with tools, but if you cannot do that, you probably should not do anything at all)The pad picked up the signal right away. Overall it took less than 5 minutes to screw the pad onto the garage frame and to set up the code.We have owned this pad for over 2 years and never had a problem, did not even need to change the batteries.Very satisfied."
3,"Good price, flimsey","This unit works well and was easy to program. The 3 stars was for the door design. I cannot imagine how this could have possible passed inspection. It came off 10 seconds after opening the box. Near as I can tell, its designed to just fall off. Stupid. I liked the opener well enough to keep it anyway and have a screw on one side to keep it on."
5,"Fast, Easy, and Works like a champ.",I have now installed some 5 of these in my neighborhood and it now takes about 10 minutes from start to finish and it always works perfectly. Excellent for folks who want to go next door or outside with garage door shut and don't want to carry a gob of keys in their pocket or keep one under a rock.
1,Didn't work,"So followed instructions it is suppose to be the correct one but no matter what any one tried it would not work, have to figure out how to return it now, hopefully can get a refund. Never have had to return something before. Very Sad"
5,Perfect Size,Looks good and works well. Easy to program. Small enough to be somewhat inconspicuous but large enough to find. Buttons are a nice size.
5,Fantastic,We needed a way in using the garage the Liftmaster 377LM315MHz is our life saver. The product was shipped fast and was very easy to install. From start to finish installation took 10 mins. Once installed easy programing and use. Fantastic!!
5,Great product!!,Find the product works exactly as advertised. Very pleased. I find myself using it much more than I thought I would.
5,Great Product. Fast and Easy Installation.,"I had some apprehension about installation and coordinating the opener codes with the garage door opener. It turned out to be something a child could do. I just pressed the purple (yes, it must be purple) learning button on the back of my garage door opener, pressed the button on the keypad opener and it immediately started working. Highly recommended."
5,"Easy to install, works great","This is the exact model that the builder offered as an option, but much cheaper than builder's price. It took me about 10 min to program and install. Works great! Don't have to carry keys all time anymore."
3,"Good company but doesnt work on ""Over Head Door"" opener","When the first Lift Master was lost in the U.S. mail... the company PROMPLY mailed me another - (very good on their behalf).. However, be advised - this opener DOES NOT open a ""OverHead Door"" Legacy CD/B door.. My door motor, has A ""learn"" button - but NOT a ""PURPLE"" learn button."
1,(Help Needed) Door Keypad wasn't working with my Liftmaster Garage opener,I got a liftmaster brand to make sure that it will work with my garage opener which is liftmaster brand as well.However it never worked and i have been trying to get help to fix or exchange it with right one or compatible one.Can you help me with this problem?Jin Cho
4,Does the job,easy to program ...works as described ... the mounting system could be a little more secure which was the reason it didn't get five stars...
4,"Remote worked, my idea didn't","I ordered 2 of these and they were delivered, on time and together. They both worked properly. I did return them as my idea for them wouldn't work. I wanted to leave them in vehicles that I sometimes have to park outside, so anyone breaking into the vehicle would be unable to merely push a button and open the garage. The problem is that only 1 at a time of the these keypads can be programmed to operate the same garage door opener. I would program one keypad opener and get it to work, but when I went to program the 2nd keypad opener for the same garage door it would work, but it would wipe out the first keypad code from working. I tried many different ways to do this and even asked the company for advice.I contacted the company fairly easily and told them of my situation. I was informed that my idea would not work. The company explained how I could return them and my account was credited, less the $10 restocking fee when they received them."
4,a CB for the space i have,I needed a small CB radio for my truck i have manual transmission a 5 speed i also have a ham radio a Alinco 220 radio i needed a small radio to go next to my 220 this one fit perfect more than satisfactory for my needs i will include a picture of my setup soon
5,Excellent,Worth every penny!! Durable light weight but yet stylish and compact. My Jeep wrangler has a very small cabin and noroom to put anything. This fits very easy in my center console.
4,Compact CB for my 08 Wrangler,"This is an excellent CB for the money. A fine piece of hardware, not cheap looking at all. I usually buy my products from Amazon but I found a ""Can't be beat CB Combo package"" at http://www.quadratec.com/products/96080_11.htm Combo included: CB, cable, antennae and antennae mount. The CB is compact, professional looking and LOUD, which is needed in a soft top jeep. Why didn't I give it 5 stars??? Nothing is perfect...."
2,Nope!,"As much as I like the Fall, their latest release is quite the disappointment. Filler is the word that comes to mind. After the first four songs (which are quite good, by the way...Reformation TLC being the stand-out), the material takes a deep plunge into mediocrity. Some of the songs are even dreadful (Das Boot, The Wright Stuff and the Insult Song come to mind in this regard). This CD should have been released as an EP. There is some point being made here, but I'm not quite sure what it is, nor do I care. At least you can't accuse MES of not being in character."
3,"Well, Sorta...","Mark E. Smith again proves his endearing quirkiness with this erratic album, something of a defiant statement after he broke up his last band. Rather murkily recorded and vague, the album meanders over various partially realized themes. The band certainly sounds good, with especially solid bass work. Eleni Poulou's song is certainly a standout, a breath of fresh air. However, Mark's in a sulk and wants everyone to know it, hence the droogish quality of his songs. It's listenable and worthwhile for Fallfans, but don't introduce anyone to the band's work with the CD (unless you want to scare them off)."
4,good product,The struts that I received were in perfect working order and have performed amazing since installing them. Price was great and pkg shipping was quick.
3,One Voice,"It was ""ok"" but if you really want a good show...buy ""The Concert"" but true fans will want it just for their collection..."
1,a bad purchase,"I was very disappointed when I could not play the DVD as it was not for our region.I did not know about the regions. Why would you ship a DVD that would not play in the U.S.? It was a big hassle. The US and Canada are region 1, which it did not include.I would appreciate a reply from you as to why you would do this.I will think real hard before I ever order again.Dennis Denton"
2,"Great Concert, lousey DVD!","I remember seeing this concert when it originally aired on HBO back in 1986. When I saw that it was available now on DVD from Amazon, I ordered it immediately. In light of my hectic travel schedule, I didn't open the DVD to watch this great show until 2 months later, only to discover that the copy I received would not play in my DVD player. When I placed the DVD in my laptop's DVD drive to confirm wheter or not it was my home DVD player or the DVD itself, I discovered that this DVD was not licensed for the U.S. region. My computer at least gave me the option of switching to the European regional classification, which I did. Most laptop's will only allow you to change regions for viewing up to 4 times, unless you have specific software that allows ongoing viewing for all international regional media classifications. My DVD player does not allow you to change regions, which means I can only watch this concert on my computer. Which sucks.Thank you Amazon."
4,A great concert in Barbra's back yard,"I was so happy this finally came out on DVD! One can tell Streisand was nervous even with all her celebrities friends, who paid $5000 to her Barbra belt out such songs as Over The Rainbow and Send in The Clowns. As the camera zooms in on Barbra as she sings ""Clowns"" it is such a rare, magical moment in song, from Streisand or any artist I have ever had the thrill to view. That song is worth the price of the DVD in of itself. One should never forget all of Barbra's proceeds goes to ""The Streisand Foundation"". So sit back and enjoy and feel good about making a small contribution to the foundation. One voice at a time the earth can rise to the music."
1,Won't play on any DVD player,I ordered the DVD as a Christmas present for my mom. When she placed it in the DVD player it said Region Error. Very disappointing. That wasn't disclosed in the original purchase. I would not order from CD IMPORTS ever again.
2,Had a problem with the DVD. Would not play on my DVD player because you needed a special Europen code which my player didn't hav,The vender should know about this and put that in the discription of the DVD.Always check before purchase made
5,Among the finest Christian novels I have ever read!,"Compelling, uplifting and utterly absorbing, this book must certainly have been inspired by God. It stands alone in a yet-to-be-determined class, and must, in time, surely be regarded as a classic. HIGHLY recommended for readers of all denominations - including unbelievers!"
5,Nice start,"This book is a good aid to parents trying to explain religion to a young child (3 years old and older), while letting them come to their own conclusions. The soft message is that God is every where, so you can always talk to Him and He will hear you. Very gentle appropriate to the subject matter. Great illustrations."
4,Add This to Your Witches Library,"This piece is very informative and gives a graphic representation through illustration & word into the world of Witches, Demons and Sorcerers and their Present Day Counterparts. Not intended for the ""Fluffy Bunnies"" or the ""Charmed Wanna-bes"".Although not as complete as it could be, and biased somewhat as the sources it is drawn from are not all ""Witch, Demonoligist, Sorcerer-& their viewpoint related"", this is still hands down one I would recommend to any ""must have"" list."
4,from a former student of Professor Robbins,"I had the good fortune to take several courses with Professor Robbins in his later years at Albany State (The University at Albany) in Albany, NY. By that time (around 1982), he was more jovial than rigorous, and would do things like bring a jug of wine to class, and tell stories about chasing Sybil Leek (and her messy bird) out of one town or another. His work is scholarly and authoritative, but I thought I should post that witchy wannabes might like to know that he was hardly pro-witch. He was a scholar, and seemed mostly to disdain the supernatural. It would seem to me that a good companion to this volume, if one is interested in RHR's viewpoint, would be _Witchcraft: An Introduction to the Literature of Witchcraft_ (Paperback), although I don't know anything about the title except that it appears here on amazon as a Robbins search item. I do of course have an autographed copy of this book!"
2,Don't Do it......,"Do not buy this sawmill. It will take at least a month for delivery. You will have to weld it when it gets there. It has no instructions. The VHS that they send you doesn't work. I would not sell this to a junk collector. I hope mine works when I put it together, after I find a welder....."
4,Excellent bag for small DSLR,"If you have an entry level DSLR, this is a great bag! It will hold an extra lens and flash in the main compartment. The top compartment can be use for small items like spared batteries and charger. However, for larger DSLR like a Canon 5D MKII or 7D, this bag is too small."
4,well built,Well built great pack but wish I would have gone for the next size up a little smaller then you would think.
5,Easy access to camera is a must!,"The reason I really like this camera bag is because it is very easy to access the camera. The sling style allows the bag to be slung around to the front of your body so that you can access the camera, lenses, or whatever else you have brought along with you. It is the perfect size for carrying the camera body, 2 lenses (it would be very tough to fit more than 2), camera manual, cords, charger, and extra battery. Some substitution could be done to fit an external flash in the bag, but there isn't much more room than that. The all-weather case that comes with the bag is an absolute must-have for inclement weather."
2,Nice bag...for a small camera,The bag is a very nice bag. The only problem is that my camera will not fit it with a 55-200mm lens connected to it. This is sad seeing as how the selling point is being able to take the camera out and being ready to shoot quickly. Unless you have a small digital camera - not a DSLR - I would go with something bigger.
5,"great bag, small and ultra portable","I tried out a bunch of other camera bags before purchasing the Lowepro for a ski trip. The bag fit perfectly and didn't shift around as I skiied. The side zipper made for quick and easy access to my camera and lenses in the cold. The all-weather cover (in a hidden bottom velcro comartment) was a welcome addition in heavy snow, and now in the Sprin rains. Superb craftmanship. I would absolutly buy another Lowepro bag."
3,A little small for multiple lens,"It is very solidly built, and it does offer good protection to the equipment inside. However it's a little small. I have a Canon 70-200 lens and it can fit by itself inside, but not with the camera. If I put the camera in, I can't put the lens in. I guess if you have 1 or 2 small lens (4"" or less in height) you should be ok"
4,"Convenient, though minimal space for non-camera items","Just used this pack for a trip to Disney World. The Sling concept is right on, very convenient and quick access to your camera. The only drawback was the lack of storage for other things. I was able to carry a sunglass case, Ipod, and earbud case, but nothing else. If you want to carry additional items, step up to the 200.Also, it would be nice if Lowepro would partner with Camelback to make a slingshot offering with a removable water bladder."
5,Very High Quality,"This bag is very well made and has worked well for me since I bought a few months ago (the ""100""). I can get my dslr w/ standard lens and also 55-200 lens in pretty easily and there is more room if I need it. I can even fit a mini water bottle in the top pocket-- just. I was tempted to get a larger size but this proved to be the right decision-- smaller is better as long as it meets the need."
4,good bag,"i put my d80 along with tamron sp180 and 50/1.4 in this backpack. it is very tight and you don't have to worry about the fatigue caused by the looseness. the only drawback i think is the capacity is a little limited. but anyway, it worths the price at this level."
4,Exactly as described...,"I've used my bag every day since it arrived, and I'm pleased with it. It arrived quickly, and in perfect condition, but more importantly, it does what I needed it to. It's small enough to git my DSLR w. lens cap reversed, plus either one spare lens or my external flash. There are other pockets and compartments for spare batteries/memory etc which I also use.It's built well, and I can see it lasting a long time, and coming with me on many photoshoots. Perfect for when you don't need to take a lot of equipment with you, and ideal to have with you all day without it getting annoying or heavy - but if you do need to have more with you, then you might want to look at larger sizes - also available from lowepro."
4,Good backpack but small,"This is a great solution to carry your camera and gear, but I would recommend for going one size larger. Although the manufacturer claims this can hold a camera and two lenses I find that it can only hold a smaller DSLR and a small zoom and a small prime lens. So if you have a tele zoom or you need to carry 2 zoom lenses this would be too small. Even with my small zoom and prime it is still tight fit. But it is a great design and great construction, so just go one size up and you'll be really happy."
1,Poorly designed,"I think this is a poorly designed product. It comes with several movable partitions inside that have velcro mating attachment points. The problem is, the bag has only the original strips of velcro pile to attach to and this makes it impossible to create custom size partitions for various pieces of gear. I found a competitive bag that has velcro pile throughout the interior of the bag which allows their partitioning separators to attach wherever you need them. Less money too."
3,"Okay, but....","I needed a carrying case for my camera and this one had very good reviews. There are some very nice things about it. I like the over-the-shoulder strapping and the access-while-wearing feature. However, I don't like the way it is compartmentalized and it is very easy to drop your camera when the zip compartment is fully open."
4,Love it,"Love the bag and the value. Even comes with its own ""raincoat"". Only complaint is that the top compartment is a bit too small for my flash. The Slingshot is very well made, and travels very well."
5,Amazing product !!,"I have been looking for a camera bag for sometime, that is comfortable, compact and can fit my camera/lenses (3) along with a few accessories (charger, flip video, lens filter/hood & enough room for few more items). I found this product on Amazon and just love it. It does the job for me and is easy to carry. This bag is very well designed and I love the easy access to the camera without opening the entire bag. I like the weather proof pouch too, hidden at the back of the bag (in case you need to use it in bad weather). I would recommend this product to anyone, worth the money."
5,Lowepro SlingShot Backpack,The Backpack is exactly what I needed and it came very rapidly after I ordered it.
4,Great backpack,"I really like this backpack, but I wish it was a little bit wider so that it was a little easier to take my camera (with a medium-sized lens on it) in and out of the pack. I am able to get two other lenses in the pack, which I couldn't do in my other camera bag. This is the main reason I tried the pack, so I am glad I bought it."
4,Essential gear,"I have an EOS 20D with 2 zoom lenses and I have had to leave behind two previous photography bags due to the size required for my gear. I don't like the cases that look like designed for camcorders. They are usually too big, oddly shaped or, nowadays, too small.This Slingshot bag is quite practical, small and nice looking. Beware, however, that this model is not very big. Besides the camera space (camera body with an attached lens) there are two compartments for lenses but while the left one is fine for a zooom, the right one is for a more compact, shorter lens. Not bad unless you have a big flash. There is no room for that so I had to put it on the top compartment. So it was barely enough. But on the whole I am very happy with this bag."
5,All Weather camera backpack,"It was everything it advertised as being. I can carry my digital camera and lenses as well as two point and shoot digital cameras. Being a slingshot backpack, my back doesn't moan and groan as it did with other camera bags. I like the feature of swinging the bag to the front and to get my cameras with out removing the backpack."
4,A little confusing at first...,"I bought this bag to carry my SLR and lenses to Europe and after finally figuring out how to carry it, I found it most useful and quite practical for carrying my gear. I started out swinging it around my right hip for access but felt it just wasn't right. The trick is to swing it around your left hip and it works like a charm. I was also able to carry guide books, extra battery packs, and snacks in the zip pockets. Would I recommend it? Absolutely - just practice using it first!!!"
3,Inadequate Space,"The Lowepro SlingShot 100 is not big enough to hold my Rebel XT with zoom lens, prime lens, flash and accessories. It's a tight fit."
4,GOOD PRODUCT,"IT HOLDS MY DSLR AND P&S; CAMERA WITHOUT PROBLEM. I HAVE SPACE FOR TWO LENSES. I PAID ABOUT 34.00 FOR MINE ON SALE. I LIKE THE FACT THAT YOU CAN WEAR IT AS A BACKPAK.I AM NOT A PROFESSIONAL PHOTOGRAPHER WITH MANY DIFFERENT CARRY CASES BUT I RECOMMEND THIS CASE BECAUSE OF CONVENIENCE AND QUALITY.JESUS LOVES YOU...Joh 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.Rom 5:6 Christ died for us at a time when we were helpless and sinful.Rom 5:7 No one is really willing to die for an honest person, though someone might be willing to die for a truly good person.Rom 5:8 But God showed how much he loved us by having Christ die for us, even though we were sinful."
4,Does just what it says...,"a bit small, but if you just need something to take a camera and a flash; or maybe a couple lenses, it's awesome. Great to just put it on and take off on a hike or a bike ride. the slingshot stays stable and the straps fells rigid, and secure. great zippers, plenty of options for storage with the three included velcro dividers. great buy, would recommend."
4,A fine bag for keeping it simple,"I got this bag a month ago and so far so good. This is an ideal bag if you do not want to travel heavy. I have only used it for a few hours at a time, so I have no opinion on how it is as an all-day pack. I keep an Olympus dslr with a 14-45 mounted, a 40-150 with both lens hoods in one pocket, and a speedlight in the other. It all fits, barely. The upper pocket is great for cables, batteries and such, but if you want to carry lots of filters, meters and so forth, it will be too small. The outside is also useful, but tight and flat; think pens and notebooks. The side camera access is great. If you want a great city bag, this is it, but you will want a larger bag if you go for big lenses."
5,Great camera bag for travel,"I've used this on several trips. It's single strap make it easy to flip to your front for easy access to your camera and lenses. I usually keep a DSLR, 2 lenses and flash in mine. It is also handy for holding keys, cleaning cloths, etc.. Can also be secured with locks on the zippers."
5,LOVE this!,"I've had numerous camera cases for my Canon DSLR cameras, and this one is my favorite so far. It's simple to use and easy to carry and access my camera as well as other pockets without taking it completely off. Quick access can be important with my kids and some of our adventures, so I love that feature! It also doesn't swing freely off of me like my last camera case and accidentally smack a kid in the head...that was the main reason for purchasing this. Highly recommend this high quality case!"
2,The bag is too small,"I use Canon 5D MK2+24-70 lens as my walk around-the bag barly fits that conbination with lens hood removed.After using this sling bag,I finally realized a double shoulder backpack is more comfortable for heavy camrea gears."
3,nice quality but very small,"The bag is much smaller than I expected. I've got a Nikon D90 with 2 lenses - a 18mm - 105mm and a 70mm - 300mm. The bag will hold the camera body with the smaller lens attached, and (barely) the larger lens but not much else. I've got several filters and those don't fit in this bag with the camera and lenses. The dividers aren't designed well for separating the camera body and the large lens, although it works. If you carry the bare minimum of equipment with you this may work really well, but if you carry around anything more, this will be too small. On the plus side, it's a nice quality bag."
3,This is a very small bag.,"I was really surprised how small this bag was when I received it. This is probably only useful for a small basic SLR with a kit lens and some accessories. I have a Nikon D7000 with the 18-200 lens and it does not fit well at all. The claim that it is ""Perfect for photojournalists"" is dubious. Quality seems to be very good."
1,"Doesn't fit a camera, let alone a lens","This bag is too small to hold my Canon EOS Rebel by itself, let alone the telephoto lens I had hoped to carry as well. I returned it.Trust the reviews that say it's too small. I have verified it."
3,"It does the trick, but doesn't have enough room.","Not so happy with it... Have difficulties stuffing my D200 into it, not enough space for more gear, and definitely not enough room for other things that might need during the day. You should consider an additional bag such as a hip bag to carry e.g. water and food if you're out in the fields. One good thing I have to mention is that if you strap it quite tight, you can wear it in front of you (specially on a bike) and therefore grab your camera really fast!"
1,Not my bag...,"I was disapointed with how uncomfortable this camera bag is. I was hoping to find something better than my hand held camera bag (with shoulder stap) but after receiving this in the mail, I went back to my old bag. This one is uncomfortable and just doesn't seem to make sense. It's large but it doesn't really fit anything correctly. It might be good for others but, for me, this just isn't my bag..."
3,lowepro slingshot,so far i have enjoyed it. however it need to be more roomy inside and the outside pockets need to be deeper.
4,Works well; a bit difficult to find an optimal layout,"The backpack's main compartment contains a number of adjustable walls which velcro to a few velcro spots on the inside. It doesn't allow for all that much customization (velcro spots are limited) and by default, there is no good place to put a DSLR w/lens attached. I managed to create a cavity that works for this purpose, but it wastes some space and probably doesn't quite provide optimal protection.Overall, however, the backpack has a lot of space with specialized pockets for various accessories. If you want to store your DSLR without a lens attached, then it works well. Very large lenses may not fit, but common kit lenses do."
4,not big enough,My Nikon d90 body with 18-200mm lens did not fit. It looks like a great bag for smaller products.
4,Good Bag but a little small....,Great bag design. Only problem is that it will not hold larger SLR's like the Canon 50 and up unless your really push it. For smaller SLR's it is very good. If you have a big camera you need at least the 200 or 300 model.
3,Good but incomplete,"No one knows Dinky like Mike Richardson, that's for sure. Plenty of detail and great photos on all the models included---the problem is that this only covers the British models and omits the French models from the same era. That's like writing a book about baseball but only including the American league. Good, but incomplete."
2,Not Stackable,Opted against this item because it is not stackable. It is otherwise a good item if you only need to store 1 or 2. Best feature is the two handles.
1,Blitz stuff sucks!,"Typical of just about any product made by Blitz, these are crap. They are cheaply made and not the rugged quality Scepter cans were made like. Thank the Republic of Kalifornia and their CARB laws for this stuff. It's a version of Blitz's fuel can made for water.Look for a better product if you're using it daily in an RV or an an overland expedition. If they're solely used for home preparedness they'll be fair."
4,Good Water Jugs,"You should always have water stored away. I'd clean these out with the common bleach ratio before filling for use. I have mine filled with filtered water and stored away. Keep stored water in a cool dark place = interior closet. I know others will argue, but live by the rule of 1 gallon/per adult/per day."
5,Great Value,"For the price this is a very good product. Good construction, doesnt leak, easy to carry. If there is one thing I dont like is the spout, it pours the water out a little slow. I just take the spout off when emptying it and it works great. Shipping was very fast too..."
5,This new container is just the ticket.,This new container is what a person wants if they don't want to have to deal with all the new anti spill anti fume type containers and nozzels.
2,Leaky tiki,"Nice material, good color. Wider at base than at top, for stability. When jug is sealed and laying on its side... it leaks. Kind of an important feature to not have happen. If it leaks on its side, it leaks upright too, you just don't see it much, but it can evaporate or let contaminants in, or splash out. I bought two of these, they both leak. They're both going back.I have a couple ancient Igloo brand jugs that never leak on their side or upright (or upside down for that matter - yeah, it was a rough road). I went with these new ones because the self-venting nozzle would serve my needs better than a hole on the back of the can, as in the case of the old Igloo water jugs.Looks like I'll have to go Milspec surplus to get decent jugs.YMMV"
4,Dimensions are not correct,"My only complaint is that the dimensions on amazon are not the dimensions of the product. If that is something you care about, do a little more research. I was wanting to fit these in a certain storage area. With some adjustments, I can still use them, but it just makes things more complicated."
2,"A little flimsy, and not exactly as described","This product is described as featuring a ""Transparent color (that) allows view of water level."" Unfortunately, that is not true. Mine came molded in an opaque blue plastic, and you cannot see the water level.Also, the spout is made from a thin plastic that feels brittle, and both it and the container have poorly molded threads that make it easy to cross-thread the spout when attaching it. Furthermore, the container cannot be sealed without the spout in place and exposed as shown in the product photo. This all combines to make the spout a vulnerable weak point that could be relatively easily snapped off, rendering the container useless.I will keep mine since I don't intend to use it regularly and I think the spout will survive my limited use, but my next purchase will be a genuine army-issue water can. They are much more durable."
4,Good value for the money,"Bought two of these through Amazon and the price is very good compared to the same product in a local hardware store (about 1/3 less). I like the side handle which makes pouring water much easier. I also like the solid spout. Had Rubbermaid cans before and still have one, the spout disintegrated. It was one of those ""adjustable"" accordion spouts. I wish my gas cans had the handle and simple spout. Had Rubbermaid cans before and still have one. These have an air relief and these cans would benefit from that. I am going to take the suggestion of someone else and drill a small hole in the right place and put a stainless steel screw in it for air relief. Wish I could make this 4 1/2 stars for that reason. 4 - too low; 5 - too high."
3,leaks at lid,"The jug is light and convenient, given the two handles. It is blue/gray opaque, not transparent. Most annoying, the instructions say not to store the spout in container, yet the lid leaks without it. Must be stored upright. Catch 22 since the hard plastic spout just asks to be broken off if installed. Cap either needs a gasket or a design change so it is deep enough to take the threads and seal completely."
4,"An interesting combination of archaeology, anthropology and theology.","An interesting combination of archaeology, anthropology and theology. Focusing on the discoveries of archaeological significance in Israel over the last 100 years or so, the book takes the reader through such discoveries as the James ossuary, the Temple Mount, the ruins at Qumran and other sites (notably Ceasaria Maritima, Sepphoris, Nazereth and Capernaum) to compare what archaeology says with what was written - both by contemporary authors (Josephus, Philo, etc) as well as the Biblical accounts to arrive at a picture of first century Judea.John Dominic Crossan has written many books on the subject of the historical Jesus, and this is not going to broach any new insights if you are familiar with his work. However, it will provide the reader with an interesting perspective from a more archaeological point of view, which will be of interest to the non-religious reader in particular."
3,James Ossuary shouldn't be here,"I must question the inclusion of the James Ossuary in the Top Ten list (#1 even) in this book. The authenticity of the inscription was dubious from the start, and has since been proven a forgery. Reading their reasons for including this bone box, I wondered why they didn't include other alleged artifacts about Jesus.If authenticity isn't a high priority, then why didn't they include the Shroud of Turin? Or the hundreds of supposed nails to Jesus' cross that's being venerated in churches across the old world. Or some decayed piece of wood that was part of the cross where the son of man was executed. Religious relics are a dime a dozen if we throw away the criterion of authenticity, and James' bone box wouldn't make the top ten.Very disappointed."
3,It was ok,"The first few chapters really grabbed me. But they lost me at the part where they began writting as if the theoretical ""Q Gospel"" was a reality. Several lengthy chapters dedicated to an imagined reality. And one might miss the single sentence that says ""let's suppose..."" Biblical scholars know Matthew's gospel is longer because Matthew was likely the only apostle who could write. He was a tax collector and probably knew shorthand. Luke's gospel varies because he learned second hand. Mark's gospel varies further as he learned from Luke. But what do I know? ;)"
1,"Disappointing, disjointed","The authors try to convince the reader that since archaeology involves peeling back the physical layers of ancient settlements, then exegesis should also peel back layers of the Gospels. This is not an obvious truth and requires a leap to accept. They then proceed to ""peel back"" layers in the Gospels, pretty much at random and without convincing me. They use circular reasoning, biased judgments and some fairly insulting claims about the Gospel writers. It makes a lot more sense and is certainly more intellectually honest to take the witnesses to Jesus's life as serious historians. Where do I go to get my money back? (Sorry, I bought the book elsewhere, not at amazon.com.)"
2,"What, where, when?","I bought this author, not the book. I have several others by himand they are all thick books with lots of words. I have nevergotten much out of any of the books. I will not buy anymore booksby this author."
3,Look to the past for the answers in the present,"Courtney Tanner cannot understand why her husband Justin has confined her to a mental hospital. After five months of maximin confinement, she escapes, only to find that Justin is not all that he appears.Justin Tanner is surprised when he finds Courtney at his doorstep, more surprised when she claims that she married Justin Tanner. A different Justin Tanner that lived in his house. Justin is determined to find out who impersonated him, married under his name and lived in his home. The secret lies in Courtney's past, a past she cannot remember.I've read many books by Jasmine Cresswell (mostly recent releases) and loved them all. This one wasn't as good. The romance seemed forced and there wasn't much chemistry. For a great book by Jasmine Cresswell, I suggest Secret Sins, The Daughter, or The Disappearance."
3,A Fun Read,While you will find the scenario on the ridiculous side. Courtney marrying a man she hardly knows. But I promise you will enjoy this novel. The suspense alone will captivate you. While this isn't my favorite Jasmine Cresswell novel but isn't not the worst. Buy it and enjoy the ride.
3,doesn't work for my car CD player,"The CDs are good but be aware that CD-RW disc doesn't work with many car CD players, e.g., mine. I can't play music in my car."
4,I enjoy reading Higgins.,"His research seems to be very complete with details that one can relate to, based on actual historic events.I intend to read all of his books.."
2,Thriller-less Thriller,"Yikes! A bartender and a young nightclub singer are involved in a Nazi plot in Lisbon (""here's looking at you...""). Throw in the Gestapo, black musicians, a Japanese fixer-diplomat, Admiral Canaris, António de Oliveira Salazar, Reinhard Heydrich, Winston Churchill, Heinrich Himmler, and all that is missing are the Valkyries. But in lieu of opera, Higgins bases the plot on a kidnapping of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor. There are two interesting pieces to this thriller-less thriller; the revisionist casting of the Duke as a deep, romantic, wily patriot and the very sympathetic view of SS-Brigadeführer Walter Schellenberg. The novel is based on an actual attempt by Schellenberg to convince the Duke and Duchess of Windsor to work for Germany. Higgins is on autopilot with this one with a talky book lacking his usual action."
3,An 80's album that was subpar!,"Other than Apollonia Kotera's good looks and the hit song ""Sex Shooter"" and maybe one other cut, this album was subpar at best. It doesn't quite hold a candle to Vanity 6 1982 album, but that is still no excuse for this album to not be available to the people on cd. After all, it was on Warner Brother's label and it was under the tutelage of one musical genius named Prince. So that itself is enough said. So therefore, i'm giving this album a rating of 3 stars."
4,Clifford's Happy Easter,"Very colorful illustrations. Cute easter book. My son enjoys it. Doesn't really go over much about easter other than coloring eggs, but cute enough."
2,"Love Clifford, where are the stickers?",I love Clifford. I got this book and was excited at the promise of stickers for my little girl. there are no stickers. I looked 3 times. They should change the description.
1,Not The Cream that you are thinking of,"A quick listen to the samples confirms that whoever this is, they are not Eric Clapton, Ginger Baker, and Jack Bruce. This is contemporary dance music."
5,What a fantastic book! :),"I was searching for confirmation that our loved ones still exist after passing...came across Georges book..and was totally blown away!!:) I recommend it to anyone that is seeking confirmation. It explores the afterlife/earth communications and has scientific studies to back it up. Extremely well written and amazing to read how Michael,Georges dear friend,is able to communicate.A must read for anyone with a curiosity about life after death communications!!Keep up the good work,Michael!:)"
1,Don't waste your money and time,"My God. It's just bunch of lies. The story is so fake and just his imaginations. I was hoping that it would really be based on truth and reality, but I got so disappointed after reading this book.Do NOT waste your money to buy it."
4,A Revelation for Agnostics and Skeptics,"This book is a must-read. When a friend showed me this book by a mental health worker, I thought it would be really clinical and dry. What a surprise to find that it's well written, filled with new discoveries regarding the subject of life after death. I don't usually go for this genre, but the writing flows and the author lets the readers decide for themselves whether the story makes a good case for life after death. The book makes a lot of sense, and it's really exciting to see that science is backing up some of the claims of organized religion, without any dogma, plus it's entertaining reading."
2,"Great, but delicate","We got one of these for our youngster and he liked it a lot but it broke. He may have knocked it over. So we got another, it broke too, in a couple. NOT a durable child's toy, by any means. I don't mean he threw it across the room, I mean he knocked it over while it sat on his desk, and that's all it took, twice."
4,Buy These Boots!,These boots are very comfortable & look great. Felt good right out of the box & fit true to size. Leather is very soft & the boot is very well made. Worth the money.
3,"Okay, but...","There is one huge unbelievable factor. And it's what the entire books stems from: Nina's pregnancy. This couple knows next to nothing about pregnancy (eg: some of the very obvious questions they have for the doctor), yet somehow readers are suppose to believe that Nina knew she was ovulating on the exact day she agreed to have Joe's baby. Huh? Not only that, but she gives him one night (that night) to conceive. To top it off, she's 36-years-old! Hello??? Most twenty-somethings have trouble conceiving the first month, let alone from one night!I know this is fiction, but seriously, that one line ""It has to be tonight"" makes the rest of the book (well-written as it is) a little hard to swallow."
3,"Predictable, light read","Not Wendy Markham's best writing. I couldn't stand the Nina character. It takes too long to get to the good parts of the book and by that time you want to put it down. Skip this and read Once Upon a Blind Date, also by Markham."
2,NOT a Light Breezy Read,"Judging a book by it's cover, I thought this book would be a light breezy read similar to the novels of Rachel Gibson, Elizabeth Beverley and such. Instead I found myself with a book about a mother's long ago death and the struggles a young woman faces dealing with raising her younger siblings. Nina dreams of the day she can leave her responsiblities behind but her best friend (whose fiancee ran off to become a nun 15 years ago)asks Nina to make him a daddy before she goes.This book is packed with tragedy amd not many laughs. The tragedy drags on and on as Nina wrestles with the idea of being a mother herself. NOT a fun read. I barely made it to the end. The last few chapters of the book seem very rushed and not very fleshed out, a major revelation seems to be thrown in at the last minute without a lot of background.This book just really seemed to drag. I think the publisher should have chosen a different cover for such heavy reading material."
4,A Contemporarily Good Read!,"I found this book as a wonderful contemporary read! Great story line and characters are what kept me wanting to read more. Of course there are situations that happen to the characters that made me want to scream, but it also made me read further to find out how they handled it.It is an enjoyable and entertaining read. Although, highly predictable, it is a wonderful journey with the Chickalini family!"
4,Worth Reading !!!,"I finished reading the Nine Month Plan in ONE NIGHT!!! It was really good!! I have to admit it was very predictable, but a wonderful read."
1,What's wrong with the past tense?,"I really liked the characters and the idea of this book, but I found it almost unreadable. The story was told completely through dialogue and the PRESENT tense. I've never read a book completely told in the present tense and now I know why. Although the reader might think this would increase the intimacy, it doesn't. Instead, the brain needs to slog through a tense that just doesn't work at all.I've never read a book by Ms. Markham and never will again until she writes on the front that she uses past tenses.Wasn't there an editor at Warner to point this difficulty out?"
5,I loved it,"I don't care what anyone says about this book. I loved it. I loved the characters, the story, and the ending. Also...people who have reviewed this book have given the ending away...which isn't cool. People read the reviews to decide if they want to buy the book. If you tell them how it ends, they won't need to get it. I would recommend this book to any woman."
3,Nine Month Plan,"The back cover gave me the impression the book would be a light read. Needless to say, I found it more serious than what I expected.I didn't care for Nina's 'incubator' mentality. I found myself consistenly disappointed in Nina. I was drawn more to Joe. I found Joe's character endearing. He showed her the patience of a saint throughout the entire book.It was obvious he was having difficulty treating her as an impartial party in the whole pregancy scheme even though it's what she wanted. Yet, sometimes I got the feeling Nina seemed to want something else. Love? 'Mommy' status? What was Joe, a mind reader? She made her plan pretty clear and being a 'mommy' wasn't part of the plan.I admit I kept reading, chapter after chapter, hoping Nina would come to her senses sooner than later. Even though the end of the story left me feeling good I wasn't feeling good about Nina's character up to that point."
1,Worse than bad,"This is a hinder to you using your camera. Hard to attach a tripod to camera with the rubber flopping into the underneath of the camera. Fits like a glove - a baseball glove. The Rubber on the back covers all the buttons and makes all the buttons sloppy to push. Each change of the menu was an ordeal and a lesson in anger management. I ended up going underneath the rubber to get access to the controls.Nice try, but don't bother. I cut mine off with a razor so I would not be tempted to use it again."
2,Not worth it,"I bought this for my D40X a few weeks ago, and I have to say I'm not impressed. The rubber is very restrictive, and doesn't really do anything but keep it from getting scratched. If you still drop the camera from eye-level the rubber ""armor"" will only keep all of the broken pieces of your SLR close together when it smacks into the floor, and by no means save your lens or camera from damage."
4,Ruggedized Camera Cover,"There are three parts: 1. Case which is designed to fit over the entire camera; 2. Clear plastic part which fits over the view lens on the back of the camera.; 3. A large round rubber piece designed to fit over the lens in the front of the camera.The soft pliable rubber fits snuggly over the Nikon D40 camera, providing a the camera with a protective barrier. A clear plastic piece is designed to fit over the back view lens which provides scratch resistance.I personally don't use piece number 3.It does the job - provides ""armor"". It was recommended to me by a friend and I recently also recommended it to another friend.I use it on my Nikon D40."
3,Camera Armor - not really but useful,"The body armor increases your grip, keeps the camera clean and avoids scratches, however the hood armor is kind of a joke - it won't stay on a 52mm lens - maybe better with a larger lens - I just don't use it.The buttons are actually easier to push with the armor on, INMHO. The grip keeps your finger from sliding, and the fit is tight. Interferes with mounts a little, but it's easy to move the armor out of the way."
1,Bulky,Sent back.............Was very bulky and did not feel need for that much rubber around my camera. Made the camera that much bigger. Anyone with small hands I think would have a problem.
1,AWFUL,"Rubber hides color-coded clearly labelled buttons with solid thick black rubber. Impressions for labels are raised without color and hard to see. Pressing buttons extremely difficult with rubber on. Indeed, I found it impossible to do some functions successfully with it on."
5,Great Fit,"The Camera Armor that I got was a great fit, not only on the camera but for My style of photography. I take My Nikon D-40 along with Me almost everywhere We go, farm, hunting, fishing or just along on the Rhino for some off-road adventure. Even with the use that I give My camera's, I still like to be cautious about ""bruising"" them, three Nikon's, with the body armor I feel more secure against slight accidents that would otherwise make My camera's look abused. The SLR Camera Armor gives Me that security. No problems with installation or fit, They Are What I Expected, and MORE. Inexpensive Insurance!!!!"
3,"Christmas ""Green""","Really too small for my 90# dog, but she plays with it anyway. It hasn't been torn apart yet, so far, so good!"
3,"Product was as described, however, broke 1st day","Updating rating, meant to select 3 of 5 rather than 1 of 5 as the dog is still useable. and its actually good that the signing unit (that broke) is able to be removed easily as there is a velcro pouch it is in.The singing dog arrived as expected, however, I would not recommend it as it was broke the first day my dog played with it. the toy itself was cute and the singing was good when it first worked - but just not made as well as other singing dog toys i have purchased.Probably would not buy again."
4,The best pregnancy organizer,"I'm a first-time mom-to-be, and this book has been invaluable to us. We refer to the checklists and advice constantly. A lot of other organizers are actually more like journals, with space to write how you feel each day, what symptoms you're experiencing, your most embarrassing pregnancy moments, etc. Who wants to do that every day? I want to know what I need to buy and what I don't, what I should focus on getting done each trimester, and tips from real moms. This book offers practical advice and checklists to help you prepare for your baby. The only drawbacks, as mentioned by other reviewers, are that there should be tabs and pockets for storing stuff."
2,Some good info but not much of an organizer,"While I find some of the checklists and suggestions useful, I found it difficult to use as an organizer. I would have liked pockets to hold receipts and appointment cards, a calendar and so on. I found it difficult to locate the pages where I could write in appointment information and if I squeezed in a new appointment, I had to put it on a later page since there are only 3 appts. per page. In the end, I tossed it aside and just moved back to my daytimer. Overall, I'm sorry I spent any money on it."
5,"convenient, compact","This planner was my savior during my entire pregnancy. The cover pics are less than stylish however, the convenient size made up for that. I also purchased a larger, more sophisticated one for more money. That ended up being a gift as it was too large to fit in my purse and this planner had everything the more expensive one had. I'm a first time mother although, I would purchase another for a second child. A definite necessity for anyone with ""pregnancy brain."""
1,OK,It was ok. The belly book was much better and I have never used this I went threw it and was disappointed
3,"""Ahead of it's time"" !? You wrote your review in the 60's ??","I read ""Sam 7"" and didn't think too much of it since it's quite old nowdays. It's a book for people who lived to find airports invented.Try reading something by Tom Clancy. That's more contemporary and far more thrilling.About ""It could happen tomorrow"", it did. Notice the PAST sentence."
3,Not for the undecided,"While the author's clinical experience seems extensive, this is not a book for those who have yet to decide whether Melanie Klein was on to something or not. The vignettes contain interpretations that are definitely in the realm of ""through this lens I view the world"". Clinicians of other persuasions can come up with interpretations just as valid as those offered by the author. There is no area of psychoanalytical work that requires such leaps of faith as dealing with preverbal individuals or very young children just learning to talk. This is a technical book for adherents to Kleinian theory or for students who are interested in a very lucid explanation of said theory."
5,excellent book-detailed with great photos,"This is a wonderful book for those who have visited Monticello and want a ""souvenir"" and those who are admirers of Thomas Jefferson and want to know more about his personal life. He was a fascinating man and there is much to be admired."
3,"Metallak, his Legacy","Metallak, his Legacy is fiction. Actually it is historical fiction. While the main character, as well as others, were real living people in the19th century, little is known about any of them. Metallak was well know among his contemporaries, but little of his life is known outside the personal experiences and anecdotes of those people, and little has ever been written about him. The author has written a fictional account based on these real life experiences as told by others. Most of these people were trustworthy and their stories can be accepted as fact. Other books have been written which include these same experiences and anecdotes, but Noyes has turned them all into a biography which is both believable and interesting, if a little bit on the simple side. A cute story of an otherwise little known historical character."
2,Cumbersome and slow!,"Adobe promised big things for inDesign. They delivered on most all of them. Unfortunately, in their desire to make this program all things to all people compatible, they made it slow loading and cumbersome to work with. Even a two or three page document can take many seconds to load. Stick with Quark XPress until Adobe can get this one right. Or, if you absolutely must, stick with PageMaker."
1,jesus church growth policy,"""a method you won't get in seminary."" Thank God, and lets leave it that way.this marketing shindig is man's methods, not God's. You might as well burn all your bibles if your going to listen to this ungodly nonsense.I guess we should add barna's revelation to the bible, since the apostles were clueless.... eh.you would have to think george barney is more intelligent than God to see this as an improvement than what we get in the Bible. the church needs to be based on disciples, not on lazy cattle waiting to be entertained.sure, this method will get large numbers, but most of those will be sheep stolen from other congregations rather than zealous disciples.all in all this method is great at getting lots of cattle, and fattening them for the slaughter, but i hope this is not our goal."
1,The title says it all,"This book is a reproach to Christianity. A great example of Christians letting modern culture dictate its mission and agenda. This phrase of Barna's is typical:"" It is critical that we keep in mind a fundamental principle of Christian communication: the audience, not the message is sovereign."" (pg. 145) Not to orthodox,eh? There's more - Barna's unique interpretations of Jesus' life and words. Good thing this is out of print!"
3,Psycho Cat,"This shelf is simple to install, ingenious,andinexpensive. However our cat, being a cat, hasnot accepted it yet. It is July 1 and the shelfcover is fur-like. It may too warm for her. Butwho knows with cats.We feel that she will like itas the weather turns cooler. This cat needs to seea shrink."
3,kitty shelf,Cats keep knocking it down. Is not broken yet. Inexpensive item. Very cheaply made. Still keep putting it back up and kittys still use it all the time.
2,Disappointing for cats across America...,I didn't like this product - it needed to be screwed onto the window and was small and flimsy. I'm still thinking about returning it.
2,2 stars,"This is basically a piece of wood, a thin piece of foam, and the equivalent of a carpeted toilet seat cover that barely fits over all of it. The support arm barely supports a cat. If I were to permanently affix it, it would be more secure. However, if I wanted a permanent one, I would have gotten one. It doesn't strike me as more comfortable than the interior ledge of the window.It's hard to sell a product for this cheap, and yet still leave the buyer feeling that it was not a great deal. But it did.Maybe a suction cup at the end of the arm would be more secure? I don't know."
1,Kitty Shelf Model KS-1,the support arm on the bottom of the shelf is not sturdy enough to support the shelf. it allows the product to slip down and then flip out of the window when the cat jumps on it. Very poor product.
2,nice bag but way too big for regular camera!,this bag is perfectly fine but dont buy it for a camera unless you want to put lots of other things in it too! its huge -- totally meant for a video camera and lots of accessories. Its deceptive because when i bought my camera on amazon it suggested this as an appropriate case and actually its not the right size.
2,Not good for a camera.,"I was deceived by the size of the bag. It was recommended for Sony Cybershot H50, but I guess we can easily fit in couple of camera's. Its way too big for the camera.If you are looking for a big size camera bag then this is a good one."
2,Stop wasting your money,"I checked out this bag online ans was almost about to buy it before I headed out to the nearest Walmart store and checked this out for myself. If you are planning to carry your lunch box in this, then this is the right bag. This is outright bulky and large for a camera period. For about 10 bucks I found a much better choice, Lezura Camera bag. Also if anyone thought that Sony made this bag then they are in for a big ride. This bag is probably made by some Chinese company and Sony has chosen them as their official supplier and command a undeserving high price tag. Don't fall for it and visit a Walmart store near you to get the right bag."
3,Wish it were smaller,The case is fine but I do wish I had something a bit smaller. This is a bag for someone with extra lenses and/or accessories!
5,Sony Cyber-shot Carrying Case,This case is well made and the camera fits nicely inside. There is plenty of space for accessories. The shoulder strap and attachment points are sturdy. I can recommend this case without reservations.
3,Sure he was a snob...,"It's OK to concede this.And he was an armchair academic who eschewed every opportunity for real-life praxis.He was human, fallible, prone to snap judgments on subjects he didn't understand.And YET...despite his snobbery (why wasn't he frequenting the great jazz clubs of South L.A. if he was so interested in essaying the subject?), and despite his vulnerability to any number of Sloterdijkian critiques...there are enough moments of tough, bristling intelligence to make it all so very worthwhile.BUT DON'T START HERE. Go straight to the fount; with Adorno context is EVERYTHING. Pick up Aesthetic Theory (Hullot-Kentor translation) and Minima Moralia. Appetite whetted? Try Negative Dialectics next. And then come back here and write your own review. :)"
5,Perennial mirrors,"Do not be put off by Adorno's so-called ""critique"" of jazz music.Adorno's critique, all critiques are embodied in jazz. His use of the essay-form itself shows his desire to put constraints on his art to free himself, from those boundaries he denounces, or boundaries which he feels will co-opt him. Besides, many who call him a ""snob"" for this are forgetting that jazz improvisation is a transgression of the idiom, which is what Adorno speaks of when he labels it a fashion. He speaks of the idiom, and the lack of possibilities on divers ONTOLOGICAL levels. No matter what he thought, he's still a super-cronopio."
3,"very nice, but two of them arrived broken !!!",There was only one problem: two of them arrived broken! :-( But the other two ones are very nice!!!
2,Brief set of rules and keys,"Not exactly what I was looking for. There is a series of 101 study keys. I find it to be a summery of a summery, the book has a fixed format so when more detail in needed the topic still must be covered in 2 pages. Not really any example problems. The inexpensive price may make it look attractive, but I couldn't recommend it."
4,pool,pool is great once its full took 2 hours with 2 hoses running in to it. Would recomend to buy cover for it at the same time. water will get warm with cover on it . saddley live on a millitary base and regulations dont allow a big pool. So the childer got to use it once then we had to take it down bummer. like the product though
3,kiddy pool,"Arrived on time. Product gets ""very"" pliable when sun warms up, but it does it's job of keeping leaves and bugs out."
5,The first half of the book alone worth the price,"I'm not even done with the book yet, but I have to say, I am really enjoying it so far. When Pastor Weaver describes her life...the troubled upbringing, the poor life choices, the panicked feeling of not being able to help herself...I can relate. When she talks about her approach to dealing with the pain...I can relate. When she states that the solution is in God FIRST, and getting into His Word, I am nodding my head enthusiastically. I feel that this is what God has been telling me for a while now. I'm just a slow listener.Her eight week plan starts off with preparing yourself through scripture first, and I think that that is extremely important. For most of us, the thought of dieting again is filled with anxiety and panic. We try to do it under our own power, and for me, that has never, ever worked for the longterm. I highly recommend this book for Christians, especially women. And for anyone else willing to hear the message in it."
2,Disappointed,"I'm always looking for ways to improve my life based upon God's ways and that is why I chose this book to help me improve my health. However, I was very disapointed in this book. It was more of a personal story instead of an instruction book on how to get and maintain better health. After the first few chapters, I finally stopped reading the book because it took too long to get to the point."
3,OK but not great,The price is a bit steep but I think overall it is a good product i gueuss it's as good as any. But i usually go for cheaper things!
4,$24.99 = 10 cents per bag after Hefty rebate,"I don't know how good these bags are but I do know that Freezer bags are much better than other ziploc type plastic storage bags and you need to have as much protection as possible for food in the freezer. Tightward Gazette recommends recycling plastic bags. I have never done so but a sturdier bag would stand up better to being washed. I like the zipper mechanism which works on this model but does not work on the jumbo size. However, America's Test Kitchen found that this type was not airtight and was inferior to the Glad seal."
1,Cannot recommend except for an elementary introduction,"This book is an extremely elementary introduction to the subject. There is nothing wrong with it, but I would rate it at the high school level, and not suitable for advanced study."
2,below average,"The whole title and description made me really want to read this book, but it really disappointed me. The characters really had no depth, and it turned out to really be nothing special. The whole ""who did it?????"" concept seems like something that has been used and used and was a little boring. Also I think that the author could have been a little more descriptive with the people and the whole place. I do find myself agreeing with the whole hiding behind the hair thing... I do it myself!All in all I think that the vocab. and flat, 2D characters in the book would be a little more appropriate for someone between the ages of 9-11, but most parents would complain if their 9-year-old was reading about a bloody murder, so I don't know what age group would enjoy this book. So, just take my advice and DON'T READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,"Nixon fan, but . . . .","I used to read every Nixon book I could get my hands on at the library a long time ago. I still read YA books from time to time (esp as I'd like to write them), and was pleased to see there were some newer ones than those I remembered. I picked this up to give it a shot. The writing is fine, as I did want to keep reading it. But it started better than it ended. There were moments in the beginning that I laughed out loud at. I would have liked her to explore Emily's relationship with her friends more though and I felt the climax was seriously rushed. I also would have liked to see Emily's family's reactions to everything that happened. It was enjoyable, but the realtionships could have been worked through better. I'm a hopeless romantic, so I wish they'd done a bit more with Maxwell, but the promising start kind of tapered off by the end. Maybe it could have just used an extra chapter. I'd recommend some of Nixon's older mysteries before this one. But this wasn't bad."
3,Look Behind You Emily..,"As a child, Emily witnessed a murder which left her psychologically scarred.Now, the murderer is after her, but Emily never saw the murderer's face.It could be one of many people and Emily must find out whom.A decent mystery, but I could not stand Haley and her stupid runes."
4,an awesome movie,i loved this movie it was so cute and funny i wana buy it when it comes out on dvd it had the cutest storyline and was just a really great movie <3erin
2,A Lot Like Love is A Lot Like Stupidity,"I went to see this movie with my girlfriend. She laughed hysterically throughout the movie, while I was laughing as well, but about a completely different thing. She laughed because she thought it was funny. I laughed because I thought it was ridiculously stupid.The screenplay was horrible. About every other line, I would shake my head in dissapointment. The plot must have been written without thought. The acting was alright. But I am not an Ashton Kutcher fan. If he can become a famous actor, then so can any other average person.I must say this is one of the worst movies ever. Crossroads was a better movie than this. Don't waste your time watching this like I did."
2,Dissapointed,Whilst we paid for Gold Class tickets to see this movie - the flick was far from Gold. The 'romance' between Emily and Olly was non-existant. There was no on screen chemistry between these two at all.I wouldn't recommend this movie to any one. Sorry.
4,A Lot Like Love,"Great movie! Light hearted, funny and cute. Everyone should be in a relationship with their best friend, the one you can laugh and be yourself with."
3,Not Bad...,"Not Bad... starts off pretty slow... the characters are surprisngly believable.... given the fact that it's a romantic comedy, the ending is predictable.... but the ride to get there is pretty good.... the soundtrack however is very good, and functions as an excellent backdrop to the movie."
2,Skip it,"While watching this, I realized something. You know you're getting older when everything you see starts reminding you of something you've seen before, that you liked a lot better.At best, this film is basically a half-assed 'Say Anything' knock-off. At worst, you'll want to hang yourself watch Peete and Kutcher try and ""out-cute"" one another. The truth, however, always seems to be somewhere in the middle.Myself ... I'll take Lloyd Dobler and Diane Court any day over this fluff."
4,great movie,"I saw this movie on TV one weekend and knew I had to have it. I could not find it in any of my local movie or department stores, so I went straight to amazon.com to find it. Sure enough, they had it and a great price for it too. Received emails throughout the ordering and shipping processes and received my DVD well packaged about the time, maybe a day earlier, than I expected. I've bought quite a few items from amazon.com and have never been disappointed yet."
1,A LOT LIKE A BIG FLOP!,"A note to Ashton : Dear Ashton, why do you insist on playing the same roles over and over again? The first weekend out and it only grossed seven million dollars which by all acounts is considered a major flop indeed. Movies that gross over twenty million in its first week is consdered average. I predict this movie will not have the legs to last 3 weeks in the cinemas and will quickly go to video. This was a very tedious, poor written movie starring perhaps one of the most boring actors ever to grace the silver screen. Ashton is no longer, not that he ever was, a big Hollywood draw. He is utterly unlikeable and annoying much in the same vain an adult who carries on like an infant is. Sorry, but you need to start considering other roles or you will be back in Iowa picking corn before you know it."
4,Ashton Kutcher is soooo cute!,"it starts in the airplans bathroom..and aftr years the two unite, destiny brings them toghether, with individual heartbrks the two finlly find each other,,,rather fate brings them to each other... lovely flick.movie is tooo cool.. no messed ups, lovely encounters, dont miss the new yrs party scene ;o) muvie is funny and too sweet to b missed.. watch it wid d one u love!"
4,"Original story, decent job by Peet and Kutcher","Again, didn't expect much out of a movie with Aston Kutcher, I gear up usually for crude humor and a few brainless laughs, but this movie was different, and he actually showed he could be a decent actor. Amanda peet was perfectly cast along side him. An entertaining story of love that took 6 years to perfect, and along the way they discovered things that were ""a lot like love"", but will true love find them in the end. Will Oliver (Kutcher) get his 6 year plan complete, and will Emily (Peet) be paying him $50 for the bet they make when they first meet in New York. It move along at just the right pace, and not overdone or to long either, keeps you hooked. So check it out for a romantic comedy, its not to shabby."
4,Fun to watch! It blows that Amazon Prime Members have to pay to watch a 7 year old film!,This movie is quirky and cute and the dynamic between Amanda Peet and Ashton Kutcher is fun to watch.The only reason I'm writing a review is to say that it is ludicrous that Amazon is charging $2+ to rent this 7 year old movie even to Amazon Prime subscribers. I guess I need to write a review about PRIME not being so prime after all.
4,A lot Like Love,"this movies has it all the comedy the romance, its not boring at all so fun and amusing"
2,A LOT LIKE CRAP,Ok i must admit i was suckered into watching this beacuse of my friend shes said it was a very interesting love story so i watch it from the beginning it started like any relationship would start first friends then love then comes ???? what i didnt understand is that fate brought them toghther everytime they met they had sex and thats was it no mutual feelings and for that it took them 1o freaking years to realize they were in love how many chances do you get at love my first impression was both ashton and amanda peet did have chemistry the only problem isafter ten years theyll probably get sick of each other
5,cute,"although this movie is quite unrealistic, i fell in love with it. the music on this dvd is amazing, the song ""brighter than sunshine"" by aqualung is played throughout the movie and it just makes me want to fall in love.in the movie, the two keep finding each other, no matter what, apparently falling for each other. although they get seperated, they keep coming back, knowing that deep down inside, they are in love with one another.the movie is predictable, cute, sexy, and spontaneous. i'm not a fan of ashton kuther, but i still enjoyed this film.it's cute!"
2,doesn't fit well,"I have bought three of these (one seat, two seat and three seat sofas). This cover doesn't fit well. It keeps coming off the sofa and have to keep tucking it in. It's not worth the money."
1,slip cover bummer,"This was not a good fit for me. It looks like a sheet on your chair, and even with some dryer heat to get it ironed it looks like a sheet. Also the Amazon prompted it could be returned to Target if you needed to return it rather then the normal return process for Amazon. This turned out to be the worse choice. Not only did I wait in a long line, then the Target associate was held up with trying to return this product, but the hassle got worse when the person she was talking to decided I can NOT return it to Target and shipped another one instead. This blocked my Amazon account for days, and I feel it reflected wrong information saying I could return it this way. I refused the new shipment or course, and after a few days could return it to Amazon with customer service and an apology email. Not to mention it's thin and ugly on the furniture."
1,Maiden,"How was it possible that these two were in love? Jura was an absolute bitch. She was really unlikeable because she was so conceited and completely bent on being a warrior and acting all tough. Rowen was so confusing. He was emotional, crying, then emotionless, apathetic. I was more interested in her friend's love story."
2,The Maiden,"Not one of her better ones. Having a hard time in deciding what to rate it. The story was decend, but the constaint arguing/yelling and Jura thinking she was right all the time, got to me. She never gave Rowan a chance. There was no give on her side. Her mind was set in the beginning and that was it. I tried to give her the a chance to explain away why she would act like this, but eventually just got of sick of it. Rowan at times was the same way, but he would see when he was wrong and would come around, or even give a little when he wasn't. Jura pretty much never admitted she was wrong until the end. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great. I decided it was probably a 2.5 so I gave it a 2.."
1,One of the Worst,I don't usually submit book reviews but I was compelled to for this book. It is one of the worst books I have ever read. Seriously. I couldn't force myself to read the last three chapters but just scanned through them quickly to see if there was a miraculous recovery. There was no miracle. How could this get published????
3,It was okay,"I felt that there were too many mind games through out the book, that I was exhausted. The characters were so busy being head strong it kind of took away some romance for me. I liked the theme though and over all I can't say I was terribly disappointed. I just felt it could have been a lot better."
4,The Maiden...Not Bad,"Was a pretty good read for Devereaux...different anyway. I thought she had some original spins in terms of plot and setting. So if you are looking for something different, yet entertaining, give it a whirl. I thought is was well written with good pacing."
3,Strong men and equally strong women,Jura and Rowan are a lovely couple. With most of Deveraux's books there is always a mystery. This is one of a story of true intent. This was a good Deveraux book. The end was weak!!! If you like Deveraux you won't have a hard time reading this.
2,About to give it away . . ..,"I've read this book once in all the years that I've had it. It simply isn't the type of book that I like. There was immediate attraction between the characters. That was the only good thing about the book. After their intial meeting, the book tends to fizzle. There was far too much arguing to suit my taste. I didn't feel that the characters knew each other so much as that they were hot for one another."
2,Not Jude Deveraux's best,"For an author who puts out some of the best romance books, this was a real disappointment....it was very slow, boring"
1,Boring,"This used to be a wonderful, innovative, different rubberstamping delight. Now it looks like all the others. It's small and not nearly as much fun as it used to be."
1,2 Videos - $13.99 - iTunes anyone?,"I love Mariah, but they are smoking if they want this much for 2 music videos!Why don't the music companies realize they are losing a [...] load of money on music videos that they could be selling and release every artist's music videos and in their entirety on 1 or 2 discs, nobody wants to put in 10 different DVDs to see all of an artist's videos..."
1,I Love Mariah Carey But.....,I Agree With Alot Of What Everyone's Saying Why Pay This Much For 2 Videos? And Why Havent They Released A DVD With ALL Mariahs Videos On It? Instead I Gotta Download All Them On KaZaA Or Limewire Or Ares....Well I Guess Until They Release An Official DVD Of Her Music Videos Im Forced To Download Them All.
4,A Golden Cord connects the teachings of the Master Soul,"Glenn Sanderfur traces the Golden Cord that connects the many lives of the Master Soul who became the Christ. Sanderfur uses the psychic readings of Edgar Cayce to put the pieces of the great puzzle together, and to explain the mystical workings of the One God and the Holy Spirit. I had bits and pieces of this mystery presented to me through other works through many years of searching, but LIVES OF THE MASTER puts it all together in a concise well written work. Glenn Sanderfur does an excellent job of gracefully and insightfully telling the story that begins with Amilius and Adam and ends with Jesus who became the Christ. This is an exciting and easy read - the suspence of a mystery that keeps you turning pages and feeling that special feeling you only get when you discover great ""truths""."
4,LCD CD Review.,"I think that this is a great album. It has a flow to it that many Cd's do not have. From songs like Winter Train to Oh Celia I cannot stop listening, and yes singing in my car. I think that there is a song or two for everyone's taste, though I like them all."
2,Interesting,I was given this album by a die hard LCD fan. I found it to be different and odd. I guess it takes college age people to appreciate this type of music. I am 24 years old and even if I was still in college this would not be an album I would buy.
5,Completely passes the Wife and Kids Test,"I have a Yamaha surround system with a Hitachi TV. The family also plays a fair number of games on our slimline Playstation 2. Since it was easy to program the components to do whatever I wanted them to do, we now play the PS2 in surround.If I could improve anything, I would ask that Logitech include definitions to go with the infrared commands. A small amount of trial and error was all that was necessary to, for instance, get the proper surround setting for DVDs or for music.The big reason I give it 5 stars is because once you set it up (about a 10-minute job for me) people who have no idea about turning on all the various components can now just press one button and everything goes to town. This includes my 6-year-old son, who can only read a few words."
2,Tiny little Mushy Buttons.,"I played with this remote for the better part of two days to get the programming right. I never did get it exactly the way I wanted. The OK/SEL button just would not work, apparently not software just a mechanical failure. I am returning the unit. I can live with time consuming programming and even incomplete programming and maybe I would even use a replacement unit if it worked.But, I could never get used to those tiny little mushy buttons placed so close together. I really can't imagine how a company like logitech that is known for keyboards could produce a product with such poor ergonomic design and no tactile feedback at all. You really can't tell if you've pushed a button or not because they are so mushy. I frequently pushed multiple buttons at once by mistake because they are all right against each other with no space between them. Pass this one up."
2,It is very hard to update the remote due to software glitches.,"It is very hard to update the remote. Very seldom we can delete and if there are two DVR boxes remote get confused and keep on turning off and on, even though we choose the right one such as A or B.Software update is cumbersome and take 45 minutes on a Intel Quad computer with 2 G memory. Can supply some patches. I have the remote sitting on my coffee table useless."
2,Not Satisfied,"There was either no set up or the set up was improper for my Sony speakers and Panasonic VCR. For my Sony Vega TV there was no button to change inputs (from or to DVR, VCR and game). With no manual or instructions had to go online or call customer service to determine the button assignments for my VCR (still can't set time) and speaker system. Buttons are very small and it's almost impossible to use the device in low light situations without engaging the light button or putting on room lights."
2,Does not keep programming & LOW BATTERY LIFE,"I bought the 688 for its price and Logitech name. Customer service was good. I bought it in April 2006 so I have 9 months of marginal satisfactory experience with the device. Took me 4 hours to program, and I needed their help. Same problem with CD as others have reported. Remote does not hold programming, and it is too much trouble to reprogram. Worked well for a while now works spasmodically. Some times I have to resort to the cable remote or the remotes for devices to get desired operation. Battery life is poor. I have had very good results with Logitech support. They would send me a updated file for me to install.However, I wish I had spent more and gotten one with rechargable batteries and easier to read and operate controls."
1,Buttons too small,"Do not buy this device if your fingers are larger than a five year old's.I can not emphasize ""tiny buttons"" enough."
2,error city,"I read reviews of various books, and this looked pretty good. I bought it and started to use it, and was finding error after error, whether it was in a procedure or in a shortcut key process. The book is helpful in its tutorial set-up, but it does not cover the newest changes in 6.0 as thoroughly as I would have preferred. I am disappointed in it, but will keep it for its tutorials. I did figure out a number of procedures on my own. Maybe it was written with errors to test one's knowledge of Photoshop, but I don't think so. I already e-mailed New Riders about this. Try Visual Quickstart Guide by Weinmann and Lourekas- just bought it-excellent.!"
1,Sadly dissapointing,Between the errors and the fact that the book does not even get into many of the new tools for Photoshop 6 I'm very disappointed in Inside Photoshop 6. The tutorials spend an awful lot of space on 57 ways to make a drop shadow and neato things you can do with the demo software on the disc. In fact I would say a third of the book is really advertising for other software one can add to photoshop - most of it of very little value.I used Inside Photoshop 4 to convert to Photoshop from Photo-Paint a few years ago and that was a great book. I have the feeling it was fully updated for version 5 and this edition for version 6 was tossed together quickly with the advertorial content outweighing the editorial content at every stage in the process.
5,A Must Have!,"I found this book to be one of the most useful books on Photoshop that I have read. I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to get more out of their program. The author of the book not only knows what he is talking about, but he also has a wonderful ability to pass his knowledge on to the reader. I have used Photoshop for years and still learned alot from this book."
1,You can do MUCH better than this book!,"This is perhaps the worst software guide that I've ever read. The authors go on to infinitum about topics that are completely irrelevant to using Photoshop. All instructions are based on short cut keys, not drop-down menus - most frustrating if you are more familiar with the drop downs. I thought so little of this book, and found it so lacking it applicable information, that I actually tossed it in the trash! With all the supplemental documentation available on Photoshop 6.0, this should not even be a consideration."
1,Photoshop Student:,"I was hoping this book would shed some light on photoshop 6, but it does fall way short of perfection. First of all the book in writen for Windows, eh I can get over that. But what disappointed me the most about this book is the proofreading. I have found nunerous mistakes in the book. Some of the lesson get confusing because they leave out steps. I can't give this book a good rating for that reason."
5,An Australian Perspective!,"After reading The Last Thylacine and developing such empathy with the main character and tasmanian tigers, I realised why I couldn't put this book down. Terry has captured the true australian spirit most of us feel in our hearts by conveying our love for our native animals and our vast areas of untouched natural beauty.Terry has written a great paced adventure novel and very cleverly found a way to give readers an; Australian natural history, flora and fauna, photography and aircraft lesson all in one. I myself even learnt some things about Australian mammals.I have lived in Australia for my whole life (26 years) and can safely say I have not until now felt the need so strongly to visit Tasmania and explore this part of the world!"
3,A View of the Vietnam War Seldom Seen,"This is a book for someone who is deeply interested in every aspect of the Vietnam war and the cultural underpinnings of the communist forces there. The book's title is slightly misleading as it claims to be about the revolution and social change in the Mekong Delta from 1930 to 1975 whereas , in fact, the research and data presented is almost exclusively confined to Dinh Tuong /My Tho Province which had it's own set of circumstances which were quite different from other delta provinces such as Sa Dec or Cau Mau Provinces . That said , the book is filled with exacting detail and rare interviews of communist party members . This book (I have the Concise Edition) should be a welcome addition to anyone who wants a fuller understanding of the dynamics of the social and political changes that resulted in such a tragedy for all involved.Walter James (Mac) McIntoshFormer Chief Vietnam OperationsClandestine Corps CIA"
5,Super CB for a Small Car,"I purchased this CB to use in a sports car while driving in club events. It's small size was appealing and it fits perfectly on the console between the seats. I did not want to permanently mount it, as it is used in more than one car. The small mic is great and sits in a cup holder so it's easy to locate when needed. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a compact, high powered radio."
4,very good,"works very good, my only complaint is the mic cord isn't very long, your going to have to add a 12v plug for your cigarette outlet if you dn't want to hard wire it"
5,Love it!!!,"Has the fuse on the wire... comes with the mounting equipment, you may need to get some extra wiring to reach your car battery or fuse but thats it. With the PA switch (Which is what I use it for 90% of the time) its awesome. No regrets for the price, its a steal and exactly what I needed for a first time CB radio buyer."
1,EXTREMELY Poor customer service,"After 6 months of use, a total of 5 times, the unit stopped working. Uninden's customer service was the worst. On hold 3 different times. After 15 minutes on hold the customer service transfers call to a different department where I was put on old again for 15 minutes then it rang and went to voicemail, which is full!I will never buy another Uniden product again!"
4,Decent Unit,"I found that CB is not as useful as it was 35 years ago for travel. On a recent cross country trip it helped me find out what was causing 2 major traffic delays, but in both cases it did not give me a timely warning to avoid them. Still, it's nice to have as a back up."
3,Bad fuse,"Fuse blew out right when we hooked it up to the battery, did get to use the radio for a while because of that"
5,"Great, Durable CB radio","I have looked at many different cb radios for my truck. I was wanting one at a good price, not all of those bells and whistles that come with the high priced cb radios. I reviewed many radios and found this one to stand out in the small cb radio group because of RF gain and PA switch. I'm very happy with it. I set it up with no problems. For an antenna, i got a Wilson little wil antenna, 36"" but good quality brand name. I did a radio check and a guy on his cb said i sounded good. His 10-20 was a good 7 miles away. This radio is well built and knobs feel sturdy. No weird popping sounds like others have. Squelch and RF gain works really well. Speaker volume is loud enough, i didn't need to hook up an external one. Mic cord is not that long but since i have mine mounted near my cd player, it is the right length for me."
4,Good value for the price,"This compact radio performs very well. For a basic radio, it has good features, i.e. S/RF meter, switchable ANL, RF Gain, and PA. Used a top loaded Fire Stick antenna which tuned well, and received excellent signal reports."
5,CB RADIO,"The Uniden Pro is a great entry level and weekend warrior radio that gets the job done. Bought this to use at the base camp while up in the hills where cell phone service is limited. Has all the basics (volume, squelch, rf gain and more). Paired with the Wilson 5000 magnet mount antenna and you are set to go.(SOLD SEPERATELY)Radio is sleek and compact and mounts just about anywhere and runs on a 12 volt source."
4,"Some Things Worth Learning, A Plan to Consider","Charles Murray presents an alternative to the existing social welfare safety net, followed by an analysis of adopting his plan. The ""Plan"", giving all adults $10K per year, is an interesting suggestion worth considering.The ideas which make this book worth reading are in the final third of the book. This section is a thought provoking look at the welfare state. His discussion of happiness should help everyone to better understand their own lives. Murray draws from a classical view of morality described by Thomas Jefferson and Adam Smith and produces a powerful critique of Europe's social environmemt.Murray writes clearly. This book is a ""quick read."""
5,Great Book,"If you are a hate filled liberal hiding your insecurity and cowardice behind a phony veil of intellectualism, dont read this book, just give it 1 star and a phony review."
5,Genuine Worship Explained,"Hurtado has a more detailed version of this book, but since it costs around $55 (!!!) this short version may be better for your wallet. Hurtado makes detailed comparisons to Roman religious practice showing how Christianity did (and did not) fit in well with Roman praxis. Among the interesting trivia is that Christian rejection of the use of images and sacrificial ritual led some opponents to think Christianity was more like a philosophical association than a religious group [25]. Hurtado also explores in some depth the implications of Christian worship terminology and practice, and concludes with a chapter on the implications of his findings for Christian worship today. After reading this book, you may not recognize your next Sunday service."
4,Great Cupcake Pan!,I love this pan. I make Muffins and Cupcakes on a regular basis and this is absolutely perfect. I really hate metal pans because of having to grease them or use the liners and they always seem to rust or get stained of some sort. This is perfect and cleans so easily. I just need to buy two now! I would highly recommend it!
1,Very disappointed,"The main reason I got this was to make clean-up a lot easier. In all fairness, it is very easy to clean. However, I have used it twice, and both times I used it, it gave off a very strong odor and made my smoke alarms go off. There wasn't any smoke that I could see and nothing was burned. The plastic must give off something that affects the alarm. After it happened the first time, I was too nervous to try it again (the alarm scared my kids), but decided to try again last night. Unfortunately, the alarms went off again, so I am getting rid of this pan."
2,Crooked muffins,"I am not sure why no one else has mentioned crooked muffins, but that's my beef with this product! I love the idea, and love the sled concept, but something about the way the silicon pan sits in the sled turns my muffins lopsided! They all come out slanted and look puny and funky. They cook evenly and at the same rate as my metal pan (they usually go in the oven together), but my metal pan muffins come out looking fantastic and these come out silly.I'm going to replace this pan with a metal one so I can have presentable muffins and cupcakes in the future.For what its worth, the pan hasn't smoked the 2x I have used it, and there is no odor during cooking. It was purchased in June 2009, so maybe it's a newer version of the product."
3,Keep your old muffin trays,Hold onto your old muffin trays...This does not work as well as I thought it would. I sprayed the pan with Pam and my muffins still stick to the bottom.
3,"Not Godwin's best, but...","Father Melancholy's Daughter, its sequel, Evensong, and A Mother and Two Daughters are, for me, vintage Godwin. They set the standard for penetrating characterization and unsettling glimpses into how people really work. I picked up The Odd Woman with high hopes and was not utterly disappointed. Flickers of the good things Godwin will accomplish in later novels are abundant in this rather dense exploration of a ""spinster professor's"" running inner dialogue. If this is your first go-around with Godwin, however, skip this for the infinitely richer Father Melancholy's Daughter or A Mother and Daughters."
3,marginal playback quality.,"i purchased the j500 in order to record focus groups, but found that i needed to purchase an additional audio-cassette recorder in order to ensure that i'm able to capture everything that is said. i have a difficult time making out what people are saying when the recorder is placed in the middle of a fairly large boardroom table. there is quite a bit of feedback which makes understanding words fairly difficult. this may be eliminated by purchasing an external microphone...which will be my next purchase."
2,Buyer Beware,"I am not sure if it is my usage of this recorder, the tapes I put in it or the batteries. My recorder doesn't work anymore. The features on it are good, and it is certainly an attractive recorder. While it did work, I had absolutely no complaints. Unfortunately it isn't working now (and I have complaints).If I had to purchase another mini-recorder, I would go with a bigger name brand, just to be safe. It may cost extra money (as in a few measly bucks) but it is better to pay five more than replacing a whole new recorder.Lawyers will like the cassette recorders (and micro ones) but for the average person, I might even venture to suggest purchasing a digital recorder. Give it some thought, but whatever you do, be careful before you buy this one. I would not recommend it!"
1,Barely audible playback and poor quality,"This is definitely not a practical device.Regardless of what you read from other reviewers about quality and clarity, trust me, I've been using hand held devices for twenty-five years and this is the worst one I've had by far. I immediately threw it in the trash."
1,"BAD PURCHASE, BROKEN ITEM","purchased the tape recorder (refurbished and the sound when turned up all the way you could barely hear , so the sound was defiantly broken"
2,To Die For...,"Olympus makes GREAT digital cameras, but their recorders are to die for, especially when you interview someone and get back to the newsroom only to discover that while the tape was moving, the condenser mic had decided to go South on you and the only sound you hear is the motor and a weak, faraway voice. Cleaning and demagnatizing the heads didn't work for me, either, so buy a recorder with a blinking red light that indicates what you're recording is what you're getting.For interviews, spend the extra money and get a super quality product."
3,A mixed bag,"The sound quality here is about what one would expect. The only time it's a major problem is on ""We Can Be Together."" It's a wonderful performance of a song that (I don't think) is on any other live release. But someone must have been fiddling with the mixing console; at some points Jorma's guitar and Spencer's drums almost totally drown out the singing. The other negative here is that while Paul clearly announces that they are going to perform ""Mexico"" we then get a (very good) performance of ""3/5 of a Mile in 10 Seconds,"" a song already on several other live releases. Having said that, there are many pluses here: The Farm, a great version of ""Good Shepard"" sung by Grace (!) an ""Other Side of this Life"" with verses I haven't heard elsewhere and some wonderful stage banter from Grace. Airplane enthusiasts (like me) will want this one."
1,Terrible album,"Don't waste your money. I got this release for some songs that havn't been released on any live recordings. Mexico is listed but not played. The sound quality changes through out the cd. The preformace is awfull. Out of tune guitars,out of key vocals,sour notes played on guitar & bass. They were really wasted that day. There are much better live recordings out there"
1,Sad sound mix,"I was really excited thinking that more live Airplane was in my hands,....but the soundboard mix puts the vocals waaaay out front with most of the guitars lost forever.The show was a bit shakey,....and the mix put ""off notes"" and other troubles right up front. I am a major fan,and I can't deal with this well. So,who would like a very badly mixed recording of an off night of their favorite band? Come on,this show would be for you if you said ""yes"". Hmmmm......"
2,a very interesting topic presented in a surprisingly dull way,"As someone who reads etymological dictionaries (English, French and Italian) for fun I was expecting something more upbeat. This is an incredibly interesting topic - tracing a word's history is like tracing the culture of a nation. I am an academic myself, so I wasn't expecting or wanting this book to be dumbed down, but I found it extremely dry - so dry in fact that I quickly began flitting through the book in the hope of finding some interesting insights. If you've never read anything before on etymology or etymologists, then you might find it worthwhile buying the book. If not ..."
5,THE BEST NAME BOOK EVER,"CREATIVE , CREATIVE CREATIVE I LOVE THIS BOOK AND GIVE IT TO ALL MY FRIENDS. I AM A BIG FAN OF MISTER LANSKY. ILOVE THIS BOOK AND ALL THE CRAZY SPELLING AND MEANINGS..."
2,Bruce Lansky does it again,"...and that's not a big compliment. Yes,there are over 93,000 names in here,but in usual Lanksy fashion,the book is cluttered with ""kreativ spelygns"" and created names (the K chapter is one of the worst-Krystalee,Krystalyn,Kyler,Kylynn,Kymber,Kymberlin,etc). People who are interested in these type of names generally don't need help in creating names. How much more interesting the dictionary would have been if Lansky had focused more on names from other countries (they are included,but the ones I saw were found in other-and better-name books).I knew I was taking a chance when I ordered this book,but I was hoping for something other than Lansky's usual tricks."
2,Too much [stuff] in it to be helpful,"To fill up this bloated book, the author seems to have crammed in any set of letters that could pass for a name. It's about as much help as picking random Scrabble tiles. You can't read it like a book, you can't browse productively...it's no help at all for generating ideas. Sigh."
3,Hungarian names? Bogus...,"In this book the authors clearly wanted to boost the number of names as high as possible. After exhausting all the meaningful known english names (and apparently creating lots of new ones), they probably had no other choice than to ""go international"".All right, this opinion comes from somebody who is fresh out of Hungary - the bigger half of the names originated as ""Hungarian"" in this book are not from our language!Sooo... was the book still useful to me? Yepp, it got my imagination going... Meaning, it helped me to start inventing names too. So dear readers, how 'bout AMERIQ?(My wife went with a different name though) :)"
2,How About More Actual Ethnic Spelling Variations Instead of Madeup Spellings?,"As someone who likes to read name books and one of the first name books I ever read being an older book by Bruce Lansky and actually having liked it I can now see why so many people are disappointed with his books. It's all of the kreativ (Creative) spellings, there's just too many of them. I would actually prefer to see more actual bonafide foreign spelling variations instead. That is much more unique in my opinion. Taking a common popular name like Michaela, or Madison, and changing the spellings to McKayla, Makaela, Mykaela, Madacyn, Madasyn or Madecin is not going to make a common popular name sound or look any less common or popular or unique, it will just look like common popular name that is spelled incorrectly."
1,Beware of Missing Pages!,This book is a joke! It's missing 65 pages from girls names. It goes from P to V. Of course I am having a girl! I called Meadowbrook Press and they could NOT have cared less. They said that it's not their fault but the printers fault. I asked them for the name of the printer and she couldn't tell me! I told them that they are irresponsible since they published this book and it's MISSING pages!!! BEWARE OF BOOKS FROM MEADOWBROOK PRESS! THEY DO NOT STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCTS!
1,Don't buy! Complete? What about girl's names beginning with R-T!,"Thankfully, I bought this super cheap locally because it does consist mainly of spelling variations of some names, it is missing pages of girl names, and has some pages in twice!"
3,Good Start,"Chalker is a great writer and doesn't let up with this book. Although B's Serpent is clearly written to introduce characters and the worlds of 'The Three Kings' it is a compelling story in its own right. I would have liked to see more character development. Perhaps because Chalker is introducing characters who will play vital roles in future novels, we do not truly learn to fully empathize with very many in this introductory novel. Pretty good."
3,Smaller than I thought,Cute but small. Would be ok to add with other candles. Probably wouldn't buy if in a store. Not worth it to return.
4,The Underclass,"Auletta provides a thorough and sensitive study of the underclass in one of the most depressed neighborhoods of New York City. The book focuses on personal accounts of a job-training program participates, with nationally significant statistics to reinforce the message. The discussion of attitudes and politics driving the country's perception of the poor is enlightening and will provide material for heated discussion for those who agonize over the problems faces by inner city neighborhoods. This book is a solid piece of research and well worth the read for anyone interested in urban issues, racism, welfare, and the idea of a perpetual and permanent class that can not assimilate to mainstream society."
5,Cries from the Cross,"very good book ,anyone who wants to study the crcifiction would really do well with this book"
1,Could Not Hear Anybody - Squelch Defective,"Purchased the radio new, and installed in the same place my old radio was mounted.My first impression was: ""Wow is this thing quiet, compared to my old radio.""Well, that is because the squelch circuit was defective, and a person had to be within 100 ft of my car for me to hear them. Took it to my local CB repair shop, just to make sure it was the radio, before sending it back, and it was. The repair shop said this is not the first time they had seen this problem. Did not have anything to do with the Dynamic Squelch.Sent the radio back and received a refund.Never did get to run it through its paces to compare perfomance. Now I'm a bit gun-shy to try a Uniden 68 again.What I did like, was the good sound of the speaker, and the microphone. The front panel lights and meter were not too bright at night. Overall, had the radio worked, I would have given it a high rating.Just the luck of the draw, I received a bad one."
5,Super Duper,"I loves it, great price middle of the road radio, the stock mic is very clear. Matched it up with k30 mag antenna, flat SWR. No hum or road noise, excelent in simplicity."
3,Crafty crochet magazine,"Crochet World is more ""crafty"" than other crochet magazine and stays with more conservative styles in wearables. Some of the recommended yarns aren't my favorites, but you can always substitute and I sometimes re-imagine them to suit myself. If you like crochet stuffed animals, seasonal decorations, baskets, rugs, doilies, etc. this may be the magazine for you. Not my highest rated crochet magazines since I prefer more wearables and modern patterns, but this magazine has its own special niche."
1,Lacks style,"I have picked up several copies of this magazine at the newstand. I have not bought one copy. The patterns in the magazine lack style. They also use rather unflattering and uncomfortable yarns (eg scratchy hairy synthetics for ponchos). I have not seen one item that I would make.To subscribe to ""Crochet World"" you must enjoy making and/or wearing items such as a mulit-coloured jumper with crayons crocheted all over it. But if, like me, you cringe at the thought, check out ""Crochet!"" magazine."
1,Dated and Tacky,"My mother received this magazine when another (much better) crochet magazine went out of business. The remainder of her paid subscription was filled in with this magazine. Even in a ""crafty"" sense, this magazine is terrible. Every pattern is ugly and totally outdated. Perhaps these things would be considered ""cute"" in the '50s or '60s, but no one today save nostalgic grandmothers would consider making these patterns. Don;t waste your time or money."
1,flatliners meets hannibal rising,"Went into this one with tempered expectations, but was still let down. The implausibility of the story was remarkable; I came off my chair laughing when the professor expressed his concern to the main character regarding his extra curricular activities (drug usage, etc.) while totally ignoring the outrageous and amoral behavior of his other students in the pathology lab. Copious amounts of sex, nudity, drug usage, gore, and mayhem attempt to carry this story over the unbelievable circumstances, but to no avail. As one med student said to the other, ""be careful not to cut into the poop tube."" Unfortunately it's too late for us; this movie stinks all over."
1,Porn or Snuff,"Can't think of any better way to say it. The plot was almost interesting, but really it just seems like an excuse for nudity and killing people for no reason. I guess the point is to say people are animals and will do anything if they can get away with it, but this celebration in decadence and immorality was just overwhelming."
5,Delightfully Twisted! Weird and Fun.,"I would have to put this movie in my collection of really fun, morbid movies. The casting was excellent and Milo Ventimiglia was perfect for the roll of the protagonist. This was very unique as far as the movies I've seen are concerned. I enjoyed how things flipped upside down and back again and I could never really figure out exactly what was going to happen next. I would liken the mood of this film to Fight Club meets Running Scared (Paul Walker version). It's definitely not a movie for people who don't enjoy grossness, but it's not a gore-fest, either. Do watch this movie. I had a good laugh, not because it was stupid or funny, but just because it got to me at the end. And what an ending it was! I'm all smiles."
3,Pathology DVD,"The video is above average, but not as good as I would have liked it to be.However, the delivery of the product to me was excellent and I am very well satisfied with the service."
2,Pathology or pathological....doesn't really matter,"I was very excited about this film and could not wait to see it. When I finally saw it, what a disappointment. The character development is week, the story line is contrived and predictable...I've seen it done better. The gore is up there and for a gore hound like myself..this is the only thing that saves the otherwise directionless mess."
1,utter trash,"I just saw this piece of horror on MGMHD. Why I stayed to the bitter end is beyond my own comprehension. There are no redeeming features here. The one star I have awarded is one star moe than it deserves, but the system would not accept no stars."
3,Don't put in dryer!,This outfit got dirty over time and I washed and dried it. Big mistake. It shrunk to about half its original size. I am buying another one. Hand wash/line dry only!
5,Survived a whole day at a themepark with kids!,I used this to provide an ID band on a bunch of campers while on a trip to an amusement park. We wrote on each band with sharpie and even after entering the water park that bands stayed in great shape. Could not ask for more. They survived a whole days use of 7-12 year old kids at a water/theme park.
3,ehhh,product was as described and was sequentially numbered but I ordered 2 packages of 500for the same event and each pack was numbered the same. my fault thought I guess for notaskinf questions
5,Combining Modern Physics with Buddhism,"Edited by Arthur Zajonc, this slim volume is a series of discussions between five leading physicists and a historian have with the Dalai Lama. It's an attempt to bring together: Quantum theory, Doctrines, Religion - World Religions, Religion, Buddhism - General, and Cosmology.It is surprising to see how close the relationship might be. Back in 1962, Murray Gell-Mann began to fit the known elemental particles into a series of eight 'families.' Gell-Mann called this beautiful symmetry the 'Eightfold Way' after the Buddha's 'Eightfold path to truth.' This correlation or merger seems to have continued.In this book, the discussions are far ranging over the nature of matter itself, the experimental evidence, and the nature of the mind and its logic. It is not intended to be a textbook on modern particle physics, but it almost is. Well worth reading."
2,Too many duds,There were about six defective reeds in my box of ten. I was very disappointed and will not buy this brand again
3,"Great book, terrible print quality","This is a wonderful book, with a clear, concise and precise exposition of the fundamental idea in riemannian and semi-riemannian geometry. Although I would not recommend it as a first text, it will be the text that you continue to reference later, and turn to when you want the best mathematical treatment.However, I do not recommend that you buy a new copy. The print quality is terrible; the binding is poor, but even worse, the text quality is absurd. I have been using a library copy with cloth binding and sharp, clear text. It is obvious that the new printing in the green cover is based on a photocopy of the original rather than a new typesetting. While this means that no errors have been introduced, I found it painful to read. I would suggest looking for a used copy.So 5 stars for the book, but only 3 stars for this printing."
5,Excellent for beginner and experienced mathematicians,"This is one of the best books on Differential Geometry I've ever read. It includes a clear exposition of all the basic results and then goes on to the most deep aspects of the subject, making it useful for undergraduate and graduate students, as well as experienced working mathematicians. It's a pitty that it's no longer available."
4,"I laughed, I cried, it became a part of me.",Ever wonder how to mathematically model what goes on inthe vicinity of the sun? Here's the book for you.
5,"Great stuff, one of the best Maigrets",This is one of my very favorite Simenon novels; superbly paced and brilliant characterizations.
4,A man who crossed a barrier,"The Maigrets ate on a monthly basis with Dr. Pardon and his wife. Dr. Pardon complained that medical doctors were being changed into clerks because of all of the paperwork required of them. Superintendent Maigret and Dr. Pardon went out to see a young man lying in the street, a victim of stabbing. Maigret had become involved in the case involuntarily.In reporting the death to the family, Maigret learned that the young man's parents were very rich. The father was a perfume manufacturer. The young man had had few friends. He had an unusual hobby, recording conversations. The tape recorder was recovered.The tale is taut, lucid."
4,Not my favorite Bronn Journey recording but very good.,I have attended a Bronn Journey concert where he and his lovely wife performed. I really enjoy his music even though this is not my favorite collection.
4,Powderkeg,"This novel could be coined the X-files of the 1850's. There is suspense, intrigue and lots of action. This book is well written and tickles the imagination of any history buff."
1,Misleading specs,"This item is listed as having 4 gauge wire in it. It is no where near 4 gauge, maybe 8 gauge, but that's pushing it. I was replacing my 8 gauge with this 4 gauge to support a more powerful amp, but once I saw the lack of copper, I boxed it up and sent it back. I should have known it was too good to be true, since 4 gauge wire costs $2.50 per foot at the local audio store, so 20ft is $50 and this whole kit is only $30. Don't waste your time ordering this kit."
1,Not 4 gauge! More like 8 gauge with thick insulation!,"The cable included in this kit appears to be 8ga with thick insulation to make it look like 4ga. I compared it to a real 4ga and a 9ga cable I had lying around and the wire is only slightly thicker than the 9ga and nowhere near the thickness of the 4ga. If you buy this, you'll note that there are no markings on the cable giving the specs. Also, a 60Amp fuse will give you ~800 Watts max at the amplifier (60 amps x 13.5 volts = 810 Watts)."
1,This is junk....stay away,When the kit arived I thought it looked better than expected. The wires looked nice and as expected (from previous reviews) the wire was not 4 guage. The real issue I have is with the fuse holder and wire ends. The screws for the fuse holder are weak and I am not sure what size wrench you need because my SAE and Metric sets did not fit. The other wire ends are crimp style however it required my vice to actually crimp them. I really had low expectations for the kit when I ordered it but it did not even meet those expectations.
2,"... it works, but not great.","Okay the good part first. It does include all necessary parts to install a car amplifier. The bad, it's not 4 gauge wiring. It's the correct diameter but 50% of this is the surrounding protective cover. I would suggest this kit to somebody that is installing an amp 500 watts or less. If you're looking for big bandwidth wire, this is not the kit for you. The price and suggestion at it being 4 gauge is very alluring but be weary, it's not what you're expecting."
4,Get what you pay for generally,"I'm not complaining. This kit is exactly what I expected it to be, and it works fine. It's not 4g wire, more like 8g, but it's cheap and has 90% of what you need. The loom cable to protect the wires running through the engine is poor, but what the hey... it's cheap! I ordered two of these, and used them both with no problems."
5,Everything It Claims To Be,"As long as you don't need features such as Caller Id, this phone is everything you need. Excellent clarity and range--Uniden 900DSS is equal to or better than all 2.4G phones I've sampled (ATT, IBM, V-Tech). Compared with the 2.4G phones (and just about all other phones), this phone is a great value. Everything works well--and this is one of the few handsets with a mute function. My current Uniden has held up well. I expect this one will as well."
3,Decent for the Price,"Just bought this little 900 mhz phone with Digital Spread Spectrum. I like the clarity on both ends of the line. The size is more comfortable to the hand and shoulder than the V-Techs at comparable price and features. I like the extra space for storing and charging another battery. Only time will tell with any relatively inexpensive cordless, no matter what the features or the brand name. Good Luck!!"
4,Cute Dress!!,My daughter is crazy about her new Madam Alexander doll. So we got to shopping for dresses right away. This one is really cute and she loves it. It is good quality fabric and is sewn very well too.
2,Novella excerpt from Lady Slings the Booze,"This is a very good story, but I can't rate it above a two since it's actually a special edition novella that consists of an excerpt from Spider Robinson's full-sized book: ""Lady Slings the Booze"" (the second book in his Lady Sally's series).I'd recommend getting that full book, as this series is very entertaining, but reads a lot better if you get it all, and in order."
2,Sleek but Noisy,"The Uniden TRU246 is the latest in their series of 2.4GHz phones. It offers true 2.4GHz DSS transmission from both base and handset, which gives great security and range. I was able to walk halfway down my block with no interruption in signal. The lighted keypad, sleek design and silver finish give it a cool look. Unfortunately, there is significant background noise with this model. With my EXA950, a 900 MHz model, the sound is impeccable, there is absolutely no background noise. I called Uniden and they said a certain amount of noise is ""normal"", varies by model and is greater in the 2.4 GHz models. I find the noise unnacceptable, I am very dissapointed because the other features of this phone are so nice. You may want to stick with a 900 MHz model until they get this bug out."
1,There are better options,"I bought this phone to substitute a 900 mhz phone and after two days I am returning it to the store. First, the ringer has no off switch. You can control the volume, but some of us like to completely turn it off so we won't be disturbed at night. Second, I get a lot of static when I use my microwave, making imposible to continue a conversation. Third, it has no mute or hold button. Fourth, I thought I would get more range by buying a 2.4 GHz. That is not true. My 900 mhz worked better. Fifth, I get an echo of my voice when I am talking.I do believe this phone is too expensive for what you get and I found there are better options. I am sticking to a 900 mhz phone."
2,Good until the buttons stopped working:,"I was pretty happy with the phone until, shortly after a year, the buttons became increasingly harder to push. I've contacted Uniden and they said they would only fix it for free if it was a ""known problem."" Not surprisingly, they said this was not such a case. Now what I want to know is if anyone else here on Amazon has had this same problem? If so, let's make it ""known"" so that Uniden will either fix it for free or give us a replacement. Though at this point, I'd rather have my money back than rely on their products and Customer Service again."
1,Buttons stop working after a while!,"I loved the phone when I first received it. However, after around 4 months the buttons stopped working. I basically need to jam my finger about an inch into the phone in order to dial a number. It sounds like a common problem with this phone. I suggest staying away from it."
1,one picture is worth thousand words and the pictures in the book are worthless.,"I guess not much to add beyond my title. No matter what is the quality of the text the pictures totally disqualify the book.Similar title - Chest X-ray made easy - is printed so much better and one actually can see some detail. Additionally X-ray selection concentrates on massive pathology obvious to nearly anybody, even with minimal medical background."
5,Works well. No problems with installation.,"I installed it in a Dell Latitude: C400, Pentium III, Windows XP. A CD was supplied with the card; however, I used the latest software from Intel's website."
5,Works well in Latitude C640 with Ubuntu 7.10,"This card plugged into my Dell Latitude C640 and was recognized by Ubuntu 7.10 without installing anything extra. For range, it bests the Orinoco Gold 802.11b PCMCIA card I was using by a factor of 3. I'm sitting at my Toyota dealer writing this review with it now.The card did not come with any software, but I just Googled ""intel 2915abg"" (without the quotes) and the first listing was one click away from Intel drivers for Windows 2000, XP and Vista. I do not suspect driver availability is an issue for modern Windows.The only moderately difficult task of installing the card was attaching the antenna wires which are built into the laptop. The task requires small nimble fingers or some patience. Be sure to support the circuit board (don't let it bend) while pressing on the antenna wires.Before buying this card, be sure your laptop has an available mini PCI slot (not mini PCI express!), and that the laptop has a built-in antenna."
1,Intel PRO WIRELESS 2915ABG-802.11,"I was not satisfied with the range or the software offered with this card. I ordered this card to replace the original. My old external wireless used in the interem has better range, faster thru-put, and is more user friendly."
5,Awesome cream,"Great for cuts,burns and psoriasis. I've been using it for over ten years! It's better than anything a doctor could prescribe."
5,Addicted,"I waited untill I recieved this CD to be sure it was the same artists. I have had this album on Cassette for years. After I bought a new car, I was very disappointed that there was no tape player, and I had trouble finding this album on CD in the stores.This is Christmas Music, but I am usually burned out on it by Christmas, so after Christmas, I pack it away, but then about June I start craving the music in the album, so I dig it out and start the cycle over again."
2,Not up to Oneida's usual standards,"I just received mine and they look like Oneida seconds. The edges were poorly finished (for Oneida, though no snags or obvious rough unfinished patches) and quite a few have an off centered Oneida stamp.On the plus side, they are solid and attractively designed. They're a decent value at Amazon's prices and acceptable for everyday use."
1,Oneida Flatware - DO NOT BUY,"I also bought the 45 pc set. Rusted after the first wash. I have a filter and water softener so hard or problem water can't be the problem. I have had other sets for many years and never had rust spots. The quality is very poor and I am very disapointed with this set. I expect better quality from Oneida. This is the worst case of rust i have ever seen on flatware. If you buy this, you are buying junk. Andreas S Wanaque NJ 08/15/09"
4,Good but not perfect,"I like the style, weight and size of this set, but I'm not sure how it is going to hold up in the dishwasher. I've had it about a month and am starting to see some rust like spots on some of the pieces like have been mentioned in other reviews. We'll see if they get worse."
3,"Good price, quality OK","My main complaints about this silverware are:1. The tines on the forks are too blunt/squared off. Can make piercing food difficult, though certainly not impossible.2. The sides of the spoons' bowls are a big sharp.I expected better from Oneida, since the silverware I was replacing was Oneida."
3,It is not originally worth $200,"The set of flatware ohly worth what you paid. It is not as good as the description. The satin finish isn't shining, and there are some spots on the surface. Don't waste your money if you like shining flatware."
2,Not for hard water!!!,"I suppose I should have read the above review but...I washed the flatware in the dishwasher as soon as I received it. After just a single wash, the knives as well as some of the other pieces had developed pitted rust spots. I was aware that I had hard water in my new apartment, but I didn't think it would effect the flatware after only a single wash. And I'd never had a problem with the mishmash of flatware that I was attempting to replace with this set.If I had been able to wash the flatware without ruining it, I would have been very impressed by the pieces. They're sturdy and large. Unforunately, I had to return it."
4,Pretty Happy,"I have two little boys and somehow, my spoons seem to disappear. I am sure some dig of my home in a million years will have people wondering if we worshiped utensils. Anyway. I am pretty happy with this set. I didn't fall in love with it, but for the price I think is is wonderful. It has a sturdy feel to it and washes in the dishwasher well. There isn't much difference in the size of the dinner and salad fork and the same with the spoons, but I do think it was a great buy for the price and would recommend to others."
1,Tines on Fork Too Sharp,I got this on sale and thought it was a good deal. It wasn't. The pieces are heavy and huge. The tines on the forks are sharp. I wanted to return the set but the cost of the return shipping was almost as much as the price I paid so I kept it. I do not recommend it.
1,This set is clearly an irregular or a second.,"i've been using this for the past month and I wish I could send it back. The knives look totally horrible...they have streaks, rust spots, stains, etc. I called Oneida today & they said to send in the pieces which are affected. But, is it worth the trouble to mail these knives to be ""evaluated?"" There's no guarantee Oneida will refund or replace. The rep said depending on the defects (ie, if there's a manufacturing defect) they may or may not replace/refund. I can always donate the set to a soup kitchen."
5,What a breath of fresh air!,"Every once in a while, a mathematics book comes along that gets it right. While most math departments are filled with irrelevant, arcane texts; every once in a while a text will appear that is genuinely fun to read. Casella/Berger's fantastic statistics text is one of these; Pugh's Analysis is another one.I cannot overstate how much I enjoyed this book - no matter what book your math department is using for undergraduate analysis, I would recommend picking this one up and reading it on your own."
2,Very Un-enlightening,"The book takes a very direct approach to mathematical analysis, and while it says it is an undergraduate text, beware, it means a UC Berkeley undergraduate text. A lot of the proofs seem to be very un-intuitive and just using very high powered theorems."
2,Disappointment,"Lots of pages were missing from the book, I am very disappointed about the quality of this book, it should have not been in circulation or for sale."
1,Crapola!!!!,"This is a low budget stupid film about a girl who calls herself ""Goth""...yes, I'm talking about her name not her favourite type of music. This movie is just pure cheese, horribly written, horribly acted, terrible effects, ....no, it isn't scarry, and it sadly isn't even funny. It's unbearable!!!!!!!!! It's so hard to sit through that it almost seems like the justice department should use this movie as an interrogation tool for criminals. Awful movie. Possibly one of the most worthless pictures ever made."
2,uhhh,"alright first off, yes this movie was shot with a hand held cam. it was shot in my own and i was in it at one point. they cam rolling into town acting like they were soem big shot holly wood producers asking for extras and i got drug along for the ride, the people in the movie actthat way in real life and it's extreamly sad but hallarious. when i saw the movie, my first thoughts were, this sucks, but i'll give them credit for trying considering there were only three ppl besides the actors involved in making this movie"
2,About half way through I asked myself,"Who is driving the van. I mean seriously, I am watching this to see who is driving the freaking thing. It is irritating me to no end. I mean who is driving the van! Oh, yeah, it is worth watching in parts over several days 5 minutes at a time. Other then that you might want to claw your eyes out with a dull spoon. I really want one of those self driving van."
3,look at it for what it is,"okay, if you press play expecting hollywood special effects and shots made with $5000 dollar cameras you will be disappointed.but if you watch this movie expecting a film about stereotypes, naivety and the malleability of the human mind you'll love it.this is a movie that needs to be looked at for its story, rather than its production values. if you like overlooked movies that could have been better with a larger budget, but still hold some merit, this movie will be worth at least one watch[and the music video on the dvd by erace doesn't exactly suck either]"
1,total crap,This is complete and total crap. I bought and watched it because I didn't believe the reviews saying how bad this movie is. Save your money and save your time don't buy or watch this movie.
1,What are the three rules of Goth Club?,"1) Embrace the Darkness.2) Live for death.3) Never, ever talk about Goth Club.and don't tick off teamsters on the film crew because they're the ones driving the van!"
1,I only rated it a 1 because there was no zero!!!!,"This movie was one of the biggest wastes of time I've ever been subjected to....Not even ""B-movie"" quality....terrible dialogue, minimal plot, uninteresting actors, and laughable (if they weren't so bad) effects/sets.....There is a ""corpse"" in the first scene which is obviously a dummy....! Don't even think about renting this!"
2,pathetic,"I expected to find some part of this movie enjoyable, whether it was even the costumes, the music, the storyline, something. I found not one thing decent. It was a total waste of money, the characters were pathetic, the acting atrocious, and bored me from the beginning to the end. It was just stupid. I expected something better from Brain Damaged Films, but this ISNT it. Dont bother wasting your money buying it. Rent it first so you will save yourself the frustration I feel for having paid hard earned cash for trash like I did."
1,what is it?,"Lots of missing info: what are the dimensions? What material is the ""gold"" actually? How do you expect anyone to buy it with such missing info. PS, the supposed seller, CLE contact lenses, has no information on this item!"
3,good quality but missing...,"it's in good shape, nothing wrong with it, but the one thing I was really looking for ""general orders"" is not in the book, it's weird too, it's mentioned but not listed or explained, disappointing but not the sellers fault"
5,Excellent Resource,"This most recent edition is an informative manual for the ways and works of today's US NAVY. Reading this book before reporting to RTC can be greatly helpful. Highly recommended for new recruits, those in the DEP program, or those who are curious about the formal workings of the US NAVY."
4,curious about enlisting,a great read to see what kind of knowledge and techniques you should know before and after going to boot camp for the navy. It is also a great read for anyone who is interested in possibly joining. great price and fast shipping
5,Awesome!,The Bluejackets manual came really fast and was in perfect condition. I'm glad I was able to replace mine that was stolen many years ago.

5,Great Product and great customer service,I'm enjoying the product I received and am very happy with the customer service. I will do business with them again.
1,Wireless Keyboard & Mouse,"Sorry to say mouse didn't work right, it would lockup at any time and also run the batteries down when not in use. I had to return the product which was suprisingly easy."
1,Awful,"The product simply did not work. And the Gear Head tech that I spoke to could not offer any insight as to solving the problem(s) other than remedies I had already tried. A case of getting what I paid for, I guess."
4,Great Insightful Information,"This book is short stories of managing relationships. A self help type book. Great because everyone has time for a short lesson! You can read a section a night and feel you have gained valuable insights into how others manage their relationships. Easy reading, flows nice.LPsLL"
1,Do Not Buy This Book,The characters are shallow and predictable. The author has no concept of good fiction.
2,Disapointing sound quality,"I bought the L400 and 500 recorders, and am disapointed in the sound quality with both. The 500 had a real ""tinny"" sound, and unsuitable for dictation. The 400 has a loud motor whine on playback (which doesn't happen if I play the same tape back on a Sony recorder), and a similar tinny sound. Olympus recorders seem to be well constructed, compact, and great gadgets. But, the sound quality is inferior, and causes me not to recommend them until Olympus makes this better. My various Sony recorders are so far superior in sound quality that Olympus should be ashamed. Is my experience unique?"
4,Fun & Educational,"This was a gift for my 4 year old, who loves dinosaurs. He really enjoyed wearing the protective glasses and chipping away the sand to uncover the dino bones! He needed a little help getting started. We tried to guess which dino we were finding as we chipped away. Once we uncovered it, we went online to get more information about the dinosaur that we found. It was fun and educational. We are saving the glasses and tools to explore other materials in our backyard. Cool gift for a future archeologist / palentologist."
2,Did not really like the sound,I find it hard to make a realistic owl sound with this call. I like the hoot flute much better. I find with reed type owl calls that it is hard to make a good owl hoot.
5,Clear sound and durable,A friend of mine let me use this when we went bird watching not that long ago. Got a big owl to come to the tree by our cabin in about 15 minutes. That was a beautiful animal.
3,Good answerer -- lousy speakerphone,"With this phone we have 5 cordless phones in our house. The answering machine function works well and is easy to use. The cordless phone has good range and works well.Where the phone really falls down is as a speakerphone. It is by far the worst speakerphone I have ever used. You must stand about one foot away from it and yell for the other person to even hear you. About the only thing it is good for is to yell ""hold on while I look for the handset"". This may be a defect in just this one phone, but I didn't want to go through the hassle of sending it back and likely get another one that is the same or worse.The other annoyance is the ""Ringer Volume"" switch on the base unit has two settings ""loud"" and ""off"". With ringer on it is loud enough that it will startle you if it rings when you are standing anywhere near it."
2,Uniden EXS9950 Digital 900MHz DSS Cordless Phone,"This phone operates very well as an answer machine. The sound quality is good, not great, but better than the cheapo brands out there. The range is excellent and it stays clear all the time. The speakerphone is low fidelity but it is not annoying. I have one really annoying problem. My portable picks up the most annoying hum depending on where I am in my house. It sounds like 60hz line interference. I exchanged my phone locally in the hopes that it was just a defective unit, but no luck. I have had three other cordless phones that never exhibited this problem so I have to attribute this to a poorly designed unit. I have to be careful where I move or else the hum comes right through and can be heard by both parties. What is the point of a portable if you can't move around??? Very disappointed!"
1,"hmm, not the highest quality phone","... the battery on this uniden doesnt last more than 8 hours when its away from the base, and ive had it less than a year! the signal is pretty weak too and theres a lot of static/noise on the line when in use..."
1,Pikachu Birthday Card review,"Yes,there is a Pikachu brithday card and no,it's not that you think. This meant to be a attack card. You see if it's your brithday,you can flip a coin and if it lands on heads,it does 80 points of damage and if tails, it only does 30 points of damage. If it's not your brithday,it only does 30 points of damage without flipping the coin. Making a brithday theme battle card is one of the worst ideas they ever had even with a big name like Pikachu. It's Bugs Bunny's Brithday Blowout only in card form. It's only truly useful on your brithday. What's stopping them from using the 80 point coin flip attack on a day that's not on your brithday? How can the card even tell that it's brithday or not? STUPID YOU'RE STUPID!!! I give this card a 1 out of 10."
5,An In-depth Story of the Black Power Movement in Guyana,"This deep history of the Black Power movement in Guyana asks us to consider how labor movements of people of color in the early 1970s informed a rethinking of Black self-determination in the face of the reorganization of governments toward ethnic pluralism under capitalism and empire. This study is not merely about Guyana and the Caribbean but mirrors developments in Africa and among African Americans as well. Matthew Quest's introductory essay places Eusi Kwayana in conversation with the thought of the Pan African CLR James. But perhaps Kwayana should be seen as also a kindred spirit to James Boggs, the Detroit based African American autoworker, who examined racism in relation to the class struggle and critique Black capitalism as a myth and irrational basis of Black freedom in the same era."
5,Autonomous Movement of Workers in the Caribbean,"Eusi Kwayana's book documents and early 1970s movement of Afro-Guyanese bauxite miners in confrontation with their government and their union. Kwayana highlights the direct-democratic methods of organization and communication in the form of popular assemblies, which were initiated by the workers themselves. A forgotten classic and a must-read for any fan of Caribbean history or radical labor history.Readers who like this work should also seeInternationalism, Pan-Africanism and the Struggle of Social Classes: Raw Writings from the Notebook of an Early 1970s African-American Radical Activistby Modibo Kadalie."
2,Editors really screwed the pooch,I have only read 3 chapters so far and it is very apparent the editors were asleep at the wheel on this one or they rushed it into print. There are far too many grammatical and spelling errors to count. I'm sure people buy this for class rather than pleasure reading but still it gets rather annoying.
2,Mixed Bag,"Some of the recipes are good (the ""beefy turnovers"" came out quite good). But some were so bad I had to wonder who tested them. The Tuna-Spinach casserole was awful (my 6 year old would not eat it, and I don't blame her). And the easy apple cake was easy (true) but way too sweet. And don't try the Fast Fried rice with instant brown rice--it is a complete fiasco (ok--that could be my fault, I should have stuck with the instant white). Overall, a dissapointment for a busy parent looking for some easy recipes a kid would eat."
3,Cheese Whiz?,"Someone tell me, is instant rice, chopped frozen broccoli and CHEESE WHIZ really healthy? If so, I have been doing family meals all wrong!The book does have some so-so recipes, but they aren't anything that I cant come up with on my own. There are no pictures which makes searching it as exciting as watching paint dry. It is just a major disappointment. I think people who would benefit from this book are people who tend to do fast-food or frozen food a lot, because these recipes are very easy and quick and a whole lot better then a happy meal. But for me, who loves to cook for the family, its just too boring and doesn't deliver on the healthy aspect.Pros: Quick easy recipesHas suggestions how to balance the meal (the key to a healthy dinner)Recipes are much better then fast foodCons: Not so healthy sometimesNo pictures"
3,"Pretty Good, But not Great","Decent recipes. Not gourmet by any stretch of the imagination, but they're pretty good (the Chunky Apple Muffins are *very* delicious!). However, some recipes do use heavily processed stuff like cream-of-whatever soup, cheez whiz, etc. Ick. :( It's very easy and takes just a few minutes to make a white sauce instead of using a can of cream soup. Not sure why the authors didn't do that instead, as it's much better - both for flavor and health - than the processed stuff.My biggest complaint is that the cover says that the recipes can be made in 30 minutes or less. Not true for all of them! I can think of several off the top of my head that take anywhere from 45 minutes to 2 hours. I wish they wouldn't have advertised what they couldn't deliver."
2,"Too much sugar, processed food....","This book was disappointing. For starters, if you're cooking healthy recipes you should not be using instant rice, or canned cream-of-whatever soup. And just because you're cooking for children doesn't mean you have to add sugar to vegetables!There are a few good recipes but borrow from your library first. I think the early Mollie Katzen cookbooks (Enchanted Broccoli Forest, Moosewood Cookbook) have much healthier recipes."
2,No pictures,My main gripe with this book is that there is not 1 picture. It makes it really hard to figure out what you are even making!
3,Very handy book for busy Moms.,"I haven't owned this one long but have already made several dishes. I especially like the Crispy Oven Drumsticks and the Taco Balls. The recipes are easy and kid-friendly without being loaded with fat, etc. I am very happy with this purchase."
2,Out-dated and disappointing,"Some of the recipes can be modified, but this is NOT a good book for healthy eating. I don't understand why anyone would publish this considering that almost nothing in this book contains foods I would want to feed my children. Maybe these recipes were relevant based on eating/nutrition standards of the 1950's, but kids should not live on ground hamburger meat. I was really hoping for creative ways to include vegetables and get away from the typical meat/starch/carb combo that is naturally attractive to kids. I found almost nothing novel in this book.The only saving grace is that there were a couple recipes (that I was already familiar with) that were healthy, helpful substitutes, such as ""ice cream"" made from frozen bananas. This really is a fantastic recipe that has a texture and flavor of the real thing, without the fat and calories."
2,"Pictures, please","Great book, but no pictures. Would add substantial value to see what I'm about to make - especially when I want to be sure it's going to appeal to my little one."
3,Mostly Recipes,"There's a lot of good information here. As a teacher of twenty-five years, and as a parent, I've dealt with more than my share of overweight kids, and read everything that comes along on the subject. And although this book is one of the better ones out there, I've been recommending the CD talk ""The Fat Kid's Diet: Stop Childhood Obesity In Your Home,"" available here at Amazon, to the parents who come to me with their concerns. It's brief, sensible, and right to the point."
3,"Quick or wholesome, but not always both","My family are really picky eaters so cooking something for all five of us is a chore. Some of these recipes are quick and some are nutritious. So far, only two rate as keepers. I'll keep trying but for now, this cookbook goes in the ""occasional"" file."
2,Not a great book,I bought this after reading the reviews here. I was looking for quick meals for families. I own many cookbooks. This was not worth the money.One thing that really bothered me was one of the soup recipes starts with using a can of soup. I don't care for cookbooks that use canned soup to start a soup recipe. Why bother!I think betty crocker offers better cookbooks for the money.
2,"Recipe Title ""Rice A Roni and Chicken""?",I can't figure out how 'Rice a Roni and chicken' made it into a COOKBOOK that I paid for.About the only interesting thing in this book was a recipe for corn muffins with broccoli.
2,Not the healthiest recipies,"I don't mind using bisquick or jiffy mixes but packaged soup mixes and canned soup have so much sodium. I'd have preferred to see use of fresh ingredients, they don't take long to prepare."
3,Not for everyone.,"I have been searching for a cookbook full of family weeknight dinner ideas and healthy foods for toddlers. I'm still looking. Although there is some interesting stuff here, including some tasty dips and a yummy looking recipe for finger sized breaded chicken pieces, I have to say I'm not thrilled. I feel like I have a lot of similar recipes elsewhere in my cookbook collection. Also, I'm kind of a food snob and many of the recipes that I'd like to try are not made from scratch. For instance, there are instructions for enhancing a boxed cornbread mix with broccoli. I almost never use mixes in my baking or cooking. On the other hand, if you need some simple and fast recipes because you don't really like to cook then maybe this book is for you."

4,Perfect for Young Professionals,"This is the perfect bag for a young professional. Its color combination is great, tan on the outside, with a burnt orange interior. The laptop fits great and still leaves room for notebooks, keys, etc. The only thing lacking is a good place to put the power adapter. It fits, but there isn't a specific pocket for it.I've received TONS of compliments on it and it makes carrying my laptop a breeze."
5,Great laptop bag,"I really love this bag. Lowepro never fails to amaze me with their product quality. One word of the wise, however. My Dell Studio 15 laptop barely fits. It takes me a good two minutes to get it in because it is such a tight fit! Other than that, I can not complain. I feel that my laptop is completely safe in this bag. And the pockets on the inside are great."
5,Another Great Simpsons Calendar,"Another year, another great Simpsons calendar. With the impending arrival of 2002, Matt Groening and the creators of the Simpsons treat us to twelve months of memorable Simpsons' moments. Extracting scenes from the show's many seasons, the ""2003 Simpsons Fun Calendar"" provides the user with colorful, glossy pictures that not only catch one's attention, but also captures the zany, fun spirit of Springfield's many denizens. If you are a Simpsons fan or know of one, this calendar will make a great gift during this upcoming holiday season."
5,Very pleased,"The rack was a little bit smaller than I had expected, but it's well constructed and works perfectly for me. the magazine holder is perfect."
1,"Very poor reception, stay away from any appliances","Well I bought this phone becuase I had a uniden 900mhz phone and it had awesome reception. I could walk to the local supermarket, go inside and still get reception. The only problem is the power pack died. So I figured lets get a Uniden 2.4 Ghz. Well I can't even walk out my front door without this phone getting choppy and making all sorts of noise. If I walk by the microwave, I cannot hear the other person at all. This phone is worse than my 900Mhz. Very dissatisfied, but maybe its just my phone and not the model. Take it for what its worth."
4,COMPACT - SHARP NEW COLOR,"Purchased because of UNIDEN reputation. Color is a silver/gray metallic. Phone is compact. A different feature about the unit is that, when you hang it up on the wall mount, it hangs with the keypad facing you. It seems to be working ok that way but just something different than cordless phones of the past. When you lift it off the base, you have to give it a half-twist to turn it around for its use. The sound on the phone when you first use it seems like an echo but is not as noticable after using it a few times. Am hoping it will give us service as other Uniden products have in the past."
3,Misleading title,"Basically, a collection of magazine-depth articles about a variety of topics ranging from industy jargon to education to internet radio. One topic that is oddly absent is ""The Future of Business and Design"".A few of the authors prognosticate superficially about their chosen subjects, but for the most part this is a book about current trends. Given the life span of most things on the web, this book will probably be obsolete by this time next year.For people just getting out of school or entering the ""online industry"" for the first time this could be a fairly enlightening tome. For those already in the field, I would say it's a fun read, but only mildly interesting."
4,It teaches nothing. But reveals a lot.,"If you're a newbie to the Web Development arena, step back. This book is meant for Web Developers who are already experienced with WebDev technologies and that has a professional grasp of their ability, so that they can exploit the ideas and potential this book has. It has very nice and clever ideas for web designs and can very well inspire the creative developers among us. But again, it won't teach you anything about web technologies, it'll mearly show you the door, you'll the be the one to walk through it."
3,Insightful? Irrelevant? Depends what chapter you're on.,"ad creation to typography to the latest lingo. With articles focused from beginner to advanced, print background to web design protégé, designer to project manager, ""Websights"" works well for that handful of jack-of-all-trades in the industry.For the greater part of today's design world whom are specialized, they will find a number of articles that offer tremendous insight and fresh ideas that they can incorporate. Leaving a number of chapters that can be appreciated, but are of no real relevance to today's digital designer"
2,Not all that,Book is informative with content of articles about the web but not really impressed with the collection of example websites or lack there of. The cover is nicely designed but if you are looking for a book with lots of examples and inspiration to draw from this book is not it. I don't recommend buying this book. Just hope that it is on someone's coffee table so you can browse it.
3,From one of the authors,"I'd agree with most of the comments above, I think the book is spread quite thinly across a number of areas, so perhaps doesn't give the depth some might need.At the same time at least some of the content is quite technical and will go straight over the head of a real novice.I think if you're a design student, a recent graduate, or someone attempting to get to grips with new media you'll probably benefit from this book.For the chapter I wrote... I think it's really geared towards people with a pretty good understanding of typography already, and definitely slanted towards those building large scale sites on tight/continuing deadlines for a wide variety of systems and browsers.And, for sure it'll be out of date pretty quick... but you can learn from our mistakes :-)"
4,I Love THE LIFE!,"This is one of the best vocal selections books I've ever come across....EVERY song from the show is included...it's practically the whole score. Some of the keys have been altered to suit more normal tessituras, and some alternate lyrics are given at the ends of songs. A VERY thorough edition, and a great souvenir!"
3,a worthwhile read,"I confess to not enjoying LARA'S LOVER nearly as much as the first book of the miniseries. Richard's plot line feels overblown, and crosses from something entertaining into reading soap opera. I'm from just the spot in Arkansas that the fictional town Lewiston is located. While Richards definitely captures the small town mentality, the good ol' boy system, and gossip with cleverness, sometimes passages of truth don't blend well in a fictional context. She was far more successful handling both plot and gossip, reigning in before going overboard, with SOPHIE'S SCANDAL, which I thoroughly enjoyed. Nevertheless, LARA'S LOVER is worth perusing, if only because it's one of the rare romances daring enough to make the hero an ex-con. And I can't wait to read the third piece of this miniseries. Recommended."
1,Unbelievable,"Okay, at first, I was all excited to read this book. But, the back of it is very misleading. I thought that it was going to be about a man finding out he was a father after several years But, I was completely mistaken. It was nothing like that. I guess part of the reason the story was bad for me is that I didn't get the first part of the series. And based on this book, I'm glad that I didn't."
1,What in the name of-?!?!?!?!!!,"ok, i just got this as a gift from my cousin, and i would just like to ask you: what the hell is this? i'd sell it (or even throw it to the ground and jump up and down on top of it) if it wasnt a gift. but since im nice enough, ill just let it sit on my shelf and embarass me every time i have a friend over. look, DO NOT buy this game. it is SO stupid."
3,Decent game but rent b4 you buy.,"GOOD: Lots of weapons to use; Interesting story; Cool and helpful sidekicks; Neat boss battles; Good character animation; Easy controlsBAD: Graphics are pretty weak compared to other xbox titles; The camera is not very helpful most of the time; Stupid enemy AI (there are cheap ways to beat the 2nd and last boss); Ending movie was too short; Horrible save systemOverall, the story and combat kept me engaged enough to finish this game. I'm not sorry that I bought it b/c I know I'll go back and play the boss battles a few more times cuz they're pretty fun. I would most likely recommend renting the game first to try it as most people either hate the game right away or they get interested in the story and have fun. One last note: the reviewer who says that there is no way to defend yourself in this game is lying, there is a block button that is essential to beating the game."
2,"Has Potential, But Ultimately Disappointing","This game needs work. The graphics basically stink, the sounds and AI are often annoying, and you can't save at specific points. The fighting is okay considering you can execute different moves with different weapons. And it's cool that you have some NPCs to help you through the game. Overall, I didn't find the game that much fun to play...I'm going back to Halo!"
2,Biiig disappointment!!,What a major let down. The XBOX is the ultimate system and this game has the look of an old pc game. Hesitates all the time and the graphics... eek! Pass on this one for sure and spend your [money] on something worth while.
1,Not a great game after all,"You've been reading in the other reviews how wonderful this game is especially because of the many weapons the character may wield. Here are the ""cons"" to this game and they are substantial enough for me to wish I had never bought the game. Combat is elementary, bland, repetitive and, at times, quite annoying. The graphics are not to the level one would expect with Xbox. The story is weak. The most annoying element is the save feature. You cannot save as you go despite the menue and the process leading to this possible conclusion. This ends up being one of the most annoying and aggrevating features of the game. This game is definitly not worth your money. Imagine a worse version of Obi Wan."
2,ALOT OF HYPE JUST NOT MY TYPE.,THE BEST THING THAT I CAN SAY ABOUT THIS GAME IS THAT THE CUTSCENES ARE DESIGNED EXCELLENTLY BUT AS WITH ALL ADVANCED SYSTEMS THESE DAYS ALL CUT SCENES ARE GREAT. THE GAME PLAY IS ROUGH AND THERE ARE ALOT OF GLITCHES AS WELL. PLAYING THIS GAME REMINDED ME OF PLAYING AN OLD PLAYSTATION GAME. THE IN GAME DETAIL WASN'T THAT GREAT AND THE GRAPHICS LEFT US YEARNING. THE GRAPHICS USED FOR THE WEAPONS WERE ACCEPTABLE BUT OVERALL THE GAME STUNK. I DEFINATELY RECOMMEND RENTING THIS GAME AND TESTING IT BEFORE PURCHASING.
2,"Is the title, dumb or alive? or is the people who buy it?","I rather think that it is a toss-up whether those who buy this book are the dumbest, or those who are inside it's covers. It was mildly amusing, but little else."
3,"cd great, dvd sucks","ministry's last good album. everyone likes houses of the mole, but i think it's just an attempt by al to go back to the formula that sold the most albums, but what do i know? this album heads in that direction as well, but i think it's a lot more original and has many more influences of different genres of music. after paul left, the music moved backward.anyway, the dvd part sucks because the only actual footage of anything is mostly just some cameraman in a vehicle shooting footage of run-down texas, with a few clips of al and paul saying crap about the then ""new"" album. the rest is an article about their comeback and when playing each song on the dvd function there's a different picture of the band and/or then-band members. the sound quality is supposed to be twice as good, but it sounds just as good as the regular album, which is already good quality.just get the album instead (which alone i would give five f*cking stars)."
2,Wha,"1st of all, the Author listed is wrong....minor point (right)...ok, I just read and took the tests at the end of Chapter 1 and 2...............NO CORRELATION BETWEEN THE TEXT AND THE TESTS.......this book has good info in the text of the chapters (I think...but how do I know it will help pass the tests?)....anyway, if you can read the Chapter text and then pass the questions at the end of the Chapter you are not only a Genius but also Clairvoyant, a Daja-vuist, and soothsayer all rolled into one...........ok.....so....book has info that I have not encountered elsewhere......so in that respect it may be helpful (throw enough stuff and somthing is bound to stick theory).....haven't finished book yet...maybe I'l just pass on the tests and be pleasantly surprised when I get done?"
3,WHY ( Does Your Love Hurt So Much),"My Mistake on (Tom's Diner).This song was originally done by Carly Simon and it was more mellow'rEspecially the instrumental part.I preferred the original, but it was only sold on albums when I searched for it.( yes,I'm that old)!"
4,HITS YOU WHERE YOU LIVE!,"Really good book! The last chapter on modernism would have been great @ the beginning of the book. Although Drew posed no real solutions to our ruined physical environments, (she does write about the ""New Urbanism"")Drew's treatise gives us all pause to reflect on both how we live & what we have settled for when it comes to our housing and living choices (or lack there of.) Read this & get angry & active!"
2,Late,It took more than three weeks to receive the book. I really do not understand why it took that long...
5,"Great, funny and enjoyable ,",shows real life problems with growing up and parenting while giving you an enjoyable funny point of veiw
2,Thick Textbook,"I'm usually a speed reader, and I enjoy reading more than anybody, but this book is awful. It has too much information than required for a US History course, it seems more like an Encyclopedia than a textbook. It is also written in a way that will have you thinking about other things every couple minutes, it's not engaging, it isn't easy to read, it's not well written. I think this is the first time I rate a textbook this low, but compared to all the textbooks I've read, and I've read quite a lot, this is the only one that seems to be impossible to digest."
4,new book but unwrapped,"Fast delivery. book was in great condition. my only problem with it was that the book did not have a plastic covering; it was not protected. Usually when I buy textbooks from Amazon, the books are always wrapped in plastic. So when I got this booked, I thought it was used."
1,Not the best.,"I purchased this book for a US History class. We are now half way through the semester and I find myself having to search other sources to answer the questions that the professor asks. The book covers many topics but the ""important"" detail seems to be left out. It seems as if half the book is fluff and the rest of the book is very loose explanations of the topics. The book gives a heading for a specific topic then talks about the topic very little, interjecting useless stories and references to other parts of the book that equally as ambiguous/incomplete that just serve to confuse the reader. If possible I would find a professor that uses a different book, if you actually want to learn something about History."
3,Wilton Cars Icing,"It would have been cheaper to buy the bigger containers individually. Wilton icing gel colors are the best, so next time I'll get more for my oney by purchasing them individually."
5,Love Wilton icing colors,"I made a Lightning McQueen cake for my son's 3rd birthday and this kit was awesome! Wilton icing colors don't affect the taste or consistency of the icing like regular food coloring and this kit made buying all the necessary colors a bit more affordable (not that they are real expensive individually). Just a heads up - it takes a LOT of black to make icing color that is ACTUALLY black, so if you plan on doing more than tires and a few lines with the black, I would recommend buying an extra black dye. Or just buying a tube of black icing."
4,Cars Icing,The jell icing was good. I made a cars cake and the red color was ok. I needed to add more red food coloring to make it red. Overall great icing set.
1,"Not a game, just movies","I used to own this. It's simply three Chaplin Mutual films, digitized poorly, and nearly unwatchable. Don't bother."
1,Thank you Rosanna,"Until I saw this movie, I never knew just how tough things are for these incredibly beautiful, internationally famous multi-millionaires."
2,A bunch of self-absorbed twaddle,"The film is a parade self-absorbed, shallow actresses who are out of touch with any semblance of reality attempting to sound profound. With this group even the most mundane issues require endless hyperbole with words like ""passion"", ""empowerment"", ""struggle"", ""the craft"", ""dignity"", etc. It's occupational existentialism for the vacuous.It's interesting if you want to see a first person confirmation of Hollywood stereotypes."
2,Pretentious and hackneyed,"This is a pretentious, hackneyed look at the meaning of life and relationships as told by a few Hollywood actresses. Firstly, it's hard to garner a great deal of sympathy for the woes and troubles of some wealthy film stars. Secondly, Patricia Arquette, the director of the documentary, makes it seem as though these actresses are full of insight and wisdom when they are really saying things that we've heard over and over again.Stay away from this one. There's nothing really creative or original about it."
5,perfect dvd,great price and great condition-shipped promptly there were no scratches and it played perfectly.i am very happy with my purchase
3,disappointing,"Maybe my expectations were too high, but I thought I was going to like this doc a lot more than I did. So much of it seemed so superficial--Arquette had a great idea but she doesn't ask the greatest questions and therefore doesn't elicit a lot of great answers. Worth watching for the dinner scene with Margolies and Hannah et al where we're introduced to the term ""f***ability"" and for the interviews with Winger. It will definitely confirm all your worst suspicions about what drives Hollywood, and I'm hoping a lot of these women move into producing and directing so we get to see something more on screen than Spiderman 3 in future."
4,"Fun, great work out, lost 10 lbs!",I am a former athelete that had finished physical therapy for an achilles problem. The PT suggested a trampoline. I researched like crazy and ultimately decided on this one. The work out is great- it is fun - I added 5 lb weights to make it tougher and boy is it! Suggestion - the video work out is short. I printed each activity (18 in all) and now watch Sportcenter while doing two minutes of each (except one minute on speed reps) My feet feel great and I have lost 10 lbs. Anyways the one draw back is an understated part of the directions. It suggests to check the legs before working out. This is a MUST! One of the bar legs come completely unscrewed after each work out! BTW - my 8 year old daughter loves working out while watching TV now too! It was definately worth the money!Jeff in Massachusetts
5,Great product at a low price!,"I was looking for a little exercise jogger for my children after going through two of the inflatable ones and I decided to get one that I could also use. They love to jump on it and I love that they are getting some exercise while having fun! The oval shape makes it great for doing jumping jacks or just bouncing side to side. It is lightweight and easy to move. The set-up took a little bit of time, but you can do it by yourself."
4,"A bit challenging to put together, but my wife loves it.","The product arrived in a marked package, which had been intended as a present. So much for the surprise. I made it an early Christmas present, put it together (it does take about an hour), and my wife loves it. We don't use the electronic monitor as much as we'd thought, but the extra size is a definite advantage."
3,not what I thought,"From previous reviews, I thought I would be using this a lot, but it was not as detailed as described."
1,Judging a book by its cover,"I have read and enjoyed this book in its original form, published in 1919. It is a tale of a famous chaplain and a famous regiment, the Fighting 69th, in World War I. The book is in the public domain.Whoever the publisher of this volume is didn't bother to do enough research, or care enough, to know that the photo of the cover of their issue is from World War II. It makes me wonder about the quality of the rest of the volume."
4,Good to have,"fast shipping, happy with that. these sockets would not fit in my aftermarket 20 inch rims, which is why I needed them, they require thin wall socket. im sure ill find some use for them."
5,finally got a brand that works,this has been such a welcome addition since I went through all the problems with a different brand and still have not got the issue resolved with the factory I can't list it cause they won't publish my review but I really am happy with this one I just got one of the other 2 that I was having a problem with they are not a UNIDEN the other brand is Venomous and they are still messed up after about 6 weeks at the factory service center
4,great cb for the money,I had the same unit that was in an RV I bought. I used that unit often as I went down the highway to get road info. and sometimes just to pass the time talking to truckers/other CBers.The 3 weather channels came in handy as did the push button access to channel 9 emergency when I came upon an accident in the middle of nowhere.I was very happy with this CB. That unit stopped working and was considering sending it to the Uniden service center. I saw the new unit on Amazon so I bought. The price was right and I couldnt be happier to have the same replacement unit in my rig.
1,"""WORST EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE"" WEST COAST MALL"" (SELLER)","DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT, Tons of background noise when using. Took for ever to arrive! Unexceptabe product, requested to return it within a week. Took forever to get a return email from seller ""WEST COAST MALL"" The whole return process took almost a month! after they had finally recieved it, it took another week just to refund my money! They also wanted to charge me a restocking fee of 20.00 and no return shipping OMG! I will never buy from ""WEST COAST MALL"" AGAIN! I suggest you dont either NITEMERE!!!!!!! 5-31-12"
5,Awsome,This is a awsome Bye. The front facing speeker is the best part. It is a vary durable cb vary easy to use and small enough to fit in any car with out taking up a lot of space. The Black face alows it to blend with any color. Thank you and God Bless
