2,coleman battery operated lamp,the bulb was missing from one of the lamps. Don't know what to do to get a replacemant bulb.
2,Not so great,"I chose these lamps because my parents had great success with Coleman products since the 1940s. I purchased three for our camp in the Adirondacks where the power goes out at least once a summer, and I didn't want the young ones using kerosene or candles.Unfortunately, the first time we needed them (1) even the best batteries didn't last, (2) a bulb burned out right away, (3) the bulb was missing from the second and (4) the bulb assembly fell apart on the third.This was about 12 years ago. Very disappointing as they were hardly used at all. Sounds like others are having the same problems...."
1,Terible lamp,"i have this lamp and it gives out bearley any light and to top that it is very very very very very ugly, this is a waste of your hard earned money"
1,Quality Control Bad on This Item,"The first lamp that I ordered wouldn't light. I checked all batteries, the light bulb, and the on/off switch. Nothing. So I ordered a replacement. The second one one lighted, but the on/off switch was defective and would not always operate. I conclude that if two lamps in a row are found to be defective, quality control is bad on the item."
1,LANTERN BREAKS EASY,"Years ago, this lantern was the best - but then they must have changed it somehow in terms of quality and each one I bought has broke (all four of them). After using them just a few times, the bulb suddenly pops up and out - and a small piece flies off - and they just bust- just like that. I'm not buying anymore of these - and am hesitant to buy Coleman anymore - it's just not what it was years ago. If it was not for this lamp breaking so easily it would be the best lantern."
5,What a fun book!,"What a perfect book this is for the Autumn. I couldn't wait to get home from work every night and curl up with hot tea and the next exciting story. I was disappointed that the book had to end. What a great start these new authors have. The story of Hattie's Head had to be my favorite. They are ALL great though. Enjoy reading this fun, fun book."
5,One of few last stories of Joel Ross,"Genuis level comic horror by Joel Ross and others. Ross, author of ""Eye For An Eye,"" died in 2010, after a stellar career in criminal justice, and an equally scary writing resume."
5,Hattie's Head,"Hattie's Head was very crafty, weaving suspense with humor, and the present with the past. The last sentence tied it all up in a neat little package and left me dumbfounded! I felt as though I were beside the boys on their hunt for Hattie. Kelli Campbell told the story so cleverly that I could see everything clearly and isn't that what a good writer does? They let you ""see"" what you read. I'm anxiously looking forward to more of this writers' stories in the future. She's on her way to success as a well known Horror Writer."
2,very thin glass,"when i saw bodum... first thought is stylish and quality. but when i opened the box, these glasses are thin and flimsy. within 2 days, i broke one of them. the glass fell and hit the sink as i was washing it under running water.for what its worth, it does seem to keep cold drinks colder longer. i just wish it was more durable."
3,It's Crashin,"I purchased this album because I needed a funky outlet.Im pleased with the album, but it left me wanting more. Then a friend told me that this album should not have been the first one that I decided to buy. Therefore, I have pushed on...So for you first timers out-there pick up Nasty Gal, or They Say Im Different ((((First))))"
2,Okay....but.....,"I must have missed the part in the description where these have to be hand washed. My hubby loves silky boxers, but he threw them in the washer, not realizing they were hand wash only, and they came out so wrinkled the fly would not stay closed. I know, they probably can be ironed, but who wants to iron boxers. Call me lazy......I thought I had the perfect Christmas gift."
3,The ghost is so pretty!,"This simple tale of a vengeful girl ghost has a woman unravel the reason the ghost is bumping off her former college friends. Nice visuals. Pleasant young actors. This is the only film that I can think of where I looked forward to the ghost's appearance cuz the ghostly makeup of Ha Ji Won, if anything, enhanced her exotic blending of sultry-ness and cuteness."
3,INCA DINCA DOO,"This is the third in the series of Woodworth's novels about the Violets, humans who can commmunicate with the dead. While it's an okay read, it is the weakest of the series so far, due to a lethargic pacing and redundancies in the narrative.Natalie Lindstrom, our Violet heroine, finds herself in Peru, to help a wealthy industrialist locate Pizarro's hidden treasures, ostensibly for the welfare of the world's museums, but of course, he wants it for the financial gain it will bring him. He kills Dr. Abel and has an actor, Augustus Trent, pretend to be him in order to lure Natalie. Of course, Natalie's young daughter Cassie is in jeopardy as well.The novel has some interesting set pieces and Natalie's interchanges with the dead are okay too. Just not up to snuff in comparison to the first two."
2,Basic Lessons in Archaeological Method Needed,"This would have been a good read like the previous Violet novels and I would have given it high marks for the Incan cultural content, but Woodworth needed to study archaeology too and he obviously doesn't know the first thing about it. How do archaeologists think about sites? How are artifacts evaluated? There's a major plot point that deals with archeology. Woodworth's lack of knowledge in this area, kills the credibility of his story from the outset."
2,Least Favorite in the Series,"This book has plot holes big enough you could drive a truck through and I found the lead character more annoying than ever. She has all these money problems but has no problem flying out for a 20 minute trip to see her father??? Hey, okay! There are lots other but I don't want to spoil the book for anyone. If you are into this series, you'll want to at least read this but if the next one is this bad, goodbye Violets."
2,Strictly Kata,"Poor sound quality. If you are a member of this style, you might be able to learn the Kata. But the instructor is not a good teacher of kata. After the first half of the tape, there is rote expansion of how the kata could be used in kata. This is not a substitute for a combat stick fighting video. I will be looking into escrima."
2,Not a very complete instruction video.,"Nitan Bo Combat Stick Fighting... according to the description of this dvd ""Each kata is expertly performed and every aspect of each weapon is completely explained including combative applications.""However, I agree with the review that says, ""Pitiful - One of the worst training videos ever purchased.""The dvd gives a cursory view of some movements, but it is as if the ""author"" is trading on his belt ranking and his reputation... but the general audience are not members of his dojo, and are less impressed. I don't know where the five star ratings come from. Perhaps they have a different video? After viewing the dvd, I came away with little that I could use.The author seems somewhat older than perhaps optimum, and this video might be more effective and complete were he to train a student to demonstrate movements more comfortably."
2,could be better,"This tape has several problems that one would think should not be. The first is sound quality. Alexander was not miked and you can barely hear him on the tape. When you can hear him his voice echoes through the dojo making him hard to understand.Another problem with this tape is the lack of a slow-motion performance of the kata. Although Alexander performs the kata at a slower pace, some of the subtle movements are hard to follow. In addition, his expanation of the moves is lacking. It appears as though there is an assumed base understanding of the kata.The reviews of the DVD are much better than the reviews of the VHS. Perhaps the slow foward options on the DVD help make up for the lack of a slow-motion performance. Given the option, going for the DVD may be a wiser choice."
5,Very accurate and effective!,"If you don't think you could effectively use 2 sticks to kick some butt,then just watch this DVD. I just watched it and the guy on the video wasvery informative, clear & concise. As far as I'm concerned, these techniquesare very accurate and appear to be very effective."
1,"DVD blank, returned to company five weeks ago, not replaced","I ordered the DVD over five weeks ago. I recieved the DVDand tried to play but it was blank. I called the company and they said to send it to them. They knew a batch of DVD's were blank.Over five weeks later I have not recieved a replacement, a letter or anything. I was ripped off. I would be happy to recant my statement if the DVD shows up in my mailbox and write a glowing review about it. So maybe this would get the company to send me the replacement DVD or send me a refund check. DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!!!!!"
3,Eat these cannibals.You'll be glad you did,"The thinking mans Bananarama, only they sing way better, have an outrageous sense of humor,wickedly funny lyrics and don't seem to take themselves seriously for a minute. Old New Wave you'll be sorry you missed the first time it came around.'Hey Rajah' and the campy 'Dracula Tango'are highlights,along with the better known 'I Eat Cannibals,"
2,Required Modifications,I expected a direct replacement one for the one that was broken on my Weedeater leaf blower. I had to modify the part I received rather extensively to make it work.
4,When You Believe,"Storyhill's self-titled Red House CDStoryhillknocked me off my feet. The lads' website offered information about the band, which led me to ""This Side of Lost"" from 1996. The same tight harmony vocals that at times bring to mind The Everly Brothers, Seals & Crofts and Crosby & Nash are evident. ""White Roses"" pumps with acoustic guitars, a tambourine and those incredible harmony vocals, ""You heard a song playing on the radio, sounded like something like someone you used to know, some old love song."" ""Mary on the Mountain"" is a folk track with a great melody, ""She's smiling when you believe."" ""Continents Collide"" seems so personal, like you're taking a walk inside the songwriter's heart. ""Standing on My Own"" has a warm sunny feeling, combined with some sadness. ""This Side of Lost"" is a strong set by this incredible folk duo. Enjoy!"
4,An easy read.,"This book was an interesting and easy read. I enjoyed the stories of the patients and it gave me some insight on schizophrenia. The book though left me wanting to know more about the patients and less on what she thought and her own feelings. She often made herself look like the one in need of help. Overall, it was a good read that I got through in 2 days."
3,Misled but Pleasantly Surprised,"I chose to read this book for my college abnormal psychology class. I picked the book from a list created by the professor with a description of each book. I chose this book because I was interested in the fact that the author was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder, and I was hoping to learn more about this affliction. Unfortunately, this book barely addresses Borderline Personality Disorder. Since the author, Lauren Slater, is a clinical psychologist, this memoir focuses on her patients and the disorders that plague them rather than her own diagnosis. I was misled to believe that this book would be more of an autobiography. However, I can't fault the book for my own misunderstanding. It was very well written, was easy to understand, and was interesting. Future readers should just be aware that the disorders covered involve schizophrenia, Antisocial Personality Disorder, and depression."
5,riveting book,"When I first read this book, I was training to be a psychotherapist, and to make sense of the new feelings and experiences associated with that role. I loved her attitude toward her clients--that it is a privilege to know your clients and to relate to them, that ""the border between the helper and the one who is helped is always blurry."" I highly recommend this book for counselors, counselors in training, clients undergoing therapy, and for those who enjoy memoirs. I have read this book many times--I appreciate how well written it is and how the author uses her own psychiatric history as a tool to understand others' experiences. Wonderful book!"
1,stay away from this one as single player,This has got to be the worst single player racing game ever created. The game claims all sorts of racing types but the box did not mention that you can't select what type of racing you want to race insted you have to progress through every type of racing before you can select what you want and unlike pro race driver you can not tweak your cars before each race! and you can't adjust the difficulty so as you progress the races are impossible to win! Stay away from this one as I do not recomend it. The 1 star is for single player only x-box live is fun and as for the dork above me I could name several games where all the racing types are ready from the start.
4,too bad about the typos,"The stories are great, of course. They are real stories, with plots. But since when do Library of America editions have typos? They bugged me so much that I sold it to a second-hand bookstore. It appears that Microsoft spell-check was run instead of hiring a proof-reader."
5,glorious writing,"There is something magical about Singer's writing. It is so simple, so effortless, and yet so profound. I devoured all three volumes of the Library of America Singer short stories, and have gone on to several of the novels, as well as the children's stories. I am sure I will be going back to the short stories again and again, for the rest of my life."
1,Mac Users Beware!!!!,"I recently bought this camera through this website. After extensive research, I was won over by the other review here that tells of the ease of use with Macs iMovies because we were planning to purchase a new iMac. Well, the new computer is here and after several days of frustration I have learned that this camera will only import video to macs with OS X 10.1-10.3. Lo and Behold all new iMacs are loaded with OS X 10.4 and this Camera is totally unable to communicate. The folks at panasonic are alternatingly clueless and unhelpful after waiting on the phone around 20 min. and they don't plan on releasing and drivers to make this brand new model of camera compatible with the brand new model of operating system!!! I am at my wits end and out 800 bucks!!!!!"
5,good deal,it was very good product and ilove it because i like the mini dvd camcorder it is very highy qualePanasonic PV-GS250 3.1MP 3CCD MiniDV Camcorder w/10x Optical Zoomty
4,Nice little camcorder - performs up to advertisement,"This has turned out to be a pretty good unit. I have filmed a wedding with it and taken many stills at night and in daylight. The stills come out well if you have plenty of light. They don't work as well in low light. The flash works well for the stills. The SD card seems to need a reader to download the photos all at once, unless I missed something (very possible) in the manual.The camcorder has excellent quality, as long as you have minimal lighting. When it gets to real low light, it is not such a great performer. I was not expecting it to work well in real low light. It works excellent in outdoors and in moderate light.It is essential that you have a tripod when using for any important projects.I bought Adobe Essentials (cheaper at Costco than at other stores -$79) and it works well with this camcorder. You can exceed your imagination with this software. I recommend it too."
5,Stop Reading These and Buy This Book,"If you are a Windows programmer, then chances are you use MSVC.If that is the case, then you owe it to yourself to buy this book. I've been using MSVC for five years now, and I thought I new a lot of the tips and tricks, but Mr. McKay is like a god...In addition there is a lot of useful hints and tips on debugging any type of program (not even necessarily Windows programs.) A good book with good ideas for lots of people.My only regrets are:A) This book did not come out last year. B) A large portion of this stands to be out of date with the coming of Visual Studio.NET (this is just a fear I have, I haven't taken a look at the Beta yet, so I don't know.)This is one nerd book I am happy to have purchased and read (other books I'm happy to have stumbled upon and read are ""Effective C++"" and ""Essential COM"", if that gives you a feeling for other books of a similar quality in my mind.)"
2,Bad Print,I bought this book and was so shocked to see the print quality of the book. All the left inside pages had incomplete sentences due to print. Not only this the words break into next sentences. I have never seen such a bad quality of print in my life. The font is pathetic. I have to say this but I can guarantee the technical writers/review did not review this book after the print because its impossible to read the pages beacuse the sentences are incomplete and words left out b'cos of mis print.Is this only my copy or every copy has this problem. Can somebody confirm this? I am surprised how anybody has not noticed this?
4,Very good but a little dated,"This is a very good book, although it is now a little dated. The explanations on customizing watch windows, and tuning default step over behavior has already payed for itself in terms of time savings."
4,why not before?,Don't know why I didn't get this before!! great cd. Great vocals and guitars.. thanks.
1,Boring. Nothing special here.,"Sorry folks. I'm a big Boston fan but this effort falls flat compared to ALL other Boston released. Not compared to anything else, yeah this rocks but its boring. Nothing really special, not the energetic stuff you'd hear from Bostom album."
4,Barry Goudreau - Self Titled,"1980CBS RecordsWith Brad Delp Of BostonSongs Include :""Hard Luck""""Nothing To Lose""""What's A Fella To Do""""Mean Woman Blues""""Leavin' Tonight""""Dreams""""Life Is What We Make It""""Sailin' Away""""Cold Cold World"""
1,vague & confusing,"As a sewer with 30 years of experience I was able to figure out the instructions in spite of those in the book. A beginner would have great difficulty. Side bars thruought state ""EASY"", ""FAST"", ""FUN""... none of which I experienced. The chinese take-out box I made is very nice, but having to zig-zag stitch around the edge of the box 2 or 3 times proved VERY tedious. After you've made one, they are relatively easy, but not FAST and certainly not FUN."
1,not fast or fun or easy!!!,"i agree with all the people that wrote the reviews. i found this hard, difficult and very upsetting and i still don't get it. they want you to buy their products for these boxes that aren't cheap and i have different products in the area i live in and i am just trying to do one correctly and get it done with all of the extra material i have and i can't seem to do one correctly. the directions are hard and very hard to understand. not clear at all. i am still trying to figure which part to put the material to. i bought a double sided adhesive and i just can't tell where to cut the material out at. very hard for a beginner. tracy"
4,Fabric Boxes,"Fun looking projects, great color photgraphs. Explicit & detailed instructions. Still don't look ""fast & easy"" but I am not a detail person. Someone who loves to do intricate work would love it."
2,no time for fabric boxes,Wasn't exactly the book I was looking for. I will probably donate it to our book mobile.
1,"To call this a ""Game Programming"" Book is a farce...","While not THE worst Java game programming book I have seen, it certainly is one of them. This is a 2003 title which adds practically nothing that hasn't been available for free on the net since '98. If you are looking for a legitimate guide on Java game dev, the book these two jokers have written is certainly NOT it. Short and sweet, this is a complete and utter waste of time."
1,Have the authors actually used Java to develop games?,"I own every Java game book printed. This one was worthless.What little material that the authors devoted to genuine game development seems to start with the assumption that none of Java's native facilities are sufficient and therefore, in the book, they attempt to re-invent the facilities. As you try and follow the coding pitfalls that the authors get themselves into, the emerging code appears to be based upon a programming model that was lifted from classroom-provided C++ code and techniques."
4,Brilliant Primer for Java Games,"I bought this book in the hope that it wasn't going to be another so called beginners book that ends up sitting on the bookshelf forever because the content is actually aimed at someone with core knowledge and therefore skips out all the basics.I wasn't dissapointed, the whole of the first half of the book is given over to getting you up to speed with core information and from there takes you by the hand and leads you through key game techniques which have helped me to create my own applet games to put into my web site.I would highly reccomend this book to anybody who needs to get a solid grounding in the basics of Java game programming. It may not be for those who already have some knowledge of Java but for those of us who are beginners it's an excellent source of information and reference."
4,Beautiful word of God!,"I love this Bible! It is my first Leather bound Bible. It is so much easier to carry around then a hard cover one. The extras in the Bible are very inspirational, and really help in studying God's word. It is a touch on the big side, but the extra's that this Bible has to offer women are worth it!"
5,Women of Faith Study Bible,"I wish there hadn't been so much underling in this particular copy but thank goodness, most of it was in pencil which I erased. The study notes on every page are what make this version so valuable to me and is the reason I choose it as a gift to new Christians. The study notes have been so enlightening to me."
5,NIV Women of Faith Study Bible,"Prefer hardcover over soft cover. I have purchased for myself, friends, co-worker, aunt, & mother. They all agree it is easy to read and has a pretty cover. (I ask 1st whether or not they would like one.)"
3,Good for beginners,I have been reading the bible for a while and I got this one as a gift. It has a lot of inspirational quotes and some scripture in the margins. Only half the page is the actual text of the Bible. The opening descriptions of the books are not very helpful but I like them to include the jist of the book. It's very womenly and talks about different famous women. It's colorful and with pictures of women and flowers. The subject guide in the back only has page numbers for subjects.
5,Great study Bible,Excellent book for womens group or for a person starting their walk of faith or continuing their walk. This Bible is easy to understand an use. I love it!!!!!!!
3,BEAUTIFUL BOOK,"I BOUGHT ONE AND THEN I BOUGHT ANOTHER AND THEN I BOUGHT ANOHTER, AND I'M THINKING ABOUT BUYING ANOTHER ONE. THIS IS THE BEST BIBLE I'VE EVER BOUGHT, SO I BOUGHT ONE FOR A COUPLE OF MY FRIENDS AND I'M THINKING OF BUYING ONE FOR ALL MY FRIENDS NOW. THIS IS THE MOST GRACIOUS BOOK YOU WILL EVER PURCHASE."
2,Wemon of faith review,This revision of the bible is hard to find where your at in a quick glance as the book names are in the middle of the pages instead of on the edges.
1,AWFUL,I wouldn't know how the product is because I never got it! I am very upset....i t supposedly got lost in the mail. Now I probably won't order from amazon ever again.
5,Love this study bible!!!,This study bible is perfect for women who want to learn more from the bible. There are useful sidenotes for most of the chapters that help one to understand and truly get to the meaning of God's word. This bible has made my personal bible study much more meaningful.
1,"Poor Product, worse customer service","I purchased this item 8 months ago. At first it worked great, and it died two weeks ago. I called RCA for assistance and their customer service was poor. They can not look up product registration and they told me that I would have to use the receipt as the only means of proving when I purchased the item. I have one of the first model year DVD players that still works by Sony, and it still works like a charm. I purchased this item for it's price, just to find out it has an 8 month life expectancy, and RCA won't stand behind their product. I will never purchase RCA again, and encourage many others not to purchase RCA either based on experiance."
1,"This is not a good buy, I suggest buying 49 dvd movies inste","I got one for Christmas, it recorded great and all. But, we have come to find out that you CAN OMLY PLAY YOUR RECORDINGS on THIS DVD player.Well, that's just stupid and a waste of money. I could buy 49 dvd movies for what was paid for this machine and I could watch them on any dvd player.I'm switching back over to recording on the VCR, because it's much more versatile. My freind works evenings, so I record survivor, then we got together on the weekends and watch it. NOT ON THE DVD anymore, I will take a tape next time!!!!!I'm completely disgusted with this and I am trying to make RCA give my freind a refund. In my opinion, THEY RIPPED HER OFF!!!!!!!!!!"
2,only had the unit for 2 weeks,"this unit has been the worst for the money.. i already had the remote control die, and it hard to shut off when it is on a timed recording!!! the customer support for RCA was a bunch of jerks to me, but i finally got them to send me a new remote (supposidly).. still waiting for it.. i won't buy any more RCA PRODUCTS after they way they treated me and screwed me around.."
2,DVD+R No longer works,"I have mixed reviews on the RCA DRC8000N. After about two weeks, it completely stopped recording DVD+R discs, though it would play back ones I previously recorded. I used Memorex and Sony. I tried a DVD lens cleaner with no effect. Because I bought the unit refurbished, RCA won't support it. The on-screen also doesn't work with a Dish DVR receiver, but that's minor. Fortunately it does still record on DVD+RW media and I can still get a 25 DVD spindle of them for under $10.00, so it's not a killer. On the bright side, I've recorded a ton of movies from the satellite and even in Normal Mode(4hr) it blows away VHS. Mostly I record in either 2hr or 3hr depending on the length of the movie. I can live with the fan noise. Also I only paid $128 for it and have gotten my money's worth out of it already. If anyone knows how to get this player to record in DVD+R mode again, I'd love to hear from you. It's because of this problem that I have to knock this rating down to a 2 stars."
1,"Review of ""How Companies Lie""","This book examines the problem of financial misstatements with a special focus on Enron. The book is light on facts and analysis, but heavy on opinion. Most of the chapters just restate contemporary criticisms of contemporary management decision-making (e.g., greed). The authors have very little to say about warning signs and the accounting used by management to mislead investors. Those wanting a more substantive analysis of the issues and the perspective of an insider should read Arthur Levitt's new book, ""Take on the Street."""
2,better ones out there,"If you read the yoga sutras, you're better off no matter what translation or additional commentary you get. That said, I didn't feel like the translation and commentary were helpful for me...I would recommend Swami Satchidananda's translation over this one. Happy reading!"
5,One of the best books on Yoga Sutra,"I can only recommend this book for anyone seriously interested in studding yoga sutra. Translation is straightforward without misleads and pseudo-simplifications. Absent are misinterpretations resulting from attempt to cram Yoga Sutras in authors own ideas. Some accentuation of particular meaning as in case of vikalpa and vitarka is present only to achieve better differentiation and clarity from modern view. Also unique is the insight in relation between basic yoga concepts and early buddism, which coexisted long centuries. Without that any attempt to understand concepts of Yoga sutra will be doomed to futility.Sanskrit text, glossary and alphabetical index of all terms used in Yoga Sutra is one of it's kind.Don't forget to download your Sanskrit-English text as addition to this book."
3,A consistent translation,"If I may clear up any confusion...translations of ancient Indian languages (Sanskrit and Pali) are works in progress. It's my understanding that there is no direct translation of Sanskrit or Pali. I have seen citta translated as mind, consciousness, of the heart, and as thought. It largely depends on the context of the entire passage and whether or not there is consistency throughout the text. This is why it is important to have a translator who possesses transcendental knowledge into what he or she is translating.Here, the translator uses consciousness for citta which is the mind in general. One could use mind if one feels more comfortable...consciousness and mind are synonyms."
1,Dry and difficult to read,"This was my first time reading The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, and I struggled with it for weeks and finished it only with great effort. The writing was dry, confusing, and I was often pausing to look up words (both English and Sanskrit). I would only recommend this book if you are a scholar interested in reading every translation of the Yoga Sutras, or if you are a devoted friend of the author. I bought this book as a required text for a class. It turns out the writer (translator) is a friend of the teacher who assigned our reading list. What a disappointment! After looking at more translations, I prefer the translation by Sri Swami Satchidananda."
2,milk of magnesia calcium,"first of all I was not happy about the free shipping I did not get that the ad promised. When I wrote to Amazon, they told me to ask the company, the company told me it was an Amazon policy, so I just got stuck with the shipping, so beware. The product tastes kinda like milk of magnesia but i take it anyway. Would i get it agian? Probably not."
4,Not bad taste,"I'm glad the liquid calcium doesn't have a strong taste to it. it has a very slight orange taste, but barely noticeable. I do not get nauseous from taking calcium in this form."
3,Excellent. but the sound high,"This Cd is good. with great succes in allemand. but this CD has a little defect, sometime is impossible to play in the system the audio. this CD has code for anti pirat. The tracks are with high volume recorder that if you heared in focus you can hear the voice a little distortion.any way is one great Cd."
3,Ufta!,"A lot of second and third-rate music sung by a first-rate singer. But not even Mireille Mathieu's excellent voice can raise this clinker above three stars. There are two or three songs on here that are worth keeping, but the rest are dreck. I've seen this cd go for a couple of bucks on Ebay, and in my estimation, there's a good reason for that."
2,only one worth it,"First let me say I am not a Zombiephile or a film critic.Some were horrible! Bad acting bad lighting, makeup, camara angles and more. Others I never got too far into because I was so bored and they dragged.One movie makes what I paid worth it. ""Bled White"". It had a nice new look at zombies that made you think. It really made you care for some of the characters. Even found myslef talking to the screen."
1,"No complaints about the seller, just the movies sucked",These movies all look like they were shot with flip cams by a group of buddies one weekend after a booze-filled bender when they thought it would be a cool idea to make a zombie movie.
5,Rags The Recycled Doll,"An Amazing effort put forth by Ann Jackson. The story and pictures as well as the search and find game are as realistic as life itself.Our children are addicted to the story and love the pictures.StevenChapel Hill, N.C."
4,"lovely, wonderful and beautiful","wonderful rhyming and beautiful illistrations, my four year old sister loved it. Rags is a cute little character, I was surprized why she was alone in the first place."
5,Easy Read!,"Thoroughly enjoyable, readable, funny and serious at the same time. The concept makes sense and gives confidence that once the weight is lost, you are ready to keep it off. I like the been-there-done-that stories, makes their success all that more remarkable. The recipes are very good - not diet food but meals the whole family can enjoy."
5,streakless car wash,"I have been using No. 7 (dupont) for more than 50 Years. It is the only car wash that does not streak , gets the surface clean on both my car and fiberclass boat."
3,Number 7 car wash,I am not quite sure why they use such a large container as is was a little more than one half filled. May be the machine that filled it was out of calibration?
4,For hockey nuts,My husband is a crazy Canadian and loves anything hockey. The more fights the better!!!!!!
5,A charming cultural portrait of a fascinating land,"Traveler's Tales is the postmodern guidebook. Instead of lists of iteneraries, temple admission prices and grainy photos, the authors of this book allow the reader to imagine Nepal in all of its tantalizing fullness. The excerpts selected range on topic and style, but all present unique aspects of the Nepali experience-- rural and urban, male and female, touristic and holistic. In opening the pages you can smell the spice markets, hear the chants of priests, feel the grinding poverty, inhale the crystalline Himalayan air and allow yourself to be carried down the narrow alleys of Pokhara. After reading Traveler's Tales: Nepal, I assue you you'll immediately run to Expedia to check fares to Kathmandu."
4,"Interesting stories beyond what a guide book can offer, like a leech crawling up your nose, and how to get it out","Another in the Travelers series of travel anthologies, this time capturing the experience of Nepal in 38 stories organized into five sections: Essence of Nepal, Some Things to Do, Going Your Own Way, In the Shadows, and The Last Word.My favourite stories are: A Nosy Neighbour by Broughton Coburn about a leech who had crawled up his nose, and how to get it out; The Art Of Walking by Jack Bennett about how to trek; Jewel Of The Nagas by Ian Baker about trying to buy a sacred jewel; The Call Of Kala Patthar by Jimmy Carter about his trek in the Solu-Khumbu; Democracy Day by Alison Wright about how the 1990 revolution in Kathmandu became deadly dangerous; Avalanche by Brian Weirum about being trapped on Mount Meru in the 1995 deadly snowstorm.I am a fan of the Travelers Tales series and find that they provide more memorable ideas about a place than just reading a guide book."
4,Awesome film,This season 1 set was every bit as fubby as it's season 2 alternate story line. I'm glad I got it.
2,Bad.,"Ok I'm sorry but the anime for Negima is really bad. Poor quality, doesn't stick to the story line, and the worst ending ever leave much to be desired. Now this is kinda upsetting coming from Xebec who also did the animation for Love Hina. Akamatsu was even disgusted with the anime and how it turned out. I would not reccomend buying this anime but instead buying and reading the manga which is a whole lot better."
4,relly great,this was a used product listed as like new product but the outer box was damged alot it should of been listed as good.
4,Another Useless Re-Release!!!!,"I seriously wanted to give this 1 star. I just purchased this box set and the week it arrives this new Negima Viridian Box set appears on AMZ. This is the exact same box set as the 1st release. Only this one comes in a smaller box and probably maybe paper packaged like the other viridian releases with no individual plastic cases. I actually purchased mine on AMZ cheaper then this 2nd box set price. I dont see the purpose of these multiple box set releases unless there's a huge price difference. Knowing anime fans people will just run out to purchase this thinking its season 2 or something. Overall this is a cute series, nothing groundbreaking. Its like Harry Potter going to school of wizardy but with girls."
1,Bad Idea for the cheaper mind,"I find this second boxed set of the series a complete waste of money and cheaply made. I myself hate slim cases and when they combine episodes packed onto one disc. I like when there is more discs to a set and when the box has more features to it.The first release of this boxed set you can still find dollars cheaper on ebay along with the special features on the discs, unlike this horrible second release of the series.People think it's cheaper, but you aren't really the kind of people who care to save money and look around for good deals.I wouldn't even give this set a negative star...but I have to at least give it one since this site makes you do it!!!"
4,Blast my eyes!,"This is a pretty great story for kids who are fascinated by pirates. The hero and his crew are all children, and their battle against piracy and plunder is noble. My five-year-old son has most of it memorized: ""Blast my eyes!"", ""Blow those babies back to kindergarten!"", ""Who's for a fight?"" And the talking parrot makes him collapse in giggles, along with the gristly sausage hanging out of Captain Thatch's mouth.The story does feel as if it's condensed from a larger source, even though it's so transparently a pastiche of Robin Hood, Peter Pan, etc. that the larger source could only be the entire genre of childhood adventure. However, it seems like it should have been about twice as long as it is--to an adult's eyes it feels rushed and hazy on some of the details. But very possibly that's part of what kids will like, as it gives their imagination some room to breathe."
4,Ignore BluesDuke`s scathing review !,"This guy BluesDuke speaks well but I`m not convinced he has the qualifications to be overly critical of Frank Marino or any other artist.Frank is much more talented than BluesDuke gives him credit for.So again I say disregard BluesDukes review completely! Let BluesDuke strum his 3 chords on an old silvertone with his big beer belly hangin out,we will listen to Frank Marino!"
5,Keep On Jumpin...,"After years (and years and years...), I finally pulled the trigger and bought this CD (used was all I could find)! I have to admit, this is a great Dance/Disco CD. Bright, upbeat and very enjoyable. I really would have worn this disc out (back in 1978) when this first came out. The most popular song was ""In the Bush"" (of course), but I don't remember ""Keep on Jumpin'"" (not at all!) Well, I've been missing out on a great song! The extra mixes are a bonus - a lot of music for your money!I rate this disc: 5 stars!"
3,Assumptions and Presentation Count,"An interesting presentation. Unfortunately, for me, the author's acceptance and presentation sour the overall power of his text. That there was institutional racism I do not argue, but that the Unions and communist/marxist groups were portrayed as 'supporting' the black causes without criticism or context leaves me less comfortable. Oakland is home and includes the majority of the period of the book. Recommended for reading, but with a fore-warning on perspective."
3,Worth Watching..but that's about it.,"The material in the video is very well presented, and Mr. Penland explains the movements and techniques very thouroughly and clearly. The form is repeated over and over from multiple angles, and the way the video was produced makes it very easy to learn the movements of the form. However, I am personally not impressed with the material presented, and don't believe that all the fuss over the years about the Matsumura Hakutsuru was worth it."
4,silver earrings,These were very pretty and a terrific value for your money I should have puchased more for gifts.
5,pretty snowflakes,For the price I paid they were worth it. Pretty little snow flakes! Gave them to several people and they loved them!
5,you must read this book,"Anyone with an interest in the history of philosophy should read this book. It is ideal for an introductory level class, but any scholar in the field should also be aware of her insights."
4,Very Trendy,When they made True Star For women i bought it for my sister and i smelt it and i was blown away and i always said i hope they make a mens version of this and they did. I am very happy with this purchase. It smells like a evergreen tree mixed with vailla with a young bachelor smell. It also is very clean smelling and not strong at all. The only reason it doest get 5 stars from me is because of 2 reasons the first is that the loser Enrique Inglesias is on the cover and the other reason is that the cologne dosent stay on for more than like 4 hours. But overall a great buy.=)
2,Buy the Canon if Low Light is your Need,I bought this item and tested in low light against an old 8mm camcorder. It was terrible. I returned this and purchased the Canon Elura 70 (older version of the elura 90). The Canon is much better - no comparison.
3,A disappointment,"Good price, and lots of features... but disappointing video quality. Yes, it has USB transfer to PC, but taking that approach (instead of DV/1394/Firewire) is clunky. The door covering the USB/Firewire connection is attached with a flimsy rubber band that surely won't last over time.The included video transfer & editing software is *terrible*.User manual is barely comprehensible -- poor content, poorly edited English. Support (updated drivers, software, etc.) on the Panasonic web site is nonexistent."
2,Descent But didn't work properly,"Hey there! The camera is great; however, after taking it on a trip with me all my video turned out badly because there appears to be a problem with the head. I won't totally blame this on the seller, but will say that it was quite dissapointing to have a bad camera immediately after purchasing what I thought was a totally refurbed unit."
5,Too great for words!!!,"I was a little worried about purchasing this camera, the reviews on all the sites i checked were all 5 stars (nothing below that) but i'd never used anything other than cannon and minolta. I wont say I know everything about camcorders/cameras but I know enough to know a good one compared to a bad one, and this is a GREAT camcorder/camera. I have only had it about 2 1/2 to 3 weeks, but I've so much videos that turned out crisp and clear, with great sound. I love the light for low light shots, although I dont take many in the dark, it's still a nice feature. I love that you can take video as well as use a memory card to take photos, thats a great option. I Highly recommend this camcorder/camera to anyone who wants a great zoom, with great features....you'll love this camera, I know I do!!!"
5,Great Camera so far.....,"Just bought this camcorder a few days ago and so far, I've been very impressed. The low-light capabilities appear very adequate. The ease of transfer to the PC via the DV-Firewire link is excellent. Haven't had a chance to check out many features yet, but easy of use for picking up the camera and shooting a video is great. So far, I think I've made a good choice."
2,Not that good...,"Great camera? When indoors this thing is sub-par. If there are worse camcorders than this, why are they selling? Three 60 watt lights, a Christmas tree and a 45 watt recessed light, and this thing is grainy and dark. it was hard to make out facial features let alone the subject's eyes. I tried all the settings to no avail (on a positive note all the settings, including manual, are easy to use). Another gripe is the image stabilization. It creates an odd effect, kind of a a slightly noticeable fuzzy filter. How can people call this thing great? It's really not."
5,"A voice of majesty, mystery, and alienated passion","Among the great lions of melancholy music Leonard Cohen, Nick Drake and Ian Curtis are all great. In many ways, however, Scott Walker surpasses them all. His is the great, lost voice of the century."
2,"NOT USA made, too bad",Having used S-K tools for years I'm sorry to say the new sets don't come close to what I'vecome to expect. This same wrench is branded under many different names but with the S-Kname you'll pay top dollar. Look on e-bay and you'll see the same wrench set for half the price.Don't get me wrong China can make a quality wrench but it'll NEVER come close to my good oldUSA made S-K wrenches. Craftsman is a better choice for the same money and still made in theUSA.
4,simply but useful,very nice was to keep from stick hot seats in the summer or to keep the lads with jeans of off your valour car sets!!Loose woven so the air circulates keep the seat and you both cool. Great for the summer heat.
5,A piece of science fiction history,"According toTime Machines: The Story of the Science-Fiction Pulp Magazines from the Beginning to 1950, ""The first paperback anthology of sf was The Pocket Book of Science-Fiction, edited by Donald Wollheim for Pocket Books in 1943. Wollheim ranged far and wide in his selection of material, and included one story from each of Wonder Stories and Amazing and three from Astounding.""So to my mind, this is a must-have for any fan or student of early SF. Ten nifty little stories by Stephen Vincent Benet, Ambrose Bierce, John Collier, H.G Wells, T.S. Stribling, Wallace G. West, Stanley G. Weinbaum (his classic ""Martian Odyssey""), Don A. Stuart (""Twilight""), Theodore Sturgeon (""Microcosmic God"") and Robert Heinlein (""-And He Built a Crooked House"")."
3,"Jimmy Page - 'Session Man,Volume 2' (Voxx/Bomp) 3 1/2 stars","The average Jimmy Page/Zeppelin fan would probably get a decent amount of enjoyment from this compilation CD.Twenty-one cuts of Page's pre-Zep studio session works between 1963-65.I heard in an interview that Page was once available as an around-the-clock studio musician in which many times he stood in for another performer/artist that he never got proper credit for.Good collection of assorted cuts from many different sort of British Invasion and Freakbeat personel.Some of the tracks I remembered being nice to have handy were ex-T.Rex drummer Mickey Finn(R.I.P.)""This Sporting Life"",The Primitive's ""You Said"",pajama scarlet Brenda Lee&Page with ""Is It True"" and the two Yardbirds cuts in their early version,""Train Kept A Rollin'"" and ""White Summer"".Nice."
4,better than admin I (OCA) book,"i have passed my ocp 10g exam last month, thanks to this book and bersinic & watson book (ocp all in one exam guide). i have to say overall this book is better than the admin I book also by sybex. the thing i like about this book is it covers more than the exam needs, e.g. how to create the rman recovery catalog, which is not found in other ocp preparation materials (including oracle's student guide for admin II training). i also find the flashcards helpful (also available in sybex oca), and the two bonus exams. but just be very careful when assessing the answers to all the questions, there is a few misleading answers i found, although it is very rare. the best way to find the right answer is to test the question on a practice database, or find the exact answer from Oracle's documentation. i would still say it is a good and pretty complete reference for your OCP 10g exam."
3,Proof-reading needed,"This book apparently underwent no proof-reading. Careless and obvious mistakes abound. The publisher's errata page is of little use although the book has been published for nearly two years. Considering that this is a book you rely on to pass an exam, this is close to irresponsible.I've only read half of the book, I hope the remaining is better."
2,Not enough to pass the test,"This book is jam-packed with info that the Oracle 10g DBA will need to know...unfortunately, its not enough to pass the exam. The book isn't necessarily at fault - the exam is full of so many trick questions and obscure references that cooincidentally are all spelled out in Oracle's training material (which you'll need to shell out three thousand dollars to attend the class and get the books).In order to get OCP certified, you have to attend an Oracle class anyway, so skip this book and get the training from the source."
2,Plenty of errors,"This book seems to be pretty much a rehash of the PHP manual complete with the same errors and omissions that the PHP manual has. As a desktop reference for PHP, it may be useful for the casual PHP user as it contains information on installation and configuration but for more serious programmers, stick with the online manual or see the 'PHP Functions Essential Reference' in print soon."
1,Tae Kwon Do is not Karate,Also there is no such thing as American Bo or American Nunchaku. This is clearly a misrepresentation to make money. Do yourself a favor and seek authentic videos instead of mixed up misleading ones.
1,"""Exceptional Durability""? No.","The thing looks great, and the rubber doesn't slip at all. Problem? It broke *before* I even used it. Enough said."
1,"Great idea, poor quality product","I had purchased two of these rests for my daughter - one for home and the other for the road. After five days of use - no more than 30 minutes of practice each day with a full size cello, one of them had broken. This product might be OK for occasional use with a fractional size cello, but if you are planning a lot of use with a full size instrument you might consider a more traditional end pin rest."
4,JBarnes,"This board isn't thick like a cake drum so I usually use it with a fabric covered wood board for support since the cakes are very heavy that go on this. However, it's large enough for what I need and the seller always gets it here very promptly even being located in Canada. I actually have to order another one soon."
5,Bought 2 they work!,Bought 2 of these because I use the numeric pad for cursor control. I plugged them in and they both worked fine and didn't interact with the built in numeric pad.When and if I need more I'll buy these again!
4,Worked fine with MAC,"I was concerened that this item wouldn't function properly with a mac, but had no problems. Does the job!!"
4,Decent camcorder with a few cons,"The camcorder offers outstanding video quality (at its price level)in adequate lighting condition. I had a chance to compare it to Cannon Opture 500. I think GS150 produces better color than Opeture does, due largely to 3ccd, but makes slightly more noise in low light settings.I like the joystick, which makes the control panel look clean and simple.However, there are a few things I am not happy with.1. Generally, EIS does not improve much from GS120. Without a tripod, you still need to hold your breath if you want to get really stable video.2. There is no EIS in widescreen mode.3. Again, low light performance is not satisfactory.So, if you do most of your shooting outdoor and are confident on your ""stability skills,"" this is a great camcorder to buy."
2,After one year camera began showing error messages,"The camera is very good for a year after that it just stops working showing ""Push the Reset Switch"" error message. If you google that message you will find out that almost all the results are for this kind of camera. My advice as an owner, DO NOT buy this camera."
1,"Awful Product, Awful Service, Shame on Panasonic","I have owned this item for 1 year. The camcorder has a serious focusing problem. While filming in any light condition, the image goes out of focus. The problem is widespread on ALL of the GS-150 and GS-250 units. Panasonic refuses to replace the unit, refuses to fix the item without charging 261.50 and refuses to answer phone calls to their repair center (all you get is a voicemail and they never return your call). Steer clear of PANASONIC. I will never purchase from them again. If their products were worth even a nickel then they would offer more than a 90 day warranty on a $650 camcorder. Ridiculous."
4,very nice camera,"We bought this camera Oct. 2005 and it malfunctioned two months later. We spent the next two weeks trying to contact Panasonic. Panasonic website e-mail doesn't work. Finally a local Panasonic dealer told us to contact Bigston Corp. They fixed it within the 90 day warranty. Works great since then.As far as the camera itself, very nice. Video and still picture quality in daylight are sharp with very nice colors. It's fairly easy to use with many auto and manual functions. Contrary to instructions, it seems it works as webcam on Macs (OS 10.3).A few drawbacks- the 0 lux feature captures 1 frame per second to enhance light capture making video very choppy and virtually useless for veiwing; manual focusing w/joystick can be a bit difficult; does not come with memory card, tapes or firewire cable (neccessary to download video at least on Macs).Still recommend this camera as good compromise of quality and price."
1,Useless...,"After you get past the euphoria produced by the great quality picture the gs150 produced you'll soon see the huge flaws in it's other features. The auto focus is incredibly buggy, it will jump into a blurry focus at the slightest change and will take far too long to correct itself. After it's done with it's blurry seizure you are ticked that your son's graduation is really blurry so you set it to manual focus which is controlled by it's joystick and is completely useless for keeping any moving object in focus.If you want to produce any video beyond that of small, placid, family events then do NOT buy this camera. The clarity of it's picture is overshadowed by it's inability to control it."
1,Another Vote to Avoid this Camera,"I agree with the previous reviews that my camera acquired serious focus problems after about 15 months, in every video we own you can hear me complaining about the focus. More $$$ down the tubes, worse yet, all the video of my 4th child is blurred."
3,Fed up with panasonic camcorders!,"My 1st camcorder: PV-L857. After 2 years of very light use the lens started making loud clicking noise when zoomed.My 2nd camcorder: PV-GS150. After 1.5 years of light use the camcorder started to lose focus in auto mode (with clean lens). It will focus initially, but then blur within a minute, and I have to move or zoom a little to regain focus. Low light performance is noticeably worse than my sister's old sony dcr-trv8.Bottom line: panasonic gets you with cheap options and features but your frustration with low quality will last much longer than the short thrill of saving a few bucks."
2,Hmm...,"Well, OK. This book was NOT Anne Mazer's best. Actually, it pretty much stunk. I absolutely hate the ""new"" Natalie- she was my favorite character before! Also... a crush? Abby? No way! I am almost 12 years old and have NEVER had a crush! Plus, I mean, Simon is completely weird!"
1,yuck,I love Abby Hayes. But this book is just so silly. She has this crush on a guy called Simon and that is it. Nothing else happens in this book. I am not buying any more Abby Hayes books. I am now switching to Madison Finn.
5,Super Fun Movie,I watched this when I was living in Australia and fell in love with it. I am so happy it has finally come out in the US!Be prepared to have these songs stuck in your head for days!
5,"Fun and feel good musical,","Brand New Day may not be for everyone. I love the major characters, the music, and the gorgeous scenery of Broome, Western Australia. So it may be a little on the hokey side, but it is fun and certainly you can't help but feeling good when the curtain comes down."
2,Boring,"I love musicals and I love Geoffrey Rush so this looked like a perfect movie for me! Unfortunately, it was a complete waste of time. The story was weak. More importantly, though, the music was awful. I actually hated watching this DVD. I really wish I'd rented if from Netflix first."
3,ok film.,"This film was ok but not a great film. The action lagged at times. Overall it was worth my time, but it won't be long remembered."
2,One of only two stinkers in the Sab catalog,"I am a huge Sabbath fan. I like all their work except this & Forbidden, which stands as the absolute worst! This is a close second; the title track is by far the best song on it & Nightwing is good also, but the rest is just not up to par. Try TYR or Cross Purposes for the better Tony Martin era material. The songs are just weak on this release."
1,Black Sabbath huh?,"Unless you are a solo artist, I really can't consider one original member left in a band the same band as it started as. If you look at all the Black Sabbath albums made after Born Again as a Tony Iommi solo project, then its not so bad. Some people can find beauty in anything. If you are planning on buying this, I sure hope you have their first 6 albums because this will scare you away if not. But I mean, hey, its the 80's. Most heavy metal bands sounded like this. Generic metal vocalist, you've heard it all before. If you really like those first 6 albums, do yourself a favor and save some money on this."
4,"Yeah!Heavy Metal, I would say!","This is a little different from other Sabbath albums. Many people consider Tony Martin a bad vocalist. I like him, well, at least in this one, he did a great job! Much better than Tyr and Eternal Idol."
3,Too much evil content.,"Musically this album rocks. Great drumming, riffs, and overall guitar. Tony Martin's voice doesn't sound too bad either. However, I personally see no need in lyrics that focus on witches, devils, and evil. That is just something that does not appeal to me. The music is good, but the lyrics are highly questionable. The question being what do the people who wrote them really believe in?"
4,The best non-Ozzy/Dio/Gillan/Hughes record,"Devil & Daughter, Headless Cross, When Death Calls are great songs. I think Nightwing is the opus on this album. The entire album is well-produced & written. I rank it in the Top 5 (well... Top 7) Sabbath albums of all time."
4,Visual Mnemonics for phys & anatomy,"I love all of the visual mnemonic books by Laurie Marbas. My favorites are pharm and biochm. They have made a huge difference in how I study, improved my grades by 10%, and save me many hours and anxiety!"
2,Check your part numbers!,"Check at Zero Gravity before ordering. This is not a Double Bubble windscreen.For this item, the Double Bubble is pictured, but is actually a standard replacement windscreen."
5,happy to find this tape to watch a good series for children,I am so glad to find this video. It is not easy to find this series videos. I enjoy the series as well as my children and my granddaughter.
3,EASTER EGG!!!,"Easter Egg: Shawn Michaels discusses Sherri Martel singing his theme song.How To Access: Go to the chapters section. Highlight 'Sensational Sherri.' Click the Left arrow twice. The clip will then play.IT'S AN OK DVD THOUGH, I JUST WISH IT WAS 2 DISCS AND TALKED MORE ABOUT EACH MANAGER MORE THEN JUST 5-8 MIN A PIECE, BUT FOR OLD SCHOOL FANS, iD GET IT IF IT WAS CHEAP, ITS NOT WORTH MORE THEN $20"
2,WWE Just needed to make a DVD this week.,"The managers they cover are great. As far as their reviews here, they could have done better. This DVD is almost like they didnt feel like making a DVD, but had to anyway. Not one of their better efforts."
1,Aren't we missing somebody?,"It may just be me, but aren't we missing the greatest wrestling manager of all time? How can you have a DVD and not include The Doctor of Style: SLICK. I really would have loved to have seen him on this DVD, as I feel he earned his place on it."
3,50 - 50,"I have no background in psychology and have some interests in philosophy and religions. The first part of the book where the concepts and experimental evidences of the adaptive unconscious are presented is very interesting. But the second half of the book where I was hoping to find information leading to the understanding of our hidden unconscious mind, is disappointing. I guess for now the western science still has no sure way to lead us there."
4,A good enlightening read,Presents some interesting ways of looking at our ways of thinking. Complete with reviews of the scientific literature.Very good ideas and particularly interesting scientific studies behind the ideas.The thorough nature of the book makes its message a bit redundant and drawn out. Still recommended though.
5,A wild and fun ride through your mind,"Combining a variety of studies and experiments, Timothy Wilson has written a fun, challenging, and intelligent book about the connections between our unconscious and our conscious minds. Avoiding old dualisms, showing why Freudian psycholanalysis is a dead-end, Wilson shows how little we understand ourselves, and what we can do to gain more knowledge.Wilson writes engaging prose, with no jargon; but he presents ideas that intrigueing and exciting. Using many studies and experiments, this book makes the reader think about why we do what we do: the answers are not always comforting, but always important.This is a terrific book."
3,A good overview for non-specialists,"I think this is a very good book for the 'educated layman' as they say, and that's clearly who the author had in mind. I think he did a great job of making this material accessible to a broader audience, though I was hoping for something a little less introductory in nature. If you're curious about psychology, the unconscious, and what 'makes us tick', I think you'll like this book."
1,no one should by a $19 bow!,No one should be buying a $19 bow. How would you like to make a bow for $19? Not possible right? You get what you pay for. And the best way to buy a bow is go to a legitimate dealer and play the bow!
1,The Cajun rages no more!,"I was looking for some vintage Doug Kershaw when I ran across this fairly recent live album. I was severely dissapointed. I was hoping to hear some of the flamboyent fiddlin' of old but heard hardy any at all. The songs are medicocre and the arrangments are boring at best. The songs came across like demos. The only fiddle music on here is minor background playing, except a little intro on song #2. There is hardly any lead instrumentation at all. Thirty years ago I heard Kershaw play Orange Blossom Special at the speed of light at the Troubadour. I listened to this CD once and threw it out equally as fast."
4,Great Find!,I did a lot of research and this was the best home theater receiver for the money. It has lots of capabilites normally seen in recievers costing twice as much. I particularly like the ability to up convert video inputs from my VCR and older model DVD player. One thing that I didn't like was the manual. It was very confusing and didn't seem to flow in a logical manner.
2,Lack of Volume,"So I did figured out it needs the optical cable for the sound and able to reassigned the sound source to make everything work. But I'm now a little dissapointed with the sound output. I have to crank the volume up to 50+ (65 is max) to have any kind of loudness for a good movie or NFL game. Even though the volume is at 50, I can set my TV (Samsung S6187) volume to be 20 and it sound louder than the Bose Accousticmass 10 center speaker that I have right over the top of the TV. I'm not quite sure if I did anything wrong. But i'm going to take this one back to and try out something else to see if it's any better. If anybody else have this receiver, please let me know the volume level you set to get the loudness you want."
1,Very Disappointing,"I had great expectations when purchasing this receiver, based on it's 700 watts of power for each speaker. After connecting and powering up, I had to turn the volume way up to drive the speakers. I expected a very powerful sound with this kind of power, not what I was experiencing. It was almost as if there was something keeping the power from driving the speakers. I had a 200 watt stereo hooked up before this, and it did a better job. Perhaps I had a faulty unit, but it was returned yesterday and I am not one to return items."
2,save your money,"This is one of Sony's disasters. They design and market an HDMI amp where the HDMI doesn't function. You can't have surround sound thru the HDMI connections. You would have to run component cables to achieve this. So what's the point with the HDMI??? A joke. The speaker connects are very poorly designed too. You have to clamp down hard to secure the wires, hoping the plastic knob doesn't brake in the process. Go with Denon or JVC if you're thinking HDMI."
2,HDMI switching problems,"Like many posting here, I bought the receiver as a low-cost solution for HDMI switching. I have a Westinhouse LCD HDTV connected to a Oppo upconverting DVD player and Motorola HD cable box, and wanted to be able to switch between them.I've struggled to get the HDMI switching to work. The Oppo (with a DVI output plus separate audio out) works beautifully, but the Moto box won't switch. I've spent several hours isolating the problem to the receiver hdmi switch, and am close to giving up.Potential buyers should do their research -- make sure Sony will work with your HDMI sources before you buy. And if anyone has an answer to my problem - let me know!Update: I returned the receiver after discovering their is an acknowledged problem switching some HDMI sources, notably Motorola cable boxes. This problem is not unique to Sony, I'm told."
5,Sony STR-DG800 7.1-Channel,After reading reviews I found this receiver to be a good buy considering what it has for $250. One reviewer posted a neat trick to get digital audio - you assign one of the inputs ( optical video in this case ) to a device ( DVD ). This allowed me to use the HDMI cable passthrough for video and the optical audio output from my Oppo DVD player for sound. This is a nice low end sony product.
5,Sony STR-DG800 Receiver,"The receiver was fairly easy to hookup. I connected 2 DVD players, a VCR without any issues. The automatic setup for sound was easy to follow, and I made very little adjustments to the final setup."
5,Home Theater,"I am extremely satisfied with the product, qaulity and delivery time of this purchase. I found the best price, far lower than the best retailer and the delivery time was only a few days."
4,STR-DG800 7.1 Receiver,"This receiver works great, I would have given it a 5 rating except for the following disapointment. The specs said it has ""ON-Screen"" display, this is only true of passing thru the displays from attached componets, it does not display information about the receiver settings like the info on the receiver display, volumn level, etc."
1,extremely disappointed,"I am completely disappointed with this receiver. The HDMI pass through would be a great feature if it actually worked properly. The problem I am having is that it allows feedback between the two devices linked through the receiver. So far it has damaged the HDMI port on two DVD up converters. I am traditionally a Sony guy, but not in this case. Spend your money elsewhere it would be a wiser investment."
1,Sony HDMI,"I purchased this receiver at Best Buy 3 days ago. It's going back tomorrow. I just can't forgive Sony for the lack of HDMI audio support. Sure I can use HDMI for video, optical for audio, and reassign an optical port... But I wont! Don't be duped by Sony, stay away from their receivers. I can only imagine how many man hours have been waisted figuring out this undocumented limitation. The HDMI ports do not belong ont this receiver."
5,Great AV amp with 2 HDMI inputs and 1 out to HD TV,"This unit makes it easy to hook up your HD DVD and HD DirectTV box to your new HD TV with the use of the HDMI cable to attain the best possible connection between them. The sound is just passed through and you can still feed a digital audio out from the TV or DVD player to the amp for sound. A super reasonable HDMI solution with plenty of power for a 5.1 surround speaker system like the Klipsh Quintet III ( with matching 10 or 12 in. powered SUB) Are their better units out there--sure, but not for under $500 or $600. This unit is the best value for what it does."
4,I think it's GREAT!,"First off, to call a brand-new product, just released, ""junk"" is just not right. I just got this unit the other day to replace my older Sony AV as I wanted the HDMI for my DVD and the XM option. I had no problems whatsoever with setup or operation. Speaker calibration was flawless, as was the whole setup. One must READ the MANUAL, work carefully, and there usually won't be problems. The only downside is that my Sony VCR won't operate on a HDMI upgrade through the unit but as soon as the new Sony DVD/VCR is released in July I'll be fine. Sure, one could shell out over a grand for a fancier system, but for the money it's fine."
5,WHAT A STEAL !,"5 stars for the price of the package! 2 or 3 stars for each movie! These zombie films are not the best zombie films ever made,but for the price you can't go wrong here. When all is said & done you end up paying about $6.50 a movie! Thats a deal & a half for 4 hours of harmless stupid gorey fun."
2,The Price is Right... the Movies? Terrible!,"Now I love zombie movies and Zombie and Zombie 2 (which believe it or not are the same movie) were good but 3, 4, and 5 are terrible! Bad dubbing and terrible script! If these are sequels, how come they don't follow what happened in the first movie? There's so many plot holes as well, especially in Zombie 3 and 4 and for some reason the ""heroes"" in the movies keep finding random stashes of M16A1 assault rifles in the oddest places such as hotels and hospitals. Nothing makes sense in 3, 4, and 5. I reccomend not buying this, I mean the price is good but the movies are terrible... I heard some of the dumbest quotes ever taken from a movie in some of these films... for example from Zombie 3; ""Man this Blue Heart (local DJ) has some great music!"" - Soldier 1 ""Yeah! This music is making me horny!"" - Soldier 2 Wow... Great script writing there!"
2,"ok for the price, but i wish i would have never bought it","maybe i just don't like horror movies not made in the united states, i did like dead alive, undead and some of foreign horror films i've seen, but this movie pack even for 5 bucks a movie is just not worth the time, the movies were ok but i really did not enjoy watching any of them, hopefully the second zombie pack i got will be better, for this one failed to entertain me hardly at all, just not enough bite for me............"
5,Westlake Is The Master Of The Hustle,"Not only is this the book by which I judge every other comic crime novel I read, it is my favorite book, period. Westlake's writing is timeless in its humor, yet simultaneously, he manages to capture a snapshot of the culture about which he writes. A running theme of this novel is 'The Hustle,' the dance craze from the period in the 1970s in which it was written, as well as the more perfidious sort of hustle - a scam to smuggle one valuable artifact out of its native country in the midst of a box of fakes, and what happens when that scam goes wrong. Thick with a riot of vivid characters, I laugh and shake my head in disbelief every time I turn the page in this story. It is an amazing piece of work, and a brilliant testament to Donald E. Westlake's wit and craftiness."
3,Not always accurate,"A very fine book, however wrong mark is shown for Old Newbury Crafters. O.N.C. neveruses a ""bird"" mark on their sterling. The mark is that of Meriden Silver. Other informationhopefully is more accurate."
2,encyclopeda of american silver manufactures,"There are some aspects of this book that provide some useful information, but overall it is quite inadequate for detailed search. There are other books that are better."
5,More excellent poetic chaos with a frenzed beat.,"This one is much like the first. Fun to listen to and very creative and inovative. Pure Folk coffee house Poetry with Rock & Roll thrown in. Killer CD. As with the first CD, this is not for all ears but I do like it and do recommend it. Just crank it up and experience that coffee house folk/rock poetry feel."
4,Second record plus more,"This was the second LP released by the FUGS. I purchased it recently. It includes extra mateial not on the ESP lp release. My only dismay in buying this, is because the complete CD is also on the box set ""Don't Stop"". Had I known this, I would have just purchased the box set. I gave my copy of this to a friend, since it was the same material. If you plan on buying the box set, you will not need this, because it is all in the box set. If you are not going to buy the set, and would like to hear some Fugs classics, like Kill for Peace, Morning Morning, or ""Doin' All Right""(my favorite) then get it."
3,A Political Look into the Soviet/Afganistan War,"Harry Bradsher's book ""Afgan Communism and Soviet Intervention"" is a good book about the political situation in Afghanistan during the late 1970s and 1980s. It covers in great detail the governmental situation and changes that drove Afghanistan and the Soviet Union into armed conflict.What I which was included in this book was more information about the combat actions between the warring factions.So if your looking for a book about the political situation, then this is it. If your looking for a book on the military operations of the Soviet-Afghanistan War, then you might want to look somewhere else."
4,"Great sound, even better value.","These speakers are easily the best set of speakers I have ever seen for the price. Forget spending $300-400 on floor speakers that might not sound as good as these simply because they have a brand name on them. The second set of sub woofers in the sides of these speakers actually are loud enough so that I had to turn down the gain on my separate woofer that came with my surround sound. These are perfect if you want to get a little more out of your surround sound if you don't want to spend loads of cash. They look great out of the box, too."
4,Nice for the price,"Not SnapOn quality, but also not $200. Meets expectations at price. The torque readings seem to be accurate. Product fits in case nicely. 25"" long - likely not appropriate for smaller, lower torque jobs, such as brake caliper slide pins. Great for hub nuts and the like."
1,Barely lasted a year...,It barely lasted a year. Worked ok for a while but finally stopped. It's a nice tire bumper now. Auto*Zone has a lifetime warranty...
3,Good Wrench Only One Complaint,"This seems to be a good quality wrench; it hasn't broken yet with just about weekly use. The thing that I don't like about it is the locking mechanism for the torque setting. It is a knurled nut on the end, which sometimes comes loose during use which will affect torque settings. That's the reason for the three-star rating, since obviously a precise setting is important when tightening crucial parts."
4,Decent for the money,"As I am a shade tree mechanic with only rare need for a torque wrench, when I needed to replace my ancient beam-type wrench, I did not want to spend $200+ for a new one. This Mountain brand wrench (made in China) illustrates the case that, as with most tools, you tend to get what you pay for. This torque wrench looks fine (decent quality), is quite hefty, comes with a slip certifying it is within spec., and seems to work well. However, the scale is quite hard for me to read, especially in shade, and the steel and tooling appears less than first rate. Overall, a decent deal for the money you pay for this."
3,OK for the money but no Counter-Clockwise torque,Good:-Inexpensive-Long handleBad:-Heavy-Not Dual Direction. It only clicks when tightening Clockwise. Tightening on Counter-Clockwise applications does not click.If you are going to work on right-hand threads only this tool will work just fine. The long handle provides enough leverage for high torque requirements.If you are going to work on left-hand threads then this tool will not help. It will only serve you as a breaker bar. Other than that it seems decent for the low price.I did not keep mine... returned it and looking for another wrench that can do both directions.
4,Awesome tool,Hubby had been shopping for a torque wrench and was happy to order this one.It is a tool that is not used often at our home but when it's needed... he has it!Great quality for the price!
5,Very nice! Works as expected!,"No complaints, it's heavy-duty, nice build-quality, and does the job right with an audible 'CLICK!'Very nice for the price! A must have for any shade tree mechanic."
5,Great Torque Wrench,Great wrench for a good price. Matco wanted $300 for one like it. Other A & P's in my show were amazed at the price. I will write later and tell you if it is durable. It is certified and that is the one piece of information I am required to have to be able to use it.
5,Mountain torque wrench,"I received the Torque wrench over night, which I did not expect. Delivered by FedEx.I torqued the lugs on travel trailer. Love the two foot length. Setting the force took a minute to be correct on the torque but it worked beautifully.I am very happy. I do not need a torque wrench every day so the price was fair and the quality perfect for my needs."
5,is it weird to be in love with a torque wrench?,"what can i say? very simple to use, long enough to give the leverage needed for high-torque tightening, and the 'audible click' is very audible and extremely satisfying."
5,Awesome Tool,"The handle was longer than I expected and that is a good thing when torquing higher values, works great on Lug Nuts and will prevent you from warping your rotors when using correct values for your vehicle. A good Torque Wrench used correctly is the difference between a Shade Tree Mechanic and a Tech. Which would you rather have working on your car? The wrench is of extremely good quality and comes in it's own case. If I had to do it all over again I would buy this again without any regrets."
5,Great Wrench,"This is a very good tool for the money. I'm not sure what more you could expect. I like the analog dial way the desired torque is set. I feel it is superior, and have a long life."
2,"Worked great, then came apart","This was a great wrench for six months of use. Really solid and easy to use. So, I took good care of it. Loosened after each use, and stored it in the box. I guess the ride in my Expedition was too rough for it, as the adjustable bottom came loose and it now is completely unadjustable. Useless. Sending it back today to see if Mountain will repair or replace under warranty. For the money, a good product, except for the fact that it broke with minimal use (perhaps I torqued all 4 wheels X 5 bolts 30 times)."
4,MOTOWN MUSIC.......,RELAXING ENJOYING LISTENING TO GREAT MUSIC OF YESTERDAY. FAVORITE TUNES OF THAT TIME SEEING THE GROUPS AND SOLO PERFORMERS BRINGING MOTOWN SIZZLE . GREAT TO HAVE AND WATCH BESIDES LISTENING IS AWESOME.........
3,Excellent quality illustrations,"This book contains 88 illustrations, 51 of which are full-color. The book is 127 pages (to give you an idea of art-to-script ratio). After a 20-page essay (with historical photographs) on the Pre-Raphaelites, a selection of their works follows. Every other page is a full-page color print.I only gave the book 3 stars because it is cheaply bound and I would have preferred to see a slightly different selection of paintings. That being said, I am happy to have bought the book and would do so again."
3,Clearly written for work place situations,"Almost every situation in this book relates to how to handle people in the work place. And more pointedly for managers handling employees. Most of the advice given would not work in your private life. For example I know someone who is so eager to please that he will agree to do any favor someone askes of him, even if he can't deliver. The tip for this is to ""ask them to let you have confirmation in writing of exactly how they'll be doing what you've asked."" This may work with an difficult employee but I wouldn't be comfortable asking a friend, who has just agreed to do me a favor, to put it in writing. There were some good solutions but many of them I found to be superficial, manipulating and even condescending.Unless you manage employees you will not find much practical advice here. I read this on the Kindle Fire and it was formatted well and well written."
1,Not good. No specific ways to handle real problems with difficult people.,Written from a managers perspective. As vague and loftyas a presidential debate. Wasted time and money hoping it would get into examples of how to deal with difficult coworkers in my workplace.
1,nah,"nah.... can't do this with folks.... this doesn't work...I find I can talk to anyone anytime in my life and not make a project out of it. If they want to talk to me fine, if not fine too.Manipulating people to ones own satisfaction...... hello!The problem with this book is control.I just turned my rating from a 2 to 1."
5,Great Book!,This book sure helped me deal with the difficult people in my life. Highly recommend it!
2,You get what you pay for...,"Chocked full of common sense, but no real insights. I find it hard to believe this would help anyone unless they have been living on a deserted island their entire life. There are no real insights to the human psychi here, just every-day truisms that most should have picked up in life already."
2,Absolutely useless,Nothing new provided. Any reader should be well aware of the types of people described the author describes in this book.
5,A good book for prople who hsve to deal with lots of personalities dvery day,This describes most of the difficult people you will run across in business dealings snx has some very useful tips to defuse their attitudes!
2,Unclear Analysis & Suggestions,"In general, I find that this book doesn't explore in depth for each type of difficult people. It would be more helpful if there is more thorough description on how to handle them. To me as a reader, I had this impression that the book only intended to define each category of the difficult people, and then moved on just with one or two mentions on the handling how-to. I finished reading the book without getting much of it other than the realization of how many kinds of difficult people we may ever encounter in life."
3,avid reader,interesting and insightful but a little too long winded in getting to the point. I found myself skipping over parts and skimming a good bit to finally get to the point.
2,Title is misleading...,"The book didn't rock my world. And it honestly wasn't what I expected. I thought it would give examples of how to deal with different personality types. What I got was how to deal with different personality types in the WORKPLACE. Let's face it, we may spend a ton of time at work. Learning to deal with different personalities in that setting is useful. But our most complex relationships are outside of the workplace, amongst our family and friends. If the author intended the book to be about workplace conflict and how to resolve it, it's okay. As a guide for truly dealing with all of the different personality types in our lives, it misses the mark."
3,I did not read this book,I didn't read this book and deleted it from my Kindle. It is one of those books I thought would be a good learning tool but later decided I did not want to read.
3,No go for hypo allergenic wearer,"When I first recieved this navel ring I really enjoyed wearing it. It was nice and sparkely and very cute being a top mount. However, after a month, the shiny metal coating began to wear off and the copper core was revealed. As an individual who has difficulty with nickel and copper jewelry it began to irratate my navel and I can no longer wear it. It is an adorable ring; however, if you want something that lasts or have cheap metal allergies I would not recomend buying it."
3,Not One of the Best,"Writer/mother/detective Lucy Stone is busy working on interesting news stories, when one falls right into her lap. The death of Metinnicut Indian activist, Curt Nolan. Murdered with a war club. At least that's what was found in his head. Soon Lucy is investigating what seems like thousands of suspects, whom all had something against Curt, a person who seemed to make enemies wherever he went. While it seems easy enough to add a little investigating to her list of chores, it's not as easy as Lucy thinks. Especially since she could be the next to die.I enjoyed the Lucy Stone Christmas mysteries. But this one just didn't do it for me. I feel that the novel was slow-moving, and at times, downright boring. I hope that my next Lucy Stone mystery is better than this one."
4,This book is no turkey,"Lucy Stone has alot on her plate these days. Not only does she have to prepare a Thanksgiving feast for family and quests, butshe has to meet a deadline at the Pennysaver and now she finds a dead body.The body in question belongs to Curt Nolan the one Metinnicut Indian who opposed building a gambling casino in Tinker Cove. Who had the most to gain by killing the outspoken Nolan? This is the question that Lucy wants answers to.This is the fourth Lucy Stone novel that I have read and in my opinion they keep getting better and better. In all of Ms. Meier's novel there is something that we can all relate too. That you Ms. Meier and keep them coming."
1,I should have listened,"I just finished this book, the latest in a series all of which I have read and enjoyed. I read the review from the New England reader before buying, but since all the series titles were enjoyable, I bought and read anyway. I have to agree that this was by far the worst in the series. Lucy did not read as the same person as in the others. The mystery was hidden beneath a very cozy description of the real life of a working mother. Although it is very accurate, it does not make for a good mystery. I did not get to know any of the characters well enough to have the least idea what the outcome would be. It became an effort to remain interested, though the book was a quick read (perhaps because it lacked substance). I recommend you skip this title and try others in the series."
2,Poorly printed book- GREAT Seller,"Ink for print is very light and thus too difficult to read. Margins are strange- printing began at very top of page, but left about 3"" margin at the bottom throughout book. I am 60 and had trouble with it. Gave it away. Got input from someone with younger eyes and they had the same difficulty. Seller was great and will buy from again."
3,Boring Thanksgiving,"I am being very generous in giving this book 3 stars. The mystery wasn't that great or interesting. Character development wasn't done very well. The boring city council meetings that the reader had to ""sit through"" were horrible. The boring football games that the reader had to ""watch"" every move were the boringest games ever. Toby and Elizabeth are unappreciative brats. This book was a chore to get interested in. I am very interested in History and American Indians, but the way this book presented them was very boring indeed. The atmosphere, except for a few minor spots, was not cozy. I did like the scenes with TomTom Turkey. And I did like when snow or frost was mentioned.I was hoping this was going to be a warm, wonderful Thanksgiving mystery, especially since this is the season. But who has an appetite for Thanksgiving dinner when the Turkey falls on the floor?For a much better, cozy, charming Thanksgiving mystery, Kate Borden's ""Death of a Turkey"" is it."
2,The Dough Didn't Rise,"TURKEY DAY MURDER by Leslie Meier is a disappointment to a legion of fans of Lucy Stone. Scenes about family life work better than the mystery and murder that needs to be solved. Reads more like well here's a holiday I have included, but it doesn't work.Nash Black, author of QUALIFYING LAPS."
5,Best pans I've ever used.,"I bought these pans for camping, but they would be in the house were it not for the vintage Guardian Ware. Absolutely the most even heat and clean up is a snap. I told my husband I could justify the price by the savings in propane use. My camp stove keeps going out because I turn it down so low. When it's time to come home :-( they all nest together and fit in less than 12"" of space."
4,If you like compilations....,"Weel, this surely is one hell of a great live album. If you want itnroduce yourself to Saxon, it's a good start.The set list (ten songs) DOES NOT contain all their best material up to that point, when they had recorded four albums (but they did not use here any song from their debut album). Also this album is the debut of drummer Nigel Glockler, a very resourceful addiction to the band, replacing Pete Gill.It has tons of energy (altough ""Wheels of Steel"" gets a bit boring....). Good acquisiton, if you like compilations."
5,A Must Have For Any Serious Heavy Metal Fan!,"SAXON are the unsung heroes of the New Wave Of British Heavy Metal (NWOBHM). They came out around the same time as IRON MAIDEN and DEF LEPPARD, but had only a fraction of those bands' success. ""The Eagle Has Landed"" represents SAXON as an unstoppable Heavy Metal band. What they lacked in catchy commercial hooks, they more than compensated in the heaviness and aggression departments. This is indeed a very intense album with a sound lacking in most ""live"" albums now-a-days. This has to be simply one of the best live metal albums of all time, along with PRIEST's ""Unleashed In The East"" and MOTORHEAD's ""No Sleep 'Til Hammersmith"". It's fast, loud and uncompromisingly brutal. From the opening song, ""Motorcycle Man"" to the all out Thrash-before-Thrash of ""Fire in The Sky/Machine Gun"", this album will kick you square in the butt. An essential purchase for ANY fan of Vintage Heavy Metal!"
2,Do you like Covers?,"What a disappointment. This album is a collection of mediocre covers of the real Neue Deutsche Welle songs that I was hoping to find. I guess that trying to replace vinyl and cassettes is a fruitless task! Oh well, I guess you get what you pay for!"
4,A Good Disc,Meli'sa Morgan is more than just a Singer.She puts Feelings&Emotions into her Work.She Completely Re-Vamped Prince's Do Me Baby.She made it into a Gospel Type Song.Love Change's with Kasihif is a Classic 80's cut.She is Very Underrated.this is a Good Place to Start Listening to a Good Solid Artist.
1,Kumite Scam!! Dont buy it!,"First, this is not a DVD is very bad encoded Super VCD from a macintosh computer, this is a joke or what? The video quality and audio are awfull, the ""DVD"" doesnt contents the bonus okinawan tournaments scenes and doesnt ever teach nothing about kumite or tournament fighting. This is a scam from Yamazato videos. Too bad."
3,"""Nugent"" Ted Nugent's 1982 Album","I had NEVER bought this 1982 Ted Nugent album, up until now. ""Bound & Gagged"" seemed to be the song that I most remembered. ""Tailgunner"" kinda reminds me of 1975's ""Stranglehold"". I also like the songs ""Habitual Offender"", ""Good & Ready"", ""No, No, No"", ""Tailgunner"" & ""Bound & Gagged"", which is my favorite song on this entire album. ""Bound & Gagged"" mentions the Iranian Hostage Crisis in it's lyrics. How well I can remember the Hostage Crisis from November 4, 1979 to January 20 1981, which ironically was Ronald Reagan's Presidential Inauguration Day. Ted Nugent, like Judas Priest seemed a lot more noisier musically, which started w/ Ted Nugent's 1980 album ""Scream Dream"". I only give this album 3 stars."
1,Wrong Item or False Advertising?,"The charger I got did not fit the Motorola V188, wrong connecter. I was offered a full refund."
5,Great Pressure Cooker,"I ordered this stove top pressure cooker after researching various other types. I had an electronic pressure cooker which I returned to QVC. The quality of the Fagor is excellent, and I really like having the choice of using either the 8 qt. or the smaller 4 qt. saucepan to use for lesser quantities in recipes. Don't be afraid to order this pressure cooker. I had my mother's which was 65 years old. I stopped using it because it was made of aluminum. The Fagor is made of beautiful stainless steel. All the components are high quality. It comes with clear instructions and a nice little cookbook. You won't be sorry you ordered this pressure cooker."
4,A Nice Pressure Cooker Set,"The ""trivet"" doesn't seem very useful, but the rest of the set is great. Had to read the instructions and practice a bit, and I used Miss Vickie's ""Test Drive"" procedure [...] for familiarization. Since then, we have been cooking under pressure several times a week for the past 6 weeks. No problems whatsoever. Been pressure cooking more than 30 years and this is a nice improvement over my old aluminum Mirro 6 quart with the rocker weight. These new stainless steel Fagor rigs use a spring loaded relief valve to maintain 15 psi. Smooth cover action too... just lube with veg oil, occasionally, and pay attention to the key mark alignment. When cleaning, I remove the operating valve per instructions, but so far it has remained clean and free of particlesI like it."
1,Made in China!?!???,"Picked the Duo Combi set because I had read that the Duo Combi, Express, and Futuro were made in Spain. Imagine my surprise when I received a box with ""Made in China"" on it. VERY disappointed, as I paid more for the Duo Combi than I could have paid had I gone with another set. I have yet to bring it home or to try it. Maybe that will change my mind. Will update rating once I've used it."
3,Jury is out still,"My experience started out a little badly. I received the larger pot with a broken handle right out of the packaging. The manufacturer did send me a new handle without much hassle, so the recovery was good. Having been a long time user of a rocker top pressure cooker I find it a little difficult to determine if the cooker is fully under pressure and how to adjust the temp down to get the cooking/pressure correct. Having always had a larger pot having the smaller pot is kinda cool for smaller items I would not have previously pressure cooked. I also really like the option to relieve pressure without putting the pot under cold water. I will have to do some more cooking before I decide whether this was just an Ok or good purchase."
1,Don't get this!,"We received one of these as a gift. About 1.5 years after getting it my wife was cooking a pork bottom roast and the black parts (which are made of plastic) melted while she was cooking making the whole thing unusable. As if that alone wasn't bad enough, when she called them to try to exchange it for another they refused. Their customer service and commitment to they product SUCKS!"
3,DOES NOT CANN QUART JARS,"It does not hold quart jars for canning. The product info details it will hold 4 - 1 quart jars. I tried 2 different sizes of the ""standard canning jars"" Kerr and Ball, neither would fit, they were too tall and the lid would not seat. I switched to pint jars and it would hold 5 of them. That solved the problem for this canning round since we were doing olives. When we want to do quart jars, we're out of luck with this product. Have to use a standard water bath method-canning kettle, which is a fraction of the cost. I kept this product because we had to do the olives right away. With more time I would have returned it. It is a good standard pressure cooker, otherwise. Nothing special."
1,Do not buy - does not seal reliably,"I purchased the Fagor Duo set a couple of months ago. It has been nothing but trouble. It is incredibly hard to seal, often it won't seal at all. We are using this to make baby food so I keep trying to use it, but often it takes 20 minutes or more of messing around with the seal and the lid if I do manage to get it sealed. I'm a very handy person and a passionate cook, this should not be as difficult as it is. Often, when I put on the lid, the little yellow button will start to rise, but the moment I slide the unit closed, the seal is lost. It is so frustrating. The design is flawed.I don't know if there are better units or models, but the set I purchased from Amazon is garbage and a total waste of money. Spare yourself the frustration, burns and time and find something else."
2,Parts keep breaking,"We have bought a duo set in Bed Bath and Beyond. In less than a year the lower part of the handle broke, and the replacement costs around $15.It is now about 3 years that we own this pressure cooker and the valve has broken and it will cost me $16 to get a replacement part.I find it very annoying that such an expensive item keeps being costly over time. I guess it is great for Fagor to keep the money flow in, but they sell themselves as beeing Green, and therefore they should not use parts made to break every year or two!!!!Other than that, all the nice things written by other reviewers are true."
1,Fragile Handles or Poor Packaging?,"I purchased this pressure cooker set for my wife this past Christmas and the set arrived with broken handles. The handles on both pots were shattered and in multiple pieces. Due the positive reviews of the product, I did not hesitate to request a replacement which finally arrived today on January 10th. To our disappointment, the handles on the smaller pot arrived broken and in pieces again for a second time! Fagor's internal packaging clearly seemed inadequate to safeguard the contents during shipping. At the same time, it made my wife and I wonder about the durability of the handle material. Very frustrating to say the least. Buyer beware!"
5,"Great product, super service","Needed to replace an old pressure cooker that I loved so shopped on internet, decided on Fagor combi at Amazon,because of free shipping. Found at other merchants but would have had to pay shipping ( not cheap ). I will not shop around again untill I check at Amazon. Very quick service on shipping and packed extremely well. I especially chose this pot because of the 2 sizes but have used both and found this to be an exceptional product, easy to use and easy to clean. Cooks very well."
5,Fagor Pressure cooker,"Excellent. The first time I used it the meat came out perfectly cooked in much less time than doing it in the oven. It was moist and flavorful. I like the fact that there is a smaller pan (there are only two of us) so I can make a smaller and more economical amount. Altogether, an excellent product."
3,I question the open design of the helper handle & quality of handle material,"I researched quite a bit before purchasing this cooker, but was disappointed to find the helper handle was broken when it arrived even though there was no indication of any damage to either the outer shipping carton or the inner packaging. The helper handle has an open loop molded to a base that attaches to the cooker (visualize a capital D) so that you can grab the handle for lifting. I have to question: if it broke that easily in transit, would it also break if I bump it against the sink during washing, or might it break under the weight of a cooker full of food?"
1,Cheap handle and valve needs replacing often,"Fagor leads you to believe their pressure cookers are advanced and have some sort of genius European engineering. I bought the marketing and purchased a Fagor Duo. It works, but no better than other brands I've had in the past. The handle is cheap. I constantly have to tighten it with a philips screw driver. Worse, the valve doesn't stay put. It dropped out, broke and Fagor will not replace it. This is a $20 part. Buy any brand but Fagor."
2,Fagor does not back up its product,"I bought this product in August, and used the smaller pot right away. It works well. For Thanksgiving, I finally had cause to use the larger pot to pressure cook pumpkin for pumkin pie. As I was cleaning the pot, over the sink, it slipped from my hands, fell a couple of inches into the sink and the handle broke in several pieces!To my mind, a handle should be able to endure a bump on the sink! I wrote to Fagor, and their response was--go buy the replacement part. I really think it sucks that their handles are so cheap!"
4,Rebate not a very good deal,"While the Fagor pressure cooker and the pot that comes with it in the combo are both stainless steel and of good quality, the ""free"" pan offered with the rebate is teflon-coated aluminum. Notice also the $8.95 handling fee that adds cost to this ""free"" pan. If you are buying this combination from Amazon because of the rebate, you might want to check the details very carefully.Pat"
2,Save your money,"Most of this show makes little sense. The characters have very little depth. Trains are used for traveling between planets instead of spaceships, with no explanation. The trains must always travel along specific paths, except when they don't. These trains carry functional spacecraft, but they are only used as weak attack craft. Main character wants to be a soldier/cop, but insists on using a non-functional gun. There are trains that render you dead if you accidentally get on them. The trains can be destroyed with very little effort, and frequently are, but people still want to ride them. All the problems are apparently caused by one particular alien in a vast galaxy wide invasion force. The ending seems forced, like they got bored and just decided to end it, killing off most of the regular cast, in one last grand bang."
2,"Very cute, but WAY smaller than expected.","I bought this along with some of the books for my daughter (whose name is Ella). When I got it in the mail I was very disappointed with how small it was. I was expected it to be at least the size of a Beanie Baby or maybe a bit bigger, but it wasn't! I know I should have read the dimensions before I bought it. However, I think it is way too expensive for how small it is. I didn't return it though, because it is neat to have the elephant to go along with the books!"
3,Ella,"The item took a long time to arrive, not the ""normal"" AMAZON speed I am accustomed to. Ella was cute and as described - although very tiny."
1,never recieved the item,i am very disappointed as i had order this item for my daughter for xmas and it never arrived even after i called and was told to waitto this day it has yet to still arrive and this was the worst experience i have had with Amazon so far
4,Love the thief franchise,"This game plays very nearly like the PC versions of the first two Thief games. The story is okay and the pace is a little slow (but I think all stealth-style games are meant to be slow, anyway). Remember this was meant for the old platform (but will work on the 360) and the graphics did not improve over the PC games. Still, the game is quite unique in many ways that modern games still have not taken into consideration (I am still waiting for Assassin's Creed to work in a shadow meter!) If you liked the first two, you'll probably like Deadly Shadows (if you can forget how bad graphics used to be so many years ago)"
4,Killed or be Thiefed?,"The deadly shadows are truly admirable as they can kill you. The game is great if you like Thief Deadly Shadows. I agree with some reviewers that this is a video game. Xbox is a wonderful system for this title as if it were not on it, this game wouldn't exist."
5,This game is definitely for those who like to take cheap shots.,There is nothing like playing a game that requires every mission to be done virtually in complete darkness. Thief Deadly Shadows requires thieving skills such as pick pocketing and picking locks to open treasure chests and entering doors. Having to watch out for the gaurds is always a must even though you don't commit a crime. Hiding from the people who walk around at night really isn't necessary unless they see you commit a crime and they go and find the gaurd. When I have to attack somebody from behind knocking them out cold I always hide the body in a place where nobody will notice it and steal their valuables to sell at the black markets to make a profit.
4,A SOLID STEALTH GAME!,"I love stealth games. Thief is a fun game. there's different ways you can play, have both factions aligned or one or none. either way THIEF is fun . Graphics are descent (get an ""S"" cable,If your TV has a hookup).. Its no SPLINTER , but really the two shouldnt be compared. The time is set in the middle ages , or somewhere abouts. All in all very good stealth game. Cause I beesy weesy liksey the gamsey.That's the only anoyance those beesy weesy the waasey they talkseey. Id say THIEF is in the top ten of stealth games.I enjoyed THIEF DEADLY SHADOWS alot! but, SPLINTER IS STILL THE BEST! nanny nanny boo boo!"
5,Classic,"This play is a great comedy with heart, witty dialogue, and amazing characters. While the movie, starring Jimmy Stewart, is a timeless classic as well, there is nothing like a live Theater production. This book/script is perfect for any actor, Theater lover, or voracious reader who loves well written works."
5,Very Satisfied,This product is one great product! It is exactly as described and works great with the kitchen cabinets. Eliminates the need for measuring and marking... We were very satisfied.
5,Best Shelf Liner,"I tried two different clear, ribbed, non-adhesive shelf liners for our new cabinets before finally ordering this one when I couldn't find it locally. I'm not sure now of the brands of the others, but I got them at Menards and Wal-mart, and this shelf liner is better than both.This shelf liner is slightly more rigid and lays down flat easily, the material allows me to slide things in and out of the cupboard without the liner coming with and bunching up. It stays put. The ribbing is better than the others in that the ribs are taller but narrow and distinct, opposed to the whole liner being like rows of little hills... so it seems more air can circulate underneath.I put this in every drawer and on every shelf that might be subject to spills, leaks or messes, and I'm happy I did."
4,I don't understand the bad reviews here,"Kaplan won't reveal all of it's secrets in this book. But for $14 plus shipping this is more than worth it, just for the 3 free tests and answers keys alone. Some of the advice is helpful."
5,Girl Power!,"If you didn't get it, watch it again! They all have it. Even the housekeeper has it. Oh, and get this; urban, divorced, career mom, dresses well, has three cute kids, and gets a nice man! And wait! There's more! The DOCTOR says to the kids (of single mom), ""It's difficult to raise children right, and your mother had done it right."" This is 1948! Also, get this, for an immediately post-war movie -- they don't finish by moving OUT of the city -- they stay in it! A family! How great is that? There is even the odd little twist that the nice man, though sexy, I guess, for his time, is SHORTER than the lovely Irene Dunne, but it's not a big deal! And what about that cute song mom and kids sing? Speaking of which, the music is great. Jane Powell sings beautifully. Later, believe it or not, there's a harmonica concerto. This movie is odd but wonderful. At first I thought it was the stupidist thing I'd ever seen. Then I watched it again. Now I love it."
1,Tranquility Zone 7905 Adapt-A- Foam Pillow,"The pillow is small, and the cover is very rough. At the same price you can get a bigger one with a much nicer/softer cover at Target."
1,Rehash,"essentially a rehash of his other previous books, and not a useful tutorial because it doesnt combine photoshop options to do a single complete project which is disappointing for a book this expensive. it is to basic for advanced users also. is everyone else on drugs here or am i the only one not being paid to write reviews? shame on you guys."
5,GREAT Camera,"I own this camera for about 3-5 years.It still works sharp and clean.The close up (i mean the really close up) picture shots are SUPER crisp, better than any camera I've used. (Fuji film dedicated digital picture camera's close up shot sucks! Perhaps it's because something is in the lens, but it's fine when not zoomed up too close. )"
2,blurriness,I have purchased the pv-gs65 and everytime I use the camera with autofocus it makes everything blurry and only stays in focus for about 3 seconds. I returned my camcorder and got another one (pvgs65) and I am still having this problem. everytime i have used the camera i have to use manual focus.If anyone else has had this problem or knows how i could get this fixed please email me or post another review.brandonwg8677@comcast.netThank You.
4,"Great camera, with a few quirks.","I liked the camera a lot, but it has a few irritating details as compared to GS150. If I knew these before purchase, I probably would have purchase GS150 itself.The camera itself is fine, but the description doesn't indicate that you cannot transfer the video over the USB cable. You have to separately purchase the Firewire cable for that. GS150 allows you to transfer video over USB. GS150 comes with software for video editing, and it has a built-in lens cap."
1,When it breaks you own it even under warranty,We purchased this camera and overall it was a good camera. It took excellent outside video and was not a great performer in low light conditions but that is not atypical of today's reasonably priced miniDV camcorders. However after six months the LCD screen suddenly stopped working. It was not mishandled and the otherwise the camera works great. We sent it last November to the Panasonic authorized service center. They returned it three months later unrepaired because the part is not available. We were out $100 in labor fees plus we still have a broken camera that is less than a year old. I only share this as a warning to potential buyers. Panasonic did not honor our warranty!
3,Beware of support / Warranty on this Camera,"I bought this camera in January and have been very happy with the performance. Bang for buck, you really can't go wrong.HOWEVER, please look at the warranty on this camera before you buy. Panasonic has 12 months warranty - but the FINE PRINT says that after 3 months you, the consumer have to pay any service charges. Now we are into May, the camera mangles my tapes continually, and I have to pay for labour charges to get this fixed on a camera I have barely used and is still under warranty.....Panasonic does pay for parts - which are of course virtually free to Panasonic.... You will then need to send the camera away to a random 3rd party that may or may not fix the camera, and may or may not charge you a fortune for labour.Seriously sucks....."
5,A Treasure from the Depths of the Universe.,"I'm not a Mormon or a Christian,but I found this book to resonate with my own spiritual beliefs (not to mention the synchronizations that sprung up for me while reading this book) and loved reading just about every page of it.Thanks Carol Lynn for putting your thoughts into this very spiritual book which I am sure has touched and will touch more than just this one soul.A book I am sure to read more than once."
1,Save your money,"I love yodeling. I have heard fabulous yodeling of classical music, such as snippets by Bobby McFerin. I was excited to see this album, thought I might give it a try. Fortunately, the price tag made me look around the internet for a preview...glad I found it. Somehow this artist, though accomplished, manages to turn beautiful music and a beautiful vocal art form into kitschy shlock of the worst variety. Lawrence Welk, you have been upstaged!"
2,brianbot,"Brian sings wonderful old songs, but there is no heart or soul. Sounds like he is singing each song for the 1000 time, which he is."
2,The Missing Mystery,"This is an odd and ultimately unsatisfying book. The premise (a Game that revolves aroung Dante and the Divine Comedy) sounds wonderful, but it is completely under utilized and finally dropped completely. The settings and descriptions are well done, and the pictures scattered about the book are a nice touch. But the confusing thing is that Ms. Langton has a very bizzare concept of what constitutes a 'mystery.' For example, in a traditional mystery, the reader does not learn who the villian is on page 6! This strange technique basically removes any mystery to the story, and turns it into a not-so-thrilling thriller. Thus, this book's only saving grace is the descriptions of Florence, which is enough to elevate it above one star... barely."
5,Bird's Custard,"Unbelievable taste!!! 2nd to none. Doesn't like to be doubled or tripled from the original recipe, so watch that."
4,"It isn't blanc mange, but isn't bad . . .","I'm not sure that custard is really custard without eggs. But this comes close. I got it for use in a ""Vegan pancake"" recipe. We were having houseguests who were Vegan and I wanted to make some special breakfasts while they were here. One of the cooking/recipe sites had a recipe using this and there were lots of great reviews. I tried the recipe and it turned out like wallpaper paste -- yuck!However, the so-called custard isn't so bad. I think it's probably just cornstarch and annatto (yellow coloring with a slight flavor). It's fun playing with it. You could dress it up with fruit. Seems to come out on the thin side when you make it as directed, so I use less milk because I like my custards to set firm. As a custard sauce it's fine. I would say it tastes something between a pudding and a custard.If you want a really good egg-free ""custard"" get an original recipe for ""blanc mange."" It takes a lot longer to make, but it's certainly worth the difference."
4,Pudding,I use this product for a long time and I love it. I made custard egg tart and it taste just like custard.
5,Bird's Custard Power,It was great to be able to purchase Bird's Custard Power-Traditional as my Mother is English and we (the entire family) enjoy Bird's Custard with many different desserts. It is impossible to find the Traditional Custard Power in Colorado. A 600g container will last about 8 months as we do not eat much of it in the summer months.
3,What's Cooking Time?,"Bought Bird's Custard Powder and the instruction for preparing a pint of custard ""on the hob"", stopped after item 4 of the instructions which said, ""...bring to a boil over gentle heat, stirring continuously. It left out the amount of time it should be cooked.For Microwave, using the high power setting, the time is stated as 6 minutes. Gentle heat on a hob does not equate to high power heat in a MW. I have not used the product, but gave it a temporary 3 stars because I had to provide a rating for the review to be published.Anybody have suggestions about the amount of time simmer when cooking on a hob? Thanks."
4,The Dusty Rhodes Story,The DVD was exactly as described. It was sealed and arrived very quickly. Good service from the seller!
5,The Dream is clear.,"Entertaining and informative. A good story, and a must own if you collect WWE Biography DVDs. Tons of good extras as well."
2,Boring,"First of all.Please let me say that I have been a big fan of Dusty, in fact he was one of my all time favorites. But I was dissapointed with this DVD. I actually almost feel asleep while viewing it. There was too much talking, and even the wrestling matches have been edited. Word of advice, save your money."
4,WWE - THE AMERICAN DREAM - THE DUSTY RHODES STORY,The quality of the DVD's was very good. The packaging was nice too. The way the product was put together showed a very wide spam of Dusty's life in the wrestling business.
3,I'm Not too sure,"I'm not too sure about why the WWE is making a dvd on Dusty Rhodes I mean in my opinion his son Dustin probably did more for the business then he did. Of course I have only seen a few of Dusty matches and these matches basically dealt with his rivalry with Ted Dibase, a man they should do a dvd on, and Terry Funk. But I guess since he is a World Champion several times over and had such long standing rivalries with Ric Flair and other wrestlers it makes him deserving. I would rather they make a dvd on someone like Ricky Steamboat, Ted Dibase, Owen Hart, and Snuuka. I mean none of these men didn't win a world title but in their own way they contributed a great deal to the history of Professional Wrestling."
1,Why I Didn't Like This Book,"For some people, this book might have been great, but I found it rather boring. I just felt that I really didn't connect with the book like I do with so many others. Hey, I'm not trying to make it sound bad, it's just that this book might not be too exciting (especially when you have to write about it!)"
5,I never saw.....,"When I went to Washington D.C. for my class trip in 8th grade, we went to the halocaust museum, and I sat and watched a video (it was on interviews with survivors of the concentration camps) and I saw that, and I realized everything that happened was terrible. I started crying and could not stop. I had to leave- when one of my teachers had seen me, they sat with me outside, and I will never forget what I saw. I was the only person crying out of my eighth grade class, the only one. 200 8th graders went in there, and none of them were as touched as I was. I know this has not much to do with the book, but thanks to the teacher who saved all the drawings, so we could see, and what we will never forget."
5,Heart Wrenching,This collection of artwork and poems by the children confined to Terezin Concentration Camp is beautiful and thoughtful. I used it in my classroom to give my students an idea of what life was like for them. This is a great resource when doing a Holocaust unit.
5,A my name is Andrew,"I am a grandmother of soon to be 15, WOW!!! I found it very inspirational that a Grandmother wrote such a wonderful book. Her grandchildren are very lucky!! I hope she keeps writing! I have read it to all my grandchildren and they love it. It is a great book to read when you want some quality time with the kids. Great Job Mary, from one Grandma to another"
2,Writing a little overdone,"This book was purchased because my son's name is Andrew, but overall it wasn't as good as I had hoped. The writing seemed too embellished and the illustrations were the best feature. I was a tad disappointed in the content."
3,"Tiffany, WA",DO NOT buy this book if you are expecting a book about a child named Andrew. The book features the entire alphabet and each letter highlights a new child's name. Comprehensive and great creativity but NOT about Andrew.
1,Utter Garbage......,"The only reason I gave this album one star is because I couldn't give it zero.On the advice of a friend, I bought this album and I have not forgiven him since. Every track sounded just like the previous one, and I feel robbed of the time it took to listen to them. The singer is awful, the guitar lines are bland and the overuse of synth sounds can cause ones ears to bleed.Do yourself a favor and save your money for better uses, like q-tips."
1,Still Unavailable???,"I ordered this December 17th, and still have not received it. I am curious as to why the description still lists this title as ""ships in 1 to 2 weeks"" ?"
3,"Hmmm, Interesting!","I haven't tried this dvd but do intend to buy it. I'm not buying based on any of the reviews here because I do view them as suspect. As a linguist working for law enforcement and security agencies, I was put off by the fact that close to all of the reviews here do actually seem to be written by the same person--even the ones purposely altered. The linguistic patterns, sentence structure and consistency in punctuation/spelling are too similar and wouldn't fool anyone who knows what to look for. NONETHELESS, I rarely let reviews influence me unless they're mostly negative or too consistently positive to be real. In this case, I'm going to try this pilates dvd and hope for the best. LOL! The reputation of the pilates method over the years is encouragement enough. I'll just stick to reviews elsewhere on the net which are completely independent and separate from money-making ventures such as Amazon or B&N...they don't insult my intelligence."
1,Not what I thought it was going to be.,Were do you get a thing like this work out had. I believe it was called the reformer. I wished I would have paid more attention to it when I bought it. I was very disapointed with it. I also plan to resell it because I have no use for it.
3,Great bits on The Band,"Once again too much of Mickey Jones. He gets way to much air play.The stuff about Dylan is OK. But The Band material, especially later in the disc is great. Very enjoyable.I almost gave up on the disc early, my wife went to sleep, but the end was much to my liking.I think the title should be THE BAND and Bob Dylan and with a little better editing and a lot less of Mickey it would be a great Disc... Then it would be a 5 star disc."
3,sparse,"it's unauthorized and obviously they could get release for a lot of footage, so it was very limited in the music I was hoping to see."
5,"Bob Dylan a marvelous song writer and singer,","Dylan has been an icon for this age, his music in the 60s are still relevant in this computer age, and I recently bought about 7 new cds, that I had missed over the years, love to listen to the while I travel cross country on my Harley."
3,"Wish there was more, but it was okay","This was fun, but there's not much new here. Maybe, as a self-professed Dylanoligist, I might have been expecting too much. Still, I watched it and enjoyed it, but won't revisit it. The one new piece of information was the interview with the drummer who was kept on salary for the year that Dylan licked his wounds after his ""motorcycle mishap."" I've never thought of Dylan as being generous or even fair minded in this way, despite the ethical quality of his songs from day one. If you're new to this period of Dylan that follows his great trilogy of mid-sixties albums, you will find the DVD fascinating. If you've read some bios or know the bootleg Basement Tapes, you'll still have a pleasant couple of hours remembering how this artist's instincts moved in a startling new direction."
2,Apex Medium Duty,"I found this hose to be extremely flimsy (and had to return it in a day). It tends to kink a LOT. So, I strongly recommend that you look for something more substantial (I ended up purchasing one from SAMS club)"
1,"The Pod, Bean Bag Support.","I was looking forward to the arrival of this product. It was packaged well, looked great and was a resonable price. The ""Pod"" is stable on a completely flat, rough surface. But do not put it on the dashboard of your car, on an outdoor glass top table in windy conditions. The base can be slippery on certain surfaces. It is also not heavy enough for anything but smaller point and shoot cameras. I removed the plastic pellets and put in BB's. It is much heavier, but work much better! Rock solid in any condition., I also used so no-slip backling cloth to keep it from sliding off smooth surfaces."
1,Don't think I got what I ordered,"I am pretty sure I ordered the Manfrotto BOGEN TPR0017B The Pod - Bean Bag Portable Support for Your Camera, which is described as being 10"" in diameter. I received the Pod which is 3"" in diameter. I have a Canon 20D with the Tamron 70-300 lens that I was wanting to use the bean bag with and this one is totally insufficient. I'm not sure the 3"" one would even work too well with a compact digital camera. I decided to keep the 3"" one and try it with my small compact digital camera. I think it would be better without the screw too, where you can just place the camera on the bean bad so it can steady the camera."
4,"The Amazing, Unbelievable Ripley's","Ripley's Believe It or Not is a great bok. It contains many interesting facts, which will leave you in shock and disbelief. I thought Ripley's Believe It or Not was awesome. I had a lot of fun reading the book and I learned many amazing facts. Based on the T.V hit show, Ripley's Believe It or Not is mind-boggeling. Many people think that it is the same as Guiness Book of Records, but it is not. Ripley's Believe It or Not tells you amazing facts and you decide whether it is true or not. None of the facts in Ripley's are in the Guiness Book of Records."
4,There are SO many strange things inside this book!,"You got it folks. The RIPLEY'S BELIEVE IT OR NOT 2005 SPECIAL EDITION book. That's right. There's nothing stranger than the truth when you read this. It's all real. Just like any other ""Ripley's"" book, there are animals doing amazing things, people with nothing better to do then to decorate of their possessions in a wacky way, people doing things to themselves, and from everything from entertainment to fun to just plain weird, this is a wonderful piece of literature. Also visit the museums! They're not bad at all."
1,"crooked mind, bad taste",well i bought one for my son and after reading a few pages i almost wanted to throw it away immediately. The author or publisher is plainly exploiting kids' curiosity and interests in weirdness and cash in this.
5,A must buy,"This is the first of many in the long line of Solar recordings by Lakeside. Do you like pure soul, a heavy beat, good singing, slow jams? If so, you can't go wrong with Lakeside. I would buy anything Lakeside puts out. I am a true fan. A must buy!"
2,"attack the book, attack the book","Kind of slow reading, delt with [i feel] to much of there personel lives and just not that great of a book."
4,"This is a great 3 disc set, but I STILL WANT MORE!","11 year fan. Seen many live shows and collect alot of their stuff. I love these discs but like some of the other reviewers I was hoing for some newer stuff that hasnt been released on disc yet. I think the sound is excellent, the jams are great and sometimes amazing, with a nice mix of some of their slower tunes. Only wish is some new and older tunes not already released. With Mikey gone who knows what theyll put out next. Id like a studio album w/ McConnel. dont Panic!"
5,Jamming,"This jams, WSP is the number one Jam band in the world right now, no band can match the awsome magic that is produced here. The Grateful Dead, Phish are gone but not forgotten. WSP will be touring many moons from now, keep jamming.Eastcoast Phil."
3,Not the same...,"This set is not bad; there are definitely some moments (Drums on the 2nd disc is outstanding). But, as is so often the case, the CDs more or less precisely fail to capture the power of the live show.The sound is rather congested; perhaps too many guest performers ultimately spoil the broth. Too often, the mix fails to distinguish amongst the musicians in either placement on the soundstage, tone, or even volume; the net result is that instead of the complex music of which Widespread is capable, we hear noise. This is particularly regrettable given the apparently fine jamming that occurred at these shows..."
3,"Not bad, just predictable","This is not a bad album. Sound quality is great, the boys are playing great. Only complaint is that for many fans this is just sooo predictable. I was at the 3rd night of this run in Athens, and that night alone produced many a gem more exciting than what's offered here.As the reviewer below stated -- until wsp pulls a phish or dead (and really unlocks the ""live"" vaults) this is about as good as it's gonna get.All that said, if you are new to the band this isn't a bad start at all. Many good a tune here to get you familiar to the boy's live sound post ""Medicine."""
4,I want my Light Fuse...,"This is a great sounding, quality produced album from the boys, but I find myself hitting the ""skip"" button on the cd player more than I would like. Where are ""A of D"", ""E of G"" and ""B of D""???? These are truly Panic CLASSICS that contribute to the originality of the band, yet are sadly omitted here. There are a couple of great improvisational jams that we so look forward to at the shows, but my ears yearn for more. ""Blue Indian"" is included, but it sounds kind of muddled on this particular occasion. The highlight of this 3 disc set, I believe, is the ""Ride Me High>Drums>Time is Free"" scorcher on disc 2. All in all a great release, but a CD companion release of our beloved ""Live at Oak Mountain"" DVD would be more appreciated at this point. It has more of the tight jams and deep covers that make us love our boys. Until then, I guess I'll still wear out my copy of ""Light Fuse."""
5,Catch-Up With Some Boys From Georgia,"Throughout most of Panic's album career, the results have been great songs, but doesn't sound the same as live, baby, live!!!! Well, guess what, here comes 3 powerhouse discs from a dirty Georgia show!!! The sets are really solid, but I would have liked to have heard a few more rarities, as any Panic fan would. But the main reason why you should buy this set is because of the superior sound! John Keane knows how Panic should sound! Highlights include the funkiest ""Ride Me High"" I have ever heard, sick ""Blight"", ""Blue Indian"", ""Worry"", and the Southern slam ""Time is Free"" with Col. Bruce, aka ""Our Daddy!""Bottom line, BUY THIS SET! If you are new to the band, I would check out ""Light Fuse, Get Away"" before this one! But then again, you could just jump on tour and see the real thing!!!"
5,Unique Recipes,I have been looking for a Nicaraguan cookbook for the past 7 years. I am so glad that someone finally took the time to write one and an excellent one at that! Very easy to follow recipes... I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoy cooking!
5,"What delicious buñuelos, and so easy to make!","This excellent little volume is a welcome addition to the Central American cooking scene because it's the first of its kind and has such fool-proof recipes. I had no trouble at all in preparing buñuelos and other desserts unique to Nicaraguan coking, not to mention the great main courses such as vaho (steamed vegetables with beef) and the classical yucca and pork-skin appetizer, vigóron. Highly recommended!"
5,Great collection of songs.,In my search for instrumental music I borrowed this from the library and loved it! I just had to buy it. My kids and I do puzzles or build with legos to this music.
4,One Of The Most Influential Vocalists Of All Time,"Forget Country! This disc shows how Patsy was influnced by such jazz vocal greats as Kay Starr,Del la Reese,and Anita O'Day. In turn, this set shows they were influnced by her. Both ""Come On In"" and ""Down By The Riverside"" stem from O'Day's work with The Stan Kenton Orchestra. The use of the trombone on ""Hungry For Love"" as well as the trumpets and drums would be reflected by Kay Starr on her 1959 ""Movin"" LP arranged by Van Alexander. Finally,Cline,s vocals show a strong gospel influence which is the heart of Della Reese's style especially on Reese's 1961 LP ""Special Delivery"". This disc confirms Cline's place as one of the best vocalists of the 20th Century."
5,Delicious Snack Option,"Having tried a few other brands of pita chips, I have to say Stacy's is far and beyond the best. Perfectly salted - perfectly crisp - they are awesome for dips and salsa."
1,Loaded with sodium. Bad for blood pressure,To have 400mgm in single 1.5 oz. bag is unacceptable. In contrast Frito's Multigrain Sun chips have only 180 mgm sodium in same size bag.
2,"Not *that* low fat, it does have plenty of fat. Also has a lot of sodium.","This stuff tastes about as bland as salted rice cakes, so it tastes healthy, but really I don't consider 8g fat (0.5g saturated) or 12% (4% saturated) of RDA to be all that great. Packs 28g (9% RDA) in carbs and 400mg (17% RDA) in sodium.It's not a bad chip but for health matters it's just a normal bag of chips as far as Nutrition Facts are concerned.On the other hand, it *is* baked, has zero cholesterol, and contains all-natural ingredients (mainly flour, sunflower oil, and sea salt)."
5,"thanks, I (sincerely) needed that","Like lots of people, I bought this book when my Number One Cat Elvis was dying of kidney disease. In addition to feeling the sadness of other people's experiences, I also was able to do a few things just to make Elvis' life even better his last few days and minutes--I brought a towel from home and had him lay on it.The book also helped me deal with Elvis' afterlife, just remembering and writing freely about the little details of our relationship. We all mourn in different ways, and it's important that writings on the human-animal bond do include the human part.One of the unique things about Poynter's THE OLDER CAT is it's written in a relaxed and personal style, and has short sections, different fonts--something that will allure the cyber generation."

2,Barely detectable scent,"I think that the other positive reviews may be for the jasmine oil. One of them explicitly mentions it. This review is for the sandalwood oil. I'm in agreement with the other negative review. The scent of sandalwood is very slight, but the smell of whatever else is in the bottle is definitely more powerful. And that smell is a little better than unpleasant. Don't get this!"
5,Get it...very good for syntax!,"Kind of unique in its approach of syntax, very useful for those who want a solid foundation in this language"
1,Dissapointed,"Will I order this book on the disription say's its on a hard copy book but when I recieved the order I'm really disspaoited cus its ""instructors manual its a paper thin""."
1,You cant be serious?,"Ok so Ive never seen a whole charlie chan movie and probably never will so I cant judge the quality of an entire film. Its not surprising that all the reviews here trying to justify racism are written by caucasians. So since all movies in the 30's were racist, it makes them ok....what a crock! So people shouldnt complain about this movie because they were generous enough to allow an Asian to star in a film instead of using makeup to make non-Asians into a what a stereotypical Asian is supposed to look like. Oh brother, do you guys know what the definition of racism is? Yes people have a right to watch this film if they are so inclined. But people also have the right to say films like this belong in the garbage. Would caucasians complain if Native Americans made a film that depicted the genocidal acts of caucasians which include racial overtones? Come on its 2006, get real people, and get out of the trailer park please."
5,"Melissa, You Go, Girl!!!","I bought this CD on the day it was released, and now I can't seem to remove it from my CD player. I am not disappointed at all!!! ""Angels Would Fall"" is very nice, but there are lots of other great tunes on here, too, including the catchy ""Mama I'm Strange"" and the absolutely dreamy ""Sleep."" But my favorite is probably ""Scarecrow."" What a message there. I hope Melissa releases this one as a single."
5,A wonderful song with astonishingly beautiful lyrics.,"I was formerly not a very big fan of Melissa Etheridge. I have always thought that she is very talented but her music never struck a chord with me until I heard this song. The lyrics struck me as so beautiful and personal that I could not help but love it. My favorite line is: ""..If they knew you at all, Then one by one the angels would fall..."" What a wonderful way of saying how much you love someone!"
3,Classic game for a classic system,"If you like monopoly and super nintendo, you will enjoy this classic game. It's a little quiet so playing this game to a little music makes it more fun."
1,i would review if i had it!,"Well, I didn't receive the SNES version of this game! I got the NES version and I don't use my NES anymore b/c of how old and fragile it is. Maybe one of these days I will order the SNES version....and actually get it!"
2,Not worth the hype,"I'd wait until it does down to 5-10 dollars. The only enjoyable character is the sister that is mentally insane. Who cares about length, the story is typical of any anime-ish game/ movie. Pretty princess get into deep and defies the gods. Who couldn't have thought that plot line up? It's predictable and it has a lot of ""theme park"" style games like hit the bulls-eye. It's not worth full or any where near full price."
2,I Hated It,"So... I was looking forward to playing this, but I hated it. Hated. Loathed. I got so frustrated with it that I took it out of my PS3 and threw it on the ground and let it lay there for a few hours. The stupid throwing of the disk to hit the gong thing is so frustrating, I don't care who says it just takes a while to get used to. It's annoying - and I never got used to it. There's no meat to the game, it's just this weak storyline with freakishly sadistic characters -- all of whom I could care less about. Usually, despite any form of annoyance or stupidity, I play the game till the end. But not this time. I think I'm on the last level anyway- I hear there's only 6? Short (but at the same time way too long). Well... I'll watch the ending on youtube. I'm sure it won't blow me away.On the upside, the graphics are pretty. But, I just started Uncharted: Drake's Fortune which completely blows Heavenly Sword out of the atmosphere, hands down. So... eh... it's a double negative from me."
2,good graphics if you consider this game was released when ps3 was released. hack and slash to the end = boring.,good graphics if you consider this game was released when ps3 was released. hack and slash to the end = boring.
4,"Great ""hack them up"" Game....","This game was the second I tried on the PS3 platform. For the ""Hack them up"" genre it played very well. Graphics are superb and looks great on my 55"" HD-TV. Be aware that unlike Assassins Creed at 1080p it is only 780p. Not as good as the GOD OF WAR on the PS2, but to be fair the games are distinct and this one is fun, none the less. Probably 7-9 hours of fun for a hardcore gamer. About a week for your average casual player. PS3 games are overpriced... so shop around and wait to get the best deal."
4,A game ahead of its time.,"One of the greatest titles to release for the PS3 early into its life-cycle. While the media were split on the overall experience, no one could deny the shear magnitude of the experience developer Ninja Theory packed into Heavenly Sword."
4,Awesome in almost every way,"WOW WOW WOW. This is such a great game, same concept as God Of War yet I feel it is much better. The graphics are great, the character is smokin, and there is non stop action. Great game I say again. The hardest part of this game is the very end. Probably two of the most difficult levels I have ever played on a game. Defeating the boss is quite a task, two times even. However, the rest of the game is amazing and well worth the money."
2,just ok,"This game does have great graphics and a somewhat great storyline and a sexy lead charater but that's it. It's to short for one and annoying on the other hand. God of war was a much better game. I wouldn't reccomend buying this game at 60, go out and rent it because you can beat it in the time you rent this game. There really is no real replay factor to this game either."
2,"Beautiful Warrior, Ugly Mechanics","I know I should have listened to other reviews saying this game had awful controls and lot of repetition but what can I say, who doesn't love a sexy woman as a main character?*Spoiler Alert*There are times where you are positioned to either snipe with a bow and arrow or defend against an army with a cannon. Don't get me wrong that sounds awesome but; the controls are way too impractical. I am not complaining that the game is hard by any means just the controls are really sloppy and do not enjoy a game where the player has to adjust due to ugly game mechanics. If you can tolerate the horrible controls then by all means get the game if you cannot then do not even think about getting this game."
3,average,"it is a good game, a bit outdated maybe, the thing is that if you have played God of war 3 already you wont enjoy it as much."
4,Good overall gameplay,"Cons:-A few too many combos to memorize-motion sense junk with dualshock is really annoying (same for all PS3 games that include this IMO)-mixing cinema scenes with required button pressing was also very annoying, and no ability to replay afterwardsPros:-Decent story-ok checkpoints-choose your own style gameplay-nice graphics/cinema-unlockables for replay value"
5,Goddess Of WAr,"it has that lack of solidness that all new console game have. BUUUT is a very good action, game. lots of weapons? Chained swors, twin swords and a grand sword.. etc.awesome martial arts weapons handling.a beautifull NEO Cutting LARA character . incredible landscapes( i didnt like the flowing effect of her hair)but is a very good game considering it is part of the first ps3 generation. Is a Classic already,I should say, a must have. so you could say: Wach this.... this is how games looked like last year"
3,Not bad,"Not bad but not so good. I didn't like very much because of the control system. After this game, I've tried another game from Ninja Theory and they used a similar system, which I didn't like it either."
1,Short games are a waste of money,"Although this game may be really good, to beat it around 6 hours, it's not woth $[...].For that short time of fun I wouldn't pay more than $[...]."
1,BORING and awful,"This game is boring... so repetetive and boring.The graphics are only OK, not as fantastic as hyped up to be. Did I mention the storyline is boring? And repetative? Not worth your time."
1,Worst PS3 game I have played so far,"Heavenly Sword seemed like it had so much promise according to early reviews but once I played it myself I was severely dissappointed. The gameplay is very repititive and bland. Characters in the game are horrible and the controls sucked. Not to mention the game, after I installed it, actually caused many bugs in my PS3 console. The PS3 had difficulty playing Blu Ray movies as well as other games and after I uninstalled HS the console went back to working perfectly. DON'T BUY!!!"
5,Unparalleled Storytelling,"Emotionally charged, stunningly beautiful and delivering unprecedented dramatic character performance, Heavenly Sword showcases the power of Playstation3. A dramatic tale of revenge sees Nariko, a fiery red-haired heroine embark on a quest for vengeance against an invading King and his army. The story builds around the ancient Heavenly Sword which once belonged to a powerful deity. It can never be wielded by a mortal without it draining their life-force, killing them within hours."
3,JUST A PLAIN GOOD LOOKING HACK AND SLASHER GAME,thought it would be like gow 1&2 with a good involving story line bug disapointment. there is a story to it but a poorly told one. to me this game just done cut it story wise but if u just wanna kill a bunch of chit with out purpose then go for it. but i need more than just killing. would not recomend.
1,OVERATED,This game is garbage. A walk through for this game would read press triangle or square until your controller no longer functions. It's so repetitive and if you lose a battle you won't have any desire to repeat it. Don't buy this!!!
3,"Decent game, but really short","I basically liked this game-what little there was of it. It has great graphics, fairly smooth framerate, and solid controls. The story is interesting, and the boss battles are decent.And now the problems. First, the game is really short. I think I finished the game in under 8 hours. There are only 4 bosses and you fight the flying fox twice. The cutscenes seemed almost as long as the actual playtime. The game is also pretty easy-I think I died twice the entire game and that was during boss battles. It is mostly a button masher, but I really liked using the tilt controls for guiding arrows and cannon balls. Finally, there is really no replay value. Once you finish the game, hell mode is unlocked, but I really didn't want to play through the same levels again even if they were more difficult. There is no way this game is worth full price. I recommend renting it."
2,"Nice concept, poor execution.","I cannot believe how many five star reviews this game has received. Have you people really played this?I really wanted to like this game. But as I found myself quitting to play something else over and over, I never was quite sure if it was out of boredom from the repetitive gameplay, fatigue from the mindless button mashing, or nausea from the terribly over-acted voice work. It was dull, painful, repetitive and had a surprisingly shallow story throughout. The needlessly tacked on SIXAXIS elements were especially annoying.I eventually did finish the game, but I didn't really care. I have never turned it on since.Heavenly Sword wants very badly to be God of War. Unfortunately, it doesn't come close."
4,Kick @$$ Game!,"Loved the game. The graphics were great and the story was good. Lots of action, fairly easy controls. I just wished it would have lasted longer. I finished it way to quick. There were some challenging bosses at least. Nothing worse than a game that's too easy. Overall, a great game and worth the buy. Plus, the chick is bad @$$."
5,Phenomenal game. Plain and simple.,"All I can say is wow. From start to finish a rock solid game with great visuals and non stop action. Get this game, you will NOT be disappointed."
3,"Beautiful Game, no replay value","This is the first game I played for the PS3. At first I was amazed by the beauty of the graphics. Very well done and to me the best thing about the game. The game play itself isn't so great. There's not a lot of different things you can do other than swing your sword around. All the enemies have the same basic approach and become more of a nuisance than a challenge after a while. The story isn't that great either and is way too short. I like games that take more than a couple of days to complete. I also like replay value of a game, which this has none. Once you beat the game, that's pretty much it. Nothing special to unlock but artwork and maybe a video or 2, no extra levels, nothing. I see where this is compared to God of War a lot... this doesn't come close. All in all not a bad game, but I would recommend renting it rather than throwing down over $50 for it."
3,Rent don't buy,This is actually a great game. It has nonstop action all the way through. Unlike most games you don't bored doing the samething over again. If I had the oppurtunity to buy this game again i wouldn't. This game ends fast and is not worth the 60 bucks that you will pay for it. It's great for those long weekends that you sit and play. I would have rented it if i had the chance to. I hope this review helps.
4,Freakin awesome..,"EXCELLENT GAME!!Graphics, Story line, Gameplay... EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT AND.. EXCELLENT!!i heard the game was short... i'm 5 hours into the game and it seems like i'm towards the end of it. And... is one of the reason's why i'm giving it a 4 out of 5. (just added: I just finished the game... 6 hours total.)other reasons: Few audio bugs in some cut scenes, minor graphic bugs from time to time... and the loading time is long.Regardless of the minor problems, it's an excellent game and it's worth the 60 bucks, even if it is a short game.MUST BUY!!!!"
4,"Short, yet fun","As I'm sure you've read from other reviews, this game is a tad short. This is not a bad thing, though! I prefer my games not be 80 hours.The animation is great and the storyline is fun. The woman that plays Olivia from the TV show ""FRINGE"" is the main character's voice.The fighting is fun, the shooting is okay. Overall, we liked it."
3,Fun ride but..,I enjoyed the characters and the plot and had an absolute blast - I was entertained - I was glued to my seat... for about seven hours... then I was done.. I wanted more.. I wanted a reason to play it again.. I did not get either... well there was a slight urge to play it again but knowing that purchased it used and could get full credit for it at the placed I purchased it at combined with the desire to play the game I could of chosen instead caused me to drive over and trade it in within eight hours of purchasing the game. If you have a store that has a deal similar to my local one I suggest grabbing it over the weekend and returning it but I cannot suggest owning it.
3,"With small improvements, it could have been perfect","This was one of the first titles I owned after my first purchase of a ps3. I loved it then and ignored the flaws. The story and dialogue both have glaring setbacks. Graphics are still impressive, but as I am replaying this now, the combat is very frustrating. That's not to say the game is not fun to play at all. It's just that if there was just a little more fine tuning, it would have been that much more addictive."
4,Victorious game at gore,"This was actually a good launch game for the PS3. It was good enough to hold off till GOW3; well if it had DLC i'm sure it would of lasted that long. The graphics till this day are very great, the voiceover is pretty cool. The main character you grow to love and you take controls of the somewhat failed motion controls with the PS3 controller. ummmm I think this game deserved a sequel but do to bad timing this game didn't reach it's full potential do to PS3 high price tag and developer low on cash. This is really one of those games that should had a sequel or maybe a port to PS Vita but sadly Sony doesn't know how to profit off underground hits games like this.I'd say this is worth the 14.99-$20 pricetag"
5,Absolutely Beautiful,"If I could give it more than four stars I would. It gets four stars for just being an extremely fun game to play. It gets bonus points for how absolutely beautiful game it is. The artists and actors really did a great job on this game. And yes I said actors, you can unlock special feature vidoes and discover that the main villian king Bohan is played by the same guy that did the acting for Golem from Lord of the Rings and Kong from King Kong. The game goes by fairly quick but once you beat it in normal mode you can play it again in hell mode."
4,"Wonderfully Imaginative, Clever and Consistent","Enjoyed it! This I believe was the first of a series of stories of the Polesotechnic League and introduced the flamboyant character of Nicholas Van Rijn. The story moves nicely with the human-heroes trying to get back to an area of safety (because the food on this world is poisonous.) In order to pull this off they have to work with two waring factions on the planet. Along the way you learn all about the culture and the world these factions live on. There is also a extra lesson on leadership supplied at the end. What I enjoyed the most was Anderson's ""World Building."" Which was Wonderfully imaginative, clever and consistent."
5,Simply an Amazing Book in a league of its own!,This book is truly profound and enjoyable to read. It is a guide to operating you in way that makes living more meaningful. This is an incredibly insightful book that truly has changed my life and that of my family.
4,Another Great Lurkers Album,"There really is never a 'gamble' when buying a Lurkers album. If you like any of their earlier CDs, then you will love '26 Years' just the same :Arturo Bassick delivers another 15 power pop punk master pieces. From the energy loaced 'Ready and Loaded' to the final note on 'Never use that Gun', this album is pure fun. So do I not give it 5 stars ? Because my all time favorite Lurkers album is still 'Wild Times Again'."
2,hard cookies,cookies are very hard to bite even for little ones strong teeth. Bought for a birthday treat for pre school. Kids just licked on frosting which is also hard. They didn't appear to be to happy which I thought would be a big surprise seen as all kids love sponge bob. Real disappointment.
3,spongebob cookies,The product was exactly what I ordered. The only downfall was there were a lot of broken cookies that came with my order
4,CONFUSING!,ONCE AGAIN I LIKE PASCALE BUSSIERES AS AN ACTRESS SO I WOULD PRETTY MUCH WATCH ANYTHING SHES IN BUT THIS MOVIE CONFUSED ME ALOT I DONT KNOW IF HER CHARACTER WAS TELLING THE TRUTH OR LYING ILL HAVE TO WATCH IT AGAIN TO GET IT. BUT I GUESS THATS WHAT MAKES IT GOOD (I GUESS)!
4,Gripping and Poetic Story of Suffering,"This book is deceptively simple in its narrative, told in second person, like the voice of a loving yet impassive God. But the images and dialogue create a lace-work of references that are meaningful and reverberate long after I finished the book, which I couldn't put down. While reading I did find myself impatient with the mother's choices and behavior, and that was the only resistance I had while reading this beautiful book."
2,Full of Statistics?,"If you want to know all of the numbers of F1 they are here. Unfortunately, there are no curcuit maps, no information of nationalities of drivers and the statistics end in 1997. As well, there are mistakes in the information. For a statistical book this is something I can't forgive. I spotted many errors and that is just things I know (come on Michael Schumacher driving a Ferrari in 1994!). It makes me wonder what else is wrong."
2,Expensive,"This is a pretty good book, it has lots of detail and is well written, but its all in black and white and it doesn't cover any of the technical aspects of the cars and how they changed over the years. Overall I was very disappointed and the book is pricey, plus it only goes up to the '97 season."
3,manufactured,"The 13-track debute album from a French TV talent contest winner reveals impeccable arrangements, utter polish of styling, great technical teamwork and virtually top grade new R'n'B. All of which rank medium (not mediocre) for this position withn the hierarchy of pop. All lyrics are in French while tunes persue a typical US-rooted cosmo-flaved urban hip-hop pattern, with exception of closing piano+vocal number attempting a Carole King type of ballad. An admirer of newer Destiny's Child girlie trend will like this one immensely whereas a traditionalist may throw up if long subjected to the sound. Artfully studio-produced and quality recorded by experienced BMG engineers but washed of passion."
2,95% GREAT-5% WRECKING CREW,"I have the original GREAT recording on LP and thought how wonderful to have the CD. Unfortunately, and not disclosed is 15 minutes of the loud mouthed television Gleason which runins a magnificent album. How can I play the CD without hearing his shouting? I would return it but have played it. On the back cover there is small wording of ""BONUS TRACKS"" which a person takes to mean ..more music. No reflection on AMAZON . COM but in my business we file for misrepresentation on the recording studio!..See my positive comments on Jazz Concert Carnegie Hall 1938..WOW! CWF"
5,a must see,"If you?re interested in swords or practice any of the Japanese Sword arts, this video is a must-see. It explains kata and techniques in great detail and now I know much, much more than when I started. This is the standard by which all others will be compared."
3,Watermarked CD... slight challenge,"I LOVE CHESS... BUT IT REQUIRES TO USE THE CD to play... and that is truly a tragedy, ladies and gentlemen."
3,Chess master Software is cool but power hungry,"I have used chessmaster around 12 years ago and the chessmaster 9000 interface is still the familiar old. However, I ran in to an issue which I remember running in to 12 years ago as well. In the middle of the chess master session, my computer freezes. Looks like the software is really power hungry. My laptop is not all that great for running this type of a game. However, I did not expect it to freeze my laptop regular basis. Once in a while would have been ok. I am working on this issue now and will update my review based on the outcome."
1,Customer abuse,"The game itself is OK--not great, mind you, but OK. But to be unable to play a piece of software that I paid a lot of good money for until I get up from my computer, track down the disk, insert it, take it out, put it back on the shelf, etc., etc., is such abominable customer abuse that I've now had enough! I refuse to play this game anymore and will NEVER buy a Chessmaster game again. I find it incredible that so many people are willing to put up with this garbage! I have scores of software disks I've bought over the years and Ubisoft is the ONLY one that makes me prove over and over again that I'm not cheating them out of their money. Do NOT buy this game unless you think this gross customer abuse is the way things should be!"
1,Chessmaster 9000,"This game from Ubsoft, which I just returned, would not load on my computer (new system). Another game from Ubsoft, which I purchased and returned last year would not load on my old system.This time around I dealt with Hitgaming.com and they were very helpful in first trying to help me Chessmaster 9000 to work and after no success, helping me with the return.I am done with Ubsoft....."
2,Problems on install,"I had a very difficult time installing this game, eventually contacting ubisoft tech support and installing the game in the computer safe mode. I enjoy the game very much, but it was a hassle to install."
4,Convenience,I have two computers a lap top and a desk top. I used the software for a while then I was told I have to have the disk in to continue to use disk number one. This is very inconvenient. If I had known this I would not have bought the product. Also sometimes it is difficult to make a move.Jim Headrick
2,Cute Idea to me..not to the hampster.,"When I saw this I thought ""I HAVE to get this for my hampster!"" I have his cage in our living room and a play pen set up so I decided to put his own ""living set"" in the play pen. You know..he sniffed around here and there but wasn't all that into it. This might be great for dwarf hampsters but my hampster (siberian) was a bit too big for this and couldn't really play around with this. Shame!"
5,soth lights and hard country music,"I don't listen to modern country music because simply it is not country. But when you hear Moe Bandy sing those beer drinking songs about life then you know that's country he's up there with George Jones, George Straite, Allan Jackson, Vern Gosden,and Merl Hager.I love real country!!!"
5,The only Moe Bandy cd you need to buy.,Only thing you need to go with this cd is Joe Stampley's greatest hits.This cd is great if you liked his songs back in the 70's and 80's including the duets with different artist.
4,"Preserving you family Photographs: How to organize, present, and respotre your precious family images","Since I love photos old and young, I really enjoyed this book. It is important that we save what we have regardless of importance at this moment. I believe this book is a good way to learn how to handle our photos carefully so our descendants will have the joy to go through our photos."
3,Not much different from the author's previous book,"I agree with the previous reviewer. If you own a copy of the version 8 book, you can definitely skip this one. The only new info included in this book is a survey of PL/SQL IDE's and their built-in debuggers (this might be the only added value to this edition), summary of Oracle8i PL/SQL new features, and Java external procedures. Other chapters are practically identical to those in the older edition. In fact, the chapter on the DBMS_LOB package has been removed from the printed version.If you need to learn Oracle8i's new PL/SQL capabilities, pick up Steven Feuerstein's Guide."
3,Great Book BUT ......,"I bought this book just have a reference copy regarding PL/SQL. As oracle has come up with new version 8i and it's quite popular in the market so I wanted to have a book which can cover my PL/SQL concept and keep me up regarding latest update in 8i.This book is a disappointment, may be a bad choice for me. It actually validate it title quite closely. It is absolutly an advance book not for beginner or middle level guys. If you are looking for a book which can give you all the concepts and advance then probably this is not the book for you.This book really starts in advance mode. Even for the middle level guy like me I really feel to buy oracle 8 book instead of a Advance book like this."
5,How to Rock a Tribute Album,"It is SO incredbily hard to rock the house with a tribute album--every fan knows the disappointment of listening to a bland and flaccid compilation. Yet HOT HANDS more than successfully blends the many ways musicians have been influenced by the dark, raw power of THROWING MUSES/Hersh/et al. into a heady, exhilarating stylistic trip through 17 interpretations of MUSES tunes: it also RAWKS!True to the spirit and variety of the independent music scene and the way in which influence crosses across musical categories, the disc brings together a truly awesome variety of styles, everything from folk-tinged guitar ballads to synth-heavy dance tracks. Favorites: The Blood Group's 'Buzz,' Dirty Power's 'Hate My Way,' Phil Locke's 'Uncle June and Aunt Kiyoti,' Flare's 'Dizzy,' Taikonaut's 'Night Driving,' and John Ashfield's 'Portia.'"
5,What tribute albums should be!,"I've got an early copy of this CD and it's GREAT! The songs are not just great covers, they're great music. Period. This is an excellent collection, both for Throwing Muses & Kristin Hersh fans, and for people looking for an introduction to some great new bands they may not heard of."
4,Good cocktail lounge music (not elevator music),"This is good music to have in the background for soft conversation, slow dancing, and, yes, seduction. This is good smooth jazz played by the masters of the form such as Stan Getz, Sergio Mendes & Brazil 66, Jimmy Smith and Wes Montgomery, Cal Tjader, Astrud Gilberto, Walter Wanderly, and others. It has that Bossa Nova beat to it. Great summertime listening!Somebody wanted to know who the female vocalist on the first track is (No, it sure wasn't Stan Getz! LOL) It's Maria Toledo who was married to Luiz Bonfa who plays with Stan Getz on this cut.This is '60's music and, as I noted, cocktail lounge music. The performers are definitely those best versed in this kind of truly smooth jazz. Recommended for relaxed and for romantic occasions."
1,"Sorry, but where's the work?","I've been very excited about a new TC's release. I bought the Mirror COnspiracy in Buzios, Brazil and I've loved it!But what's the merit to put all a very well known bossa catalog under a TC label?It's another Verve compilation for God's sake!"
1,A Huge Step Down,"This has to be one of the most unoriginal records I've heard in a while. When I first heard that Thievery Corporation was coming out with a new record I was so excited. I bought the record the day it came out and played it in immediatly and my jaw just dropped. I listened to the whole record in denial thinking it would get bettter but it just didn't. They basically sampled almost complete tracks from some not so hot Verve recordings and put it to a bossa nova style beat, which Thievery is known for however they used that same beat on practically every track. I would not recommend this record if you like their other records."
1,Elevator jazz,"This is 60's jazz. Be aware before you buy, the label in the store was misleading. Not remixed, just picked off old albums and listed under Thievery Corp's name. If your not into the sound of hokey old jazz, stay away. I like the sound of today's music, influenced by the past, not 40 year old elevator tunes."
5,Great *JAZZ* album... TC only selected old tracks.,"I find it funny that so many Thievery Corporation fans are reviewing this disc. This is pretty much a JAZZ disc of music from the 50's and 60s with tracks that just happen to be chosen by the Thievery Corporation. There was no sampling or editing, or anything. Just original music from 50 odd years ago. With all that said, I find this compilation to be excellent. If you like Bossa Nova, or some cool laid back jazz, then you'll probably like this disc. The music is lively but light. Give it a try, if you do, all your wildest dreams will come true. Ok, maybe not, but this is one fine CD."
5,Nice.,"This is nice music. Jam jazz lol. This is not your typical Thievery Record, you may want to preview it before you buy it. I am happy to expand my record collection in this direction. Good music."
5,Not Your Classic Thievery,"This CD by all means is not like Thievery's other stuff. When I first bought the album I was a little disappointed. I had boughten ""The Richest Man in Babylon"" and had fallen in love with these guys. So when I got this CD it just didnt do it for me at first. It was just all jazz tracks. But I took it with me one day to the library to study with and I have to admit it is really a great CD. I am glad I bought it. All the tracks are really amazing once you get into them. But hey if you're not into jazz dont buy this cd."
4,Thievery Corp kicks!!,"If you are r expecting the usual sound of Thievery Corp in this album, u ain't getting any here. Totally different vibe yet excellent. This albim is jazzy with a little bossa nova. And it also has a little touch of middle eastern sound in a few tracks. Thievery Corp has made classic jazz alive again.These two guys has proved that they can do something different this time and yet sound so good!Warning: If u r not a jazz fan, forget abt buying this album!Advice: Jazz and bossa nova fan: add this to your collection! Its worth your money spent!"
4,A martini for your ears,"Granted, there are some weak cuts here, but the Astrud Gilberto take on ""Light My Fire"" alone saves the whole album, and there are other cool songs in here: ""Chove Chouva"", ""Batucada"" and ""Menina Flor"", just to mention three. So, if you like Brazilian Jazz, get it, if it's DJ-electronica what you looking for, forget about it. This one here is strictly for the bossa-nova-and-martini crowd."
3,Blood-Red Velvet,"Solid pick up. Very loungy. A few tracks are pretty weak, a little too in-the-clouds, wimpy. But definitely an interesting adoptation of South American beats and percussion with jazzy-smooth vocals over classic songs. One of those albums that expands your musical horizons. At times quirky, but often hip--like blood-red velvet."
4,cool & simple,"I don't pretend to know the genre very well, but I know what I like, and what I like a lot is this cd of cool latin-flavored lite jazz. It's pretty much an easy listening album with hip pretensions, but sometimes that is all it takes to satisfy. An excellent addiitona to a music library. I also am enjoying Verve Remixed by the same group that pulled this collection together."
3,HEY - WHO'S THE FEMALE SINGER ON TRACK 1,"Why does the track just mention Stan Getz (sax) and the composer Luiz Bonfa WITHOUT EVER MENTIONING THE NAME OF THE FEMALE VOCALIST?????PS: WHO IS THE FEMALE VOCALIST OF ""MENINA FLOR""???????Couple of OK tracks, but rest is a little dull"
4,Davy Jones Toy,"It is a very solid good toy and I love playing with it, but it isn't really 8 inches. But the detail on the toy makes up for it and I recomend it for Pirates of the Caribean Fans."
1,yuk,"The advice was ho hum, but the disturbing undercurrent about the book was the basic definition of a ""fabulous girl""--the world these authors describe is a world in which the FG is one who may have sex with anyone, anywhere, any time, etc. Example, on sex in public: ""sometimes she just can't help herself."" On having VD: ""You realize that it could have been one of five men who gave it to you and that means you may have given it to any and all of the others. Ugh."" Ugh indeed."
2,Not your traditional etiquette book,"This book is kind of cute, but it was definitely not what I expected. To be honest after attempting to read the book several times I gave up without finishing it. The advice the book does give on etiquette is just plain common sense. There isn't anything ""sticky, tricky, or outrageous"" about the situations described in this book.If you're looking for a book of how to handle modern day etiquette I would definitely read ""Things You Need to be Told"" by the Etiquette Grrls."
2,Not a fan,"This book is a little silly. Not much practical advice that isn't common sense. I should've known that it would be that way when I heard the authors complaining about people chewing gum on TV. People chew gum, be glad it isn't tobacco and they're not spitting all over the place!If you want and ettiquette in it's pure form, get the big old Peggy Post book. This seems like it's more how to be a snotty, yuppie than a poised, respectable young woman."
1,Dangerous,"My son just bought this last night at Petco for his 7 month old Boxer, within minutes of her getting it she was chewing pieces off. It is not tought like they say it is. There were small black pieces all over the floor. My son took the toy away and that night the poor thing vomited all night...she was so sick it really scared us. I am contacting this company today to let them know. I do not recommend this toy at all."
5,One tough toy,"I have two pit bull terriers that are super tough with toys. These are the only thing that has lasted years, yes years with my dogs. I use them mostly for outdoor play time, and they stand up to being exposed to the elements pretty very well too. There is one frozen in the snow as I type this!The attached ropes may wear out a bit over time, but your dogs will definitely get thousands of miles out of playing, tugging and trying to tear up the tires."
4,Great shirt - expensive shipping,"I just ordered this shirt - assuming I received it in a timely manner and it is the correct shirt/size, everything is fine except I thought the shipping was a little high. The shirt was $18 and it cost me $7 for shipping. No special shipping, just regular. I know you can ship T-shirts cheaper than that. Other than that - everything should be fine."
4,Evocative,"Evocative, dreamlike portrayal of woman and soul. Much substance, deeply layered. Imagery is gritty, beautiful, real, and stylish simultaneously. Everything is described until you feel dreams are tanglible. Bless you Anais!!"
3,NOT her best,"I could be missing something, but this novel seems unbalanced. Maybe because it was pieced and re-pieced together in several different ways at several different times?Also, she has mentioned her characters aren't necessarily understood in the typical sense because she really focuses on their subjective experienc0es.And I tried to remain cognizant of that, while experiencing character portrayals that seemed to contradict themselves. However, for me if just detracted from the story. It seemed almost as if she were going out of her way to be gratuitously melodramatic and analytical.And it reminded me once again of how painful it can be to either feel too much or know somebody who feels too much.That said, this book contains some absolutely beautiful phrases and penetrating insights, as is typical of Anais Nin.I prefer her diaries and 'The Spy in the House of Love' to this book. That's just my opinion."
2,Caught off-guard,"I was kind of shocked when I opened this to see how NOT sturdy it was. However, it is holding up to a very routy French Bully and my new Aussie Silky. They do drag it around, which I think is fun in itself. However, I do have one complaint: the wire brackets on the inside fold up on themselves therefore collapsing the box. That's a drag. I think it's pretty rugged for being cloth!"
4,Good to keep things in place.,It's VERY colorful. Good to keep everything in one place. My dog has learned her way to the toys. It can feet a good amount of toys.
3,Too high,"This toy box has withstood moderate use. We store the dog toys in the box, and our dog hasn't shown any interest in chewing the box or dragging it around, therefore, I can't say if it stands up to being used as a toy. However, the sides are too tall for a short dog. I have a Welsh Cardigan corgi and we had to bend the sides down or he gagged himself trying to get to the toys. I need to keep looking for something shorter. This is a fine product for a taller dog."
1,Don't waste your money!,"This product is WAY overpriced. It also doesn't hold up good at all. My shetland sheepdog bounced on top of it, and the two metal rods inside of it came out and poked him! I have mine filled with puppy toys and it won't even stand upright. Complete waste of money!"
5,Great!!!,"Received product in great condition, in record time! I was very pleased with the fast service and the condition it arrived in. Would not hesitate to order from their firm again. Already my dog is learning to put his toys in the box and get them out!! It is so much fun!!! Shows how smart Labradors are and how quickly they learn."
1,Disappointing and Inaccurate,"My biggest problem with this book is that it contains much misleading information on investment banking -- particularly with respect to securities law. As a former corporate and securities attorney and now investment banker, I found that at many points Liaw was at best half right and at worst completely wrong with respect to some of the finer points of the financing process. The book also contains numerous grammatical mistakes that are extremely distracting. (I would have expected more from John Wiley & Sons. Next time please hire a proofreader!) Is that too much to ask for an $80 book? In fairness, I did not get past the first 3 chapters of the book so perhaps the book gets much better later on, but I sincerely doubt it. In short, this book is not worth the money."
4,Fair,"I have 10+ years of experience in the space but still learned a few things.With that said, it was not worth ~100 dollars. The book is overpriced, this is clear indication that there needs to be another book in the domain that delivers more value for a lover premium.If you don't have a network in the IB/FS arena, then read this book, if you do, then have lunch with a few Managing Directors from the top 10 Firms and for ~200 dollars (the cost of a few lunches/breakfasts) you would have had four times the value.Sounds like a good investment to me.-Richie Etwaru"
2,"An elementary, cursory review of this complex topic","This book's contents significantly depart from the back cover's promise. It is not a ""thorough and rigorous analysis of the current market practices."" While this basic review could be used as an introduction piece for those that think a TIGER is only a jungle cat and call has something to do with a phone, the book will provide little insight for those with even a basic business school background."
3,good overview but expensive,"This book is a good overview of the investment banking business, but it is quite expensive. I would strongly recommend instead or in addition the Vault Career Guide to Investment Banking.... The Vault guide includes more detailed overviews of all the departments and functions of an investment bank including corporate finance, M&A, sales, trading, private client services, credit, etc. If you are a job seeker in investment banking also try the Vault Guide to Finance Interviews, which contains actual investment banking finance interview questions and answers and which I found to be enormously valuable in my Wall Street job search."
2,Not what it seems at first look,"It's probably a good book for those who are freshmen on the topic and want a book easy to read. But it's unusefull if you want a more deep-through looking into the topic of investment banking.The author remains too much time on laws, history, and so forth, and doesn't explain the key topics of banking. Good book if your research is about the history and legislation of capital markets.""The Complete Guide to Capital Markets for Quantitative Professionals"" is a much better book if you want to know terms such as dealers, underwriting, clearinhouses, and the basics of stock markets and bonds."
4,"Very good, but not specific to job seekers","This guide is quite thorough, though I thought the ""VaultReports.com Career Guide to Investment Banking"" was more useful to me as a job seeker."
5,Happy Valentines Day,Watch was for my lady friend who loved it . Great value for A very good looking Seiko. The watch is good for dress and casual wear and it even tells time.
5,Beautiful Watch,I have owned this watch about 2 months now and so far its been great without any issues. I was more impressed when I saw how beautiful this watch was when it arrived. The pictures does not do it justice!
5,"The Best Hardcore Band, EVER!","No one puts on a show like I-Defy, and it transfers well onto CD. High energy and amazing talent makes this band one of the greatest ever. These guys know how to rock out and how to have fun. They are never above joking around or letting members of the audience sing with them. I have sang ""Your America"" along side Brent countless times. They may be my friends, but don't let that ruin your idea of this band. I am a friend because I am a fan. No one can hold a candle to them at all. They should be touring with bands like Bleeding Through, Hatebreed, Eighteen Visions, Agony Scene, and Atreyu. Buy this album if you have any sense of music!"
2,Leaked and easily kinks,"When I opened the box I was excited because the hose looked of solid quality. However, when I hooked it up, it started leaking just behind the connecter (where the metal connector connects to the rubber hose). I would have attempted to try and patch it, but I also found the hose to very easily kink at the slightest bending. Maybe I was spoiled by my other hose, which is a Sears Craftstman. I use it for my backyard. I bought the second hose for the front. It is going back to Amazon."
4,Don't let this game pass you by!,"I've owned every bowling game ever made for the Playstation 1. While I've enjoyed them all, some were better than others. Strike Force Bowling is the first bowling game for the Playstation 2. It's a simple, modest beginning. The game is easy to pick up and start playing. There's a standard alley and a bunch of unusual ones. The graphics are solid, pin action is terrific!, and the adjustable camera angles are a welcome relief to other games that didn't offer any. Overall, Strike Force Bowling is a very enjoyable game with enough variations to keep you occupied for some time. Don't miss it, especially at this price!"
5,jess & darrel,strike force bowling is a fun game to play with the whole family i like all the different charactors thay have in it and its really easy to learn and would recommend it to everyone who enjoys bowling
4,A military thriller with a business twist,"David Freedman is an insatiably curious person and a fine writer to boot--a felicitous combination for any subject he tackles, and the Marines are no exception. Corps Business reads like an entertaining military thriller--complete with battleroom strategizing, cigar-chomping colonels, and battle-fogged maneuvers, and if this were ALL the book were about, it would STILL be an enjoyable read. But what distinguishes Corps Business is the next level of reporting Freedman brings to his story--weaving in relevant, current, and timely analogies from today's New Economy business world that serve to reinforce and further illustrate the Marine's corps values. If you like your business ""medicine"" to taste good, like escapist pleasurable entertainment, then you will love the book!"
5,Only For those That Can Handle The Truth,"This might not be the ""management guru advisory"" that some academics would recommend but when you look at 235 years of developing one of the best managed and most successful fighting forces in the world it just might have something in it for how we manage business and our own lives. There is a lot more to it than just ""search and destroy"". Civility, support, purpose, flexibility and common sense have a lot to do with it."
1,Essence of Shorin Ryu Karate,"I got this DVD because it said,""Secret techniques"" also ""Hidden fighting techniques"".I Still have not seen the BIG secret or the hidden.Thats right it's hidden?Also it shrink my belt becouse I come from one of the old ways of Karate [Shorin Ryu].Yes I know there are moore.My Sensei was #66yrs.old when he past away.He took with him a [YONDAN]-4th Degree. His Sensei came from Okinawian am not shore how old he was when he died but he took with him[GODAN]-5th Degree.Am 42yrs old and I hold [NIDAN]-2Dedree.Just do some homework, over in Okinawian and Japan the Sensei's and Masters are 4th-8th and thats a life time to get. 9th or even 10th is like being a king.Not in the US.We probly have one in every Dojo."
2,George Alexander,The tape is informative to someone who knows little about shorin ryu. However it fails in the sense that Mr Alexander has poor kata resembling that of a yellow belt.
2,"Go Nagai, WHY!?","Let me start out by saying I LOVE GO NAGAI! I can't believe this anime came from the same guy that created Demon Lord Dante, Devil Man, and Black Lion as well as other classics of anime. As much as it hurts me to say this, Kekko Kamen is bad. To say that the animation is sub-standard is being very nice. Then there's the story. I'm going to cry. Please don't hate me Go Nagai (and please don't ever do this to your loyal fans again)."
4,I like it!!,"If you like W.A.S.P.?, add this one to your collection. It's dark, it's mad, it's melodic, it's rock & roll, it's W.A.S.P.BUT IT!!"
4,wasp heavy metal,this item came in a timely manner and came as described . this was another one i did'nt realize they had out . it was an ok album . had to purchase this one to go with the ones i already had .
4,Good bye Mr. Holms.,"This is Blackie and the boys' finest hour; finest hour sans Chris Holmes that is. Anyone who's heard Still Not Black Enough can attest to the auditory anguish of a W.A.S.P. album absent of booze guzzling mogul and lead guitarist Chris Holmes. Dying for the World is nothing new. It treads no uncharted waters and falls more in the vein of The Headless Children than their much touted comeback album Helldorado. The songs are dark and the overall tone is of horror and despair. All in all there's not a stinker present, even the mellower Hallowed Ground that addresses the issues and tragedies of September 11th holds up rather well. Alleged rocker Bruce Springsteen was given awards for this opportunistic approach, as was Kentucky fried Country picker Alan Jackson. W.A.S.P. cancelled their North American tour.By: Christopher Curry"
4,Continues on the same path as Unholy Terror,"WASP have a new guitarist on this album, after long term guitarist CHris Holmes left after the recording of Unholy Terror. The new guitarist is technically better and the solos are slightly better on this album. the songs are pretty good with a few duds but thas ok coz wasp makes up for it with blinding tracks like Shadow Man and Hell for Eternity!! i cant wait to see wasp on tour, they sound so energised on this album:)Overall, good stuff."
3,"Good, but not great.","Better than Helldorado, but still not as good as Crimson Idol, Headless Children and the first album. In fact it rips off some of Crimson on ""Hollowed Ground"" which is not a good thing. Back to the drawing board Blackie."
4,The Greatest Coach Ever,"Vince Lombardi was a real hero of mine. I don't know why, I was a child of the 60's and he stood for many things I was against, but he struck a chord with me and I literally loved the man and am a life-long Packer fan as a result.This is a good book. I get tired of the authors continued resurrection of Lombardi's weaknesses and his wife's need for alcohol. Once is OK, but after every Lombardi victory, the author is compelled to resurrect Lombardi's sad family life. It might be true, but I don't need to re-read about it in every chapter."
5,A True Story Of Life & Sport...,"What a great read. Although the first part of the book will challenge those unfamiliar with Vincent T. Lombardi's legacy from an historical perspective, the bulk of the book will challenge your sleep patterns! As a Wisconsin native, I remember many trips to Green Bay during the '60s with my Dad, hearing my father wax poetic about Lombardi. This wonderful chronology of Lombardi will teach as well as endear its readers to the ""man, myth and legend"". Great job Mr. Maraniss or, can I call you David?"
5,A great American bio.,"This biography is one the best books I've read in a long time. I think it will be the definative biography on the imcomparable Lombardi, whose brilliance as a gridiron pedagogue, whose complexity and contradictions, are all well delineated in wonderfully written and researched book. This book would make a great present for any persons interested in football history or a life of a passionate, hard working American."
5,Quite simply one of the best books that I have ever read,"This biography of Vince Lombardi is so captivating and so well written that I am reading it for the third time, and I never tire of it. The book flows almost like a novel, yet it is a true story. Particularly appealling to me is the build-up to the early years in Green Bay: From the chapter ""The Foreigner"" to those describing the tremendous success of the first few teams through 1962.I highly recommend this book to anyone who is nostalgic for the days ""when pride still mattterd"". I certainly wish that some of today's tattoed, body pierced, chain smoking twenty somethings would read it."
5,Outstanding,"Maraniss's work accurately shows that our heroes have warts. His book is a constant study of myth vs. reality. Living in Wisconsin, the myth of Lombardi often outweighs the reality. Even after peeling back the layers, he's still the most dominant figure of his era in his sport. But, not even Lombardi was perfect."
2,Way too much info,"I love sports biographies, especially about coaches. Woody Hayes, Bear Bryant, Knute Rockne... I have read a bunch. I like them to be sort of an extra long Sports Illustrated article, a nice recap of their life, career, and personality, or what made them the leaders they were. I don't need an entire chapter on a Friar's Club meeting, or whatever it was where they had a post season banquet. I don't need fight songs, especially unknown or unimportant ones printed out. This book sometimes spent 5 pages detailing something that needed only one page to describe. At points, it was painful to read. I just think he was the wrong writer for the subject matter: not that he wrote in a way I could not understand, but I've read more interesting math textbooks in my life."
5,Kudos to the author for a great book about a great man,"True greatness is not seen in all the glitter that goes with success. It is seen in the daily toil and struggle against whatever life throws at you. This book shows that Vince Lombardi was not perfect, his marriage was not rosy, and by his own admission he was not the father he should have been. Yet the book also shows that despite it all, Vince Lombardi fought against the odds, and mostly fought against himself, and he won. Vince Lombardi died at the right time, as the football world he knew, without big business and million dollar salaries, was crumbling all around him. His values are those of the shining knights of old, who stood for sacrifice of the individual for the benefit of the common good. This book does him justice, and it moved me to tears even as I read over snippets of it in the bookstore. This is why I bought the book."
4,"Great book, maybe a little long......","This is the complete Vince Lombardi book. The author has left no stone unturned it seems and goes into great depth in looking at what made Lombardi tick.It is not a shrine to the greatness of Lombardi book, the author does write about the Coach's flaws (lack of attention to family) but it is so engrossing that I was upset when the final chapters on Lombardi's death were being read.Maybe the book is a smidgen too long, there were times that it seemed to drag a little but all in all, a great book."
2,Where's the football?,"As a long-time Green Bay Packer fan, I was eager to read this book, but I found it very disappointing. The account of Lombardi's early years is pretty good, because I didn't know much about that period in his life. However, Maraniss doesn't seem to know very much football and, as a result, he virtually ignores Lombardi's contributions to the sport, particularly on the offensive side of the ball. That's odd, because he does make the point that Lombardi was an outstanding X's and O's coach, who often stayed up all night designing a play until it felt right. Yet Maraniss offers practically no information on how Lombardi approached a game, developed a game plan, or designed plays to work against a specific opponent. That's rather like writing a biography of Einstein without talking about physics or mathematics."
4,More Than Just a Football Coach...,"You will not be bored with this one. David Maraniss does an excellent job of uncovering the private side of Lombardi. And what a complex character he was. An ultra-conservative who attended mass daily, Lombardi was not exempt from being surrounded by controversy throughout his life. He had an alcoholic wife, a son he rarely connected with, and a daughter who became pregnant out of wedlock (a big thing back in the 1960s!). In addition, his brother was gay and his father-in-law left his wife to go off with the wife's sister... There's plenty of football as well. The ""Ice Bowl"" against Dallas was a particularly interesting part of the story... Maraniss makes you feel like you're actually at the basement ""socials"" Lombardi would host on Sunday nights after each home game. Well done."
5,Highly Recommended,"An amazing book. I'm not interested in biographies that provide accurate, detailed and extensive information about the subject without putting everything together in a well-written finished product -- this book told a great story. It was fun to read and I was disappointed when it was over.Vince Lombardi was an amazing man on many different levels, but he was also human and I felt like I had gotten to know him by the end of the book. I knew how the book had to end but I still cried when I read about his death. An excellent read!"
5,Read this book!,"Samantha and Richard meet in a unusual way. On New Years Eve Samantha was running out of church to get her purse when she ran into Richard as he was entering the church. Both of them lost their balance, and fell down the steps. When Richard went to the doctor they told him that he broke his foot. Samantha owns a candy shop, and had a room for rent, and Richard needed a place to stay. Samantha rented her room to Richard and they became good friends. Samantha's biseness was in danger. She knew that there was a new mall going in down the street, but she did not know that Richard was the owner of it. Will Samantha and Richard's friendship be reined by the mall?"
1,Expired early,"While the product seemed fine, I am new to using it, I would not order it again because it expired before 6 months, which is fast in my opinion. I am not sure if this is typical or not, but not worth it if you wouldn't use it often. The recipe I used it in was not good, but I can't say if the custard could taste good in a different recipe."
4,A Necessary Addition to Your RHS Collection,I rated this recording a four only because of the scarcity of songs. Daniel Abineri is absolutly sensational as Frank-N-Furter. The best since TC. The other performers are great as well. This CD is well worth the price.
1,Total Junk!,"This was a present from Santa and let me tell you how difficult it was for me to explain why the elves made a backpack that would fall apart so easily. This was rendered useless after 3 weeks worth of normal Kindergarten use. The handle broke, one wheel cracked, the seems began to rip, and holes immediately began to form with use. Waste of money."
3,Silicone pot holders,"I am expecting these to perform as well as other silicone products. I only gave it 3 stars because when you see the color in the on line picture, which is a much softer green BUT when you get the actual product, they are really, really green. I would have preferred the color that was in the picture. Perhaps Amazon could update picture to show a more true color, that way people would know what they actually look like (color wise). Had I seen the actual color, I probably would not have ordered them as they are just too green for me. I have decided they should be returned because of this misrepresentation of the color."
2,Silicone Potholder,I found the silicone pothold to be too stiff. Not flexable enough to hold a hot item in your hand with it. Would be O.K. for a hot pad. Do not recommend and will not buy again.
2,Hard to handle,"After a lifetime of using your basic cloth potholders, the concept of silicone sounded good so I gave them a try. Really, I wanted to like them but they're so awkward... always felt like they would slip and I'd get burned. So now I just use folded up kitchen towels."
1,Wrong color,"For all of you who wanted dark green and got pale sage, I received the dark green! Unfortunately, I actually wanted the pale sage green, so back they went. The photo currently is of the pale green version, but that is not what I got.It's too bad that the manufacturers don't differentiate between the various colors that might be offered. Just being marked ""green"" on the package can mean any shade and seems to be the problem.I was really looking forward to replacing my old cloth pot holders, but I'll have to wait."
1,Color is way off....,"Per the photo I was expecting hunter or forrest green. The color is a pale ugly yellowish green. I haven't used them so I can't comment on use, as I plan to donate them to Goodwill. I doubt any of the colors except maybe black will be accurate."
2,Disappointing,"Joyce Meyer has ""grown"" her message since this book was written, and I found these meditations a bit simplistic. It just seemed very out of date."
5,My favorite book to end a day with.,"Item was in excellent condition and arrived quickly - great service. I have given this evening devotional to a number of friends and recommend it as it's a very soothing and comforting devotional and written in a practical and easy ""read""."
5,A Great Way To End Your Day !!!,Highly recommended. I read this every night to my wife and it never ceases to amaze me of how this nightly word closes our day and prepares s for the next. This is the second copy I have purchased... it went to my daughter. Now she has a reason to call me most every day! :o)
4,Ending Your Day Right,I really only have a comment. The book is great but I am disappointed it does not have an index where if you need a certain topic you can read that particular day. This is the first devotional or daily reader that I have that does not include the index. I have Starting Your Day Right and it is the same way.
5,Beautiful!,"Picked up this book in Istanbul. It is beautifully written and I could not put it down. It is a little sad and very thought provoking. The information added by the writer's son at the end of the book helped to create the complete picture. Must read, despite the high price of the book."
4,HOMESPUN URBAN FOLK,"Odd music that is both irritating and enchanting. ""D TRAIN"" reminds me of Chicago's EL, and Pilly's subway. Peter, Paul, and Mary meet Tom Petty? Choose for yourself."
4,Great Pack,This is a great pack for day trips but is not 100% identical to the one the military issues. This pack is missing the velcro flap that allows for a cingar radio antenna to stick out of the pack. However sense most of us are lucky enough to not be stuck with that piece of equipment it will not be missed. My paintball team use this pack to haul around spare paint and air tanks and it is very handy in that regard.
5,An Absolute Must See!!,"This is a heartwarming love story that proves how being true to yourself is always the right thing to do. It also shows that being kind to others is never wasted effort. The good you do usually comes back to you. This story takes you on a rollercoaster ride through the world of politics, the good, the bad, and the ugly of it. The main characters had excellent chemistry and they left you wanting more. You will definitely not regret watching this one."
4,"Great Politics, Okay Romance","I bought City Hall because I love the actress from My Lovely Sam-Soon. City Hall is totally different from My Lovely Sam-Soon. It has a pretty intricate political plot that definitely held my attention more than the romance. I couldn't really feel the chemistry between the two main characters. However, the glimpse (dramatized of course) into local Korean politics was fascinating. I was surprised several times by plot twists, which is somewhat unusual for a kdrama. It was also hilarious, more so than Sam-soon."
2,"Shallow engraving, difficult to work","Bought because of the cheap price, but I got what I paid for. The stamp head is small, and the letter engraving is very shallow, meaning the 'B' that gets stamped into the wax is very thin and difficult to see. Sealing wax also sticks to the thin circular ridge around the edge of the stamp, leaving jagged edges. Not as classy of a look as I wanted."
1,Beware! This is one bone. One only. $39.25 for one bone?,"Beware! This is one bone. One only. $39.25 for one bone? I'm at fault I guess. It says one bone, but I thought I was buying a pack. Who would have guessed that anyone would sell one bone for 39.25 - But they really *are* only selling one bone."
3,"Okay Book, but very general","The book was definitely geared toward the partying-set, and was very vague in descriptions of the various neighborhoods of London or in finding a job. The review of neighborhoods was so cursory that all the descriptions eventually sounded the same and they missed a few as well.There really wasn't anything in there that I didn't already know, although it might be a little helpful for someone moving to London, but it's all information you could find on the web or from a friend."
1,Relocating family to London,"This book is for young partiers traveling and living in London. If you have a family and are looking to relocate or travel to London, skip this book. It is light on details and long on weak humor and party locales."
5,help I want to move to London.,"This book is fantastic if you have decided to move to London on a whim and lack the support structure of either a company or study abroad program to help you through the transition. It gives you all the details about how to go about putting together a life having stepped off a plane with only a suitcase, finding a place to sleep immediately and in the long term, a job, etc. It also allowed me to do a lot of the research and legwork before I arrived for example pick a cellphone company and plan when I didn't even know which cellphone companies there were in the U.K. prior to reading it. It really IS the London Bible."
4,lava lamp,Bought this as a lark. Fun and cute. it burnt out in 30 days and the cord from the USB to unit was a bit short.It was fun and for the cost hey it was worth it
2,I would not buy it again.,"If you buy this camera, remember to buy also additional DVD copy software (IntelVideo Copy - around $70), plus only Panasonic DVD-Ram mini DVD disks (also expensive). Also, after my experience, if you erase one DVD-ram disc at least twice, on the third use the movie will have many video or audio problems. Not knowing this problem, I ruined my friend's baby shower video. Panasonic customer service is not helpful at all. A representative was even surprised that my camera does not have USB cable!!! Other then that - let's say, once you cannot return this camera to the store, because I opened it and used it, you can still enjoy lightness of the camera. One more thing: you need to purchase the light also; this camera does not have built-in light - you will need it. ... So, how much does the camera cost after all???"
2,"No USB Port, does not use DVD-RW that is compatible with most drives and dvd players","Has good features, but the biggest downsides are it does not have a USB port and it uses DVD-RAM discs (re-writable) which do not work on most of the DVD players.Note that it does not use DVD-RW discs that come with most notebooks and desktop computers and allow re-writing.So there seems to be virtually no way to transfer your videos to your computer, other than buying a DVD Multi drive that can read DVD-RAM discs."
3,tommy comforter,It is just OK not really like what the picture shows. Got it for my oldest sons bedroom. Knowing what I know now I would have chosen something different. Its ok.
5,Great Gift Idea,I purchased this as a gift for my husband. He has always wanted a corvette! Now he has one! Very pleased with the purchase and my husband got a kick out of it.
2,Pretty Sloppy Paint Job,"Received this as a Christmas gift. I am a Corvette owner and admirer. The painting looked like some little, little child did it. I was very disappointed. I would return it but it was a gift. I can hide it in the back of the Christmas tree."
4,"Poor paint job, but beautiful nonetheless.","I bought this for my dad for Christmas. I was disappointed in the quality of the hand-painted exterior, but it is still beautiful nonetheless. This ornament arrived in a plastic box with GM logos. No mention of Corvette to be found on the packaging, but the license plate does read 1957. This is not a negative to me however since this ornament will be placed on his tree."
2,Rent the DVD instead,"I'm a Margaret Cho fan, but I don't recommend buying this CD. I bought it but then decided to rent the DVD of her Notorious C.H.O. tour. I haven't listened to the CD since. So much of her humor is seeing the faces she makes as she tells stories, and all of that, of course, is lost on the CD."
5,More Than Just Margaret,"This CD is an excellent addition to anyone's collection. I remember first spotting Margaret Cho on her short-lived sitcom ""All American Girl."" She is a beautiful, talented, and incredibly funny woman. This girl isn't your average stand-up gig. Margaret bursts out with stories that put you on the edge of your seat with tears in your eyes until you fall to the ground laughing. Her life has been one tremendous obstacle and she's made it all the way to Carnegie Hall. The CD starts with some new material about her travels in Scotland but later delves into the stories we know and love about her mother and gay males friends. My personal favourite would have to be the story of ""Alan and Jeremy"" her two drag-queen friends from highschool who got into fights everyday; ... If you've ever felt like the world has let you down or that you just don't fit in, then this CD is for you. It will raise your hopes and the corners of your mouth."
5,Expert Advice,"Anyone who is at all familiar with forensic psychology knows and appreciates the work of Dr.Brodsky. This text continues the long tradition of contributions to the field by Dr. Brodsky. This book, as is his ususal style, is clearly written, to the point, pragmatic and above all helpful. It contains specific strategies and guidelines that are essential to the newcomer to testifying in court. These strategies, as well, are important guides for those who have experience testifying. I have used his strategies, both from this text and the one preceeding and have found them to be on target, useful and highly effective. One should not venture into the courtroom without having had the benefit of this work."
4,"practical, helpful and entertaining!!!","an enjoyable, entertaining read. very useful content. brodsky cuts to the chase. he doesn't provide much detail regarding legal background, rules of evidence, criminal procedure, etc. in this book. he provides the essential information for the mental health professional to survive and be successful in direct and cross-examination. i believe it is worthwhile reading. for the alleviated fears, improved performance, and reduced potential embarrassing moments on the stand, it is certainly worth $13."
4,Cake Storage,"I loved the vintage look of this tin on-screen, but was a little annoyed at the price so I purchased only one. (Understand that I was originally searching for a tin to ship cakes for the holidays to family and friends, but at these prices I would be broke after a few containers. I looked further for my shipping needs.)When I examined my purchase, upon receipt, the sturdy quality was totally unexpected. I was so impressed with the look and quality of this item that the price was no longer an issue. These tins are truly built for storage and tall enough for a 3-layer cake. They make excellent gift ideas (with a cake inside), for those persons who really appreciate the vintage look and feel that is missed in many reproductions today; or would be a great decorative piece to accent a retro kitchen. I am very pleased with my purchase."
2,Not Happy,When I received this and the Adventure Game there was NO shipping label. Nothing to tell cost or a return label. The cake pan was in an old plastic bag that looked ruff. The game seems to be ok. I don't like to review orders but I think you should know about these problems. Thank you Daisy
5,easy to install!,"My husband and I installed this for my mom on her new Tacoma in less than 30 minutes - it only took that long because our 4 month old was not being supportive of our endeavor! This brand has the best reviews across the internet, so I imagine it will hold up."
2,Dissapointed,One of the photographs of this product shows that there is a ball mount included with the receiver. The description says that the ball is not included but does not mention the ball mount which I expected to be in the box. I opened it today and there was no ball mount there. I could have bought this for $17 less on ebay and would have done so if I'd known that the product was not as presented in the photograph.
5,Great Product,This hitch fit great. Required no modification to anything.It is built strong with a nice powdercoat finish. Easy install with hand tools took about 45 minutes. My only recommendation is to have a second person help you realign the bumper.
5,great book,my kindergardner loved this book (and other books by Lobel); he read them by himself and enjoyed very much .
4,Back in Print,This game is back in print with a new edition from editor John Curry and the History of Wargaming Project.Fletcher Pratt'S Naval Wargame Wargaming With Model Ships 1900-1945http://www.amazon.com/Fletcher-PrattS-Wargame-Wargaming-1900-1945/dp/1447518551
2,No advance in the dialogue. . .,"I was looking forward to reading this book because of its topic and the various aspects covered - as well as the author's reputation. However, I was disappointed. First of all, the tone struck me as hostile. It's almost as if O'Murchu were baiting the Vatican to censure him. If that's too harsh, maybe he is simply engaging in catharsis because of the admittedly difficult positions espoused by the Church throughout the centuries. Anyway, the other thing is that he didn't seem to break any new ground. The book was mostly analysis, with little (as far as I could see) recommendation for positive action. Also, it had been done before. Patriarchy has been appropriately bashed already. I had hoped for something that could be seen as the next step. But that seems impossible, since all the institutions we know are bankrupt and half the human race (the male half) along with it."
3,Campy musical lives again on cd!!,"First off, to all you LOST HORIZON (1973)lovers, I have this movie on laser disk and can make copies if you respond to my e-mail address. The score on CD sounds better than it did over 20 years ago. The movie was a campy, misguided, cheesy mess. Despite a big budget, it still managed to look cheap. The sets were recycled from CAMELOT. The Bachrach songs are so ""up lifting"" they either give you a headache or cause you to sing along in silly joy. Only Bobby Van and Sally Kellerman do thier own vocals and walk away with any class. You should all see Frank Capra's classic original version of this movie released in 1937 (without songs), but most of you ""70s"" folks would probably dislike a B&W movie."
5,An all time favorite assembly of music scores,Ever since seeing this movie in 1973 I have loved this music and compare it to that of Leslie Bricuse and other musical genius'. I highly recommend this soundtrack and movie.
5,Just good memories,I don't care if it's good or bad. I saw the picture again when I've become an adult and regret that. I should have left that in the past... But the songs are great and bring good thoughts of my childhood.
4,many outside the u.s. enjoyed the movie,"when the movie came out in the philippines in 1973, the ""movie-in-the-making"" special was replayed many times on afternoon tv. it showed the fifth dimension performing ""living together,"" as well as burt bacharach conducting the orchestra, performing the title theme.wish that ""special"" is available on dvd, it is as memorable---probably even more---than the movie.the fifth dimension also performed songs not in the movie, such as the spiritual ""nobody knows the trouble i've seen.""many outside the u.s. enjoyed the movie, as can be seen in the many customer's reviews.at that time, at a young age, i couldn't understand why it was a flop in the u.s., when it created a lot of buzz in this part of the world."
3,WORTH A LISTEN,"A major fan of Burt Bacharach, I was exploding with anticipation to see this film in 1973, which proved to be one of the biggest box-office disappointments of all time. The film, in my opinion, is virtually without merit, and I saw the ORIGINAL version complete with men in bikinis doing some kind of tribal sex-dance to an extended bridge of LIVING TOGETHER. The album is definitely worth listening to, if not owning, as a part of Bacharach's extraordinary catalog of music. There are some trademark melodies and some exciting rhythmic ideas here, but it for the most part a misguided effort. Still, I love the opening song, and REFLECTIONS (Sally Kellerman). Burt himself does these songs much greater justice on his own album LIVING TOGETHER, which appeared approxiamtely a year after the movie's devastation to his career."
5,1973 Lost Horizon Soundtrack,"My purchase arrived in 3 days! How great is that? The condition of the cd and soundtrack were fantastic! I have been looking for this cd for quite some time and was very pleased to see that Amazon had it! I had heard of bad reviews with Amazon's service a few years back so hadn't tried your services. Obviously, things are lots better. I will be visiting your website in the future. Keep up the good work. P.S. If you are a Burt Bacharach fan, you must get this cd. It is simply marvelous ! ! ! :)"
5,ditto ditto ditto,"Thank you - all who have reviewed this. I can't add anything new to what has already been stated. I've been checking for a video tape of Lost Horizon for several years now - and will have to be satisfied with the CD until that wonderful day comes. Burt Bacharach has been my favorite since singing ""The Windows of the World"" in the early 70's while attending NYState Music Camp in Oneonta, NY while singing in the ""Select Choir."" What a talented composer and of course Hal David's inspiring words. Same for all the songs in this collection."
2,Much too short,"That great theme song I like to hum again, ""There is a lost horizon, where the sun goes down.."" I blinked and the song ended! Each song could not have been more than a minute longer than your song sample menu! Great music, but each number seemed to be cut too short."
5,LURVE LURVE LURVE,"I lurve this album. I bawl the songs loudly and tunelessly in the shower. I think of them all the time when I can't bawl (e.g. in public). Yes I only just got my copy, but these tunes are classic in the sense that we all know them except we can't remember where they came from. The lyrics are worth listening too - deep and meaningful. Maan. Brilliant."
3,Starts Great...then falls apart,"Leonard Maltin said it best:The first 1/2 hour is terrific and THEN...the movie turns into a gooey musical.Some of the songs are quite tuneful with very complex melodies and rhythms...but those LYRICS ???? Not exactly Hal David's best work, apparently he and Burt Bacharach didn't quite mesh on this one.The singers should have been dubbed although Sally Kellerman isn't half bad on ""Things I Will Not Miss"" but blows it on ""Reflections."" (Not her fault.)Then, the last 1/2 hour seems rushed and while the ending works...it lacks the emotional punch needed to put it over.Anyway, a lot to like, but a lot of ""what WERE they thinking?""3-Stars may seem high, but looking back as a curio item, it is warranted...but you were warned (John Gielgud as an Asian???)"
3,Tip for Bacharach fans,"I do prefer, largerly, the orchestrated+choral Bacharach versions, of ""Lost Horizon"", ""I might have frighten her away"" and ""Reflections"" which, unfortunately, are NOT available on CDs, they are only in a vinyl '70ies album.These other versions really have the Bacharach style in it best inspiration and expression."
4,Excellent,"I have not seen this film, but its soundtrack is one of my recent vinyl grabs. I am always sniffing the crates for fresh Bacharach, and Lost Horizon is a winner.This came in 1973, and while the songs here are 100% Burt, his chord structures and arrangements seem more complex and savory than in his 1960s work.Lost Horizon has a large cast, and Bacharach takes advantage, using amazing harmonies, that twist beautifully in cadences that could only be his. His orchestrations--hey, its Burt-are as tasteful as to be his signature.Brilliant"
3,Contrived and reminiscent of the Covington series,"In the Covington series, there are three ladies who live together. In ""The Three Mrs. Parkers"" there are 3 generations of ladies living together. They both take place in the Carolinas and the women all begin with problems from their past which seem to quickly disappear as the books progress. The women in both books like to entertain their neighbors who are close and supportive. This book has a theme of forgiveness, but at times it seems that forgiveness comes too easily after being held onto for many years. There is also an overly-dramatic scene of violence which doesn't seem to have a logical motive. The oldest Mrs. Parker seems to have a change of personality that is sudden and unexplained. Diehard Joan Medlicott fans will still probably enjoy this book."
2,Who Wrote This Novel?,While the novel was just 'ok'; I have to ask: Who was the author? This book was not Joan Medlicott's style of writing. I was disappointed and glad I hadn't paid for the book but instead found it at the library.
3,Readable,"This is not normally my kind of book, but having just readBroken Prey, needed a change of pace. This book is ok, howeverthere are not 3 Mrs. Parkers. Two and one Ms or Miss Parker.Also it's nuts that one could not pay off a $39,000 loan on50 acres of land. Zoe could have worked at a fast food placeand made enough for the payments, even if she had bad credit.She evidently had enought money for satellite tv as she turnedon CNN, but hey, you got to have a story. If you like books about feelings and forgiveness, etc you probably would like this.I'm going back to my type of book and will start The Closers."
5,good investment,I bought htis book and i thouught it was great. Plus it has a moneyback guarantee if you are not happy. It is better than most of the other books. I have a feeling the negative reviews were written by people who didnt read this bool or people with an ax to grind. -- :)
1,Not very helpful! Too much general information.,"I purchased this book along with several others in order to get assistance in gaining and passing pharmaceutical sales interviews. It promises much but delivers very little.The questions and answers were very general in nature and too much emphasis was given to ""how to dress"" and creating an attractive resume. I think I can manage those areas especially since that information is easily available over the Internet. It was definitely not worth the price!"
5,"L'Arc~en~ciel's ""Clicked Singles Best 13"" Rules!","If you have always wanted to buy a JROCK album, but were afraid to because of the high cost of imports, well ""Clicked Singles Best 13"" is priced just right! This is Larku's first official US release! The biggest bonus this album has to offer is the fact that all of the tracks are great, I love each and every one of them. My personal favorite track is ""Blurry Eyes"", this is the first Larku single I had ever listened to, and I have been a fan ever since. This album is special because the tracks were selected by Internet users, like me and you. If you love JROCK, I am sure you will love Larku's ""Clicked Singles Best 13""."
2,"""Anemone"" is the only reason to buy this.","I can't think of any reason to buy this album except for ""Anemone"", a gorgeous song composed by hyde.People say this is a good introduction to the band but it's not. Not at all. Their first three albums are represented in only 1 song, ""Blurry Eyes"", and it's not even a good representative. You can't sum up the band's work in just 12 songs no matter what ones you pick.If you want an introduction to L'Arc~en~Ciel, buy their albums. It's the only way. Each album is so unique, each album is its own experience, and you can't understand L'Arc without hearing them all.So, to reiterate, buy this album because ""Anemone"" is a really great song. But otherwise it's just a collection of some of the band's songs."
4,It is a great argument the one proposed,"what a great book I have just read. it wanders across the problem of poverty in the capitalist empire. it uses true examples for consolidating his argument and explains the alternative solution to this problem that seems a problem more from people of all classes rather than the ""underclass"".it produced some sparks on the eagerness to learn more humanities and escape from the ""surround of force"" which most of us are influenced with.I have really loved this book a lot and I hope some more can have the same experience i had in this eye-opener proposal that explicitly is aimed at the poor class, but affects the whole society."
1,Just awful...,"I thought that buying this little vac was going to be a good investment with my new cats. Nope. It was a huge disappointment, especially for the price. The filter becomes clogged with dust within a few minutes of use, and suction goes down to nothing. There's no bag to change, so you're forced to shake the filter out or wash it. Theoretically, I suppose it could be used to vacuum up bigger, solid particles that won't clog a paper filter (e.g., sand?). But if you have a normal house with dust or hair, this little vac is not for you."
3,great for small areas but not a replacement for a real vacuum,Since I move often and have a small apartment I bought this unit after my old vacuum broke down. I was hoping it would be sufficient enough for my apartment. I was wrong!The brush attachment stopped working right away and cleaning didn't help much.Another problem is that the unit has a very small air filter. Even with a new filter the suction power decreases rapidly right away because the filter gets cluttered up.Since the small motor spins at a high RPM the unit is also quite noisy.I only recommend this unit in addition to a real vacuum.
4,Love the Vac - Hate the Floor Attachment,"Love this vac. Good suction. Cleaning the filter is not really a problem; I had used a friend's older version so knew what to expect.HOWEVER, I did not expect the little, beater-brush attachment. Completely useless!!!!!!!!! Looking for a replacement - the regular, flat floor attachment was what I expected and desired."
5,great vac,The Black and Decker Hand Vac is the best vac that I have ever had. With the many attachments I can do anything that I need to do. I have on order another one since November 22 and have been on the waiting list but I intend to give this to my grandson because I know he will like it.
4,Strong Lil Guy,"This vac has been great for my little apartment that can't accomodate a stand-up vac. It has a strong suction that has made other little vacs pale in comparision, plus it's light enough to hold overhead to get cobwebs & ceiling fans.I agree with the other reviews about the beater brush attachment, it's not so great."
2,filter clogs almost constantly,"This hand vac is an attractive desgn, with a long cord, nice acessories and it can even be used as an inflator for low-pressure inflatables like air matresses, dinghys, beach balls, etc. And yes, its way more powerful than a cordless vac. But as other reviewers have pointed out, it's not designed to be used as a main vacuum cleaner, only as a supplement for smaller jobs.But the problem is that the filter is a poor design ; it's small and clogs after every few minutes of use, even when only used for light cleaning & dusting jobs. And cleaning the dust out of the pleated filter is not an easy task. Another smaller annoyance is that if you want to use your nozzles from your other vacuum cleaner(s) you already own, you must use the included, short flexible hose as an adapter because they won't attach directly. But I often like to use the short hose anyway, for the greater flexibility and reach it gives."
1,A rewrite of press releases and newspaper articles,I was privy to this story and the book is nothing more than a quick rewrite of police press releases and local nrewspaper articles. For shame!
4,womack is great especially that's the way I feel about cha,"As time went by, I often wondered how I may obtain Bobby Womacks hits, thank goodness for AMAZON!"
4,Useful,"Is great for people learning English grammar. Has tips and very good examples, so you now when and how to use periods, commas, semmi colons, etc"
4,bushnell,A very good binoculars. Nice view and bight. But it is heavier and bigger than I thought before I bought it.
4,Bushnell NatureView 8x42,Excellent value. These are the best binoculars I have ever used for under $200. The are easy to use and the image quality is crisp and clear. They are a little bulky for small children.
4,it is really good!,It is a nice Roof Prism Binocular no matter the quality or the outward appearance!I really love it!Good choice!
5,"Compact, with a clear image","Purchased for a trip to Yellowstone, these binoculars are the perfect balance between lightweight portability, magnification, and clarity of image. Thorougly recommended for general bird and wildlife watching."
2,Guaranteed Kinkless -- ha ha,"I should have known that no hose made by man can be guaranteed not to kink, and this one is no exception. Shame that there is No Truth In Advertising!"
2,"Should be ""Everkink""","I purchased this hose based upon it's claim to ""Neverkink"". Not sure why they make this claim. Don't see any difference between your average cheap hose and this one. It does kink and I have retired it to the storage shed for use when I need extra hoses. Don't waste your money."
3,Somewhat Dissapointing,"Overall, I was disappointed with the content presented in the book and here's why: the description of this book said ""leads readers step-by-step through 50 innovative, affordable tactics to generate sales.""To me, this book provided a nice overview of each of these tactics, but did not explain how to use each of them step-by-step. I know what email marketing and direct mail are ... how do I actually apply these tactics to my business though? This is what I what looking for out of the book, and it didn't deliver.The content seemed a bit outdated to me as well. For example, the email marketing section talked about Overture, which hasn't been in the picture for years.Granted, if you have no background in marketing, then this book provides a nice overview of ""Marketing 101"" tactics. But to someone who already has a solid understanding of basic marketing principles, and is looking for advice on applying different marketing tactics, I would say look elsewhere."
4,Very practical advice,"This book gives very good practical advice for marketing on a budget. Sice it gives you 50 different tips, there is something usefull in there for every small business."
1,Destroyed several CDs,"This thing does not work. I could never get it to play more than one CD before it jammed. It seems to just toss CDs around inside. I never could figure out what the problem was, but it scratched several of my CDs to the point that they were unplayable. Avoid this!"
1,How dare you!,"I was very excited about storing my CD's. When I opened the box there was alot of popcorn and when I took out the MegaStorage the door fell off, there were no cords. I used one of mine and it did not even come on. A waste."
4,Mixed Feelings,"As always Satriani is awesome live. My complaints with this set are the same as everyone's, the track listing. Aside from the tracks which were on ""Super Colossal"", the other songs are on other live cd's. I would've liked to have heard ""War"", ""Back To Shalla-Bal"", any number of songs from ""Is There Love In Space?""...some live stuff not previously available, basically. Again though, Satriani is always great live.If you have no live cd's of Joe's or are a big fan of ""Super Colossal"", this is a great cd for you. I also noticed that the track listing on the cd is wrong. Tracks 1 & 3 are reversed. The opening track is ""Redshift Riders"" and track #3 is ""Flying In A Blue Dream""...true fans notice these things."
1,Same songs again!,"Sadly, Satch's rich repertoire remains obscure in live releases. The first time you heard ""Flying in a Blue Dream"", ""Summer Song"", ""Cool # 9"", or ""Satch Boogie"" live you may have been knocked off. But to hear these songs over and over again is not worth the 20 dollars spent to listen a handful of Super Colossal songs performed live. Although Dave LaRue's peculiar style gives this CD an agreeable taste (specially on ""Circles""), and Super Colossal's ""Made of Tears"", ""Crowd Chant"", ""Ten Words"", etc., are played rather nicely, many of us Satch fans would rather hear Time Machine or Strange Beautiful Music tracks. And for the love of God, stop mixing Galen Henson's rhythm guitars out!"
5,Another winner,"My only gripe of the live records in Satch's catalog is he always includes the ""hits"" so you tend to get the same batch of songs. That being said, this one is still a winner."
5,desperately seeking an 8,"love this boot.have all three colors, but i wore out the black pair.have been trying to find the black in an 8.comfortable fit, looks nice with boots, slacks or dressesmy favorite of all time."
3,too long in the toe,i love the boots the deatil is great but they are very long in the toe too long for me i will send them back
2,BEAUTIFUL BUT SHORT,"THESE BOOTS ARE VERY DETAILED. THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL. HOWEVER, THE LENGTH IS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED. THEY ARE TOO SHORT TO BE COWBOY BOOTS. I WOULD ONLY BUY THEM IF THEY WERE TALLER."
5,"Exquisite, Surreal Imagery, a New Benchmark in Presentation","I have collected many works in the genre over the years. This particular one by Fortney I find especially compelling. I gasped in abject wonder at the first facing photograph when turning the page following the author's introduction. Extraordinary imagery. Captivating perspectives, rich in composition. Handsomely reproduced so the printing effectively achieves resonance. Definitely one for the coffee table. If you've had the opportunity to drink in aerial vantage points when flying commercial airliners, you will be in for a treat because of the immediacy inherent within most shots. Thoughtful commentary into the context of certain photographs enhances the overall appreciation for what ultimately contributed to the finished product. I truly hope more works of this stunning artform emerge. What's next, Mr. Fortney?"
5,Low Level Photography - An Adventure,This is the first of two similar books by the same author. It has remarkable photographs and an excellent adventure story. I am thinking about purchasing a second copy so I can dismantle it and frame some of the photographs for enjoyment by anyone who enjoys good photography. I particularly like the format and the fact that it contains the photograph on a single page rather than following the practice of other books spreading a photograph over two adjoining pages.This an excellent coffee table book for any waiting room where persons are impatient. The material is relaxing and the story is pleasant. It is a good adventure with beautiful scenery.
3,good idea but beware teflon grill,"Coleman stoves are functional and durable and a good buy when on sale. Combining a stove and grill is a good idea, but beware because this one comes with a nonstick teflon grill. I don't like any nonstick teflon cookware, but if careful, the optional griddle is okay until it starts to wear. But grills get too hot for teflon. I bought this anyway and purchased a Lodge iron grill to use instead. Nothing lasts longer than cast iron, and you can get one pre-seasoned. Once seasoned, iron works like nonstick without the danger. Both are heavy and only suitable for car camping. But the iron grill can also be used with a campfire or coals."
4,hot stove,"This stove is Hot! The burner is much hotter than the ones in my trailer and will boil water in a heart beat.Two small problems however:Latch is less than optimal, opens easily accidently.grill plate itself is not secure as it has four small posts that must sit on 4 small humps which allow the grill to easily slide around.Despite that it cooks like a charm. I suspect the newer model of this stove has improved as Coleman rarely keeps such obvious design flaws in its products."
5,A Building Culture,"For years, I have been waiting for an honest discussion about the interface between development, design, construction and history. The Culture of Building helps to answer some of those nagging questions of why the built world of America looks the way that it does. Davis skillfully compares the evolution and habits of several building cultures to help illuminate our own. It is an important book for my education as an architect."
4,Why We Build What We Do?,An excellent introduction to why we build the way we do. Davis explains the role of conflicting forces and institutions in shaping the buildings we build. He recommends improvements which our culture and architects needs to make in order to build healthy communities.
2,Piggies! I meant piggies....,"That's the entertaining part of this book, searching for the hidden piggies. Not bunnies, as I mistakenly mentioned earlier. Carry on."
3,Disturbed childrens stories,"Well...my boyfriend bought me this book a while back, Its full of short,sinister,and rather amusing ""nursery rhymes"".Slightly amusing, something I would read to my kids if I ever have any...and there are hidden pics of little pigs on almost every page...so its like a 2 in 1 deal....you get to read Roman Dirge's work and look at his illustrations while searching for piggies.....of course he doesn't tell you there are piggies until the end.....I just told you now.Though I am a bigger fan of Jhonen, I still give this book 3 stars for its short stories,""cute"" rhymes, sinister art, and hidden piggies.Hey, 3 stars is a half more than a half of 5 stars......or something"
5,Ooo!,"Who CAN'T adore anything writeen by Roman Dirge? This book is beautiful! And from the same person who brought us ""the adventures of a cute little dead girl"" Lenore, and who was inspired by (hottoeboy) Jhonen V himself too! wow. If you enjoy this, then check out Squee, and Johnny. you'll adore it. (email me for more rambling =P)"
2,i just dont get it,"I dont understand why people find Roman Dirge funny, or particularly artistically inclined.i picked up dirge's books ONLY bc Vasquez advertised him to the extent that I thought him to be a Vasquez pen name/creation..(Roman Dirge, IS a rather clever pen name) but reading the work and viewing the art proves that this definetly isnt the case.Roman Dirge just lacks as a comic writer all around.i wouldnt spend money on this again, and more I wish I hadnt in the first place."
2,Trying too hard to be funny,"This book is my first experience with Roman Dirge, and it will probably be my last. I collect children's books, mainly off-beat ones, so this book caught my attention. But after reading through it, the only feeling I get from it is something similar to a stand-up comdedian trying his hardest to make people laugh. Do you know what I mean? For some people it just comes naturally to be funny or creepy, but Mr. Dirge is simply trying too hard. The illustrations are ok...just ok. But honestly, I wish I could trade this book in for something by Gris Grimly. The highlight of this book is searching for the hidden bunnies."
3,Nails are fine... delivery by Amazon wasn't,"Amazon is my default place to look for good deals on power tools... competitive prices, good sales, often free shipping. And I've generally had good experiences with items arriving in good condition.These nails were the one exception to that rule. The shipping box looked like it'd been smacked around with a baseball bat, and the internal box the nails were packaged in had ruptured. Most of the nails were still in the box, and most were still usable, but some of the strips (held together by plastic) had been broken into 2 or 3 sub-strips of nails. Not so great.The nails themselves are fine, and work great in my Milwaukee framing nailer. No complaints there.I'll still buy tools from Amazon, but sorry guys, for the rest of my nails, I'm going to Home Depot, Lowes, etc."
4,A little slow in coming but Great condition.,It must have been a hard book to find. Once I finally received it it was in great condtion. I have no complaints. I took off one star because it took so long.
5,Excellent,"I played the GC version of this, and it was excellent (the most fun I had with any GC game yet). My friend and I played this late into the night and it never got dull. Pick it up, especially if you played the 2-d version. I think the 3d version is marginally better then the 2d version, but they are are different then eachother enough to make such a comparision meaningless."
1,no idea but played the older version,"I can't say anthing about this game but I have played the one on computer. It was fun, creative, and pretty destructive for a bunch of worms. There was a huge selection of weapons and a very challenging AI. If this is half as fun as the computer it could be a hell of a time."
4,Hidden secrets,"It's filled with lovely images & the basic steps she uses. You are expected to have knowledge of Painter & Photoshop. What I found lacking was precise details on the retouching with examples of the size brushes she uses & the before and after examples. For instance she has a cottage that she added roses to, but doesn't show you how to do it. She touches up faces to look like a china doll, but not the details of just one stroke or clone. She tells you what she used, not really how. A little disappointing that her best secrets remain secret."
1,Very superficial and boring,"If you want to learn how to take a wedding picture and show the bride and groom in color while keeping everyone else in black-and-white, or if you are interested in composing a collage that has a faded-yet-boring b/w picture of (again) a bride partially covered by three non-faded-yet-still-boring smaller b/w pictures of the same bride - with a drop-shadow (!) - then this book is for you. But if you are looking for anything that even remotely resembles art, if you want any kind of inspiration, if you want to learn anything new - look elsewhere. All you'll get from this book is ""framing techniques for more marketable images"" (quote from the back cover) - not very intriguing indeed."
5,An essential book for extraordinary pictures,Refining photographs in Photoshop and then using them as a canvas in Corel Painter to create a unique artform is the main focal point here. The techniques in doing so are cleverly orchestrated and simplified. There is as much fun using this new found knowledge to transform images as there is in photographing them. Numerous demonstrations of the possibilities afforded by these programs are illustrated. Equipment and software considerations are also outlined. An indispensable book for the subject it covers.
4,Artistic Techniques with Adobe Photoshop and Corel Painter,"I just recently purchased and have not had a change to work with the details in this book yet. I will say that I am impressed with the information provided for working with both of these programs and your photographs. Author covers pallates, hand coloring, posterization, collages, filters, drawings, effects, retouching, etc. This looks to be a good addition whether you are new or experienced."
1,Comments,"I agree with the above comments...all one sees is a black cover. The book looks/sounds interesting, but there is no table of contents or example of what is inside the book. This book needs to present more information if you expect one to buy."
2,Samples can be scary.,"I'm sorry, but some of the samples in this book just scare me. The two zombie children have shown up in my nightmares even. I suppose that some of the techniques will take me in the direction I want to go, but I'm praying that I will have better results than the author.If you are looking for those amazing money making techniques that highend studios are using today, look elsewhere. This is not the book for you and me."
4,A Good Read,"Don't let the subtitle fool you. This book is not just of interest to theatre buffs. The short stories in this book are for the most part quite interesting. Comparing it with Stoker's other collections of short stories I would have to say this one falls in the middle. While it's not as good as ""Dracula's Guest"" it's better then ""Under the Sunset"".The fifteen stories in this collection are:The OccasionA Lesson in PetsCoggins's PropertyThe Slim SyrensA New Departure in ArtMick the DevilIn Fear of DeathAt LastChin MusicA Deputy WaiterWork'usA Corner in DwarfsA Criminal StarA Star TrapA Moon-Light EffectI enjoyed reading this book."
3,Cute little skippyjon,The doll is really cute and has a great facial expression. The only drawback is that it is small. I meant to order the hand puppet. I am going to keep it as I have 3 little Skippyjon fans so we will use it at our next reading.
3,SKIPPYJON JONES,"I thought the Price was a trifle high for the size but the squeal of delight when my grandson opened the gift was priceless. The coordinating books are well written and fun, A great present."
5,my child adores it,my child adores her Skippyjon doll. It is a little smaller than I imagined it would be but it is just fine to my daughter. It is constructed well and looks just like the character in the books.
2,SkippyJon Doll,"I was disappointed with the size of the doll. It is very small and disproportionate. The head is to ""beeg"" for its body! It won't stand up on its own, so he has to stay propped up against something at all times. For $8.00 I expected a little better."
3,Review,Doll not big enough. Needed to be about 1/3 bigger to get a better response by young ones. Everything else was ok.
4,The perfect companion for Jimmyjon Jones fans,"If your child likes the Jimmyjon Jones adventures, he or she will love to have their own Jimmyjon Jones doll to play with while listening to his adventures or afterwards while creating new adventures. His removable mask will allow for different costumes and adventures."
4,My photo op friend,"I got this little toy originally as a silly gift. The original book is so much fun, and having a toy Skippyjon adds to the fun factor. He turned into my photo op pal, though, because he's easy to carry around in my camera bag. Skippyjon went to Disney World and even has his own scrapbook! All the characters we met held SJ in the photos.I like that his cape is removable, and I'm thinking of knitting him a sweater. The mask has velcro on the back, and yet it is NOT removable."
5,"Yeah, for Skippy Jon Jones!!!!","I love this little character, as a librarian and someone who works with children on a regular basis, this little character is one of the best to come for a long time. I wish that I could afford the whole collection. I purchased this little guy, with a sticker book for myself and a book with the toy in a gift set for a mom-to-be. She loved it and so do I."
5,skippito friskito stuffed toy w/ mask and cape,My daughter is in love with this little guy. Her elementary school has adopted him as there mascot with the motto of B.B.D. BE KIND. BE SAFE. DO THE RIGHT THING. The author comes to the school I guess at some time during their years here and I think it is a great thing for kids to look up to something. This little guy can take off his mask and cape and she loves to do that because skippy likes to move it to other places on his body as well. The only drawback I see is that the cape ties could have been a little longer. Otherwise if your child loves the books they will love this little guy. I do not think that the toy needs to be any bigger. This one is bigger than the one that is with the book. Also the one with the book does not have the ability of taking his cape and mask off. I bought that one for my four year old. It is perfect for a child that shouldn't take things off of a small toy.
4,great pickin' and grinnin' music,This is a wonderful disk filled with take-offs on many country classics. I bought it as a joke but soon found myself and my kids learning all of the words so that we could sing along with the hilarioius lyrics. The banjo picking is great. If you have a sence of humor and enjoy hillbilly music....you can't help but love it.
4,Homer & Jethro CD,The CD came within the time allotted and was in perfect condition.Homer and Jethro are an iconic duo whose musical parodies are great fun to listen to.I recommend this seller.
5,they dunnit,The album lives up to its title--and both are true musicians as well as comedians. I recommend this to anyone who still has sense of huma.
4,Weird wacky and catchy,"See my review of the other Homer & Jethro songs, the mandolin playing is tops, something you don't hear much any more !"
4,Reading into your soul,"A wonderful book for devotions, this book reads deep within your own self in a such a way that you would swear the writer knew you and what you needed the moment she wrote it! Each entry is an idea, a theme, or prayer. Sometimes they are presented simply at other times elegantly but at all times in a way that grabs you and teaches you something you need to know, want to know, or already know but needed to be reminded. It's a book to savor and hope it lasts a long time!"
2,Read the book instead!,"I was truly not impressed with this film after reading the epic novel by Victor Hugo. It did not convey the same spirit and ideas that Hugo was trying to portray. The novel is made up of five volumes. Three fourths of this film was spent on the first volume, and Cosette's adult life seemed almost an afterthought. The musical was infinitely better. One positive note -- Liam Neeson's portrayal of Jean Valjean was rather good."
4,camel back dream is exactly that,"I love this item, the style is great and it really kept my drink cold in 100 degree weather!"
3,"Great imagination, but ...","Much of fantasy these days seem to be a rehash of what has gone before - a middle earth setting with good and evil wizards, gifted or clueless apprentices and varying doses of comedy. In this regard, De Larrabeiti's Borribles are a welcome relief. He has a wonderful imagination. His Borrible world and the three storylines are evidence of that.Unfortunately he is not a very good storyteller. The Borrible stories are definitely for an adult audience (it is quite violent and morally ambiguous), but the author writes as though he intended it for children. The characters are one-dimensional and the plots are not convincing.At best, the Borrible trilogy is a passable read. It is not a must-read. It may have a cult following, but it is far from a classic."
4,Lava Lamp,"I would have given it a five but it sorta wears out quickly, especially the green color that comes up..Its still unique tho.."
4,"shipped in ""okay"" condition","I bought this lamp for my girlfriend as a gift. when I received it, I opened the box to see that it was covered in bubble wrap, then placed inside a rectangular prism of cardboard, then placed inside the shipping box with a sac of air (air-filled bag). When I took the item out of the box completely, I was surprised to see that it had come in two different pieces... but then I realized, that it wasn't supposed to come in two different pieces! the item broke during shipping or processing or whatever it may be.. the baseplate of the lamp had broken off and was held on only by the wiring that connected to the light in the lamp to the power cord. I decided to super glue the baseplate back on. This is my only complaint about the product. other than the broken baseplate, it's a pretty good product. plugs right into the usb on the computer and viola ! just like the picture, except my lamp was black."
4,Podcasting is where it's gonna be,"I bought this book for a class I'm taking to obtain my degree and had no idea what podcasting was. This book is fantastic in the aspect of helping create a podcast for any size audience. It's easy to follow, easy to understand. The only fallback is that it does not offer software but it does reference a website or two where there are free downloads available. Happy Podcasting!"
4,"Good intro, could be a bit better","This book covers all the Podcasting bases, and IMHO is a bit better than ""Podcasting for dummies"". However, the author does newbies a disservice by posting screenshots from a $50 commercial sound editing product in addition to the popular and free ""Audacity"" software.Podcasting beginners would do well to spend their money on a good USB microphone before plunking down cash for software they can get for free.If they decide to pursue podcasting further, they can always upgrade the software later when they have a better idea of what they want to do...Similarly, newbies should not think too much about mixing boards, XLR mics, etc. when just starting out. Let's keep it simple!Just my $0.02 ..."
2,Hard to get Anything Tangible,"My coworkers and I read this together for professional development. It did not go over well. I reread the book a second time to try to get something to share, and it was meager at best. Leadership is a fickle subject and hard to define. Adair may be one of the first to apply definitions and case studies, but this book wasn't helpful for our team."
4,Handbook of mathematics and computational science,Handbook of Mathematics and Computational ScienceThis is a good book and it can be used in conjunction with Handbook of mathematical functions (by M. Abramowitz and I. Stegun)
3,"Too complicated, not enough steps","Deke is brilliant and he takes the time to tell you this throughout the book. If you wanted to ask a simple question, how do I place one image over the other and blend them together, you would have to do a lot of reading to find out. This should have been titled, advanced photoshop for math majors."
1,Uninsightful,Tends to reproduce the users manual. Better resources are available for free on line and IN COLOR. Not recommended.
2,Thick but not useful!,"I don't know why this book has a 4-5 starts rating. It's thick and big and seems has more than enough info to learn for photoshop. But I really have no interest to read this and i even can't learn anything from this book. It's hard to follow and the paragraphs are long but not useful. For beginners, i really won't recommend this book. I'd rather pick a quickstart guide instead.But when you go for the advance level and want to learn more details, it might be a good reference book."
3,Very nice layout. Not for intermediate to advanced users.,"The Photoshop 5 Bible provided a good source of information for the beginers. In my opinion, it lacked the ""in depth"" that it should have had on some of the sections. I did not like how it just quickly went over some areas. Personally, I feel that this book was to basic for Intermediate to Advanced users. Recommended for those starting out in photoshop."
1,mohan,"hi this is mohan mahat .i want to read the book ok photoshop 6.0.so sent me a book on the following address:mohan kumar mahatlele-9 lalitpur ,nepalco- gangaram mahatpatan industrial state,lalitpur ,nepal"
2,"Girl Wars: 12 Strategies That Will End Female Bullying""","I did not care for this book, I bought it for my grandaughters, and they did not cae for the way it presented information either."
4,Good - just not great,"I hadn't seen this show in around 20 years, so it was a huge treat to see it released even in a ""favorites"" compilation, instead of a season set.Having said that, I was a little disappointed that it wasn't as funny as I'd remembered it. Linda Lavin is really the weak link - the rest of the cast are in fine form. Highlight is Polly Holliday as Flo - she absolutely makes this show and I hope the complete series of ""Flo"" finds its way onto DVD someday.I would definitely recommend this DVD to anyone who either hasn't seen the show or needs a reminder. The six episodes are a great introduction to the series and I'm very happy to have it in my collection. Four stars (loses one because Linda Lavin should be funnier)"
4,A great starter set,"Still waiting for complete seasons of Alice to be produced on DVD, or at least the first four seasons. Truthfully, Alice just wasn't as funny after Flo was gone(kind of like if Seinfeld had lost one of his three sidekicks)and I gave this release four stars instead of five only because it includes ""Flo's Farewell,"" a sad moment for the series, but there are some classic episodes provided in this package. ""Alice Gets A Pass"" is a very early episode, and a daring one for handling the topic of homosexuality in such an open way for 1976. Other classics include ""Block Those Kicks,"" from Season three, as well as an episode from Season two and one I remember as one of the funniest from the entire series titled ""Close Encounters of the Worst Kind,"" in which Alice convinces everyone to be honest instead of passive-aggressive, leading to disastrous yet hilarious results."
4,"""Alice"" has a new home.","I watched Alice as a youngster and remembered it as a very funny show. When I saw it was available on DVD, I purchased it. The Amazon price was very reasonable."
5,Alice Complation DVD. Why are the studios doing this to us.,"Alice the complation DVD. not the complete first season as I thought coming on July 27th, 2006. that year and date is for the same item dvd. Alice complation. sorry about the mis-led info. But anyway, I love this show. and I hope that there will be a seasons set DVD release very soon."
2,Not too good,"I was very disappointed with this DVD. If these are the best six episodes of Alice, I would hate to see the worst six."
3,I want Season 1 - not some episodes,"I can't believe that Alice is being sold this way instead of just having Season 1 for sale (I actually wish it were all the seasons!). This is a show that had great ratings, lots of rerun airtime through the years, and was also written by the same team who wrote ""I Love Lucy""...need I say more? Please give Alice's fans what they want to buy, not what you want to sell. Selling a compilation is an outrageous way to do business."
5,good,"This was a very good item but overpriced for as few shows as it had on it. Sincerely, Sharon Farmer"
4,fun show,"I liked 5 of the six episodes on this disc. Wasn't to thrilled with the episode beating you over the head about how gays can be athletes and do not like little boys etc.Anyway, would like to see this show make it to seasons on dvd. Thought half of the episodes were really funny on this disc.Anyway Alice is also on a few of the Barney Miller's I have. She is really spazzy on those a big change from her character on Alice. I have the three seasons of Barney Miller out on dvd and she is on at least 3 of them.Kevin"
5,THE BEST SITCOM OF ALL TIME ON DVD!!!,"IT'S LONG OVERDUE THAT THE BEST SITCOM OF ALL TIME FINALLY BE RELEASED ON DVD! UNFORTUNATELY, IT IS NOT A COMPLETE SEASON OF THE SERIES!I HAVE ALL 202 EPISODES OF THE SERIES ON VIDEOTAPE AND HAVE TAKEN THE TIME TO TRANSFER THE ENTIRE SERIES TO DVD MYSELF... BECAUSE IT HAS AND ALWAYS WILL BE MY FAVORITE PROGRAM!!THERE WILL NEVER BE ANOTHER SITCOM LIKE THIS AGAIN!REGARDLESS OF THE TIME AND WORK IT TOOK COMPILING A 42 DVD SET, I AWAIT THIS SERIES TO BE RELEASED BY THE SEASON ON DVD!!HOPEFULLY THE RELEASE OF THE SERIES TO DVD WILL INTRODUCE PEOPLE UNFAMILIAR WITH IT TO THE UNIQUE QUALITY OF THE SERIES!AS A TRUE ""DEDICATED"" FAN OF ALICE, I AM GLAD TO FINALLY SEE IT ON DVD!!"
3,Wish There Was More On The DVD,"Although this only has six episodes, it's better than none. LOL I love Alice and I still watch the six over and over again!"
3,Alice - Random Episodes,"I bought this DVD for my father, he loved this show when it was on. Before I gave it to my father I watched it with my two boys and they loved the show. I wish their were more DVD's on Alice out there, like a season 1, season 2, etc... If you were a fan of Alice you will enjoy this DVD."
5,Just set back and enjoy.......,"My mom and I used to watch ""Alice"" every Sunday night when I was a kid. When I saw the DVD I just had to try it. My mom was in town for a visit when the package arrived. 30 seconds into the opening credits I was 20 years younger and enjoying a Sunday evening with mom from years past. I just don't see how this DVD could come close to a dissapointment. If you were a fan of the show at all. This will be a great addition to your collection."
3,Buffalo Bill Cody,"A good work on the life of Buffalo Bill Cody. It's written in a compilation form of all the prior works done on Cody, so at times it becomes arduous with several paragraphs running on with conflicting facts. The reader can get lost in the narrative as it's an exhaustive read for the ""not so"" ardent student of Cody. However, the author does accomplish his purpose in ensuring the reader gets a comprehensive overview from all the historic authorative texts. For an individual who just wants a ""fun read"" through the ""life"" of Cody, this isn't the book."
4,Good Read,"Very interesting story. My father-in-law lent me this book and I am glad he did. Having no previous knowledge of Buffalo Bill or his Wild West show I was fascinated about this era in our history. Being from a younger generation, I didn't grow up on cowboy and indian stories nor was I exposed to many westerns. It made me long to have lived in that time period. I especially enjoyed the parts on Annie Oakley. I hope the author decides to write a full biography on her."
3,12 steps,"I thought it was a regular size book, but it was a pamphlet style the same cost as a book and $3.98 shipping??I was disappointed."
3,Helpful,"As someone who does not pray the Rosary daily, I found some of the mysteries, particularly the ""new"" Luminous mysteries, difficult to understand. This book which was used by my Bible Study group was helpful in explaining the source of each of the mysteries. I have come to have a greater understanding of the Rosary and of the major events in the life of Christ as a direct result of using this study."
1,"when will they stop these ""martyr"" stories?","How do you rate a book that is based totally on lies? Christian ""Faith"" had absolutely nothing to do with the events of Columbine. It happened because two boys who had been ridiculed and picked on for years finally snapped. Christians were not targeted, blacks were not targeted. It's despicable that these people continue to put out these books that are nothing but lies."
3,"Basic recipes, with little family stories attached","Nothing unique or new with the recipes, quite basic, but loved herwee stories about her family and childhood."
3,A Fun Historical Mystery,"Nevermore opens with a double homicide in New York in 1923. This is followed by several more odd murders which seem to be based on the stories of Edgar Allen Poe.This book has a great cast of real characters including Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Harry Houdini, and Damon Runyan whose use of period slang is hilarious. Edgar Allen Poe also appears although it is never clear whether he is a ghost, a bend in time, or perhaps one of Houdini's illusions.There is a lot going on in this story: a little of the supernatural, a little romance, a bit of history. But, at heart, this is an historical mystery and it is here where I had my greatest difficulty with the book. Since there were very few fictional characters, it was pretty clear pretty quick who dunnit.Still, despite this, I really enjoyed Nevermore. It was a fun trek through New York at the dawn of the Jazz Age and this alone would make it worth the read."
4,I Liked It,"Houdini and Conan Doyle are two of my favorite people from history. This story was fun and enjoyable. It reminded me of ""The Alienist"" quite a bit, too. It is fun stuff--spritualism, magic, illusion, detective work...allhappening during a great time in history."
4,A fun fantasy.,"""Nevermore"" is a fun fantasy based on figures that we all know. The author takes some liberties with the relationship between Houdini and Sir Aurthur Conan Doyle, but the tale more than justifies these. It's a novel, not a history book.The imagery is vivid and as the book progresses it is a real page turner. I think that fans of Poe, Houdini, and Doyle will enjoy it."
5,Excellent Book!,"Get your hands dirty with this book, just like the author suggests! This book is the best darn how-to I have ever had. Beautiful color pictures and step-by-step projects that look like they will work. If I could afford 2 copies, I would keep one in the garage, and the other with my porsche library. I really, really like the format and the notion of 101 projects. Some are easy enough for me to do, some just tough enough that I would consider and a few that should be left to experts, but certainly provide me with the right questions to ask if I hire someone to do the toughy jobs."
5,"Logical, straightforward, very informative.","The skill ratings for the various projects might be a little optimistic, and the prices for the supplies are also a little low, but neither of these things take away from an excellent ""how to"" book that can get you through these kinds of projects on your own.The very first job you do will save you the cost of the book in shop labor charges, so on that basis it ought to get five stars from everyone who even uses it once. Hey, what's better than a free book?!? :)For anyone with a set of quality hand tools and the desire to do some of their own work on one of these classic cars, this book is a great resource to have on hand. I have no doubt I'll be buying another copy when I wear this one out. Or stain it with grease."
5,A Must have DVD,"I saw Rostropovich perform all six suites in Vienna during the mid-70s at the time he initially moved to the west. It was the first time he performed all six in one sitting. I also met the man after the concert, truly one of the greatest musical evenings I ever experienced. This man, a giant of his craft, makes these suites ""sing"". The recording was made inside a cathedral and to my eyes and ears, gets the visual and aural tone just right. These pieces are arguable at the apex of western music. The soloist quality of the performance is also an excellent entry point for anyone, particularly those with a jazz background, who want to ""get into"" classical music. ""Slava"" is at the top of his game in these recordings. A total must have for any DVD collection. Next stop: check out Rostropovich's CD interpretation of the Britten suites or Jacqueline DuPre's DVD of the Elgar Concerto. Cello heaven!!"
5,Fantastic,This is a fantastic CD especially if you are learning to play the cello as you can learn a lot of technique from watching this. This CD has made a huge impact on both my husband and sister-in-law. Worth every penny.
4,Nice DVD but component output / hdmi upconversion fails,I have a Sony upconverting dvd player and there is a strange purple hue when the upconversion is enabled. I have experienced the same effect using the component outputs on another dvd player. It makes it basically unwatchable. It looks normal without upconversion or over svideo. It's upsetting for such a fine dvd. It would be 5 stars otherwise.
1,james cagney classics-DVD-Genius-AMC,"i am a big cagney fan, and i am accustomed to AMC playing quality prints of classic movies, so you can understand my disappointment in seeing these poor quality transfers, especially since it says ""digitally remastered"" on the front cover. save your money and hopefully a remastered set of cagney movies will appear soon."
3,A slight musical featuring Cagney dancing,"""Something to Sing About"" is a slight musical made by Jimmy Cagney after his first break from Warner Brothers in 1936. Produced without the expertise and resources of a large studio, it is a modest affair which focuses on its magnetic star in a song and dance role. The music is pleasant, Cagney's dancing is always entertaining and there are some good songs with delightful arrangements. The plot takes band leader Cagney to Hollywood to become a star and it is entirely believable that some of the pot shots at stardom came from Cagney's own experiences. The film has some nice ideas but the pace is lethargic compared to the dynamic Warner's product and the editing is sub standard. Sure enough, Cagney returned to Warner's for his next film!The film has been in the public domain for a long time and the print is mediocre. The DVD contains no extras."
1,A good movie if you could watch and hear it.,"I bought this movie because I like old musicals, especially from the 1930's. The beginning of the movie was real good, but soon the sound broke up to where most of the sound wasn't there. I tried to fast forward and then rewind the movie on the VCR and play it. I did this several times and the sound still was broken up. If you enjoy good musicals, don't get it from Madacy Entertainment. Look for it on DVD."
4,Good but not for every one,After a shipping mistake the seller quickly sent the correct one out. My M&P .357 was very tight and my .357 snub nose revolver would get lost in this. Although there are many other guns including air soft guns that this will work for. This model just didn't suit my needs for both a comfortable fit both for me and my gun.
3,For the money-OK,It is inexpensive and lightweight and has a bit of trouble carrying differenet size weapons and the straps are hard to adjust just right for a good fit but for the cost it is worth it. With our self proclaimed King trying to take away our rights and freedom I recommend every good citizen get one and recommend every evil citizen to reconsider your life choices.
3,Faten Hamamah Speaks English!,"I knew that Faten Hamamah, the Egyptian superstar, played a role once in am MGM movie. But it didn't know it was Cairo until I had seen the movie. Unlike Omar Sharif, her ex-husband, who became a Hollywood superstar after Lawrence of Arabia; this movie had never been a fare chance for her.Anyhow, still many Arabs, including myself, want to hear and see Faten Hamamah (and some other Egyptian stars at that time) speaks English!"
1,Hamster doesn't use at all,He prefers the wheel and LOVES getting inside the little TV that amazon also sell. Skip this. You will not clutter up your cage as much and save money.
2,Shakespear it's not.... but so what,"This movie will never win an Oscar, but neither will 99% of the movies made. Seriously, this isn't that bad, not if you compare it to a lot of the other low budget movies made in the 70's and 80's. Plus William Smith is always fun. I give it two stars, worth watching on a rainy day when there's nothing else to do."
4,This is a wonderful book for ideas and themes!,"If you have younger or older children, this is the book for you! If you have no ideas where to start or need great ideas. This book is wonderful! I needed some different and neat ideas and I found them in this book. I just can't say enough about this book."
3,"cool game,but holy f is it hard!!!","I remember this game being a bit more easy as a kid of 12 or so when it came out,but jeez louise did my bro,his 2 buddies and I have trouble getting anywhere on the easy level,haha! They're all extremely avid gamers(mostly of the classic systems),but even they were stumbling just as much as my no-more-gamin' butt! I gave it 3 stars simply cause you can still have fun playing vs mode,but why would the story mode be so damn hard?!"
4,Education,"This book is full of great short articles which are quick to the point and yet useful information. The articles are usually pretty interesting to read as well, and contain some great ways to incorporate diversity and critical thinking in the classroom"
1,Politically Correct Rhetoric,"There are a few good ideas in some of the articles, but this book (as well as volume 2)is mostly just about being politically correct in the classroom. Each article is virtually the same thing, with a change of topic. A teacher describes some ""issue"" they faced in their classroom, describes how they handled it in a pc way and then tells how all the students and parents loved it and concludes by congratulating themself on what a great teacher they are."
1,"Politically correct, insidious garbage","I would call this book nonsense if only the ideas inside of it weren't so off base as to be harmful. Giving kids a proper view of reality should help them navigate the world better. This book and its lessons will not do that...it actually steers them in the opposite direction. The book provides practical ways in which your children can be taught about the horrible injustices of capitalism and the wonderful world of communism (it teaches only about the wonderful theoretical parts of communism, on a child's level). Whites are persons of privilege and only whites can be racist because only whites have the power to be oppressors. Basic skills are trashed. I kept this book...but only as a great example of how some ""teachers"" (people who SHOULD be teaching children ACADEMIC subjects but apparently don't have the time for that) are trying to indoctrinate children."
2,2D is better then 3D in this game,"I love the worms world party game, its great.Its simple to understand and play it.When worms 3D came out I thought this is gonna be great!Was I wrong.Its realy hard to understand how to play it.The good thing about this game is the graphics.I would get worms world party if I were u, because its the best!:-)"
2,Third dimension doesn't add to this game,"I first played Worms on my PC back in 96-97. I played it for hours with my friends. The 2D world was simple and easy to understand. The third dimension just added a lot of ambiguity to the game play. It's near impossible to use the wind to your advantage in 3D and the camera angles make aiming for opponents you cannot see very hard. Some people may enjoy this game, but I don't think anyone who loved the original 2D version will like this at all."
1,"Great Product, but Bad Price!","This is an excellent product. I have used it for ten years now and luckily have a very full thick mane of hair still! But this price is ridiculously high for ONE BOX. The picture is totally misleading. what they are actually selling is one box, even though they are showing you three boxes! there are plenty of other places where you can buy one box of Kevis for $25. Ebay for one. Or even just by calling and ordering direct from Kevis themselves. Again, great product though."
2,"Too rounded, doesn't creat even tension","This would be a great brush, but it was too rounded and created very uneven tension. Only can be used on straight hair."
4,The sounds produced by Al Hirt and his band are top notch.,"The sounds of the song Java are electrifying, soothing and come from the strong stylings of a great player. We listen to this album everytime we go up to the cottage and the island dances to his beat when we play it!! No one is better than Al Hirt to conjur the sounds of Old Style New Orleans."
3,Not his best work. Should have left Ann Margaret off,Ann Margaret's out of style vocals detract heavily from the Beautiful trumpet mastery of Al Hirt. Al also tries to sing here and it distracts from the magic of his trumpet. This is only for the collector who wants all Al's music. Get the more recent new releases of Honey In the Horn and Sugar Lips cd's first!
4,"I was looking for a couple of Al Hirt cuts that i liked, many are here","Yes, I am quite satisfied with this purchase.It has great cuts by Al and many of the Ann Margret vocals as well.Delicious."
2,Most recent cut on this CD was recorded in 1963.,"This is vintage Emmons. He showed his genius at an early age. My disappointment was that I thought I was going to here some recent renditions, since the the release date for the CD was 1997. Unfortunately, all the recordings were cut in 1963 and before according to the jacket."
1,The killer Allmans flopped on this album,"Don't even think about buying this one or the awful Brothers of the Road. Hell or High Water CD is a ""best of"" from these 2 stinkers that you should stay away from also. Instead pick up one of the classic original 5 albums (up through Brothers & Sisters) or something from the current 10 year-long reunion. Seven Turns, Where It All Begins and An Evening With are exceptional CDs from the recent era. ""Reach"" followed Enlightened Rogues which is also a great record, which makes this record sound even worse. They changed record labels for ""Reach"" & maybe that is what went wrong. It seems inconceivable that a band this great could actually record this."
3,Not as bad as some purists think,"This album, the band's first for Arista, marked the start of the Brothers downhill slide artistically. Arista deserves some of the blame -- it wanted another Doobie Brothers -- but there are still plenty of very good moments here, such as Hell & High Water (a great autobiographical song of the band's history), Angeline and a typically high-quality Dickey Betts intrumental, From The Madness Of The West. Reach For The Sky certainly couldn't equal what came before (or after, in the 1990s), but it's still a keeper album for me."
3,Still Enjoyable Although Not Prime Time Material,"Many critics have bashed this recording as a far cry from the Duane Allman era Allman Brothers Band. Whereas the band did try to imitate the Doobie Brothers and other corporate rock acts on this collection, there are certainly some highlights here.I like the gospel feel of the opening track, Hell And High Water. Greg and Dickie sound great singing together on this track. Its very reminiscing of sharing old times. From The Madness Of The West is an intriguing instrumental with a nice percussion/drum solo in the middle. Mystery Woman and Angeline are catchy radio friendly tunes.Maybe not quite on the level of Brothers and Sisters or Idlewide South but there are enough good moments to warrant a three and a half star rating."
2,I LIKE ANGELINE ! (but that's about it),"The two Arista Records albums are the weak links in the Allman Brothers Band catalog. Reach For The Sky (1980) has a few good moments, but it's nothing to write home about. I do like Angeline, though. Gregg's vocals are great on that one. Hell And High Water features shout-and-answer co-lead vocals from Gregg and Dickey, and From The Madness Of The West is a fair to middling Dickey Betts instrumental. Get this to complete your ABB collection, but their other albums are much better."
3,Potato Chip Book,"This book really was a potato chip book, briefly amusing, but not much in the way of substance. Angel was a strangely one dimensional character, with amazing luck, and Charles was overbearing, hard to believe he was more than a robot at times. This was a good book to pass the time, but there really wasn't much to it."
2,not durable,my ridgeback loved to chew on this toy - after on trip in the dishwasher - but shredded big pieces out of it in less than 30 min.the only toy that has not been destroyed by her is her kong (black one)...
4,Essential in the library of anyone working in the area,"This collection of papers from the first international workshop on the topic of steganography contains some of the earliest papers available, ones which are often referred to in the literature. This book should be considered as a conference proceedings, and anyone looking for a general introduction to the subject should look elsewhere. The papers are included full-length, and the collection constitutes an essential background. Together with the proceedings of the second workshop (IH'98), this text certainly goes recommended to anyone doing serious work in the area."
1,Amazon = Idiots?,"I can't really review the product itself. It may have been fine, but was packed so badly, all I received were glass shards and a scratched up frother.When I send a package containing glass, I make sure the outer box is large enough to allow packing around all sides of the object, not just on the bottom. Amazon did not do that. I make sure that the glass items can't clash against each other or against other items in the box.(The maker's packing, which could be seen under the clear plastic-topped box, had elastic bands to secure the items, but the bands weren't fastened over the items.) Amazon should have easily noticed the pieces rattling against each other and sent another. I know I would have. When I ship glass, I make sure the outer box is labelled ""glass"". Amazon did no such thing.I guess either Amazon is just a teeny-weeny inexperienced company that ships very few items, or they are idiots."
2,No communication and no product,"A little unsure of how to rate because I'm not losing any money. BUT, I ordered a used book on Dec 14th, they took the money and then nothing until today (Jan 12th) when Amazon sent me an email telling me they are refunding the money. Don't know what happened and it took almost a month to hear anything from anybody (nothing from the seller). Oh well, they go on my list to avoid."
5,"We love the ""sam"" stories",My 2 1/2 loves all of the Sam stories and we read them over and over! He is able to predict the words that are coming which is a good start to reading. I only wish there were more stories to buy!
1,My dog has cancer,"I ordered this for my dog sammy who has an aggressive form of cancer. So every moment counts with these herbs. I ordered this product on the 13th or 14th and had nobody tell me that it would be THREE weeks before they could even ship??? Wow trashy company and service... At least communicate when you have an order and cant fill it within a few days. Stupid companies hoping you dont notice how long they make you wait, well I ordered through another company and they had no problem shipping the next day. Sad..."
1,Doesn't help the itch,"I have tried it on 2 dogs, and it doesn't do anything to help their itch. I even tripled the amount to each dog, and still no results.I would not recommend it."
5,fun and packed with good advice,"Gutsy Women is packed with useful advice delivered in a readable, reassuring and fun way so this is the perfect little gift for the gal going abroad - or even just aspiring to. Travelers Tales have published a whole series of these tips books which are great fun to dip into and I especially love the case histories, lists and advice boxes."
1,LCD DISPLAY QUIT WORKING - BAD QUALITY,"Bought this camcorder at Best Buy a year ago. I made the purchase based on a long standing faith in Samsung products. The image quality was terrible. There is no light, so it is very hard to keep a focus unless you are outside in bright daylight. Sound quality was okay. But after one year of very light use, the LCD display quit working. I'll never buy another Samsung camera. I called Samsung they charge $160.00 to fix it. Brand new one is $200.00. It happened with a lot of people. BAD BAD BAD."
1,Good for 6 months,My SCD353 worked OK in first 6 months or so ( less than 10 hrs recoding). Then the picture quality become more and more blurry. I purchased a cleaning tape trying to fix it but no use.
3,Samsung MiniDV Camcorder,"The new product was accompanied by a CD which was not provided with this purchase. The CD contained all the software necessary to download and manipulate video. It has been difficult to find and download all the necessary software online to make this item work with my PC, which was my goal. Also, I discovered that the camera is so old that the high-volume flash memory cards will not work with it. The low-volume cards are hard to find. The camera works, though. It's just a disappointing purchase for me. Caveat emptor."
1,Very very disappointing product,"I bought this camcorder about 18months ago and it has always been inferior to my previous Canon camcorder (which unfortunately wasn't digital - hence the change)The display is poor, and totally useless in the dark, and dusk. Great for bright sunny days, but otherwise awful. I have just got it out again after 6 months left in a drawer (holiday time again!) and the LCD display doesn't work. Even if you look through the veiwfinder instead, there is no display. As camcorders are so cheap now, it will be better to replace than repair. Although I have loved Samsung products in the past I will now NEVER buy another camcorder. They are truly inferior and provide nothing but disappointment. Buy something else...you have been warned!!!"
3,Very good product but battery dies fast!,"Easy to use, setup and convert videos to PC. The problem is regarding battery life... Average rate is good."
4,Solid camera if. . . .,"I think this is a pretty solid camera if you purchase the cord to attach by firewire. I was using the provided usb cord and I noticed a lot of what other reviewers stated about a grainy picture. However, I just purchased a firewire and the difference is astounding. I purchased the cable from Best buy for around 35 dollars, but you can get them cheaper, I saw one online for about 8 dollars. A very wise investment. It is a very crisp clear picture, when in focus.The focus is a downfall, could be an excellent camera but it does have have trouble focusing. However, most cameras around this price have similar problems.Battery life does stink, but i have an extra one in my case, and you can charge it when you record. I used it to video tape my wedding and our honeymoon to Rome. I am very satisfied."
4,good camcorder,"this camcorder is a good product, have a good zoom, for the pictures the quality is low, but is a good device."
2,"Battery, focus problems","While the tiny size of this camera is a major plus, it leaves a lot to be desired in performance. The biggest problem I found is focus. Unless I have a defective one, it simply will not focus on zoomed-in objects, either in auto or manual modes.In low light (and frequently in daylight situations) the auto focus swings wildly back and forth as it can't make up its mind what to focus on. Getting to and operating the manual focus is awkward. The battery life is also a major minus. If you are doing any extended shooting you need to be plugged in to AC - your battery will not last beyond half an hour or so (maybe even shorter!) Low light shooting produces very poor results. Again, the major plus is its compactness; you can carry full video capability at the size of still camera."
2,Picture Quality and Focus,This is a nice camcorder at this price for kids; the recorded pictures plays well on LCD but on TV it is very bad it is all granular all places and color is spread all across. The camera doesn't focus instantly when zoomed in or out; picture blurs at that moment and remains for few more seconds. Initially I was very excited on getting a Mini DV camcorder at this price but later I regretted and want to get this replaced with little pricy but stable Sony or Cannon Camcorders.
2,A chocolate covered terd,"I was excited to get this product with all of it's neat little tricks and gadgets, I was extra excited with the zoom, I played with it for hours, wow this is a neat camera, of course I didn't have a tape to put in it yet, so first thing in the morning I head out to get a tape, I put it in and start filming, I filmed throughout the house and then outside changing different features and settings to see how they would appear on the video. I plugged it into the TV for playback and to my dismay the picture quality was this horrible grainy thing on my screen, it was worse than the camcorder I already have, and it is over 12 yrs old. Looks great on the outside, but underperforms."
4,Close to perfection! An absolute must read.,"For people interested in the theory and psychology of cinema, this is a great starting point and is a must have in any collection. J. Dudley Andrew breaks down the theories of Mitry, Metz, Arheim, and Bazin, among others, into easy to understand chapters without losing the essense of the theories. This book and the material are both so interesting that this will have you hooked on film theory. Instead of purchasing the individual books by each theorist, Andrew's book is the way to go in more ways than one. It is very easy to understand, which some books on film theory aren't, and he uses great quotes from each of the theorists. Andrew followed this up with ""Concepts in Film Theory"" which is the opposite of this book. It is much more difficult to understand and follow so beware."
3,Its ok,"I guess I had high expectation, but the book is okay kind of a read. I really didn't like it too much"
5,Entertaining and ribald mix of history and warfare.,An excellent blend of history and period detail carries a cast of savage warriors to a bloody showdown in Arthur's kingdom.
2,not much of a novel!,"great combat descriptions, really. but this work is too fragmentary. stuff happens, then something quite else, then the story takes a turn when it should be moving forward. drake should have made this into short stories. then it might have worked. not the fight in the end though, which somehow doesn't seem to fit in. this is like a warning to fantasy writers: sometimes you shouls make a short story, not a novel. this didn't really seem lie a novel to me. some of the things that happened and how they happened seem weird"
1,?????,Called petco to find out how many items i was going to receive if i bought this item. The man on the phone took 10 min. to tell me nothing. So frustrating that i ended up hanging up on the man. Horrible customer service.
5,A Keeper! Excellent read!,What does it mean to have the power of the Holy Spirit? When does the power come? Who gets it? What is the purpose?I found this book to explain and pull together scripture in a way that makes sense and order out of the confusion that often surrounds our knowledge of the Holy Spirit and what it means to be Spirit filled.I will definitely be keeping this book!Jean A. SturgillMotivational Speaker & Author
4,a good read! Uplifting!,"Tracy Klehn's Prayer Starters for Busy Moms: How to Pray All Day and Still Put the Laundry Away is literally a ""Godsend"" for moms searching for a way to begin a relationship with God, or those who want to renew a spiritual connection that has been lost in the chaos of life with young children.For moms who can't imagine having the time to sit down and eat--much less sit down and pray--this wonderful book is packed full of creative and thoughtful ideas for effortlessly weaving prayer into everyday activities.From scripture to poetry to personal anecdotes, Klehn has included something that will appeal to any mom who is looking for guidance and divine inspiration.Armchair Interviews says: Perfect for lifting spirits and rejuvenating the soul."
5,Great prayer book,This book offers practical tips for maintaining your spiritual self and coping with the demands of a family. Lots to think about.
5,Not a Bonanza Fan -- but love this CD!,"I've never really watched Bonanza, but this CD isn't just for fans of the show.I originally heard just a bit of Lorne Greene singing one of the songs and his voice was incredible! I got the CD to hear more.The way the CD is put together is also a treat in that it gives the feel that you are invited to a family gathering where these songs are being sung just for the shear enjoyment of singing.I'd recommend this to anyone who likes good singing and story telling."
4,Welcome to Marlboro Country!,"20 years ago, while working at a radio station in small town North Ontario, my friends and I got hooked on re-runs of ""Bonanza."" Then, last month when I saw this CD, I just had to have it. Here are the Big Sky/Cowboy Songs, served up with a sly wink from the head of the house at the Ponderosa. Put this CD on and (if you can put aside your 90's hipness) you'll be whisked back to 1892. Maybe it's Christmas Eve and you've been invited to the Ponderosa for a party. The Cartwights have taken it upon themselves to enterain. And here comes ""Paw"" himself, Ben Cartwright, to tell a few stories and sing some cowboy songs. Play this CD with that kind of attitude and you won't be disappointed."
5,EDDIE K,"On what was to be Eddie's 9th solo lp but his first free on Motown,we see a more smoother,mellower crooner. I just adore this whole album. Proud to say i still have the original vinal copy in excellent condition."
4,Preview of Superman V,"The great tradition of the heroic Man of Steel continues. Superman has finally met his match. Hey, if your a Superman fan, you gotta read this one"
3,graphics needed,"the exposition is very clear and the teacher make a courageous and mostly successful effort but it looks ridiculous when he tries to use his arms to indicate different planes, lines etc. etc. in three dimensional space. computer graphics would have led to an immense improvement, the product would have warranted a rating of 5 stars"
5,A beautiful Gaelic album. Creates a mood and sense of place.,"I bought this tape on a trip to Scotland and listened to it while driving. It was a perfect accompaniment to the Highlands. Ms. McPhee has a wonderful strong voice. The songs on the album range from somber to sprightly. They are all in Gaelic, which is only a problem if you are trying to match one you are listening to with one on the list. I highly recommend this title."
5,Great Set to Have,"Since some genius decided to quit printing the box set of Ernie's work, another company saw their chance and jumped at it and here's the result.It is, actually, better arranged in this set than the box set for several reasons.First, the songs are in chronical order as they should be.Second, some of Ernie's best work, his gospel, spirituals, and hymns are represented. They were sorely missed in the box set. They close out the collection. This is approriate since Ernie closed most of his TV shows with one.Third, the song ""Hicktown"" representing Ernie's brief comeback on the country charts is included.A few more of Ernie's covers on country and pop standards would have been appreciated, but overall an excellent job."
4,Why haven't the blues crowd put a claim on Tennessee Ernie?,"The only genres you'll find this man listed under are ""classic country"" and ""gospel"". That's legit enough as far as it goes, but then how do you explain his signature hit ""Sixteen Tons""? It got most of its exposure on pop radio with the Elvis stuff. It's not only blues in the classic Leadbelly ""working man as a two-legged draft animal"" tradition, the beat is moderate swing and the chord structure is bona fide jazz. About the only thing that might make it even faintly country is that the workplace mentioned is a coal mine, ""company sto'"" and all. Step up the beat a bit and Brian Setzer wouldn't give it thumbs down. Transpose it up half an octave and Tony Bennett would sing it. It goes to show you that pigeonholing music can be just as misleading as it is instructive."
4,Ultimate Tennessee Ernie Ford,I bought this CD for a few songs that I liked but was amazed at the number of song by Ernie that I had never heard. From a purely historical perspective of country music it is worth the price.
5,m,Excellent service. Well packaged and on time. Can not beat the service I have gotten from this last book order.
1,Even the title is taken from the 1996 original,"This book contains salient observations, most of which were shamelessly lifted from the book, ""Yeshua the Hebrew Messiah or Jesus the Christian Christ?"" which was published in 1996, and written by Ben Ammi. I recommend reading the original, first and foremost."
4,A little like the Da Vinci Code. . .,"While this book is not a novel, but rather historical scholarship, the work reads a little like the Da Vinci Code, in that it is fast paced and sheds new light on Jesus' life. This is a must read for all those who want to learn more about the historical Jesus."
1,dubious assertions and poor knowledge,"this seems mainly targeted at an evangelical and messianic Christian demographic but it is difficult to take seriously by anyone with serious knowledge of hebrew, greek, aramaic and the Bible.Gordon talks down or rather often preaches down to his audience, which is certainly not anyone in the scholastic field, who would be well aware that much of Gordon's assertions consistute hair splitting and hand waving, rather than actual erudition and fact.Still Gordon is very much preaching to the choir and I expect that choir will meet what he has to say with thoughtless applause."
4,Title might be misleading.,I thought this book was going to cover more of the New Testament than one book. I really like the approach taken and the way the author explains the steps he went through in arriving at the conclusions he suggests in this book. I was prepared to go more in depth. Very thankful for his realization that his audience may not know what is meant by/implied with various Hebrew terms and titles. Good job at anticipating the background information that Christian readers will need to understand the path that he takes towards truth. If you have an IPOD or PC you might want to consider the kindle addition of this book for $12.
1,it is garbage,"it is garbage, I bought an original thought, the smell lasts for 30 minutes. do not buy this garbage. Sell &#8203;&#8203;Now do not need a fake. bvlgari smell good, but you're selling musor.eto wrong. do not cheat customers, and to write that it is not real. originala smell remains the whole day. and that a few minutes"
3,Starecase  - Firstfloor,"Starecase came during the heyday of progressive trance/house/breaks, and while it may sound typical for this period, it does have some crowd-pleasing moments, like on ""Faith,"" which has a nice pop sensibility with its vocals. ""(Sound Two) Second Time"" hits the 4/4 for more club friendliness. ""Stuck in the Middle"" gets more aggressive. But they can also operate on other moods: the slower ""Understand Me"" opens with a nice spacey melody before the bass kicks in to rough things up, while ""Come In"" has a delicate guitar line to add a fragility to an otherwise rockin' track. ""Aishiteru"" maintains the dreamy feel throughout. ""The Bitter End"" rounds out the album with a galloping beat. Curious that there was never a second floor from these guys, but what we have is still enough to stand on."
4,Tight production,"If you like Hybrid or Max Graham, you should besatisfied with Starecase. The first track, theCD's single, is a throbbing, tight track with aGREAT female vocal. Tracks 1-5 and 7 are allexcellent. Track 7 is not a dance track at all,rather a melodic chill-out. Track 3 would be myfavorite, with rolling deep bass, a funky techline and similar phat female vocals.The only thing that detracts from this being afull on five star album is the vocals on track6... I ask myself time and time again why danceproducers even think about using cheesy malevocals. Featuring lyrics such as:""Deep inside of me... There's a psychadelic sea""Eeeeek. Come on man. Disregard track 6 and you'vegot a solid album from one of my personal favoritesin the dance production scene. Crank this one up."
5,Worth reading for anyone working in the industry,"The book provides a comprehensive look at the economics and rationale of product development, pricing and marketing in the healthcare market. Anyone who thinks that we (collectively) are being gouged by the medical device or pharmaceutical industry should take a look at the signficant costs incurred and capital risked by companies trying to innovate in that market.While the approach taken in the book is largely academic, the information provided is easily understood by a general audience."
4,Good but could be better,"An ambitious book (derived from a business school MBA course) that uses experts to deliver an overview of market structure/dynamics in Pharma, Biotheraputics, Medical Devices and Informatics. The material is generally interesting and reasonably well presented although the partiality of the authors is often a little too noticeable ('irrational exuberance' is probably the best way to describe the chapter on medical devices). There are also surprising omissions - medical imaging is dismissed in a short paragraph, WTO discussions on compulsory licensing non existent and the issue of reference pricing is mentioned but left unexplored.The content is also beginning to show it's age (2003 imprint) and the data underlying some of the chapters is nearly a decade old.That said it's a good overview particularly of pharma and remains readable and coherent throughout."
4,october wall mural,LOved the wall mural.. Would have gave it 5 stars if it came all in one piece. Came in 8 pieces and had to put it together like a puzzle it was very hard!
3,Nice Star - Chain Too Thin,The star itself is very nice (as pictured). The chain is too thin. Gave it as a gift and it broke within a week so I had to go out and buy another chain.
4,Very Nice Necklace,"I have worn this necklace nearly every day over the weeks since I received it. I love it. It's small, subtle, and elegant. As stated in many of the other reviews, the chain is somewhat flimsy (which is what prevented me from giving this five stars), and will need to be replaced eventually. But I've been mindful of the chain and haven't broken it yet, and overall, I am extremely happy with this item, and also am very happy with the fact that it's not made in China, as so many things are these days."
5,"Super Duper Kids', Toddlers', or Babies' Vitamin!","I've been using Liquid Health Children's multi for my kids for a couple of years, and I LOVE it (and so do they)! It tastes great and is concentrated, so I just add their doses to plain water and they drink it like juice. As long as they're taking this supplement, they tend to stay very healthy; when I've run out and they haven't taken it for a couple of weeks at a time is when they always seem to get sick. I love the fact that it's food-based, so I can give them extra doses if they seem to get getting a cold or anything, and I don't have to worry about overdosing them. And it also contains NO honey, which means that it's safe even for babies. Check out the adult Liquid Multi, too - I take it myself and LOVE it, too!"
2,Block that metaphor!,"So much of The Memory Palace is compelling: the secondary and most of the primary characters, the depiction of life on a working estate at the time of the civil war, and the vivid picture of the plight of a single woman at that time. But the central conceit, the Memory Palace of the title, is a metaphor that becomes increasingly strained, leading to one of the more far-fetched denouements I've read, not to mention some laughably stilted dialogue. Oh dear..."
3,Come On Everyone calm down!!!!!,"Yes Im a huge fan, yes this album is ok. But just ask yourselves. How can a Best Of CD not include ONE track from their 2 best albums by far; Iron Age and ""Black Radio..""Nah, this is ok, but they didnt hit their stride, and WHAT a stride it was, till 1980. Save your money and buy those two great albums Ive already mentioned!Incidentally Im very very disappointed at their new one, after waiting for over a decade. That is sad!"
5,Great game,"I had this game before when I was growing up but it was the Deluxe edition. I moved out of my parent's house and wanted to continue to play it. Instead of splurging for the deluxe edition again, I bought just the regular and I love it. The graphics are old, but it's a classic game that I never get tired of playing."
3,Argh!,"This game is good...up to a point. Like the bots in Quake 3, the senarios are either very easy or very HARD. I've also noticed that when you start a mission, if you enter the cheat that reveals the whole map, you'll notice that the enemy always has more than TEN chests of gold and at least FOUR artifacts right within easy reach! All this while YOU have to scrounge by to surivive in the early game! Later on, when you control vast armies, which would make Waterloo look like little kids playing War, you'll run into computers which will, naturally, have armies approximately three times larger than your own. The game CHEATS! Trust me, you'll be screaming in rage too when you enter the scene with twenty of your best units and find that the computer has seventy of his. At least it's not as bad as HOMM2, which had one mission put you up against more than 200 bone dragons!"
2,Better choices out there,"I've owned a set of this type before and they were great, but this one is not. There is no strap to hold it in place so every time you get in the car you have to prop the back part up again - more irritating if your hands are full or you're trying to get in just right with a skirt or coat on. Also this one only comes up to about the middle of my shoulder blades so it's very annoying to lean back on.Find one that has straps, is taller, and maybe even comes in a set. I know it's out there, I used to own it!"
5,Great!,"I was a bit apprehensive at first, becaise I had never bought any books on line, but rising cost of books are a complete rip-off when you by them from the campus, that I was willing to take a chance. I purchased the books on 13th ans was set to receive them by the 27th, but I got it on 18th. 8 couldn't believe how easy it was. The merchandise was in good condition and I was very pleased with the whole transaction. This will forever be my way of getting any and all of my textbooks. Thanks"
4,Just Like Dad by Myriah Rangel,"The title of this book, is Just Like Dad. It's by Gina, and Mercer Mayer. I liked this book, because it shows how the son wants to grow up like his dad. It teaches him things, that he will grow up to do. My favorite character was the little critter because, he always wanted to be just like dad, but with a little twist to it."
4,"Good, but...","I enjoyed playing Might and Magic VII. The storyline kept you moving along, and the interactions with the different geographic areas made most of the questing fun and worthwhile. The game is heavy on killing and light on puzzles, I suppose I'd like a little more balance there. However, I'd like to commend the creators on one thing above all else, ARCOMAGE. A game within the game, played in the inns throughout the land, was really fun. I love the fact that there are two different paths to take (good/light vs. evil/dark). That makes the game replayable at least twice. Playing around with the character classes is good for another game or two as well. My only strong criticism is that the dark side quests were buggy, and I had to download the patch and restart my dark side game to get my final warlock and lich promotions."
2,I was robbed!,"MM6 was very good (4 stars) for it's time. I would expect at least as good if not better from it's offspring. Well, that's my fault. When New World bring's out their next offering, that's their fault, because I won't be waiting with my $$$$$$. Constructively.... 1) Kill, Kill, Kill...I just finished a full day of duking it out with truckloads of Golems and Dragons only to find a Barrow Downs full of silly little goblins, ghosts and such...whats the point. 2)The game is too much about gold and experience and not enough about quests and adventure. 3)The storyline is transparent and passive, partly because most of my efforts are centered on $$$$, experience and Kill, Kill, Kill but mostly because, suddenly, for the last 2 to 5 percent, we shift gears from a medival slaughter to deep sea diving and a futuristic Space Ship and the games over. NWC, you owe me an apology and $60 CDN."
5,Never get tired of it,"This is my favorite game. I have played it for years. I started playing it with my sons and as they have moved on to other games I kept coming back to this one. I love the terrain, the characters and most of all the tremendous aura of adventure and of venturing into a different world.Its my favorite escape. I wish someone would make a virtual reality version of this game."
1,It feels like someone stole my money.,"I guess I was spoiled, after playing Baldurs Gate and Diablo. The 3d perspective was poorly done, combat was tedious and hard to manage. The story seemed without a real plot. I really cant believe a company can release a product like this. Stay away."
4,Great following up to Might & Magic VI.,"I definitely like this. Certain things are more complex, which is fun. The primary storyline is very different from M&MVI and involves the player-characters in the politics of the region more than its predecessor. The only problem I have is that it has some technical difficulties operating in the Windows Vista environment, which M&MVI did not present; but these do not detract from the game or its enjoyment."
4,4 Stars and I'm just out of the starting gate...............,"I'm giving this game 4 Stars out of the ""gate"" because it's pretty much just like ""M&M 6"" and that's definitely a good thing. M&M 6 in my opinion is one the the best in the series and so far 7 has got me wanting to continue more of the late night session i spent with it's predicessor. Oh, and by the way, if you are having trouble getting this game to run,read on a few reviews down,( if you are reading the reviews in order of the 'date reviewed') you'll see a very simple solution shared by one of the reviewer's that works. Fret not,the game does run on XP,you'll just have to have a little 'Know How' and a little patience.-----Darvius7"
3,"Good game, but nothing new","The best feature of this game, I agree with most, was the Arcomage mini-game. If they haven't already, 3Do should turn this into an actuall game. The option to choose between the light and dark path was nice, but the overall game was too much like MM6, without enough new features. The use of the invisibility spell makes it too easy, though, and I found myself almost done at level 20."
3,Another Example of sitting on your laurels,"Here is a game that, rather than doing anything new after the success of its predacessor, chose to simply reuse an outdated graphics engine and make the gameplay insanely repetative. Not to say that it doesnt have any of the things that made Might and Magic 6 good in it but with games like baldur's gate and Planescape: Torment out there are much much better ways to spend your gaming dollar."
2,Shadow of a great past,"It's sad. I always liked the Might and Magic (MM) series. It was fairly simple but the built-in journaling and mapping tools made it less of a pain than other RPGs. Unfortunately MM seems to be frozen in time and this version doesn't appear to have any changes from previous one. There is a new storyline, or more precisely, a new variation of a Might and Magic storyline but graphics, sound, monsters, spells, skills and interface at all the same. I couldn't get the game run with DirectX under Windows 2000, software mode only, although the game is listed as NT-compatible. Keyboard shortcuts would stop working and occasional clipping problems got me stuck and forced a reload to get out. The sound is what really drove me crazy. The character voices can be cut off but not the NPCs. I'll have 'Have a pleasant evening!"" ringing in my head for years.For die-hard Might and Magic fanboys only."
2,Pictorial History of the Carousel,"I will admit that this is a great history of the Carousel from 1964. However, I was very disappointed in the pictures. They are all black and white. Not what I was hoping for."
4,"Great Collection, but......",".....since none of the other reviewers seem to notice, I'll point out that ""If I Could Reach You"" by the Fifth Dimension is mastered WAY too slow.Otherwise, a great collection of love songs, most full length (""Nights in White Satin"" runs 5:50, with the ""Late Lament"" poem at the end missing), but a truly satisfying listen. I've pulled back one star for the mastering glitch mentioned above."
4,Relaxing game...,"I like this game for PSP! I'm not a gamer, and I just wanted a fishing game with good graphics and nature sounds. You can mute the annoying music in the ""options"" of the game, leaving only the sounds of the streams and fish. I recommend it, especially if you like to fish!"
2,we dont really care for the game,the game itself we dont care for but the fast service we recieved was very great
5,I love this cookbook!,"I have hundreds of cookbooks, but when this was given to me from a friend a few years ago, it made it to the top of the heap. With most cookbooks, I find a recipe or two that I love and use frequently. With Blanchard's Table, I have made probably half of the recipes and about 90% of those are favorites in our family. I love the quick marinades, dips and starters, and other little tips in the book in addition to the main recipes - we use these all the time. Highly recommended!"
4,"very good, i recommend it","i consider it a good idea for studing to OCA exam test. Even if you have not experience with Oracle databae, it is recommended for beginers.i recommend to read it more than one time, because there are so much details to know at the exam... practice a lotthe book cover all the topics presented by the Exam"
1,It's a mistake to buy this book...,I found some answers are not related with the questions. Some typo error and mislead information.
2,OCP Oracle 10g Administration II Study Guide,"I installed the OCA ebook software to read the OCA book and it succeeded. But then I installed the OCP ebook software and when I bring it up to read the book online, the Adobe Reader comes up, waits 60 seconds with a blank screen, and then crashes.P.S. I'm dissatisfied with having to do an install just to read the document online... and it FAILS!"
4,Love your work Suzi,This is another compliation in the compliation trail that record companies issue with Suzi Q's material. A great shot of Suzi on the cover looking very cute and with a lovely sexy smile on her face.Disky communication has released quite a few Suzi compliations now i hope in the near future that they will remaster a couple.
4,Fauna Flash - Confusion,"Confusion, the aptly named remix album off Fauna Flash's Fusion, starts off with a great Dzihan & Kamien mix of ""Mother Nature."" Dzihan & Kamien keep getting better, and this mix reinforces that fact. The three remixes of Tel Aviv are incredibly wide-ranging, from Stephane A.'s deep house mix to Peter Kruder's electro-bop to Charlie Dark's moody Afro-house. Pole's mix of ""Ten"" is typical Pole, warm sounds and stop-start dubs, while the Salvador Group's long and stripped-down take on ""Free"" changes tempo halfway through for a nice contrast. These mixes should be more than enough to clear up any confusion about whether or not you should respect Fauna Flash."
5,Chip and Dale at their Best,"Chip, Dale, Monty, Gadget, and zipper star in this fun-filled favorite about a good guy gang of heroes out to help those in need; the Rescue Rangers.Disney review:Segment 1:In Dale Besides Himself, Dale mistakes an alien spaceship for the world's biggest walnut. When he discovers that the creature on board can change their shapes at will, Dale unwisely thinks it would be fun to clone around with them!Segment 2:Dale's favorite TV hero Flash, the Wonder Dog is dognapped by the jealous Fat Cat, and his gang of goons start a crime spree... all disguised as Flash! It's up to the Rescue Rangers to convince Flash's fans that he's not a fake and a flake!"
3,Wonderful series,"Though this particular VHS did not have some of my favorite episodes, (some of mine where ""Adventures in Squirrel Sitting"", ""Gadget Goes Hawaiian"" and the pilot episode). Chip and Dale Rescue Rangers is still a great hilarious series with memorable characters. Every scene and character trait brought back a flood of memories. It is a series that still holds up well over time. :D"
5,A good read,"This is a good book. I don't want to spoil anything for you, so I'll end here.P.S. It's a good book"
2,Sat II Biology E/m (Kaplan),"I thought that this book gave a decent review of the materials needed for taking the SAT II Biology, however all the material covered in the review was at times too brief and assumed that the reader had already mastered the material. If one did not have a firm grasp on the material or had not learned the material yet, that person would have a difficult time making any sense of the material. There were elements of the book that I did like, such as the don't mixed these up on the test day, located in the margins. These inserts provided general bits of info that were important. My recommendation is to buy this book only if you are well versed in all the aspects that are covered in the SAT II Biology. Otherwise you should go get the Princeton Review Biology book, since it does a much better job of explaining the material."
2,Practice tests weren't good,"I used this book to review for the SAT II and while the information was ok, the practice tests were very different from the actual test. I scored around 700 on all three practices, but got 790 on the actual test. Only buy this book for the review, not the practice tests. Barrons did a much better job with practice tests."
2,A Useless Preparation Guide,"I think that this book is great, if one has 7 months to prepare for the SAT II Biology! Seriously, the amount of detail in this book is silly. You might be better off studying from your textbook. The practice tests are completely off, and those stupid stress relief guides at the end are just there to add more cents to this book's cost. The purpose of a preparation guide is to provide an organized, structured review, condensing as much of the course into a single, cohesive unit. This books fails in that aspect. You are never going to be quizzed on what oxaloacetate is from the Dark Reactions! And enough of those ""I got 560, but with this book I got 800!"" stories. It won't happen. I feel this book is a waste of time."
2,OK but not what I expected,"This album consisted of 3 CDs. I was looking for traditional renditions of all hymns, but some definitely were presented with a folksy downbeat that I didn't appreciate. Of course, I'm a product of the early 1950s vintage hymn. Other than that, the sound quality was fine and the choruses were professional-sounding.Some would probably have rated this higher but they had different expectations."
4,A fine set of church hymns,"With three CDs full of fine music, this is both a pleasure to listen to and a great bargain. One of the very best things about this set is the variety of styles - chorus with organ, solo, some beautiful instrumental arrangements, some jazz arrangements, and so on. This contrasts with an older CD we have where one chorus-organ piece follows another until you get bored. The quality isn't always super-professional - e.g. chorus is a little ragged sometimes - but that's more like church, isn't it? Highly recommended."
5,I saw Woman of the Year on Broadway,I was lucky enough to see the Original Musical on Broadway with Lauren BacallI urge every broadway fan to get this cd for your listen enjorment
5,Be glad it's back!,"A great soundtrack, glad to see it's available again. Some excellent tracks here, but I would recommend grabbing Vol. 1 as well - they complement each other and both really hold some indispensable music for those who love the series.It's nice to buy a CD you'll really listen to long term. This is one of those albums."
1,You may want to buy some super glue.,"This toy would be great if it were actually something that could survive play. The plastic material for the oven window was out of place when taken out of the box...before little hands had even touched it. This was due to a wooden piece in the inside door having already separated and needing to be glued back into place. After having opened and closed the oven 3 or 4 times (15 minutes into play), the oven handle broke off. Ridiculous. We are now most likely going to replace with another kitchen set all together. This one is a big waste of money."
1,DONT BUY IT!!!!,"This is a very poor quality kitchen set. Its oven handle, tap and the back bar came apart the second day I bought it. It is not at all worth 50$. I would price it for 4$. Ignore the good reviews and SAVE your money. Dont buy it!"
2,"Warning: not worth the money, deceptively advertised.","We were highly disappointed. Way over-priced. Something of a con-job, really.Watch the fine print. They don't send you any of the pots and pans or pot holders shown in the pictures. These have to be bought separately. Overall workmanship is second-rate. The rack and faucet are not properly attached. You could get a high quality handmade equivalent from your local woodworker for less than this price.Not recommended."
3,"toy kitchen, better for older toddler","I purchased this for my 18 month old daughter to put in our RV. It would be a great product for an older toddler. My baby stood on it, sat on it, and really used it as a stepping stool. Due to this abuse she broke the door. I have now put it up until she is older. SHe did like taking the ""sink"" in and out. I love the size and that it is wooden."
1,falls apart after 5 times of use,I guess this is what I get for spending $40. I bought it for my daughter to play with something at my grandfather's. We only go about once a week and she's only played with it 5 times... the handle has come off and the sink faucet doesn't attach at any point so she keeps pulling it out. It doesn't keep her interest for very long.
4,toy kitchens,It was purchased for my grandson. He has really enjoyed it. It is great for a small home and very durable. I also purchased a small version for my other grandson and he also has enjoyed it very much.
1,This purchase was a complete mistake,"It looks cute enough in the picture but there are 2 reasons why this toy is terrible. First, it is way too small. My 17 month old even has to sit down to play with it. Second, it fell apart as soon as we put it together. The manufacturer doesn't secure the oven handle, hook bar, or faucet to the body of the toy, so they just come right out. My daughter simply can't use it, so I've had to super glue these parts in. This was a complete waste of money, and to be honest I can't believe they have the gaul to charge that much to begin with. We just bought a much sturdier and appropriately sized toy stove at a reasonable price, and we're getting rid of this one asap."
3,Shoddy workmanship,"While the set is adorable, the one we received was not very durable. This is not a toy for a child who pulls things off like our children. I think 3 is a stretch unless your child is extremely docile and not in the least curious! These were the problems RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX 1) The dowels came unglued from the water knob, leaving it screwed unto the unit, the back towel rack does not secure, the dowels for the stove handle were not the same length, and they also came unattached to the door. We will have to shave, glue and unattached moving parts that can get list, like the sink spout! This item is small, more like a microwave, perfect for us because we live in a small house, but if you are looking for something for your toddler to stand at while on the floor, this will not be the case, it will need a table. We will be keeping as it is a gift and we will make the adjustments, but this was our experience with this product."
4,"This is just the kitchen, no accessories.","I was disappointed to find out this is just the kitchen and the plastic yellow 'sink'. The accessories pictured are not included and must be purchased separately. It's also pretty tiny, my 30 in. child towers over it, but when sitting it's perfect height.It's a decent little kitchen set and we are going to pick up the accessories at Ikea."
2,Toys,Very dissapointed in size of kitchen set. I would not have purchased it if I new how small it was.
4,Little Kitchen,"I read the other reviews for this kitchen, and for the most part, they are correct. As soon as I opened the box, I figured I would glue the pieces down...no biggie for the hassle it will have saved if I didn't glue them. There was an odor when I first opened the box, but by the time I had the kitchen put together it was gone. As for the size...read the product description. I don't understand how people buy online, sight unseen, without reading the full description first. This is a small kitchen. Its great for my little one. I think I'm going to follow another reviewers advice and put a small felt over the magnets on the oven door. I do wish the product didn't need these few modifications but, again, its worth the extra fifteen minutes to not have to deal with the kitchen coming apart later."
2,Great concept - poor execution,"We bought this for our 2 year old and while she loves it, we've had problems from point one. The first one arrived without the hanging rack and hooks, so we had to send it back for a replacement. The second one had all the parts, but they don't fit together well. The faucet and hanging rack fittings are too small for the holes so they are very wobbly. Also, don't let the picture on the website/box fool you: the hanging rack is NOT tall enough to hang many of the accessories that are shown on it. We purchased the Alex completer set that matches the items on the picture and only one pot (the smallest) will hang from the hooks. The utensils and the other pots are too long to hang from it. Seems like Alex Toys has some quality control issues. Our little one doesn't seem to care about all these issues however, and she is having a great time with it, so take our complaints for what they're worth."
3,Slightly Disappointed,"I purchased this item in attempts to duplicate one my daughter had when she was two. She loved it; it was her favorite toy and it kept her very busy. However, the craftsmanship and quality of this item isn't the greatest. The oven door is hard for my granddaughter to close; she tried to force it and ended up breaking one side of the door. We glued it but it happened again to the other side, so we just took the door off. She's o.k. with that. We had a couple of small magnetic parts that we couldn't figure out where they were suppose to go. I wouldn't purchase it if I were you."
1,not so good.,"Don';t pay the outrageous prices for this record. As far as Spudmonsters records go, it is their worst. Get MOMENT OF TRUTH or STOP THE MADNESS insted! You''ll be disappointed if you pay the i8nsane prices posted on here for this record."
5,A Great Work,"Forrest, though contreversial was without a doubt one of the best generals on either side in the Civil War. He was able to do more with less than many others in similar situations. With no education and being looked down upon by most of his peirs that is an especially impressive achievement.Henry's work is also good in that it allows us to contrast biographies todaywith the ones from previous times. Henry pays little attention to Foresst's role in the Klan and portrays his slave trading and slave holding in the most positive light possible (dim though that may be). A more modern biographer might well blaze a blinding light upon these activities to the exclusion of his battlefield achievements.I would recomend this work to the reader interested in the Civil War. It does not cover much else in the life of Forrest. It is well written and a good read."
4,A good read...,"This is a biography of one of the most misunderstood leaders of the Second War for American Independence, Lt. Gen. N. B. Forrest, CSA. While concentrating on the war years, Henry does give light into Forrest's postwar activity, including his official disbanding of the KKK in 1868, a fact generally overlooked by yankee revisionist historians. A good read, and reccommended."
4,interesting book!,"Being fairly new to eye tracking I found this book an interesting read actually. It starts off by covering the history (of the research) of seeing/watching/looking to then continue with the biological and psychological aspects of looking at things, extrapolated to eye tracking today.Eventually the book will start talking about all sorts of technical stuff halfway part II of the book, that I as an Interaction Designer am less interested in, but then in part III and IV the book gets interesting again.Not a lot about HCI or marketing side of eye tracking, but as a whole the book gives the reader a pretty good idea of what eye tracking can be useful for."
4,excellent overview,This book has been very helpful in both setting up my eye tracking lab and providing theoretical and methodological background material.
5,A valuable read,"This text was required for a class I am taking but is a great resource for anyone considering any type of counseling, pastoral care or intensive discipleship."
1,cheap attache,"This was something that I could of bought at the flea market for 20 bucks and it cost me $60 with shippng. The leather is cheap, it is so thin that they lined it with batting to make it feel thicker. Buyer beware. Would not buy again. Bottom grade leather :("
1,Bait and switch?,"This product is terrible. The quality is horrible and the color is not even close to that of the picture. The photo online makes it look good. The reality is that in person, it looks like a bag that you might find at the Dollar Store."
1,Ab Loops of Trouble,"I should have read the legal disclaimer before purchasing this product. They are absolutly right; this thing can, and probably will, hurt you. The Ab Loops use velcro to secure itself to the bar. I know they claim the loops will hold 300 pounds, but for how long and whose willing to risk it. I'm having mine modified to be more secure. Bottom line: you get what you pay for, and these were the cheapest ones on Amazon"
5,Downtempo Ethnic Fusion at its best,"This collection of classic arabic songs that I grew up listening to has been superbly remade into very relaxing atmospheric downtempo beats, perfect for chilling in the tub, reading, cooking,entertaining, and for those that know the original classic songs, what a treat. If you are a fan of Claude Challe, then this will appeal to your palette."
4,"A raw, real country gospel record","Wow... Merle really gets about as far down into the real Baptist church bedrock as you can get on this stark gospel set, recorded at the height of his fame in the early 1970s. He sings at two churches, in a prison and at a rescue mission in Nashville itself, accompanied on some tracks by the remnants of the Carter Family (Anita, Helen and Maybelle), and by the church congregations as well... In addition, there are several bit of sermons and sermon-like introductions by various pastors... This disc has a level of religious authenticity that you don't often hear on country records, particularly ones by big, famous stars. Might be a bit much for the casual listener, but gospel fans will really be impressed by the apparent depth of Merle's convictions."
4,Near perfect,"I have not found a pen I like better. Simple. Retractable. Hard, slender and comfortable for me - not thick, soft and gummy (yuck). Can sometime smudge a little the first time it is used, but otherwise near perfect."
2,Disappointing,The pen failed to work after I had laid it on a table for two days. the ink had seeped to the bottom of the supply tube.
3,"Pilot Better Retractable Ballpoint Pen, Fine Point, Blue Tinted Barrel",Pretty good little pen. Smooth writing nothing outstanding. I would prefer a little larger point but for the price it's a good pen.
5,Only pen of choice,"Been using this model of pen for close to 15 years, I love the fine point and dependability. These pens seem to be harder to obtain find due to the new style of gel pens. The black pens are model 30000 and I found Pilot makes a fine blue ink pen model 30001. I am going to buy a couple boxes of each."
1,I dont like this pen,I have used this pen and i don't like it. It smear and it have to much ink coming out from the tip.
5,favorite,"My agency uses these pens, however they are about to start using 1 pen for all departments. I requested this pen, however it was not approved. I searched the internet trying to get this particular pen. Even the office stores carry a limited qty."
3,I love these pens!!,"I have always liked these pens and I was having a hard time finding them at the local and even larger office supply stores up here. At first I thought that I had been shipped a bunch of dud pens, but they just needed to thaw out. Thanks for supplying me with my favorite pen."
3,"A good pen. Not great, but good.","As ball-point pens go, these are pretty good.The writing is smooth. I have not had any blobs of ink come out of the pen (which occurs with other ball-points).It didn't exactly change my pen paradigm or anything. It's a good pen. I prefer this kind over others of the same type."
5,My favorite pen ever!,"Since I can no longer purchase these pens at our local stores, I was thrilled to find some on line!They are easy to hold, the writing is fine and smooth. This is a great pen!"
4,ink pen,I have used fine point pens for years and this is the best one that I have ever owned. I buy nothing else anymore.
5,Best DVD Concert I have ever watched,"I am addicted to this DVD. I just wish that they sold ALL of the songs from this DVD in CD format, so I could listen to them in the car.The songs and the musicians are beautiful and genuine, and Eddie Vedder singing ""Stuff and Nonsense"" ...... heavens.I didn't know Neil Finn too well before this DVD, but now I have a great deal of respect and appreciation for him."
2,o.k. dvd,This dvd is o.k. but not even close to the Worlds Collide dvd. I guess I expected Crowded House and was left unsatisfied.
4,Pretty dang okay.,"It stays where it should, it's easy to adjust.The only thing that annoys me is that you can't get it centered, it will always be a little off to the side because of how it's designed, but it's fine if your chair is comfortable to sit off center in, it's perfect."
1,Repetitive,"Repetitive,repetitive,repetitive. Although the book offers some empirical evidence of the effects of praying on healing, the author Goes on and on about a point already made. One feels he is just trying to write enough to fill up a book. I was surprised (and annoyed) that a man of scientific background would jump to one conclusion from a series of data and seemingly wind around to another conclusion with the same data. Half of the book is annotated notes and quotes from other authors--again to fill up the book.I couldn't wait to read this after hearing Oprahs interview with the author. I couldn't wait to finish the book because it was so ill written."
4,ALICE A UNIQUE LEGEND,GOES TO HELL IS ONE GREAT ALBUM WITH MELODIC BALLAD TUNES THAT CAN MAKE A PRINCESS CRY FOR MORE!!!
2,To Hell and Back,"This album was to be the follow-up to the sensational ""Welcome To My Nightmare"", but it does not deserve to even stand in Nightmare's shadow.There is always the argument that this recording was one large demented joke where the citizens of Hell are forced to dance to disco music (You Gotta Dance), but unless you are hot on the idea of listening to Alice's disco songs, do NOT buy this album. The songs ""Go To Hell"" and ""Guilty"" are worthy of note because in them, Alice pokes fun at his own shock rock lifestyle. (""You're something that never should have happened""and ""I'm a dirt-talkin', whisky-drinkin', woman-chasin' minister's son"" respectively.) Although it may have a sence of humor, especially for hard-core fans, it lacks in almost everything else. If you need an alternative, I would suggest you look to ""Welcome to My Nightmare"" or ""From The Inside""instead."
2,Pretty weak for Alice.,"Don't know what it is about this album, but aside from the ""title track"", I've never seen any other standout tracks. It's seems a bit uninspired."
2,ITS HELL ALRIGHT.,"This is the WORST Cooper album of the 70's. I can't stand it. Aside from the tracks GO TO HELL and I""M GOING HOME, maybe CHASING RAINBOWS, everthing on this album is a miss. The production is worse than the music. This is one of the worst production jobs ever. The rockers are poorly written and lame. And DISCO! A low point in the career of a musical genius as evidenced by FROM THE INSIDE and KILLER, and a bunch of others I could mention. Even LACE AND WHISKEY tops this with ease. Be honest and stop overrating this lame album."
2,Check out the back cover...Alice taking another step down into career hell!,"Where do you start with this record? Mercy. A corny record overall. Again, if you read my ""Welcome to my Nightmare"" review and trust it, this album is a few steps down from that effort. While there is some nice guitar work on this album, I can't get past the stupid lyrics. So many, nudge-nudge, wink-wink passages. And while I understand the humor, it just gets to sound like your old drunken uncle telling you the same corny story over and over. Alice Cooper always had humor in some songs...just not EVERY song ALL of the time.To me the best rocker is ""Guilty"". Great guitars and a pretty cool song. ""I Never Cry"" is a great ballad. Nice song. But seriously folks, that's about it. Alice singing ""I'm Always Chasing Rainbows""??? Chuck Berris should've gonged him right then and there."
3,Could of been better,"This of course was a record by someone who had a gimmick long before Kiss had a record deal. The shock rock master put the stage show first and went with a produced record that backed up this story/stage show making the record a musical score for the some what Broadway show Alice put on. The production is very glossy and the songs here worked better live and live gave these songs more of an edge. Not to say that this record hasn't great moments, because it does. I Never Cry, Go to Hell, and I'm the Coolest are all fine, but the real show stopper with some of the best guitar work from any Alice Cooper recording can be heard on ""Wish You Were Here.""Not a must but not a miss either it does have great moments it just could have been better."
3,Cooper Keeps Having Nightmares And We Love It!!!,"This was actually the first Alice album I heard. I became an Alice nut in 1980 but a friend let me here this 1976 release. I like the album but not as much as Welcome To My Nightmare. The title track is great and I love ""Guilty."" However the album is surprisingly not that scary and while it is good I personally think he has better albums. Worth buying though."
4,Great Album,"I loved it. I love the songs ""Go to Hell', ""Give teh Kid a Break"" and ""Guilty"". The song ""I'm always chasing rainbows"" is very touching and somewhat bittersweet. Alice is great a concept album maker, much like Pink Floyd were. Very interesting idea. Alice Cooper is just a great artist."
2,Album Lives Up To Its Name,"Many found this album as one of The Coop's greatest offerings, however I found it as his biggest disappointment. If not for the title track, Guilty, and Wish You Were Here, the album would be a total flop. The rest of the songs were written with a mellow twist and lack the classic hard-rocking Cooper sound. It's a Cooper album that is much different than any other, but not in a good sense. When listening to the album straight though, the span after Go To Hell ends until Guilty begins is almost endless. Cooper somewhat rebounded with Lace and Whiskey which has more definitvie Cooper tunes, even though the album is not a popular pick for Cooper fans. Go to Hell is probably a better album to listen to if you're strung out on something."
2,Alice vs. the cast of Grease II,"I am a fan of the man, lets be clear on that, however I do actually listen to the music. This collection of songs is theme based like so many cooper albums, which can help you to try and ""get into"" the music. Vocally, Alice just sounds tired, there is no real attack or depth of emotion and the production and instramentation is very ""Grease II"" yes, Grease II (the Original Grease is actually more interesting than this record) If an Alice Cooper fan is using Grease as a reference point to review a record proceed with caution..."
5,This Is The Coolest,"Looking at the earlier reviews of this album I noticed that there are only two opinionos possible about this album, whether you like or you spit on it. In fact this is a great album. I think those who dislike the tracks on this album are comparing them to much with the School's Out or Billion Dollar Babies albums wich were Basic Rock albums. Goes To Hell is more a Symphonic Rock album. If you like earlier Cooper songs such as Sun Arise, Blue Turk, Hello Hooray, or Some Folks, you're gonna love this one."
5,Disco is hell...,"While the rest of the world stayed alive with night fever, Alice Cooper dished out his own brand of disco from the satanic perspective. At least on ""You Gotta Dance,"" anyway. The rest of this album features heavier rock than its predecessor, Welcome To My Nightmare, while maintaining a joyful concept presence. ""Go To Hell"" kicks starts our decent to hell, while ""Guilty,"" and ""Wish You Were Here"" provide much aggression. ""I Never Cry"" and ""Wake Me Gently"" soften the tale, and ""Going Home"" wraps things up safely. Overall, a great ride.Notes: ""Wake Me Gently"" is #4 on my all time favorite songs list. For another great trip through hell, check out Burnt Offerings by Iced Earth."
4,journey to hell,"Alice Cooper goes to hell is the follow up to the all time classic, ""Welcome to my nightmare"" and it is a very good record, but not as good as ""Welcome"". ""Goes to hell"" is another concept album by coop, which in general marks out the period 75-78. The hell-trip wasn't really that exiting that I hoped for. The album is very ""rock-opera-theater""-like and maybe it has most obvios ""concept-feel"" to it of all albums he've done when listened to it. The songs goes into different landscapes and the feel is very visual. There are many slow and soft songs on this album. The only really heavy rock song is ""Go to hell"". There are of course some more rock n roll songs here but not in the same great standard as the rock n roll songs on ""Welcome"". There are great ballads on this one, maybe the best element on the records varity of styles example (wake me gently, i never cry and goin home). The album grows with every listening but I would only recomand this one to the more die-hard alice fans."
5,Alice's Best 70's Solo!,"This my favorite Alice Cooper solo album from the 1970's. It is a much, much better concept recording than ""Welcome to My Nightmare."" Alice Cooper does indeed go to hell in this story, but the ending reminds me of Jimmy Stewart's classic film, ""It's a Wonderful Life. The songs are just incredible! Great rockers. Beautiful ballads. Some very, very funny songs. Some very moving songs like, ""Wake Me Gently."" All styles of music are here....and they are all fantastic! Don't pass it up! A classic!"
5,There is a reason Alice is a legend...,"Cooper is the king of art/glam rock, and has influenced acts from David Bowie to KISS to Maryln Manson. He went solo in the mid 70s, and GOES TO HELL is perhaps the best work he released in that time. This is a clever concept album based on a story where Alice, uh, goes to to hell. Songs like We Gotta Dance, Didn't We Meet?, and Going Home are still strong over 20 years after they were first recorded. Do yourself a favor, and check out the powerful music and amusing lyrics (keep in mind that ""I'm The Coolest"" is sung from the devil's point of view!) that make Alice more than just a singer in face paint. There is so much more to this guy than the wonderfully bizarre theatrics!"
5,Sounds great!,"Alice did not make anything better than albums in 1975, 1976 and 1977. So this is one of his best products. Highly recommended."
4,"hot pads, hot pan holders","These are typical of these silicone pads. I have several different sizes and shapes, now. They are stiff at first, but become somewhat more pliable. The color is very nice. A nice, muted yellow, more like the fading yellow of autumn fields. They work very well for my needs - hoisting big pans full of meat or roasting vegetables. They also make nice hot pads on the cabinet top for smaller hot dishes. I really like these silicone cooking utensils for their ease of cleaning. They never have to sit around stained and crusty like my old cloth pan holders did. Just rinse, use a little soapy water when needed and dry."
3,Seemed like a good idea,"Perhaps it's just me, but I just can't get used to these. While they are effective in the heat-proof department, and I've taken to using them as trivets, the silicone just can't wrap around a pot handle the way my trusty terry-cloth pot holders can."
4,Good quality,"I bought these because I wanted silicone trivets, but it was cheaper to get a set of potholders. Actually I haven't seen any that are cheaper, especially since you mostly only have the option of buying one at a time. I love that they double as potholders, trivets, and jar openers. I wasn't convinced they'd make a good jar opener, but I tried it and they work! I gave the product four stars only because as trivets I don't think they are the best looking to have on your dining table."
2,Nothing at all like the picture!,"The picture is of a tan or sand color which would go well with the colors of my granite counter tops. I was sent bright sunflower yellow instead which is a pretty color - but not what I want. They do not grip pots well but make good trivets. I already had some of the dark blue but ordered 3 sets of these because they would look much better with the colors in my kitchen. Well, they would if they were the color shown... :("
2,Color is not as represented,"Well, I relied on the color in the picture plus reviewer indication that the color was ""muted."" That is exactly what I wanted but not what I received. My pot holders are traffic light yellow, that is, decidedly bright, definitely not pastel or muted, but not completely neon either. I know that I could have returned these to Amazon because the color was not as represented; Amazon would have taken them back postage free on my side and either refunded or replaced. However, they are functional, i.e., heat resistant to 500 degrees F, skid and slip resistant, and dishwasher safe, and I can put them to a ton of uses. Frankly, though, I was just too lazy to go to the bother of the return process, i.e., boxing them back up, requesting a free postage return label, tracking the package and return/refund. Just know that there is a likelihood that you will not get the subdued yellow color shown and that they will be bright yellow."
3,Not true to color in the picture posted with the item.,"The silicone pot holders are a bright yellow, not the muted yellow/tan color in the pictures. Other than color, they are as advertised. I have many silicone pot holders, and love their easy clean up and functionality - I just wish these were the color that was pictured (bright yellow didn't go as well with the towels I had bought). I purchased this set over another set because the yellow pictured appeared to better match a prior purchase; I could've saved a little money on the set that was true to color of yellow."
2,Not Heat Proof,"I had been looking for these potholders for quite sometime and was pleased to get them but I'm quite disappointed. They are too thin to absorb the heat for long, only moments really. If you have to hold a hot pan from the oven more than a few moments the heat comes through and you'll get burned. They need to be thicker."
4,Despair and Humility,"This is essential for any Fassbinder aficionado. However, the copy editing is very sloppy and needs to be revised."
2,Machine not as advertised,"I bought this machine from a 3rd party (rugbykingpin) through the Amazon Website. This machine DID NOT perform as listed and never did sew right on anything more than light fabric. I tried to return it but, this merchant WOULD not allow a return for ANYTHING but what they considered defective. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS MERCHANT if you are NOT entirely sure about the product you are buying. I attempted to leave poor feedback and removed it, because I had mispelled a word and found out that I cound NOT leave feedback again or change anything!!! Kind of scammy I think."
3,380 Denim Sewing Machine,Sews great but had problems with bobbin winder not working properly. Needed to lubricate winder to get it to work.
1,A denim don't,"Horrible! Claims to sew through denim, but didn't come anywhere close. This machine fell apart in 2 days. If you have mulitple layers or thick fabric to sew, don't rely on this one!"
5,Great pictures and behind-the-scenes info,"Besides the complete script and some wonderful production photos, what makes this edition so special are Mel Brooks' ""hand written"" notes off to the side. Inserted throughout the text, they tell great behind-the-scenes anecdotes about lines that were cut or revised out-of-town, things that happened in rehearsal, and the show's evolution from film to stage musical."
2,ALWAYSKINK.,"When I unroll this hose from the reel, it gets around 10 kinks throughout. The kinks are impossible to shake out and prevent the water from traveling through. I'm forced to straighten the whole hose (100 feet!) to get at the kinks. I paid 42 dollars & 89 cents for this item from Amazon in September 2007 and I'm now looking to buy a replacement hose. I see the price is now over 60 dollars, which is outrageous and I'm hoping to save someone a regrettable purchase with my review. The only reason I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1 is because the couplings work well & do not leak."
4,Good stuff,"This album is extremely hard to find. I don't think it's on itunes and you won't stumble across these guys often in a record store. If you like Louvin Bros, you'll like this. Check it out!"
5,One of Cream's better efforts,"This is definitely one of Cream's better compilations. I've been to Cream in Liverpool a number of times over the years, and own many of the previous CD offerings; but I tend to to think that more often than not, the club does not do itself justice.However, this double CD is superb - and a good representation of the kinds of tunes you can expect to hear at Cream. It's interesting to note that although it claims to be ""future trance""many of the tracks are in fact new mixes of very old tunes! (""Highlander"" by Taste Experience is at least four years old - but a quality track all the same even if I do prefer the original mix!)Definitely recommend you buy this!"
4,Of very good historical value,"Thoroughly enjoyed reading each chapter of Mr.James' book. I would suggest it for anyone having an interest in the old West, the mining periods, and personnae of the same, and perhaps just as importantly to gain some insightful information behind the storefornt facades and adits of Virginia City. The author has provided much background behind the legends, pulled down to earth other ""legends"" and truly given this ""tourist site"" it's legitmate and historical due. I am anxious to visit the Lake Tahoe area once again and take that little jaunt over the hill to visit a now-less-mysterious Virginia City."
2,A great Warner Olan film,"An excellent chan film. lots of mystery. a little soft ed on quinine which was indeed used for various ailments back in the olden days. I agree with another reader about Warner Olan on DVD.I have purchased budget dvd's with 2,3 or 4 programs on one DVD and I would suspect the right medium could do the same with some of the chan films."
4,CHARLIE CHAN TO THE RESCUE...,"This is an entertaining Charlie Chan mystery with Warren Oland in the lead role. It seems that seven years ago, Alan Colby, the heir to an immense fortune, disappeared while at sea. His body was never found. He suddenly reappears with a plausible explanation for his seeming disappearance, ready to claim his inheritance. No sooner does he return, however, he is murdered.It appears that members of the Lowell family have been living off his inheritance for the past seven years, thinking Alan Colby dead. They have been using his fortune to fund psychic research. It is they who stand to lose the most from his return. They stand only to gain by his death. Or is the murderer the crooked family lawyer? Could it be the creepy family caretaker? Who killed Alan Colby? Watch the film and find out. If you are not a fan of Charlie Chan, deduct one star from my rating."
1,Charlie Chan's Secret,"Although this is the only Charlie Chan I did not appreciate, the place that sent the product gave excellent service.I am not sure about the what the star rating belongs to, the sender or the product."
2,too complicated steps. no detailed instruction.,the steps are too complicated to follow. this video is for the really advanced professional dancers. for those who are beginners do not buy this video. you will just be frustrated because it is hard to follow and the steps are taught too fast.
5,Not just another Didgeridoo,We love the new addition to our musical instrument collection and this piece is as much art as it is an instrument.
1,Does not suck. Literally.,"But does suck in the colloquial sense.This thing is useless for picking up liquids, which was the primary reason I got it. The little rubber squeegee tip you are supposed to use doesn't really seem to help.If you only intend to use it on dry stuff, I guess it'd be okay.I returned it the next day."
2,one scary product,"I got this about a year ago and it was working fine until last month. The motor started rotate too fast and it makes big noises. It seems like it's gonna explode anytime. Guys, don't buy this item."
1,toxic dust buster,"This dustbuster comes with the following warning in the instruction manual:""This product contains chemicals, including lead, known to the State of California to cause cancer, and birth defects or other reproductive harm. Wash hands after handling.""Obviously this product is not safe for adults let alone children. I wonder what other toxic substances are in this product besides the lead? It's shameful that a company like Black & Decker tries to (and does) get away with this kind of corner cutting."
3,later crusader,"A more timely publishing would have made a big difference to me. At least it's not as ironic as ralph nader's political guidance being doled out to us-when, november 30, after the big one? it's hard to come down on the media (un)coverage when really influential leaders can't get their (private sector)publishers acts together! Still, I would like another copy of this book to forward to a friend, and don't be put off by my 3 starr rating- I am a bit of a civil cynic!"
2,I am a Lynch fan... but couldn't finish this one.,"Some of David Lynch's movies are among my all-time favorites - Mulholland Drive to name one. Inland Empire was way too fragmented, and frankly it felt lazy. A lot of sloppy camera shots, sequences that moved too slowly, this film had a lot of unfocused moments that made me feel bored. I did not finish the movie. I give it 2 stars instead of 1 simply because there are a few good moments that I did enjoy."
4,Four Stars for Audacity,"Inland Empire is perhaps the most obtuse movie David Lynch has made since Eraserhead. In many ways it is a triumph of the imagination and admirable for its total disregard of Hollywood convention. However, this is the first Lynch film (and I've seen them all) where my attention began to lag and my fingers were sorely tempted by the fast-forward button. Although this movie contains a plethora of dark and wonderful elements, the whole does not equal the sum of the parts. I think the ultimate problem is the story lacks a compelling central character. About halfway through the movie I ceased to care what happened to Laura Dern, in any of her incarnations. Also, while the movie is laden with the sense of mystery and forboding that is a Lynch trademark, it quickly loses any effect because there is never any payoff. Inland Empire is in many ways a summary of every theme or device Lynch has employed in the past. Until he creates his next masterpiece, it will have to do."
2,Ugh...what is this about?,"I love David Lynch, but this was just too long and convoluted a series for me to understand or stick with, unfortunately."
4,Rabbit audience,"The more complex and longest Lynch movie.I it was hilarious how people at the local theater i went out to see this movie whith a friend of mine, exit the room one by one, poor people i will do the same if i went out to see a teenage movie or shrek.This is a movie that gives you free interpretation, if you expect to have a linear story, with a meaning, you are lost. It kept my mind in full for about 2 days, and at the end realize a way to ""understand"" this film on my own."
1,an argument winner for the anti-lynch brigade,"I once had an argument with some friends who detested The Beatles. I love them - even an earlier, deceptively simple song like 'Please Please Me' is sheer melodic genius. These friends thought their 'argument winner' was ""Ok...what about 'Ob La Di, Ob La Da' then, huh?!"".Hmmm... 'Inland Empire' is David Lynch's 'Ob La Di, Ob La Da' - lousy output from a very fine artist. I loved the intrigue of 'Lost Highway', and 'Mulholland Drive' still haunts me. But with 'Inland Empire' the riddles and twists left me absolutely cold. The Lynch ingredients are there but the cake just doesn't rise. I guess it's what can happen when the usual budgetary constraints of film-making are lessened to a large degree by the opportunity to shoot digitally. Discipline and restraint can go out the window as the director gets carried away with his new-found 'freedom'.Quite liked the rabbit sitcom though.... One star for that."
1,Razzie of all raspberries,"This was the worst movie I've ever seen. Boring doesn't come close. Disjointed, ridiculous, plotless, ugly. UGH. Not in the same class with Twin Peaks or Mulholland Drive. This doesn't even seem like the same director that made those movies. Weirder than weird this one was."
2,Whats the Point?,I am a big David Lynch fan but this film is nonsence. Yep sure David is once again delving into the subconcious and dream states but he has done it before and better. At least in films like Mulholland Drive you can follow the film to some degree and try and peel back the mystery. Inland Empire is purely a nonsensical opportunity for David Lynch to throw as many of his weirdo ideals and artistry into the one film and not care about any structure or form. At three hours in length and moving at the pace of a sloth this film is truly an endurance test which is quite frankly not worth the effort. Save your crazy stuff for your art shows Dave and get back to making films like Blue Velvet and Wild at Heart which prove how much better a discernable plotline can be.
1,Let's hope the rabbits don't breed.............,".........and produce another film like this one. As usual, you think you are following along with the film (despite the rabbits in the room scene) and, all of a sudden, it degenerates in a long winded, confusing, boring series of unrelated and unconnected drivel.The movie was billed as a horror in the International Film Festival I saw it in. The only horror part in the movie was when I suddenly had this scary thought that it would never end.I should have been warned off when I saw the 2 clues ""David Lynch"" and ""Surreal"" but no, I thought, ""nothing could be as bad as Mulholland Drive""One could make better use of 3 hours by staring blankly at nothing."
1,"Unlike all the 5 star reviews, I'm not pretending to enjoy this so I look smart...","This is up there as one of the WORST movies I've ever seen. The only reason I finished this rubish was I figured it had to go somewhere, hell he had three hours! If you want to make a movie about the evils of Hollywood then do it, don't make some rubbish that feels like your viewing it through the eyes of an 8 year old with A.D.D. who forgot to take his meds. Trust me, this movie couldn't get any worse. My only explination for these 5 star reviews is I think people are trying to look all arty and smart when in reality its just a mess. They should include a third disc with this DVD, one where he applogises for making this movie and more so for your having watched it."
1,"The story so far........,",There are some people in a large room who are talking about something. Then I pressed 'stop.'I do love Lynch - but not this much!
1,3 HOURS OF RANDOM BORINGNESS,"It took me 3 weeks or more to watch this movie. I got it based in fact that it was done by David Lynch who had directed alot of amazing films especially eraserhead. Dont watch this unless you an ""art wanker""."
5,really trippy,"In spite of the fact that even actors from the film had no idea what it was about, this is a great piece of work by David Lynch. Very open to interpretation on a number of levels-some of which we'll never attain."
4,I wish it was a story...,"There are many good things going in Inland Empire, but the movie lacks form. Rather, it lacks decision. Should Lynch try this again, let's hope for four or five really good short pieces which complete themselves. After Mulholland Drive, I had high hopes for this one. I was excited when I saw the bunnies in the preview; the gorgeous Polish drawing room thrilled me in the first part; the crazy old lady; the cigarette and silk. But what became of it? A run-on (and on, and on, and on.) Now; I'll say I love the whole thing and wish that it could be five stars. But even though I love it, my values and judgement will not allow me to give it this rating.For Lynch completists only. David, if I may be so bold, give us another Blue Velvet, aother Mulholland, another Elephant Man, another Eraserhead for Chrissake! But not this installation piece, please! It's a movie, not a museum. But Laura Dern, why, she amazes me always."
1,Surreal sludge,"I love David Lynch. I love Twin Peaks; favorite series ever. I love Dune; favorite SciFi movie ever. So it hit me hard that this movie was such a complete and utter failure. I feel I have been robbed of the price of the movie, of three hours of my life, and it was done by a friend. This movie was beyonbd disjointed, it was shattered. It exercised wierdness not to set mood or advance plot, but just to be wierd. Save your money and pray the next offering shows Lynch's old promise."
3,More Doppelgängers in Hollywood,"Inland Empire is an overlong, shaggy mess that plays like a rough draft ofMulholland Drive. His other movies have done the same thing better, but there's enough good material in here to keep fans happy."
2,"Baffling, Confusing, Incomprehensible","Truly the most challenging movie I've ever seen. I was baffled and confused. Why couldn't I understand what was going on? Where was the plot? WHAT was the plot? The movie seemed to be about something, and then it wasn't. It was moody, atomospheric, dreamlike, surreal, and extemely disturbing. I was intrigued at first, and then finally, in the end, just angry for wasting so much of my time and energy on it. I searched for the meaning of it, and read some things that helped me, although not much. But seriously if one has to go through all that trouble to make any sense of a film they just watched---well, then this is the perfect film for you! Good luck and don't say you weren't warned."
2,"An incomprehensible, pretentious BORE (must be all caps)...","I've been blown away by Mulholland Drive. It's fun when a director doesn't pander to an audience and lays the clues out for the individual to piece together. But, in the aforementioned movie, there was a semblance of a plot, even if it's chopped up and moved around a bit. This is nothing more than a rush of imagery with nothing coherent holding it together. Lynch lets us into his head, but not his heart. It's difficult to feel anything when he only shows us random images, strong colors and chaos, with nothing, in my mind, that glues them together. In fact, for someone that loves to indict Hollywood, he sure seems obsessed with LaLa Land. And that's already been done and done better (see Mulholland Drive). He's finally went too far down the rabbit hole!!! Fun as hallucinatory dada, but not much else..."
2,Bloated Lynch Film,"With some major editing this could have been an awesome movie. I love lynch and there are some very interesting scenes. It's just too long to endure. If you are a Lynch fan it's probably till worth checking out, but it is badly flawed in my opinion."
2,Absurda,"I have been a David Lynch fan for many years, but having seen this film knowing nothing about it beforehand, except the fact that Lynch wrote and directed it, I can understand why he named the company responsible for its production ""Absurda."" The film certainly has some memorable (and sinister) scenes, but taken as a whole, it appears to be an example of theater of the absurd with elements of Grand Guignol. Some reviewers seem to have embraced an emperor's new clothes perspective in their comments, which may amuse Mr. Lynch if he ever reads them.By the way, William H. Macy appears briefly (although uncredited) as a TV announcer.One of the noteworthy extras on the second disk is a short film of Lynch cooking quinoa with broccoli, and telling a strange - and absurd - story about traveling by train from Greece through Yugoslavia to Venice.I would advise potential viewers to rent this film (preferably from a library) before investing money to buy it."
2,Inland Empire,"What has happened to David Lynch? I'm loath to say that sometimes it may be best for an artist to be restricted by producers and executives because, in this self-distributed venture, Lynch has left the planet. ""Inland Empire"" makes ""Eraserhead"" or ""Mulholland Drive"" or even ""Lost Highway"" look like ""Just My Luck"" because it hasn't the slightest degree of cohesion.[...]"
2,Profoundly Disappointed,"Even by David Lynchian standards this was a convoluted, incomprehensible mess. After enduring nearly 3 hours of jumbled vignettes of disjointed scenes, many in camera obscura, many in Polish, and many with people wearing donkey heads (??or mouse heads), with an obligato of blaring, jarring noises, I finally succumbed to the inevitable: this is simply not good. Lynch is making too many demands upon this humble viewer. I know. I know. It's phantasmagorical, artistic genius that I've just witnessed. Well, maybe. But nevertheless it was not in the least understandable nor, for that reason primarily, enjoyable.I watch movies in the main to be entertained, sometimes educated. This opus did neither. I came away bored and dissatisfied. I felt like I had just been privy to someone's psychotic nightmare."
2,Why? why? why?,"This isn't really a movie. It's more like an abstract video with a bare semblance of 'plot.' It does have a cool, ominous soundtrack. Clearly, this is an art film, meant to be looked at and contemplated, not necessarily enjoyed as entertainment. For me, it just wasn't worth the effort. Watch if you are a dire fan of David Lynch only."
1,Like a bad parody of a David Lynch film,"Just awful. A series of surreal vignettes with no meaningful connection. Laura Dern looks very confused; she must have tried reading the (nonexistent) script. And while it's true she plays 'confused' very well, that doesn't carry the film. David Lynch finally made a boring film."
4,Not his strongest but still great!,"David Lynch is a true cinematic genius. That said, I will say that this is not his strongest work, but that doesn't mean this film is bad, or not worth the time. Quite the contrary. I just simply walked out of the theater thinking that it could have been about 30 minutes shorter. But even if this film misfires a little. It is still way more interesting engrossing than 90 % of all the films that come out today. If you where new to David Lynch I would probably reccomend ""Mullholland Drive"" to you. But those who are already familiar will want to own ""Inland Empire""."
5,The english subtitles are THERE,"You have to enable the closed caption, it is called ""CC1"".Works in WinDVD 8."
3,Bizarre,"David Lynch has always had a flare for the bizarre, but this movie is over the top. For hard core David Lynch fans, this movie is a must - for others, it's not critical to have in your library."
2,I think I'll stick to Blue Velvet,"Somehow I made it through the 3hr marathon called Inland Empire. As confusing and bizarre as Lost Highway and Mulholland Drive were, at least those films were interesting, in a bizarre and creepy way. This film, Inland Empire, was creepy, but not all that interesting. Can something be creepy and boring at the same time? Mr. Lynch has done it. (and Blue Velvet is one of my all-time favorite films). Maybe I'll need to see it again, maybe in a year, but I can see why no theater screened this one (not even the so-called art cinemas). 2 stars because I still respect David Lynch as an artist. Speaking of ""straight "" films, anybody remember the ""Straight Story"", directed by Lynch?"
2,Too Long,"Three solid hours of nonsensical, esoteric allusions to reincarnation. It grapples with the deep truth that our current lives can be likened to a needle stuck in a record groove as our dormant spirits go through life in a vulgar body entriely unaware that we are treading the same doomed path we have trod time and time before; only in this film Laura Dern seems to lose the comfort of that unawareness and all her lives start playing out at once.It is so abstract and goes on for so long it gets nigh on impossible to enjoy. Also, much like Twin Peaks, it offers no hope or positive energy, only an overwhelming sense of the all-consuming, dark void over which we have no control, making for a very bleak and unforgiving experience.Not one to watch on a Saturday night with a bowl of popcorn."
3,ok it's David Lynch but I think it has to grow on me.,"I knew what I was buying: I read the other reviews, I read all Rotten Tomatoes reviews and I took the risk. Ok it is a David Lynch movie. It has a perfect performance by Laura Dern...Jeremy Irons is there...all is weird...but what's wrong? or am I wrong? yeah maybe I am wrong, I forgot Lynch has all those meta languages. Well If I want to get entertained this is crap, but I just have to be trapped by David' world...so I will give it another try. In the meantime I have to be honest: It didn't satisfy me ad Mulholland Drive or Blue Velvet ,or Wild at Heart, or ok Twin Peaks.This one is really heavy, but I think the trick is to try it at small doses. Good luck!"
5,'the experience' that is INLAND EMPIRE,"You're not going to find anyone sitting on the fence here, but if your idea of a great movie is one that you can't shake, and one you want to return to again and again...this is it. very scary!!!!!!!!"
3,no dimensions provided,Its interesting that on a lot of these decals there are no dimensions provided... how are we expected to evaluate the purchase without that information?
4,A must for beginning scientists,"Peter Goodwins experiments and projects range from simplistic to more diverse, in which many projects can be made by a young scientist (age 12 - 18). Although physics is not a subject that many like while in school, the projects present excellent challenges to the theories taught in school. This book is great for those looking for interesting but easy projects, that if followed exactly will produce winning results."
1,Something's Missing,"I give this book one star only because of how it was formatted for Kindle.I downloaded the Kindle edition of this book and it was full of missing ingredients and directions, such as in the Bird's Nest Boureg, the ingredients read:/4 lb. Monterey Jack cheese, grated egg/4 lb. feta cheese, crumbled/2 C. minced parsleyRed bell pepper squares, for garnish DOUGH:lb. filo doughC. clarified butterI feel cheated because the recipes all look good, but who knows how much of each ingredient is needed with the Kindle edition. Please, someone fix this SOON!!"
1,Useless until corrected. Ingredient Quantities are Missing/Incomplete.,"What a disappointment. As Lynn from Ohio mentioned in the last review, quantities of ingredients are missing/incomplete. What you see in the ""sample"" is exactly what you get once you have purchased this Kindle version.Sometimes the sample is flawed but then after purchase, it downloads/displays correctly. But that didn't happen here. Clearly an oversight in the formatting, one that I hope will be corrected very soon.My great-aunt was of Armenian descent and so many of these recipes bring back memories. But I'll just have to wait patiently for now. I will revise my rating once I receive the corrected version."
1,Kindle edition needs a format fix!,"This review is on the formatting issues on the Kindle. As other reviewers have pointed out, there are missing numbers on many recipes so it is impossible to get correct amounts. It is as if the number ""1"" has been removed throughout the text.... Quote: ""The basic recipe was brought to America by my grandmother in 899. I have made over 000,000 dolmas using this method."" Plus the paragraph formatting lumps everything together and doesn't leave space between recipes. Enough said.I love Armenian food and would love to be able to make some of these recipes, but cannot trust the quantities. Please Amazon and the authors of this cookbook, please get the formatting issues fixed!"
2,Work fine but packages are all short some washers,These did the job as expected but each package (of 4) was missing 5-8 washers. Ordered 100 but got around 75 or only 3 packs worth.
1,"NOT ""Extra Large""","These are standard 1 inch diameter plaster washers. There is nothing ""Extra Large"" about these washers. I'm sure they will work fine for standard plaster repair, but that's not what I was looking for. The product description is deceiving."
4,"If you are looking for an intro book, go somewhere else","This is definitely an advanced book on practice. To learn meditation out of this book is not recommended --- the author lived in the 13th century. Reading this book gives insights, realizations, and wonderful ideas on the practice of meditation to those who have a grounding in the process."
4,Listen to Dogen Zenji,"Listen to Dogen Zenji's dharma with this book. The writings of this master are timeless. Not easy to read - requires some effort, but there are morsals of teachings buried within.Ed"
3,the camera can get annoying,"though the camera work is not as bad as Vai's Astoria, it still changes too much just when you're getting comfortable watching an angle.. I find that it's not so bad on every song, but it could be a lot more friggin still. But maybe it can't be that way because they're afraid it won't sell enough. Aside from the camera hassles, the music and performance rocks!"
1,MORE IDIOT CAMERA WORK!!!!!,"is very rarely a shot that lasts over five seconds. The formula issomething like(seconds per shot)3,2,1,1,2,3,2,1...etc.somebody send my 14 year old kid to film shows, he would do better!what IS with the constant idiotic concert dvd's like this, one after another after another"
1,"We DO NOT need ANOTHER LIVE DVD, Joe!!","How many cd's/dvd's do we need with largely the same songs? Yes, this does contain ""new songs"" from the last cd that I haven't heard ""live"" but the remaining 20 or so songs are just the same old stuff.Note to Joe: DVD can be used to showcase more than Live performances. Do something ELSE like take a camera with you when you record your next album, or ANYTHING ELSE! If I hear Flying in a Blue Dream, The Extremist, Cool #9, Satch Boogie or the other 7-10 same old songs again I'll cry. Or..... have a LIVE CD/DVD with ALL NEW SONGS that have never been played on the other dvd's or rarely at all. How about the Phone Call? Up in the Sky? Mind Storm? Starry Night? As a listener, as much as I love his stuff I would, as a BUYER, like to think I'm buying something NEW!! How in the world can we be expected to need ANOTHER live version of Surfing with the G.D. Alien?"
1,VIDEO EDITED BY A NOVICE,"LIVE IN SAN FRANCISCO IS THE BEST VIDEO, BUT THIS IS NOT SO GOOD, PUBLISHED BY A NOVICE. TO PUBLISH A VIDEO OF JOE SATRIANI IS VERY SIMPLE: TO FOLLOW ALL THE SHORT WHILE JOE SATRIANI, WHEN IT DOES A SINGLE ONE WE WANT TO SEE THE SINGLE ONE, NEITHER TO THE BEAR, NOR TO I PUBLISH, NOR HIS BACK, ETC... I BELIEVE THAT MISTER JOE SATRIANI HAS TO SUPERVISE THESE THINGS."
4,CLASSIC JOE - TERRIBLE CAMERA WORK!,We all know Joe is the ultimate instrumentalist...its a shame a director to compliment him was NOT employed to work on this! Absolutely fantastic musicianship across the board but the distance shots when Joe is playing the solo on flying in a blue dream just does not do the music justice in any way shape or form.Next time Joe - PLEASE employ a decent director!! NUFF SAID!
5,Great Product,I have been using Liquid Health Energy & Stress for about 3 months - I feel good- I just feel better. I will probably never use tablet vitamins again - I also use the multiple vitamin liquid -
4,Liquid similar to B vitamin tablet,The product was delivered on-time and as described. I can't say that it seems as effective as B12 injections.
2,Only 200 mcg of B12,This B has only 200mcg of B-12 which is very low in order to feel the effects of B12 which is probably why one of the reviews (3rd) said that it's not as good as B12 shots. Most Bs have about 1000 mcg. B12.
4,4 STARS IF YOU LOVE STING,"Myself I love this album. Its a great driving or lounging album. You know, one of those that you let play from beginning to end. It goes back to an older era for sting. Dont expect pop like melodies and lyrics. Strong blues style(great for any live album in my opinion). Covers several police songs quite well. This album isn't for everyone though, I love sting so it works for me."
5,Excellent Rosicrucian Resource!,"I bought this book based on the above review, and at first, I was doubtful after I ordered it, but when it arrived, I was very, very glad I did! This is a beautiful oversized book, with many illustrations, and much information I have never seen before. I find the whole Rosicrucian movement fascinating, and this book has information you will not find anywhere else, to my knowledge. Get this book, it is worth the price. Also check out the ""Golden Game"". Another beautiful book but focusing more on 17th century alchemy in general."
5,Movado Women's Kara Watch #0605501,"We gave this watch to our daughter for Christmas. She is very, very pleased with it. It keeps excellent time and is a beautiful piece of jewelry. Thank you for offering it. I had searched and searched for one that I felt ""looked like her!"""
5,You can be free,"I really liked this book. It's easy to read and her stories are real clear. Alice shares in a way that hurting people of this world can be set free of their past. First Alice shares how as a child she was victimized and how she struggled with her abuse for years. But she doesn't stop there she goes on to skillfully explain how we can be free from the torment that has kept us bound all of our life. It really is a lie you know, we don't have to remain a victim! We can be set free. This book will help change your life."
5,A story to be reading,"First I have to say, it was a difficult story to read because is very raw story, but is worth completing the book, I was moved and touch by this beautiful true story, I congratulate the writer for being so open and honest about his life. The book has a powerful self respect and love message. I encourage everyone to read this book it doesnt matter if you are, gay or straight, the story has a universal languaje and has a lot teach us. Again praise to the Writer for this story.Josué"
5,Every(gay)man's Story,"""In the Arms of Adam"" is all of our stories, to one degree or another. Chronicling his life, dysfunctional family, being an outcast in school, coming out and finding a fulfilling life may not be unique but Chumbley has written a masterfully poignant and compelling tale of anguish and joy. While we all may identify, most of us cannot articulate the pains and strivings of a gay man seeking acceptance and reconciliation in a sometimes hostile, always confusing world."
2,"It does the job, but barely","This item works well with the smaller water bottles, but it is not big enough to hold the larger water bottles. Why would I put anything but the largest water bottle in this holder?"
1,Don't buy this stuff!,"We are long time Pfalzgraff folks and have not had problems in the past, but this line is now being manufactured in China and quality has gone down the tubes. Within a few months, the glaze has cracked and the dishes are discolored. This stuff is garbage, and an embarassment to an American company."
1,quality is very bad - thanks China :(,This set was completely inferior to the quality of the brand from the 80s and 90s. There are hairline cracks on many of the plates. They are thin and chip easily. I completely regret this purchase. I am planning on getting a USA made set this summer.
5,A Must Have!,"This book is a ""must have"" for every wife and mother! It's packed full of fun ideas to bring your family ""Back to the Table."" This book and its teachings have been such a blessing to our family -- they love coming home to dinner!I bought one for each of my daughters as wedding shower gifts. (Yes, 2 daughters married in one year!) Now, they are both bringing their husbands ""Back to the Table!.""Three families blessed by this wonderful book!Thanks a bunch, Dana Christine!"
5,Great Record!,"I'm an old head-banger, and not easily impressed my most of today's new music. This record rocks in any genre. It's heavy but hook-filled and uplifting. I'm having trouble keeping it out of my CD player...good stuff!"
5,I LOVE IT!,"While the one reviewer is correct that 3 songs are ""recycled"" from the earlier EP, they are also re-recorded, re-written in some cases and sound absolutely awesome. I love the guest vocals but have seen FireFlight perform the new songs and they do an amazing job. Must have album and look for a concert date coming in your neck of the woods!"
5,downright good,"Many times I feel sorry for bands that get the ""christian rock"" label, for fear that their music gets left behind with todays mainstream rock. They should have more of a chance to compete with the other mainstream bands. I am beginning to find more and more ""Christian rock"" bands with better musical skills than the overplayed radio tracks we hear everyday. I give props to those bands who stay true to themselves without getting caught in the marketing aspect of music. I don't care who believes in what,...what I do care about is finding good rock bands with fresh sounds and melodies. This CD could easily have many radio worthy hard rock tracks. A solid pick for any rock fan!"
4,Good christian rock,"If you like good solid rock and a touch of melody mixed with a God centered message, this is a great cd. I have a hard time getting into christian rock, it just doesnt move me musicaly. Fireflight have a great sound and the cd is well produced."
3,First CD of a great band,I bought this because it was the first CD from one of my favorite bands. The groups style had not quite matured yet on this first CD.
2,Not thrilled,"The item was purchased for my daughter, no sparkle and it would bend pretty easily. My husband talked me into keeping it because we were short on time for Christmas presents. My daughter liked it but if given more time, I would have returned it and gotten something better."
3,Chives Cuisine Art Poster Print,"Not worth paying the same in shipping for this product. It's cute and it works in my kitchen, but I should have gone to Wal-Mart."
1,Flawed,"Just an example of how the author doesn't know what (s)he's talking about:""Probably the best-known technologies used by processors are Intel's Hyper-Threading and AMD's HyperTransport. Both allow each logical processor within the processor package to handle an individual thread in parallel with other threads being handled by other processors within the package.""This is an elementary error, that even amateur hardware enthusiasts know is wrong. Hyper-Threading and HyperTransport are two very different things. The former is what the author describes, the latter is a bus. It suggests that the author doesn't know much about hardware, and probably created the book by googling and using sources that may, or may not be correct."
2,Terrible Book Done For Money Only,This book was essentially a book about the parts of a computer. I strongly suggest that no one buy this book. Check out the internet to answer the questions you may have about the contents of a computer. A professor of mine picked this book as the class text and it was a complete waste of money and paper. The student CD was missing a lot of referenced images and materials. The online student companion files were inaccessible. The text relied heavily on images from Intel's website. There was nothing original about this text or the contents it had in it. DO NOT USE THIS CLASS FOR A TEXT UNLESS YOU HAVE TO!
4,Fun and educational!!,"Our kids love this DVD set. They watch their DVD players when they go to bed, but they can only watch educational DVDs. This is the perfect option. They both (4 and 7 years) love them."
4,TEENAGERS KICK MY BUTT EVERY TIME,I am such a big Ani fan that sometimes it is so good to listen to girl-folk-rock that you can understand instead of all that gibberish and mumbled glossilalia. Dar has this certain thang about her. And she is so lovely yeah yeah yeah. Girl-music and it's various genres are often stereotyped but I love DAR all the same.DAR!
2,disappointing,"William's first two albums made me such a fan I began to rank her as one of my favorite artists. Then I got this one. Not only is this album not as good as the others, it is embarrasing to listen to. I have no problem, as many do, with the highly-produced, more polished sound--it's the lyrics that bother me. ""As Cool as I Am,"" an earlier piece, is one of the best songs ever, and when I listen to this album it's hard to believe it's the same songwriter's work."
4,my thoughts,"I don't know what kind of music reviewer I am, but I can say taht this CD has seen me through some difficult times. These sounds, and If I Wrote You...whew...I get a lump just thinking about the messages in those songs. I find Dar so insightful, sometimes I think she is singing my life.I find her music uncompromising, meaningful with no apologies for twisty lyrics and unusual topics. I have to say after hearing Teenagers, Kick our Butts...not my favorite, but Dar is Dar. Thank goodness for skip tracks instead of fast forward!I gave my End of Summer disc away because I wanted to pass the good stuff along, but I am finding I am having Dar withdrawls...so, back to the purchasing page I go!"
4,Best Compilation Available...still missing some key songs,"This is the most comprehensive compilation by this band currently available in one set, but even though there are extra tracks featured here that aren't part of the For The Record set, there are some blatant omissions that should be mentioned: no Love In The First Degree, Closer You Get, 40 Hour Week, Then Again, or Once Upon A Lifetime. These are all on the For The Record set. Any fan will probably find tracks that seem to be missing from both sets such as Angels Among Us, God Must've Spent, Maker Said Take Her, TLC ASAP, Take A Little Trip, and Cheap Seats. These are also pretty well known tracks that you'll have to buy other records to obtain. Hence, there still isn't one complete set that covers all the bases. There needs to be a box set that has all the singles plus some bonus stuff for collectors as well..."
4,Another great Traveler's Tales,"This book, like all of the Traveler's Tales books, is the product of thoughtful editing. Here are stories of real people in Italy. And each one seeks to show the beauty and complexity of the place. These are not just the stock images here. These are beautiful, sometimes intense stories about a place that, for so many, is out of reach. This book is a journey. Good, Bad, Ugly and perfect, flaws and all. Read it, enjoy and then, go."
1,"Silly, offensive, and patronizing","In the introduction we are regaled to a reminder of the stereotype of the Italian gangster or buffoon. There is a story about a casual sexual encounter that seems entirely out of place in this day of AIDS. Italian men are portrayed as habitually unfaithful to their wives (""The Italian Mistress""). There are excerpts that characterize the ""average Italian citizen"" as an inveterate cheater. Italians, we are told, are breast-obsessed. This book is a paradigm of the sort of travel writing that romanticizes the exotic ""other."" I see no reason to think that this brings anyone closer to the ""real"" Italy and it is silly and simplistic to think otherwise. It would appear that in these days of political correctness it is still considered acceptable to portray Italians in a patronizing way, in contrast with almost every other group or ethnicity. This book is insulting both to Italians and to the reader's intelligence."
5,Camp Weasel!,"My ferrets love this wonderful tent. It is so exciting to buy them new toys just to watch their reaction. They love this little tent. I have one ferret that loves to take things and hide them. She has turned this tent into her own little place to store: jewelry, toys,dog toys, clothing, hair scrunches, and other things she can find. It is fun to clean this little tent once a week to look for the items I am missing!!"
3,Mixed Review,"Very mixed review on this shoe. To start with, I'd be embarrassed to admit how many shoes I have purchased from Amazon, mainly heels but also hiking boots, trail runners and flat. I have NEVER had a problem with quality or have questioned if the item was ""used"". But, I bought these shoes for myself, and 5 other bridesmaids, to wear for a wedding in a month and obviously wanted them to be perfect. I honestly would have exchanged the pair if I had more time and knew I'd get them back before the date. There is a slight stain on the front of one and marks on the back of the bow on the other in a light red. Since I've never had a problem before I will let it go. But, it makes me hesitant on wanting to purchase a pair in another color. I love the look. I love the colors. They are comfortable. The bow in the back gives it a different feel. But, I would not want to be disappointed with the quality or wear again. Will update my review after I wear them all evening at the wedding."
5,Very hot shoes!,Very feminine and flirty pair of shoes. Everyone noticed them when I wore them for my birthday. I even got comments from people I didn't know. They are so fun and unique. I love them!
3,Very sexy shoe- slightly uncomfortable after a few hours,"Very sexy shoe. I bought this shoe for a wedding that I was in. The shoe matched perfectly. I was concerned that the shoe was a bit too risque for the wedding, but it actually turned out to be a perfect complement. The shoe arrived very quickly and the price was just right. The shoe was easy to walk-in at first, but I must admit that after about 4 hours my foot was a bit uncomfortable, but the first time that I ever put the shoe on was that day and I spent some time walking around and dancing, so it's to be expected to some degree- That's the reason for the 3 stars."
4,Beautiful shoes,"This was my first time ordering shoes online. I bought the shoes for my cousin's wedding. The delivery time was great and the shoe was fabulously beautiful. I wear a size 5, and they looked great on my feet, , but these were tighter then I thought, I would've ordered a size bigger but since it was a last minute decision, I didn't have time to wait for the next pair. Even though I had to return the shoe, it was beautiful."
1,Poseur alert,"This woman is an overaged hippie loser. Apparently she got my e-mail address from Facebook; now she feels she has the right to stalk me to buy her ""video"".More Facebook trash; don't let her get your coordinates."
3,"Cheeky, and good for the soul.","Gotta love the dollar bin at the record store. This is some good soul from 1976. It's probably just what you'd expect. There's a dose of funk in there too with some nice horns. Not heavy on vocals but what's there is good singing. If you find it on LP like I did, the cover folds out to give a nice shot of Miss March 1972. What's not to like?"
2,"Very Poor Video, great 5MP stills","The SCD6550 is a great idea, but just doesn't preform as I had hoped. I was looking for one camera to take on vacation, replacing carrying a 2 year old Sony MiniDV and a 5 MP Sony CyberShot. My Sony takes 1 MP stills, has excellent video, but @ 1MP, the stills are not nearly print worthy. This camera is actually smaller and lighter than my Sony.The 5MP still camera function gave excellent results, both with flash and with natural light and outside. Shot for shot it produced either as good or better prints (4x6) than the Sony CyberShot.Digital video is this unit's short coming. I did identical shots inside and outside with the Sony and Samsung. The Samsung's video quality was very poor, looked more like analog or standard 8mm quality. Inside, with natural room lighting, it was pretty much unacceptable. Outside, the shots lacked the crispiness of the Sony. I took it back, will keep the Sony's and hope that Sony comes out with a greater than 2 or 3 MP model soon."
3,Video quality is very bad,I like the price and the concept of two lenses. The video quality is horrible indoor. Also the auto focus is so slow that I have to use the manual focus mode to avoid the problem. I recommend Sony.
2,Poor auto focus,"I thought I was upgrading from analog to digital but after seeing the videos I shot indoors I liked the analog better. Very poor and grainy. Also the focus is terrible! While filming 3 people in a row moving from one to the other the focus would blur then refocus. I filmed my daughter's ballet recital and could not believe how the auto focus kept bluring then focusing. Very disappointed with this purchase. I guess it's true what they say. ""You get what you pay for"" It seems under $600.00 doesn't get you much."
2,Poor indoor/low light quality,I would agree with the other review. The indoor/low light quality of the video is unacceptable. I will be returning the camcorder today to purchase another.
4,Acoustic Heaven,"On this C.D., Luka Bloom plays an acoustic version of a rap song, ""I Need Love"", that moved me to tears. If that is not enough, Graham Parker plays a song from the ""King of Pop...Bob Marley"" that is fabulous! Dion, Ric Ocasek, and Lucinda Williams play incredible acoustic songs. Barrett Strong, Janis Ian, and Fred Koller play acoustic versions of songs they wrote that will move you. It is a shame that there are only two volumes of this incredible series! If I did not already own this C.D., I would be happy to pay a premium to get a copy!"
2,Yuck. Bad batch possibly?,"I'm really hoping I got a bad batch, because this product is GREAT nutrition wise. However...* Product didn't mix well. I always had little clumps of protein stuck in my liquid no matter what I mixed it with. Tried water, almond milk, skim milk, orange juice, ect. I ALWAYS had little clumps of protein in my drinks, whether I used a blender shaker, stirred with a spoon, or just my normal blender. Bummer.* My batch wasn't unflavoured. Anything I mixed it with, took on the flavour of rotten milk. I followed the instructions to a T too, ""One scoop per 8 oz of cold liquid"" ectect. Even if I put 1/3 of a scoop in 12 oz. of skim milk, it still took on the disgusting rotten milk flavour!I feel like I wasted my money. ): This product really is inedible, or mine is at least. My gag reflex triggers the second I try to down it, and I've had a wide range of protein powders before. Never again will I try this brand."
2,Doesn't do well in heat.,"I bought this to use in baking in lieu of flour. However it tends to clump up when heated, giving food a grainy, rubbery texture. It's delicious in cold oatmeal though. I"
3,Mostly does what it's supposed to,"I bought this as a whey protein for use in smoothies and some recipes. It doesn't mix as well as some other brands. Being unflavored it does have a bit of a different smell and taste. It's rather subtle when mixed with fruit, but I wouldn't recommend it on its own."
3,Mixed feelings,"Ok, so I have very mixed feelings about this product. I decided to take off two stars.. one for each reason I would NOT recommend this product.First of all the taste: It is NOT tasteless. In fact, it tastes alot like coffemate gone bad. You can minimize the bad taste if you mix it with milk, but with anything else, you WILL taste it. And it does clump up a little bit.. I never got it to dissolve completely.The second reason was that this product made me really contipated from the fist time I tried it. And it just kept getting worse and worse until I had no choice but to stop taking it completely. This could just be me... Perhaps it was just MY body that had an adverse reaction to it, but I thot I should warn people that it did happen to me.On the positive side, this product did a great job of curbing my appetite. I had it in the morning for breakfast and at lunch time, I still wasnt really hungry. So in that sense, it really was great."
5,"No fancy packaging, no frills, all substance","At nearly $6.70 per pound, this may be - pound-for-pound and pun intended - one of the best offering on the internet. Each serving (which is actually 28 g) gives you approximately 89.3% of pure, unadulterated whey protein isolate. There's a mistake in the production description: there's only 1 gram of carbohydrate per serving (28 g) so at 50 grams, it's roughly 2 grams of carbohydrate, not 7 grams.Here's a tip: put two scoops of unflavored NOW protein in a shaker, throw in some Crystal Light, add water, stir, and viola, you've got yourself an inexpensive homemade version of ISOP*RE."
2,Tastes like bleach,I bought this the first time and it blended well but had trouble dissolving. My typical method is to mix with skim milk and a few spoonfuls of nesquik. Unless you have a blender bottle and patience don't even think about this dissolving with just a spoon.I was able to get past the dissolvability with the blender bottle since it tasted fine and was generally flavorless with the nesquik but the second time around I am having trouble getting it down because the best way I can describe the taste is like bleach or maybe plastic-like. Not overpowering but certainly noticable and unenjoyable. The first order I was able to drink it like chocolate milk but this time around is another story.I am considering a return if the next few shakes taste the same because no way I am getting through 10 pounds of this. I will followup with my customer service experience.
3,Pretty good,I like how its only 105 calories but unflavored protein gets really boring after a while. Plus this doesn't mix too well :'3 it's okay. it's not my favorite but I do like it.
2,Its great stuff...if you can bring yourself to drink it,"I bought it because it was unflavored and people were praising that, so I gave it a shot. Its definitely not the worst tasting thing I've ever had, but I could only bring myself to drink 2 servings. I mixed with juice, water, milk, banana smoothie, all to no avail. I had to give it away. The taste is NOT unnoticeable, you absolutely can taste it - and IMHO it is awful. The taste was the only bad part, I couldn't bring myself to drink anymore of it."
5,Great Protein Powder,"This protein powder is awesome. It is free of additives, great for low-temperature baking in grain-free products, and the taste is clean. I like being able to customize my drinks: If I want chocolate, I add real cocoa powder + stevia. If I want vanilla, pure vanilla extract. I love putting freshly ground cinnamon in smoothies as well. Bottom line, this makes a great base without fillers and chemicals!"
5,high quality protein which mixes well,"this product contains high quality ingredients. it is very soluble, mixes easily, and does not have a nasty taste even when mixed with milk only. no artificial ingredients is a major plus."
4,"Good quality whey, good price","This is great stuff, and very well priced. Flavor it yourself, or just take it without flavor. The equivalent products are almost as much for less than half the amount!"
4,Quality at the Right Price,"Mixes well, tastes fine, and the price is reasonable so I would recommend this to anyone who wants to turbo charge their workout."
5,Tremendous Value,"I have had every mainstream whey protein powder sold at Vitamin Shoppe. Muscle Milk, MetRx, Pure Protein; blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. All those products are worthless. They are over marketed, and they have a bunch of nonsense (although healthy) in them. If all you need are the amino acids from a quick digesting protein, look no further. It's roughly $8 a pound, and if you get the bag without a flavor you avoid unnecessary sweetener chemicals; you get a nice neutral protein to mix with anything you want.I put this product in my cereal and in water. In water, if just a few stirs, it mixes completely. If you make it with even more time in advance it dissolves completely.If you're identity is wrapped up in brands, keeping blending your $15/pound Muscle Milk, if your identity is wrapped up in your muscles, buy this and sell your damn blender."
2,Ew.,Not. At. All. Good. Clumps in milk and tastes sour -- smells horrible. The only good thing is that is seems to be working OK.
5,Great stuff,"I'd purchased a 5lb container of this earlier, then the big bag when that ran out. I scoop out what I need into the 5lb container. Stuff is great - taste is mild, not disagreeable at all. I usually mix it with yogurt and a tsp of honey, when I'm in a hurry it mixes fine with straight water or skim milk. As long as Now keeps making this stuff I'll buy it. I really appreciate that it doesn't have artificial sweeteners - I'm not a food purist, but the majority of evidence I've seen exposes potential short and long-term health issues with those."
3,Good if you can handle the taste,"I bought the product because overly sweet sissy powders turn me off. It's pure so you get what you want. IMHO, the taste is absolutely terrible, what do you expect? So I kind of defeated the purpose by adding vitamin c powder and oj to make it bearable. Every time I drink it, it's a battle and I gag.So my recommendation is only buy it if you can suck it up. For me, I'll drink thru the pain, but this is not for everyone. The whey easily coagulates and the taste of a nugget sized unflavored whey is just nasty!"
4,"What it needs to be, but room for improvement","Shipping and service were handled fine. Protein comes in a large ziplock-sealing bag, which I find less than ideal for closing. The protein doesn't dissolve as well as I'd like, but with a little extra manipulation things work out. Protein to serving ratio is good and the ""flavorless"" flavor is bearable, though perhaps a bit on the bitter side."
4,Quality protien,"Bought this simply because of its purity. I started with the smaller 1.2 lb container at first to make sure I didn't mind the taste. This does not taste very good alone in milk. It is not tasteless, however if you add it to a strong flavored drink (most fruit juices) it will take on the taste of the drink and only change the texture. I mix with milk. I put the milk in the microwave for about 30 seconds prior to adding the protein. Warming the milk helps it mix with the other ingredients. After the milk is warm, I add the protein with some oat flour, unsweetened dark chocolate powder, and a little honey. It's a well mixed, great tasting drink with a lot of protein, some good carbs, and fiber."
5,As Good as it Gets,"Good moderate taste, and good value. Making good progress on muscle building and use this daily. Repeat customer and very satisfied."
4,Great mixed into other things. Kinda bad otherwise,"Good protein supplement as part of a exercise and diet routine. Blends very easily with everything I've put it in. However don't try to drink this blended straight with water. It has the smell of bad milk and the taste of diluted bad milk....it's not pleasant at all. But blended in with other things (juice, almond milk, etc) it's unnoticeable."
3,BAD TASTE!!!,"First of all, what I am about to say has nothing to do with the quality of the product, the nutrition facts or anything; I bought this because of all the good reviews and the whim of trying out different products.I saw reviews complaining the taste, but at that time I was like ""How bad could it be?"". But right now I have to say, the flavor is really disgusting. I feel like throwing up by just smelling it. Every time I have to hold my breathe and try to finish it asap; I also dilute it by adding way more water than the actual need so that it tastes less disgusting.I would recommend Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Protein, Strawberry flavor. So far it has the best taste I've ever had and it offers enough protein one needs as well."
2,Worst tasting unflavored whey of three brands I tried,"Taste is subjective--however, having tried three brands of unflavored whey, this has a really odd, non-dairy overtone. A very artificial, chalky taste. It is also the least expensive, per gram of protein, of the three. I often just shake some whey with milk and Ovaltine or Hershey Chocolate, or a bit of ice-cream. Even with chocolate in it, the Now Brand has an odd flavor I don't like at all. Youck--won't be buying it again!Best is Jarrow--very natural, an almost cream taste. It is also the most expensive, per gram of protein, of the three.Next best is Ultimate Nutrition Prostar--not as cream tasting, but not bad. OK for the price, as it is less than Jarrow."
4,jus got it,i just got this protein in today it took longer than expected but so far im pleased.........i will write another review after 2 months of taking it.
5,Nothing else gets even close!,"It doesn't get any better. Look at the ingredients of other brands that claim to sell isolate. You'll be surprised that most of them are a mix between isolate and concentrate. Not this product, this is the pure stuff. No junk flavors or additives. I mix it with water and no sweetener added. It tastes like crap but be a man and admit that it only takes 2 seconds to consume it, so who cares. I much prefer the odd taste than to intake some mystery flavored crap. Super easy to mix too."
5,No frills protein powder!,"I bought this to add protein to my green smoothies. It is truly unflavored, it's just protein and nothing more. I haven't had any of the clumping issues that people have described. The trick is to just stir it, let it sit in the liquid for a minute and then give it another stir. Good stuff!"
5,WOW,This protein Isolate is wonderful. I had been looking for one that is unflavored. Currently I add a scoop of it to my breakfast cereal each morning. It mixes very well and doesn't change the flavor of the cereal I am eating. Highly recommend it. :)
2,Unappealing texture,"I purchased this item because I was looking for a low/no flavor protein powder to add to smoothies and the like. I was disappointed with the texture it added, even in small amounts, which was gummy and thickening/foamy. I've previously used soy protein where this wasn't an issue. I'm not sure if this is a property of just this product or whey proteins in general, but I wouldn't recommend for the use I described."
1,you no its good for you when it taste that bad,you no its good for you when it taste that bad it smells weird and i Through it away you no its good for you when it taste that bad it smells weird and i Through it away
5,"Best protein, natural, dissolves well, tasty, and economical","This has to be the best protein on the market. It's all natural (personally very important), dissolves well, tastes great, and is economical. Buying the 10 lb bag saves you money and it last quite a while."
2,Taste ? Hmmmm.,"I understand that a lot of purists (correctly) point out the fact here that this product tastes bland because it EXCLUDES bad stuff (dextrose, sucrose, or whatever) used to sweeten or improve taste. I get it. But I'm just relaying my experience here for those ""on the fence"". IMO, this really doesn't taste good. Even with heaping quantities of strawberries, pineapples. Call me a ""woose"", but I have been devising my own formulas (with ""bad stuff"") to give this better flavor. That's something I'd rather not spend time doing, but I want to use the 5 pounds and I want to enjoy the smoothies."
2,Awful taste,"I bought this product due to the appeal that it was basically as bare boned as you could get in terms of taking protein. No unnecessary ingredients, etc. I laugh when people tell me they hate the taste of casein. Let me tell you I love my casein in comparison to this stuff. Flavorless? My judgment told me not to believe and I was duped. I can drink anything as I usually just mix my protein with water and chug it. I've never complained about taste, until now. This stuff tastes TERRIBLE. Water is the worst. I've tried it with milk and gatorade (yes I even went to gatorade to mask the taste). Still tastes awful mixed with both. Now that I have to mix it with all sorts of other stuff to bear it, I have defeated the sole purpose of me buying it in the first place. I would not buy again and would advise you to stay away, or maybe try a flavored option. This stuff does mix very well, if there was one pro."
3,Price increase,"With the price increase, it is now less expensive to purchase an alternate product from Wal-Mart. You lost my business."
5,Great product,"I had a gastric sleeve procedure in May, 2011 and was in need of a good whey based protein product. I am very pleased with the flavor (none) and the ability to mix this product with foods and beverages."
5,Best protein powder,One scoop of this in the smoothie each morning....no fillers. Excellent product. does not affect the flavor at all.Purchased large to share with other family members.
5,Great,"The product is for my husband who requires lots of extra protein due to kidney disease. I mix it with water, as he prefers no flavorings. The doctor is pleased with his lab results."
5,great powder for all purposes,This powder is a little tough to mix in but that is its only down side. I ran out so a picked up a different brand at the store and it tastes way too sweet. with the NOW brand there is no flavor so you can use it in anything. i also have a hard time finding the Isolate Whey protein in the stores so that is another plus
5,Yummy,"This is exactly what I have expected. No sugar, no sweetener, no nothing. Just protein. It mixes easily and tastes good (to me)."
5,NOW is the Protein for Clean Natural Living,"NOW Foods Whey Protein Isolate, 100% Pure 5LbThis product appears to be better than other high dollar proteins, i.e., dissolves quicker and completely, has a pleasant taste without artificial flavorings, and easier to get at through the big mouth opening. Didn't have a scoop that I have found yet, but that is the little things that really do not matter. My landlady has borrowed some and is now ready to order her own; she is the one who insisted on stevia in lieu of Sucralose being healthier and most natural, that is how I found NOW Protein powder. I am pleased with this as compared to others so far, only time will tell of it's effectiveness and benefits. It is the least adulterated with preservatives, sweeteners, and artificial additives of any I have found, all natural ingredients.I like it."
5,Great natural whey - no artifical sweeteners or other fillers!,"Excellent product. We were tired of finding Acesulfame K and other artificial ingredients in other whey powders, so this fit the bill! The only downside is that is it's slightly more difficult to mix than some of the other whey powders out there. But I add it to a fruit smoothie - unfrozen and frozen, and it gives it a nice texture and flavor. Since I know it's natural, I'll cut it with a fork and knife if I have to!! LOL We were very pleased with this purchase, and you can't beat the price or the fact that it's pure isolate. Wonderful company!"
1,gross,"I thought I'd try some unflavored whey so it wouldn't dominate the flavor of my meal, but this is simply whey-flavored whey rather than chocolate-flavored or whatever. It tastes like some mixture of butter and eggwhites. The texture is lumpy and slimy and it doesn't mix very well.In water, the flavor is pretty mild but the texture and the thought of drinking a whole glass of it makes me nauseous. It completely overpowers milk. I couldn't imagine adding this to anything else without completely ruining it.I see no reason to buy this when there are cheaper brands with much better flavors, better textures, that mix easily."
2,Unflavored? - Tastes & smells like rotten milk.,"I'm really puzzled with the number of outstanding reviews on this product. The few negative reviews seem to nail what I've found with trying to use this unflavored protein powder.I've tried it with juice, water, & milk and once the liquid hits the stuff it smells and tastes like rotten soured milk. It's very strong and overpowers everything. The few bad reviews go back a number of years, so I wouldn't say this is an isolated issue, but rather the normal product."
2,I got it last month for $14.39/lb... now it's $17++/lb? Forget it.,"This is not the first time I purchased NOW 100% whey protein isolate 1lb. This is the first time I got it from Amazon. In a matter of a month, the price went up from $14+ to $17+. I previously got this from my healthy grocery store for $14/1lb on a non sale day and 10-11/lb on a sale day. I don't think I'll be getting it from here again."
5,No Artificial Sweeteners = No Bloating / Gas,"I was using Cytosport's Chocolate Whey Protein in the 6-pound bag from Costco. But its artificial sweeteners were difficult for me to digest and made me gassy (if you look at the small print on the bag, Cytosport uses acesulfame potassium and sucralose). Looking for an unsweetened alternative, I found NOW's whey isolate and decided to give the 5-pound container a try. For me, it is like night and day ... NOW gives me no gas and I don't get that bloated feel Cytosport's whey was giving me.From a taste viewpoint, I like NOW's unsweetened version better too. As others have pointed out, it takes on the taste of whatever you mix it with. I usually mix it with lowfat or skim milk, sometimes with a banana or berries thrown in (the Cytosport was way too sweet for me). I've even mixed it in with fresh squeezed orange juice for breakfast.If you have problems digesting artificial sweeteners or just want to avoid them, I highly recommend you give this a try."
5,My favorite protein powder,"I love this protein powder. It mixes easily using just a spoon or a shaker. It's almost tasteless, so you can gulp it down as it is, or if you prefer mix it with cocoa powder or whatever flavoring you want. I have a sensitive stomach and usually these protein drinks and mixes upset my stomach. I have gone through several containers of this stuff and I have not had a single issue with upset stomach, even when I take it first thing in the morning on an empty stomach. I highly recommend this to anyone who's looking to supplement with Whey protein."
5,Can't complain,"A pretty damn good protein. I'll keep it short and sweet:Pros:-Basically tasteless (tastes a little funky in just water), works excellently with milk, shakes, fruit drinks, etc.-Comes with a measuring scoop (holds 28g).-Mixes pretty well in a shaker bottle.Cons:-Can get clumpy, and definitely doesn't ""mix instantly."" Make sure all of the powder is wet or submerged before you mix it up, otherwise it will stick to the sides of the bottle and become very hard to get off.-Pretty expensive, and runs out faster than you'd expect."
5,Clean taste,"This powder has no particular flavor but tastes pure and clean.I appreciate the fact that it has no artificial sweeteners which raise blood sugar,thus making fat loss more difficult."
4,Excellent value for high quality whey isolate,"Most economical way to get whey isolate, which we use daily in smoothies. We want the high quality protein to maintain protein mass as we get older (now 70 YO) but we also want the gluatmine affect for immune system reasons. The only issue with this product is the flimsy cardboard box that the shipper sends it in. We have ordered it twice and both times it has arrived barely holding together. Just need more substantial cardboard for a 10 lb product."
4,Hard to blend,"I ordered Now Whey Isolate 10lbs. I like the unflavored ( natural )The price was pretty decent compared to other products out there I liked the product description. Mostly by what's not in it.What I haven't cared for is the way It won't blend with juice, water or Milk when you use a blender cup.I have found it leaves un-blended white chunks. So I always have to bring out the blenderIf they could fix that it would be perfect.revision...04/26/11 I love this product...it always taste great and now that I got a blender stick for xmas. The problem of unblended whey is no longer an issue. But if I ever travel without my stick the same problem would exist...so I've managed to conquer that as well I start out with a little warm water and a spoon or fork to get it started then add my whey and shake. That seems to allow the whey to liquefy better..."
5,Cleanest whey out there,"I have been bodybuilding for about 2-3 years now (been really serious the last year) and have tried a number of different whey protein shakes. This particular product by NOW foods is probably the best whey protein out there. It has an amazing amino acid profile, yielding 25 g of protein per scoop. It has minimal cholesterol and fat while still providing the necessary calories for energy. Granted, it tastes bland (since it's unflavored) but that doesn't matter when you're after the protein. As for mixing, the blender bottle by Blendtec or something with the shaker ball is all you need."
4,One of her darker albums,"A little less well-done than some of her others, but still lovely. And the ""Coed"" song is hysterical. The title track is actually probably the weakest of the bunch. But still, it's a great album - it's just that she has so many great tracks and albums that my standards for Dar are perhaps too high! If you don't already own most of her other albums, I'd recommend either the new ""Beauty of the Rain"" or ""End of Summer"" first. But if you have some of her other stuff, and especially if you like her more beautiful, haunting ballads, go for ""Mortal City""."
1,If I can stop one person from ordering this...,"My time will be worthwhile.I bought this cd because it came up in my Amazon.com recommendations. I am a fan of Ani DiFranco, and I think that these two artists must exist in a ""recommend each other"" loop for Amazon.com. I listened to the clips available online, and thought her voice was quite enjoyable.I'm sorry, though...I suppose these lyrics are supposed to be whimsical, or eclectic or lightly-biting commentary. I call them insipid. Irritating. Downright obnoxious at times. I mean, c'mon...'Now when the Christians sit with the pagans, the only thing burning is pumpkin pie??' (Don't write to me and tell me I got the lyrics wrong, I couldn't bear to listen to it again to get them just right.)Honestly, I am not usually this cranky about music. But, this one really got to me. Obviously. So, if you are hesitating...I suggest you borrow a friend's copy before you invest in the cd and shipping."
5,Dar's best CD and just a great folk CD,"All Dar Williams fans know when they first discovered her music. For me, it was a compilation tape a friend made for me with the song ""Iowa."" Based on that one song, I bought the CD.I own all of Dar's CDs (and have been to three concerts). Mortal City contains some of her best songs. Her slow songs and upbeat songs flow efforlessly into one another. They are all wonderful. Her lyrics and melodies are uniquely her own; you never get the impression that she is trying to copy another singer or be something she is not.With clever lyrics and beautiful melodies, this CD is folk music for the next generation (those born after they heydays of Joan Baez, and Peter, Paul and Mary). But, this is a great CD for all lovers of folk music and for those who think folk music is cheesy and boring."
4,yes!,"Wow. A friend played me this CD a few years ago, and I liked it, but pretty much forgot it until about a year ago I suddenly couldn't get ""The Christians and the Pagans"" out of my head, and had to figure out who sang it. I enjoy and respect what she has to say on so many issues, and still it's easy for my friends and me to see different things in her songs, especially ""Cool As I Am."" I've never regretted buying this; it speaks to so many different parts of my personality, and is some of the best new folk I've heard, besides. Since getting this I've become more and more an avid Dar fan the more I listened to her music!"
4,Christians and Pagans,Wonderful album. Variety of sounds for all the songs. Many catchy songs with wonderful lyrics. Great Album!
2,"nice pretend toy, but not great sound",The microphone is not amplifying my daughter's voice and the recorded music is not great. She still likes to play with it as a pretend microphone and shouts into it. Do not buy it if you want a real microphone.
2,Musical Theater Rock,"Yes this stuff is catchy and cute, but most of these songs sound like commercial-like jingles to me. I can hear the Beatles influence, but listen to nickel creek's ""spit on a stranger"" or any weezer song and you'll hear a much more interesting beatles influence. This is like musical theater rock. In other words Pepper's Ghost seems like a bunch of musical theater guys who picked up guitars and put on some ripped jeans. I saw these guys play live at grape street philadelphia, and they were very bubbly and full of energy which was nice to see, but they were clearly very full of themselves. It seemed they were more interested in how they looked in their cool rocker clothes than the actual performance. However I do wish these guys the best (and they will clearly be successful because they are playing to the 14 year old girls), but they are hardly artists. They have really amazing voices, they should just leave the songwriting up to Sondheim and Jason Robert Brown"
3,Hmmm,"More like 2.5 stars so far. Only song that Really stood out for me was ""All I Know"". The others are kinda forgettable. Maybe I need to spin it a few times."
2,it is not that usefull.,"each time when I open my digital camera, this memory was read from the begginning. it wastes my time and battery."
3,Can Card be used with DS-2200 Digital Voice Recorder???,"I am most likely going to purchase an Olympus DS-2200 Digital Voice Recorder, for doing audio History of many Seniors I know, and most likely, many I don't know yet.It would be very helpful for me to know if this is compatible with the DS-2200.The one review I did read, said that it took approximately 2-3 times longer to load into memory, in his Olympus Camera, so because I am still ignorant on this, I will possibly not buy this larger capacity card, before my fairly urgent purchase. (A 96 yr. old, extremely close friend, is likely, dying as I write this.I will make one attempt to contact Olympus 1st.If anyone knows the answer, please post it.Thanks,Tall Paul"
4,"Good product, good price!","This card gives me a ridiculous amount of storage...6000 plus photos at low-quality and 400 at super high quality on my olympus C-50 camera. The camera needed an upgrade to use it, which was free and only cost me one way shipping. I only give it 4 stars (as opposed to 5) as the card seems a little slower than the one I had previously - however, the original card was much smaller and it also may be a function of the camera. In all, I am very happy with this product."
5,Fast Enuf 4 Me,"There were issues expressed over the ""slowness"" of this 1 gigabyte Olympus brand XD card. I tested it, and it's NOT slow! For testing, I used an Olympus C8080 digital camera in Super-High-Quality mode, full-color, full-screen.The write time is consistently 3 seconds. I know this is a subjective issue, but for me, it's fast enough.For an 8 megapixel camera (my C8080) in super-high-quality mode, this card will store 261 photographs.This is interesting: the 1 gigabyte CF card in my C8080 has less capacity; only 254 shots. I give this card 5 stars, because the performance matches the price."
2,Slow!,"Although it's great that this card allows you to store so much information, it stores photos MUCH slower than the 16MB xD card that came with my camera. The camera is also made by Olympus (Camedia C-765UZ) so presumably there's no compatibility issue. I'd estimate that it takes two or three times as long to save to the 1GB card as to the 16MB, using identical camera settings."
4,Rarely have to change a *roll*,"Nice technology and the size, or lack of size, is quite amazing. I like to take a camera everywhere I go, I shoot manually, and prefer not to lug a heavy, brick-sized camera... or a lot of fiddly bits and pieces. I use a C-8080 on land or, while sea kayaking, a C-5000 in a dive-housing, both take the 1GB card. I used to walk around with spare cards, just like spare rolls of film in the old days. Now, unless I'm on an extended backcountry trip, even shooting RAW or TIFF, the 1GB card usually has enough storage to hold me over until I can download to my computer. The read/write and download time may be a little slow for some, but my *instant gratification* meter isn't as caffienated as some folks - that's why I give it 4 instead of 5 stars."
4,Good product but found from a article from Wikipedia that H type is better than M type xd Cards,The memory card so far did not given any problems..But an article from Wikipedia suggests that H type xD card is better than M type one...I have not tried H type xd card but i am OK with the present M type..... for casual shooting outdoor...
5,Olympus Type M xD-Picture Card,This card is not always readily availble with other picture cards. This was the fastest & easiest purchase. Exactly as advertised & very prompt service.
3,Shipping Pricey,"Product seems to be what it was suppossed to be. But, $10.95 for less than 2 oz. via regular US postal Service? That's ridulious! Also would not return call from number inserted in package to discuss shipping costs."
1,Did not recieve product to review,"There was a mix up with mailing address so did not recieve the product, so no review available."
2,"Slow or not, it destroys my VIDEO files","I got the Oly 512 MB and this Oly 1 GB card. They both work equally well with still images. Not so with movie files. If you make them too long, saving takes minutes and the chances are 75% that the movie will be corrupt after downloading, ready for the bin. That NEVER happens with the 512 MB card. No issues no matter how long the movie file is. Gotta keep that in mind when using the cards."
3,Slow to write wasn't the problem.,"Yes, it was a little slower to write the photos onto this one but the real problem is since it is set up for panoramic photos (only with the olympus photo software) apparently it seems to have a problem being read by card readers, even olympus's card reader, which you can get a software patch from them to fix this problem. Well, I tried the patch and it still didn't work and regardless of which card reader I used I got the ""card not formated"" message even after I formated it by both camera and two different computers. Not a real problem as I can still download the photos from camera to computer by USB cable. If I had it to do over again I would not buy the M type disk. Stick to the other flavor...H I think. It's supposed to be faster to write to."
1,sucks,this sucks!!!! when i bought them i thought they looked cool but when i tryed them they sucked!! dont buy these
5,Props,The product was recieved very timely. The puff cigarrettes were used in a high school play written and directed by students. They were very realistic and the smoke could be seen in the back of the audience. The play was a western and the product was better than expected.
1,looks real but does not work well,it looks real and it would work great for a play or a costume but does not act real. also the company will harass you if you say anything negative about you. if you want this for a play or costume then sure get it but if you want it as a prank then dont waste your money.
3,Fake cigaretts,I am using these for a college play they make good props. They fall apart sometimes so I ordered a few more for rehearsal.
1,bad idea,"I don't think this product send the ""right"" message to kids....gag or no gagIt wasn't until the late 70's that we put a stop to doctors and celebrities supporting smoking.We have not come along way baby with this product."
1,Ummm...,"Looking at the picture, you see the cigarettes in a nice little package.What I received looked nothing like how it looks there, they were lose in the packaging it was shipped in. It's like someone took them out of a bigger container and just sent them. I wanted to give them as a gag gift but I don't know if they're sanitary, I don't know who handled them. If I had known they weren't packaged, I wouldn't have ordered it."
4,Pretty good,"Overall this product was good, Did what it said and was great. Unfortunately, it took forever to arrive, there was only two and they weren't packaged the best, But overall this product was pretty good."
4,Pretty realistic,"Ok, so I guess I expected a little more but 4 stars is about right. The cigarette looks realistic but the fake smoke is more like powder coming out of it. When they say blow don't suck, you can suck but if you suck more than a little some of the powder can get on your tongue and you can wipe it off with something. The powder is not toxic but I wouldn't recommend inhaling it deeply like real smoke (not that its a good idea either but the powder is more solid and will probably stick too). Overall, I defintely think you could trick most people and its safe.P.S. if the ""smoke"" is not coming out anymore, you need to clean the end because its has holes for the smoke to come out and they are blocked."
1,Real Cigarettes are More Sanitary,No packaging whatsoever. No paper label as shown in the picture and no plastic bag to hold the cigarettes. I received two fake cigarettes thrown into a mailing envelope. How many people touched them before they were sent? I'm supposed to put them in my mouth? I don't think so. At least real cigarettes are properly wrapped.
1,would rate 0,This product was shipped in an envelope!!! Needless to say i couldn't use it for my play! Instead i had to make my own and roll a paper cigarette and color it! The packet was full of powder everywhere and the cigarette was flat. It would have cost more to return idiots next time put it in a box!
1,Not worth it at all!,Doesn't work at all and the powder goes into your mouth and it is so nasty. DON'T BUY THIS!!! I thought it was going to be better but unfortunately it wasn't.
4,Puff Cigarettes,"A lot of the ""ash"" was rubbed off but besides that these were pretty decent! They got the job done. :)They work GREAT in the cigarette holder I'll be using for my costume and they're easy to get the powder out of to look like you're smoking. They're realistic enough, it's pretty obvious close up but I'm sure at a distance they look muuuch more real."
2,They do not work,I bought this toy just for the heck of it and it does nothing it just is the way that you see it in the picture.
1,Innappropriate,This product is totally innappropriate and sends a very bad message to our your people who we are suppose to protect! Smoking is very bad for ones health and it STINKS! I am shocked to see this product advertised for children.
1,Fake cigarettes and cigars as a toy? Really?,"Fake cigarettes and cigars should not be offered as a toy for 5-7 year olds.I'm very disappointed in Amazon. Although this clearly comes from a third party vendor, amazon should screen any offers and remove any inappropriate ones."
2,not properly packed,"would be fun silly gift, but unfortunately they were not properly packed so they were crushed to the point that I did not even give them as part of the present."
4,Great prop,Great cigarette prop for variety of costumes. don't inhale tho! This is meant to be puffed out like powdery dust to look like smoke. very clever.
4,Music and justice,"Listen Tarancon is to take part in the history of thousands of humans who fights for liberty an life in south America. When you try to understand the origins of songs metafores you develop The sens of justice and reality. According the best of the sounds of the ANDES and intelectual base, you have Tarancon group who gave strengh and hope to many inocents prisoniers of the evil Military Regime in south America. Tarancon Inspired singers as Joan Baez, Mercedes Sosa And many others artists who fought for justice in the 60's and 70's."
3,Only fair...,"These are very pretty, but quite flimsy...the band began to tear away from the lace part after about three wearings."
2,The size was decieving.,The size was more like a 3XL she never used then and cant sent them back if you buy then get one size smaller than you need!
3,Weird Sci fi invades the moon Triton.,Really far out story of the colonists on the moon Triton.For the lovers of Delany sci fi.
2,Not as good as Traveler's Tales: A Woman's World,"I was quite disappointed with this book, after only reading a small handful of the essays. I found what essays I read to be overly introverted and psychological in tone. None seemed to deal with actual travel activities -- what the women saw, how they experienced a different culture, etc.Not that the writing itself is particularly bad; rather, I got the sense that the foreign country was mere background for the writer's angst. A closer look at the subtitle of the book corroborates my assertion: ""writing by American women abroad"". So, sit in France and write about your loneliness or personal obsessions -- and then it can be included in a so-called travelogue like this one.If you're hankering for the road, you'd be better off reading Marybeth Bond's ""Traveler's Tales: A Woman's World"". Or even Thalia Zepatos' ""A Journey of One's Own"", which includes her own travel essays."
4,Awesome drawing grogram,"This program is easy to use for anyone who has used at least one drawing program in the past. The manual gives you alot of great tips and explains ALL the features. You can export into all general formats which makes your art very portable. If they had included tutorials for each of the tools, I would have given it 5 stars."
1,Worst quality recording,"No doubting Gigli's talent. This CD is a great injustice to the memory of a great tenor. The ""quality"" of the recording is an absolute disgrace. This CD should be sold with a warning with respect to the poor sound quality."
2,Couldn't get through it.,"Sometimes neurotic, Jewish humor is funny (Larry David comes to mind), and sometimes it's not. ""Clinton & Me"" is an unfortunate case of the latter. I read all the positive reviews on here and was excited for the book to arrive, only to be disappointed with the product. I tried reading this book on four separate occasions, skipping and skimming around, and never got more than 30 pages at a time. Katz is largely boring with a bad habit of dropping names of the ""famous"" politicos he's come into contact with. He spends way, waay, waaay too much time discussing his very normal, un-noteworthy childhood (and by ""too much time,"" I mean any time at all). Note to self: having an interesting job does not make one an interesting person."
1,He didn't do what he said he did,"Someone once told me to believe 90% of what I saw and 50% of what I read. Well, this definitely falls into the category of ""I don't believe what I read."" When it comes down to it, the book is about promoting Mark Katz -- and nothing else -- which is precisely what Katz has been doing for years and years. He takes credit for others work -- and claims that he played a more central role than he did in the writing of Clinton humor speeches."
1,From the guy who made Dukakis funny?,"If you're a big fan of the comedy stylings of Michael Dukakis and Al Gore, this is the book for you. A less than funny journey through the author's career as a ""humor"" writer for some of the least funny people in politics. Maybe Al Gore really is funny, we'll never know. It's the jokes, stupid."
5,Mark Katz is truly hilarious--A Must Read!,"I stumbled upon this book in a local shop...and I can't tell you how glad I am that I found it. Katz tackles politics and Clinton with a wit, intelligence, and irreverence that makes this book an absolutely delightful read. From his childhood to a job as Clinton's joke writer, we are treated to the story of a class clown who somehow manages to becomes the humorist in chief for The White House. The jokes are funny, the narrative is charming, and the look inside the machinations of The White House is remarkable. Political junkies and humor fans be forewarned: you will not be able to put this book down!"
5,Simpsonism,The concept of Simpsonism gets rolling from season 4. The episodes have a KO punch and its a compulsory entry in any Collectors Library. MUST BUY !!!
5,i love this gun,ilove it the best episode is (camp krusty) its abouts a camp of bullies and krusty help them and have alot of fun
5,The Simpsons of 1992-3,"The Simpsons has quite simply become one of those iconic television shows like The Waltons, Cosby Shows, Happy Days, and Cheers of the world. It is true that some episodes and seasons are better than others over a twenty year run, but season four that aired in 1992-3 is one of the better seasons with such classic episodes like Homer the Heretic-where Homer meets a five fingered God, Brother from the Same Planet-Homer and Bart abuse Big Brothers & Big Sisters, and Mr. Plow where Homer starts a plowing operation only to be bested by Barney. You get all twenty three episodes with optional episode commentary, select episode Animation showcases, a making of the Simpsons feature, promotional commercials, Bush vs. Simpson and The Cajun Controversy--two features about contreversies the Simpsons started in this time period. Highly recommended if one can find an inexpensive set."
2,not near as good as the newer ones,"now don't get me wrong, the simpsons is the greatest show on tv. thats why it has been on for 14 and a half years and counting. but the real hummor and hallarious characters we see today didn't start until at least 1994 ( the 6th season ).It comes on weekdays at 5:30 cst. and new episodes come on on sundays at 7:00 cst.Wait just a little bit longer for that to come out and don't waste your money on this."
1,Wake Up,"I cannot believe that nobody is telling the truth about this very silly show. Yes it has some reputable points, but all these ideas are mismashed into a whole that rarely makes sense. Homer the Heretic and Triple Bypass are the only episodes with genuine emotion and laughter. Monorail is simply a hodgpodge of clever ideas stitched together by a very thin thread. I am sorry but the Simpsons is not as great as some people attribute it to be."
1,This Is What Is Considered Great TV,"I am sorry but after Season 3 the Simpsons just collapsed into a tepid joke machine more concerned with making snide comments about our society's problems and mining satire out of contrived and absurd situations. I am come on, at least put some effort into making the plot coherent and somewhat believable. Granted this is a cartoon and all, but still for being considered one of the greatest shows ever, it seems to lack any semblance of reason."
4,It's been my earliest memory of TV,"I have seen so to many episods of The Simpsons I've heard,but the most important thing I love about The Simpsons even more then the new seosons is the treehouse of horror 3. I'm only 10 but I have seen almost every simpsons episod."
5,Simpsons Season 4 is among the best,"Season 4 is a very good bargain to add to your dvd collection. Among the best episodes include KAMP KRUSTY and Entertainment Weeklys #1 rated episode about Homer fighting the Power Plant for a dental plan back. If you are a diehard Simpsons fan or a casual watcher you will be satisfied with this and even if you aren't, you could find one of your friends who does and not lose hardly any money."
4,Great addition to your Simpsons collection,"I can't say anything that hasn't already been said with respect to how good this show/season is. You know if you are a Simpsons fan by now.I did want to address one issue I have with the season 4 DVDs. There is always an annoying gap between the time you make a selection on the menu and the time the selection takes effect. During this time you are forced to watch an animation. Some animations are very long and can make navigating the extras very tedious. You can skip the animation by pressing the ""Next Chapter"" button on the remote.I do want to congradulate Fox for finally putting the Spanish language track on this set. It was absent from previous Simpsons sets."
4,Great Show,"On thursday june 3, I walked in to my local blockbuster looking for a moive to rent. To my suprise I see the simpsons season 4 on the rack. Quickly I grab it knowing that it will not be out for around another 3 weeks or so. I was exited to get home. I opeaned it up right away. The episods are great the only problem is the menuse are repeitisent. overall quality"
5,Waste of breath,"Rating a season of the Simpsons is a futile endeavor. The Simpsons is great, possibly the most entertaining 23 minutes and change on TV ever, bar none. The commentaries are great, the packaging is slick, and if you're on this page you more than likely intend to buy this season.So just do it already and stop wasting your time reading glowing reviews."
5,Awesomely Excellent!,"Woohoo! What can I say?Season 4 is definitely when the series was at it's best.It's my second favourite season, next to season 2.Where Season 2 was where the shows heart came from, Season 4 would definitely be it's soul. Or vice versa. I don't know.No other season has The Simpsons taking on broadway so much(Streetcar homage, Music man style in Monorail),Homer search for spirituality(wait, there's been other episodes on other seasons with a similar concept), love-stories-galore(Ralph in love with Lisa rocked, GO RALPH) and some other important stuff I won't mention due to time and stuff.Oh, yeah. Greatest Halloween episode ever and a five-fingered God that had theologians gasping.Go Simpsons!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,One of the best Simpsons seasons ever,"There isn't really much to say about this product other than that the fourth season of the Simpsons is one of the best seasons ever and well worth any television fan's time. Even though the animation can be a little crude (which only adds to the charm), the writing is of consistently high-quality. This season contains many famous episodes, but even the less well-known episodes are still very enjoyable to watch.The primary extra on this DVD set is the commentary that various people (writers, directors, Matt Groening) provide for each episode. While they sometimes end up discussing something far afield from the show, most of the time they provide entertaining, interesting, and insightful commentary on how the episodes were created.Even though the Simpsons still runs in syndication across basically the entire United States, if you want to have access to some of the best episodes of the Simpsons ever made, you need go no further than this DVD set."
4,What's with the censorship?,"Okay, maybe I have too much time on my hands, or pay too much attention to the Simpsons, but I'm still ticked off. One of the episodes has been censored. In ""Marge Gets A Job"", Bart uses several excuses to get out of taking a test while everyone tries to remind him of the boy who cried wolf. Finally, Ms. Krabapple tells bart that he's used ""Smallpox, the Bends, and that unfortunate bout of RABIES."" Bart says he's not over it, and calls her a stupid witch. However, when the show first aired, RABIES was originally Tourette's Syndrome! And it's still TS on the syndicated reruns! Is there some reason they changed it for the DVD? Did the PC Police show up? I still love the boxed set, but I feel I was misled. I want the entire series as it ORIGINALLY aired, warts and all. I'm sick of creators tinkering with their creations to make them ""better"". LEAVE THE SIMPSONS ALONE!!"
5,A Classic,"I never knew when I first watched the Simpsons back in 89' I would be so attached to them. I know South Park and Family Guy have come down the road and made people laugh too but the Simpsons have just demoinated the TV Viewing. I bought all the seasons so far and I can't wait until the fifth one comes out. The old ones are histerical and they are really just a pure classic. 14 years on air going on 15 this December. The new season is going to start soon and I'm not going to miss any second of it. Even though the show is supossed to be retiring in a few years, I'm still glad that this show is the longest running animated series!"
5,The best season out so far,"I've seen all four of the Simpson season box sets, and this is by far the best one to own. The show really hit it's full stride at this point, evolving into some of the wittiest social satire pointed at people that appreciate some depth to their televised entertainment. At this point The Simpsons was such a national phenomenon they pretty much had complete creative control from the Fox Network. This is also the season when Conan O'brien was producing episodes, and you had Phil Hartman (who I still miss to this very day) contributing so many zingers through his classic characters Lionel Hutz and Troy McLure. He even plays Barts big brother on 'Brother From The Same Planet'. All I can say is that all of the Simpson's Box sets are worth owning, but this one is the best out so far. One of my favorite moments was on Brother From The Same Planet when Homer was teasing the dolphin and then the dolphin steals his hot dog. Just absolutely brilliant stuff."
4,Pony express?,"The product was in great condition, however I think the seller sent it by pony express! It literally took almost a month b4 I got it....so much for it being on time for my husbands birthday!"
5,Very Very Good Season,"The simpsons is my favorite show and I really enjoy this season. My favorite episodes from this season were Mr. Plow, A streetcar named Marge, Duffless, Lisa's First Word, and Homer the Heretic. Other episodes include Last exit to Springfield, Kamp Krusty, New Kid On The Block, Marge Vs. The Monorail, I Love Lisa, and Whacking Day.If you have ever heard of the Simpsons than you should buy this."
3,Fragil casing,Good inexpensive lamp. Plastic lamp casing is fragil and would open easily in rough activities.
5,Quite possibly the best of the latest from the Middle East,"Harem is definitely *not* your stereotypical Middle Eastern percussion band. They openly experiment with blending Middle Eastern music and Western, and the results are nothing short of stupendous!The instruments and rhythms are familiar, but are used in new and creative ways. Add to this the fact that the musicians are all first-rate, and you have music with an energy that's been missing from Middle Eastern music.I like the fact the group has incorporated a couple of ""straight traditional"" pieces in the CD, and am constantly impressed by their musical ability. Fantastic!Those who attempt to dance to this music are going to find it requires being able to think ""outside the box"" - Way beyond the reach of the average belly dancer. Not because the instruments and the rhythms are unfamiliar, but because the music is so innovative, so *fresh*!"
5,Instant fun,"If you have a kid, odds are good you are used to making a beeline for face-painting stations at festivals and the like. Snazaroo paints have the lovely aspect of being water-soluble, meaning they wash off with minimal effort. While they are on, however, they present rich color without pulling on the skin or cracking off. A kit like this in the house guarantees a fun option when the kids are going stir-crazy (snow, rain, whatever) and need a distraction."
4,Great stories from a master of adventure,"I wholeheartedly agree with solkane@aol's review. Kane is an interesting hero in the typical REH mold. The varied settings of these stories drive home the ""stranger in a strange land"" aspects and REH's fast-paced style makes for enjoyable reading. I can devour a slew of REH stories like these in one sitting; H.P. Lovecraft's works tend to require more breaks. If you enjoy either author, this book is a fine addition to the genre"
5,Must-have for any lover of dark fantasy and horror fiction,"Solomon Kane's adventures are, in my opinion, among the best tales penned by R.E. Howard. None of his other heroes are as driven as Kane, nor as mysterious. The approach taken to the supernatural in these tales is also far more clever... and the supernatural seems far more horrific as a result.This book collects all of Howard's Kane writings, including even a poem that amounts to Kane's farewell appearance. It's a worthwhile addition to the library of any lover of fantasy and horror fiction... more modern writers in both genres owe more to Howard than most of them realize.On a final note, the 'fanboy' in me was particularly excited by the Kull cross-over in one of Kane's African adventures... when our hero stumbles into the final vestiges of the Alantean civilization!"
3,Thomas Wolfe Meets Bob Dylan,"Kate Braverman's ingenious writing shouts and sings a high skill at poesy and narrative. I think many of her readers are attracted primarily to her imagery and metaphors. There is a sameness at the center of her stories -- illness, death, putrefaction, decline. These brilliant stories follow the trend, and Braverman leans toward epic prose poems. Her characters are memorable in one way, similar in another. What I admore most about her is her intensely evocative setting in LA, proving once more that place can pass for story. If you love clean, spare writing with a strong narrative element and distinctive characters developing new and original themes, these stories are not for you. But if you want gorgeous poems set to prose, gobble it up."
5,wow,This book was amazing it is one of my all time favorites i have read it so many times and i never tire of it. i know you will love it too.
5,CMHOF,I hope some of you fellow fans of Dottie's will consider going to google and type in DOTTIE WEST PETITION and sign it once you get to it. They need 2000 signatures and as of today there were 1509. I signed it about 3 years ago and am number 300+ so you see it's a slow process. Have your friends sign it also. Way more than 1509 people had to have been Dottie West fans. Let's get her elected. She's way overdue. And it's a crying shame.
4,Nice little card,"A different kind of Christmas card. Inexpensive, unique, and it saved me from trying, at the very last minute, to find a set that wasn't grocery-store-Xmas-card caliber."
1,"Good wallet, bad mold !! :(","I am being generous giving it one star, I cannot give less.Functionally the wallet is exactly as described. Unfortunately, it also came with mold on it and smells awful. I hate to spend money on shipping it back, I want my money back."
1,Beware!,"The seams in this wallet ripped the first time I tried to remove a credit card...not just one of the seams, two of them at which time I stopped trying to get my cards out. This is going in the trash (once I rip all the seams to get all my cards out!). You get what you pay for in this instance."
4,Love it,"Its very useful, fits all my cards in. The quality of material is not great, but worth it for the price"
5,great wallet...,I purchased this 3 years ago in burgundy and it has been a great credit card case. leather has held up well and till date the credit card slots hold the 20 cards securely. even put m receipts in the inside pocket. love it...
4,Good deal,"The quality is great - soft beautiful leather, very slick design. The only problem is that the pockets are too tight and though the product is supposed to hold up to 20 credit cards after putting in 2 or 3 it becomes very hard to insert any more. I did it finally but now it is not easy to retrieve one card at a time when you need it."
3,Bifold Card Holder,"this is a good product .. but i would rate it only 3 coz the quality of leather is no great. but this is doable..its very tight wen u try to use it in the beginning.. but eventually it loosens up,wish the look n feel of leather was better.."
3,Credit card Holder,I love it but wish that the pockets were just a bit wider as they are a really tight fit for some of the cards.
1,I did like it UNTIL....,"It ripped within 4 months of my receiving this as a gift. My friend couldn't find the receipt so I didn't think I could return it. AND, it ripped where it wasn't even a lot of stuff in there. It ripped at the bottom left-hand side where it was ONLY holding my license."
2,Color not as pictured,"I am a quite disappointed in the color of the wallet. I ordered the tan color (so it would be easy to see in my purse). The wallet arrived quickly (within 2 days of my order) and I commend the seller in the speed. However, I found the wallet to be orange in color not tan as pictured. It is quite bright and not what I expected. It also had a little mold on the snap closure. The card slots were tight and hard to push in the credit cards. As another purchaser stated, I do not wish to spend the cash to send it back."
5,credit card wallet,"This is a great credit card wallet. I can see all my cards at once and I know immediately if one is missing. It's a tight fit for the cards at first, but I'm sure the fit will loosen over time. The leather is not what I'd call baby soft but for the price it's nice leather. I bought two and would buy them again as gifts for friends. I'm very happy so far with this wallet."
3,don't buy anything from amazon! they change their warrenties,"I purchased a Movado Men's Juro watch from Amazon. On the description it stated it had a manufacture warranty. Once I received the watch it was a Amazon warranty. I tried contacting Amazon for a month and was reassured the jewelry department would get back to me but they have not. This was an expensive watch and I was very disappointed, since it was a special gift for my husband."
5,Gritty and unique: Wonderful album,"Fred Eaglesmith's ""Lipstick, Lies, and Gasoline"" is a truly unique album exhibiting a wonderful blend of country, rock, folk, and, I would add, a touch of industrial music styles. His hooks on the songs 105, Pontiac, Spookin' the Horses, Time to Get a Gun, and Alcohol and Pills will echo in your cranium, but it his powerful lyrics that make the album. Mostly they're sorrowful and poignant as I've heard since Harris's ""Wrecking Ball."" In addition, there is in them the sense of writer getting to the core of life being lived. Like with Hand's ""The Truth Will Set You Free"" album, the smack of reality in his songs, which distinguish a perceptive lyricist, will make you sit up Catholic school straight just to relisten/re-enjoy to what you've just heard.This is all I can add to the good reviewers before me of Fred J. Eaglesmith (I'm glad he dropped the J). A triple threat musician with talent to spare. (Did you know he paints well too?)"
2,not as good as the samples!,Liked the samples of the songs- but was very disappointed when I got the whole CD as they dont stand up to the samples.
5,He is one of the great thinkers and motivators.,"Sure, from a guy named Bob you would expect a sales pitch. No, all I see in this book is great thinking and great formulation. Okay, where I got it, I did not get it from amazon. But I got it from The Psychic Eye Center in Thousand Oaks, CA-- which is seemingly unusual until you understand the message I got from Proctor and Proctor's book. No one can save you genuinely or take real action on your life but yourself. That is sometimes the ultimate sales pitch that does save lives and careers, genuinely."
3,Nothing life changing.,"It's kind of been there done that, heard it before. I absolutely think I should have money, I have no self esteem, poverty issues but so far the book is not wowing me. Maybe my ability to see what's not there is falling short. Maybe it's just not my time, or maybe it's just not meant to be....Whatever, I still hold to life is good. God is good, be happy and live in the moment."
2,Less Than Realistic,"We all would obviously like to be rich. I doubt Mr. Proctor's method is workable.A single example from the free version of this book recommends a person recover fromdebt by assigning 20% of income to the paying down of debt. IMHO, one would not be in debt if there was 20% extra to allocate to the paying down of the debt. The division of this amount to the creditors is to be accompanied by a note informing them one will be paying a certain amount which might be more or less what was agreed upon, though regularly. I would expect the reply from the creditors would be to pay them what was agreed or they will take legal action."
4,fast shipping and good price,I have not finished reading the book yet. I recieved the book in good condition. price is good.
4,"""Wonderful book!""","It's sad to find that this book is out of print. If you have read The Science of Getting Rich, by Wallace Dellois Wattles, you get the gist of this book. This is basically a rah-rah-rah motivational book with a lot of helpful anecdotes. It does point out the fact that one must act rather than just study and learn. A great book. Worth finding and reading."
4,An Uplifting Positive Piece,"You Were Born Rich is one more book among the many great works on positive and focused mindset making up the building blocks for a proper success oriented attitude. Bob Proctor is skilled in the art of articulating positive visualization as well as justification for riches.Proctor covers many areas of interest, most notably his explanation of the law of attraction and his positive viewpoints on the uses of money. One will also find as good an explanation as can be found of the Razor's edge principle, outlining the often very minor differences between astounding success and mediocrity.I recommend this book to anyone looking for an uplifting book to assist with a positive mindset or just searching for a motivation charge."
5,One of the best Books I have ever read!,"This is an amazing book and one of the best I have ever read. I could not put it down. I am truly at a lost for words. I have been pretty successful in my life, having created a million dollar company and living a very comfortable life. This book opened my eyes to what is possible. That I don't need to just settle; that God called us to live a life of abundance. As a result of this book I have the following daily habits:1. Waiting with Expectancy2. Let Go and Let God3. As as if I already received my dreams4. Not being moved by current circumstances5. Visualizing myself having great wealth6. Being disciplinedThis book blessed my life."
1,Disappointing,"This was supposed to be used a coffee table book, but there are barely any pictures to along with the lame descriptions. Some of the courses listed are super private...guess i will die unfulfilled."
2,Not Display or Coffee Table Worthy,"I bought this as a gift, and am very disappointed in how small it is. Yes, I could have -- and now realize I should have -- checked the dimensions, but I didn't.The photos are nice, but like others have said, there are not enough of them and the bottom line is that it is just not display or coffee table worthy."
