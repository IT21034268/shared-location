3,For die hard Beck fans only,"This album is fantastic if you are a true, deep down, die hard Beck fan. If you're not, don't buy it! This album is filled with a lot of noise and very experimental sounds. I am a Beck fan but this album turned me off, with the exceptions of ""Satan gave me a taco"" [which is absolutely hilarious, as well as one of the few musical bright spots on the album], & ""Puttin it down"" [a great song from beginning to end]. Songs like ""Ozzy"", & ""Rollins power sauce"" are great for their comedic value. Other than those listed, I'm not a big fan of most of the music on this disc."
4,"highly recommeded for fans of ""early"" Beck","My first impression was, uh oh, I just wasted $16 bucks. But after several listens, I was hooked. This album fluctuates between folk / country / artsy-fartsy noise and ""found art"" sound collages. Even less polished sounding than ""Mellow Gold"", this record is NOT for the casual Beck fan."
5,STEREOPATHETIC SOULMANURE ISN'T PATHETIC AT ALL!!,"Stereopathetic Soulmanure is yet another great Beck CD. Not only are the songs different from anything you've ever heard, they're also pretty funny. For anyone listening to this CD for the first time, check out ""Satan Gave Me a Taco,"" ""One Foot in the Grave (the song AND the CD of the same name)"" and ""Modesto"". You'll be hooked instantly!!!"
4,Plastic Donut Can of Spam...,"Outre, Strange, Bizarre, Incomparable. Anything goes on this cd. Steropathetic Soul Manure is easily one of the strangest records I've ever heard in my life, quite dismal and upsetting at times, light and comedic at others, this disc fuses together solid musicianship, soundbites, and idiosyncratic commentary with pungent flare. Although this is nothing like Beck's more highly regarded discs such as Odelay or Sea Change, it's still worth hearing if you're a fan of this very talented, creative man. Crystal Clear Beer, One Foot In the Grave and Satan Gave Me A Taco are my favorites."
5,if I could give it 6 stars I would,"Beck's best & most varied, & IMHO 1 of the best albums ever made. Me & a friend have done Puttin It Down for a tribute tape that may or may not end up being completed but it was fun doing it nevertheless. Fans of this should check out early Zappa stuff & Ciccone Youth's Whitey Album. A taco is the best food anyway."
3,If you reeeeellly like Beck,"Let me start by saying I'm giving it three stars because I'm more tolerant of jarring, grating noise than most and I love Beck. Caveat Emptor: I know plenty of people crazy about Beck who think this is complete non-sense. Saving everyone from a track by track breakdown, let me just say that the coherent moments are pretty good even catchy ""gem in the rough"" versions of what we've come to know of Beck. These moments are few and far between (or they can seem that way). If your new to Beck and looking for a place to start this is not the place go for Mellow Gold. For those who like their off-the-wall, stoner with a four-track weirdness to have a bit more coherence I would suggest maybe Ween's ""The Pod""."
1,StereoPATHETIC!!,Don't waste your money! Worst CD I have ever purchased. I have Mutations and love it but this... blows!
1,"If you liked ""Midnite Vultures,"" you'll hate this one","I was never much of a Beck fan until ""Midnite Vultures"" came out. I liked the pop sound and mindless lyrics. The reviews I read on the amazon.com site made me think that I would find a winner in ""Stereopathetic Soulmanure,"" too.Not so.I don't care if it is experimental, this CD has a bad drunken frat boy sound to it. Save your money for something better."
4,You'll be strange.,"This is collection of random stuff recorded by Beck between 1988 and 1993. It features folk music, country music, guitar freakouts, spoken word tracks and some indescribable weirdness. One of the odd things is some random guy named ""Ken"" singing a few lines from the Jimmie Rodgers' song ""Waiting For a Train"". ""Rowboat"" is a country song (written by Beck) that was famously covered by Johnny Cash. There are two unlisted bonus tracks on the CD. Track 24 features someone saying ""Stuck out here in the sand, they shot my mule and burned my wagon. Ran out of sourdough two days ago. Ain't got no more lard. God bless all you folks."" Track 25 features five minutes of silence followed by twelve minutes of noise. Serious Beck fans will enjoy this CD, but it may be too ""out there"" for some people."
5,Greg Stott from somewhere should go to hell.,"if your looking for something comercial in Beck's early work; don't try, especially if Midnight Vulture's was your first Beck purchase, you just shouldn't... just go back to watching your MTV / MuchMusic junk and forget you ever heard of Beck. (Greg Stott gave this album 1 star, and said it was boring 4 reviews ago; if this gets posted.)"
5,Weird...but a good weird.,"I bought this CD from amazon.com because it was the only Beck CD I didn't have (except for Golden Feelings and Western Harvest Field...whatever), and to tell you the truth it's kinda, I don't know...creepy. It, ah creeps the Hell outta me to tell you the truth. Just downright scary. But it's good. The intended...not really ""sloppy,"" but rather ""unpolished"" feel of the CD added to the appeal. I love the songs ""One Foot In The Grave"" and ""Satan Gave Me A Taco."" Sometimes, depending on my mood, I listen to it nonstop, other times, I'll pop in ""Midnite Vultures"" which is the best album of '99, hands down. It takes some getting used to, but buy it, give it a few listens and I guarantee it will grow on you."
4,"the one, the only...","Performs vocals as if in character. This album reminds me of early Ween. That lo-fi, throwaway, pranksterish quality. 90% of the tracks here are more like genre excersizes than fully-fleshed out songs. But for an artist of his caliber, even his castoffs are strangely compelling. Best songs are Satan gave me a taco, one foot in the grave, and rowboat, which was subsequently covered by none other than Johnny Cash."
2,Beck Blecch,This stuff is pretty annoying. It's a good thing Beck changes directions with every album.
3,"Probably his worst album, but even so...","...this still is worth a listen.... This album is NOT Beck's best album. It's his *worst* (discounting any pre-1994 stuff). However, it's not terrible by any means...standout tracks include ""The Spirit Moves Me"", ""Crystal Clear (Beer)"", and ""Puttin It Down"", among some others. Some of the instrumentals are interesting, too. Good for the hardcore Beck fans, but if you are just getting into him, buy everything else first so you will be ready for this."
3,Trendy ppl = shallow views,"OK, first from a musicians point of view whether the ""fans"" like the music is not a thought when making music. So all these ""top ten and etc. lists"" are ridculed by true artists.Ok now the album. While nonlinear and static-like it shows that you can express yourself through sounds. For all the people who dismissed this album, well if you act trendy and shallow, you will be ONLY that. Open your minds and throw preconcepts away. Whic is what this album is partially about."
3,Review of The Lunar Cycle,"Francesca Naish does quite a good job of explaining the method in a practical way. It is an interesting book written by a fertility practitioner, but it does not go into the subject in the same analytical depth (as say, Kevin Allen's book The Reluctant Hypothesis) and unfortunately it gives no details about how to calculate the all-important moon cycles for every month in a simple way (as Art Rosenblum's book did). Apart from that it's well worth a read."
5,A Must Watch Movie!!!,"Chris Pinto's ""A Lamp in the Dark"" is an excellent film that recounts little known and under-appreciated history of the Bible and Christianity from the 1st centurydown to our time. This documentary exposes the truth behind many of the conflicts between Catholicism and Protestantism, and why the two can never be reconciled. An eye-opener!"
5,Very well done and true!,"I will keep this short. If you really want to learn about the history of the bible I would buy this video. It is worth every penny. There is nothing more to be said than what all the other positive reviews stated. If you home school your children, this would be a great lesson for them to watch, take notes and study. Knowledge is key, and this is filled with the type of knowledge you want to fill your mind with - truth!"
5,Excellent history of how we got our English bible,"This is an excellent history of how we got our English bible. It is inspiring and a reminder that Christians were martyred/killed because they translated the bible into English (the language of the laity, not Latin, which back then was the clergy's language), so that, for the very first time, everyday Christians could read the precious Bible for themselves and find out for themselves what the bible said. Prior to that time, Christians were limited to priests (clergy) interpreting/explaining the bible for them, and were forbidden to read the Latin bible for themselves.This is the best documentary on the history of the English bible I have seen, and I have read many books on this topic, and very few DVDs have been made regarding this topic. This is the most thorough, historically accurate documentary I have seen thus far."
5,For all So-Call Christians,"An exceptional documentary rundown of how the various rendition of the Bible came about, and why. This is the most complete DVD about the history of the Bible that I have ever seen in many years. This DVD is simple to follow and easy to understand. They frequently throw in pictures and short dramatizations regarding the information being explained. The scripts are to the point and at times compelling. This DVD leaves nothing concealed. It's a must buy for any so-call Christian for there private library!If you don't gain knowledge from anything in this DVD, you are dim-witted!"
1,Untold should remain untold,"There's a reason this is ""untold"" history. It's really not the history of the Bible, but a continuous slam of the Roman Catholic Church. I am Evangelical Protestant, so no RC bias. But this film is highly biased, much of it done by Irish Protestants who wage war. Most of those interviewed are not fully identified--just ""university professor,"" etc. I doubt the research. Don't waste your money"
1,Wary of Christians bashing Christians,"Where is the Christian love when Movies are made to bash others for a profit purpose ! Do not judge others, and you will not be judged ! This command refers to rash, censorious, and unjust judgment. See Romans 2:1. Luke 6:37 explains it in the sense of ""condemning."" Christ does not condemn judging as a magistrate, for that, when according to justice, is lawful and necessary. Nor does he condemn our ""forming an opinion"" of the conduct of others, for it is impossible ""not"" to form an opinion of conduct that we know to be evil. But what he refers to is a habit of forming a judgment hastily, harshly, and without an allowance for every palliating circumstance, and a habit of ""expressing"" such an opinion harshly and unnecessarily when formed. It rather refers to private judgment than ""judicial,"" and perhaps primarily to the customs of the scribes and Pharisees.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"
4,Splendid,"Reinhard Seifried is a veteran German conductor, particularly of opera. His talents are well suited to conducting a work for voice and orchestra. I enjoyed this CD immensely. The orchestral playing is the equal of any orchestra you can think of, and the vocal soloists all are very good. For a rarely performed piece, the Lobesang comes off here as an intimately interpreted and passionate experience. The sound engineering is generally quite good. My one caveat has to do with the recording of the chorus. The chorus seems to sing quite well. I say seems, because in loud passages the sound of the chorus turns somewhat misty and indistinct. When you are expecting the sound to pack a wallop, it instead turns mushy. Otherwise, this is an excellent CD, a real bargain, although I note that a Sawallisch performance that I haven't heard is available at an even lower price. I expect that I will return to Seifried's performance again and again with real pleasure."
5,Superior interpretation,"I am currently reviewing 3 different versions of the 2nd Symphony and this is the most stately, emotional, fulfilling version available.Five stars"
3,Keep Looking,"I downloaded this recording based on the glowing reviews that I have read. I am going to play it on a different set of speakers but right now I am SOOOOOO disappointed.I am a choir snob. A choir should be balanced with a rich homogenous sound - especially for Mendelssohn.In this one the choir is shouty, in just the little bit that I have listend to, the Basses overshot several notes and is just a noisy raucous sound rather than the smooth rich one that I had hoped for.As with most choral works that I download, I bought it to help me learn it for an upcoming performance. Its fine for that purpose, but I read one review where the listener said that they would choose this one over the Karajan when they feel the need to be lifted closer to heaven.For me, I am nudged more in the opposite direction."
3,"Good book, but lacking","I bought this book after reading the positive reviews here. I haven't ever used any other Korean books, so I cannot compare. The book does explain grammar and pronunciation in a clear manner. However, compared to other language self-study books, it is lacking in ""feeling"" - every lesson is a short dialogue followed with a long vocabulary list, grammar explanations, and exercises. I would have preferred it if the authors included some bits about Korean culture, history, etc. or at least some simple supplemental reading material in Korean. I feel the dialogues are far too short, and only use about 30% of the vocabulary you are expected to learn. It's very hard to learn vocabulary by memorizing long lists, and it would have helped to at least see it used in the dialogue or in example sentences(there are a few, but not nearly enough). If used in a class, this would be an excellent textbook, but for self-study it's a bit dry."
4,good but...,"This textbook has been an excellent (if slightly intimidating!) tool for me - an independent learner.Of particular interest are the exercises at the end of each chapter. BUT a word of caution, I've noticed that some of the answers for Chapter 6's exercises (especially the translation ones) don't actually match the questions!Just a word of caution. I don't know if the rest of the chapters are similar."
2,Okay,"I worked my way through most of the book, but while in the process I found a website for teach Korean. I have learned a lot more from the website than the book. I feel that learning Korean through Romanized letter schemes is the wrong way to go."
5,Great buy!,"This book is great, along with some other supplemental material I can already read Korean in a few hours of studying. The cd that comes with it helps a lot with the pronunciation."
4,Great Book....Lousy CD,"Fortunately for me I had learned the basics of Hangeul before starting this book. Although the book does cover the basics of hangeul in the early chapters, the CD does not adequately support the pronounciations.(CD is very limited and the speakers speak too fast)But if you can get past this flaw, the book, from lesson 4( or 5?) is strictly hangeul and is very sytematic, challenging, but not overwhelming. I have learned a tremendous amount of Korean with this book..."
4,Trail of the Mountain Man,"Easy reading, lot's of action, only problem I had went over things already read in other of his books."
4,Good Stuff,"This book was a bit over the top in parts, but it had some really good gunfight scenes, and Smoke Jensen has a mythic quality about him. Some great dialogue about the code of the west."
5,"If you enjoy baking, you must add this to your collection.","If you enjoy baking this book is one that you should add to your collection. I have tried over 50 different recepies from this book and they have all been fantastic. The recepies are easy to follow, have few steps and do not require exotic ingredients that you never have in your cabinet."
5,Best Book of Baking Ever!,"I bought this book back in 1993 when it came out. It followed me to college where it helped me bake items for our class' bake sales (which always sold out) and kept me well fed, even on a student budget. I continued to use the book for the next decade and a half until the binding finally completely fell apart from so much use. I'm a pretty decent baker, but I've had recipes from other books not turn out well from time to time. Every recipe I've ever made from this book has worked very well.I was buying bakeware for my 22 year old niece who recently moved out and it dawned on me that she could use a copy of this wonderful book, so I ordered a used one for her and a used one for me, to replace my worn out one. It's money well spent."
5,SOO GOOD!,"i LOVE This book!!! i am currently enrolled in AP biology, and this book practically saved me from reading the monstrous textbook. im serious. this is all you need to know for the unit exams and possibly for the AP too judging by the other reviews. For unit test, i just read this book and skim over my notes...maybe look at the study guide for our campbell&reese textbook, and i've gotten over 100% on all of them. GET THIS BOOK! the barrons has more graphics/organization, but this one is definitely the best in its field. no questions."
5,A review for Biology (Cliffs AP),"This book is extremely helpful. The materials represented in it is closely associated with the 2004 AP test. The diagrams are similar to the ones that are actually on the AP test. It summarizes all the important details with brilliant organization and demonstrates a comprehensive review of lab component. I got a 5 on the exam, just like the practice test predicted. This is an indispensable tool for any scholar."
5,This book is a definite Bi-o!,"I had biology in highschool and it did me nothing. I came out of that class as clueless as ever and I expected to be a biology major! I thus picked up the Biology AP Cliff book and read and memorized everything from cover to cover. It did me well, as I earned a 5!... That is how a preparation book should work. If you read the entire book and memorize it, you will know every single answer on the test. In addition to helping me on the AP exam, I noticed it helped me for my Science Bowl Team and also I can now do well on the Biology section on the MCAT!..."
4,good enough for me,this book should be used as a guide in your studying. i recommend going over your class notes- and if you have them- the study guides that go with the cambell book. But dont crack this book open the night before and expect results. The ap test can be specific and general at the same time. This book was a basic summary of the cambell book- and if you want to get a 5 start using this book in like march and due like two or three chapters and quizzes a day. Dont wait till the last minute!!!
5,Excellent AP Book,"Cliffs AP Biology is BY FAR the best AP Biology book on the market. No other book comes close!This book is concise, effective and comprehensive at the same time. While other books use 4-10 pages to go over one topic (like photosynthesis), Cliffs AP covers the same material in 2-3 pages! The material is written in a simple and easy to understand fashion and comes complete with diagrams, pictures, charts and bolding, which make it simple to learn.Not only that, the book covers lab and has a FULL practice exam.The one thing i loved about this book was that after each section, there were 10-20 ""review quiz"" problems over the section which came complete with essay topics.I bought this book approximatly 1 week before the AP Biology exam. In class we were using the Cambells Biology book (wonderful), and i read the Cliffs AP book, did the practice problems, and got a 5 EASILY!Simply put, Cliffs AP Biology is the ONLY AP BIO book you will need."
4,Good Review guide but you have to know your stuff first,"The Cliffs AP Bio Review book is really concise. It doesn't waste time on flowery stuff like the other ones out there. If you took notes and listened in class, then this book is really good. If you did absolutely nothing in class like me, then I would recommend you to get the Princeton one along with this one. The Princeton one is basically teaching you the concepts, while this one goes into details."
5,The ONLY AP Bio book you need,"This book is great. I received a 5 on my AP test, and trust me, my teacher sucks. Phillip Pack offers concise, informative explanations that serve as good preview and review tools for your coursework. I recommend using this as a SUPPLEMENT, as sometimes it does not go into too much detail.I swear my teacher reads this. Sometimes the lectures are so similar to the same chapter it's obvious."
5,One Great Book!,"This book is the best AP Biology review manual that I found. I actually went to the bookstore and looked at the ones from The Princeton Review, Barron's, and a couple others. This book was by far the best one that I found. I then went and bought this book on Amazon.com becuase it was cheaper here.I just took the AP last May (May 16, 2001) and I would recommend this book to everyone. The summaries are in-depth with just the right amount of detail. They also had a review of all the required labs. But as always, you should do some checking around and take a look at all of them. Check the date that they were published too. By the way, I got a 5 (out of 5) on the AP."
3,Just facts,"This book is simply a collection of facts turned into vague questions. It has hardly any detailed explanations. Just facts. I mean, how much can someone memorize without understanding? And we soon tend to forget memorized facts."
2,Lukewarm,"This recording realy does nothing to excite one who already has appreciation for early music. I would compare this conservatively with Michael Bolton's attempt at opera arias. The result may be the same. There are groups of people who are not now interested in music from this genre, but may become more interested because of this release. That is my reason for granting two stars.On the other hand, those who enjoy period performance will be disappointed by the 20th century treatement, eg: ""pop"" style slurring, etc.Call me a purist, but many of the elements that awaken interest in early music for some (vitality, historical sound, etc) are missing from this release."
2,Not for the purist,"Despite Amazon.com's comments to the contrary, I suspect many early music lovers like myself will find this album either amusing or somewhat annoying. The Baebes sound like a well-schooled high school choir, brought up on folk music, attempting some serious music for a change. It could make for pleasant background music, I suppose, but I'll take my early music straight, thanks. For those interested, check out any Anonymous 4 CD's, the relatively inexpensive Medieval Experience set on Archive, anything by the Hilliard Ensemble, Philip Pickett's work, and from a somewhat later period, the incomparable Tallis Scholars and The Sixteen's Eton Choirbook series, before it disappears with all other Collins Clasics."
5,awesome,"I first heard the Baebes at a renaissance festival about 4 years ago and they were incredible. Their voices are beautiful and many of the songs are haunting. I just bought this album, i received it today, and it's beautiful. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in something different. And if you ever get a chance to see the Baebes live, don't think twice, they're great!"
1,"0 Stars really , but they wouldn't let me. Save your money.","The Mediaeval Babes is the confection of some bright spark who thought that the girlie-group formula could be joined with the music of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries to... well, to make a lot of money. I suspect that they failed: they certainly deserved to.The Babes themselves are a washed-out bunch of hopeless wanabees. Some can sing a little, none does anything well. Their music is a crude blend, tasteless, talentless pastiches of mediaeval standards alternating with phoney pretend stuff.I can't go on - The Mediaeval Babes and their CDs are truly awful. At 33c it's a rip-off, and the quoted $33.99 is criminal. Go away and get the real thing - The Spice Girls or Hildegard of Bingen, not a cheap and risible imitation of both."
5,Perfect fit,"Fit my Suzuki Ozark 250 perfectly.Mounted without having to move anything on the handlebars. High enough to channel wind over my head and wide enough to block the wind on my hands. 30sec to take on & off. My face and hands were what got cold on my 2 mile drive to work everyday, but not any more. Worth every penny for the winter driving."
1,Very Deceptive Description,"I ordered what I thought was a saxophone stand with an OPTIONAL peg for my 12 year old son for Xmas. When I got the box on Xmas eve, I thought it looked awfully small, but I wrapped it anyway. You should have seen the disappointed look on my son's face when all he had to open was a peg for a soprano sax that he doesn't own and NO stand to go with it! I have since reread the product description and it is TOTALLY deceptive! To me it still implies that I should have received a folding saxophone stand...not a soprano sax peg! I have yet to try to deal with the company. If their customer service is any good , they may redeem themselves, but based on the other review, I think all I'm going to get is a headache!"
4,Balanced and friendly critique of Freud,"Hans Kung, a Catholic theologian, pays a tribute to Freud and his groundbreaking discoveries, such as theories of libido and human unconscious. But he questions the popular view that Freud was an atheist and did not have a place for religious ideas in the scientific movement that he originated - psychoanalysis. He fights Freud's views of religion as a complex that needs to be treated. Moreover, he argues that although Freud seems outwardly an atheist, but nevertheless his negative experiences with religion, however much they discredit for him Christianity, need not have shaken Freud's Jewish faith in God. This is good and balanced work. A must read for everyone interested in Freudian psychoanalysis, Jungian psychology and spirituality."
4,lives up to its name,"There's everything I could want in this collagen booster from Ole Henriksen. It's called Truth Serum, and truth be told it has a lovely fresh, citrus aroma and absorbs immediately into the skin.Part of Henriksen's much in demand ""3 Little Wonders,"" Truth Serum is appropriate for all skin types. With its light texture it is wonderful to use in the morning and at bedtime under a moisturizer. It serves to refresh, rejuvenate and firm, leaving skin feeling silky and smooth.Among the ingredients are Sodium Hyaluronate, Green Tea, Ester-C, Vitamin E, Rosehip Extract, Orange Extract, Alpha-Lipoic Acid, Grapefruit Extract and Aloe Vera - an extremely beneficial botanical blend.Highly recommended with no reservations - not a one!- Gail Cooke"
2,Alright for a British Wall Street,Its definitely not Wall Street! But it will do from a bunch of Brits. Beware - you will have to brush up on your british do understand what is being said.
5,Great Book,"I have an original copy of this book. Its a great book, and he has some great references to pursue, ie: Thomas Newton's Discourses on the Prophecies..."" This little book can strengthen faith in the Bible as an inspired book, and it offers powerful arguments against doubters and atheists. I can't vouch for this printing of the book, but, the text is great."
1,Carb is remanufactured,Received this carb only to discover it is remanufactured not new as stated. Amazon sent another only to receive the same remanufactured carb.
5,A great amusing nautical read...,"The early episode in this wonderful book where the ""Happy Adventure"", under *FULL* sail, mysteriously backs all the way out of Muddy Hole Harbor, to the amusement of all, is worth the price of admission, in and of itself. ""By guess and by god"", this is a charming read."
4,The author's hilarious true story of life aboard a quarrelsome boat,"This must be the funniest of Farley Mowat's books, the true story of his sailing adventures off the southern coast of Newfoundland in a rickety little schooner with a mind of her own and a propensity for bad behavior. No matter how hard Mowat tries, he just can't get her to stop leaking or or even reliably follow a course. The book is so outrageous at times that it's hard to believe it's all true. This is an easy read, in thoroughly enjoyable Newfie seadog dialect, suitable for all ages. Yachtsmen and Newfoundland fans will not want to miss this book."
5,Hilarious!,"I read this book many years ago and just bought it for my son as a gift. As a previous owner of a leaky, wooden boat, I found this book to be almost non-fiction. I thoroughly enjoyed it and highly recommend it - especially to wooden boat owners."
4,"Good sense of humour, but....","The time table for this book was organized a little hurriedly. The first half of the novel takes place over one summer, and then suddenly years fly by and there is too much crammed into the last few chapters. It seems almost as though Mowat got bored of the story and decided that he'd better finish it. However, that was the only thing about this book that I didn't like. Mowat has a delightfully sarcastic sense of humour and I enjoyed his optimistic adventures thoroughly. Even the boat has a personality all her own, and his creativity was refreshing."
4,The Title tells it all,"I have to say that I found the first few chapters hard to take and if this was my first Mowat book I would have thought that he was insane. I don't want to spoil the story so I won't describe why I felt so. However, the book picks up once the voyage begins and Mowat's descriptions of nature (weather, sea, terrain)are unsurpassed. He does good descriptions of the characters that he encounters, as well. Still one of my favorite authors.My understanding is that in later books he becomes disillusioned with the Newfoundlanders and other local types."
3,Not what I expected,Thought these would produce a richer sound than they do. They are very flat and and mid-range heavy. No base from these at all. In fat the 3 inch speakers I put in the dash sould better. But these are better than the factory speakers that were in there but only just better.
2,Interesting yet toi thin,"The book is very neatly organized and contains intriguing information, but it deals in only about 80 pages with actual human communication. Most of the very short book os dedicated to general introduction to cognitive neurosience. If you want a concise introduction to the field I recommend that you look for a book with 'neurolinguistics' in the title."
4,A moreless CD,"well, what I can say about this title is that is nothing out of this world, I mean, there are too meany other soundtracks better than this, bit it has a great title: Enter the DragonBye"
1,Wrong Item Delivered,Buyers beware. Twice I received a different (cheaper) model than the one pictured and paid for. This company is substituting #HP-130DX with a coil spring for this model with the V spring.
5,"Sharpest Blade, Easiest Grip, Smooth Action","These are the best pruners I've ever used. I've been gardening for over 40 years and I love love love these! They are angled so that they are a perfect natural extension of your hand. The latch to hold them closed has a position to sit while you are working so that it will never flop over and get in your way (as every other brand seems to do). They cut easily. If they can't cut through something, then you should have started with a saw in the first place. The y shaped spring has a smooth easy action and hopefully it will withstand the test of time. I can't testify to that yet. I'm a small woman, but I wear a size large in womens gardening gloves, if that helps you figure out the size of the grip any."
1,"A boring overdone, self-pitying story","This book is lousy and boring. It absolutely pours into you with self pity. I would not reco- mmend this book to anybody. What a joke... I mean those Krishna's have helped the world. And all this lady does is complain, complain. Definetly not a book for those interested in elightment. Infact this book not only bored me but made my day worse."
3,A rare disappointment....,"As the reviewers before me have already said...this album is Nanci's worst. She sings okay, but the song selection is a bad one. I really have no interest in listening to duets with has-beens or listening to songs I have already heard a thousand times before by somebody else. Only buy this CD if you are a die-hard Nanci fan, otherwise keep away."
4,It grows on you.,"I waited so long for this c.d. to come out and then intially, I was disappointed. The first ""other voices, other rooms"" is my absolute favorite c.d. of all times. ""other voices Other rooms too, like the first one, grows on you. It is still not as good as the first but ""wings of a dove"" is great and ""wall of death"" is good enough to buy the c.d. for. it is a tremendous song and i listen to it over and over."
2,Still can't get around it,"I've had the typical fan problems with Nanci's last two albums, but unlike ""Blue Roses"", i can't get around the cluttered production, uninspired arrangements, and sheer ugliness of so many of the tracks on this album. I must admit that ""Who Knows Where the Time Goes"" is a beautiful rendition, and a small handful of others appear to be indestructible songs (although I always thought that ""Deportee"" was indestructible too). However, the whole concept of Nanci singing backup so often on her own album strikes me as extremely odd. My recommendation is that the diehards pick it up (of course, I'm sure we all already have!) and other curious parties start with ""Storms"", ""Flyer"", ""One Fair Summer Evening"", or the original ""Other Voices, Other Rooms""."
4,Between 3 and 4 stars,"There are 73 minutes in this cd, but it could have been a much better cd at 50 minutes, some songs are great, others just are not so good, not enough to be in a CD. But this cd will always be important for collectors, in it you'll find the best version of Guy Clark's Desperadoes waiting for a train, with a cast including JJ Walker, JD Guilmore, S Earle, Guy Clark,other in this cd include Lucinda williams, Tom Russell, Richard Thomspon, Ian Tyson, a great cast of songwriters and singers."
2,A Differing Opinion.....,"I loved ""Other Voices I."" But, while that album had a natural, settin'-round-the-campfire feel, ""Voices II"" sounds forced -- as if Nanci's trying to cram too many singers and songs into one CD. For example, ""Desperadoes Waiting for a Train"" almost sounds like a Highwaymen song, with no less than six singers trading leads, sometimes in the middle of sentences, never harmonizing, never connecting. I admire the range of material and singers represented -- an ""A"" for effort. But, as far as pure listening enjoyment, well, I have to rank this significantly lower than that....."
1,Sometimes You Shouldn't Make a Sequel,"As much as I like Nanci Griffith, I really cannot tolerate this CD. Some of the songs, e.g., ""Wall of Death"" just aren't that good. Others are good songs, e.g., ""If I Had a Hammer"" and ""You Were On My Mind,"" in which Nanci's rendition pales in comparison to the original. Others are songs which have recently been updated by other artists in far superior fashion, e.g., compare Los Super Seven's version of ""Plane Wreck at Los Gatos"" or James Taylor's version of ""Hard Times."" Having seen her several times in concert, and having several other of her CDs, I'm stunned that she could have produced an recording so bereft of interest. If you're a long-time Griffith follower, this CD will add nothing to your collection. If you're new to Nanci's music, look elsewhere. Otherwise, you might wonder why she has such a devoted following."
2,a flop,"if your into more of Nanci's folkabilly work, stay away from this cd. I bought other voices first, then came back and bought other voices too, what a dissapointment ""too"" was too uptown for me"
4,not as great as part I but still great,"The songs on this album, while still fine, are not quite as fresh or memorable as the selections on the first ""Other Voices"" album. They are however, well and enthusiastically performed with many guest performers (including some of the songwriters) joining in to good effect."
2,"Aggravating, disappointing, inconsistent","I'm glad it's not just me who finds Ms Griffith's pronunciations affected & aggravating. They make me think of someone striving to sing cool, tripping over a mike cord, & falling flat on their face. Some of the tracks are beauties, although most of those are just such wonderful songs that it would be tough for almost anyone to screw them up. Unfortunately, the take on Guy Clark's ""Desperados Waiting For A Train"" is not one of them. Even having Guy & Jerry Jeff, who I first heard do this 30+ years ago, don't salvage this. I see now why it was so cheap used."
1,This is as Bad as Other Voices Other Rooms was Excellent,"You get the sense that she was forced to do a follow up by her record company and she was gonna teach them a lesson. Other voices, Other Rooms is one of my favorite Albums of all time. My kids grew up listening to the Beatles, and Other Voices Other Rooms. Nancy owes the world a Re-Do of this album, this time with a straight face. You feel like you're listening to an inside joke, that just isn't funny."
2,Once was enough,"While I appreciate Griffith's efforts to expose the work of other folk singers, this one is ""precious"" in so many places that in the end it's mostly just ""irritating."""
1,Pretentious and damned-near unlistenable,"I love a lot of Nanci Griffith's work, including the first ""Other Voices, Other Rooms."" On this CD, however, several of the songs make my skin crawl. What in the world has she done to ""Wall of Death"" with her bizarre counter melody? Anyone who can listen to Nanci sing ""You Were on my Mind"" without wincing has a much stonger stomach than I. A lot of the songs are good, and I guess if I programmed the CD player to eliminate the stinkers this would be an enjoyable disc. But, like the little girl with the curl in the middle of her forehead, when Nanci is bad on this CD, she is horrid."
3,"""Wall of Death"" is the wrong song for this CD","There's no way to top the extraordinary opening of _Other Voices, Other Rooms_. Griffith's voice and style are perfect for Kate Wolf's ""Across the Great Divide"". It was a brilliant mix, one that set the tone perfectly for the songs to follow. It was a triumph! In comparison,the second CD, despite its strengths, can only appear second-tier. The curiosities of ""Wall of Death"" are only that--curiosities; the song in fact seems quite out of place. ""Streets of Baltimore"" and ""Yarrington Town"" are classics, but they lose a bit of their luster on a CD opened by a song as elliptical and remote as ""Wall of Death""."
4,An aquired taste...like single malt scotch or dry wine,"Like many others I did not particularly like this album when I first played it. But the more I played it the more it grew on me. It's like dry wine--you have to aquire a taste for it. But once that taste is aquired you cannot get enough. Great collection of songs. Summer Wages has always been one of my favorites. Although I don't mind the throat clearing at the beginning, Desperadoes waiting for a Train is a bit much with all the extra singers. I do like ""Wasn't That a Mighty Storm"" and ""Wings of a Dove."""
1,Disappointing,"Griffith's versions of most of these songs sound forced and overwrought (""Wall of Death,"" one of my favorite songs, is particularly terrible here). At least most of the songs on the first CD match her style."
2,Nanci's Vocal Affectations Ruin Otherwise Fine Outing,"It's always refreshing to hear new takes on favorite songs. The arrangements on this fine selection of tunes by a sterling collection of writers are wonderful. The playing, while not inspired, is more than competent. What ruins it for me is the weird vocal affectation Nanci brings to so many of the songs. Not only is it irritating, it's not even consistent. Nanci - if you're going to pronounce ""friend"" as ""frayund"" at least do it each time. I own each of Nanci Griffith's CDs but, frankly, if I'd heard this one before I bought it, I'd have skipped it."
1,Extreme disappointment for a devoted fan.,"I have followed Nanci Griffith's career for years. As a singer/songwriter, I have the utmost respect for Miss Griffith's soulful performance and writing gifts. I am also in awe of Other Voices, Other Rooms. This second venture, however, was a disappointing buy for me. More often than not, Nanci was overshadowed by lackluster performances of other artists. Many of the harmonies were quite painful to hear. I will continue to follow and support Nanci's career. Let's have another Flyer!"
1,Pass on this one ...,"From a fan who has most of Nanci's CD's, this one is extremely disappointing. Her guests overshadow Nanci's voice on almost every selection. A more appropriate title: ""A Bunch of Mostly Mediocre Songs on Which Nanci Griffith Sings Back-Up"". If I could give this CD zero stars I would."
1,Disappointing,"When I heard that Nanci Griffith had produced a sequel to Other Voices, I rush out and purchased it. A mistake, but I have made them before. The choice of musical selections has an uncertain feel to it. It has the feeling as being made up from selections that should have been left on the editing room floor. The performance of the Stephen Foster selection was unflattering to the writer and was work to listen to. Emmylou Harris did a much better rendition in her Live at the Ryman album. This is the first dud that I have purchased that Nanci Griffith released. It can be summed up as ""Not up to Her Quality."""
1,Waste of Money,"As a fan of Nanci Griffith's earlier work, I eagerly went to the CD store and got the first copy the store released. But then I listened to this piece of trash. Disappointing doesn't begin to describe my feelings. What happened to the brilliance displayed in Other Voices Other Rooms? Her voice went south, her arrangements went south, and her harmonies went south (Bountiful must be in the South). This CD is a dud no matter how many times I have listened to it. Save your money and hope she records another CD (I wish I had). It HAS to be better."
3,other voices other rooms was better but...,"yes, I believe that this album is not her best, but give it a break. How many performers these days do you see paying tribute to thier ""heroes""? Nanci pays her respect to these people by doing thier songs, ""imitation is the sincerest form of flatery"". She did not write these songs, she just covers them. Nanci has been one of the more real people in music lately, and contrary to some peoples belief, she has not ""sold out"", and I vigorously await her next release."
2,Disappointing...,"I looked forward to Nanci's new CD and ordered it right away. Unfortunately, I am very disappointed with it. I am a big fan and have about 12 of her CDs, but this one will probably not be played often. Nanci does little singing and what she does do isn't as good as other CDs. Often she and the other artists do not mix well and some songs sound as if they are beginners. I hope Nanci goes back to some of her other styles. The title of this CD should more accurately reflect the contents. It is not a Nanci Griffith CD; she simply supports many other singers and songwriters."
3,"Not as good as Other Voices, Other Rooms","Maybe the selection of songs was too varied but ""Other Voices, Too"" lacks cohesion. Individual tracks are fine as stand alones but it's mildly jarring going from one to the next. It doesn't have the flow and emotional pull of ""Other Voices, Other Room"" though I don't regret buying it. I like hearing performers doing covers, showing us their influences and heroes.(If you're looking to be introduced to Nanci Griffith, I'd recommend ""One Fair Summer Evening"" as the first purchase.)"
5,SOME SAY BEST EVER !!!,"SOME SAY THIS IS DO OR DIE'S BEST ALBUM ,BUT I DON'T THINK SO PERSONALLY.THIS ALBUM ""VICTORY"" IS GOOD DON'T GET ME WRONG ,BUT IT'S MISSING TRAXSTER BEATS.BUY THIS ALBUM IS WORTH YOUR MONEY.CHI-TOWN , WEST SIDERAP-A-LOT RECORDS"
5,BEST DO OR DIE ALBUM EVER !,"THIS ALBUM IS THE BEST.THE BEATS ARE STRAIGHT.THE WORDS ARE ILL.DO OR DIE IS NOW ON A LEVEL WHERE EVERYONE CAN LISTEN TO THEM.WHEN A CHITOWN ARTIST HAS A NEW YORK OR L.A. ARTIST FEATURED ON IT THEN YOU KNOW A ALBUM IS GOOD.THE GOOD TRACKS ARE 1,2,5,7,8,9,10,13,14,16.BUY THIS ALBUM RIGHT NOW.YOU WILL HAVE NO REGRETS."
3,It's alright,Stick to their old one /Heads or Tails /because that was sweet. This album as a few cuts but the second album is much better.
2,What Happened?,"I don't know what happened to Do or Die on this album. Their first two albums were tight. Both of them had tha laid back pimp beats. On this album. it's almost as if they did a 360. The only two songs that remind you of tha old Do or Die are In a Mode and You Already Know. With this album you can't even compare them to tha original flow fathers, BONE THUGS N HARMONY. I was very upset that I spent my money on this album. Next time I'll listen before I buy."
3,In A Mode is the only great track on here,"This is easily Do Or Die's weakest album to date. Production is for the most part below-average, and their lyrics have gone south.That being said, Victory would get just one star if it weren't for In A Mode, which is quite possibly the greatest Do Or Die track ever. This cut is smooth: it can be played over and over again and it won't get tiring. Other than that, there is not much else to be excited about. Already Know is a good track, and If U Scared & Keep It Real are alright. Who Knows has a strong Daz / Whoridas sounding hook, but other than that it's a sub-par track.Tracks 10-16 on this album are pure garbage. Murderers, Pimps, & Thugs is just flat-out wack. No other word can describe it more accurately.Overall, this is a very weak album, outside of In A Mode and a few other good tracks. If it's fast-flows and bangin beats you crave, pick up the new albums from Sandman and Flesh-n-Bone, and pass on Victory."
1,Can I get my money back please?,"What the hell were they thinking? I feel so cheated. I absolutely loved ""Headz or Tailz"", but they could've kept this garbage. I think out of the whole album only three songs appeal to me. I am from Down South so, I like my music to be hard core, and this album just doesn't cut it for me."
2,THIS IS ALRIGHT CD,THE BEST CD IS THE FIRST. THIS CD IS OKAY. IT'S ABOUT 3 GOOD SONGS. oKAY ALBUM NOT WORTH A CD . NOT WORTH THE PUSH BACK RAP A LOT DID. IT RATES ABOUT 2.8.
1,Unbelievable....,"I am a HUGE Do or Die fan. I love their music. I love the fact that they played a big part in bringing attention to my hometown. These guys are part of the ""REAL CHICAGO"". Now that I've said that, this album, ""Victory"" should have never been released. This should have been one of those lost albums that get leaked onto the internet around 2015. The songs on this album should have been scrapped and salvaged what could be used to make a quality project."
2,much better than Stephen King,"Still targets a squarely middle brow audience. Also, seems very dated, rooted in the '50's.Most of the stories are of the ""Twilight Zone""/""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"" form and structure. I.e., creepy setting, followed by twist ending. And this is more of a fantasy and supernatural book than science fiction.There is a lot of erudition on display here, but it is the fussy, showy kind often displayed by the autodidact. The pace and economy of some of the stories suffer because unnecessary erudition is packed in with everything else."
5,A writer's writer,"Avram Davidson was a strange and quirky writer, whom I never fully appreciated when I was younger. His stories defy explanation, just read and enjoy them. His best known piece is here, the one about the bicycles. It was just as funny and inventive as I remembered."
5,No Safer place on Earth!,Reading Joyce Ann Edmondsons journals and life quest in seeking a relationship with God mirrors my own quest. He devotion to God and her Heart to continually seek Him is an inspiration to us all. She imparts a security and peace that only someone in the Arms of the Great Shepherd would have. It is truly the safest place on Earth to be and I was priveleged to read of her Journey there and the people she had influenced along the way. A wonderful read of inspiration and heart!
3,"ok basics, but somewhat dated","i haven't finished it yet, but it's a fair book on basics. For me the book was a little too basic; i already knew things like how to pay your mortgage early.For the price, its a decent primer, but it is also somewhat dated... written in 2000/2001, some of the discussion seems behind."
1,Book of Common Sense without Substance,"Save money by sewing your own clothes! Put yourself on a budget! I was shocked at how little info this nearly 300-page book offered (and the number of exclamation points used). I forced myself to read the entire book, thinking that I would learn something -- unfortunately not. This book would only be suitable for someone truly lacking a shred of common sense, and even then I suspect the reader would finish the book without a real sense of where to start when it comes to financial planning for a family (let alone for an individual)."
1,unreliable information,"I bought this book strictly for the chapter on college savings advice. Admittedly, I have only read one chapter, but found the information pretty general and presented in a way that often left my questions unanswered.Even worse, the authors don't have all their facts right. For example, they say that the earnings on college 529 plans are subject to taxation once you start withdrawing from the account. I did a little more research--this is just plain wrong. Until the year 2010, all gains are, in fact, completely sheltered. This is a pretty serious error for a personal finance book to make, especially when your children's education is at stake.I wish I could comment about the rest of the book, but I don't trust it."
5,Best piece of winter clothing I have!!!,"I wanted some decent pants for winter sports: cycling, XC skiing, jogging. These pants are simply remarkable. They are a thick, stretchy material that blocks wind and keeps you remarkably warm! The stretch form-fitting (not tights though) material does not bind when doing activities. In very cold weather, a simple base layer thermal underneath (under 35*F). Can't say enough of this pair of pants. FYI, I bought mine from The Bean when they had a sale and it was only slightly cheaper than the Amazon price, which is definitely worth it. I didn't know they could spin polypropylene into a cloth but it definitely works. Take care when washing and hang it up to dry.Edit: be careful when putting on or talking of the pants, when the front pleat stitching (cosmetic down the entire front) becomes over-stretched, it'll tear easily."
5,running pants,my husband loves them and he says they are very warm-awesome pants to run outside in when it's cold or just around the house
1,Agree with Scott Tessier,"This book was assigned in a graduate level international relations class. While the aim of the book is laudable - to give practical solutions to foreign policy problems - the execution leaves much to be desired. The editors make each contributing author shoehorn their essays into a rather clumsy outline. There are countless ""no **** Sherlock"" moments when reading this book. Overall, it is not insightful and an utter waste of time."
1,This book should come with a free supply of caffeine,"This is by far, without a doubt, the single-handedly most God-awfully, hideously sterile, boring piece of literature ever produced by mankind. I have heard a rumor that hospitals are going to start making patients read this book in lieu of anaesthesia before conducting surgery."
5,Jan Pienkowski's books are priceless!,"Doorbell is a story written with humorous rhyming sentences. It is filled with pop-up characters, and a battery-operated ""doorbell"" so the kids can interact with each page. This book is sturdy enough for most ages. I'm nearly 40 years old, and I can't get enough of it!"
5,One of Bolitho's best,"It almost gets repetitive, but this one rates with Kent/Reeman's best in a superb series. Good story, thrilling action, great scenes and exchanges between Bolitho and Herrick, Allday, & Adam. The usual excellent descriptive writing, this time of conditions in the Baltic during winter, was of great help when reading it in a crowded bus in San Francisco when the temperature was an unbelievable 103."
1,Ugh...,"This is really a horrible dvd...its a whole bunch of clips that leave you hanging.... you dont know whats going on the whole time, and its 19 3 or 4 minute tracks of different misc. video clips. most of these are choppy and at horrible angles....it should be titled ""The Real World You Didnt Want To See"" Its really pointless. Plus all the nudity is still blocked...for those who were anxious to know...."
2,Short and Boring,"I enjoy watching the Real World on MTV, so I was looking forward to viewing this DVD.Some of the segments were boring.I was disappointed because the DVD is too short. MTV records the cast 24/7 so you'd think there would be more footage to share on this DVD. Not so."
2,You Can Live Without Seeing It,"I loved the Real World Chicago. So, I was really psyched to be able to see some of the behind the scenes material. I was even more disappointed once I saw it.What they have thrown together is only mildly entertaining. A story about a bird getting loose in the house, nicknames the cast came up with, and how they ""uncover"" the Real World filming vault in the basement. Yawn.This was a really strong cast with some really different personalities and I was hoping they would have shown some of the ways those personalities clashed. A DVD should have opened up opportunities to show stuff you couldn't show on TV - they completely missed the boat on that. All of this material (with VERY few exceptions) could have been shown on TV, as is.If you are truly a die-hard Real World Chicago fan, look for this DVD secondhand. Anyone else is better off taking a pass on it. A real wasted effort."
3,The Real World You Never Saw - Chicago,"I had started watching the movie with minimal expectations. The movie featured some funny segments such as Aneesa's special ""friend"" and Tonya's extensive vocabulary. I didn't think the movie was that funny though. I was hoping for a lot more. Compared to previous ""You Never Saw""s, this one wasn't that great. If you have watched the season and have a few extra bucks, get the movie. It isn't a must though."
2,Weak Effort for a Good Season,"i wasn't expecting much when i purchased this dvd (after all, the main feature only runs a scant 44 minutes) and after viewing it my expectations were not wrong. Some of the material edited here are just plain boring (The Lobster Game, The bird that flew into the Loft...WHO CARES) to the briefly covered (escapades in the group showers segments lasts a mere 1 minute!). Compared with past RWYNS discs, this is a weak effort and replay value is minimal. Again, the topics covered are not as compelling or funny as previous editions. It's such a shame coming from a good cast. I've always considered it strange that these RWYNS discs are released singular from a complete season set for the respective season when the RWYNS Dvds should be and are the bonus features found on similar tv show boxed sets. Even though with its shortcomings, the disc has some easter eggs that are pretty funny albeit short, at 14 seconds a piece ( i see a trend here)."
5,Loved It!,It was great seeing the cast again and the behind-the-scenes looks are really funny. Worth what I paid and then some! Definitely recommend it!
4,Only for die hard fans,"If you set your VCR every tuesday, and visit all of the fan websites, then this DVD is for you. It shows you produciton info as well as funny cast moments.Do not buy this DVD if you have seen the show a lot, but are not totally obsessed, because you will be dissapointed."
5,Great Night Cream,As a very dry skin person this makes my skin feel very soft and moisturized. I don't know how it would wrk for you oily skin folks.
3,Not great but not terrible,The storyline is kinda sketchy but the cast is pretty fun....the only real problem I have with the series is the ink spilling on the screen during the fight scenes....its annoying and serves no purpose and is the main reason I'm rating this as low as I am
4,TOO MUCH SPECULATION! | !NOITALUCEPS HCUM OOT,"- You won't believe it, but this book has left no mark in me!|!em ni kram on tfel sah koob siht tub ,ti eveileb t'now uoY -"
3,"Pretty Good, But Should've Been Better","If I had my druthers, this disc would've been a handy ""summing up"" of Gary Numan's output during the period 1984 - 1998. But unfortunately, it didn't quite come out that way. Some of the song selection is spot-on - ""America"", ""Berserker"", ""A Question of Faith"", ""My Dying Machine"" and so forth. We even are given the rare 7"" forms of several tracks, which to me is a plus (I've already got the album versions). But there's several tracks that are harder to account for. Why so many ""'98 workings"" of songs? Why (yet another) live version of ""Cars""? Yeah, this wasn't the most fertile time of his career, but certainly ""My Breathing"", ""Cold Warning"" and so forth would've fit better than a revisited ""Metal"". The re-recording tracks aren't bad at all, but they'd sound better somewhere besides a ""best of"" collection. Stilll, there's a fair amount to like here - it's just distressing to see obvious filler when there didn't need to be any."
5,It's Batman!,Must I say more? Yes because they want me to say more than It's Batman in the description. It is BATMAN!
3,Theme Song is Different : (,Fine episode. Probably worth the emmy award it recieved way back in 1992. But I give three stars because of the theme song. This is different than the original theme song and it's a real bummer! The original Batman the Animated Series theme was dark and added a lot of mistique to the show. Got you in the mood to watch the vigilante fight crime. The intro here is just some montage of different super hero shows. It really takes away from the experience.
3,Average Set of Flash Cards,"The material on the cards is fine (no problem here). The problem I have with the set that was sent me was that they are not printed on card stock. I bought this set due to good reveiws and statements that they are sturdy. I like the contents, but am not at all happy with how flimsy these cards are. They are printed on a paper stock (not a card stock). In my opinion these are very cheap cards and will not hold up to average use.There are good cards out there that are sturdy (Thicker stock). The set sent to me is nice in that is a collection, but is useuless in how fragile they are. The half boxes holding each set fell apart while we opeend them."
5,Great For Historiography!,"This book is a great supplement for history students. It is short and to the point, it reads well and it has valuable information about integrating sources into term papers, theses and dissertations. It provides how-to information on writing historically that other writer's manuals do not."
2,Outdated Style Sheet...Doesn't Address Web Sources,"With a 1998 copyright, one might expect this manual to be a bit outdated. It's unfortunate, because otherwise, it's an excellent reference at a very inexpensive price. The section on electronic sources doesn't adequately deal with the proliferation of electronic databases, websites, and other new media. You'd be better off using one of the many free online MLA formatting pages available on university websites."
3,cannot program,"i bought this for my husband, for an older model tv which is on the list but he cannot get it to work, so not sure if it works or not, will try again when we have a lot of time he has to use the on enter on enter on enter till it works a pain"
4,Very easy to Use!,"Bought these for a class and they worked quite well. The thickness of the laminate is not that great, but good enough for casual use. Can't say they would wear well as a daily ID tag long term though."
3,Not My Favorite Backing Band,"I Love Jeff Beck. This is not my favorite backing band. They sound synthetic and un-inspired! Nothing really against them. Just this ""Live"" recording could be better!"
4,Good but not jeff's best,"The asking price is insane! I bought this disk from Jeff's website for $15 plus S&H. The disc is great but it's raw & raunchy, sort of harsh... Don't buy at this price; go to Jeff's website and buy the ""Official Bootleg USA 2006"" much better recording and it sells for just $15 plus S&H..."
2,Jeff Beck Continues to Disappoint.......and continues,"I am a 52 year old guitarist and Jeff beck has had a big influence on my playing career. I really used to hold his playing in high regard. Why? Two words....melody and tastefulness. Listen to the beauty of the lead work on the old Curtis Mayfield love song ""I'm So Proud"" on the Beck Bogart and Appice LP. Listen to the intrumentals on the older Jeff Beck Group LPs, and hear him make a slide guitar sound like an angel weeping. Jeff used to have a sensitvity that I considered unmatched on electric guitar. But he has lost his way. I don't know what happened...but he has simply lost his way. He has become a techno noise machine. Push a button and hear Jeff make more noise. On the A@E BB King special, he could not even play a decent simple blues lead ....he just kept doing little tricks.....making little noises. More tricks...more noises...no melody..no taste.(sighs)"
1,disappointing and for sale,"I am Jeff Beck Fan. I saw him the last time in RAH 2004 (I come from the Netherlands). But this CD is crap. To much noise, he didn't play well. It is like he is nervous.It is a shame that he released this live CD."
1,Lacks the magic of Crossroads 07,"Beck's performance at the Crossroads festival 2007 was amazing. After seeing that on DVD I would have expected more of the same on this live set. The Crossroads performance was a a great mix of guitar, bass, drums and keyboards. This album is all about Beck overplaying playing his guitar with little support from a backing band."
3,It's long overdue,"I agree with Vicente. Does anyone know where I can get a CD with his recording of ""At the Zoo"" by Simon & Garfunkel?"
4,exquisito,"El producto llego en buenas condiciones y a tiempo, excelente servicio. Voya a recomendar es servicio a otros clientes.cliente satisfecho."
3,Not the best of Perlman,"Perlman's 1 and 5 caprices are the best of all 24 caprices recordings. Maybe when he plays chords (the caprices are full of them) is not perfect, but correct.Is a good interpretation of the caprices. Is better than Rabin, Ricci and Accardo.But I recommend Frank P. Zimmermann(the best) and Midori recordings."
2,Different laws of gravity in NY?,This device looked cool out of the box but simply would not work. Tried several different bottles of wine. All with no luck.
4,This CD is much better than their first...,"This CD ""Am I My Brothers Keeper"" is much better than their first CD..You will most likely like at least 10-15 songs on this album which has 23 songs...My favorites are ""Out of Town B's"", ""We Don't Care"", and of course the title track ""Am I My Brothers Keeper..You will like this album..I say..4 stars for NO LIMIT!!!"
3,IT's aint the best nolimit album,Kane and Abel came with it on 2 tracks on the album and thats about it. I can't Knock nolimit neither p because he has money i Could only dream of having but if you gone keep putting out albums at least drop 6 or 7 hot tracks on a joint. hollaThe greatest
2,"I want to like it, but Kane and Abel just don't seem abel.","I chose this CD due to the fact that I had not heard much about this duo after their debut release "" The 7 Sins"". After I head it I learned why. The two squabble and preach gangsta, thug, playa, hustla, big willy, dope slangin' rhymes throughout their 80 minute sophmore album. Very few cuts are tolerable enough to listen to the whole way through. Even with guests such as Snoop Dogg, Mystikal, and Master P, the ""Killa Corleone Capone"" himself (among others), this album still only stands at half mast. While the days of ""3-2-Murder-1"" and ""Git Paid"" on the freshman album, are still bout it, bout it, Kane and Abel have just became even more sloppy and chauvenistic than before. Inspirational message to Mr. Kane and Mr. Abel, ""Quit while you're behind. It was amusing at first, but this is getting ridiculous."" Stay bout it and rowdy, y'all. Peace."
4,Absolute classic,"This album surprised me. I didn't know what to think when I first saw it. I figured it would have the classic No Limit beats and productions. But, Kane & Abel have distinct vocals that set them apart from other rappers. You can tell they got that street credential..and they show it. The production on this cd blew my mind. They've got crazy flows and amazing cuts all throughout the album. Check out song number 6 with snoop dogg. This is one of the best bet layouts in any song. Plus, number 10 is one of the realest rap songs ever compiled. Kane & Abel come off harder on this track than I ever thought they could. I know gangsta rap, and this entire cd shocked me...for real. Be surprised at song number 4, a tupac remake from ""2pacalypse now"". When I herd that song, I knew Kane & Abel were for real. Get this album. Don't be embarassed to own a No Limit cd. A real rap fan will appreciate this album. Go get it!!!"
3,OK,"Kane and Abel come back again with their second LP on No Limit Records. This is the best cd they have put out after all the horrible music they put out after leaving No Limit. This album was produced by Beats by The Pound(Now as the Medicine Men). Kane and Abel rap about the only thing they know, crime, sex, violence, ghetto, and drugs. They use old elements from other songs like on ""Time After Time"" and ""Solider Story"". This album has too much bland music and they don't ever change their formula, with too many cameo apperances from below average rappers makes this LP boring. You can't tell whos Kane and whos Abel. Don't get me wrong the twinz can rhyme and they are one of the best on the tank. But with too many tracks, too many cameo apperances, and familiar formulas makes this album seem like a No Limit Compilation than a KAne and Abel cd. I would pick this up cause it does have good tracks but think to yourself, how much of the same formula can No Limit keep puting out for consumers to digest"
5,so so goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood!,"one of the best No Limit-Releases ever! the twins really spit game and Beats By The Pound made a lotta fine beats for this one.my favs are ""Stress"", ""Ghetto Day"" and track #3 with Master P & Fiend. go get it!"
4,a great cd from the best bone memba,this is a great cd at first i thought it would suck cause i heard thugs cry but the other songs are just straight bumpin all the songs are good although what he raps about isnt new he has a unique rapping style which cant be imitated the only setback on this cd was thugs cry i mean its ok but the chorus this is what it sounds like? but other than that fact that the cd is only 45 or minutes long ItS real good couldve been an 5 if it was longer
5,WOW...BETTER THAN ANYTHING...,I just wanna say straight up that this version of Tori Alamaze's Don't Cha is way better than that one of Pussycat Dolls...Don't get me wrong them Pussycat Dolls did copy her lyrics and style quite all right yet Busta Rhymes killed it totally...WAY...Anyways this O.G. Original style TORI ALAMAZE does a way better job and give MAD props to her for making it...Awesome song and recommend TORI's version a whole lot better...AND THATS ON THE REAL!!!Junior MoralesP.S. Like I said don't be confused with the real voice that did this song justice...TORI ALAMAZE...
3,Fairly Good Sampling,"This Back TO Back series provides a Good Sampling of the Sylvers (aside from ignoring the Casablanca Years), but as for Shalimar it falls short. I reccomend a Greatest Hits for them, however on the Sylvers side all the early hits are here including the Full Version of ""Hotline."""
5,For those who want to hear some of the EPs.,"This is a very good singles collection. it has all of the stuff from the beginning of the band all the way to the end of the Second Major Line up (Wattie, Gary, Big John, Danny), so don't expect Jesus is Dead and War now eps on this."
1,Absolutely dreadful,"There cannot possibly be any other recording of Elektra to beat this one for comprehensive awfulness. Anny Konetzni sounds desperate throughout and ducks most of the high notes completely, taking the lower octave. Daniza Ilitsch has a mind-bogglingly ugly voice and sounds like an absurd caricature of a wicked witch. The recording sounds as though the singers have been recorded from the other side of a heavy-duty mattress, shouting through megaphones in an enormous bathroom . The sound does bring out some interesting orchestral detail, mainly in the strings, but only at the expense of any realistic balance. My star is for Mödl, who sings impressively and intelligently as Klytemnestra. With daughters like this you want to hand her the axe straightaway and give her a head start. If you want a good, low-price Elektra I would suggest the recording with Varnay, Rysanek and Fischer on Gala - the whole cast is fantastic and the sound is much better than this."
1,A disaster,"Despite the paradoxically blazing yet strictly controlled conducting of the legendary conductor Dimitri Mitropoulos, this performance is a vocal disaster. Anny Konetzni, past her prime, has not notes above high A flat and her attempts at high C emerge as yelps. Daniza Ilitsch is an acidic Chrysothemis and Hans Braun a dull Orest. Martha Modl presents a Klytaemnestra in her vocal prime and the ease of the top notes is evidence that she was embarking on dramatic soprano parts at that time."
1,A disaster,"Other than the paradoxically blazing out in splendor yet rigorously controlled conducting of the late great Dimitri Mitropolous, this live performance from Florence is a vocal disasster. Anny Konetzni in the title role, past her prime, has no notes above A flat. Her attempts at high Cs emerge as yelps. Daniza Ilitsch is an acidic Chrysothemis and Hans Braun a boring Orest. Only Modl, a Klytaemnestra in her vocal prime, is satisfying. Her top notes ring out which indicate that at that time she was in transition to hochdramaticsche roles."
3,Not a universal fit,Tray serves its purpose which was to get the wipes off the table top but the design is poor. They could use adjustable clips for different changing tables. The hooks to hold it onto the table were way to big for my changer. I had to fold a blanket a few times and fold the blanket over the top of the changing table rail to get the tray to stay in place. Adjustable slider hooks would fix the problem easily. I guess these are only good on changing table with realllly wide rails!
1,Bad Bubbles,"I bought one of these at Walmart- it was $9, how could I resist?What a piece of junk! Its easy to overfill, the bubbles drool over the edge and drip down the surface it sits on... and then 2 weeks later, it just decided to stop working.I would never buy one again. :-("
2,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"This bubble machine was a pain while it worked, it was super messy and would only work with the expensive bubble solution. It burned through batteries and solution very quickly and stopped working all together after about 10 uses... I'm now looking for another bubble machine."
4,bubbles aplenty,"This battery operated bubble machine is worth the discounted price. It produces lots of bubble in small and medium sizes. Because it does not have to be plugged in we used it inside and outside. In order for it to work properly it does need to be filled with quite a lot of liquid bubbles. But with the price of a gallon of bubble liquid at $1 at the dollar store, it was not a problem. Just make certain you rinse out the reservoir when you are not going to use it for a while. That way the bubble liquid does not evaporate and make the components sticky. Luckliy for us it did not sit for too long; so I was able to get it working again."
3,Bubbles all over!,"It was all the fun that we expected! Just one thing... It doest not have different blow speed, so you have to be aware of that in order to take care because your home could be a big mess in just a second!!It is a great product and we enjoyed a lot at my son's birthday!! His friends loved it!!"
2,"Worth the $20.00, nothing more",We used this for our dog. He seemed to like it. The bubbles worked very well. It took alot of bubble liquid to get it to work though. So we feel like we ended up wasting a lot. It was hard to empty the remainng bubbles out of the machine when finished. It was worth the $[...] but that I wouldn't pay any more than that. Not worth it.
4,It's Got No Fatal Flaw,"There is no denying that the sound on this performance is nothing short of amazing. I almost wish this had come out as a live CD instead of a DVD because the visuals, although fairly interesting, are sometimes painful to watch. What I mean by that is that Todd just doesn't look healthy anymore, he had defied his age for years but it seems to have caught up with him.That is not to say that his voice isn't superb, it really is on this performance. I think it may just be the hair, it's time to make it all one color Todd you are almost sixty!That notwithstanding, this is the best DVD Todd has offered up since Live in Japan and the song selection is great, its not a rehash of the old catalogue, it's fresh and a treat to listen to. The only thing I missed was Kasim handling a lead vocal on at least one song as he did in Rochester, NY (He sang a cover version of ""Expressway to Your Heart"")This is a great DVD and a fine addition to your Todd collection or a great way to start it."
4,Very Good Todd concert,"If you like Todd's Liar cd you will like this DVD. If you want to see him play a lot of guitar, this is not the dvd for that. The audio-video are good, and the backup band is very good. For many of the songs, Todd just sings. PS Stay away from ""live in San Francisco"" that stinks."
1,Not true to size,"Packaged nicely, seem like a quality build, but don't fit me. I ordered the XL (34-36) and I am just about a size 35, and they felt like a 33-34 on me. All the other boxers in size 34-36 I ordered fit me fine. No real way to return them since they come straight from thailand."
1,what is this book about,this book is about a girl's strugels to go to school and how she had her dream of going to school she wrote a letter to her mom saying that she wanted to go school because she didnt wanted to stay home and work she wanted to go to school
5,You have to hear this!!!!!!,"I've had this cd for 2 years I think. I heard it, oh, maybe 3 times before today. While working on my final take home test I decided to put it on. Finally it dawned on me what gem I had and did not know it. I've paid attention to Rachmaninov's piece a bit more. The 3 times I heard it I could not understand Ravel's work. I think it was because I missed the second movement.THIS IS A MOST BEAUTIFUL CD. Tonight I heard this cd more than all the times I've had it for 2 years. A MUST HAVE!! The piano player is also excellent."
3,Blow the Trujmpets Loudly,Inspiring story. Item was shipped quickly. it started to fall apart as soon as I started reading it. Not the seller's fault
3,A police story in Greece,"It is a very good police story, but the facts that happened with the greek things and the story of the doctor that found that thing has nothing to do with the story of the book or the revolution of Greece"
3,great beginning,"The story grabbed me from the start I found myself unable to put it down Unfortunately near the end, there was just this constant feel of despair. he is born with an amazing talent and just cannot use it at all! Also that he is an outcast; we get it , okay so why insist on harping on it One just never get that sense of satisfaction and hope that I look for in any story. it all just becomes too hopeless and why is there even a story about him if he will never succeed in anything and never have a single friend!It needed comic relieve OR atleast a solid idea that all the good guys are not hopeless and weak."
3,Hard to keep interested in it,"I don't hate the story, it seems good, but it was easy to put down, put off, and stop reading. Some other book always seems to supplant this one, so I guess I am just not that invested in the story or the characters. I still haven't finished reading it, have read maybe 4 or 5 other books since starting this one. I never decided to just dump the book though, so maybe I will get back to it..."
4,An Enjoyable Tale,"Fantasy followers will enjoy this tale of young Fitz as he grows from a young boy to become an Assassin's apprentice. Though not as complex as many other works of fantasy, Robin Hobb creates characters you can believe in (and come to root for), as well as villains to root against. An easy read - perfect for the beach or plane. A fun story - you will want to read the next book (and the one after that, too!)."
3,Heh!,"It was well written, but to me it was missing something. Very slow read, sort of a forced finish for me. B+"
2,Slow paced and very boring,I admit that I could not finish this book...it was simply too boring and slow paced a read. I am tired of fantasy novels that attempt to create a complexe political world without action. This is mostly political court intrigue. Tiring to read.
5,I was edutained.,"I love all of Robin Hobb's books because she can whisk me away into a fantasy world, but still teach me something. I love fantasies, but since Robin is so wise, I always come away feeling like I learned how to be calmer and more present from her characters, too. I know that sounds odd, but you know what I'm talking about if you've read her books. There are few fiction writers that can compel me to read so late on a weeknight that I feel like crap the next day at work, but Robin Hobb is one of them. Make sure you start with the Farseer Trilogy before you read the rest. All her series were written in the order that you should read them. I read them out of order, which was perfectly fine, but I wish I had read them in order so I could have tracked the character development better."
3,"Imaginative, but tedious","Hood has a knack for constructing intriguing plot lines, but the story fell short on its characters. Where it engaged in dialogue, it was great, but too often the story was told from a distance and was much like reading a somewhat boring recount of events. Hopefully, Hood learns to spend more time unfolding characters through dialogue and action and less time constructing plot from a narrative distance."
1,"Be prepared to STOP reading after book 1, or don't read it at all.","Be warned: while Assassin's Apprentice is well paced and provides interesting settings and characters for its 460 pages, that is not so for the following two books. Royal Assassin has 752 pages, the setting is just Buckkeep, and for about 500 pages Fitz is just whining over what happened in book one. Assassin's Quest has 837 pages, and while the quest theme increases the pace a bit, the book does in no way live up to expectations. The charming 11 year old hero Fitz of book 1 develops neither brains nor balls, and Hobb has no idea how a 16 - 20 years old boy thinks or reacts, or has forgotten it. (Read the 1- and 2-Star-Reviews of R.A. and A.Q.!) So though I enjoyed Assassin's Apprentice, at the end I felt the only thing it did was tricking me into reading books 2 and 3 and thereby wasting so much of my time, not counting the money."
2,Too slow and empty.,"Slow, boring, with an ending worthy of Dean Kooontz (a dog magically saves a character), I can't possibly recommend this poorly written book to anyone. There's no satisfaction to be had."
2,The moral of the story is dumb,"There's almost nobody to like or admire in this book. The story is interesting and the world is unique enough to catch the interest of seasoned fantasy enthusiasts. However, that's about it. Almost everyone in this book is loathsome, and the likable characters end up dis likable in the end. The ending is the most frustrating part: go ahead and murder or cripple people. Nobody will care in the end and there will be almost no consequences. It's one thing for the bad guys to get away, or to wonder 'who done it?' so you have a reason to read another book. It's a completely different story when everyone knows who the bad guy was, he was caught, and nothing happens to him. I was so angry at the ending that I have no desire to read anything else related to this series."
3,yea it's good but....,"I have to say I've read all 3 of these and the writing is good and Robin definitely knows how to close out a book unlike some authors (take note Robert Jordan).However i only gave this book 3 stars because it has the word assassin in the title, so i was really expecting a good bit of emphasis on his training his methods, and maybe some of his kills and how they affect the kingdom and yadda yadda yadda, anyway the book is still good i was just looking for something else i suppose."
1,Amateurish and uneventful,"I got about halfway through this book and despite wanting to put it down forever decided to wade through until the end just to see if the story and the characters redeem themselves. Sadly, it and they did not in the least. The writing in this book is amateurish at best and even the main character feels wholly undeveloped. The world in which it's set adds nothing to story and feels slapped together haphazardly from ideas other authors have explored. As an avid reader of this and related genres let me just say that there are probably thousands of similar books, by both well-known and less well-known authors, that put this book to shame. This is my first review on Amazon as I've never felt the need to comment--either good or bad--until now. It was just so awful I had to write something."
1,Dross,"By chance, I read this book exclusively whilst on the toilet. In retrospect, i couldn't have picked a more appropriate place."
2,Slightly Below Average,"Not a terrible book but definitely not a good one. The story is somewhat lame and unispired. Some characters are given names denoting their personalities (The author attempts to explain this as a royal tradition, but I know a lack of imagination when I see it).Without any sarcasm i say: If you like bland, cookie cutter fantasy that's been hard at work trying to keep Tolkein's tradition alive (without advancing the genre in any way), this is a good pick for you."
3,"Good book, well written. Bad ending",This book is completely unlike any book I've ever read before. The story really sucks you up and you find yourself beleiving that you are part of the story. The only bad part was the way the series ended.
4,Nice Storyline,"Having read a lot of fantasy, I can honestly say this is a good book w/ a nice storyline. One of the things I enjoyed about the book is the level of power is limited to a few. Those few with power are still susceptible to the common cloak and dagger, diplomatic intricacies of a normal individual living in such an environment. I'm not sure how the rest of the series goes, but I found this book interesting. Not to mention, the price for the Kindle version made it an obvious choice for my most recent reading selection."
3,Pleasantly Surprised!,"I must admit that I read this book because it was a free download from Amazon and I wanted to test my new Kindle. The book started off slow and slowly pulled me in. The story never reached a ""break neck"" speed as my other reads normally do but it steadily drew me in just the same. I thought the characters were well developed and believable. Well done. I am looking forward to reading the rest of the books in this series."
1,All Hope For Redemption Is Lost,"This series is truely awful. I have never felt sick to my stomach as after reading this series. The main character goes through so much turmoil, pain and loss that its almost unbearable. The payoff for the pain (for the character and the reader): none. Leaves you feeling empty and disheartened at the end by the cruelty and unfairness of the world. A happy ending is one thing, an unhappy ending is another, the ending to this series is just downright depressing. Avoid. I was put onto this by George R R Martins recommendations, stick to Lynn Flewelling or just wait for teh next Martin book."
1,"Stopped soon after puppy companion ""killed""","Sorrow, Pain. Sorrow. Pain.After the boy's puppy companion is supposedly killed, I endured a bit more and then stopped.If I want never ending sorrow, I can read the news online or check for how much further in debt my nation is or...What is the point of unrelenting sorrow novels?"
1,downer,"I have read all of Robin Hobbs books ,while well crafted, NOTHING GOOD ever happens. I can get depressed all on my own. I don't expect Pollyanna's tales but these stories will make you want to get a script for Zoloft,and if you already have one ,up your dose ."
5,One of the Best,"The Farseer Saga is one of the best series I've read. Hobbs describes human relationships very well. And though I normally dislike books in which the main character is nice, the character of young Fritz is totally believable and you just can't put these books down.The world of FritzChivalry is described very well, interesting, realistic, and you'll continue to wish that there were more. And the interesting plot line and characters will capture your heart as they try to make a better world, or a worse world, according to their pesonalities. This book is one of the few that really made me think, ""This is the BEST."" There are a lot of good books, but there aren't a lot of good books with the volume of the Farseer Saga."
2,when bad things happen to good people,"Ms. Hobb creates an engaging protagonist, and treats him so terribly one is compelled to buy the next book in the series to seek relief from what happens in this one. Each book repeats the pattern. They're cliffhangers, of sorts, and that's the secret to the series's success. Also, there's a certain intellectual cache that comes with unhappy endings.My problem is that in this narrative, and in all the books in the series, a great deal of contrivance is marshalled to create its unhappy ending. Smart people, like the protagonist and his friends, must behave irrationally, and dumb people, like this novel's main villian, turn out to be inexplicable masterminds.I give the book 2 stars because the first two-thirds of it draws you in. Ultimately, however, it's unnecessarily depressing, a cynical exercise, I think, on the part of the author, and a masochistic one for the reader."
4,"Good, but . . .","she really has one glaring implausibility which is central to the storyline. This book is good, but as I read it the characters don't seem to ring totally true because of this implausibility. It defys belief that the characters in this book would react the way the do at times when their lives are threatened. This detracts from the overall story and it is a feature that one must become accustomed to, because it seems prevailant in the next book as well. Notwithstanding this the world is interesting and the rules are novel and fresh. It seems to follow the same mold as most fantasy books though, in that the characters are either all good or all evil. There are no shades of grey. This fallacy seems to come with the genre though (with the exception of George RR Martin), so it can be forgiven . All in all it is a satisfying book that is enjoyable to read.One note . . . the author loves the word ""rebuke."""
5,A wonderful series,"The Assasin series;Live Ship series and the Tawny Man series are all a joy to read. Sit back, enjoy and immerse yourself in a land that is full of subtleties and twists. There are no major battle scenes (thank goodness)just good story telling at its best. This first book is an excellent stage set and it just gets better and better. You can't stop until you have read all 9! and then there is a sense of loss as we have so enjoyed the unfolding of this compelling journey of 1 man and his wrestle with who he is and his place in the world, one fool who is enigmatic and yet engaging, and the value of truth - no matter how hard it looks to tell...."
2,A well written chronicle of an unworthy protagonist,"I started reading this series based on the glowing reviews that it received in this forum. I continued to read the whole series because Hobb has a rich writing style. I was extremely let down at the end of the series because the hero remains nothing more than a pawn and a victim to the end of his days. He never utilizes all the skills and gifts that he is given, and doesn't take one proactive step the whole story. Really Mr/Ms Hobb... in today's term, how could a character with so much game turn out to be such a punk?"
3,Good start,"I thought that it was a good start for the series,nd I plan to read the rest of it. Hobb's characters are very real and easy to relate to( not in the assassin way and killing people unless you are an assassin then you can relate even more).The book is uniqually written with many twist and turns, but I found it hard to follow the passage of time in some spots. Also it is sometimes hard to pick out the flashbacks and reality or when he is skilling or just talking so I gave this story 3 stars for origanality and for the story line."
4,Addictive,"Whoever wrote that this series was ""...impossible to put down, but emotionally draining."" hit it on the head. It is also the best possible argument for making books available for free; I have since bought the rest of this series, and am now going through the next."
5,awesome book,this book is a great book and opened me up to more of her books i have read everyone in this triolgy
2,My 2 cents,"Honestly I just wanted to put a 2 star review to lower its overall rating, I am a avid reader of fantasy and found this series to be pretty bad. The characters are to damn dumb and the book moved way to slow. I didnt hate it (I've read worse) but 2 stars is more than fair I believe and warn people off this series. I read the first, audiobooked the last 2 and there is no payoff it just goes slower and slower. Havent read Hobbs other books but I heard they are better>"
5,excellent book,"This is the first book i've read by this author. It is an excellent book with good action and one of the most thought provoking novels i've read in some time. i enjoyed it very much, a fast read."
5,outstanding book,"As the author's first book, it was really unbelievable surprise. Author shows deep understanding of human mind, and wraps all in the very realistic, yet imaginary surroundings. In this book you can find everything - adventure, mistery, wisdom... and it works perfectly! Simply, every fantasy fan must read it"
4,Very good first novel.,"I thought the plot line was very original, and I liked the way his system of magic worked. I have read the second book in the series and it too is very enjoyable. I look forward to the next book in the series"
2,Overrated,"I have read a lot of fantasy, I mean a LOT, from old Tolkien and Salvatore, to Jordan, Martin, Sanderson, Weis, Rothfuss, Lynch, Erikson, Abercrombie, Donalson, Lackey, Bucther etc. I found Hobb's books bland and boring. They sure haven't failed to put me to sleep at night. I just couldn't understand what people saw in them. It's like a constant wait for things to pick up and they never really do. Ordinary characters, ordinary plot, ordinary writing. Wasn't my cup of tea, to say the least."
5,very worthwhile,I read the first book and found that it contained that little extra that makes a fantasy book something you should read. In other words good entertainment. I find it not too good that some of the reviewers review the whole series. I mean I've read the first and don't want to know what happens in the third. Now I know the character will never be great. He doesn't have to for the book to be good but maybe it slackens the suspens.
3,Farseer Trilogy Review,"It agonizes me to continue reading this series because though it is good, the plot and style of writing suffocates the intended enthusiasm and joy that I should receive from this trilogy. Robin Hobb's effeminate style of writing does nothing for me and the way she stifles the main character (Fitz) is a constant drag the reader has to plow through. The villain is the typical carbon copy from other fantasy books and wields so much power without consequences that it's infuriating to take him seriously. The upper hand he always holds.And yet with all it's flaws, it's still a decent book that is worthy of being read. It completes itself, and a lot can be said of an author that doesn't drag her story out for profit. Just be warned that it's not a feel good series but a roller coaster of emotions that more often than not leaves the reader at the bottom of the emotional ride than at the top..."
3,An interesting opening to a forgetable trilogy,This book starts like most sword and sorcery books with a character that starts small but gains power and enemys as the books go. It started a long tradition of huge problems that just seem to fix them selves that last through the entire series. The story has some very interesting ideas which made me the reader incapable of stopping(I read the intire series in four days). The only problem that I saw with this book is that the author made jumps of understanding that as the reader i did not agree with. some of the things that happened in the also had this problem they made sence only because the author said they did.
2,Simply Average,"I must say that I am new to fantasy books. I started with Lord of the Rings and I guess I am spoiled. I loved Lord of the Rings and I just can't review fantasy books without some reference to it. I've also read works by C.S. Lewis that I thought were good. However, this book was not necessarily boring but I just couldn't get attached to the main character. I don't particularly understand the ""Skill"" or the ""Wit"" and I am not really interested in assassins. I can't decide if I wish to continue in this series. I have the other two books but I just can't seem to care what happens to the character. Perhaps I will come back to it someday but this particular story was not interesting to me."
2,Poor Fitz,"The characters and story compelled me to forge ahead with this novel but Fitz, the main character, was so abused in every aspect of his life, he should have just laid down and croaked. Poor guy seemed to have so many things going for him but he just couldn't get a break. When I finished the book I just thought ""huh""."
4,A Character-Based Quest that mixes Coming of Age with Psychological Drama!,"This review is about the whole trilogy:The Farseer trilogy follows the gritty fantasy of the George R R Martin and Glen Cook tradition. The first person point of view creates a sense of inner psychological story, although with many action scenes and enough plot to entertain. However, the focus of the novels is the character of Fitz Chivalry. The saga is part coming of age (first and second books) and part psychological/existential drama, with an fantasy action motifs merged within the story.World building is interesting, with a basic but very well explored magic system. Motifs of sacrifice, honor, duty, maturity, and existential questions abound, and the prose is well written. Sometimes, the story dwells too much in the inner conflicts of the main character, but overall, the final effect is a vivid picture of a well rounded and realistic protagonist."
5,"Reality or fantasy, but an initiatic path","Well, I've read a lot of fantasy series but this trilogy is special! Althought the author is a very good writer and the story is very interesting, what amazed me in this trilogy, is the fact that it describes an initiatic path. It is not just few esoteric connotations as it can happen in fantasy books all the times. The fact is that almost every aspect of an initiatic path is described or is hidden one way or another in the story. Maybe Robin's intuition has been connected to something higher when she has written this tale or maybe it was her intention to do so, anyway this story is more than fantasy! Well, if it is only for the magic of the tale, it is worth reading!"
4,Great tale!,This is a wonderful tale. I found myself reading until the wee hours because I couldn't put it down. If you like fantasy you will like this book. There is relitively little magic happenings in this book but it is still a good book. You won't find dragons or elves threatining the people. Fritz does learn to comunicate with animals. This is a good book to help you escape reality.
5,Simply Amazing,"Song of Ice and Fire, Dark Company, Lord of the Rings, rank among the best of all the fantasy trilogies I have read in the past 20 of my 29 years. Robin Hobb's Assassin Trilogy tops them - but this is not the best thing.Vibrant, subtle, illuminating, fascinating stories are woven throughout these books. Eventually, I came to see Buckeep through Fitz's eyes - first time for me. Just amazing. Amazing.The descriptions on the cover and here on Amazon.com fail to express the experience of reading these books. The essentials are in the descriptions, but not the experience...which in this case...is everything.Of them all, this is the one to read...and read..Simply excellent."
4,Surprisingly good,"My (adult) son bought this book and that's how I ended up reading it. Which is not to say I don't read a lot of fantasy but the title of this one probably would have put me off otherwise. The title sounds juvenile but the book is not. The story develops slowly so there's no great-big grab-ya moment, you just get sucked in. The main character is easy to empathize with. He's not perfect but he does the best he can given the circumstances. And the plot is full of surprises that--and this is the really good part--are actually surprising and make sense within the confines of the world and the story.This is not a book that is going to change your life, but it is a book you will enjoy reading and will think about for a long time to come."
5,One of the best fantasy series,"I've read all of Hobb's books, repeatedly. Love them......wasn't too crazy about Solder's Son books, but I'm holding no grudge.You can't go wrong with Assassin's Apprentice and all of the following books....read them."
3,A good story that travels slowly,"Overall the story is a good one but I had a hard time not getting bored especially in the first half of the book. I found the amount of description, while brings the characters and world to life, makes the story more drawn out than it should have been. The end did not seem like an end at all and almost felt like the book stopped in mid sentence. While I would buy the other two books of the series, I probably won't bother with it for a long long time."
3,Just didn't grab me,"I found this book compelling at first, but just didn't hold my excitement throughout. Little bit too much of the typical underdog discovers hidden powers and saves the world story."
4,great characters & relationships,good storytellingnot overly original storyoverall well worth reading
4,"Slightly formulaic, however...","Hobb makes the formulas work well - and as always, her talent for characterization is truly awesome. But wow... this Fitz dude sure is one unlucky sucker, and this is perhaps the area where a reader strains hardest to suspend disbelief, regardless of the book being a fantasy novel! Ha!"
3,Does Robin Hobb hate dogs?,"I like the book so far (I am like two thirds through) and am looking forward to reading the second in the trilogy, but I am quite upset because dogs keep getting viciously killed in this story. I understand that those are metaphors (things being taken away from the hero of the story), but does the author really have to do it more than once? Couldn't it have been something else? Do you have to make people fall in love with a precious puppy and then kill it? Twice?"
4,Three cheers for a depressing fantasy trilogy!,"I read this while I was in bed with meningitis and a bad case of self-pity, and it really cheered me up (in a depressing kind of way!) Fitz is a character who is some way removed from the kind of tediously upbeat born-with-a-sword-in-his-hand type of hero you too often find. He suffers from a good deal of self-doubt, and his accident of birth seems like a curse that he cannot cast off, making for a gently melancholic mood. Some of the other characters are intriguing too, especially the Fool (who is developed more in the last volume of the trilogy). Almost the best fantasy novel I've read recently (the best was CJ Cherryh's Fortress in the Eye of Time, which also has a rather tormented hero)."
1,Not what I had hoped for; writing style jarred me,"OVERALL FEELING: Too slow; I read the first 40 pages and then skimmed ahead to be sure I wasn't missing something . . . it was in first person but not enough interesting things happened . . . sometimes the narrator glossed over things that could have been interesting. Too detached; too vicarious; not enough conflict; not enough surprises or interest.If you think I'm being too unfair and have some good reasons for giving her another chance, email me."
1,Utter dreariness,"After reading all the rave reviews, I am left completely confused. This book is not good. If ever a book could be judged objectively, this is it. In this book nothing happens. Bad things happen to the protagonist and he whines about it. Then, other characters react in completely unbelievable ways. The prime example being Burrich abandoning Fitz for using the ""Wit"", without so much as an explanation as to why the ""Wit"" is a bad thing. Basically 400+ pages of depression with no pay off.The readers who actually liked this book must have been ""Forged.""SOME ONE PLEASE EXPLAIN WHY YOU CAN LIKE A BOOK IN WHICH NOTHING HAPPENS SAVE MEANINGLESS DEPRESSION??!!!??Go die Fitz Chivalry."
4,A fun book to read,The other reviews capture the essence of this book. I too truly enjoyed it and look forward to reading the entire series. Very creative.
5,Responding to Dichotomy between cover art and content,"It has to be said that the cover art from England was much better than that from America (truly gothic, involving detailed pictures and insets of choice scenery and characters. Having read the first two, though, I couldn't wait for the third to be published in England and therefore begged a copy from Amazon.com. Therefore I have no right to complain - and the content of book 3 (Assasin's Quest) is absolutely and completely as gripping a read as books one and two. So well done (but keep an eye out for the British Publication!)"
4,A rarity,This is one's good. One of the very few fantasy books that grabs you right from the start and actually concludes with a climax. Doesn't crap on and on. If you hate Jordan you'll love Assassin's Apprentice.
2,More emotional novel than actual fantasy,"** Minor plot spoilers **Hobb writes like a girl. I don't mind feeling the gender of the writer or having writers be who they are, I just think that reviews should express this style. By writing like a girl, I mean that everything is from the emotional viewpoint, she even kills the boys dog over and over making it as emotional as she can and explaining that dogs hurts even more. The premise has a lot of promise but it is very slow to develop and there is very little excitement beyond physical abuse and emotional pain. I hear of the 2nd book in the series that the now obviously evil people don't get called out, while the innocent and main charactors suffer endlessly. I won't be buying #2."
1,The most boring book of all time.,"This very well could be a magical, enchanting trilogy however the author has made the terrible mistake of making it so BORING in the beginning. I am on page 220 and NOTHING HAS HAPPEND. I repeat NOTHING HAS HAPPEND. This book is terrible, the names alone are laughable (Patience, Regal, Chivalry, Fitz etc..).Why would any author want to NOT grap the attention of its reader, this is a huge mistake this author has made. This is the first time I have ever actually put down a book with no interest whatsoever of finishing it. Terrible."
1,Dear Heaven,"If you like depression, stories where nothing ever goes right for our main character and he is never happy (unless it's so that happiness can be tragically yanked away from him), by all means, read this book. It is so unrelentingly, unrealistically depressing that I listed to a friend everything that happened to our main character, and she couldn't believe I finished reading it. Angst is substituted for depth and dreariness is substituted for reality (even in the real world, things DO occasionally go right, if only by accident). Take my warning -- stay away!"
2,"ponderous, should be a childern book.",not many people use the first person narrative well (such as ursular le guine) and unfortunately robin hobb is not one of them. it is hard to find good fantasy to read. yep this book is alright and no doubt will be popular but it lack finess!
2,More a childrens tale,I was looking for something more suited for an adult. Something along the lines of the RA Salvatore or Jordan's Wheel of time. I only made it half through the book before I looked for somethng else.
3,Will probably not stay on my iphone...,"I downloaded the book during its freebie period and it kept me entertained enough to read and finish it (I am normally not a big fantasy reader). Thinking about it after a few weeks, it reminds me a lot of a well-done computer game. Though I have to admit that the characters have some dimension.I'm probably not going to buy the 2nd book though and will probably delete this book from my phone if I need space..."
3,Just like real life.,"When I started reading this book, and three fourths of the way through it, I just wanted to know what was coming next. Then I realized that not much was going to happen. No overall hero. No exciting fights. Never a lot of excitement. The book at the end reminded me of life, the majority of it slow with very few moments of complete exhilaration. The problem off course is that I read for entertaintment and excitement, not to be reminded of reality."
5,enjoyable read,"This is by no means high literature, but was a great read. I fly alot and found this book very engaging and hard to put down. I want to purchase the rest of the series now."
3,"ok for free, but too full of itself","The story itself was ok - many of the characters well-fleshed out, a fairly good premise, etc. I found the narrative voice distracting - the ""look back in wisdom describes the naive past"" too much foreshadowing, I guess. I managed to finish it, but am not inspired to get the rest of the series. Had I actually paid for it, I'd be a little peeved at myself."
4,Great Book,"This book was a very intersting book with tons of plot twists. This book was full ""political"" assassinations and decite from characters you never would have thought possiable. This book also shows the maturing of a king-in-waiting's bastard"
3,Mildly entertaining,"This book was modestly entertaining, albeit a bit stupid...the thing that annoyed me was that it didn't really let you know it was a fairy-tale of sorts until further into the book, by which time I was far enough I didn't want to abandon. Not terrible, but also not the greatest thing every published, that's for sure. Make believe story with supernatural abilities of main characters -- a bit over the top versus what I expected."
4,Gotta read this!!,"Engrossing, hard to put down, that's what Assassin's Apprentice is. Picked it up on Friday and finished it Sunday night. didn't get much done but what a 'vacation' I had (so to speak) I was so entranced by the plot and the interaction of the characters, I think that's what sold me the most. I'd also suggest The Unsuspecting Mage by Brian S. Pratt, though it's not nearly the caliber of this one.Like I said, you've 'gotta read this!!"""
5,A must for book lovers!,"I have read this series over and over. More times than I can count, and not once has it lost its ability to pull me into the story. So much so that I find myself feeling and relating to the characters. You are drawn into the depths of Fitz's life. His joys and sorrows, triumphs and losses. Robin Hobb is truly a master of her art. I doubt I will ever tire of this world of hers. I still end up feeling lonely when I finish the series. Like I've lost a good friend. If you want a really good book that entertains and makes you think, this is it. Bravo Robin!!"
5,Absolutely Incredible,"My title really says it all. I was completely engrossed in this series fromt he first page. Characters are rich and detailed and Hobb is wonderful at creating intense drama and suspense throughout the trilogy that kept me on the edge of my seat. Thouroughly engrossing, detailed, lively and above all very human. Hobb now stands out on my list of favorite writers."
5,Pry the book out of my hand IF I fall asleep,"Not since George R. R. Martin's Song of Ice and Fire series have I been up all night reading a book. My husband had to pry Assasin's Apprentice from my fingers after I had fallen asleep one night. Just when I think I know what is going to happen next, I'm surprised. I found myself laughing out loud and then in shock when I found out that what was happening wasn't necessarily a joke. I was definitely kept on my toes in the first book, and am finding the second in the trilogy just as exciting. Robin Hobb has just become one of my favorite fantasy authors and I am looking forward to reading more from her."
4,A Nice Accident,"This is not the normal book that I would pick for myself to read, but I needed a 4th book for the promotion that was running at the time (buy 4 for the price of 3), so I bought this book thinking I would give it to my teenage son. As I was waiting one day, I had the book still in the back seat of my car, so decided to pick up this book to read to bide my time. I was pleasantly surprised that I really did like the book and have now ordered the other 2 books in the triology to read for myself - sorry son. Even if you are not a fantasy book lover or even if you are, I think you would enjoy this book. I am into herbs and stuff, so that part of the book was especially interesting. I may become a fantasy book reader after all."
4,Say Cheese,The pictures are highly expressive. The story is mostly original. Readers will be encouraged to think in their own time of need. The areas of cooperation and methods are well thought out. It is more than just sweetness and good intentions. Recommended both as enjoyable as well as thought provoking.
5,The best Baby CD in the world!,Love Talk & Lullabies is simply the best lullaby type that I have ever bought. The singing is beautiful and the instrumental portion is very relaxing. It's my favorite CD!
5,Wonderfully Soothing from the the Heart!,I loved this lullabuy CD. It doesn't just have soothing sounds and music to lull your little one to sleep but adds Cynthia Goodman's soothing and and reasuring voice. Her words are what you would wish for your child to recieve from your own heart. Listening to her words combined with the music puts you in the same wonderful contentment as your child. I never grow tired listening to it!
4,Good product,"It is well-made product with a good price. It is somewhat heavy to use, but overall quality seems very satisfying."
4,Had a lot of good information.,"It was smaller and had fewer pages than I had hoped, but it was well written and had good information in it. I read through it when I received it (before giving it to my grandson) and I learned things about rainbows that I didn't know! I bought it with the ""Be Amazing"" kit on colors."
4,all the colors of the rainbow,"This book was purchased for my four year old daughter's fourth birthday to go with the Over the Rainbow book and CD. She is a very precocious four year old and wanted a unicorns and rainbow birthday. She loves to learn all the science behind stories and this book fits the bill. It is a very small paperback (to be expected for the price), but is enough on her level to understand its concepts. Should last her many years in the future. The company mailed it in a timely fashion and the shipping cost more than the book, but its worth it for her enjoyment."
5,A great lotion,"I had recently emptied my bottle ofJason Body Care: Hand and Body Lotion, Aloe Vera 8 ozafter having it for almost two years (I only use lotion in the winter months) and I needed another good lotion. I was never a fan of lotion as just about all of them I had tried since childhood felt horribly greasy on my skin. I get cold easily in winter and I've found that proper moisturizing helps to keep me warm. I was very happy with my Jason lotion but finding it here in Korea where I currently live and work is impossible. I saw a bottle of Avalon Organics Peppermint lotion at a local big box store and decided to give it a try. The feel of it was a lot different from Jason's brand, but it certainly wasn't bad. It was not greasy at all which was a definite plus and it absorbed quickly into my skin. I also enjoy the scent and feel of peppermint oil as well. I would highly recommend this lotion to anyone looking for a good natural moisturizer that feels and works great on your skin."
4,Lots of helpful information,A great book to browse off-season. Lots of good tips on almost every aspect of skiing. I found the chapters on actual skis to be this least informative. And I would strongly suggest wearing a helmet at all times. But overall I picked of dozens of good pointers.
2,Probably not what you are hoping for...,"I'll make this short - I rented this because I love ""found footage"" horror movies. This one operates on that premise, and the trailer looked pretty good. The first half of the movie delivers a promising setup - the last half is a complete and utter disappointment. By the end, I guarantee you'll be asking yourself, ""is that all there is?!?"" It's like the filmmaking team simply quit at the halfway point and just figured they could throw in any predictable, boring ending. And that's what they did. I suggest to my friends that they not waste their money on this film, despite the packaging and the trailer.SPOILER ALERT: Al least half the movie is spent wandering aimlessly and (with one very very brief exception) through a disused outdoor plant ""labyrinth"" utterly without any kind of surprise or ""horror"" or, really, anything interesting. You WILL fastforward several times during these tedious scenes."
3,Too bad...,Let me start by saying I love the series. I was so excited to find this series at such a budget price. It started off amazing; I bought the first season and fell in love so I bought the 2nd and 3rd set of the S.A.V.E. series and was sorely disappointed. The box is a bit misleading by stating the 3rd and 4th seasons would be 16:9. Yes they are in widescreen but there were not enhanced for widescreen tvs. So what I got was this tiny little widescreen show in the middle of my widesreen TV!!! I am pissed! Such a shoddy presentation from funimation!If you are willing to overlook the deception buy the set...if not...look somewhere else.
3,Great for the price.,"So far this has been a great television. I would highly recommend this for anyone who doesn't have or doesn't want to spend the money on an expensive 1080p t.v. I can't tell the difference between the two.So far I have been VERY satisfied with my purchase, I highly recommend the TV for anyone shopping for a plasma in the $2000 price range. Only negative thing I could say right now, is the anti-reflective coating on the screen could be much better. I suppose it does reduce some reflections, but I've still seen some glare. Otherwise a really fabulous set with great features and incredible picture quality."
3,"Nice PIcture, But Issues with Sound","The picture quality on this TV is excellent, but I would like to highlight two issues with the sound:1. I have experienced, and others as well have reported, intermittent drops in sound using HDMI. It will cut in and out and possibly totally out.2. Dolby Digital is not supported over HDMI. You can work around this with more complex cabling, but it would seem to be if you are going to put 3 HDMI inputs on the TV it should support the most common digital sound format. You can run component cables and digital audio inputs from all of your input sources, but really, what a pain. HDMI is designed to simplify and consolidate this."
5,Excellent TV,Great picture quality (SD and HD)..and excellent set of picture controls. really good finish and look and feel.great service from amazon..got it in 5 days
1,"HP Televisions are horrible and HP doesnt honor their products when they break, which they will","I purchased a 58inch HP Pavilion HD TV roughly 2 years ago. The computer went out in the TV. HP replaced the TV as they could not fix the problem. The technician, (whom was wearing an HP shirt and name badge), that installed the new TV said that with the new TV my warranty resets. He told me this because I expressly asked ""what happens if the new TV ends up having the same problem?"" Less than 9 months later the new TV also broke with the same computer problem. I contacted HP technical department and I was told that the warranty explained to me by the HP technician was incorrect. They went as far as to try and say that the technician was from a 3rd party and didn't work for HP. I asked for the 3rd parties name and was told that HP wasn't required to give me that information. I implore anyone that is considering buying a TV from HP to consider Sony or any other product TV besides HP."
1,tv lasted 1 week then quit,I bought the samsung from amazon on january 2 and got it turned on and delivered to my house on the 10. the tv worked great for the first 7 days then 1 night i go and try to turn it on and poof it makes loud noise then nothing dead. im very disapointed with this samsung im just glad i bought it from amazon they have allready shipped me out new 1. i just hope this 1 last a bit longer.
1,Burn in,Don't believe the hype about burn in not being a problem anymore.This set is only a month old and has CNBC burned into the set.
1,Hugh Disappointment,"I would not recommend this item to anyone! What a mistake. The HD looks fine and crisp, but if you're watching a regular channel, the picture looks terrible! You can see these wiered boxes that make up the picture, and if the picture is too white, the tv makes a static noise. I'm checking into returning it - I'd rather have my old 36"" back!"
1,Garbage,"I purchased this TV last June from Sears (first mistake). NCAA playoffs on right now and my picture went out. Called Sears for repair, naturally they are ""busy"", but said they have had problems with this TV's picture board burning out (whatever that means). It was fine when it worked, but I sure wish I would have bought something different now.Sears/Samsung.....a deadly combination. Steer clear for peace of mind."
5,Highly recommended,"I shopped endlessly for an HDTV at all of the retail stores, and I was pretty much set on Samsung for quality and price. I finally decided on the 50 inch 5064 and I am so glad I did. It looks beautiful, just mesmerizing. My signal is from Verizon FIOS for the HD with an HD-DVR through HDMI connections.The order was filled within one week and the delivery company called me to arrange a time the next day. They arrived on time, unboxed the unit, moved my old 36 inch CRT (240 pounds) and set up the new plasma TV, all in about 10 minutes. The crew was very friendly and professional. All in all I saved money and had a very pleasant purchase experience.The only problem is that I can't stop watching it! It's great!"
2,Quit after 3 months - Poor warranty service,"I bought a Samsung HPT5064 in mid August because i thought the picture was fantastic.Mid November it quit. I'm still waiting on the repair. Samsung customer service keeps saying they first try to repair. Have been on the phone with them several times.I think they should have replaced a unit that was only a few months old.Based on the warranty service alone, I'd recommend going with a brand other than Samsung.12-14-07: They attempted to return my TV and struck it hard enough on the truck to break the front glass. Took TV back to repair shop. Samsung keeps referring me back to the repair shop (which refuses to replace it).-Mitch Deason"
5,from the back cover,"Scourge of the EclipticHe was driven by violent injustice from his home moon of Callisto and set forth to claim the epic destiny that would blaze across worlds and time. He saw his family destroyed, his sister carried off into sexual slavery, his beautiful lover killed - and he swore revenge against the murderous pirates who held the Jupiter planetodis in a stranglehold of terror...Fired by raw courage, steeled by young might, he rose in the Navy of Jupiter to command a personal squadron loyal to the death. And it was death they faced-against piratical warlords of the Jupiter Ecliptic who laughed at the young commander's challenge...until they met the merciless fury of the warrior who would annihilate all obstacles in his path to immortal renown as the Tyrant of Jupiter!"
4,Masters of Evil triumphant!,"First of all, this trade-paperback is out of print, so do yourself a favor and pick up the hardcover. In the past Baron Zemo had tried to defeat the Avengers by forming the Masters of Evil, and they always kicked his butt. Not this time! Zemo forms a new crew of evil (one that outnumbers our heroes), and actually gets the drop on Cap and company. First, they break into Avengers mansion and beat up on poor, old Jarvis! Then, it's just a matter of laying in wait for the Avengers to return home! Needless to say, Earth's mightiest heroes get their asses handed to them. One even gets sent to the hospital to die! Can the Avengers rally back to retake their home and get some payback? (C'mon, what do you think?)"
4,A Modern Comic Favorite,"NOTE: this has Nothing to do with the classic British TV series. It's a reprint of a late '80s storyline from a long-running Marvel team/comic. Here we find the heroes caught almost totally off-guard as numerous, orgainized villains prove it takes more than intelligence and determination to win, although our heroes aren't exactly shy of those. Well paced & thought-out (with story notes in & around the introduction), and only slightly hindered by a lack a familarity with the players and an unintentionally funny remark about the un-likelyhood of Spielberg winning an Oscar. (The 5th chapter, beginning of the hospital fight, in case you're looking.)"
5,Watching them sing is even better!,"I have listened to these songs so many times I have them memorized, but I had never seen Pandora perform until I got this DVD. Amazing! Fantastic! Seeing them as young (and a little chubby) beginning singers and then watching them progress to beautiful, talented (and definitely NOT chubby!) adult women was wonderful. I watched it straight through as soon as I got it and then I watched it straight through again. So many modern female singers don't know how to use their voices, but not these three!"
5,MicroSync Digital Transmitter used with Norman and Novatron,"It works great. It is smaller and lighter than other manufacturers versions. It is also less expensive than the Pocket Wizards that I see many photographers using. I have used it on my Canon cameras with Norman (2000 and 800) and Novatron (440) power packs and have had no problems. It is great not tripping over wires anymore. My tripping over a ""sync"" cord and breaking a camera is what made me invest in this item."
5,A great read if you want to help your adolescent son grow.,"I purchased the book for my adolescent son to read. My hope was that he might find some helpful hints on how to deal with his everyday life situations. What I found was an opportunity to communicate with him in a way that had here-to-fore been impossible. We began to really talk to each other about life and death, about different situations he would face in the world, in this country, in the neighborhood and in the home. We talked about how his responses to them would determine the kind of man he would become, the kind of life he would live. The book poses many real life situations that young Black men are faced with. It shows them the right answer to them, the right way to go. The authors must have drawn from many of their own experiences - the examples are on the money! I would strongly urge any parent, White or Black, who has an adolescent male in the house to buy this book and read it together."
4,My Students Responded to this Book,I teach in a public high school serving students who haven't been successful in the larger schools of our district. I had occasion to purchase this book when I got a class with a plurality of young African American males. They agreed that the father is the key component missing from their own and their peers' lives. This book offers sound advice in an easy to read and straightforward manner. One of my students who read it probably hasn't read a book in years. He took this one home with him on weekends.
2,Help for young writers,"This book is not what I really thought it would be. It has good introductions to different writer's craft and some practice but not lessons. It's a good book to use to set up a writer's notebook, but not to teach from."
1,Not useful,"I was looking forward to this book based on the reviews. But, this book was a big disappointment. The book promises reproducible mini lessons, but there is nothing that can be used effectively with children. I would recommend checking this book out at book store before you waste your money on shipping costs.Razzle Dazzle Writing: Achieving Excellence Through 50 Target Skills"
5,good job breaking down the steps of writing,Great ideas for beginning writers in terms of organization. Breaks down the steps simply. Explains what makes interesting writing.
3,A little disappointed.,"I was happy at first, but after two washes one pair came unstitched in the back and left a huge hole. Now I am wondering how long the other 9 pair will last. This is 1 in 10 pair so far that are no good, so I guess I am running at 90% which I guess is better than 50%. Hopefully the others will hold up. Not much more to say other than that I am disappointed in Hanes this time around."
2,Not the same as what I bought in the store.,"I do not recommend these.I fell for this twice, as I made the purchase more than once. These were not the same as what I bought in the store. I'm not really sure why. I honestly can't blame Amazon/the vendors, so perhaps a repeat of defects or inconsistency?Basically these ran quite a bit smaller than what I had expected for the size measurement. Too tight; not good.I recommend going with American Apparel underwear. They might be bright and make me feel like a kindergartner, but at least they fit consistently and are made in the USA!"
4,Good Underwear...,"I bought this Hanes Men Fashion Brief. My weight size is 40. This brief is very comfortable and well made. It is easy on the hip and inner thighs. It does not give any rash or whatever. It's very smooth, good elastic, and good quality."
1,Very dissatisfied,"This stereo has been a disappointment in the 3 weeks I have owned it. It seems to have been manufactured sloppily. The face plate does not fit on tight, so sometimes when I go over bumps the unit powers off. Even simple tasks such as setting the clock have way too many unnecessary steps. I thought the handbook was complicated to use as well. I plan on returning the unit."
2,Fair at best.,"I am a big Audie Murphy fan. and this book does not do him justice. It is filled with the same photos over and over, much of it is space filler. Each film is reviewed here, but there is little info on them. Just little blips or short interviews with people who worked on them. The whole thing reads like a cheap magazine. But what i really dont like is the lack of REAL photos, and the repeat of the same posters and lobby cards, over and over. I got this book for cheap from a clearing house placeso I am happy i paid VERY little for it. If you can get it for say $2, ok."
3,A Familar Echo,This is not one of Danilelle Steel best. Historical information was interesting and the trials and tribulations the Beata had to endure made the story endurable. The plot had a lot of holes and a lot of unexplained questions.
4,Echoes by Danielle Steel,"As a DS fan I know some of her books tend to have similar plots, but not this one. I really liked this one even though what happened was sad. I only wish there was more about Daphne and Beata though. Amadea's story was told, but not theirs. Overall, this is one of her good ones!"
2,Not very believable,"There are too many unbelievable incidents in this story... a Jewish girl defying her family early this century? Amadea not being tatooed in the concentration camp? (They ""forgot""?) The German soldier was killed instantly when Amadea pushed him into a rock? A nun of her conviction having sex with a resistance fighter in the first place, and secondly, not feeling remorse? A nun of her conviction not returning to the convent?The story had promise... history repeating itself, and a celebration of the internal strength of women. But I felt sad and cheated in the end. The fate of Beata and Daphne should not have been left hanging. Amadea assumed they died, and they probably did. But... we didn't know in the end, nor was any mention made of Amadea trying to find out. Its a story full of holes and so much of it is not believable."
2,This wasn't Danielle Steels Best,"I thought this book would be alot better. I know Beata and her daughter were taken by the Nazi's, but it would be nice to see her found by Amadea or someone else some how. After all, she was paralyzed and then began to walk again, so miracles do happen. Also, about her killing the man by tripping him, a little ridiculous, I agree.This was definitely not the best Danielle Steel novel that I read. I hoping that ImPossible that comes out in March 2005 will be much better."
1,Avoid this Book,"I have never written a book review before, but this book compelled me to do so. There was a time when all I needed to hear was that Danielle Steel had a new book coming out and I would buy it without knowing what it was about. Not anymore. I have been very disappointed in her last several books, but this one has to be the worst. It is so boring and repetitive. There are huge holes in the storyline. I couldn't wait until I had finished and could move on to something else. My opinion is Danielle Steel is past her best story writing and I will think twice before purchasing another of her books. For a good romance novel, read Nora Roberts. She never disappoints."
3,"Wow, just wow","Wow, just wow. That's all there is to say! This book was somewhat eventful, but it was very predictable! All the ""twists"" were seen straight away. It was predictable, sappy, and not for anyone looking for a good, deep read."
2,so much potential...,"This book looked like it had it all for me: historical setting + romance I have to give it 2 stars because it had these 2 elements, unfortunately it seemed like I was reading a well written outline. It really could have been turned into so much more. The story felt like - he was handsome + she was pretty = they fell in love. No details, no drama, just some facts you were supposed to believe. I could have written a better book had I been given this material. Glad I didn't buy it. Is Danielle still writing at her best or just making money writing crap that will sell??? (I may not be the best judge because this is her first book I have read)"
3,Not quite enough...,"I am an avid Danielle Steel reader. Though I am not a critic and I am usually easy to entertain. I do not expect a lot from any book I read, just a nice diversion. This book delivered that as, have all my prior readings from Danielle Steel. My only complaint was the ending. After all the characters went through, I felt as we were left hanging with no real closure. Yes, something nice happened, but we only get the ""They lived happily ever after..."" scenario and no real answers as to how everything panned out afterward. But again, I am not a real critic; I enjoyed the book right up until I realized that it was over without answering all my questions. Thanks."
4,Echoes - refreshing change,"What a refreshing change from her other books. I have been a collector of Danielle Steel's books for as long as I can remember, and have always purchased and read each book as soon as it was released. While I have enjoyed all of her stories, this particular story was very compelling, as was ""A Message from Nam"".I urge all of you to give this one a try. Maybe it will turn you on to becoming a collector of her other books."
2,not that great,"I just read this book and was dissapointed that the book never reveals what happened to the Amadea's mother and younger sister. I'm a Danielle Steel fan, but it's a letdown from her past work."
3,A little better effort . . .,"A little meatier story than ""Second Chances"", so I was somewhat distracted from editing/construction/grammar problems. But it really was just better edited, too (somewhat - still lacking). It was not so repetitive as many of her later stories, however, it is still too rambling in places, with the chronology jumping around in an unintentional manner. I still despise her over-long chapters.*****SPOILER****: She might have at least addressed Beata and Daphne's fate again before the end of the book, at least saying that Amadea never heard anything of them again, if that was the case!"
4,One of her best.,"I initially listened to this book and then went out and boughtit to have in my library. Quite honestly, I am not the biggest Danielle Steele's fan, but every now and then she writes a bookthat gets past her standard brief romantic fiction novel. This was one of those books. I also, however, gave her a four instead of a five due to the failure to address the issue of what happens to her mother and sister. The idea, I suppose, was to assume that they perished. However, it is possible that one or both survived. It would have been more interesting, however, to hint, at the end, that the sister had survived. This, in turn, would lead to a sequel. What a sequel, it might also be, if shefinds her sister, but the sister immigrates to Israel and becomes involved in Israel's beginning in the late 40's. But it is a wonderful book, buy it."
1,Total Tripe!,"Put your wallet away! This book was amazing...ly bad. The story itself had possibilities (had it followed a more believable vein), however, it was poorly written in the extreme. My high school English teacher would have run out of red ink, had she graded this novel. (Shame on Random House! Did an editor ever even glance at this before it went to print?) My main complaint is the complete lack of basic language skills, demonstrated in print, and inflicted on the unwary public. This was my first, and last, Danielle Steel novel."
3,Mediocre,"This was a mediocre story. With each new book she writes, I am torn.Someare decent reads, but others fall short. Echoes falls in between thetwo. Not nearly her best story, but not her worst either.The story itself was a good one, one that proved interesting. Thecharacters were ok, nothing special though. The most disappointingthingwas that using a back drop like WWII and what was happening to theJews,this story could have packed a bigger punch with much more emotion withmuch more memorable characters.I can't say whether I'd really recommend this book to anyone, it leftme abit unmoved. Very mediocre."
3,Dot's Review,"I enjoyed this book at the first, but was very disappointed that she did not tell what happened to her mother, Beata, and sister, Daphne. She just completely left them ""hanging."" This could have been a great book. Come on, Danielle, let's have a sequel."
2,Mediocre,This book could have been so much better than it was. I applaud the direction of the book but there are so many gaps and no real depth to the story. This book is a disappointment.
2,Repetitive to a Fault,"While I found the story to be good.....the actual writing was not good. I thought it was extremely horribly repetitive. We know she has blue eyes, we know she is beautiful, we know it is a waste that she is a nun because she is so beautiful. We know because we are told over and over and over.Also, if Amadea was such a devoted nun, so true to her calling, she sure found it easy enough to fall in love with not only one, but two men in this story.At one point Amadea gives a guy a little shove, he trips over a tree root and falls. Just like that he is dead. How convenient to the story...but terribly unrealistic.At the end you never find out what happens to Gerard Daubigny or if Amadea ever sees her Uncle again.This story leaves one wondering if Danielle Steel couldn't sell it 20 years ago and now anything with her name on it will sell. I felt like the editors didn't even bother going over it.Save your money."
4,NOT HER BEST BUT STILL A GOOD READ,This is one of the better books that Danielle Steel has written lately. I enjoyed most of the book but agree with others that it would have been nice to find out what happened to Beata and Daphne unless Danielle Steel is planning a sequel to tell us what did happen to them.
5,Two great bands,"Not sure why the makers of this CD chose these two bands to put together on the same CD, but I am glad for it.Canned Heat are an enjoyable band, and their best is on this CD.But Quicksilver Messenger Service (or simply Quicksilver as they were called later) are the real standouts on this CD. They are the exemplary San Francisco sound of the late 60s and early 70s. You cannot think ""hippie"" or ""Haight Ashbury"" without thinking about the Jefferson Airplane, It's a Beautiful Day, and Quicksilver.And the generation gap is reflected on the song ""What About Me.""I'm always getting bustedAnd I got to take a standI believe the revolutionIs mighty close at handHow about:I smoke marijuanaBut I can't get behind your warsAnd most of what I do believeIs against most of your lawsIf you love the love generation, you gotta love Quicksilver. And this CD gives you an added bonus of the best of Canned Heat. Definitely a five star CD."
4,Level 7 a great read,"I read this book in 1967 while living in Japan as a son of a Navy man. Of all the books I read as a kid, this is one of a small handful I have remembered through the decades. It is so nice to see Kindle picking up the classics of old. This book was written at the height of the cold war, when the USA and USSR were just moments from pushing the button. This book follows one soldier and his life underground during the time leading to war through its aftermath. It is a true classic and a must read."
5,A Provocative and Thoughtful Warning to Mankind,"I read this book as a teenager and found it a sobering story. The reader must keep a certain detachment, remembering that the author is in part using his imagination. Although it may seem less topical now than when it was first published in the late 1950's, the end of the Cold War and the breakup of the USSR have reduced but not eliminated the nuclear threat. Roshwald paints a stark portrait of what could happen, which I took for what it was: a though-provoking warning to mankind. A great read which I highly recommend -- just keep in mind that it's fiction."
3,Level 7,"An interesting book, but the ending left something to be wished for. In fact, the book became more and more interesting as I read and then just stopped. Also, the introduction about Martian exploration was pointless."
5,Level 7,"Published in 1959, Level 7 is presented as the diary of a military man who is permanently stationed thousands of feet underground in a self-sufficient bunker. His job is to sit in a roon awaiting the command to push a button to fire nuclear weapons at an enemy country. When the command arrives and the button is pushed, he is forced to deal with the consequences of a nuclear holocaust that wipes out life on earth as he knows it, and is left with nothing to do but await the fallout that must inevitably reach the bunker and slowly kill the few humans remaining on a dying planet.Level 7 is bleak and terrifying, but it's just far-fetched and cold-war enough that it doesn't depress you too much. Read it and reflect on the self-destructive nature mankind can show, and the priority revenge and victory can take at the expense of quality of life."
5,A musical journey to another time,"Remember the Macarena, and how quickly you tired of the whole thing? Then, take a listen to songs that have enchanted music lovers for over five centuries. This CD includes songs spanning the 12th to 16th centuries, sung in any one of eleven languages. It contains one of the best versions of ""Greensleeves"" I have yet to hear."
1,it's a shame,"I wish i could say that the product was good, but i can't placed in an order from tiffrose0712 and at the last minute she just cancel the order. after email getting me excited for my shippment if she post it again dont buy from her"
4,LQQKsss Good,"After searching for three weeks for a phone, I am settling on the Uniden's EXI8965 900MHz Cordless Phone with CID and Dual Keypad. You see, this is a leap of faith, being that this is my first online purchase. I have never owned a Uniden phone, but I have owned others who were big in name, but small in performance. What I think I will enjoy most is the dual keypad will allow me to have two phones in one location. Have you ever been in the bedroom, wanting to make a call, but discovered that you left the handset in your laundry room??? Also I like the fact that this phone does not look like a kid's toy. I can place it anywhere and it will fit right in with my decor. It may be a lot to ask, but with the keypad being on both handset and base, that they could have figured out a way to put the Caller ID on the base too. That way, I can decide if I want to go get the handset from the next room!!"
1,Needs an editor,"This guy has delusions of grandeur. An excerpt from the back cover - ""nothing is more endearing then (sic) the love of man's most loyal companion the dog."" He's much too big for his britches."
3,A pilot's comments,"Although this dictionary is big, there are a significant number of terms I was unable to find that are important to instrument/commercial pilots - visual descent point (VDP), for example.Seems to be more engineering/maintenance oriented because those types of terms are exhaustively covered."
3,Changes in this bible,"This current printing of the kjv large print has some differences as compared to earlier printings of the same bible.Current printing-* done by L.E.G.O, an Italian bible publishing company* has softer n more flexible French morocco leather* has only one ribbon marker* less opaque paper but still readablePrevious printing-* done in United Kingdom* has harder n stiffer French morocco leather* has two ribbon markers* more opaque paper"
2,KING JAMES VERSION LARGE PRINT TEXT BIBLE,I GOOFED WHEN I BOUGHT THIS. WISH I WOULD HAVE LOOKED FOR ONE WITH CHAPTERS INDENTED WHICH WOULD HAVE MADAE IT EASIER TO FIND AND WITH THE LORD'S WORDS IN RED PRINT.
4,Interesting but not entirely realistic,"This book was one of the more interesting BSC books. It showed how being spirited and peppy is not for everyone, and that people who don't want to wear their pajamas to school (or whatever) shouldn't have to. But it was unrealistic that the parents and community got so involved in Spirit Month."
1,MAGAZINE RACK,"Was VERRRY disappointed when I opened up my package from this order.... First of all it was not what I had ordered. I was given a USED, BEAT UP, SCRATCHED, product and it wasn't even the right color! The product I received was blue, and I had ordered a clear magazine rack...Would NOT RECOMMEND THIS SELLER TO ANYONE."
5,Reading Book Rack for a Treadmill,The Reading Rack/Book Holder/Magazine Holder is great! It fits nicely around the top of the electronic panel on the treadmill. I enjoy reading books & magazines while working out on the treadmill. The seller provided fast delivery. I would recommend seller and purchase from seller again.
4,Reading Rack/ Book holder,"For the price, this book holder does very well. I originally bought it to go on my cross trainer so I could read while exercising but I've recently put it to use holding my cookbook in the kitchen. I would recommend this item because it's simple to use and portable."
2,not as described,Description states clear plastic. It arrived and is blue plastic. I did not see any of the blue plastic items when I ordered it. Product completely defies the purpose because you have to lift the book out to read the last few sentences on every page.
4,Book Holder for recumbent bike,"I purchased this book holder for my Schwinn 220 recumbent bike. It works well but due to the narrow book ledge on my bike the holder was a little unstable. Not to worry, I attached a velcro strip to the ledge and the bottom of the holder. Works great!!"
3,"Great Performance, not so great quality recording","I think that the interpretation of Satie's work here is really good, but my complain is that the recording has a lot of noise in it, is not just the noise of a life performance (which I don't mind), but there is a clear white noise in the background that spoils the overall effect. Still, as I said the interpretation is just great, but the noise issue forces me to give a 3 start rating."
4,One of the best interpretations of Satie,"Ciccolini has always been my favorite performer of Satie's music. This CD has some of Satie's best compositions and Ciccolini does them all justice. Essential listening for piano lovers, even those unfamiliar with Satie's work. Highly recommended."
5,Incredible story!,This book is an incredible story of survival. I have seen the movie also. I would recommend both!
5,a great story and a brave man,"This book is about a real survival story in World War II. Although the author himself was not a professional writer, this cruel and dramatic history really doesn't need any kind of exaggeration or decoration. His writing style is plain yet true to the fact. I was so absored by his story that I finished the book within two days!"
4,Excellent Book,"I bought the book because I wanted to better understand the story after seeing the DVD; after reading it, I congratulate the screenwriters. Being raised by a musician, I have very tender feelings for the story of a musician in hiding. I did not see it in the theater; had I, I think I would have stood in applause when he completed his first performance before the German soldier. Very moving! Reading it after having seen it was not a let-down, since there is so much in there that couldn't be filmed. Great book, great film, great man."
4,Speechless,It's hard to know what to write about this book as it is a story of survival that leaves one speechless. Like many I read the book after seeing the movie twice. It is an amazing testament to man's will to survive.
3,A memorable account,"This is a gripping and very readable account from a holocaust survivor.It has some strong lingering impressions.Firstly, the objectivity and lack of bitterness with which the writer re-lives some horrifying and traumatic memories.Second, the sense of darkness, of desperation, of squalor within the ghetto, and the positivity and spirit with which the story is told.Third, the personal integrity of the writer. Essentially he survives by keeping hold of his own sense of morality.I can't say that I loved, or particularly liked, this book (hence the three stars), but it certainly held my attention."
3,I wanted to like this book more then I did,"I realy wanted to like this book, and for the first half of this book I loved it.The first half of ""The Pianist"" is an excellent insight into a rarley told and very sad chapter in modern History, that of life inside the Nazi occupied Wasaw gettho. Indeed this part of the book is a delight to read it is as educational as it is chilling. The discription of the brutality of the Nazi SS will move all but the hardest of hearts.The problem I had with this book is the second half, starting with his escape by simply walking away from a work detail, seemed so improbable that I had a tough time beliving that this book was purely a work of nonfiction. Some of it could be true after all many Jews beat the odds in Europe during WWII, but Mr Szpilman's story just seems to me to have been overly embelished."
2,To Be Honest...,"I do feel that this book is good, but the detail in this book is far to scarce for a subject so strong. Sometimes the lack of detail makes you skip over very imprortant parts of the story, and the writer just made all of the events feel like nothing happened, and he never tell you how he felt in that situation.A good book, but not quite there."
5,Heartwrenching,"Yes ,the movie was shocking and extremely well done. The book however allows the reader to hear Szpilman's voice and it is a voice well worth listening to. His simple descriptions of scenes of unspeakable horror and brutality are absolutely haunting. The film was an excellent adaptation of this book but there is no substitute for reading this man's experiences in his own words."
5,The smaller the ball the greater the writing,"For any fan of golf (and golf history) this book is a must read. Veron captures the glory of the game in a captivating manner. The history of Beau Steadman is a history of the game post- Bobby Jones. The manner in which Veron brings in the history of the game and its greatest legends (Sarazen, Hagen, Hogan, Palmer, etc.) was smoothly blended in with the underlying story. My precocious teenage son who asks me much about sports history found the book fascinating and now knows that golf was played prior to the emergence of Eldrick Woods."
5,ONE OF THE MOST ENJOYABLE READS...,"The Greatest Player is one of the most enjoyable reads I've had in the last year, and I am an avid reader of fiction. I read half the book the first night and told all my friends at work about it the next day, starting a wonderful discussionof what would happen next, and polished off the rest the next night. Written in first person, I loved the feel that this was a true story, and no doubt alot of this book must be. Somewhere a Beauregard Stedman lives or at least, lived. Readers will love the intrigue, mystery and wonderful pace the Mr. Veron (hard to believe, but a first time novelist) has in the book. No doubt, he will develop a following for his work. He is very talented, or I should say, on this book, his talent shines bright ! I think the book would make a superb movie."
4,ENTERTAINING,Very amusing book with a great plot and also with a beutiful finish.If you like golf history you should read it.I really liked it.
3,Tantalizingly close to being great,"This book looks at the career of a fictional golfer who plays and beats nearly every great golf professional of his day. He does it in secret, and with the support of Bobby Jones. The book is very, very close to being great. It is told through the frame of a present-day lawyer looking through Jones' law files and weaving together the threads of the story. Unfortunately, for me, not enough detail is given about the matches played. This was a perfect opportunity to capture the character (in defeat no less!) of every golfer from Hagen to Hogan. The story gives more energy to the lawyer's efforts to find the greatest player who never lived than the golf he played."
4,good introduction,"Scullard takes a rather unique approach to Roman history, stopping before the Gracchi and thus avoiding the increasingly confused history of the nation just as it is unarguable moving from city-state status. As always, Scullard's work is well researched but not the best presented for the undergraduate audience. A good text if the instructor is able and willing to explain things to students."
4,A handy pocket guide to the popular Ford tractors,"If one is interested in Ford farm tractors, Fordson to the Hundred series, this guide gives a brief thumbnail sketch of the history and development. A list of models, features and serial numbers make this a convenient resource when identifying early Ford tractors. Inclusion of many b/w photos and reproductions of Ford advertising materials make for an quick and interesting read."
3,Ford tractor data book,"For the money, I was disappointed. The pictures were not displayed well enough to show the paint and decal areas. I would have liked the author to describe the different shades of paint and the paint schemes so as I repair the body work, I would know the correct areas for the different colors of paint."
4,Decent Book,"Good to carry with you as it's smaller. (7.5"" x 4.5"")Info seems accurate to all I've read in other books & websites so nothing really new here.If it's on sale you're getting a decent deal but otherwise nothing you couldn't find online."
5,Excellent Street Guide to London,"Perfect for Map Lovers or just for Navigating your way around the many small streets, mews and byways of London. Easy to use and as complete a street guide as you will find."
4,Crossroad of Oriental and Protestant Views,"Although the title looks controversial, one comes to understand easily toward the end that the author continuously looks at the good sides of hierarchy and social order. I thought that trait extremely oriental and similar to some Japanese sociologists. For him creating social orders is one of the most valuable endowments human beings are born with. His discription and enourmous data of the present state of ""the Great Disruption"" is breathtaking and insightful. The only point which disappointed me was that, although he stresses the change of women's attitudes towards job, family, kids, etc. as the major shifting force which dismantled the community, he does not link the human impulse to go back to social order with the women's increasing role in society. He merely talks about how men and women should adjust to the post-nuclear family style, and I was lost how he evaluates women's role in society."
5,"Concise, pointed, factual relief from media polemicists.","In a world of propaganda and hype, Francis Fukuyama has crafted an elegant, brief synthesis of theory and practical reality which does more to explain what's going on than all the Right and Left pundits combined. Detached without being haughty, Fukuyama sticks with objective reality and calls trends by their real names, without rhetorical device or manipulative effort."
2,Tedium is not insight,"Prof. Fukuyama's ability to state the obvious is plainly demonstrated in this book. Little new light is shed on the topics Professor Fukuyama purports to cover. The evolution of societies cannot be revealed in simplistic diagrams of the kind appearing in the book especially when the amount of originality is very limited. Stylistic devices such as the use of the semicolon ad nausem add to the tediousness of this book, making it hard to read and sentences difficult to analyze."
3,"Very interesting, but a little lacking in coherence","The subject matter is really quite interesting and his thesis is convincing. The big problem I have with this book is in its structure. It starts out with a big section of statistics, then a big section of interpretation of the statistics, with ""the big picture"" never really materializing."
2,"Amazing voice, mediocre song choice.",I have thought for a long time that Marilyn McCoo has the most beautiful voice of any female vocalist I've heard -- this cd was a disappointment.
4,A Rough CD,This CD has somethings not worth listening to. If you do buy it be sure to listen to the Tree. It really has some great songs. I reccomend it.
3,"this is good for ""silent practices""","This item is definitely good when living in a house with others, and you can practice different rudiments on it, but there are no digital cymbals or a digital bass. The fell to the ""drums"" isn't the greatest either, but they do do the job. there are a bunch of different sound effects on this I'd never be able to pull off with the real drum set I have, which ameks me like it. So again, I think Yamaha for making this, it kept me from quitting the drums, and now my family and I get along together because there is no noise factor."
3,A series of short stories,"If you are in the mood for a series of slightly related, humorous short stories then this book is for you. There is not a single story line that ties all of the stories together. Overall a fun group of stories."
4,"Good, easy read","Loved this book. The main character, Bex, takes us on his jobs - not all of which work out exactly as planned. The humour may not be to everyone's taste but if you do like British humour you will love this."
4,Good overall game,"This game kept me busy for a while. This game is set apart from the others in it's new type of control system. There is a sensor in the game pak which lets you move around by tilting the game boy. You can then move around and bounce of balls, collect stars, and destroy enemies, creating a pinball like atmosphere. This game is fun for a while, but the only part of the game is the 8 levels and that my be easy to beat. After you beat each section of the game and collected all the red stars, you then have nothing to do. Otherwise, this game is very good, bring kirby back to GB."
4,a game for a rock that tilts and tumbles,"this game is so challenging but has good graphics i think. you will like how u have to tilt the game boy to control it.its a litle hard to control kirby becase he wont stay in 1 spot. u have to get the right grip, the right balance and the right finger movements. well thi reveiw is done. buy it on this website r go to a store if u dont want shipping and handling"
3,It's nice but...,"When I bought it I thought that it was going to be a cool game, but sometimes it's a little frustrating to play.It's not that easy to control. But if you don't have nothing else to play or you are tired of Pokemon (any color) you can play this one"
4,a cool game,"This game is very cool.The point of this game is to collect all the red stars.It is difficult to collect all of them in the first star because you have no idea where they are.The second star is also hard because you get less time,different things in stages,and the bosses are harder.The good thing is that the red stars are hiden in the same places.Some red stars are under the floor.I know that because I got all 64 red stars in my file.Some are easy to get and other are hard to get.You will love the mini-games.You're probably like the sound room too.When you are battling King Dedede you will have to go in the cannon and hit him on the back.You can keep hitting him until he sucks the star.In level 6-1 you can find the warp star and teleport to level 8-1."
2,Sub-Par Efforts Deserve B-Side Status,"I really wanted to like this collection, as I am a big OMD fan, albeit more their early stuff then the later. However, this collection of B-sides is just not that good. In fact, some of these songs are downright awful. I'm disappointed because I thought this was going to be something that it didn't even come close to being."
2,Door issues,"Unfortunately there are not many Braille watches. This watch is great, but for the money we are lucky if the top of the glass will shut afte 3 months. You open the case (top glass or door) and feel the time. If the door does not close then the time mechinism does not work. So the door usually malfunctions 1 month to 3 months into owning this watch. Which for over $100 watch, that is very poor performance. My first Seiko watch lasted 1 year, the second 8 months, but the last 3 or 4 years the product has been very poor quality and I am lucky if it last 3 months. Verry upsetting for the Blind community!"
1,Seiko doesn't stand behind their products,"My husband wore this watch for about 6 months when the case broke (it was still under their warranty). The watch cover fell off. I sent the watch back to Seiko for repair, and they told me the CASE was NOT covered under their warranty. The repair department wanted $190 to repair the case. The watch only cost $150. What kind of warranty is that?Don't buy this watch. It is a piece of junk, and the manufacturer won't stand behind their product. What a dissappointment. What a fraud."
5,This Book is well written!,"Why is the Church Still Here? by Evangelist Calvin Frazier is a timely, and thought provoking book. The author has researched his topic thoroughly. Every point that he makes is backed up with scripture. The book is well written, and direct.The author gets his points across in a clear and concise manner. Calvin Frazier presents an interpretation of the end times from a different, and interesting perspective. He will encourage you to examine your own beliefs, and when you have finished the book, you will open your Bible. Actually, you will more than likely open your Bible before you finish the book so you can read it along with the book. I think that will please the author, because he states: ""My intentions are for you not to just accept what I am saying, but to go to the scriptures to read the word of God, and not depend on man's interpretation.""Why is the Church Still Here? is a book well worth reading."
5,great book!!!,"Dawn is about to meet her pen pal who is also logan's cute cousin! She feels like she's not good enough so she gets herself a bizzare makeover and tries to be someone she's not. But at the end of the book, she starts being herself again and gets along fine with him. Mary Anne was being a bit superficial in the book and not acting like her sweet self at all, but it's still a good read."
2,Not as advertised,"Amazon shows this ~$90 book as bound and printed in Italy (go to ""Inside Cover"" and check copyright page IV). In reality, it is bound and printed in China. This has happened to me before. The previous book's binding broke when first opened. This one is not much better.Amazingly, when emailed, Amazon replied that nothing on their website showed where the book was printed and bound! Amazon doesn't know what's on a copyright page? Wow.So just be careful buying expensive reference books over the internet. In stores you can check."
1,Evidence Discarded and Manufactured,"This writer did not know (or did he?) that... the OSI knew as early as August 1978 from Moscow cables sent to the State Department in Washington as well as to the American Embassy in Tel Aviv that John Demjanjuk was not ""Ivan the Terrible,"" and not only did it withhold that evidence from the defense, but dumped some of it, including original documents, into its trash bins. Furthermore, the garbage contents revealed that the OSI did not just conceal exonerating evidence, but manufactured false affidavits in collusion with the Israeli prosecution.Yet, from reading the author's blog he REFUSES to apologize for this book!"
1,"Boy ,is his face red !","354 pages and it all turned out to be complete BS!After being convicted,it later became obvious that Demjanjuk was not ""Ivan The Terrible"",and he was released to return home to the US.It has to make you wonder about the fairness of the trial.Obviously all the ""witnesses"" were either lying or completely wrong.I guess Mr. Teicholz should have waited until the appeals were over before writing this book,then he wouldn't have so much egg on his face."
4,ethnoambient chants that connects and east and the west,"This album, a groundbreaking effort by The Spirit Level, effortlessly blends eastern and western musical styles in a positive and groove-oriented fashion. Forget about Deep Forest and Enigma, that's old news compared to the fresh and enlightening feel of tracks such as Moksha and Peyote Road! This album takes you on a journey through your soul - some tracks brings back childhood memories, while others inspire you to explore the future beyond. Listen to this album with headphones, and let the music take you inside your deepest self."
4,"a complex plot with deception, power struggles, and mystery","Awen is a combined historical and fictional account of the constant struggle of power between Powys, Wales and Mercia, England in late sixth century. I recommend reading other Welsh fiction first such as Sharon Kay Penman's series starting with ""Here Be Dragons"". Then you will be familiar with welsh names, places, georaphy, and history; otherwise you can become confused as many Welsh names are unfamiliar. I know that by reading her series first, this book went smoother as I could concentrate on the plot. There are power struggles between kingdoms as well as between ruling families, constant deception and intrigue-- never a dull moment as something you thought you were following-- suddenly changes. Friend or foe; who to trust? It is amazing how much war was fought based on misunderstanding and the propaganda of those trying to get to the top."
4,great starter book!,"If your just getting into coyote hunting, this book is a good one. every thing suggested, Ive tried with some succes. Some parts seem a little out dated but for the most part a great read and a good book to learn from.-Coyote Jack"
3,A good read for hunting coyotes out west,I live in New Jersey so this book was a decent general coyote calling/hunting book but if you live in the eastern US like me I highly recommend Eastern Coyote Challenge by Andrew L Lewand...It was exactly what I was looking for...But if you are hunting out west this book is the way to go
2,huh?,"i've listened to a few different versions of the tallis fantasia and i have to say they all leave me cold, including this one. hard as i try, i just can't hear what everyone is raving about. yes, i suppose it does kind of remind one of a cathedral, but so what? maybe the problem is that i'm living in a godless age. maybe this number played better when it was composed nearly 100 years ago. whatever. all i know is that to these ears, the tallis sounds more like hype made audible."
5,Vaughn Williams,This is truly beautiful music. It is soft and soothing but it is not elevator music. It has intellectual and emotional depth. Listening to Vaughn Willimas's Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis my imagination was triggered with streams of images and deep feeling.
2,Good Idea But...,"This product sounded great to me when i first saw it. I had been using it for about 2 months and the crank handle snaped. The construction is very weak, the actual power it gives while pluged in is also very weak, the charging is inconsistent and it barely kept my Iphone alive at 10% remaining power. I recommend this device to those that seldom take long trips."
2,Not enough power to charge an iPhone,"I was disappointed in this product, but I should have read the description more closely: The SuperBattery is best described as a battery supplement, and isn't really capable of powering or recharging USB devices. I was hoping I'd be able to turn the crank and light up the ""recharging"" icon on my iPhone, or at least plug the SuperBattery into a wall for twelve hours and then get an hour's worth of juice out of it; instead, I have a device that provides a trickle of power through the USB port, so that my phone's battery takes ten hours to drain instead of eight. This means the SuperBattery is only useful if I know I'll be needing it ten hours in advance, which is not a situation that comes up very often."
2,Dull and dated,"Monogram's 1945 Dillinger is a dreary little B-movie that ignores not just period detail but also anything and everything even remotely interesting about the real-life Public Enemy No. 1 in favor of tired fictional clichés and plenty of stock footage from Fritz Lang's You Only Live Once (which completely stumps John Milius on the audio commentary: unaware of their provenance, he seems to think they're sequences they ran out of money to finish). It does offer a chance to see a young Lawrence Tierney when he still had a full head of hair, but despite some interesting credits (music by Dimitri Tiomkin, an inexplicably Oscar-nominated screenplay by Philip Yordan) that's pretty much all you can say for it."
4,Lawrence Tierney Rules!!!,"Yes, this film feels like a diatribe. It's probably less factual than the film version of John Dillinger's exploits that director John Milius made in the seventies. So why do I recommend this film over Milius' more polished account? Well, this film in a campy, over-the-top way is just so entertaining. Secondly, Lawrence Tierney in the title role is such a magnetic screen presence. His tough ferocity keeps the film's campier elements in check and grounds it in some semblance of reality. There's also a good supporting cast here with gangster veterans Marc Lawrence and Elisha Cook Jr. (seems like he's in all these noir-gangster flicks) on hand. The story is told here crisply and in an economical 70 minutes so if you have an hour plus to kill there's worse ways to do it. Oh, John, if only you had the two bucks to pay for the drinks!"
4,Dillinger,"Poverty Row Monogram's biggest hit dealing with subject matter the major studios agreed not to touch. The budget was so small they had to lift the big heist scene from Fritz Lang's YOU ONLY LIVE ONCE, but the taut little script is well cast. Tierney radiates menace and Edmund Lowe as his jailhouse mentor does a nice deterioration from commanding to sniveling. Nice bits of jarring violence, even if off-screen: a face-mauling w/ a broken beer mug, a gunning down of a sweet old couple, and an ax murder. Good, clean fun. 7/10"
5,excellent casserole,"This is a very nice, heavy pan, just perfect for baking in. I prepared a lasagna and cornbread stuffing within the first couple days and they turned out perfectly and cleanup was painless. It also looks great!"
5,Your Faith Is Your Fortune,Wonderfully insightful book as are all of the books I have read by Neville. The world should read it and heed it.
3,The usual good stuff by Neville,"In this little book Neville expounds the same valuable truths as usual - imagine your wish fulfilled and you will obtain your desires. I.e. while in a meditative state visualize your desires and feel the feelings you would feel were your desires actually fulfilled.He sees the Bible as ""a great psychological drama with all of its characters and actions as the personified qualities and attributes of his own consciousness"" and amongst other things interprets Jesus' twelve disciples as representing ""the twelve qualities of mind which can be controlled and disciplined by man.""If you are not particularly religiously inclined, the frequent references to the Bible may be somewhat offputting. But there is no denying the inherent truth of Neville's message."
3,"good ideas, repetitive and a little too grandiose","I thought the book was good... I mean, as you think so you shall be.. pretty basic and very true statement.. but the author I think has gone too far outside the box here. Claiming the bible is a drama meant to represent this idea of our minds as orchestrators of reality...it's a tough argument to swallow and, honestly, unnecessary in my opinion. Maybe this was just his creative way of showing the reader his philosophy, which is in line with napolean hill, and other new thought ideologies. good ideas, but too repetitive. I must have read the same thing over a hundred times and i get that it's important, but it made the book hard to keep reading."
4,Great book for an election year,"Reading this makes me realize that the Roman empire struggled with the same fundamental questions we struggle with today. Depressing, though, since their civilization collapsed."
2,too complicated,Not written in laymans terms. If it was written a bit simpler I would have read it through.Didn't bother to finish it.
1,Forewarned is forearmed!,"This ""publisher's"" supposed ""commitment to the preservation of printed works""--which in the present case involves issuing a photographic reproduction of an 1845(?) edition of a work in the public domain-- would appear to be nothing more than a money-making gimmick. Envision a text whose early sections are marred by frequent underlining, which is then poorly scanned. Add the unforgiveable fact that not just any pages are entirely missing, but very key pages, and you'll have an idea what this volume offers. Appalling that Amazon or any ""reputable"" bookseller would offer such trash. Do yourself a favor an look at other editions!"
3,For readers with bifocals: a warning,"I read all the reviews of all the various editions of Gibbons and I finally decided on the Womersley. I wanted the footnotes. But when the paperback arrived, I found that the book's print was so small that, even with my bifocals, reading led to headaches (and the footnotes were even smaller). I then bought the Folio Society edition, which cut most of the footnotes but I was able to read it without headaches. Some of the footnotes are critical to understanding the Gibbon, but if you remove the op. cits and Ibids alone, I think two thirds of the footnotes would disappear. I balanced the need for those footnotes with being able to read it at all. For me, the Folio Society set (which I got for $41 on EBay) was well worth the money.JPS"
3,it's a skimmer,"okay, i usually enjoy reading body/mind texts, but this one was a bit dry. there is usefull and thought-proviking information within it, although i had to skip around and skim to find it. sometimes long-winded, sometimes self-reighteous, it is worth the read, but buy it used."
4,Great for the price,"Football fits pretty close, a little play in the two I have. For sitting on a bookshelf, they are great and I dont mind a little movement in the ball."
5,does what it says....,"perfect, it is exactly what it says it is. it was clean and ready to use and was a good buy!"
4,Not quite the right fit,"The case is what I wanted. The only problem, which I overcame, was that the football was about 3/4"""" smaller than the inside of the case. It was not designed for an ""IFL"", (Indoor Football League), football. It is shorter than an NFL football.I had some 1"" clear plastic tubing that I cut into 2 - 3/8"" pieces. They fit the case ends just right and then I mounted my football.Other than the adaptation it is a very nice case."
2,IT IS WHAT IT IS!,"As far as a football case, it is what it is....a clear football case. What I dont like about it is that putting the two plastic covers together is almost like trying to solve Rubiks Cube. You have to get it just right for the two to fit together. For the price its not so bad....I guess once you solve the Cube you dont have a reason to open it again."
4,a! Shub Niggurath!,"Shub Niggurath, the black goat of the wood with a thousand young, is mearly hinted at in H.P. Lovecraft's fiction. Mentioning little more then the name and appellation, old Shubby is shrouded in mystery. Price has compliled here some of the works which have followed Lovecraft's scant clue to define Shub Niggurath. Price includes one of his own stories, a tale sexual decadence, perversion and madness in the name of Shub Niggurath which, of itself, makes the book worth reading."
3,delivers,"Rainey delivers good one here. campbell also has a good story. i was mostt impressed by Spence, unknown to me. the rest o the stories are not so good, but not really bad either. i really like this fertility goddess granting humanity gifts, but demanding worship and sacrifice. ok, an obvious link to paganism. but that makes it realistic. the goat is the creature from the mythos i'm having least problems imagining."
1,faux song,i bought the single MR. BUSINESS MAN when i was a kid in the 60's...thought i'd relive old memories here...so i downloaded it...but...THIS IS A REMAKE....yick
3,pioneer player,"It has all the major components to build a great sound system. The price is just right! I want to buy it, but I can't access my shopping cart."
4,"Nice case, good price","This is a lovely looking case at a very good price. The 3 included fans are a little loud but for about $15 you can get 3 nice, temp-controlled, quiet replacements. Even with the additional $15 for the fans the case is still a good deal.It would have been better to eliminate the ""EVO"" logo on the upper left corner which was not shown in the picture of the case on the web. This was easily fixed with an AMD sticker that came with the processor.Believe it or not this case will actually hold 4 hard drives - a plus for a media center box."
3,Inexpensive but also not a true media center PC,While this I a well made case for the price it is mis labeled as it does not match the standard component measurements. It is ~2.5 inches to narrow and about an inch and a half too long to be (IMHO) a true Media center PC case. Since cases that match a receivers dimensions can be as much as $400 this was a steal. I plan to mount an original Xbox in this beaut to camouflage it from the average observer.
3,Nice looking... could do better on dimensions and layout,"Bought this case mainly because of price and looks. Definitely fits in well with my home theater equipment. It was part of a DIY project to build my own PC and getting things in the case was definitely the trickiest piece. To the point where I had to remove everything just move stuff around.I struggled getting two 3.5"" HDD in here. I also have a Sony blu-ray which slotted in no problem, but had difficulty aligned the drive doors on the case with the blu-ray. Got there in the end but it's tight.Cooling wise I replaced the fans that came with it, they were a little louder than I would've hoped.All in all I think it was a lesson learnt for me... the $40-50 I saved on the case I probably spent on new fans and my own time getting everything in... But all in all it turned out nice and the wife likes the look :)"
4,"Great Case, for the Price","Great looking case, especially with its aluminum face plate. It's almost indistinguishable from any of the A/V systems I have. One thing I would change is to make the case wider to match the width of the standard A/V systems, and not as deep, so it won't stick out of some shallow A/V racks. The case fan on the bottom is loud, so It disconnected it, now it's whisper quiet. Overall I'm content with the purchase."
5,"Beautiful, haunting, personal prose by 5 masters.","This is a very important book from 5 writers who have suffered the unease that comes from being ""neither fish nor fowl"", something I've always felt as a Jew, but never related to other immigrants, expatriates, or those in exile. This book also draws in writers and their craft, the work that comes out of ""homesickness"", the instinct to ""memorialize in prose"". I read this book in a light trance, feeling if but for a moment as if I lived somewhere. Anyone looking for where they come from or even where they got to should read this book."
3,truck man,"I love trucks so I thought it was a great game, but I was pretty dissapointed when I beat the game in less than an hour for the first time. I have played the game through many times, but now I'm sick of it. NOW! dont make the same mistake I made, I looked at the game on the internet and the graphics were outstanding, or so I thought, in fact I bought my dreamcast for this game, right when it came out. Rent the game for a couple of nights and I can asure you you'll have mastered this game and be very sick of it in a couple nights. I spent [$$$] on this game and its not worth it, but don't get me wrong this game is still very fun, maybe only at first"
4,OK Game -- gets tired quickly,"The game is fun, but it could be a little more chalanging. I mean, my brother and myself beet the game in 3 hours the day I bought it. Now I don't think I will play it again. It makes for a good rental, but not a good buy."
4,Fun Fun Fun,This game is lots of fun but can get boring after a while. The drivers will suit everyone. Every thing is real like dennys texeco and pizza hut.
3,Too Short,"The game is way too short, I beat it in an hour. There are only four levels, and after you are used to them they can be beaten in minutes. The parking portion of the game is better than the arcade portion. I haven't played the multiplayer part yet, but dont buy the game because it is too short, worth renting though."
2,NOT for bare floors and H-E-A-V-Y!,"Our floors are primarily tile and hardwood; we also have children and pets. I was excited to find a cheaper alternative to the Dyson, but as previous posters mention it is extremely heavy. In fact I broke a sweat lugging this monster around our 3,200 square foot home! To be fair, the unit is self-propelled on the ""carpet"" setting and it did clean our area rugs beautifully. However, the catch wheel does not spin on the ""bare floor"" setting, and to boot the setting knobs and switches are awkward and very hard to push. Even the step to lower the handle took a serious stomp with my foot to engage! I felt a bit like Wilma Flintstone wrangling a prehistoric machine. All that said, if the suction was decent and actually picked up the dirt on my bare floors, I probably would have kept it - who couldn't use a little workout with their chores? But alas, when bits of dirt were flung back at me or simply spread around, I boxed it back up and returned immediately! Good luck..."
4,Good buy,For the money this is a hard vacuum to beat. First and last it cleans very well. It is heavier than the Kirby it replaced or at least seems so as the Kirby had power assisted movement. Lastly the price for a top tier vacuum cannot be bested.
2,BEWARE!,"As was stated by the vacuum repair expert, the BELT on these things breaks ALL THE TIME!!!! I am constantly trying to find a new one and replace them. Just get the roller brush caught on a piece of string, end of carpet, whatever... and the belt breaks!!! I suggest you look elsewhere. I bought this because of the CONSUMER REPORTS review but FORGET IT!!!!!"
2,Suction sucks!,"I bought this vacuum 2.5 years ago. Up until recently, I have been very pleased with its performance. As of late, the suction on the vacuum has is no existent. I have gone through and cleaned it out and verified that everything looks good and it just doesn't work well anymore."
1,Do not buy this vacuum!,"I bought this vacuum about a year and a half ago. Worked great for a few months, then the power brush for the carpet stopped working, it turned out to be the belt needed replacing. Also the ""carpet/floor"" switch got really hard to operate, and then it got kind of floppy like it wouldn't stay in position. So it worked okay for a few more months, then the same thing happened with the power brush. So I replaced the belt again. This time it didn't work even after I replaced the belt. I believe the carpet/floor switch is completely broken and that is why it won't work."
1,Stay away from this company and vacuum,"I have had always bought a Hoover vacuum but decided to try the Eureka product because Consumer Reports gave it a great review. What a mistake! I have tripped over the cord numerous times, you can not move it from carpet to floor position. Now all the stuff it vacuumed up is coming out of the bottom of the vacuum. NO the bag is not full. I tried twice contacting the Allergy Be Gone to no avail. I don't have the box to send it back because my husband inadvertantly threw it out. I really do not like this vacuum and will go back to a Hoover. They last a long time and have great suction. Also, it is very easy to switch from carpet to bare floor. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT AND ALLERGY BE GONE!!!!"
2,It's OK...,"Suction good. Everything else bad. The hose doesn't stay, doesn't work with the ""bare floor"". I have to sweep & then use the hose. Also, the hose easily chips off at the end.It's also heavy. When you start it up, the thing nearly jumps out of your hand, then the ""auto-mode"" doesn't work anymore. I guess the good news is that it builds your arm muscles.I would pass on this one."
4,Good Dictionary,"Kodansha's Furigana English-Japanese Dictionary is the best dictionary I've found marketed in the U.S. The examples are very useful and the kanji is printed very clearly. This is an excellent dictionary for beginners and helpful to intermediate-level students. The volcabulary is quite basic, so I am often disappointed when I cannot find the word I am looking for. A wonderful dictionary is the second addition of Taishukan's Genius English-Japanese Dictionary. This is the number 1 dictionary in Japan right now. While it unfortunately does not have furigana, it contains an extensive amount of useful examples and I have always been able to find the word I was searching for. I have not seen it in the states, but for foreigners living in Japan, it is an invaluable resource. I just wish someone would put furigana in it!"
2,Blech!!!,"I bought this book based solely on the reviews I read on Amazon. What a disappointment. I love a good romance, but I think too many romance readers out there are too easily pleased. As long as the author manages to string a few coherent sentences together, it's reviewed as ""THE BEST BOOK EVER!!!!!"" Maybe I'm too picky, but I know I'd certainly appreciate reading more critical reviews.That said, I want more from a book than one dimensional characters who seem to have only one genuine emotion -- lust. This novel's heroine is beyond vapid -- she's stupid and annoying, and her love interest isn't much better. I'm not going to re-summarize the plot since I'm sure another review already has. Let's just say if you enjoy cotten candy, this book's for you. If you're looking for something with more substance, I'd keep on searching.Good luck!"
4,Irresistible,A page turner that keeps you up all night. Impossible to put down.Funny with wacky characters that you would adore to have in your life.Irresistible and wickedly hilarious.Truly compelling.
5,"Loved it, and reading other books by this author","I didn't know what to expect, I saw her books in the book store and decided to give her a try. It was such a refreshing read! I laughed and felt bad for her, and rooted for her when times were tough. It was a funny and sarcastic read, very enjoyable, but not quite a beach read. I recommend it if you want a fun ride with funny Irish charachters.The main charachter's husband leaves her right after she gave birth to their daughter. She moves back to her parent's house, and starts living with her crazy and disfunctional family. Throughout couple of months, she learns how to deal with the new status as a mother, copes with her ""watermelon"" shape and weight, and finds love in her hectic and screwed up (in a good way of sorts) life."
3,A cute story that is written in a funny and clever way,"I didn't really love this book, nor did I dislike it. I feel pretty neutral about it. It is the sort of story that I will not think of again after I finished it, yet I am glad that I read it.The story begins with Claire, a sweet Irish woman, who is dumped by her husband in the hospital delivery room after she gives birth to their only child. It is told from Claire's perspective, and it is the story of her healing and moving on after the traumatic incident of her husband's abandonment. The book is quite funny and you will like most of the characters. You will find yourself cheering for Claire to get over her selfish and disrespectful husband. The ending is excellent and it leaves you with a happy feeling and a smile.Claire and her family can be found again in other Marian Keyes books. So far, I like ""Rachel's Holiday"" better than ""Watermelon"". I do have all of Marian Keyes other books, and I am planning on reading them in the near future."
1,Not even close to Maeve Binchy-style,"I love Maeve Binchy and was looking for recommendations of similar writers/stories -- this is NOT it. Other than having ""family in Ireland"", that is where the similarities ended. There was no depth to any of the characters, just a lot of surface generalizations, i.e., Mom can't cook, Anna is a ""flower child"", Dad is a pushover, Helen is spoiled. I wasn't even able to muster up much empathy for the main character (really? you're 29 years old and you run home to your overly accommodating parents to wallow in self-pity for over a month?) I spent so much time skimming over the imaginary conversations this character kept having in her head and kept wishing there was more meat to the story. Perhaps if I wasn't expecting so much, I wouldn't have been so disappointed."
5,What a great book!,"I finished this book in one day. When I'd put it down, I couldn't wait to get back to Claire and her life. I really felt like part of the book--the way it's written is great. I laughed along with the main character (and cried too!) I'm eagerly awaiting her new novel Lucy Sullivan is Getting Married. Sounds good! (By the way-Crown Books sells it cheap!!)"
4,Excellent,This is an excellent first novel to be followed by Lucy Sullivan got Married and then Rachel's Holiday which will leave you holding your sides in parts. Buy all three.
3,Falling flat,"Watermelon's heroine, Claire, springs to life with a tantalizing beginning, ""February the fifteenth is a very special day for me. It is the day I gave birth to my first child. It is also the day my husband left me."" Claire splits London and heads back to Dublin to stay with her eccentric family. Actually, they aren't as bizarre as one would hope. They are in fact quite dull. Claire, although likeable, never truly strikes one as compelling. Her pining for her husband becomes slightly trivial. Her bout of depression uncorks when she flings herself into a wild crush with a younger man who likes her because he thinks she is ""nice"". Ms. Keyes writing style tends to flood the pages with incessant detail. She is both a shower and a teller, but her telling becomes clipped and useless after awhile. The conversations feel forced. The hope was for a quick humorous read but it didn't happen with this book."
1,A waste of time and money,"The fact that her husband tells her he is leaving her the day after the birth of their daughter is the only original thing I could found in the book. For the rest... a shallow, selfish and immature woman's ego trip. And the end! Her husband cheats on her because he loves her too much? Oh, boy! And predictably, she has fallen in love with someone else... in a month!"
3,Thin characters. Mediocre plot. Goes nowhere.,"This book really wants to go somewhere but never arrives. The characters were either two-dimensional, unlikeable or thinly written caricatures. The plot seems to wind around to nowhere. Even the main conflict turns out to end in a whiney shouting match that left me thinking...""is that it?"" I was only mildly interested in what would happen at the end. This is not a book I could ever recommend to my girlfriends. Too dull and goes nowhere. Some of the dialog was amusing so I gave it 3-stars instead of 2."
5,Another classic from Keyes!!,"If you ask me, this woman is a genius. I love her work. Sure, they are easy to read, but there is always a serious plot and I think Keyes (Irish, not British)handles them superbly. By far my favorite author!"
3,Good but not great,"I bought this book as a book club read. It's not exactly that type of reading and I don't know what we're going to talk about with it. There's nothing deep about it, nothing really even worth discussing. That said, it's not a horrible book. It's just something to read when you just want something simple and easy."
4,The first book about the family...,"I chose this book based on a Listmania, and really enjoyed reading Keyes' book. The book is a little over-descriptive at times, but has a good story to follow. This is the first of 4 books about this family, and I am currently on the second. I ordered them all after reading this one. Claire, the main character, has a hard time dealing with her loser husband leaving her. There is a lot of driking in the book (Oddly enough it takes place in Ireland), and a lot of conflict between all of the characters. However, this is very similar to how this would all play out in real life...This is a good story of really rough times, but that makes you want to follow it."
4,Watermelon makes you want to come back for more,"Watermelon was another story of a wonderfully dysfunctional Irish family. This is a fun, light book. Claire's husband leaves her a few hours after delivering her first child. Any woman's worst nightmare! Marian Keyes manages to take this tragedy and turn it into a comedy and romance. Claire moves back into her parents house and let the hilarity begin. If this is your first Marian Keyes book, be forewarned, there ARE a lot of characters and family members to keep up with. However if you like this family Marian Keyes has several more books to keep you up to date with the rest of this quirky yet loveable clan."
2,Her worst book,"Having started this book eagerly after ""Is Anyone Out There?"", I was amazed it was the same author. This book had a good story line possibility: however it never filled out. I didn't like Claire by midpoint of the book, and it didn't get better. She was so wishywashy about everything! And by the time she and James were meeting to talk, I felt she deserved him. He seemed a bit of a sociopath to me, and many parts just didn't seem to add up at all. At the end I didn't care what happened to her. I had ordered this book along with several others.Thankfully, ""Rachel's Holiday"" was next, and renewed my faith in Ms. Keyes."
4,Very entertaining!,I love Marian Keyes books and this one was great! An easy read that's always entertaining.
4,"Hilarious, insightful, and real.","This book was an excellent read. I picked it up at a discount store thinking it was typical trashy chick-lit. What I found was a book that surprisingly digs into human nature and battles some tough ""coming to terms with yourself"" issues. The plot never slows. This is a great read."
4,"Fun read, kinda predictible but great language","Well, I have to admit I wasn't all that surprised by her husband leaving her in the first chapter - that was made pretty clear on the cover. The character goes through the expected anger, denial, bargaining, etc. and the ending was WAY too convenient but the internal dialogue that the character had was a HOOT to read. It reminded me of a kind of female version of ""High Fidelity"" - in a ""is that what we really think?"" kind of way. I really enjoyed reading about the quirky family in Dublin. Indeed, the main character is neurotic, obsessed, and very similar to Bridget Jones and Ally McBeal but that seems to be the trend in female characterization - not something I'm overjoyed about but, hey, it's fun to read."
5,Better than Bridget Jones,"For those who appreciate British humor, this is a fantastic read. A engaging story of self-discovery, family, and relationships. I'm anxious for Ms. Keyes next novel. I found this one funnier and more enjoyable than Bridget Jones' Diary."
4,"Light summer read, Irish charm. Fun","Well, it's not great literature, but then no one promised it would be. And it's predictable and dredges up a host of Irish cliches for characters - but they're all charming or unrepentent or hilarious. And it's a bit too long, being essentially fluff.However, it's a fun read, it goes quickly, and you do - trust me - end up caring about the characters.Claire gives birth to her first daughter and is deserted by her husband in the space of a few hours. She hightails it back to her dysfunctional and wacky family in Dublin - dysfunctional as only an Irish family can be. There she retreats to the triple cure of vodka, exercise, and a younger man - and of course the wayward hubby comes crawling back with his, um, tail between his legs...It's a hoot and a half."
1,First Novel-itis,"This book has ""first novel"" written all over it. It's desperate attempts to come off as hip and clever, merely seem precious. The characters are not believable, the comically ""quirky"" family is contrived, the ""hilarious"" sex girl-talk is just embarrassing. Maybe her other books are better."
5,Outrageously funny!.,The funniest novel I have EVER had the pleasure to read!. Recommend it to the planet.....can't wait for more!.
2,I really wanted to like this book.........,"I really wanted to like this book, but alas I came away rather disappointed. I just did not find it as laugh out loud funny as many of the reviewers. The writing is weak, the plot predictable and the characters rather shallow. I am a huge fan of British humor, but I would advise readers to give this one a pass."
2,Disappointing...,"After having read ""The other side of the story"", which was complex and multidimensional, I assumed all the other books by this author would be similar. Unfortunately, this one was the opposite - very predictable and boring. And the main character was too neurotic for my taste. I still liked the writing style, that's the only reason I finished the book."
3,not my cup of tea,Generally I don't care much for this kind of story. It had a clingy feel. Like the main character was basing too much of her need for support in a dependent manner. But I did feel like it was written in a fresh way and I didn't feel it was a waste of my time. I read the whole thing even though I didn't care for the whole premise of the story.
1,Are you kidding me?,I couldn't even finish this ridiculous book. I hope no one reads this and thinks it represents real life. I'm not sure if the author is a mother...guessing not...but she is obviously not a good writer.
2,Disappointing,"I have to say I bought this book with great expectations - maybe this was the reason for my big disappointment.I've watched a TV series based on Keyes' book Lucy Sullivan is Getting Married and enjoyed it so much that I was sure her other books would be funny/interesting as well. But this book was boring. It took me about 3 months to finish it, and I started reading a different book while still reading it, because it was too boring for me. Only a director with a lot of imagination could turn it into a lovely TV series..."
1,what is all the fuss about?,"People seem to love this book - I do not know why. I bought Watermelon at a regular bookstore, so I have no excuse not to have perused the contents prior to making the purchase. I tried valiantly to finish this book - but few things have struck me as such a waste of time. I had removed the price tag when I began reading, by soon found myself finding the discarded piece of sticker, unfolding it and sticking it back on the book in an attempt to return it to where I purchased it. Alas, I neglected to do that in a timely manner, and now am just an embarrassed owner of this book...I will never finish it - but will always be reminded of the foolishness of buying a book based on the concept and raves of everyone around me - or maybe it was just the clever product placement. To be fair to the author I think it would make a better stand-up comedy routine than a novel."
2,High hopes and then ...,"Starting the book was mainly fun but 2/3rds through it began to drag. At the end I just felt sorry for the main character and wondered why I am reading it. I am missing the last 15 pages and only am going to finish reading it because I hate to leave a book after 90% ... But never the less, if you like reading books and dont mind leaving it go after 60% it is fun to read ..."
1,A waste of time and money,"The main reason that I purchased ""Watermelon"" is that I really liked ""Lucy Sullivan is getting Married"" by Marian Keyes. But ""Watermelon"" is such a bad book. I found the main character Claire Webster to one of the unlikeable characters ever! And don't even start me on her crazy family. I couldn't even keep their names straight. I just don't understand how this book could be such a bestseller.Unless you are a fan of Marian Keyes, you may want to skip this book at all costs!"
3,very entertaining,"Yes, I agree, not nearly as crisply written as Bridget Jones Diary or High Fidelity, and the narrator's talking to her audience felt rather sophomoric. Still, it was an engrossing, if predictable story and the relationships between family members and their good natured skewering of each other was lots of fun to read. I also enjoyed the Irish humor, dialect and sensibility."
4,A lovely read,"Oh, how I love U.K. chick lit! Marian Keyes never disappoints. I love the characters and the relationships in this book. I couldn't help but get a bit irritated with the main character being a total pushover, but all was forgiven by the end of this addicting book."
3,Rarely can you find a book that is like this,"I can't tell anyone that this is the best books I have ever read because it is not. But it is good, to the point of being hard to put down.Claire Webster, has just had a baby and found out in the same day that her husband has been having an affair with a downstairs neighbor. So, James (the husband) is leaving her and the newborn to run off with the mistress. Claire makes a mad dash for Dublin to live with her crazy family. She, finally after not showering for sometime, gets herself back together and goes out into the world to find a handsome classmate of her younger sister.After reading this book I have put some faith into more of Marian Keyes books. This may not be the best but it is the first."
4,This book stole a Sunday from me!,"I bought this book yesterday morning and stayed up until 2:30 reading it. It was a great read! I loved the character development, I was rooting for Claire, I despised James and got nervous every time a scene involved Helen. My particular favorite part was Claire's description of being a waitress. That was so accurate and hilarious!I grew a little impatient at the end and must admit that I skipped a lot of Claire's self talk and scanned the text for quote marks so I could get through it faster. But I have already bought this for someone else, I've recommended it to everyone at work and hope to read Lucy Sullivan next Sunday! Thank you Ms. Keyes!"
3,Fun beach read but somewhat annoying at times,"I picked this book up to read on vacation. It was fun, but the writing style tended to get on my nerves at times. A lot of one line writing that seemed to go on and on, driving the joke beyond the point of funniness. Also, the ending dragged on a bit too much and was far too predictable. All in all though, an easy, light read with some very funny moments."
4,Entertaining...,"""Watermelon"" by Marion Keyes is a most entertaining story. A sad (but also at times) funny tale dealing with the frustrations of life and love.The characters are easy to connect with, the dialogue moves right along and the plot as I said before is most entertaining.A wonderful effort on the part of the writer!John SavoySavoy InternationalMotion Pictures Inc."
4,Good Summer Reading,"Being a fan of the Brit Chic novel, I really enjoyed this book. Claire is a wonderful heroine -- she's been left on the day that she gives birth by her husband and so she goes to her native Dublin to hang out with her (so-hilarious-you-wish-they-were-yours) family. Her gorgeous, self-involved sister Helen, her other hippie flaky sister Anna, her sweet mother who can't cook, and her concerned yet slightly aloof father, all round out this novel to make a great story. This is the perfect light beach read, and at 417 pages, the book will last longer than a lot of other light beach reads."
2,Sigh...,"This book had so much potential because the story is interesting and the characters endear themselves to you. Keyes, the author, ruins her book in the following way. She has this irritating tendency to explain her punch lines as though her audience consists of thick skulled neanderthals. Also, I found her rambling on style to be tedious. The heroine over-reacts to everything and mulls over and over-analyzes everything to the point of nausea."
2,"Cute, funny, and sad.","Watermelon was a fun book to read -- I finished it in a day. But after reading Keyes's Lucy Sullivan, I was disappointed in Watermelon. Although both books had many of the same elements, I had a hard time relating to Watermelon's Claire. Claire's husband tells her that he is leaving her while she is in the hospital, having just delivered their first child. Claire flies home to her parents and sisters with her new baby and begins to heal. Only Marian Keyes can make a plot like this with laugh out loud humor. This is a book about heartbreak, survival and the importance of loving and supportive family."
2,lucy sullivan we miss you,"A big disappointment after Lucy Sullivan. Her clothes are too tight, she drinks too much, and, worst of all, she doesn't know who she is or what she wants. It is hard to feel much empathy for the new mother who stars in this novel."
4,Funny fast read,"I was looking forward to reading ""Watermelon"" as I have been in a similar situation to Claire myself. I found it to be a really good light (but not trashy) read. The book is written as if Claire is talking to you, which means you really identify with her and all her insecurities. It was great when Claire realized that she was fine just the way she was and that she didn't need anyone in her life who couldn't accept that. Claire's family were excellent secondary characters, I can't wait to read ""Rachel's Holiday"" to hear more about them. Adam seemed a bit too good to be true, or maybe I'm just looking in the wrong places! The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is that I have also read ""Lucy Sullivan Is Getting Married"" and it had quite a lot more plot and was heaps longer than ""Watermelon"". Marian Keyes' books are so enjoyable to read, it's disappointing to have them end as quickly as ""Watermelon"" did."
5,Read anything you find by Marian Keyes; then wait for more,"Loved it! Now I want to see a BBC/A&E telemovie version.Although ""Lucy Sullivan is Getting Married"" was great, I was unsure about reading ""Watermelon"". A novel in which the herione gives birth and gets dumped by her husband on the first page seemed a little intimidating. It sat on my bookshelf for a few weeks despite my faith in Keyes' storytelling skills.I wondered if it would be: 1)an ""against all odds"", ""surmounting obstacles"", ""girlpower"" book; 2)a male-bashing ""can't live with them/can't live without them"" book; and/or 3)a novel which reinforces the strategic/disaster recovery recommendations found in self-help books? Well, its all of these things; however, the ""good for you"" messages are delivered subtly and with humor.This book is a great escape for the overwelmed. It's uplifting and fun.PS-Read ""Watermelon"" before ""Rachel's Holiday"" to get a better sense of Clair and Rachel's family."
4,Literally LOL,"This book had me literally laughing out loud. Claire, the main character is a 29 year old woman who gave birth and whose husband left her on the very same day. She moved from London to Dublin to recover with her quirky, nutty family. Once there, she meets Adam...the perfect specimin of a man (like Derek Jeter)...who's interested in her! The internal conversations that Claire has with herself are completely neurotic, yet you can identify with them at the same time. I definitly recommend this book for some light, relaxing reading."
5,"Hilariously funny, a great debut novel","'Watermelon' is hilariously funny. It was Keyes' first novel, and is about Claire, who is dumped by her husband just as she's about to give birth... yes, Keyes can and does turn that into a comedy! The book is set mostly in Dublin, and deals in a humorous way with themes such as coping with a new baby and no partner and returning home to live with parents after having lived away from home for several years. Oh, and men do come into it as well...I laughed, I cried, and I was smiling when I reached the end of it. One of the best of the genre."
2,irritating,"This book is far too long for what it is trying to say. The writing is really really annoying, esp. the parts when different emotions like guilt and shame have conversations. Its so silly that it makes u feel like a nit wit. You're better of reading some of her other books or books by different authors. if your a chick-lit veteran, you're not going to like this book."
2,I just couldn't get into it,"I'm sorry but I just couldn't read through it. I thought it was dry and boring and depressing. There were a few parts that were ok, but overall it didn't do much for me."
4,"quirky, funny -- a good read","I had just come off reading the Trials of Tiffany Trott and wasn't in a mood for another ""Poor me, Why am I single?"" book. And at first, that's what I thought I was getting. But I gave Claire a chance (and the writing style -- it took me a while to get used to that kind of narrative) and I ended up really liking her and the book. The characters and quick prose kept me very interested. I wouldn't recommend this book to someone looking for a serious piece of literature, but if you're looking for something fun and light -- this book is great!"
3,This book is more like 3 and a half stars,"This isn't the best book ever, not even the best book I ever read, not even close. However it is worth reading, especially if a good laugh will make you a little forgiving about certain weak spots in the book. And this book does provide a good laugh. Several, in fact. I can say this about Watermelon: It's hilarious. Really. Literally laugh out loud. I think that stands on its own. Give it a try....and don't be put off when you're first reading it, if it seems a little TOO over the top: the book eventually find a rhythm and carries it well towards the (predictable) ending."
5,A good time!,I thoroughly enjoyed Claire's internal monologue. The character has a conversation with her reader as she tells the story! I love it! The writing in this story was outstanding. I kept thinking of when I could get back to Kate and her story! :)
3,"Okay, but not great.",This was an okay read. I like her other books better. I also liked Good in Bed better for a similar type of book.
3,last chance saloon was a better read,This book was entertaining...I enjoyed Last Chance Saloon much better!Watermelon was a little disappointing after reading last chance saloon
4,A good book,"This book chronicles Claire's feelings as she is divorced by her husband. She came to terms with herself, her new baby and their perdicament. She even manages to find a betterside of herself and happiness as she embraces the challanges life has hoisted upon her. A good book, a light read and something you won't want to put down."
4,Not one bad seed in this Watermelon!!,"I've had this book sitting, waiting patiently to be read on my book shelf for quite some time. Wow, am I I glad I finally picked it up!! I read this book in 3 days and put off friends and several hours of sleep to get through it. The main character, Claire is so three dimensional I was able to relate to many of her sentiments, struggles, and triumphs. Her thoughts were depicted to perfection, to the point where I wondered if the author, Marian Keyes, had been through similar instances in her life and written a diary to go back to her thoughts later on while writing Watermelon. I loved Claire's 'analyze everything to death' character and all of the messes she got into (& out of). This is really a novel about relationships, heartbreak, & survival. Most women will relate to & love this fun book!"
3,Just O.K.,"Having never read anything by this author before, I decided to purchase this book after reading some of the positive reviews. In general, I enjoyed the story . . . but the characters were not developed well AT ALL. The story made it seem as if the baby was just left in a room all day . . . and not really given much thought. I didn't really ""get"" Claire's family. Like I said, the characters were not well developed so it made it hard to feel connected to them. Some of the story lines were a bit far-fetched and a little hard to believe.Having only read one of her books, I'm not inclined to write this author off just yet. However, I hope this is one of her less inspired writings."
2,"Uh, well...","I liked this book.Despite the fact that I found it unbelievable and wanted many times to smack various characters, this book is perfect for the day at the pool with a margarita in one hand and a novel in the other.For much more than that, I fear it will fall short.I get the sense that the author sat down and made up the entire story as she went along. The majority of characters are caricatures of old standards, and they all contain that particular quirk or eccentricity particular to characters in novels of British origin. But they are funny.It's froth, of the type found on milkshakes. But then, an occasional milkshake isn't such a bad thing."
4,Really Good and Really Funny!,"""Watermelon"" is one of those ""feel good"" books. Claire's husband James is being a real jerk so she and baby Kate leave London to go to Dublin to stay with their family. Claire finds living with her parents and two younger sisters proves to be difficult after being on her own. Then Adam comes into the picture and Claire's whole life gets turned upside down. Adam has to be the best thing that ever could happen to Claire. This book is so good that I read it in 2 days."
4,Add this one to your list!,"I don't try to analyze why I do or don't care for certain books or authors, I just know that by selecting a couple of pages at random, I can sense whether the writing style suits me or not. I'm a simple guy, when I find an author I like, I buy all of his or her (or their) books. I like P.J.Tracy enough to put them into that category. Am I suggesting you go on a binge and buy everything they write? Nah, that would make you as unstable as me. I DO however suggest you sample the offerings of this mother/daughter writing team. You just might like what they do."
4,good read,It was more fun and more complicated than I expected. Good mystery and I look forward to other books in the series.
4,Read it 6 years ago. Better the 2nd time.,Read it 6 years ago. Reading the rest of the books in the series now. Thought I would reread the first to refresh the brain cells. It was good before it is better the 2nd time. I love all the charaters.
1,Ok plot,"but cliched. It was fun to read, but more than anything it was a ""fluff"" book - one that I read when I just want something light. Pretty much forgetable."
3,"Fascinating plot, interesting characters, but...","""Monkeewrench"" has a fascinating plot and interestingcharacters and interrelationships. But it has far toomuch profanity and gutter language. I won't read anotherby P. J. Tracy. Sorry. And I wanted so much to be ableto rave about this work by fellow Minnesotans..."
5,Want to Play ??,"A Killer is at work in Minneapolis. Two bodies are found- both are treated as unrelated but a games creator Grace McBride knows different. Some how these games are exact copies of that in a game that she's designing. As the copycat killings mount up, Grace knows that she and her Monkeywrench team are both suspects and potential victims. With the serial killer getting closer, she is drawn into a murderous game of cat and mouse.This is a thrilling page turner with a nail biting finish.Hope you enjoy it"
1,MONKEEWRENCH,Not into computer stuff.......liked the names..... it was kind of predictable.....insite in to journey to crime & how co operation is necessary
3,Expected More,I thought I would like this story better than I did. I have read another Monkeewrench story since and liked it much better. I doubt I will read any more P J Tracy novels.
4,More than your usual serial killer tale.,5 chic computer geeks design a computer game that contains murders a real life killer is imitating.They try to find the killer before one of their own becomes the next victim.In the meantime 2 separate groups of police are working the case.If it seems like there's a lot of characters it's because there are!The writers skillfully juggle several colorful people while spinning an engrossing mystery.Witty repartee and a mystery that will keep you guessing to the gripping climax make this a great read for any suspense fan.A great debut novel by P.J. Tracy!
5,What a story!,"This is a sensational read! A group of 30 something college friends forms a a very successful company which makes computer games. They are in the process of developing a murder game when, to their horror, a serial killer begins to copy the style of murders outlined in the new game.The murders begin in a church in a small town in Wisconsin, leaving the local police with the impression that it is a one-off retribution killing until a team of detectives in Minneapolis links the murders with a series of slayings in their own city.It's a fast, exciting story with a few red herrings thrown in to keep the reader on his toes. Be prepared to read it in a short space of time as you won't be able to put it down."
5,Outstanding first thriller...,"This is an awesome book. It took me a bit to get into it (about 40 pages) and once I did, I was hooked. I loved the characters--the two sets of dectectives are wonderful. Dr. ""Rambo"" is just a wonderful creation as well. Not, that I have overused ""wonderful"", I will stop with that. Our authors have crafted a tight, funny, surprising mystery. I loved the midwest feel and genuine people in the book. Read it!"
4,First rate first effort!,"This book is an excellent debut by a gifted writing team, though at times it becomes somewhat predictable. It is not the typical edge-of-your-seat suspense thriller, but it held my interest. I would recommed this book & will definitely read P.J. Tracy again."
4,A great page turner,"Being a full time student, employee, mother, spouse, and pet owner I have little time for reading during most of the year. June and July are the months that I catch up on all my summer reading averaging a book a week...I finished this book in just a few days. I could not put it down! In light of the debates surrounding video games this book just adds fuel to the fire...however these characters actually have backbones, intelligence, and consciences. The plot development is thorough and rich; and the authors take you where they want you to go!I can usually anticpate the ending - but this one...this one, I didn't see coming!Again, a great summer read - one that will leaving you turning the pages and rooting for all the characters to solve the mystery! Get it and enjoy it! You won't regret doing so :)I can't wait until their next book!!!"
3,"""Monkeewrench"" -had possibilities if not for so much profanity","The story line was very difficult to follow. It jumped from scene and situation too sporadically. The profanity was very distracting. I doubt it would have been one third as long if the profanity was taken out. The language doesn't add to but rather distracts from the plot.I won this in a giveaway and although I appreciate authors offering their books to these giveaways, I would never add this one to my library."
5,A Great Find!,"I happened upon this book, bought it on a whim, and read it in a day. It is well written with interesting characters and a great plot. I'm already looking for the next one and hoping that this becomes a series!"
3,"A Thriller typical for TV, a mainstream book for the summer","It is a good summer read. It is above average and it is time good spent.But I can't follow the 5 star reviews of other readers. The story is forseeable many times. Even the solution is not that surprising. And the reason why the killer killed was so disappointing and reasoning so short, that it was sad that the book got to a close so quickly. Though the storry is smart and has many good twists, it is quiet mainstream. A quick read. I had some problem to really connect with the characters. The story has too many characters to follow and they are as shallow as in those TV thrillers. It is not much more than you would actually see on the sreen. But I will try the next book, if P.C. Tracy keeps up writing."
2,One to many writers,"From the beginning it was obivious that the book was written by two authors with different styles. This combined effort didn't work for me. I know this was ficton but so much was too unbelievable. The friendships between the main character Grace and her friends was hard to accept it was too extreme. The way Grace lived if you called that living didn't make me feel empathic it just annoyed me. Their secret past, the 2 mysteries and the past mystery didn't hold my interest. The authors tried too hard to make a complex suspense.There was no suspense, no build up because I figured it out before page 75 and I wasn't even trying. One simple sentence gave the plot away. From them on it was down hill. I never try to figure out ""who did it.""I only finished the book to see if I was right.It wasn't the worst book I've read but I don't recommend it."
2,Not great,"My son really wanted a Wiggles cake for his birthday, and I thought this would be great. I was very disapointed when I opened the package.You get the balloons, the 'wiggles' sign, a *tiny* bag of sprinkles (there were so few, I didn't even use them), and the Wiggles car. The Wiggles in the car are... not right. My son said it best when he said ""mommy, why are the Wiggles mad?"" They have horrible expressions on their faces, like they all look like Dr Spock with weird raised eyebrows and skinny long faces. Very weird.I ended up using it for his cake, but I'll warn you that if I had known what it was going to look like, I would have bought something else or figured out a way to decorate it myself.Do Not Buy This Product."
5,Just As Funny As Fifty Years Ago!,"These are treasured memories from my early college days, and they are as hilarious and as fresh now as they ever were - good clean humor that brings on big belly laughs...Good for the body, mind and spirit. Andy Griffith was a one-of-a kind gifted comedian, and these stories, told in his inimitable North Carolina ""country boy"" accent are brilliant and ageless. Young and old can appreciate his take on subjects such as football, Romeo and Juliet - and more."
5,We will miss Andy Griffith and all he stood for in America,"The product was as promised, seller can't help the slowness of the USPS. I am enjoying the memories this CD brought back to me when comedy routines didn't rely on vulgarity and profanity."
4,Laughing out Loud,Grew up listening to this on record and wanted to share it with my boy friend. It is as funny as I remember and laughter is healing to the soul.
4,Football is Funny,"I bought this CD for the football story. Since superbowl time was upon us, I wanted to share this memory of my childhood with my two sons. I remember my mother and I listening to Andy's story of a hillbilly watching his first football game and laughing hysterically. After I ordered this CD, I worried that my two sons (ages 15 and 11) would think it was lame. However, it did not disappoint; both boys laughed as I did and I still find them imitating Andy.The other stories on the CD were a bonus and most just as funny."
3,Good,"My Daddy really liked this, but he was disappointed it was not as long as he thought it would be."
4,Making it simple,"This CD is very entertaining and charming. The sections that simplify English Literature, Shakespeare are great to use with your students within a unit of study."
1,Not a good sound quality,We did not care for the sound quality. The canned laugh was irritating . We did enjoy the stories and jokes.
3,"Nice, but not enough . . .","With all due respect to Andy Griffith as a storyteller, there are a couple of problems with this CD. First of all, it lacks the ""No Time for Sergeants"" song found on the old LP version. Next, the mix of the stories with the musical performances lacks a clear direction. Finally, the material is almost exactly duplicated on the AMERICAN ORIGINALS album. Capitol would be doing fans a favor by combining the two albums and including ""No Time for Sergeants""--they would all fit on one disc, and savvy justaposition of tracks would make an entertaining hour."
3,Down Home With Andy,We watched Andy when he first began to guest on various TV shows and thoroughly enjoyed his routines. Due to the fact that his body language and facial expressions were a large part of his humor we had to recall that aspect but listening to the CD made us laugh all over again.
1,Disapointing,"I do not understand why it is called ""What It Was, Was Football (Part 1 and 2). This does not have all of the origial version, so how can it be Part 1 and 2? I should have listened to it first and I sure would not have purchased it. Live and learn."
3,"Well, it wasn't terrible or anything...","...but it wasn't that funny, either. And we know funny!! :-)Got this for a road trip, we'd been hootin' and hollerin' at the Jerry Clower, Lewis Grizzard and ""Blue Collar Tour"" CDs, but we just took this one out early, nary a hoot nor a holler. Nothing against ol' Andy.........."
1,Cheap Product,"My 7 y/o wanted this for his birthday and evertime it came on a commercial, he just went bonkers thinking it would be so much fun. It worked for a few times and then it would not stay flat. He was so discouraged, he put it in a cabinet and has yet to touch it again. This was a worthless product and a very dissappointing birthday present."
1,Not as advertised,"The advertisement on TV states ""Throw a disk, catch a ball"". Unless you perfectly time the throw, this does not happen. After 2 hours of trying, my sons (5 & 8) have given up in tears. We read the instructions and have tried everything but this is a phlop!"
3,creator has a master plan,"I purchased this item as a gift for someone. It was good, but it wasn't the version that he wanted"
2,Size not clear from description,This is very tiny & appropiate to a corner of a budgie cage at best.
4,hungarian groove,"Why can't we get ""Shalom"" outside of Hungary? The best tracks on ""Astronaut"" come from that album, with awesome Hungarian folk singing mixed over the rhythms. This is a best-of compilation for export, not sold in Hungary, and it's a great introduction to one of the top electronica bands in Europe today. Some of the tracks are straightforward drum & bass, others sound distinctly ""eastern europe"" due to the use of traditional melodies. You haven't heard anything *quite* like this before..."
4,Do not miss it!,"It is one of the first albums by Anima Sound System and I think it's much better than newest one. The raw crossover of the traditional hungarian folk and the rolling beats with modern sounds makes you feel the way how exotic and beautiful the hungarian music is. My favorites are ""Csango"" and ""Ket ut van elottem""."
4,really good,"Shalom is even better though. This is good music, and makes you have a really good mood right away. It's the techno version of Sebestyén Márta."
2,"Nice to look at, but....","This book falls way short of my expectations. The book has a grand total of 44 pages -- and 3 of those are totally blank sheets. If you're expecting a story even remotely similar to ""Searching for Bobby Fischer"" you will be very disappointed. If the Waitzkin book is a 10 on the chess prodigy scale then this would surely be a 2 at best. The editorial reviews are almost as long as the book and tell you exactly what's in the book. There is nothing more. If you expect to learn much of anything about this kid you will surely be disappointed. The chapter by Mr. Thaler is the best but only a couple pages long. It is a nicely produced book -- slick paper, hardcover, color photographs -- but the real content could have been summed up in probably less than 10 pages. If you find a copy to borrow and skim it for review you'll have already read the entire book. Save your money. It get's two stars only for the production value of the book and very very limited content."
1,superficial fluff,This book does not convey much of anything. Save your time and money. Read Searching for Bobby Fischer. The details and honesty are lacking in this made for MTV summary of kindergartener makes good.
5,A great reference book -Will not sit on your book shelf,"The first time you receive this book, try to read the entire book. As your symptoms come and go, pull out this handbook and use it as a reference to see how doctors and patients cope with different symptoms and flair ups. When I travel, I always pack this book. Different climates affect each person differently. What may work in your area, will not always work in different parts of the world. Due to the fact I drink plenty of water, my seven year old nephew gave me the nickname of Princess Sponge"
4,It really helped me understand Sjogren's...,"After being given a diagnosis of Sjogren's Syndrome, I really didn't know what it meant. I searched the internet, but really couldn't find any detailed information, so I hit Amazon to find a couple of books. This one was recommended by the Sjogren's Foundation, and was an excellent choice. I was able to see some detailed information, including a break down of the different symptoms. One negative note - it is very medically oriented, so you may need to read through it a few times."
2,Basic Infomation,"I found this book typically medically orientated. It was informative and accurate of the current treatments etc. but to be honest I am grateful I read this book after I had researched many forms of therapy.Otherwise I would have been utterly depressed and without hope for my future. All the 'treatments' offer is symptom relief. There is no mention of improving immune status or joint repair i.e. healing. The list is endless, with the added bonus of all the drug side effects! And what about non invasive forms of pain relief like a simple heat pad? I thought the writers could have offered a lot more for sufferers.Most people flick through the tech stuff to get to the 'how to get well' section, let's be honest.As a health care professional of traditional background, I am realising that there is a huge wealth of info from Alternative Medicine that I once dimissed like my colleagues. Holistic care is the way forward in my opinion. Oh yes, that and fish oil!!!"
3,Not for the uneducated reader.,"This was definitely a helpful book to me--I'm a nurse & I understood what all was being explained. But I also now suffer from Sjogren's Syndrome, ane I really had in mind a more day to day, practical application type book. It was just a lot more scientific than I expected. I would never have bought it had I look through it first."
3,Good info but not what I wanted,It had good info but I wanted something with a patients perspective and in more lay men's terms.It was a tad technical and dry.
5,Everything you wanted to know about SJOGREN'S,"I haven't finished it yet, but, I am really finding out quite a bit about this topic! It is a good read and so informative!The price was great and the book in good condition.Thanks,Deborah"
2,Mediocure at best,"FM reception is poor, I live in NJ and it will pick up nothing from New York City and gets only so-so reception from Philadelphia.My stock radio had better FM reception with every Philadelphia station coming in crystal clear and I was even able to get a couple stations from New York City!XM reception is fine but since the text does not scroll I cannot take advantage of when they say ""look at you XM digital display"" because I only see 7 letters!"
4,Aaliyah Shines!,"Aaliyah shines the most on this soundtrack,her beautiful candy-coated voice melts over all these great songs. I Don't Wanna is my favorite track on the album which showcases her as an extremely sexy and soulful artist. You Have 2 Get This Soundtrack!"
2,c'mon atleast include the dopest song in the movie!,"this would be such a phat cd if it wasnt edited and if the dmx opening song was included.the tite rnb on the cd isnt bad,but it cant hold its own.with out the dmx song or that sick techno song they played when jet li was beating thoses fools with the fire hose this is just an ok disc.the song by confidential is also dope as hell ,but once again its edited. i say just avoid this one and cop the un edited version if they ever release one.peace"
4,Best Soundtrack In Along Time,"The three Aaliyah songs on this cd are hott! Timbaland is one of the greastest producers. His talent shines through on this cd from start to finish.""Try Again"" is the perfect beginning to this cd and ""Come Back In One Peice"" featuring DMX is ""off the hook"" The R&B on the cd is just as strong Joe does an awesome job and has a beautiful voice and Dave Hollister also holds his own on this album. Other Hott songs were ""perfect man"" by destiny's child, ""simply irresistible"" by ginuwine, Timbaland and Magoo's ""We at it again"", Playa's ""Woozy"", and ""rollin raw"" by BG. The only reason why i did not give this soundtrack the full 5 stars is becuase some of the songs by the unknown or less known artist are only mediocre and are a dissapointment to the album over all."
2,Romeo has Died,This CD is weak....The only good tracks are from Aaliyah and Destiny's Child. I thought that B.G. and Timbaland would of brought something to this CD but they didn't. If you like Aaliyah..this is a good CD for her music..but if your getting it to hear the others on this CD...Don't say I didn't warn you.
4,Good Soundtrack but couldv'e been better,"the thing I have with this cd is that it's edited, and the beginning song to the movie sung by DMX isn't on this CD...wondering if his later cd will be included with this song, the rest of the tracks are good like Try Again and I find Confidential's It Really Don't Matter to be a great song on this soundtrack, this might as well be the soundtrack of the year"
4,Don't Read This Review,"if YOU ARE A FAN of Hip Hop, Aaliyah, DMX, or any of the other notables mentioned in any of the other reviews. Because to tell the truth, I AM NOT...What I am tho, is new fan of the Jet Li films and ""Romeo Must Die"" fits right in....even to the point that all the Hip-Hop in the film was very easy to digest.So why review the soundtrack? Well, I wonder why, as did fellow reviewer Mike Rojas, why the soundtrack did not include the powerful orchestral/choral piece that was used not only in the previews for the film but was played over the menu tableau on the DVD as well. I would like to have heard more. Here's 4 stars for all you hip-hoppers out there, minus 1 star for my little bit of disappointment."
3,more timberland and less no names,"i thought that the first six tracks where very good. everything that timberland put his hands to was a hot track. then when you got to the last half of the cd, it became crowded with below average or awful songs by no name artists. i say go by this if you are a huge timberland fan, or there is nothing else to buy."
1,The worst soundtrack i heard!,"It only contains American Rap, and american rap. This movie is about the war between the Blacks and the Chiniese. Its very weird that it is just rap songs."
4,Perfect Cd To Get Your Groove On,"When i saw the ""Romeo Must Die"" movie a while ago, i heard a few of the songs in the background. it sounded pretty good. when i bought the cd, my instinct was right. the cd is pretty good with the tight beats that make you wanna bounce to the music. i love all of the songs by Aaliyah: ""Try Again"", ""Come Back In One Piece"" featuring DMX, ""Are You Feeling Me"" and ""I Don't Wanna"". the song ""Try Again"", has to be the best i heard from her in a while. however there is a slight downfall to the cd. for my tastes in music, i think this cd is a bit too 'hip-hop' for me. i like the R&B tracks on the cd but not really the rap ones. i mean, they ARE good but i like a good song that you can dance to rather than just bop your head. but otherwise than that, this is a good cd worth buying."
4,This cd is kickin,"With about 6 bomb tracks,""Try Again"",""Rose in a concrete world "",Comeback in one piece,We at it again,I don't wanna,Somebody gonna die tonight.Everybody on this cd and I recommend this as a somewhat must-buy. Peaceout"
3,good...but could be better,"all in all this is a tight cd...fresh tracks from aaliyah and dmx but it woulda been a lot better if the DMX song from the opening scene was included. also, an explicit version should be released."
5,Movie and soundtrack goes great together,"How could I've forgot about the Romeo Must Die soundtrack from the year 2000? Even though this was a soundtrack, this was one of Aaliyah's best hits.Featuring an all-star hit roster to bolster 4 tracks by the late songbird, Aaliyah, DMX, Joe, Destiny's Child, VA's own Timabaland & Magoo, Chante Moore, Ginuwine, Playa, Murder Inc's Dave Bing and Lil' Mo, Cash Money's BG, West Coast rapper Mack 10 and movie composer, Stanley Clarke.I don't need to say anymore but this. It should've been named a ""music from and inspired by"" soundtrack because about 5 to 6 songs weren't even featured in the movie. If you remember the movie DMX's song, ""I'm Gonna Crawl"" was featured on The Nutty Professor II: The Klumps movie soundtrack. I was shocked that it wasn't on this soundtrack. My only 2 gripes, but other than that, I was impressed.Romeo definitely lives through this soundtrack, and definitely through the late Aaliyah's stunning singing voice."
4,Good Soundtrack,"This soundtrack is good besides the four Aaliyah songs on there. It features artists like DMX, Destiny's Child, Ginuwine, Joe, and Timbaland/Magoo. However, they introduce relatively unknown artists as well in the latter part of the soundtrack. Overall, the soundtrack is worth checking out especially if you like Aaliyah and other artists."
4,Awesome album - great tracks,Hi! I've seen the movie twice already and the music that goes along with it is simply perfect. The DMX/Aaliyah duet is smooth...it's worth getting the CD!
2,Could Have Been Better!,"The only song I really liked in this album is Track 1 titled ""Try Again"". I guess this is one of those albums where you need to save your money. I mean if you like the song Try Again then I suggest you buy the single and not waste your money on this album. The only reason I gave my review 2 stars is because I'm nice."
2,Not So Good---,"Don't get me wrong, I am a huge Timbaland/Missy/Aaliyah/Magoo/etc. fan, but this soundtrack is really lacking in beats and lyrics....only 4 or 5 of the tracks are produced by Tim, and a couple of them aren't too good....like I said, I am a huge fan, so it is worth it, just for the couple of good tracks...but if I wasn't, I would avoid this......"
3,Dimensions/size are not viewable in description,"I had ordered this item but was not sure of the dimensions so therefore had to cancel the order. If you can provide a twin fitted sheet for XXL size 36"" X 84"" then please let me know where this can be obtained if not through Amazon??!!"
2,Could have been better. Does explain the nice price though.,"I bought two sets of these in a special sale a year ago, Canyon and Lavender flat and fitted sheets and pillowcases. The Canyon set was for a guest bed, and like others, I found that the pockets arent as deep as I'd like. Same for the Lavender set the fitted sheet of which is strung so tight it's a fight to get it on the mattress.Now I like a snug fitted sheet, but whenever it goes on and off the mattress I sincerely fear that I'm about to rip the corners wide open!The last thing of note is actually the most significant to me. These sheets feel like the manufacturer sacrificed the thickness of the fabric to inflate the thread count. They do well enough, but I've had 200 count and 350 count Egyptian sateen with more substance for the price.Don't think I'll be buying these again. Kohl's Sonoma sheets have the same count, but better construction, feel and weight."
2,What size do you need?,"The fabric is lovely.But....This is the fitted sheet, but it is sized for old-type mattresses. Its pockets are not deep enough for the thicker mattresses being sold currently, which require deep pockets."
3,egyptian sateen sheets,the fabric is very nice but the bottom sheet is too loose and the elastic is not strong enough so it doesn't stay on the bed. shipping was on time.
3,Comfortable sheets,"This are comfortable sheets. Only down side is it does not really fit up to a 15 inch mattress as described. I have a Queen Sealy Posturepedic Fenway which is about 60"" W x 80"" D x 13.25"" H. Flat sheet did not fit snug at all, was a bit small. Bought two pairs of fitted and flat sheets... ended up returning one pair. Otherwise it was a good buy."
3,Not worth the money...,"Yes my goodness they are a beautiful shade of green and have a pearly luster that lasted thru 4 washes BUT(!!!) they started to pill in the middle of the fitted sheet (right where you lay!) after only 2 washes. 2 weeks of sleep and they feel awful... im a college student and the special ""buy the flat get the fitted free fit my budget""-- but now i wish i had sucked it up and spent more money-- because im sure i wouldnt be sleeping on pill-ed sheets so soon!!!"
2,not as advertised,"These fitted sheets don't fit my mattresses. Although the description claims that they fit mattresses up to 15"" as has become standard, the packaging states they fit up to 13"". Unfortunately, I had already washed and ironed them before I tried them on the bed and discovered the gaps on each side. They were line dried, too, so I know they didn't do any shrinking in the dryer.The unwrapped set gets returned; looks like I get to pay to ship them back. I am not thrilled about finding and waiting for another set from somewhere else."
1,Does NOT work !,"Followed instructions as available, used thinned automotive paint. Unfortunately the spray gun did NOT perform at all.Would NOT recommend for auto paint. Perhaps water based paints for artwork type uses are fine...."
5,Awesome Product!,"Just what I was looking for. I transfer my Zune between the car, the house, and for light use outside i.e. walking, hiking, etc. This was the only product I could find that allows easy transferral between car and home- I didn't have to pry off an acryllic case. The belt clip is super useful-i usually clip it to my camelbak when I'm hiking, AND it has a kick stand-the only leather case with both a clip and a kick stand! Price was a little high, but it was worth it."
5,Target,It is going to be a pleasure to unload my weapons in to the picture of the number one degenerate of humanity.
1,Disclaimer not given,"This seemed like a good product however when i went to purchase these targets there was no disclaimer letting me know that it was restricted in the state of Massachusetts. If i am paying for a product that can't be shipped it should not be sold. I am an adult and was told by Customer service that because age could not be verified I could not get what I paid for, I would not recommend Sportsmans Guide or if you attempt to buy something through them make sure they will send it to your State of dwelling."
4,terrorist target,"Targets were just as pictured, came in cardboard tube. so theyw ere safely packed and of heavy paper so theyre of good qaulity. will be buying more soon"
5,The very best of Gary Lewis and the Playboys,"I love this album because the music always takes me back to a time in my life when I was young, beautiful and didn't have a care in the world. Music does that for me and fills my life with beautiful memories and I think that is why GOD gave us music in the first place.Very sincerely, Gloria Hooper"
4,The Best of Gary Lewis,"This is really a good value for the majority of hit songs which are included in this album. I am often disappointed with compilations that throw in duds in their compilations which have no business in the album. This one has at least eight of the Playboy's best, I'm not sure about the two songs ""jill"" and ""Sealed with a Kiss"". I would have preferred ""Tina"" which I consider one of their best."
3,What the heck,"OK. Gary Lewis and the Playboys were not the greatest act of the Sixties, but listening to these tunes brings back a lot of pleasant memories. Lewis really couldn't sing very well, and it's interesting to hear how they tricked up his voice to make it commercially viable. Ear candy, but what's wrong with a little sweetness in our lives?"
2,Woeful prose,"There are some bits of information here for hardcore Carlosites. But the writing is beyond bizarre. Terribly written, evidently unedited, plagued by a secondary personal narrative that begs to be skipped over, it would have been infinitely better if Gaby had followed Castaneda's dictum of erasing personal history and stuck to the topic at hand. English is evidently not her first language, grammar and spelling errors are the rule rather than the exception. The book is inadvertantly hilarious in places but does make a nice afterward or forward to Amy Wallace's more compelling and better written tell all. If you're interested in the rise and fall of Carlos and his inner circle you'll want to read FILMING CASTANEDA. Keep your expectations low and you might not be too disappointed."
4,NEW ORLEANS BLUES,"VU DU MENZ COMBINES THE PIANO PROWNESS OF HENRY BUTLER AND THE NATIONAL RESONATOR GUITAR OF COREY HARRIS WITH BOTH MEN SHARING AND ALTERNATING THE VOCALS. THOSE UNFAMILIAR WITH THE VOCALS OF HENRY BUTLER SHOULD CLICK ON ""LET 'EM ROLL"" OR CHECK OUT ONE OF BUTLERS PREVIOUS CD'S SUCH AS ""BLUES AFTER SUNSET"". PRIOR TO THIS CD THESE TWO INDIVIDUALS COLLABORATED ON A COUPLE OF TUNES ON COREY'S ""GREENS FROM THE GARDEN"" CD. APPARENTLY AT THAT TIME THEY DECIDED TO RECORD AN ENTIRE CD TOGETHER. THE RESULT IS VU DU MENZ AND THE DUO PERFORMS VERY WELL TOGETHER. BUTLERS PIANO PLAYING GIVES THIS CD AN OVERALL FAMILIAR NEW ORLEANS BLUES SOUND. THIS CD WILL APPEAL TO FANS OF DR. JOHN, PROFESSOR LONGHAIR, JAMES BOOKER, AND OTHER PIANO ORIENTED BLUES BANDS. OVERALL A GOOD EFFORT. MY ACTUAL RATING IS 4.5!"
4,A brilliant Artist comes with another winner,"This is a good album. I am a big Corey Harris fan, and although I really like this album, I didn't feel as though it was as creative as ""Greens from the Garden."" However, this album is modern acoustic blues at its best. Henry Butler's piano and voice lend a new voice to the album, and there some musically and socially powerful tracks on this album. ""King Cotton"" and ""Mulberry Row"" are incredible tracks that really carry the album along with ""Didn'y My Lord Deliver Daniel?"". Another good album from a man who you MUST see live if given the opportunity."
4,another behind the scenes hero of space exploration,"We all knew and admired the astronauts and those few managers who got public attention but a lot of the really compelling heroes of the space program were behind the scenes and not just in the government. Exceptional engineers in private industry had to figure out how to solve the daunting challenges of going to the moon and produce the actual article. There was probably no more challenging and fearsome assignment than Grumman's responsibility for building the lunar lander, a vehicle so bizarre, it required a completely new way of thinking to design. Mr. Kelly was the man who got this project and the story of how the task was turned into reality is an interesting and fascinating story for those interested in space exploration."
4,I wish I could read this book but...,"This looks like a good book but the print is so small it's giving me a headache! I hope they bring out another version with NORMAL SIZED print then I could start to enjoy it.Please tell the publishers to fix this basic ""engineering"" problem!!"
5,Essential Apollo Book,"This book is a must-read for any serious student of the Apollo program. Kelly presents an honest, readable account of the challenges and frustrations faced by Grumman engineers in designing, fabricating, testing, and flying the first lunar lander. As a manager, Kelly provides insights not only into the engineering problems of building the first flying machine of its kind, but also into the problems of getting the work organized and done.And Kelly seasons it all with the excitement he felt being part of a great adventure.This is the story behind one of the best episodes (Spider) of Tom Hanks' ""From the Earth to the Moon"" and I highly recommend it."
4,Thomas J. Kelly's insight into LM development,"I was in my late teens when I watched the first moon landings in awe.As an engineer I have been interested in the technology of the of the Apollo Programme, and the LM particularly, ever since.I must say when I ordered Thomas kelly's book I was expecting drawing schematics and technical nut and bolt (and electronic) descriptions. Consequently I was initially disapointed.However as I launched into reading it I became engrossed. - The book is about how thousands of men and women can come together, organise and work against daunting technical challenges (and timescales) to make that Giant Leap for Mankind.The book has given me some additional technical insight into the development of the LM. But more than that I now feel I know many of the people who made it happen, understand more fully their motivatation and pride in what they achieved."
3,More technical info needed,"Nearly half of this book is devoted to discussing the management systems that produced the LM. Which is fine; certainly it's well-known that the management systems developed for Apollo played a huge part in the success of the program, but I got this book hoping to learn about the nuts and bolts of the LM and its construction. There are only a handful of illustrations and little technical info about its operation.Disappointing as a book about the design and creation of the LM, but a useful addition to Apollo history."
3,Good for those for want to go past the astronaut stories,"I consider Moon Lander a worthwhile collection to my NASA collection. While not as interesting as the stories of the astronauts (e.g., Lovell's Lost Moon, Shepard & Slayton's Moon Shot) or mission control folks (Chris Kraft's Flight and Gene Kranz's Failure Is Not an Option) it does tell an important part of the story of how we got to the moon. Being an engineer, I appreciate the engineering that went into the development of the moon lander. Sometimes Kelly spends a little too much time on explaining organization charts, but when he sticks to the design, development and deployment of the space craft the book works. I also would have liked a few more illustrations and photographs. If you are looking for a book on the Apollo program this is not the one I would start with, but if you have read about the astronauts and mission control folks and want to learn about the engineers then Moon Lander is definitely worthwhile."
5,A must for people interested in Apollo and complex projects,"Kelly gives a lot of fine, technical details about the development of the lunar module. But there is more. The book is a must for project developers and project leaders dealing with complex and large technical projects. Items like your relationship with the customer, proposal politics, project management and quality aspects are widely discussed at a very pleasant way. A small minor point is the fact that in the second half of the book information is repeated a couple of times. Therefore a second printing needs a bit editorial work to correct this."
3,Good but lacking,"Well, as a reader of many books on the space program I found this book lacking. The missions portion of the books was little more than recycled from a hundred other books. The main point of the book seems to be that Grumman was always behind schedule and over budget. Ok, but not a great book"
5,Because of Winn-Dixie review,"I thought that this was a really good book. It was kinda sad and happy at the same time. I thought that it was sad because I felt kinda bad for Opal, the main character of the book, because I could never imagine not having a mother. At the same time I felt happy for her because she had found friends in the end and of course Winn-Dixe in the beginning.I would recommend this book to other people especially kids in the fourth, fifth, and sixth grade. If your were younger and you liked to read I'm sure that you would like it too. I hope that reading this book review will make you want to read it even if you have already read it before. I have."
2,Song of the trees,Disappointed with how small this book is. Took less than an hour to read. The price was right for the size of the book. I've read all the others in the series and liked them all.
3,I recomend this book for anybody that loves imagery.,"This story I have read was Song of the Trees by Mildred D. Taylor. This story was manily about a girl named Cassie, who hears the trees singing outside her bedroom window. When Mr. Anderson comes she doesn't hear them singing anymore. I give this story three stars because as I was reading the book an image kept coming to my head. For example when Cassie said ""Hello Mr.Trees"" I could picture that image in my head. The reason I didn't give it four stars is because the resolution did not end like I wanted it to. I recomend this book for anybody that likes imagery as there reading."
2,Description misleading,"We received this item in the time noted at time of purchase. The book itself was creased on the cover and it did not go through the cutting process properly. Therefore, the pages were all over the place. I needed to give this book to the library to replace the one my daughter lost. It was a difficult task substituting a substandard book. I would not order from this company again."
3,I enjoyed the author's tricks,"I give Song of the Trees 3 1/2 stars because Song of the Trees needs more pages and a better ending. That would help the book. The good things are the author's tricks. They are imagery,accents and the way they make you feel like the character."
5,Awsome Collector's Item,This double disc was purchased in Korea. Awesome tracks for the year that it came out and includes a DVD with never released on TV music videos. I strongly recommend it. The track list is shown on the other listing for this product and Amazon will not be ordering any new copies.
4,His best? Perhaps.,"To me, the most surprising thing about the album is the quality of Johnny's voice. I had no idea, until recently, that Johnny sang! The very convincing duet with Margaret Whiting in ""Baby It's Cold Outside"" displays Johnny's emotional and expressional range well. His emulation of black voices and speech patterns in his then-popular ""Ac-Cent-Tchu-Ate the Positive"" tells me that he had more than just a good set of pipes, but also an excellent ear for contemporary speech and music. What great lyricist would not? Many of the songs in this album I knew only by their lyrics-- I had never heard them performed to music. In listening to the song ""Personality"", performed with the Pied Pipers, one gets the feeling that one is listening to a live broadcast, back all those years ago. With 10 selections in all, this is a gem of an album. I only wish that EMI-Capitol Music (Johnny's own label) had included more selections. Perhaps they felt that too much of a good thing is dangerous."
4,mixed review,I was disappointed in that it did not show the insides of the personal planes of the celebrities mentioned. But it was informative on how the planes are remodeled for personal use.
5,Great Voice- but not Caruso,"I heard Corelli in his prime and these selections reflect the beautiful spinning tones with clarion high notes.One negative -despite what some might say- he was not Caruso- in La Donna Mobile, Caruso sings the cadenza with amazing ease amd brightness. Corelli sings about 1/2 the notes and his voice moves like lead- IT IS BAD and I am a Corelli fan.Corelli did have an easier high C than Caruso - but Caruso is in a league of his own. I just purchased on Amazon the complete Caruso most of which I have on vinyl. He is simply the greatest tenor in the standard Italian repetoire."
4,It was Aiight,This was Aiight. Nelly is clearly the second best to Tech N9ne in the Big MO. Tech N9ne is better. Nelly's country grammar has got songs to make him go national.
2,Disappointing new format,"I have ordered the Life Is Just So Daily calendars for years. It has always been so convenient to glance down the column of each family member and see what the week holds. This calendar mentions ""a whole new look,"" which ""has made it even easier for families to keep track of their busy schedules."" I disagree. The family members' names are now along the side, causing the user to have to write them in several times on each month's page. This is inconvenient and harder to understand at-a-glance. Luckily, I looked at the picture closely before I opened it. I will be returning this calendar and ordering the ""Make a Note Family Planner Wall Calendar."" I will miss my year of M.E. illustrations, but the format just doesn't work."
3,Well...,I don't know exactly what to think of this release.It has some good tracks on it but with a title like that you would expect it to be a collection of all of her best in the 90's. And therefore it's just too incomplete. And what are the original versions of 'Our Darkness' and 'Sleeper....' doing here ? They have been included on several other compilations already and certainly are out of place here since they're early 80's
5,Great reading,"I have been studying Buddhism and Hinduism. This book made the concept of a base consciousness given rise to the material universe very clear to me although I wish it was finished. One problem I have with the philosophy is how to resist the tendency toward Solipsism with this worldview. Chatterji asks this question then directs you to a non-existent appendix for the answer. Even with the incompleteness, I've read the book twice now and got more out of it the second time."
4,Vaan Dammme. Best Movie Since His Glory Days. I Want More!!!,I loved this movie. I almost didn't rent it. I must buy now! I've been a van damme fan since he started doing movies and I must say that this is one of his best to date.I would have like to see more action though. More body count would have been nice and more fighting specially at the end. I thought the movie ended too quickly at the end.It's nice to see him play the bad guy just like in double impact bad twin. I think he fits the profile a lot better as the villan/assasin and not as the goody to shoes good guy with a smile.Give me more evil van damme! That's right evil!!!!
3,An Ok Movie,"I work at a video store and take home movies each night (usually one), last nights selection was Wake of Death with Jean Claude Van Damme...yes it was the typical violent/revenge story, but this one was a bit different. This movie showed Van Damme's other side, a side that I have not seen before. I saw a Van Damme that was endearing to his family, and his character (Ben Archer) wanted something more than what he was doing in the past. Violence...yes...Storyline...good...overall, I think that the picture should have delved a bit more into the lives of these characters."
5,One of Heinlein's Best!,"It is refreshing to find so much accolade for one of Heinlein's novels. I find this novel to be one of my favorites of all time, including possibly my favorite Heinlein novel of all time. It was a delight to read, and had many good commentaries about today's political ideas throughout.I also found the idea of a computer that ""wakes up"" to be utterly fascinating, and the detailed description of how Mike grows and what he can and cannot do to be quite interesting - as compared to some where computers work magic. Anyone remember the magical speaking computer in WarGames? Without wires yet!I am also fascinated by Mannie's perceptions of privacy and personal responsibility. This is a very fascinating read.I still imagine that one day, I'll be able to punch MYCROFTXXX and hear ""Mannie, my best friend,...""If you liked this book, read The Cat Who Walks Through Walls. Characters aren't as much fun, but the Cat Who Walks Through Walls is still a novel not to be missed."
5,Powerful words to a growing soul,This book was an incredible journey into the depths of mankinds collective soul. Their were many powerful messages and the confusion of the books stream of concious narrative only adds to the effect. This book is what got me started on heinlein.
2,I just can't take this anymore...,"A great plot, but too many personal messages and sexist views coming through that take away from the flow of the story. My biggest complaint (and surely many other readers') is the character of Wyoh. When first introduced in the book, I thought: aha - a strong female character! Several chapters later, and my hopes were dashed into the wall yet again. Avoid this book. No, really, I'm serious."
4,The Moon could be harsher,"From the time I started reading this book I was intrigued. The story is excellent. The libertarian revolt of the moon was a novel idea that is yet to be bested. The only problem I had was the broken english that the main character kept speaking in. It did add a bit of flair to the book, but it did become cumbersome. Other than that I would recommend this read to any science fiction fan."
1,Classic reading?,"I finally got around to reading this 'Classic', and what a let down. I love Science Fiction, and I don't let the fact that it talks about outdated technology turn me off a story, but when a story is simple and the characters shallow, I have trouble taking a liking to it.Mannie gets involved in a revolution, a life changing decision, quite easily, no real intrinsic motivation there, just one meeting. The Professor seems to have all the answers and the Computer can handle everything. Really, is this the stuff of a good story?Daniel Upton explains it better than I can, so I won't repeat his comments. It's just not a good story - how did it become a Hugo-Award winner?"
3,Doesn't quite reach greatness,"This is an entertaining, thought-provoking story that explores several timeless themes of science fiction: the relationship between humanity and machines, the sentient nature of artificial intelligence and the relentless perservance of the human race against all odds. As always, Heinlein is original, imaginative and gripping. However, the book also contains some lewd sexual elements and displays poor taste on a number of occasions. The fatal flaw of this book, however, is its readability. The story is told from the first-person perspective of the main character, who has less than a mastery of the English language (for example, he frequently leaves out key words such as it, the, a/an, pronouns, helping verbs, etc). While this is part of the novel's ambiance, it makes for clumsy reading. This novel is worth your time but isn't strong enough to recommend highly."
3,Good tale turned into a rock-throwing spree,"This is a very nice, concise expression of libertarian values. Unfortunately, Heinlein's characters failed to achieve 'revolution' through their philosophy - it required a war, complete with rock-flinging catapults which I thought was bit gratuitous, a 'de rigeur' type of prop for SF novels of the time. Otherwise, the portrayal of Mike the self-aware, 'living' computer was beautiful, and brought up the question: What is life anyway? The Lunaspeak, the cultural and marital customs, and colloquial humor were entertaining. An enjoyable book but not great."
5,One of the classics,"I'm a bit shocked it has taken me this long to read this one of Heinlen's. It really is one of his best, in my humble opinion. If you are already familiar with Heinlen you probably don't need me selling this book as a good read to you. If you are not then I highly reccomend starting with this one or ""The Cat Who Walks Through Walls."" This is a great book - it is written first person by a ""Loonie"" (meaning a resident of the Moon) and he has something of an accent. Some of the grammar actually reminds me of a friend who has a Russian accent. It may take a bit to get used to this as at first it seems as if the author has reaaallly bad grammar. However, once you get used to it, it adds to the story and I found it interesting. This is a tale of revolution, politics, history and understated heroes. One of the best around."
5,TANSTAAFL!,"The story of the Lunar Colony's fight for independence and recognition as a Free State is fraught with philosophy, politics, ballistics, and computer science as well as action. It's as nearly perfect a science fiction novel as one can get, with deep and dynamic characters, a captivating story line, and enough future history to keep one up several nights running scenarios. It is unfortunate that Terra is no closer to building a Lunar Colony today than in 1966 when this was written."
5,A timeless page turner,"This book was the first book of the authors that I read and is one of the best science fiction books ever. The thing that makes this book for me is the depth the author brings to his characters, plot, and the philosophies that all mankind face and question. This book is worth the time of any serious reader weather you like sci fi or not.This book will keep you up into the wee hours of the morning to see the end. Great book."
4,Excellent SciFi.,"Might just be Heinlein's best. All about Luna's quest for freedom from Terra's Federated Nations. A futuristic David & Goliath story if ever there was one. Characters are so well developed you feel you know them, and Mike the computer is as real as his corevolutionists. The suspense, along with the action, builds continuously from beginning to the excellent ending. And not the slightest bit outdated."
4,"It's like a sandwich, only with a rotten middle of meat.","The 1st and last parts of the book were classic Heinlein, but the middle became too much of a boring lecture. Dumb, but very important."
3,"Not Bad, not Mr. Heinlein's best though...","The Moon is indeed a Harsh Mistress ! I realize that now, after having finished this book. I'm sorry to say it was a little too predictable. Hopefully without spoiling the fun for future readers - everything went so easily - this future ""American Revolution"" as it actually was - like changing channels on the TV. However, I've got to hand it to Mr. Heinlein, he's was a very good sci-fi author. Probably the best . The Books about Lazarus Long are more than just books, they're ...You Name It !!!!"
5,The Master at his best!,"I actually wore a black arm band to work on the day he died.I worked in the tool crib at Lockheed and EVERYONE knew whyI wore that band. Hard working, country westeren listening,machinist, and they KNEW! R.A.H. is the master and it is un-canny how, as old as this novel is, up to date it is. Cavernsof the moon, I hope they are there, just waiting for us tofarm them. Elbow room for the disenchanted of Earth. It doesnot take newbees to si-fi long to find the Master of si-fi.R.A.H. follows up on this book somewhat in other novels, Thecat who walked through walls, I think...If your copy is gettingsomewhat dog eared, put it up in a safe place and buy this book.The jacket art alone is worth it."
3,Meh,Too smug for my liking. Heinlein always seems to have one character who is way smarter than everyone else and loves to remind you of that. Over and over. In this case it was the Professor. The book spends way too much time telling you something then how they arrived at that something then why that something is better that your something. In spite of all that it was a compelling tale but I would have cut out about a hundred pages.
4,First Heinlein Book for Me,"This was my first Heinlein book and I really enjoyed it. I found it fun and interesting and at times funny. The thing I hated, and it's mentioned in other reviews, is the way it's written. It's written in the way that the narrator of the book talks, and it was not something I was able to overcome and fully understand in some cases. I found the story exciting to the point that it made me want to create my own Baker Street Irregulars and lead my own Independent Moon movement. Some say that this is Heinlein's best work, but I personally liked ""Starship Troopers"" better, but, hey, that's just me. I'd still recommend the book."
4,Well written if somewhat dated...,"Although originally written in the 60's, this book was still interesting to read even in 2004. Obviously, some of the technology seems a little out dated - but the book is mostly about politics, and politics never really change."
5,One of my favorites,"Others have said pretty much all that needs to be said, but I've read pretty much everything Heinlein has written, and this is definitely amoung my favorites."
1,problems with order,"initially received correct book, wrong style. Ordered hard cover, received paperback. Returned book toseller 2 weeks ago and requested a hard cover copy. Have not received replacement."
3,"I have to admit, I was disappointed!","After reading all the incredibly positive reviews here, I thought this book would be fabulous. Well, it may be a classic of science fiction but unfortunately it's very dated and more of a political statement than a sci-fi book.It's essentially a book of endless pages about how a revolution is set up (but only if you have an omniscent computer running your entire society). Even if I had been looking for a book on how to stage a revolution, I don't think I'd find much of use here. There is an engaging story in here, but it's bloated with endless detail on the underground revolution.Technologically, it's really outdated. I guess that's not surprising in old sci-fi, but I couldn't accept a humongous, unmoveable computer as part of a near future.But, if my 2 complaints aren't likely to bother you, you'll probably like it."
2,A boring piece of ...,"Mike was likable, Wyoh was tolerable, but Mannie was an annoying fool. The book went into irrelevant and booooring mathematical descriptions, went overboard on characters and the way characters left out words like ""a"" and ""the"" was annoying"
2,"Some interesting ideas, bad story","Heinlein's book is considered a classic of sci-fi. It shouldn't be. His interesting libertarian and sociological ideas notwithstanding, the book has flat characters and a predictable plot. Everything goes wonderfully for the freedom fighters from start to finish, and the villains are bumbling idiots who never understand who they are up against. The good guys are too good, unwavering, and simple. The bad guys are too stupid and incompetent.I kept wishing the plot or the characters would turn into something interesting. They didn't. Sadly, this book suffers from the malady that separates science fiction from literature or even good fiction: substituting a fascinating view of the future for good writing."
4,"Really good, but not his best","Thought of by many as his most important, if not best novel, ""The Moon Is A Harsh Mistess"" is thoroughly enjoyable and (I hate to use the cliche) one of those books you can't put down. But it lacked real insight into human relationships, something Heinlein displayed a great knack for in ""Stranger In A Strange Land."" If you're looking for your first Heinlein novel, read ""Stranger,"" then read ""Moon."""
2,"Interesting concept, not so interesting execution.","I found the plot creative and interesting and was really excited to get into it (as I love politics and dystopian novels), but I am not a fan of the execution. For me, this book was very interesting in the beginning, climaxed around the middle, dragged on for the second half of the book, and finished in disappointing fashion. The first half of the book felt entirely too rushed and the second half of the book felt entirely too drawn out. The narrator's broken English became quite annoying about a third of the way into the book, as well.Some parts I found very interesting (certainly creative) and kept me reading, as they were either exciting or had outcomes I didn't expect, but as a whole the book was slow and disappointing."
5,"Before you dismiss Sci-Fi, READ THIS BOOK !","I'm a big RAH fan and I've read many of his works. While I may not have enjoyed this _story_ as much as I enjoyed some of the others, the concepts and philosphical viewpoints that RAH builds into the story make for a compelling read. Have a friend who dismiss all Sci-Fi as mindless pap? Buy them the paperback and challenge them to read it and not find it as thoughful and thought provoking as any nonfiction work on the market. Better yet, give them your old torn and faded copy and go buy the hardback; this is one you will want on your self for some time to come."
4,Great election year reading,"TANSTAAFL--words to remember in this election year or any year. In science, science fiction or politics, the ultimate truism--There Ain't No Such Thing As A Free Lunch--provides the theme for this wonderful book, Heinlein's best that I have read.For those interested in real science fiction and the politics of individual responsibility/worth, this book is required reading.This is the story of men and women who, through their duty to themselves, had greatness thrust upon them. In addition to being a first-rate adventure, this book leads the reader to great insights on AI and technology's general relationship with individual freedom. Having said that, the reader never has the feeling of being bogged down in syrupy fantasy. This is a real book about real people (and real Dinkum Thinkums!)Recommended for readers of all ages, especially those who haven't enjoyed SF before."
5,Heinlein's absolute best!,"This book is the epitome of the freedom for which Heinlein has always stood. It does not have any ""Marxist sentiments"" (Spider Robinson, there's a new candidate for the most ridiculous attack on Heinlein), it is a book which details the meaning of freedom, and at the same time a hard-SF adventure yarn as good as Red Planet and Farmer in the Sky. If you don't like his ""lectures,"" you don't have to read the book. But from what I've seen of the attacks on Heinlein by Panshin, Aldiss, Disch, and others, they don't just want to avoid Heinlein's work. They want his writings removed from the body of SF literature forever. P.S. What's the difference between a fascist and a liberal? The fascist suppresses you in a military uniform, the liberal does it in tie-dyes."
5,Heinlein's Best,"In my opinion, this is not only Robert Heinlein's best book, but (or perhaps therefore) it's also one of the best of all time. The sentient supercomputer Mike works with Manuel, his technician, toward Lunar independence. Amid the intriguing politics and innovative rebel tactics, readers will get a healthy dose of comedy as Mike stumbles along the way to sapience. Buy this book and read it. You'll love it."
1,Noooooooooooo!,Where's the freaking Kindle version of this - Heinlein's best book? Where? Garbage like I Will Fear No Evil has a Kindle version. I'm trying to replace as many of my paper books as possible with electronic copies and I would love to have this - one of my favorite books of all time - in my collection. What do we have to do to get it?
1,"Tells, Doesn't Show","I know this is a classic bit of science fiction writing by one of the masters, but I hated it. I don't read much SciFi and now I know why: I just don't get it. I found this to be a very, very longwinded and boring political screed. Heinlein tells the story but doesn't show us any of it. Showing is what makes fiction fiction and great writers great. But hey, what do I know. Heinlein is a master, or so they say. Just don't do like I did and take it as a beach read, comrad, because then you're bound to be disappointed."
1,Dreck,"I've now read Heinlein's 2 ""greatest"" books, The Moon is a Harsh Mistress and Stranger in a Strange Land.Heinlein is a truly terrible writer, I honestly don't know how he is so highly rated and praised. I really tried to give him a chance but his writing style is like reading a book for tweens. It is broken and disjointed, for all of you out there who like him, my hats off to you but for myself I will not read another Heinlein novel."
1,BORING!!!,After I heard so much of this book I thought I had to read it. But it was a big disappointment! The book is BORING! I think in the sixties it was funny but no more today! I hate this book! Heinlein wrote better works such as 'Stranger...'and 'Puppets...' or 'Double Star'.
4,Portable DVD Player,"I had been looking for a PDVD player for a long time and this one was great, it was cheap, but high quality, buy it"
4,A Thorough History of DFW,"This book tells mostly about the history of the Dallas-Ft Worth area and it's aviation roots. The book explains the building and operation of one of the largest aiports in the world. This is a good book, but more could be said of the current operations."
3,"Interesting, but not outstanding.","The book has an interesting premise. But it jumps around in time a lot at the beginning without any clear transition, so it's a little tough to follow. There's never any (or very little) description of how old the people are after the time jumps, either. But by far the most annoying thing is the names of the characters. Clones of a particular person all share, for example, ""B"" names. This might be considered ""cute"" in the real world - aww, look, little Johnny and Joseph and Jeremy and Jesse playing together. It makes for very annoying reading, though, and it's never clear who the F is talking. After a while I just gave up and didn't bother to try to understand who was speaking. The ""story"" is interesting enough that you can do that. It could have been written much better, though."
5,Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang,"In 1976 Kate Wilhelm wrote a science-fiction masterpiece that still delivers a powerful message to today's audience. This book details the end of our society in an incredibly prophetic voice. What works best about this novel, is the touching struggle of the three main characters as they fight to survive and to hold on to their own humanity."
5,One of My Favorites!,"Science fiction isn't really always about science. The best sci-fi is about humanity, and a futuristic or technological bent allows the author to explore particular aspects of humankind.Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang is that kind of great science fiction, focusing on humans in a sci-fi setting. The book is about cloning, more or less. But actually, the themes run far deeper than a mere op/ed piece on a technological possibility. Cloning is used as the vehicle to explore the meaning of individuality, the uniqueness of a person, and the consequences of complete homogeneity.If you like hard edge technological sci-fi, this book isn't for you. But if you're looking for excellent fiction that happens to be in the genre, I'd give this book a hearty recommendation."
4,is cloning human beings consider a good idea ?,"long befor the sheep ""doly"" kate wilhelm visioned the cloning of humen being, in her books she try to prove that cloning will not do any good to the development of the humen race, on the cterary it will bring it to an end. kate wilhelm thinks that only the darvinistic aproatch is the suitable way to human develoment and try to prove it in this imaginative novell.for conclusion, classic book from the 70's witch only lack, is the in continius time leaps, between time periods, so it looks like couple of short stories were woven together to one plot."
1,I can't give it a 0 star rating,"The Character of Mitchell is a dimwitted lush who couldn't save this nonexistant stinker from stinking as badly as it does. However the MST3K version of this movie makes even the Linda Evans sex scene almost bearable... IF YOU'RE watching this one straight ( not Mystery Science Theatre Version), then get really drunk and sloppy so you can be like Mitchell....."
1,"Ahhh, Mitchell!","This is one of those movies that, after watching them, makes you think of all the other things you could have done with your time.Fortunately, I was lucky enough to watch the MST3K version, and I was saved by a barrage of witty remarks by Joel Hodgson, Tom Servo, and Crow T. Robot.Anyway, Joe Don Baker is arguably the star of this disgusting spectacle, featuring a 25 mph car chase and some of the ugliest outfits you've ever seen. The fact that this was originally meant to be a serious movie makes me shudder."
3,Mittens?,"This review is for MST3K folks. For people who enjoy Joe Don Baker, you may enjoy this for other reasons. The bad is it is bare bones. Not that I really cared for much in terms of extras. But it is the movie and that is it, not even a menu here. For this price tho, to see the movie in it's full glory, it is worth it. There was alittle more blood, some mild language and JDB looking at a Playboy that were the things that stood out to me as different than the MST3K episode."
1,All I can say is well .........,Mitchell was hillarious on Mystery Science Theatre becuase of how much slamming it received. Other than that it was tough to follow & a really bad story line. I don't even know why Linda Evans was in it. It was really really really boring. Walking Tall was so much better!
1,A cynical release,"MitchellI cannot recommend this dvd.For starters, the picture quality is abominable. It's almost an insult to the buyer.Secondly, Reel Enterprises have cut a lot in this film.In the original version we can see how sexually active Miss Evans is, even to the point where she gives head.But I guess that later on Miss Evans regretted her spontaneity and applied to the courts for an injunction against these sexually explicit scenes. Succesfully, I might add.I feel I've been had.Verdict: a cynical release."
1,No NON,"Monotonic dribble. This is definatly the ... NON release so far, asides ""Might"". I can only recommend NON's ""God and Beast"" or ""Easy listening to the Iron Youth"". If you are looking for a good noise, look for titles from Merzbow, Painjerk, Deathpile, Whitehouse, Masonna and others. NON is way too over-rated."
2,Uninspired,"This is one of NON's least essential albums by a longshot. ""Receive the Flame"" is a monotonous and boring record except for tracks such as the wonderful `Solitude' and the dynamic `Spectre'. Some Non fans considered this album as a masterful return to form after ""God & Beast"" but the truth is that said album is much better than `Receive the Flame'. The only works by Non which are really worth checking are ""Blood & Flame""; his latest instalment ""Children of the Black Sun""; the compilation ""The Best of Non"", and the aforementioned ""God & Beast"". ""Receive the Flame"" is only destined for his die-hard fans and not for the casual or objective listener. Buy the single `Solitude' instead."

4,good product,"very light, easy to use, sharp. I have only had for a few months, so am holding off on the 5-star rating until I see how it holds up over time. Love the extendable handles, they really help reach things that are difficult even while on a ladder."
5,sharp and very functional,This is a very useful and well designed product. Light in weight and very sharp cutting edges. I prefer the accuracy of this to electric clippers.
5,So far so good,"Makes hedge trimming so easy. Super sharp and easy to use. Similar to a brand we buy at our County Fair, and every bit as good."
5,Tougher than I expected,"When I purchased these shears, their light weight was a plus but really worried me concerning durability. Sure, they eventually broke. But they only broke after years of abuse and while attempting to cut something far above its grade. I'm absolutely buying them again."
4,JJ's review,"i thought this book was good,because i like baseball and it had some suprises that I didnt think would happen.I THINK YOU SHOULD READ THIS BOOK!It is a short book but it is still really good for being a short book. I didnt want to leave my book after I started reading it. If you get a cfhance to read this book, do it you will be amazed. Hope you enjoy the book."
5,Classic UK Jump Blues R&B Band Back With A Vengance,The Big Town Playboys are back... This new album swings and shuffles like crazy.. With a whole new lineup except for founding member bass player Ian Jennings... Great production and sound.. Many different blues styles and great songs can be found on this new recording just to keep things fresh... If you like to dance this cd will keep you moving!!!!!!!!!
5,"Rica Matsumoto - ""Destiny"" album","This album contains both fast rock and roll songs and slow ballad type songs. They are sung in Japanese with a mixture of English words in the lyrics. Hits played on the radio include ""Rain"" and ""Freeway"". I liked it because the fast songs had a very good beat to them and the ballads were very relaxing to listen to."
5,Great Book,"I have read it 3 times as a kid. I got a copy on my 10th birthday. Great story - Buy it for kids under 13-14 Years old. Clean, easy read."
5,The best emcee out of No limit period!,"Standout tracks: EMPIRE, MEMORIES, MURDA MURDA KILL KILL, CALLIN ME, TANK DOGS, SLOW YA ROLL, WE DONT LOVE EM, WHOAA, CAN I BALL(Soulja Slim RIP), MEET ME AT THE HOTEL, PARANOID, BEEF, MONEY GETS, BOSS CHICK etc, Filler: Camoflauge Love is boring as hell but thats it. Bottom Line: Mac was one the dopest emcees from the south. Living proof that the south has great rappers. Unfortunately he gets caught up in the system and is serving hard time. It kills me when such talented rappers like Mac get locked up. The game is filled with fools with deals while lyrical geniuses are locked up for bulls--t. DAMN! Get this album along with his other album WORLD WAR 3. Not a dissapointment."
2,Overrated and over appreciated!,"This album gets 2 stars because there might only be two good songs on this overly hyped cd. It has the same old bass heavy and plain beats from producers beats by the pound, while master p keeps screaming on almost every song, its hard to take a nice cruise with that racket pumping out your car stereo. Save your money and get Mac's world war 3 instead. There's a reason why the World War 3 album is more expensive. Duh, because its way better!"
4,Mac-Shell Shocked,"Mac's got a cool voice, and a tight delivery, and even if he's from No Limit, if you just listened to him you'd never know that he was. Just about all of the No Limit soldiers of '98 appear on this album Master P, Silkk The Shocker, Snoop Dogg, C-Murder, Mr.Serv-On, Big Ed, Fiend, Mystikal, Soulja Slim, Kane & Abel,2-4-1, Magic & Mia X. Plus his sister Storm is on a couple tracks.The best songs on here are ""My Brother"" which is my personal favorite, ""We Don't Love Em"", ""Soldier Party"" ,""Wooo"" which is the posse cut on the album. ""Boss Chick"" ""Callin' Me"" ""Meet Me At The Hotel"" ""Can I Ball"" & ""Beef"". Its a real tight album and you gotta get it whether u like No Limit or not."
3,It was okay,"I buy all no limit albums as often as I can. Mac is tight but tracks 10, 6, 2 and 8 bailed him out from becoming an album disaster."
5,IT'S JUST GOOD!,"SHELL SHOCKED IS ONE OF THE BEST NO LIMIT CD'S P HAS BEEN DOING HIS JOB!! ALSO THE SONG ALL OUR SOLDIERS IS ONE OF THE REALIST,IT'S A TIGHT SONG AND I DON'T THINK THE EXPLICIT LYRICS HAVE ANY THING TO DO WITH IT IT EXPRESSES THE SONGS BETTER"
2,"Cheaper, But Not As Good","I purchased this bottle of oil to try something different over the ""Mustapha's"" brand. However, the product appears to be MORE expensive (but has lower shipping) but it is NOT as good. It is cheaply packaged and doesn't taste as nice and nutty as does the Mustapha's brand. This one tastes oily and has less of a scent than the other."
2,The smell is overpowering.,"Argan oil is often mixed with other oils to create commercial and personal products that are great for skin, hair and nails. Had I known of this oil's almost nauseatingly heavy scent, I wouldn't have purchased it. I've since mixed it with several less fragrant (including unscented mineral, vitamin A & E)oils but it seems to have made no difference.I cannot comment on its use in flavoring foods as I didn't purchase it for that purpose. The merchant I purchased this from earned a 5-star review--my feelings about the product aren't their responsibility."
4,Great early reader,"All of the ""Rookie Read-About Science"" books are great early readers for children. They enjoy being able to read the more difficult words and learn about the animals, etc., at the same time. This series was recommended to me by our children's librarian to interest my oldest son in reading. But I think all children would enjoy them."
3,For information only!,"If you are looking for knitting lace patterns, you will find very few in this book, which you can be find in any other compilation of knitting stitch pattern. It is mainly picture of other people works and history information."
4,Old Favorites,"This CD, has some good songs that everyone loves, and some you may not have heard. A good CD for all the old time country fans."
2,not that great,I bought a few wine wheels for a viticulture class I was taking for my culinary degree. These wheels left something to be desired.
4,"Good movie, but deviates significantly from the book","I really enjoyed this movie. It was my first Minnie Driver movie and is the one that I always think of when I think of Minnie. Charming movie. I was thinking about it so much that I read the book this weekend. I was seriously disappointed by how much the movie deviated from the book. Different ending and different path to critical moments in the book. I'm kind of disappointed that it deviated so much from the book, but enjoyed them both immensely."
4,"Good Movie, Great Book","This is a very enjoyable movie with lots of familiar faces. The reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is the book tells the story better. Benny becomes a much stronger character in the book, and has some additional revelations about her worth and value.The movie hits on most of the highlights of the book. This is for all those gals who have ever been slightly awkward or overweight-- there is more to life than just your looks."
1,Circle of Friends,"I loved the book. But the movie deviated so far from the plot line that it was quite a disappointment. If you enjoy finding redemption and reconciliation in movies, this one isn't for you."
2,The book's better,"If you love the book PLEASE don't watch the film! Minnie's great, but Chris isn't as good as usual. We needed a great Irish actor!"
1,Yuuch!,"This is an incredibly sappy movie which I would never rent or buy. It is not even worth wasting two hours of your day. The plot is weak, the characters aren't interesting, and the actors are not good at all. If you want to be bored out of your skull this is the movie for you."
3,Don't read the book before you see the movie,"I read the novel by ""Maeve Binchy"" back 6 years ago, and I can still remember how the plot was, and how beautiful everything seems to be. Unlike reading it, when I watched the movie, it was so disappointing. Minnie Driver could've done better than THAT! O'Donnell was great, but the plotting in the movie was very flat and you just felt like falling into sleep. Then again, the book is always better than the movie. One thing that I like most from the movie, though, was because they changed the ending. I felt after what everything Benny had been through, she deserves happiness, especially when Jack apologized."
1,Never received,"I ordered this item on February 16th through Amazon which was sent to a place called graywhale_entertainment. I never received this item and there doesn't seem to be any way to inquire about this on the Amazon site. This is the first time this has happened to me, but has made me very wary of ordering through anyone other than Amazon for fulfilling my request."
1,Did not focus on the book,This movie strayed from the book. At least five characters were left out and there was no focus on the town or the upbringing of the two (what were supposed to be) main characters. After reading the book I was curious to see the movie. How such a great and interesting story could come up so bland is puzzling. Half the book was about the town of Knockglen and the personalities that live there. That whole part is left out of the movie. The movie barely touched on more than two chapters. Very disappointing. If you read the book do not see the movie.
2,what a disappointment.,"i recently read and very much enjoyed maeve binchy's ""circle of friends"". i was anxious to rent the movie to put faces with the characters and also to share the story with my husband. i was sorely disappointed at how much detail was taken away from this wonderful story. many of the ""friends"" were eliminated completely, characters were re-created or diluted and subplots rubbed out, decreasing the credibility of many elements of the story. even the ending was replaced with a more liberal point of view (which contradicts the 1950s irish catholic morals in the book). my condolences to the author for the loss of what was a captivating story."
2,A Circle of Friends - Read the Book,"After reading and thoroughly enjoying Circle of Friends by Maeve Binchy, I bought the DVD. I was very disappointed. The only word I can think of is ""fluffy."" In the book, the characters and their situations were developed, so that I could really empathize with them, especially Eve. In the movie, none of Eve's spirit and hurt comes through at all, nor did Nan's desperate desire for a better life, or the fact that she was actually a very good friend to Bennie (Bernadette)in the beginning. However, Minnie Driver did an excellent job in the lead role, and she alone earned the two stars I gave this movie.I did enjoy seeing Ireland. I think the Irish music was a bit much, actually taking away from the mood of the movie (if there was a mood to begin with). It felt like a Lucky Charms commercial. I would have liked less music, more story detail.I do not recommend this movie, but I highly recommend the book."
3,Read the BOOK,"Yes, it is a very good movie, but the book is so much better. It has a way better ending. I suggest first reading the book, it is so much better."
4,One of The Best Movies I've Ever Seen!,"Wonderfully enchanting story of unlikly love, and heartbreak. Benny is an 18 year old College student being pursued by a much older employee of her father's business, Sean. Benny meets a heavenly man named Jack, he's hunk to say the least. He takes a liking to her, and they start dating. See is this love ends in marriage or in a gutter. Or if Benny finally falls for Sean. Wonderful movie yet it doesn't compare to the book. The book is about friends and isn't all in Benny's point of view."
2,Hmmmm,"It's not an everyone movie, those who have been cheated on can really feel the pain that the characters in this movie causes. An those you haven't, you'll wish that you will never feel this way. Other than that, it's full of forgiveness and starting over."
5,Minnie Driver is wonderful!,"One of my top-ten favorite movies and my favorite romantic comedy. In order for a romantic comedy to work for me, I have to be able to fall in love with the girl. When I first saw Minnie Driver on the screen, I thought: ""No way!"" But Benny won me over and is my favorite romantic comedy character. How can such a plain, frumpy looking girl radiate such incredible beauty with her smile and character? I am happy to see Minnie Driver has gone on to a modest degree of success and an Academy Award nomination. She has certainly earned it but Benny is still her best character. I highly recommend this movie to romantic comedy fans. There are some serious issues involved in this movie and they are handled very well. The ending is perfect and took me by pleasant suprise."
5,Passion # 3 helps you keep on going deeper,the Road to One Day not only helped me prepare for a conference but helped me go deeper with the Lord. I am so exicted about Passion and the heart behind thier organization they truly have a heart to worship and take you with them. Get them all and they will draw you closer to the father. I would rate Passion as one of the top worship bands in the world at the present time. I only pray that they keep seeking the Lord and following in His direction.
5,A worshipper from Boulder,"The Road to One Day is an absolutely incredible CD. I think it is their best album yet, and I can't wait for the One Day event in May!"
4,Party Song,"I heard this song all through-out Oktoberfest in Munich/Munchen 2008. And this is the original version, which seems a bit hard to find. High energy and fun, definitely something to add to your driving playlist.The disc has several versions. I didn't really notice a difference in them."
1,Dimensions???,How do you expect someone to purchase this item if they don't know its dimensions....please get with the program!!!
3,funny but yet... let down (mild spoilers),This is a very funny series. Assuming one can see past all of the fan service. The fan service is almost overwhelming and at times very blunt and hard to see around. There isn't much for a story basses. Its overly short with out getting much done. As well as the romance that was big in the manga seems to almost fall to the way side here. Not enough put into it. A battle every episode and repeat explications wear one thin and dreading the next battle. One saving grace that this series is a small bat that appears from time to time with something half way witty to say. Manga is much better (but which one isn't better than its T.V./movie counterpart?). Buy for a good quick laugh. But not much else.
5,Fun and Enjoyable!,I was a bit torn between the reviews but I went ahead and bought the first season. I finished it today and found it funny and enjoyable. It may not be for die hard anime fans but it was fun and upbeat. If your looking for some bubble gum to watch over and over this is a great choice. I already ordered season 2. Lots of fan service and some harsh language but nothing that takes away from the show. Not for the kids but cool for any older teens or adults.
4,Strongest monster and only human. . .,"I like the 2-sided characters that share their mind, but have different perceptions and different viewpoints.So. . .your dad stumbles onto a school acceptance letter (after being at the bar) to some school after you've been rejected to all other schools after doing no research or knowing anything about the school. Wouldn't you kicked the kid out of the house too? On the flipside, wouldn't you want to attend a school like that?"
4,Review and a Vampire,"This anime took me by surprise. I will admit that it uses the same old formula seen in other anime series...especially Harem anime. Now I happen to like some of the Harem anime. Tenchi Muyo was one of the first anime series I watched. But that's besides the point. Rosario + Vampire is about a human going to an academy meant for monsters; Monsters such as Vampires, Succubi, Witches, etc. Humans aren't accepted in the academy and humans can't even get to the academy because of a special barrier that surrounds it. Of course, Tsunkune Aono--a human--ends up going to the academy and makes some friends who are all monsters and who are all girls......and of course they want to get in his pants. None of the characters are deep. As I continued to watch the anime, I started to like it more and more. The climax to the first season was brilliant as was the ending to the second season. Is it perfect? I'd say no. But I did like it. I didn't read the magna so I can't say which is better."
4,Great computer for the price,"I bought this computer in Aug. 07 and love it. It was slow until I uninstalled some of the software that I don't use that came along with it; i.e. games that you have to purchase and products from Google that I didn't care for. It is mobile enough to take along on a flight to watch a DVD (which we did). The DVD controls are located on the left side of the keyboard and handy to use. It came with Windows Vista Premium and is very easy to understand and use. The one time I had to phone Toshiba about a question, I actually spoke to a real person. Since purchasing this laptop, I rarely use our desktop computer. I was a bit nervous about installing the wireless internet, but mine came with a free router (D-Link) and I was able to set it up myself. I mainly use this computer for e-mails and internet use. The reason I purchased Toshiba (other than the great price) was that it rated extremely well in Consumer Reports."
4,Great value for money,"The laptop is very nice and seems to be working perfectly. Considering the low price, it's definitely worth it!"
5,Laptop Review,"Very good computer and excellent price, processor speed is fast and overall a great package."
5,Very good Laptop at a very good price,"I bougth this laptop because I think Toshiba ia a brand to wokr hard in laptops and I'm rigth with this laptop.If you want to work hard and have a high movility, this is a very good choice at a very good price."
2,Disappointed,"I bought a older version of this computer a year ago. I had the computer one month and the hard drive crashed. I sent it back to the company and three weeks later they returned it, fixed (not to bad. The computer served its purpose for me for some time but it never ran at 100% since day one. The disappointing part wasn't the lap top itself, it was the service I recieved from Toshiba. They are very slow in resolving problems for you. I needed to order a new battery and power source for it, three months later I still have not recieved the parts. I am very upset about this and I can honestly say I will never by another Toshiba product again."
4,first laptop,i purchased this for my birthday and put quite a bit of research into it... that is as much as a technophobe can. i'm really pleased with it and only hope that i used all of its features. the only draw back is the battery life is pretty poor.
4,Good Laptop for a College Student,"This is a perfect laptop for a college student (doing web browsing and wanting to type research papers). However, with only 1GB of RAM this isn't going to be your extreme gaming system as Windows Vista uses about 600+MB just to run the OS. Yes, Vista is slow. Other than that, the battery life is about 2.5 hours (not great but not bad). Good laptop for the college student."
3,Memory issues,"I picked up one of these guys in a brick-and-mortar store, but ended up returning it within a few hours. The problem: the laptop comes with 1GB memory (2GB max), and the 1GB consists of 2 512MB DIMM's. So if you want to max it out (and you do, if you want to run Vista), that means you'll need to buy two 1GB DIMMs and throw away the two 512MB DIMMs that came with the system. That's too lame for words, so back to the store it went."
1,worsest laptop I have ever had,"I am a programmer,I have many laptops, three HP, one Dell and this one.I bot a A135-s2246 about two years ago, it was cheap, it worked fine for about 10 month and then the LCD went black screen, it was within the warranty, so they fixed it for me, and one month ago, the computer suddenly went blank screen again, and I have no idea what caused it. checked LCD,hard drive,memory, all good, but it just stopped working."
1,Terrible Laptop DO NOT BUY TOSHIBA,"WHen i first bought the laptop, it worked fine. Then, the sound card went to i had to take it to best buy to get the whole motherboard replaced. This was in the first 4 months of owning it. 2 months later, the whole hard drive goes, so i lose everything + i have to get it sent out for 2-4 weeks. Best Buy was able to recover some of the data, but not all. Also, the wireless card sucks so i have to restart the computer every time i want to use Internet Explorer (i suggest using Safari for Windows, it doesn't have the same problems with the wireless card). Finally, it is the slowest computer i have ever used! it only came with .5 gb of ram, and needs at least 1 to run properly with vista. DO NOT BUY TOSHIBA"
4,Good for the price,"Good product for the price. Only had trouble with a DOS based program, but of course those are about out of date, so it was to be expected. As for speed, it's ok. Only thing I didn't like was that it had 2 512MB DIMM's and I thougt it was 1 1GB, so the expansion I bought only brought it up to 1.5GB"
3,"Good specs, but fan is noisy","I bought this laptop a few weeks ago for [...],which was a good value. It works fine, but my two complaints are the fan noisy and the ram (2x512 sticks rather than 1GB stick, makes expansion wasteful/more costly). I'm not so concerned with the ram, since I don't require any high end processing, but with the fan, even though I use it mostly for browsing the web and watching videos online, the fan seems to turn on and off frequently (on 10-30 seconds, off for about a minute), after using it for a period of time (30 minutes to an hour). It's very noticeable and distracting. Is it supposed to be like that? Does anyone else have this issue? Any suggestions regarding making the fan quieter, or turn on and off less frequently would be appreciated, if you can leave a comment. Thanks!"
1,"Disappointed "" hot buy""","I ordered this product in June, hoping to receive a fast, stable computer. In stead, what I got was a big disappointment. The graphic driver did not function correctly, Vista is confusing, keypad is slow to respond, I called the TOSHIBA technical support number more than 10 times within 3 days of receiving the laptop!!! And the TOSHIBA support line is a wast of time. There is only one guy competent enough to help me immediately. All other ""technicians"" asked me to wait before giving be instructions. When I asked them more questions, they asked me to wait more!! Worst of all, No one could help me to change the language setting. I finally figure it out by meself.Anyhow, It was a disaster. I returned the product after too many frustrations. The graphic driver still did not function correctly before I return it."
1,Vista and Toshiba are a bad match,"I am always skeptical with these inexpensive laptops and this time I should have been more so. The lap top has been in the shop more than out and the technicians keep claiming that Vista is not working right with the equipment. Who knows? The vaunted media capabilities of vista don't work with it. Leaving you with a pretty useless machine. By the time you purchase the necessary additional software to get what you need to make the machine even marginally useful (word processing and spreadsheets), you are at the price of a basic Mac. The Mac is like your television, you open the box and it works. All of these windows based computers would be like receiving your television without the remote and then having to purchase that seperately and then program it in. Would you ever buy such a TV? Then why buy one of these?"
1,Bad news.,I bought this Toshiba laptop for my daughter to use at college. During the 1st semester it had a problem but was repaired by techs that the college provided. Then 3 months past the waranty the hard drive goes bad. This has been a problematic computer and I will not buy another Toshiba.
3,"Heavy, but bright and sturdy",Definitely consider for home desktop replacement. Sturdy - but heavy - huge bright screen. Good buy
2,i get what i paid for,"I needed the adapter to extend my micro HDMI from 6ft to 16ft but the pic is horribly bad or turns black, might just be that i got a defective one, idk ...... i am not returning it because i would spend more in gas then i would have maybe gotten back.It did arrive fast , no complain about the shipping or seller"
2,Did not work for me,"In two different use cases the computer noticed a monitor was connected, and even detected its resolution, but the picture was always black. Defective or misdesigned? Or am I just using it wrong? I really don't know. I guess I never will."
2,50/50,"I bought a few of these HDMI couplers, and some worked and some didn't. They were inexpensive, but still I expect the product to perform the function I bough it for. I tested a multitude of cables and connectors just to make sure they were the fault and they were. I had some that would not carry the audio and some that would not carry the video and one that would carry neither. So i'm glad I bought a few extra but I really was not too thrilled with being their quality assurance inspector. Buy at your own risk and if you do, throw in some extras just in case."
4,Works,"I have a projector and unfortunately a 25 foot HDMI wasn't going to do it. I had a 15 feet HDMI cable lying around in one of my baskets and I decided to use it. I mean I cannot complain about this coupler. It works great. If there are any problems with the signal I really believe that it is my 25 foot HDMI cable because I did hide it under the carpet as well as put a lot of pressure on the cable. But it works great. However I am not sure if it will work with 3D as I have never tried. But it does do its job. The fit is really tight so once you connect the two HDMI cables you will have a secure connection, no problem. Just be sure you get decent HDMI cables. WORKS!"
4,Great and Inexpensive,Works really well. Much less expensive than what can be purchased at the store. Used it to mate two HDMI cables for my laptop to the tv and it works great.
1,Worthless product,I would be more upset if I add invest more that a couple of dollars in this. It doesn't work. Luckily I have a 15 ft. HDMI cable to solve the issue.
5,just what i expected,"Received it in about 3 days, hooked it up to my existing HDMI cable, and everything worked fine. When connecting, it makes a nice assuring 'click' sound. Didn't notice any loss in picture quality. Not sure about sound because i put it on the end of a DVI to HDMI cable, and DVI doesn't transfer sound, but so far so good!"
1,Seller Doesn't Send the Described Item,"Seller didn't send the correct described item. If I order a symmetric HDMI coupler, I must receive a symmetric coupler not an asymmetric coupler. What you have sent me doesn't work with my application. Seller is LowerPriceUSA."
1,did not work,"got the connector, hooked it up to extend my hdmi cable to another, and there was no signal going to the tv. checked it without the connector and worked fine."
3,Pricey.,Must say I was underwhelmed by the product. I could have purchased the same or similar product elsewhere for $1.99. This bag was not what I expected for the money. Sigh...
4,Cute and Interesting,"I got the Black, White and Red bag, its very nice and sturdy. I wanted to use it as a lunch bag but it may be too big. It is a metallic plastic, made of 93% recycled material, I was expecting a fabric but that makes sense. Its cute and looks like it could carry a lot of weight. I really do like it."
1,What a Joke,Can you just see Mrs. Romney on a bag like this. Never!! She has too much class to do something silly like this.
5,Mighty Michelle!!,"I loved this design so much I bought two bags, one to use and one to keep for later! Love the design and really appreciate how much thought goes into a ""Blue Q"" - and how much of it is made of recycled material! Feel good using it and look great too! It was actually bigger than I expected it to be, very roomy and well thought out."
2,Match of the century fizzles out.,"This book is better than some but never quite makes it up to the level of the earlier ones. I have to agree with the last reviewer in that disaster characterizes many of Farley's plot lines. I mean, Alec is in his early to mid 20s and has already been through a shipwreak, several plane crashes, and a forest fire. It's a pity that the author had to torture his characters just to come up with stories. ""The Black Stallion and Flame"" is another medicore work that boasts an workable plot that is far from spectacular. Also the Black and Flame start acting out of character which is extremely frustrating. The Flame and the Black that I know from Farley's earlier books would have died trying to kill each other. Not so in this book. In fact they seem to make up and be friends. Overall not very memorable."
2,Should be called Black Stallion meets Dracula,"I found this to be one of the worst Black Stallion stories ever published. I have been a fan of Walter Farley's horse stories since the early sixties and I agree with many other reviewers that most of them center upon some horrible accident. Another problem is that Alec never seems to age, he's always a ""boy"". I would not recommend this book."
3,A bit too much of a departure,"I have all the Black Stallion books through The Black Stallion and the Girl, and this seems more of a departure than the two books on his harness-racing son, Bonfire. It begins with a plane crash that separates The Black, mares and foals from Henry and Alex who manage to land on the island where The Island Stallion reigns with his herd. While I won't go into the plot of the book, I found that, interesting as it was, it just couldn't come close to the racing world we are used to. No Napolean, no Satan, no Mr. and Mrs. Ramsay for the most part, and no Hopeful Farm. The story did highlight the strong bond between Alex and The Black which was the best part for me. I had a hard time swallowing the idea of two wild stallions racing after a bat, though. It was more exciting in The Black Stallion Challenged when he and Flame battled on a racetrack instead of an island."
3,"French Soap Opera,1840's Style","Again,I saw the movie before reading the book. Warning;book is very different and I liked the movie's ending better. Cousin Bette is like the cousin from hell. It's interesting to see how she is either directly or indirectly responsible for everyone's mis-fortune (Talk about passive-agressive!) However, The constant stream of charactors was hard to follow at times. Actually,a fun read overall and I learned alot about French politcs of that time. Just don't get the version with the painting of the woman reading a book on it's cover unless you don't mind rather stilted tranlations (as I found this one to be at times.)"
4,"Different, but interesting.","I found this novel long,but well worth reading. You learna lot about different people's personalities in it. I wasinteresting."
4,"tragic, nevertheless human comedy indeed.","Seriously and fatanstically flawed characters---jealousy, lust/addiction, greed, and vengeance--generated and fed by the culture as the significant supporting character and the frailty never stops. A great social commentary and a sad one for our human nature."
3,A little too complicated,"Having read and enjoyed Eugenie Grandet and Old Goriot, I was anxious to read Cousin Bette. Overall, I did enjoy it but there were aspects that I did not find believable such as Baron Hulot and Crevel, one an accomplished government man and the other a sharp, wealthy businessman, falling so blindingly in love with Madame Marneffe,the slut of the story, almost at first sight and to the extent that they completely ignored every clue that she was cheating on both of them with yet another (Baron Hulot's son-in-law) while being married to yet another. Also, I wonder if Parisian women of the time were really as accepting of their husbands having mistresses as was Adeline. It seemed to me that the story would have been just as good if there had been one or two fewer romantic involvements and it certainly would have been easier to follow. As for the title of the book, Lisbeth Fischer (Cousin Bette) is not the main character by any means; neither was Eugenie in Eugenie Grandet."
3,Gift,"My husband is beginning his train town, this item was ok, the only thing was it did not include the needed wiring, I don't recall it stating that the wiring was not included. All other simular products included basic wiring"
3,FINALLY! REAL MUSIC! ...SEE? FANTASTIC R&B SINGING IS NOT DEAD YET!,Cool sampler of two very outstanding R&B; albums.And keep this in mind before you buy:IT IS A SAMPLER OF BOTH ALBUMS! FIVE SONGS FROM THE WHISPERS AND FIVE SONGS FROM MAZE.You don't get both albums in their entirety....Cool?..Cool!..Now let's dance!
1,Waste of time and money,Consider watching destination truth instead at least the host is funny. This seemed more of a home movie horrible choice.
1,Horrible,Waste of money. This was an absolute disaster with no redeeming value. Amazon should pull this video series. I would rate this zero if I could.
3,Paranormal or not,"This collection of ""activity"" was difficult to see. You have to replay scenes over and over to really see what is being explained. The sound quality isn't any better. At full volume, sounds were not clear. Not something I would recommend my friends to watch."
2,Bearing Problems/Replacement Cutterhead Cost,"Purchased the G1033X in March of 08 and in February of 09 had to replace the bearings for the cutterhead. Talked to Grizzly and because under warranty, they sent new ones. It was definitely not an easy replacement. January 10 had to replace bearings again. Before purchasing this planer, beware of the cost of the replacement carbide inserts. They are $62.95 per 10 pack. I need to replace all, as I have used all 4 sides, and it will cost me roughly $650 to do so! Grizzly offers no volume discount on carbide inserts. Whether you buy 10 or 1000, the cost is still $6.30 each. It is almost cheaper to replace the cutterhead with a Byrd (certainly cheaper in the long-run). When I talked to Grizzly, they said ""That's why not many people purchase this planer..."". If I had to do it over again, I would have purchased a standard 4 knife planer and upgraded to the Byrd spiral cutterhead. It would have been MUCH cheaper."
4,Not bad,"I own a couple other Lithuanian books and while this one's layout is certainly not atricious, it's not the best. They make a concerted effort for the reader to understand the words and to be able to replicate them accurately, but it gets to the point where even the last sound file goes so slowly and painfully that I at least was ripping my hair out. Nevertheless, I was incredibly grateful for the sound, the presentation, and the fact that while it did need to be supplemented, it complemented all of my other books (Beginner's Lithuanian, in particular). And indeed, I'm very pleased with it so far."
2,Maybe if you already know Lithuanian,"This was a huge disappointment. Because it comes with CDs, I expected it to be a CD-based course - one that would include the opportunity to listen to vocabulary words and conversations and repeat them. No such luck. Instead, the book chapters begin with a list of vocabulary words followed by conversations. The CDs just repeat the conversations in Lithuanian. You have to go back to the vocabulary lists in the book to translate them. I don't know how you can learn from that if you don't already know the language. The CDs begin with the alphabet and the pronunciation of various letters, which is slightly better than useless. I'm really shocked at the positive reviews this has gotten. If you're a flat-out beginner, look elsewhere."
2,Left something to be desired,"This book was a light read. The authors had a really good story line going and the plot had real potential. I liked the characters and was very interested in their conflict, however towards the end the story seemed rushed. The authors took a lot of time setting everything up and introducing us to the characters. The story leading up to the climax was very well written and kept me wondering what was going to happen next, but it disappointed me. It just seemed like they spent all this time on the book and then got tired of it so they finished it off real quick. It was, however, an ejoyable read.-indifferent"
2,Very disappointing,"This book had 3 major things wrong with it. First, the 2 main characters from the other Full books were nothing but minor characters in this book. There were so many characters in this book, that none of them had any depth and were all superficially written. Second, the 2 lead characters had so little interaction that you had no idea why they were attacted to each other. When they got together, the reader feels like she somehow skipped 50 or so pages. Third, the ending was rushed and a huge letdown. Evanovich did the same thing in Ten Big Ones. She used up her allotted pages and tied up all the loose ends in the last chapter. I think Janet Evanovich is trying to churn out too many books and the quality has really dropped in the last few years. Skip this book and save the money."
1,disappointing...,"This book lacked the chemistry between the characters that all the other Evanovich books have. It left much to be desired and is a disappointing sequel in the otherwise AMAZING ""Full"" series."
5,LOVE IT! LOVE IT! LOVE IT!,"I am a huge Janet Evanovich fan, but in the past year or so I have been a little disappointed with her books. I still enjoy reading them, but they haven't had the humor and flair that I've gotten so used to. BUT, in Full Bloom she is back in full force. This is one of the funniest, romantic, laugh-out-loud murder mystery books I have read in a long time.It picks up with a new character, Annie Fortenberry, but brings in all of the other characters from the ""Full"" series. Annie runs a bed and breakfast in an old bordello and she rents rooms to a couple of women. Her husband left her for another woman and she has shut love out of her life. Until Wes Bridges shows up and wants to rent a room. But she has to work love in around being a murder suspect, planning a wedding for her friends (Max & Jamie from previous novels), running her bed and breakfast, and chasing down the drunk handyman.I highly recommend this book! Love it! Love it! Love it!"
2,Only if you're desperate for something to read...,"Very disappointing compared to other books linked to Evanovich. The plot seems inconsistent. So much time is spent on showing a character's personality only to have them do something completely unbelievable and out of character. Suddenly, in the middle of the book, the cat develops some need to just play dead, which I believe was meant to be an attempt at some funny, but was just plain creepy. I think Evanovich just threw her name on the book to help her friend Charlotte sell more; there is very little that is written in the Evanovich style."
2,Trying way too hard...,"I am a big fan of Janet Evanovich and the quirky individuls that populate her books but this one tries way too hard to be goofy and cute and ultimately fails at both. There are too many and they are all way too eccentric - it would have worked better if they had taken the silliness down a notch or two. And the romance between the main characters was totally unbelievable. About half way through I skimply skipped to the end to see ""whodunnit"" and tossed it into my ""books to give away"" pile."
5,Pure Evanovich,"As a diehard fan of dear Stephanie Plum and a Moretti woman myself (in my dreams), these books (all 5) are a fun read. I read them all back to back and enjoyed them completely. Although Evanivich is a ""light"" writer...you won't learn a whole lot in her books, this series is a great, fun escape. The only detraction in her writing is a very similar, gun toting Grandma Mazur character who keeps resurfacing, albiet with different names. I say keep Grandma with Stephanie and stop pigeon-holing all older females."
2,The bloom has wilted,"I was really beginning to enjoy this series of books until the writers decided to drop the main characters and story line. Just when I was getting to know Jamie and Max and their mad group of crazy friends and family everything changes. What happened? Did they get tired of Jamie and Max? What could have been an enjoyable extension of their last book left me just plain wondering....It would have been fun to see how Jamie and Max coped with a murder investigation in the midst of their big wedding plans and Dee Dee's baby's arrival, but instead they were just kind of stuck in as an afterthought. I don't know about other readers, but I get invested in the protagonists I look for books that continue with those same characters so I can watch them grow. What could have been the next Nick and Nora Charles series is now, for me, a sad goodbye."
2,Maybe someone else liked it,I tried her other books because Plum's were so wonderful. I just couldn't get into them like the Plum's
1,I didn't want to finish this book,Nothing in this book made me want to keep reading. I never cared what happened. Sorry Janet Evanovich fans but this book will soon be forgotten.
3,Full Bloom,"I liked the book find, but not as well as others that i've read. She has a great sense of hurmor."
5,Full Bloom,"again this was not for me but my mom she a big fan of this other, her books are cheap her the our books store so i get them online for her."
5,Romance and Fun In One Book,"Janet Evanovich once again gives us a wonderfully romantic story in FULL BLOOM. as with all the books this author writes, her work is tight and the story unfolds in ups and downs that keep you wanting to know more. She is a superb author that i just can't say enough wonderful things about.Other books to look for in this genre:Back To The Bedroom by Janet Evanovich andFire In The Ice by Katlyn Stewart"
1,Sagging Bloom,"The authors kept my interest with the frolicking escapades of Annie, Wes, Destiny, Doc, and company, in the anticipation of a somewhat thought-out, acceptable conclusion. Not so. At the climax of the story, when the reader would expect the characters to ""grow up"" and the story to come together, it just goes from insane to ridiculous. Extremely disappointing. Would not recommend this book at all. It is outrageous slapstick, without the humor."
1,I need more Stephanie Plum Mysteries,"I absolutely love the Stephanie Plum books by Janet Evanovich! I quickly read all of them and wanted more! Then I found the ""Full"" series, including this volume, ""Full Bloom"". I was really disappointed to find that this is just an average romance, not very well-written. The humor, which just flows in the Plum novels, is very strained. A better choice for Stephanie Plum fans who are waiting for the next installment might be ""Bubbles in Trouble"" or any of the ""Bubbles"" books."
3,"Loved the story but,",I really liked this book but had trouble getting past the reader's sorry attempt to do voices most were like nails on a chalkboard.
5,Lorelei King can bring anything to life,I have listened to the Stephanie Plum's series read by Lorelei King and enjoyed them and didn't think it would be any different with this audio. I love her characters and how she is able to distinguish them all. As for the story I was truly surprised at the end. Great story.
5,My Thirty Years' War,This is an honest tirade on the inner state of the artistic intellect and sensibility. Anderson is a publisher of a zone-smashing literary review in the early 1900s. She speaks to us as if from today's world.
4,"Good rebound form ""Henhouse""","After an uncharacteristic weak album with ""Trouble at the Henhouse"" they have rebounded and released a solid CD. Something On, Membership really grab you and smack you in the face, and the last two songs ""Escape is at Hand"" and ""Emporer Penguin"" are excellent slower songs to cap off the CD, characteristic of 1991's Road Apples. If you are a Hip fan, get it, if you want to sample the best of the Hip, I recommend starting with Fully Completely or Up to Here."
2,This album has TH one good song Poets,This is the album that actually has one good song on it hence the 2 stars. Every other album is just a mix of messy bland attempts as music with the dying goat vocals.
2,Rock?..or not.,Ew...The Hip is starting to become lame and generic...Sure Poets is the best Hip song in years but is was written years ago. With that in consideration you have to wonder what they are thinking with this. The Hip rocks when they rock but this attempt was far too lame for a rock fan. Lyrically sound but who gives a rat's a$$...Hip rocked they do no more.
4,Diverse and Driving...,"Phantom Power is the most diverse Hip release yet. With Don Smith at the helm for the strongest tunes on the album, the sonic quality of Up To Here finally meets up with the psychotic purpose of Gord Downie's words. Poets really kicks the album off on a strong note...with Johnny Fay providing a strong groove. And the beauty of the hip is that I never know what Gord is talking about..."
3,THIS CD IS DISAPPOINTING.,"ALTHOUGH I HAVE DISCOVERED THIS BAND RECENTLY ON THE REBOUND FROM A LONG TAWDRY LOVE AFFAIR WITH REM , I CAN'T CONDONE THEIR TRITE, OVER-SENSITIVE LYRICS WHICH SOMETIMES SMATTER OF EARLY YES OR RUSH. THEIR VOCAL AND INSTRUMENTAL ABILITY IS BEAUTIFUL AND CREATIVE. THEY PICK UP THE PIECES WHERE R.E.M. CRUMBLED FROM STIPE SELF ABSORBTION."
1,POETS DRAWS YOU INTO MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT!,"Listening to Poets is very distracting from the rest of the songs. It's an absolute classic rock song. However, as I listened to the rest, I was totally disappointed and bored out of my mind. If you like Poets and haven't heard any of the other songs on this album, don't expect anything even nearly as good. I bought this album, listened to it a couple of times and returned it to the store. Listen to it before you decide to buy it."
1,Let me explain,"Ive only given them 1 star because Im afraid that if more people find out about them in the States, I wont be able to see their amazing live shows in small venues any longer. This is a really great band that puts out superb after superb CD. I didn't think they would be able to top ""henhouse"", but they have. All told, one of the best unsung bands of the 90's."
3,Watered-down Whiskey,"I was very disappointed after listening to this release. Not because of the band's performance, which was superb as usual, but because it's essentially a re-release of the ""Live at the Whiskey"" CD, minus some tracks, and the remaining ones re-sequenced. There are no liner notes, and nothing on the container indicating that the disc contains previously released material. If you're looking for some terrific performances on the essential tracks, and you're on a budget, this is the disc for you. Otherwise, it's worth spending a few extra bucks for the original."
1,Burn the tapes!,"The short of it: Just hated, I mean HATED this album. The Band had no reason to be togather at this point. Any other Kansas album is a far cry better than this one! Move on."
1,Disappointing at Best,"In conducting my own sociological research and as a former female Marine, I eagerly sought out this book, hoping for real information about the current status and experiences of women in the U.S. military. What I found, however, was 370 pages of self-serving diary-type brooding, anecdotal ""evidence"" of rampant sexual predation by military males, and almost NO voices of the military women themselves. This book is disappointing at best. I found myself appalled by many things Ms. Solaro asserted and alternately laughing at other things that were simply preposterous. I suppose this book could be useful to give someone an extremely subjective view of women in the contemporary military; however, readers BEWARE that this is written by a journalist! Although, Ms. Solaro alludes to her credentialed education, I see very little evidence of an acceptable methodology nor support for her extrapolated conclusions. Readers should take this book with a heavy dose of skepticism."
1,Unsatisfying assessment of a complex issue,"This short book does not do justice to the extremely complicated issue of women and their potential role as frontline combat soldiers. Instead, it consists of a rather simplistic personal journal of the author's press-sponsored visits to Iraq and Afganistan. The author continuously esposes her leftist/feminist idealogies unfortunately without any attempt to establish an objective and defendible framework for any form of scientificly defensible analysis. There are far better and much more relevant books on this subject that are readily available and which are much more readible and which provide far better insight and illumination."
5,The Wanderer-The Fourth Kensho book,"I loved these books, with a mix of martial arts, Zen philosophy, and mind powers with a scientific explanation, these books are ones I wished I had written. The charecterization is well done and I liked, hated and understood the motivation of each charecter. Well worth reading especially if you like books with scifi and martial arts combined."
4,Upper P Mystery,"Nothing like a good murder mystery in the Upper P to start the season off. The only thing I really did not like was that the paperback I had, had very small print."
3,Not a holiday mystery,"In the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, a wealthy and politically powerful man is found dead in a campsite. He died of a heart attack after a bear attacked his tent. Deputy Sheriff Steve Martinez notices a trail of bacon fat leading to the tent and wonders if this was actually murder. He investigates.The locale of the Upper Peninsula is well portrayed in this well written but routine character driven crime drama. The book is packaged as a Christmas tale and this is really misleading. Parts of the book take place during that time of year but the holiday plays no significant role in the story."
4,Fun-Filled-Reading,"The book was packed with very informative stats and items pertaining to the life and career of my hero and yours, Derek Jeter."
5,Soul Ballet Vibe Cinema,"This CD was made for me! It is modern and fresh, yet smooth and sexy- just perfect.Each song is in total harmonie with the next and still new to the ear.A Shear pleasure to listen to!It has a permanent place in my changer and even the worst traffic-jam in L.A. has become bearable, thanks to the magic of Soul Ballet.This is the best CD I have bought in a long time."
2,TV-B-Gone: needs improvement,This product idea is fantastic and I hope Cornfield Electronics makes an improved version. I returned this device because it would not turn off the advertising televisions at Wal-Mart (whose IR sensors are clearly visible) no matter how close and direct the TV-B-Gone's line of sight. It can work--it did turn off my home television from five feet away after about 60 seconds--but the range probably needs to be improved before this will be useful in public places.
1,"Great Idea, But a Piece of Crap","What a great idea. I've been annoyed by TVs in public places for a long time. Too bad it's a worthless piece of crap.In testing it on my own TV at home, it was unable to affect the TV when anything was in the way- so I couldnt turn it off with it in the pocket of my pants or jacket. Second, it wont turn off the TV unless it's directly facing the TV, and finally, you have to be directly in front of the TV. That's right - there's no way to be surreptitious about it - you need to stand directly in front of the TV, extend your arm with the TV-B-Gone in it towards the TV, and hold down the button for 60 seconds. Then you get to answer questions about why you turned off a TV in a public place. Nice.And that's IF it works. I went to the doctor's office yesterday and was 5 feet from a TV showing some awful show, and no matter what I tried, the TV would not turn off.It's a pgreat idea, but a piece of crap. Dont buy it."
1,doesnt work on newer brand tv's,"buyer beware, this product needs an update to work on newer brand tv's. just returned mine looking for additional items that have the same results."
3,Not Exactly As Advertised.,"It works well enough...if you're standing a ruler apart from the actual T.V. Its exciting at first until you realize that the signal strength on it is pretty terrible. You have to be really close to the T.V. and you can't even turn it off unless you're pointing at it directly in a special angle. Its especially a pain in the butt if there are lots of people around because its extremely apparent from the size of the remote what you are doing. I'm slightly disappointed with its performance, especially in its variety of T.V.'s that it actually cannot turn off is more vast than realized. There are very few models of T.V.'s being produced these days that can be shut off with this remote. Most public T.V.s have a shut-off proof wiring. Definitely not worth the money. I think they need to create an updated version of the T.V.-B Gone."
2,"I wanted to love it, but it almost never worked","I was often able to get the TV-B-Gone to work on televisions in people's homes. It works on my own TV, on my parent's, and it also worked in a couple hotel rooms I tried it on.However, I had purchased it hoping that I could turn off televisions in restaurants, bars, and other public places. Unfortunately I could not get it to work *even once* in those places. I don't know if the bars/restaurants have caught on and protected their TVs from these gag toys, whether I couldn't get close enough to a TV hanging from the ceiling in a restaurant, or what, but every time I tried, with hope and excitement, to get it to work in public, it would not.I got the TV-B-Gone about 4 months ago, and have tried it multiple times in public places; also tried moving closer to the TVs; but have only ever gotten it to work on TVs in people's homes or hotels. Sorry!"
3,"Works, but a little slow, underpowered","This item works as advertised, but it is a bit slow (it can take up to 60 seconds to fire off the right code depending on the TV you're pointing it at), and a little underpowered (you have to be sure to point it directly at the TV for it to work)."
4,Works...but wish infrared went through glass,Works as advertised...but unfortunate that infrared doesn't work through glass...would be great to turn off the tv from outside the house.
2,Not as strong as i hoped,"it works fine when you are in the room and are close up, but it does NOT work through windows, i tryed pranking my friend by shutting his tv off through the window (which is only 10 ft away from the tv) and it wouldnt work... so if your looking to have fun with this product you might be dissapointed.."
2,Flaws,"Fun product, but a useless housing. Had to superglue it together to keep the chain attached. Not sure how I will change the battery. Good way to have people just order another."
4,Works great,"This product works great and on almost all the TVs I used it on! The only con is that you have to be very close to the TV for it to work. Also, I am sad to know this does not work on LG TVs and Dell TVs."
3,Cheap Housing,"Works very well! I bought this to turn off displays in certain places where they are an annoyance, especially in the mall's food court. No more advertising machines next to my table!Giving this a 3/5 stars because the plastic housing is cheap and has lots of holes."
2,I wish I could give this a better review,"I love having one of these, and when it works, it is great. It only works on some TV's.Worse, it is not sturdy enough to go on a keychain and live in a pocket. I've had a few break on me and won't buy anymore."
3,take a minute or so,"This does work but it can take a minute or so. As long as you keep it pointed at the TV, it'll turn it off. I kept finding myself in waiting rooms where I was alone and the TV was at full volume. Well, no one else there to watch it, off it goes. This saved me a lot of headaches.As long as the button is pressed, this will run so if you keep it in your pocket or in a full bag, you will often find the batteries run down. You can buy replacement batteries at any Radio Shack or similar, and with a small screwdriver, it only takes a minute."
4,tv be gone,"this was the second one i bought. they don't last long but they are a lot of fun to use anywhere there is a tv, bars, restaurants, doctors offices, walmart, etc."
1,"Awsome concept, Poor functionality","I was overjoyed to find this device as an xmas stocking stuffer for my girlfriend, who despises indiscriminate TV exposure. Unfortunately the device only seems to work on about 1 out of 15 televisions."
4,Postmodern rifs,"While this novel portrays exotic behavior and Key West fish guiding (talk about redundancy), murder, crime, it is not really a comic novel, a crime novel or even that elusive genre - the ""Keys Novel."" Maybe it can be classified as an ""Old Hippie"" novel; certainly there is a touch of that, but there is also a touch of the ""Old Florida"" novel with eccentric, elderly relatives with cash and the political fix. The tale progresses in a halucinatory mix of events. Simply stated young conch wants to get into the guide business, faces dual problems of not enough room for more guides and cost of boat, from which conflict flows. There are some nice scenes of excess in passion and alcohol. There is also the desperate, ends of the earth, behavior of island inhabitants: in this case people do what they say they will do, which can be a very bad thing. What plot there is can best be described as ecclectic. Read it and remember the eighties."
3,"Almost scorching, sometimes","I've always had somewhat mixed feelings about McGuane. He's obviously a talented stylist with a sharp moral eye who's capable of creating rich, nuanced characters. But something about his style just rubs me the wrong way. It's hard to describe, almost like an intentionally odd cadence, as if a born poet found himself forced to write prose.In any case, this is probably the best of the handful of McGuane books I've read. The depiction of steamy, sultry Key West is strong, as is the elemental conflict that bubbles up between Skelton and Dance (those names are indicative of the annoyingly precious tendency of this author's work). The story ends in a satisfactory - if not entirely satisfying - manner.Bottom line: McGuane is a novelist worth taking seriously but on some levels he is apt to turn off as many readers as he turns on. With that disclaimer out of the way, fans of esoteric fiction might want to give this one a try."
4,A good one to bring along on a trip to the Keys........,"I haven't read a whole lot else of Mcguane's material ,but having spent a some time in the region described, I feel that he has captured a sense of the harsh allure of the ""back country"" of the Florida Bay mangroves, as well as the rugged eccentricity of the old-time Key West ""Conchs"" and resident/refugees from other parts of the country. I'm not sure that I ever really grasped why it so important to the protagonist to become a bone-fishing guide that he would risk death at the hands of a comptetitor, but he seemed to be controlled by Destiny in a manner reminiscent of a hero of a classical Greek tragedy. I'd call it a good beach book, but anybody who has been to the Keys knows that the beach activity is a bit limited. Find yourself a nice courtyard patio or take a trip to Bahia Honda, cover yourself with sunscreen, and go to it."
1,"Poor, start to finish","Other reviewers gave this book a very positive review. I found it to be poor on all dimensions. I would have put this book in the trash after the first chapter, if I had not been on a day long airline trip with nothing else to read. While the author offers some interesting desriptions, most are poor at best. As far as plot, suspense, etc... I found none. If the author is trying to convey some point, I did not see it. Books such as this push me back to reading classics and contemporary works by well known authors."
2,Ammendment,"My previous review has haunted me as being too negative. The things I said before, I stand by. They irritate me and might irritate you. But, on the postive side, McGuane shows flashes of descriptive power when he isn't trying to be sarcastic or satirical. You COULD become a fishing guide in the Key West coastline just using this book as a bible. And while some of his prose begins with great epigrammatic flash, they tend to fizzle into vagueness...still, the power of some of his sentences is there. I'd bet McGuane became a much better writer than this book would indicate if he gave up trying to be the great American smart-ass that mars much of this book. Sorry I wasn't more balanced in my first review."
2,Unfortunate A1A roadkill,"Once upon a time, I'll wager this book was brilliant. That time has past. There are strokes of intelligence-- deft turns of phrase, bull's-eye accurate description, razor-tongued social commentary-- but all-in-all, the value of this book lies in its being a 1970s time capsule."
2,Nothing frightening here folks!,"If you are looking for spook to the bone kind of story, this is not it. It takes about 100 or so pages until something happens. And normally that completely fine however this book is a very short, about 280 pages. Unfortunately, this book, though a short read, does not leave much to the imagination and is very predicatable. Though this book should be described more as a psychological thriller, the ""People of the dark"" within the book are not explored enough to be feared/chilled by the reader. The synopsis of the book gives more chills than the actual book itself. And moreso, The People of the Dark is more sad than frightening which is unfortunate..."
3,on the radio (2000),can someone please tell me how i can get on the radio (2000)i want the remix that play on music choice channel not any of the other thank you very much.
3,Stop learning you start losing.,We currently live in the information age. I order to just stay current you must be aware of a wide rage of information. This book teaches process of how you can accelerate your learning. That way you are not just keeping up you are leading the pack.
2,Inspired Dizzy Nonsense,"I first read superlearning in 1984 and have had a look at this recent publication. As a teenager, it did inspire me to wonder about my own mind's potential. It also gave me some good excuses not to study so much, and some great excuses for why I didn't do so well in exams etc.The one thing I kind of like about it, is that it talks about many different tricks. It is an exploration of methods, and really doesn't give enough away about any particular method. I have read other similar books that give detailed steps that seem tailored to leading you off an examination cliff.The way it is written is unbelievable, and since maturing and learning about real learning strategies, I realize this book is mostly harmless.If you want something more workable, go for Kenneth Higbee instead.Browse through it at a library somewhere."
5,Classic book on memory,"This book provides a wealth of important information from areas as diverse as health, visualizations, reincarnation, and memory. I am writing this review to set the record straight because of the previous negative reviews. I have used the specific Superlearning course and I can verify it DOES WORK (and does take practice and patience). However, this is only the small tip of a very large iceberg, of the available information contained in this book. This book can lead you into many different pathways of learning such as, Artificial Reincarnation ... ., hypnosis, autogenics, yoga, and health. I recommend readers do some research and check the reference section in this book. They would venture in areas that are scientific, mind expanding, and do lead in many different directions of, which might be suitable to the specific person in general. If you do not believe me just read the book."
3,It satisfies the need but not too good,I feel this cable helps in using your LCD as SVGA monitor and HDMI output but the thikness of the cable makes it difficult to adjust on the wall if your LCD is mounted on the wall.Flip side is that it is a strong thick cable that will keep it protected from damages.
3,These cables are listed as PRO Series... What does that mean?,"I use these cables for my karaoke setup to run from a VGA splitter to a second (singers) monitor on stage. The cables work as advertised and I have no complaint about that. However they are not as flexible as I expected a ""Pro Series"" cable would be. I am not unhappy with the way they work, I just expected something with a different ""feel""."
1,sloppy craftmenship,The cable works fine but it is twisted inside the plastic tube. Seems to be sloppy production.
2,My New PC doesn't use this cable,"I'm sure the cable is good but my old PC died just after I ordered this cable. My new PC doesn't use this cable, so I returned it as soon as it was delivered.I'd certainly try this company again.Too bad I wasn't able to use it."
5,Love love love love love,The metal is a bit on the weak side. But a colander with cherries when you are doing your kitchen in cherries! Who cares!
2,Historical Romance set in 1694,"Not my favourite time period. The author makes reference to a beggar asking for 5 pounds, a rather large fortune in those days. The descriptions of the conditions in the fleet prison were a little too graphic for my tastes. In fact I gave up after the first 70 pages.From the back of the hardback:MARRIAGE RITESPAULINE BENTLEYESSEX 1694Laura Stanton could lose Fairfield Manor on her grandfather&#65533;s death &#65533; and he was dying. In sheer desperation she undertook a Fleet marriage with a prisoner, Matthew Thorne, only to find her simple plan was fraught with problems. Her grandfather Unexpectedly rallied, and her &#65533;marriage&#65533; had to seem real. But Matthew had his own demons to fight, and answers to find, before he could think about any future with Laura. Once he had his ship back, be would he off to sea, and Laura wouldn&#65533;t leave Fairfield..."
4,"Good read, can't wait for the movie","I have yet to see this movie, but the book was definitely good. It gave you the story of this movie, while leaving a lot to the imagination, at least until you see the movie. A good read, but I'm not sure the 6.99 I paid was worth the size of the book."
1,"This is Moonraker, not original stuff.","Yes, I know they already made a film of ""Moonraker"" which had basically nothing to do with the book, so they're free to use plot elements. But it's almost shameless to use this many plot elements. A space weapon (only it's called ""Icarus"" instead of ""Moonraker""), a ""zero-to-hero"" public persona for the villain (as well as his being honored by the Queen and not at all what he seems), the villain's blonde secretary who's a double (British S.S. and his secretary), a showdown at a club...I could go on and on. Why waste $$$ on this novelization when you could pick up Ian Fleming's original ""Moonraker"" at a library or used book store? It's much better, plus you get to see a ""Bond Girl"" who thinks he's stupid (at least at first, but then SHE dumps HIM). How rare is that!?"
3,"He thinks Israel is doing ""occupation"". Another christian backing up palestinians.","I haven't like a tone of this book. It started with a good chronology, but the main point of it that Israel has to ask forgiveness for living on a land where Jews lived before.He is not justifiying any side, but the author is not understanding, that by not standing on Israel's side, he looks like another Christian that accuses jews of ""Zyonism"".Just don't forget that Israel is a land where Jews lived and they have to live where they lived before they were chastised and forced to leave their beloved land. We jews are looking up to these people and jews in the whole world will be praying for Israel."
4,The Paistine-Israel Conflict,"Good quick summary of history. Necessarily limited for its brevity, but a useful primer. Reasonably balanced."
4,"Not Perfect, But Still Very Good","Despite a weak and unconvincing argument about the origin of the Israelis, and despite glossing over some important pieces of history (which, in fairness was intended since this was designed to be a compact history), this is absolutely and umistakably the clearest and fairest treatment of this subject I have read. While I believe the authors could have better chosen the areas to abbreviate since some key moments of the history of the region are left decidedly unclear, they did an excellent job of covering the history in about 200 pages."
4,"A balanced, accessible primer on the conflict","This is an excellent primer, covering everything from scholarship about the Biblical and pre-Biblical settlement of the Levant, to the Al-Aqsa intifada.The style of the book is accessible and non-academic -- a change when compared with most books on the Middle East -- but not ""cutesy"" in the style of Dummies or Idiot's books. A high school student should not have a problem reading this book, but some other readers might find the definitions and asides jarring (like the one explaining a ""Pyrrhic victory"").If you're interested in what you see in the news, or wonder about the reasons for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, get this book.However, if you believe that God gave either side a deed to the land, or that the promises of the Ottoman or British empires should be enforced in blood, you might be disappointed."
5,Hands Down One of THE BEST Authors and BEST Series EVER,"God has given Liz Curtis Higgs a VERY SPECIAL GIFT to write books. She is a natural. Not only did I get lost in her historical fiction for hours but MY HUSBAND laughed and cried with me as well, knowing how much the stories meant to me as I read them.'Thorn in My Heart', 'Fair is the Rose', and 'Whence Came a Prince' are Biblically based and they are real. The reader experiences BEAUTIFUL, RAW, GOD GIVEN EMOTIONS while reading them. You cry, you hurt, you love, you inflate, you deflate, you heal, and you love some more.Whatever you do, if you are a woman who is forever searching for worthy Christian fiction, PLEASE DO NOT PASS THIS SERIES (or any of Liz Curtis Higgs books) BY. Buy the books and let them bless you!"
2,"MY LOVE CAN CHANGE HIM....YEAH, RIGHT.","400 pages of boo-hoo-ing between 2 one-dimensional sisters and a weak, manipulative male love interest. Yuck. Jamie really does love Leana. He just doesn't know it. So he abuses her with cold behavior and verbal abuse for 300 pages! But wait, he is able to climb into the marital bed and impregnate her within 7 days! And poor, poor, Leana. She just loves Jamie with all her heart and is willing to endure all manner of humiliation. Her love is enough to change him and the world! When Jamie realizes she's carrying her son, well, he will finally realize how much he loves her. Oh Please! This is a harlequin romance dressed up in a fancy cover and hardback binding. There are no surprises in this one at all. As romance novels go, I suppose this one is fine. But wait for paperback, please."
4,THORN IN MY HEART,"I ENJOYED THE BOOK. THIS BOOK GIVES THE A POINT OF VIEW FROM SCOTTISH HISTORY AND A TIME BEFORE JESUS; WHEN SUPERSITITON WAS PREVALENT AND TIED TO CHRISTIAN BELIEFS. THE STORY LINE WAS WONDERFUL. BE PREPARED THIS BOOK IS FICTIONAL. IT GIVES SOME POSSBILITIES OF HOW RACHAEL AND LEAH FELT WITH JACOB. THIS BOOK IS FOR ENJOYMENT ONLY. IF YOU WANT TRUE FACTS OF JACOB, LEAH AND RACHAEL'S STORY. READ YOUR BIBLE!!!!! READ ONE BOOK AND YOU WILL WANT TO SEE HOW ALL FOUR END; THORN IN MY HEART; FAIR IS THE ROSE' WHENCE THE PRINCE CAME, AND GRACE IN THINE EYES"
5,Thorn in my heart,"Excellent book! I felt it started out a tad slow, but I ended up really enjoying the book and just got the second one in this series on my kindle. I now want to find this story in the bible to read also."
5,Thorn in My Heart by Liz Curtis Higgs Ebook,"Downloaded this ebook from Amazon. This is the first book in a three part series. It is the Bible story of Jacob, Leah & Rachel, done in Scotsland 1800 times. I read it in 4 days, couldn't put the book down, it captures you that much! Even though I know the ending to this story, the author captures you right in the time period of Scotsland and you are right there with those characters. Will need to download the other 2 books really soon."
5,Great Read!!! Loved it!,I just wanted to say that I thought this was a great book and very heart wrenching~ It's amazing and inspirational to see the strength and courage in the charecter Leana. All of the charecters are developed very well and the setting is wonderful. Liz definitely did her homework! Her writing is so descriptive that you feel you are living right alongside the charecters in 17th century Scotland~ I had no problems understanding the addition of Scottish words- using the context you are easily able to pick-up the meanings...Wonderful read- Can't wait for Whence comes a Prince!
1,Mega Boring,"I agree with the reader who could only get through 1/3 of the book. I made it to 1/4 and felt as though I was hard pressed to get that far. I skimmed the rest of the book and was grateful I chose not to read it. None of the characters seem to have any redeeming qualities. The Christian values one might expect from a Christian novel are completely lacking. Not one character seems to be of strong moral fiber. I felt as though the whole purpose of the book was to describe the beauties of Scotland and encourage readers to disregard personal values, if the end goal was reached. Lying, cheating, adultery and over descriptive intimacy are all here for the taking.The main character Jamie is a spineless wimp who does whatever it takes to please others. I won't read anything further from this author."
5,One of the best historicals I've read in a long time,"I approached this story reluctantly, since it isn't a happily ever after type of story in the Bible, and I wasn't sure how it would translate to an 18th century Scottish setting, but once I started reading, I was captivated by Ms. Higgs' ability to retell this story in a believable, moving way. I especially liked the realistic way of dealing with Leana's (Leah's) and Lachlan's (Laban's) motivations. I always sympathized more with Rachel in the Genesis story, but I was much more drawn to her older sister in Thorn in My Heart. At the same time, Ms. Higgs makes one feel sympathy and understanding for all three characters caught in this love triangle. The ending is very powerful. I really look forward to reading the other volumes in this saga."
1,Disappointing,"I love Liz Curtis Higg's non fiction books, and was excited to see this series. Alas, I found the story to be forced (yes, I know it's based on the Biblical story of Jacob and Esau). For me, the way Ms Curtis-Higgs chose to update the story just didn't seem realistic...many parts didn't seem plausible at all! I had to force myself to finish the first book. Unfortunately, I'd purchased the entire series. I gave the books to our church library as I couldn't bring myself to read them. Apparently, others have felt differently as there are plenty of positive reviews."
5,thorn in my heart,Book arrived in timely manner in the condition accurately described by the seller.thank you
2,Language on CD Too Hard to Understand,"I couldn't understand what the reader was saying on the CD. Her accent made her speech nearly indiscernible to me. I had to start over again and again. When I did understand the basic plot and recognized it as a version of the Bible's story, I thought the story was slow. It gained momentum about a third of the way through when the protagonist sought a wife. It didn't match the second Biblical story, however, that the author started to portray (Jacob hoping to have Rachel for a wife and getting Leah). It was impossible for it to match since men could not take two wives in the culture of the author's setting. So the author just ""fixed"" it and ended the story."
5,Exciting world-wide action/thriller!,"The author quickly reels the reader in with nonstop action, and, in classic style, leaves the reader yearning for more. Readers of mystery/thriller novels are sure to be pleased with this yarn, which neatly weaves the many plots and characters into a coherent whole."
5,Handbook for College Admissions by Hayden,"This book explains the rules for entering colleges. For instance,more selective colleges have tougher rules and fewer seatsavailable. This work teaches how to work around these rules.For instance, the author recommends that you take stockof the available scholarship and grant money, visit the college,develop relationships, take advantage of family legacies andmake it known if the college is a first choice. Sometimes,colleges ask former teachers about the quality of the academicwork performed. In interviews, the author recommends to beassertive, to probe the interviewer and to ask analyticalquestions. This book is valuable if the purchaser implementssome of the recommended techniques/approaches."
3,Worth watching once...,"Angel cop wasn't bad... but it wasn't great either. After seeing ""Akira"" and ""Vampire Hunter D"", I was hoping to see something as epic in ""Angel cop""... it was okay, but it didn't really compare very well. The story wasn't bad, the action was pretty good and the bad-guys were interesting... the only thing this film really needed was some originality!"
3,"Good anime, but certainly not the best.","Angel Cop is a good movie to see if you're looking for a lot of violence coupled with some rather cool animated effects. On the criteria of animation alone, Angel Cop is worthy of any anime fan's attention. The animation is detailed and fast-paced. However, if you're looking for an involved character-oriented storyline, look elsewhere. The characters in Angel Cop are little more than small parts of the overall storyline, which is surprisingly simplistic. Based on the high quality of animation and the sheer length of it, it might be worthy of purchase if you can't find a rental copy."
2,Okay... but that's about it.,"I ordered this tape to test a theory... that I like my anime fairly light and humourous. I'm not sure if this was the right one to test that theory with, as ""Angel Cop,"" while dark, gritty and bloody, is also a pretty standard tale from the cyberpunk genre. (The characters are morally questionable, they are working for bosses who are corrupt and getting ready to screw everyone, and in the end, pretty much everyone dies.)I do like the fact that this single tape contains a complete story, but I was still left feeling as though I wanted something a bit more original. Maybe ""Angel Cop"" just isn't a tale that holds up well because of the passage of time?"
2,Boring anime.,"Angel Cop is a typical action flick. Lots of violence and just enough plot to justify all the blood and gore. That can be interesting if done right, which is not the case here. Everything is just repetitive, to the point that mindless violence does indeed become mindless violence. Take the final fight sequence for example. It takes nearly 2 episodes out of total 6 to kill the final boss. During which, the boss comes back from the dead number of times only to delay what is inevitably a predictable ending."
4,really good anime!,"Well, I have to say that there is better anime out there, but this is a very entertaining anime. For one, it has very nice action scenes and has decent dubbing. On the downside, the animation looked a little old and the story may not be the best, but this anime sure has it's kicks. The character Angel is at first drawn poorly, but then, somehow, she looks better and better. Finally, despite its downsides, I highly recommend Angel Cop to be in everyones anime collections."
5,Mr. Piano - Some of the Best,"As a Roger Williams fan, I am glad to see he has been included in the 20th Century Masters - Millennium Collection. Mr. Williams is one of the true ""Stars"" of Adult - Easy Listening Music with a career of hits spanning from 1955 to 1980. His magic behind the piano has earned him the title of best selling pianist in recording history.Memorable songs played by Mr. Williams, include ""Autumn Leaves"" which spent over four weeks at the Number One spot. This song alone has sold over three million copies and it was his first recorded single back in 1955. This was and remains incredible for a piano recording. ""Born Free"" which hit the top ten in 1966 and ""The Impossible Dream"" which is my favorite are included here.Mr. Williams compiled the music on this collection so I can't help wonder if these are his favorites, our favorites or both. This is a welcome addition to anyone's collection."
3,A scholarly search for a new worldview lacking objectivity,"While presenting a fairly comprehensive examination of the issues which highlight the weaknesses and limitations of the traditional Neutonian/Cartesian worldview, Dr. Woodhouse searches for a new worldview that can provide answers to a broader spectrum of reality, including the paranormal. Unfortunately, in the process he pays mere lip service to existing worldviews that already offer such answers (e.g., the judeo-christian worldview). It seems as though he is searching for an alternative explanation, being unwilling to accept the implications of existing ones."
2,NOT FOR EVERYONE,Not practical and not easy or interesting to do. Eventhough I love Eckhard Tolle and his books.
3,Too New Agey,"I just started using this DVD and I don't have much good to say about it. First of all the quality of the DVD menu is not good. It is difficult to navigate from one button to the next. Then she starts out with a energy cleansing releasing section, which I can say I enjoyed mostly but would never do it again. I didn't enjoy the dramatics of carrying an invisible ball of energy around with me. I know how to move energy and I don't need to do that, but maybe that's me. Then I tried the Qi Yoga postures and this was alright a little disconnected and also a little to flight of fancifulness to the moves. I like regular yoga better. I don't know, I can't imagine many people really enjoying this."
3,"Good history, Lacks Emotion or Psychological Depth","This book was a fun journey into what it might have been like to be one of Somerled's crew - fighting to restore order to 12th century Scotland - warding off Norse Raiders as well as English lords. I enjoyed it and I think it's a good semi-non-fiction work.However, I was disappointed that there wasn't any emotional or psychological depth to the story. We never learn what motivates Somerled, or what he thinks about or why he's giving his life to his cause. Sure, we can assume and guess, but it would have added a lot to the story to have journeyed inside his heart and mind in addition to his ships.I'm still glad I read it, though."
2,"For the Traveler, not the Simple Drinker","I was expecting a detailed account of wines each of the domaines had to offer. Rather, it is a tour guide for potential visitors to the area. While I recognize - and fully agree with - the way the each of them are rated, but is it current?"

3,Stamboul Train,Not Graham Greene's most enjoyable book. I couldn't really engage with the characters and the setting was really quite dreary.
3,"Greene, story teller extraordinaire!","Vintage, early Greene but still hugely entertaining. Trans-Europe train trip that's full of thrills and spills - mostly blood! Far better on the page than on film."
5,Squirrels hate this!,After watching the squirrels ignore the corn I put out for them and attack the bird feeders.... They still try but only one made it by leaping from the roof(one story) and then slid off.
3,"Keeps the squirrels away, but watch out for the sticker!!","I had no problems at all with the company and the baffle works great with keeping the squirrels away, but getting that huge sticker off made me wish I had bought another one. I spent about an hour and a half stripping it off and using Goo Gone. I would not buy that baffle again. Why in the world would they put that huge sticker (just look at the picture) on there and glue it on there like that? There is no way I was going to put that baffle out in my yard with a big label on it, so I had to get it off. I have removed many stickers in my life, but that was bad!"
2,Meh,"A bit heavier than I expected, and a bit flimsy in terms of getting the ends to close. Two complaints1. The product label, which you can see in the product photo, doesn't remove cleanly. Now I have a large white splotch on the baffle from the label glue holding the underside paper of the label. I suppose I can soak this in water overnight and maybe the glue and paper will come off, but this is an unnecessary annoyance.2. The opening of the bolt that attaches to the pole, on which the baffle rests, is too large for a common pole size. So it tends to slip down. Yes, the product states that this bolt has a certain dimension, but it's an inconvenience to have to measure the diameter of the pole. And it seems trivial to have made this product with a bolt that is slightly tighter to accommodate a range of regular pole dimensions."
5,Peace of Mind,"I have a feeling that if the squirrels really wanted what I have hanging on my feeder, they may not be baffled by this product but so far none of the little bushy tailed rodents have tried to circumvent this device because of the easy pickings provided by kind hearted neighbors. The product assembled easily, stays in place well. I pulled off the sticker very slowly and most of it came right off but I got impatient at the end and gave it a big yank and left some sticker behind. From the looks of things, this product will work with a square shepherd's hook pole as well."
3,The Hexer DVD,"I've read the book (at least the one translated into English) and have the PC game. I would love to have seen the entire TV series from which this film was patched together. The ""patching"" is somewhat haphazard and the film lacks continuity. Their special effects aren't too great. Don't care for the translation of the title. ""The Hexer"" doesn't cut it. the ""Witcher"", which is the title of the computer game is a better one. All in all, however, it is a fascinating film, the more so because it feels so ""foreign"". They should have given their title actor a better wig. It looks too phoney."
1,Disappointed.,"I returned this item because the main button controller, a joystick type button, did not work, I barely got it to work right a few times, after trying repeatedly. Also, when (trying) to change settings in the menu, it crashed (it errored and had to be turned back on). I don't know if all units are like this, maybe just mine was defective/broken, but it seems like it was a bad design at any rate."
3,Not for amateurs,"I really can't figure out how many stars to give this book, because I think it depends on your musical expertise. For strong amateurs and professionals, it's apparently a 5-star book. It was way too advanced for me: I tried to read a few pages and just gave up.This book is a lot tougher than the usual liner notes which come with classical music."
1,Cross Country Camera,"I purchaced one of these cameras in Indiana for a cross country trip. It worked from Indiana to South Dakota. I replaced it in Tacoma, Washington, then continued home to Alaska. I replaced it again in Alaska. The camera will turn on and off by itself. I have changed batteries with no luck. I e-mailed Olympus and asked if any one else had a problem. I was told no, all of there cameras worked fine. They offered to repair if I sent to California, but that was a big hassle. Camera now collects dust and is not worthy of the garage sale pile. I will not buy another Olympus product and would suggest you do not either."
4,This book is great!,"If you are into nitpicking, this book is great. While reading it, I was able to remember most of the scenes that were discussed, but the best way to read this book is with the episode playing in the background. Some nits require that you freeze and rewind to catch it. Each episode review contains trivia questions, but they are hard, so dont feel bad if you get them wrong. Also, Season seven is not covered in this one. It is included in part 2. I recommend this for al Trekkers. This author has also come out with a Deep Space Nine book, and Original series book, and an X-files book, as well as a sequel to this one. It must be nice to make a living nitpicking TV episodes!"
4,Galaxy Quest meets real life,"Everything you never wanted to know about the first six seasons of Star Trek the Next Generation is listed in this book.From the contradictory remarks by Worf concerning bathing, (how could they miss that, to classic lines like ""He probably figures that we don't get to see a lot of handsome women out this way and someone like you might get a little more cooperation from me...He's probably right.""Farrand celebrates the fun lines, evaluates plots, throws heavy blows at things that offend him (particularly the message of one episode), and even finds one that he can't find anything wrong with.Do you want to know which episodes I am referring to? You'll have to get the book. This is however for hardcore Star Trek TNG fans, casual fans may enjoy it and non-fans will declare, ""get a life."" but you know what. They don't have to buy the book.Worth your money depending on which group you belong to."
4,"I may be biased, but...","I may be biased (since about 60% to 70% of the material in the book originated from me, used with my permission) but I think Phil did a commendable job organizing the information and presenting it in a readable fashion.I'm known as the King of Nitpicking Star Trek (in all forms). If something is out of place or just plain wrong--I'll notice it and report it."
1,Grapes are sour,"Nothing new. Just repeat from old text books under a new book heading. All theory, no practical working examples. A flop attempt in a difficult engineering area.Th book will sell because of its name, but once you read it, you will get the same above feeling as mine."
1,not worth the money,I agree totally with the previous reviewer. I bought this book because I thought it would be helpful from a practical point of view but the material was basically a repeat from previous textbooks on the subject. Totally theoretical presentation of the material with no practical examples given. The book is really not worth reading in my opinion
1,Misleading title,"I agree with the previous reviews. I think the title is kinda misleading as it's basically a book about the 'Luo Converter', nothing new. I didn't learn much besides that the author is quite biased toward his own favorite topology... Not worth the money to figure that out."
2,Don't be fooled!,"This book is not all that other reviewers have made it to be. The plates are often vague and marginally helpful in field identification. This may be an ok first guide, but birders should look elsewhere for raptor identification tips!"
4,thorough reference,This book certainly lives up to the standards of other peterson guides which I keep handy all the time. Hawks can be tricky identifying so I use this book in tandem with The Photographic Guide to North American Raptors. These two books together make a great set
4,Very nice book,"It is not quite complete as to all the types of Eagles and Hawks out there, but is is nice and gives you general information for your area. I did have to buy another book to make it more complete!"
1,Fill my eyes with that double vision,"I recently purchased a high definition television and decided to pick this item up, primarily due to the low price and the availability. Unfortunately, the picture that I got with the Arsenal connector was unsatisfactory. The picture was too fuzzy and blurry, much worse that the S-Video connection that I had used previously. I tried several different pairs of component video cables, but to no avail. I found a cheap, multi-system high-definition connector at my local video game store and it works just fine. I'll be returning the Arsenal kit to Amazon."
4,Tia Lola is good multicultural material,"I read this and thought it had a lot to offer. It introduced some Spanish words to the reader, and it touched on many subjects that kids, especially boys, would like: baseball, friends, the hardship of moving, feeling alone when your parents divorce. The message of be yourself, and don't be embarrassed of your heritage was cleverly disguised: it wasn't in your face, but gently told with reinforcement from the character of Tia Lola. Funny, touching and a good read. Recommend it for kids who are having a rough time adjusting to a parent's divorce, or recent move."
4,HOW TIA LOLA CAME TO STAY,THIS BOOK IS ABOUT A FAMILY AND TIA LOLA. THEY LIVE IN VERMONT AND TIA LOLA LIVES IN DOMINICAN REPLUBLIC.ONE DAY SHE COMES TO VISIT THEM FOR VACATION.TIA LOLA DOESN'T SPEAK ENGLISH SO MIGUEL AND JUANITA HAVE TO TEACH TIA LOLA HOW TO SPEAK.WELL I DID LIKE THIS BOOK BECAUSE IT IS INSPIRING TO ME. SHE HAS TO LEARN ENGLISH SO THAT SHE CAN COMMUNICATE TO OTHER PEOPLE.THIS BOOK IT IS THE SAME AS MY LIFE. I CAME TO THIS COUNTRY FOR OPPUTUNITIES THAT THIS COUNTRY OFFERS. I HAD TO LEARN ENGLISH TO SPEAK TO OTHER PEOPLE. IT WAS HARD. THIS BOOK REFLECTS THE LIFVES OF AN IMMIGRANT. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO SOMEONE ELSE.
5,A moving multicultural story,"Tia Lola has just arrived from the Dominican Republic with her bright dresses and odd habits, and Miguel is not so certain her odd ways are attractive or acceptable. Her habits make him stand out from his Vermont classmates and as hard as Miguel tries, he can't keep her hidden from his new friends. Her odd habits change his life in this moving multicultural story."
1,"Big disappointment, did nothing for my feet","I only walk barefoot at home, never outside. I use a foot cream every night, and then put on a pair of footies. I also use a foot file in the shower a few times a week. I'm not as concerned with price as I am with keeping my heels smooth as I live in the south and wear sandals and open-heeled shoes all summer.I'm trying lots of different brands to find the best. So far, I have tried DDF, Gold Bond from the drugstore, Qtica and Kerasol. Qtica's foot balm is absolutely the least effective of them all. I used it for 10 days, every night. My heels still looked, and felt dry.So far, the best product has been Kerasol. Second place is DDF."
3,If only...,"I would have really enjoyed this book if it had really been about her growing up, but sadly it was more about her opinions. I'm not big on reading political opinions; Talor definitely bored me with hers. I did enjoy the parts of the book that had to do with her growing up; it's a wake up call alright. If only she hadn't gone into political/social rants..."
5,Excellent clerkship resource,"This book is quite comprehensive despite its small size, and fits in your white-coat pocket for easy reference on the wards. Much less bulky than some of the other peds ""pocket"" books out there."
1,No Coperation- defective merchandise,I bought this & the adapter part did not work- I used the small card in my son's adapter & it worked- I emailed & asked for a new adapter- NO NEW ADAPTER!! I was very disappointed. I did not want to return the entire item because only the adapter did not work-
1,Pump Noisy and Getting Worse,"This is a loud pump you can hear the noise inside while driving with he windows down, Replaced with another pump and it is super quiet. Poor product seller has not contacted me back after emailing them."
2,Apparently written by the same person...,All the stories use very similar descriptions for bodily parts and would seem to be all written by the same person. All the men are 'huge' and all the women 'shapely' or similar. I would recommend just buying a copy of penthouse forum instead. The real kicker is that this is put forward as the unexpected results of research. Uhh-huh.
2,Just too contrived,"While the back cover of the book boasts that the stories are ""absolutely true!"", I don't believe it. They are just too contrived, as some of the other reviewers have already stated. I was hoping for something arousing, and instead I got something formulaic."
3,What's your erotic pleasure- this book has it.,"This book is just too neat- formulaic- they have an older couple, mixed race, one for voyeurs, one for people who like to chance being caught- the harried couple who have to escape to the movies, the older couple out walking and the military couple whose reunion is hot and heavy. Like another reviewer- the reader should understand this is really like those made up letters to Penthouse- not that there is anything wrong with the imagination of sex... It definitely is titatlating.... and they have more ways to describe genetalia than Heinz has pickles..."
1,typical drivel,"This book, while promising some interesting reading, is written and edited (or collected) by authors having little literary endearment. The scenarios seemed trite and second-hand and only sightly interesting, but even so, very contrived. I would question the authors intent, as a work such as this seemed quite outside their actual fields of knowledge and creative ability, whether fact or fiction."
1,Should have been fiction,"I traveled to Vietnam as well and I don't think that Hunt's book is a very accurate depiction of the people or the country. Good thing he's not a good writer or else he would have been the first ""Jayson Blair."""
4,An interesting portrait of the new Vietnam in a travelogue,"Christopher Hunt went to Vietnam with the aim of traveling down theHo Chi Minh Trail and gather ideas for a novel. He wrotea travelogue instead which details his adventures and thepeople he meets. If you find yourself interested in Mr.Hunt's writing search for him on the Web. Some of hisfiction appears in ezines. Catherine Karnow did the coverphotography. Forty-one of her pictures from Vietnam appearsin the ezine @TLAS.Issues such as the MIA's, the faith of the Amerasian andthe boat-people are addressed in passing. There are manyindividual portraits of people from all over the country."
3,This seems odd to me that...,"This is the only OVERKILL album that I really dont care for. Since everyone else loves it. I loved Bloodletting and RELIXIV is totally kick ass. Devil by the tail, Sound of Dying, and Struck Down are the only ones I really like. I mean dont get me wrong its good but I dont think its as good as everyone says. From Under Ground and Below was better than this."
4,a return to their roots of thrash,"this cd has been along time to come overkill has made several cds since years of decay,horrorscope and wfo but none have come this close to their thrash roots like this one has.not to discount the other releases inbetween but they were a different breed and missing their fury and style,even though many songs in that abyss of missed thrash cd were great song and could have made two excellent album out of the songs for five cdd that just didn't measure up!kill box 13 seams to not have a weak (throw away tracK/skip song) on it.this bring it back to basics in my book strait forward thrash."
4,Never a Doubt,"As anyone who truly knows this band, they have always been the underdog in the commercial music world. Anyone who has seen them live understands they are true to their art. This album will not break any major ""new"" ground but is not going to disappoint.Heavy, heavy, & more heavy. This is what blistering guitars is all about and the power of REAL metal. I would have to agree that this is possibly their best complete album since Horrorscope even tho the live albums are also over the top."
2,easily overkill's weakest album,"first off i wanna say that overkill are one my favorite thrash bands ever, but this album is just plain weak, containing their most uncreative and uninspired material to date. how can anyone give this slop 4 or 5 stars! this disc is nothing more than overkill rehashing their older material(ie. ""devil by the tail"" recycles the solo section riff from ""the cleansing"" off their '96 album ""the killing kind"") and blatantly ripping off other bands( am i the only person who realizes that the breakdown riff in ""damned"" is stolen from slayer's ""raining blood""!). the only thing keeping this from being a 1 star album is dave linsk's playing, who is the best guitarist they've had since merritt gant. overkill's well has defintely gone dry on this one. if you wanna hear overkill at their peak, check out ""horrorscope"", ""the years of decay"", or ""taking over""."
3,"Good on all counts, however...","Granted Blitz and the boys aren't going to keep writing and releasing Horrorscope every single album just for me, but I come to every Overkill album with that expectation.This is a good album, but it's not a great album. It's perfectly solid, well thought out, well put together recognizable Overkill, and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. Unfortunately what that give us is more of the same. When the songs all sound similar enough that I can't keep the titles straight easily, I know that it hasn't grabbed me in the way that the earlier efforts have.Still my praise and devotion at the temple of Overkill is not misplaced, if only that they keep doing it. They haven't let me down yet. Now that I've reached an age where many of my metal heroes are dying off or fading out, it is refreshing that Overkill keeps grinding away.The album is worth the money. Just go get it and give it a shot.Tom"
5,One of the top metal bands EVER - once again they're back!,"Overkill is so incredibly metal! They are one of the few metal bands from the hay day of heavy metal that has kept it real and not pulled a Metallica/Megadeth/Anthrax/etc. Every album they have put out is real speed/heavy metal that you can count on. Kill Box 13 is no different. Every song is awesome! If you're an Overkill fan, you will love this album. If you're just getting into Overkill, then this album is a must buy, and if you've never heard Overkill, then you don't know what you're missin'. What else can I say? KILLBOX 13 kicks [rear-end]."
5,THRASH LIVES!,"No tricks, no gimmicks, just pure THRASH! Overkill return with an incredible album full of moshy, groovy thrash! Reminds me of the good stuff from the 80's without the hiss of the cassette tape!"
5,"Engrossing tale, characterizations outstanding. The best yet","This is Abbott's best mystery yet. His characters are real,and sympathetic. The mystery is engrossing. I loved thisbook, and I'm picky about mysteries."
2,Not as much fun as I thought,"This game wasn't as much fun as I thought it would be, and I wasn't expecting much. I figured there would be more to building up your troops. Nope all you do is build roads to connect cities and explore to get get more people. Then when you are attacked you just click on the city nearest the enemy and they fight. There is no strategy involved at all. That being said if your looking for a game to play when you only have 5 or 10 mins it's good for that. Also it's only 49 cents so if you add it to a order that qualifies for free shipping the price is great. But if you have to pay the shipping don't waste you money."
1,Not even a PC game int he classic sense,"I am an avid history type game player. games such as Age of Empires (AOE) and Age of Empires II, Age of Mythology, Age of Empires III etc etc, if your expecting this game to be that way, it's not even close. There was no thought put into the game, which is why the game can be bought for $1 now. It's boring and doesn't require any thinking. Nothing exciting about the game. Which again is why the game is $1. I have no problems with the other people who reviewed it and gave it 4-5 stars. Not every game is for everyone. To me, it isn't even worth the one dollar."
5,"Frida Kahlo, what a life!",Frida is one of my very favorite artists and her life was not an easy one.Even with her back problems and her strange relationships she managed to be anextraordinary artist and this book shares her story with you from startto finish.
2,Yanni Petsopoulos cannot write past a third grade level.,"I believe that the book should have been more in detail, as much of the research I was doing was incomplete due to the horrendous nature of the detail."
4,"Fab, Sparkle, long hair, shake, rattle, rocking, boogie","First piece of vinyl I ever bought (at age 10) was Wig Wam Bam, and the fact that I am prepared to put my name under this review at age 37 is testimony to the longevity of their sound. They were fab, folks dont know they're born these days, spice girls, I so pity todays teens!"
3,Glam rules!,"This cd has their biggest hit,but for the real best of Sweet drop down to their original Desolation Boulevard,containing all the original hits. For a real rockin' experience its a must!"
1,Stay away...,"...from this record - there are just remakes on it. Ever since leadsinger Brian Connolly left the group in 1979 the rest of those guys recorded the titles new, maybe for some copyright-reasons or whatever. BUT: There ist no Sweet-sound without him. These are not the hits I heard in my teen-time. So: If you wanna get the spirit of Glam, try to reach original recordings of that time - it'll be worth it."
4,These California Nights...,"I bought this CD because it has one of my favorite songs on it that I couldn't find on other compilations (""California Nights""). I can't say that the songs on this CD really are ""The Best"" - I'd rather say that these songs are some of the best of their LATER music career. Still, no regrets. Listen in and decide for yourself."
5,"BEFORE EIGHTIES HAIR-BANDS, THERE WAS 'THE SWEET'!","Before Poisen or Warrant, before Ratt or Twisted Sister, before Whitesnake or Motley Cru, there was The Sweet!The Sweet had one major thing going for them--they knew how to write catchy rock-n-roll tunes. Their songs were tight, and had more hooks than a professional fisherman's tacklebox. (Sorry about that last sentence. I couldn't help myself).All the great songs are here: ""Little Willy"", ""Barroom Blitz"",""Action"", ""Fox on the Run"", as well as others. If you enjoy those bands I mentioned above, you'll get a kick out of this CD. If you don't enjoy those bands, then you probably aren't reading this review, anyway."
3,Hos SWEET it is!,Was disappointed to read all these weren't the original versions-they sure sound ok. My other disappointment with this otherwise fun album is that Love Is Like Oxygen is the abbreviated version. Just love the extended play version!!!!
2,"dissapointed , not original cuts","These songs are not the original cuts. They are songs performed by Brian Connoly. Which is O.K. but I feel you should know, and not be dissapointed."
3,"Alright Fellas, Let's Go!","Strictly speaking this title 'The Best Of', is only half right. The hits from 'Little Willy"" onwards are almost here. For some reason 'Hell Raiser' is omitted, which is criminal. The other glaring omission for me is the minor hit 'Turn It Down', one of Chinn & Chapman's greatest, and their attempt to write like The Sweet. Anyway if you can't find a more complete hits collection, and there are plenty to choose from. This will do."
3,More Glam less of the Ham!,"Sweet compilation albums are a minefield. When you have sifted through all the dross-re-recordings of Brian Connolly past his best and all the filler track albums you are normally back to square one. On the other hand this album is ok. Most of the hits are here,(late 72 and on) irritatingly the early 'bubblegum' ones aren't.So no 'Co Co' 'Alexander Graham Bell' and the like. Great tracks like 'Ballroom Blitz' and the bowie 'influenced' 'Gene Genie' are and this makes up a little. There are though a few too many album tracks that would only appeal to a minority."
1,Not so sweet,"I love ""Fox ont the Run"" but I found it to be the only track on the album I enjoyed. The other stuff was just noise."
1,"uh, what's the point","I love rock music, this is nothing more than 70's bubble-gum. Bought it for 1 song, won't listen to it again."
5,Nearly perfect,"This is probably the best single-disc overview of The Sweet's career. My only complaint is the one glaring ommission, and that is ""Hellraiser"". I would have swapped the cliche-ridden ""The Lies In Your Eyes"" for the genuine stormer that is ""Hellraiser"", which often opened their concerts back in the glory days of the '70s. Of the later material, ""Lost Angels"" is the lost hit by the band; it should have been released in the USA, but instead we got ""Funk It Up"", a rather lame disco-tinged number, which actually charted but is thankfully missing from this collection."
3,Sweet sounds on this CD,"Sweet's Best Of (with the pink cover, they seem to have several ""best of"" albums/CDs) is a good compliation from this unusual and highly-influential band. They kind of remind me of Ziggy Stardust-era David Bowie meets The Supremes mixed with guitar-driven rock like early Kiss. Listening to The Best of Sweet it's clear why bands like Def Leppard and Motley Crue are fans. With songs that range in style from a teeny booper Beach Boys sound to full 70s arena rock, this CD also provides an interesting perspective on the band's lengthy career. If you like bands like Queen, The Darkness, or are into 60s OR 70s classic rock, or like any of the bands that cite Sweet as an influence, this CD is worth listening to for sure. I'll always like Tia Carrere singing Ballroom Blitz better though! Standout tracks: Little Willy, Wig Wham Bam, Ballroom Blitz, The Six Teens, Fox On The Run, Love is Like Oxygen."
4,Sweet - 'The Best Of Sweet' (Capitol),"Review no.48. Good sixteen track compilation of what I assume is a collection of Sweet's singles from 1971-79. If anyone more or less defines 'glam rock',Sweet is the band to do just that. I recognized all but a few of these tunes. The hits that you remember are here, like ""Little Willy"", ""Ballroom Blitz"" (personally,I liked the cover that Krokus did better),""Fox On The Run""(has special meaning to me), ""Action"", ""Fever Of Love"" and ""Love Is like Oxygen"". Very nice. Should appeal to fans of Slade,early Queen,Gary Glitter and Ian Hunter."
4,"In the words of Fire Marshall Bill, ""Lemme show ya somethin""","OK. Here's the deal. Yes, most of these Ten Best albums suck because they leave off essential material. This one is no exception. So why, you ask, does it get 4 stars? Because, dear reader, it has the long, album version of ""Love Is Like Oxygen."" That's right! I know of no other Sweet collection which does. So unless you care to pay full or import prices for ""Level Headed"" pick this cheapo up and bask in 7 minutes of 'Love!'"
3,"Great performance, not that good issue.","This issue is a re-run of the 1995 live album Deep Space/Virgin Sky, but with fewer tracks. (So buy the original version instead, 4 stars!)It is based on a great performance at the House of Blues, LA, January 25, 1995. A special bonus is that Grace Slick made a one-night-comeback for this show (and album). Paul Kantner and Marty Balin are in great shape this night and deliver both new and old classics like The Light and Miracles."
3,Grows on you,"My father bought this cd for me when i was around 6 or 7 years old. Now years later i discovered it lying around and decided to listen to it. I like how they jazzed up old classic hits like ""Somebody to love"" and ""White rabbit"". I also throughly enjoyed the song ""Shadowloands"". Having it be a 1 night comeback performance for grace slick to the band i thought it was something special and overall a good cd. I just wish there were more songs on it though,which deducts as a few stars"
3,The Old School Dies,"This is the first Kate Morgan title I have read and I liked it. Although it does not rank in the top ten of my favorite mysteries, it moved along smoothly and kept my interest. It's a shame most of her other titles are out of print. I read this on an eight hour flight to Hawaii and it certainly made the time pass quickly. I shared it with a fellow passenger and she seemed to be entertained by it.I did feel that the protagonist, librarian Dewey James, could have used more depth. It seems like Morgan just missed the boat by inches of following the greats such as Paretsky and Grafton. Too bad because as a librarian who is also a lover of mysteries, I certainly would have jumped on the band wagon.It was enjoyable, however, and should be put on a list for fun summer reading."
5,I was on CNN...,"For ten years, I had a job in a major downtown revitalization district and my task was to attract people there to patronize the local merchants. One day in the mail, I got a catalog of movies on VHS (yes it was awhile ago) and DVDs and as I sifted through it, I said to myself that there were some really really really bad movies around. So I did a film festival entitled ""Really, really, really bad movies"" - ""Plan Nine from Outer Space,"" ""Attack of the Killer Tomatoes,"" ""Mesa of Lost Women,"" and a bunch more. One morning as I was doing my morning thing in the bathroom, I heard the series announced on the radio (and it was a BIG metro radio station). Next thing I know, I get a call from CNN for an interview and there I was handing Jean Moos a real heritage Killer Tomato! I guess there's a real affection for real bad flicks! ENJOY!"
2,Book of Lies,"I was sorely disappointed with this softcover book edition. It states on the back cover, for instance, that this is ""the first volume of The Wierd Works of Robert E. Howard"" and that it has ""meticulously restored to its original texts"" the stories within. Further that ""This volume begins with Spear and Fang, Howards first professional fiction sale, and condludes with Red Thunder, a gripping sword and sorcery tale."" Spear and Fang appear NOWHERE in this book and while Red Thunder is in the book, it does not ""conclude"" with it.In my opinion, leaving OUT Howard's first professional fiction sale and NOT concluding with Red Thunder (BOTH AS ADVERTISED ON THE BACK COVER) doesn't speak well of the ""meticulous"" alledged restoration alluded to.While containing almost two dozen Howard pieces, I somehow doubt the dedication, attention to detail and/or the ""expertise"" of the publisher as to authenticity or accuracy that should be a hallmark of a series of this sort. Don't waste your money."
5,Robert E. Howard Essential,"Robert E. Howard was a multi-genre dynamo, but his essential contribution to writing was through Weird Tales. This set of books gives you every story and poem for that pulp and gives you the opportunity to follow from his very first story Spear and Fang to his last story before his tragic death his progression in the macabre as well as the genre he created, Sword and Sorcery."
1,It does not work,"I simply bought this book after reading good reaviews. But now I am getting suspicious who wrote the reviews. Please read the one star reviews. It does not work. I have my master's degree from a university in US and lived for 10 years. So I am not a beginner yet I still have strong accent in my English which I want to reduce.The autor says on the cd, please repeat after her. But she does not give any pause and she just summerizes each chapter which I can do by myself. This book is just a bait to sell their other service from the website as other buyer said."
1,just don't !!!,"I have tried the book, I have tried her on-the-phone classes (by the way, $2,500.00) - it doesn't worth it! She will work with you from her house, and half of the time she will talk to her son and pet her dog."
3,"It's Nice and All, But....","Here's a quote for you: ""Never judge a book by its cover."" I have to admit that I was seduced by the beautiful book cover! I'd been looking for a great quote book to have on hand, and as there are so many random quote books on the market, I naturally picked the one that was aligned with my visual tastes. True, it's a nicely edited book, and I'm sure I will use it as a reference from time to time, but I think I was expecting more contemporary quotes. Or at least quotes that are not as holier-than-thou and preachy. Not to say that all the quotes in this book are religious, but imagine, if you will, a school teacher shaking her finger at you while you hang your head in shame...."
1,"Pendantic, confusing and poorly organized.",I found it impossible to follow the organization of material or the reasoning behind statements. Unusable to me.
4,Great find,"This is the first book by Dunning that I have come across (found it on our library free cart), and I was delighted by it. Not only is it packed full of the kind of book history/binding/creating trivia that I love, but the mystery was well done. The basic plot is that Mr. Janeway, a book dealer from Denver (and an ex-cop) goes to Seattle and gets involved in a mystery involving a possible previously unknown rare edition of the Raven, with a few murders thrown in, too. But the really fun part of the book is all the book dealer trivia, as I mentioned. I recommend this book highly both to lovers of a good mystery, and to people who just love books."
4,Many redeeming factors . . .,"The worst thing I can say about the book is that the mystery itself is pretty convoluted. But, it was a pleasure to learn about the ins and outs of bookmen, dealers, and small press printing. I am sure that the field is fraught with intrigue which provides a natural context for a mystery novel. I also enjoy the fact that Dunning's characters are engaged in an interesting pursuit. In fact, one almost has the feeling of a student as the information about rare book collecting rolls out. I really enjoyed the book"
4,"Well plotted, entertaining mystery","Cliff Janeway is an ex-cop and current used bookstore owner. When one of his old cronys from the Denver PD offer him a quick $5000 for picking up a bail jumper in Seattle Cliff takes the job, mainly because it also involves a rare copy of Poe's ""The Raven."" But all is not as it seems as Cliff gets drawn deeper and deeper into a forty year old mystery that finds him being hunted by the Seattle police for murder.John Dunning is a good writer. His characters are excellently drawn, his dialogue is crisp, and the plotting is tight. Cliff Janeway has a good ""voice"" and the book moves along well, never dull or boring. This is the first Bookman mystery I've read but I'll be looking for the others. This book stands way above the average run-of-the-mill books that pass for mysteries these days. I recommend it highly."
5,An Intelligent Mystery,"Having plowed through hundreds of murder mysteries that almost seem ""by the book"" (no pun intended), it was a delight to read ""The Bookman's Wake,"" and be introduced to Cliff Janeway. I learned more about the field of rare books and small house printing than I knew at the beginning, and was completely entertained throughout. Intelligence in writing seems to be missing in many of today's ""churn 'em out"" murder mysteries; Dunning brings wit, education, and humanity to bear and it comes out just wonderfully. I literally could not put this book down until I reached the last page...and now I'm hungry for more from this author. The next time I go into a used book store, I'll be looking with a much more educated ""eye"" than heretofore. Kudoes to John Dunning!"
2,Glad I'm finished,"Finally finished. It was like a marathon held in a field of molasses. Would have given this a 1 instead of 2, but there were pockets of interesting stuff about book collecting that tediously intercepted real action and mystery. As others noted, there was a compulsion to use trite cliches, and the book was way too long for what it delivered."
2,Disappointing Sequel,"I loved BOOKED TO DIE, and was eagerly looking forward to this sequel. Unfortunately, Dunning stumbles badly here with a plot that is too tedious and convoluted to hold the reader's attention. Even worse, all the characters are flat and spout neo-noir dialogue that isn't the least bit believable. The relationships that develop between the characters in this novel aren't in any way realistic, and I eventually had to put the book down mid-way through.If you're a bibliophile with a strong interest in book collection and bookmaking, this book may be worth a try, but I wouldn't recommend this book to anybody else."
2,"What a disappointment after ""Booked to Die""","As good as ""Booked to Die"" is, that's how lifeless this second volume in the Janeway series is. The characters are flat and poorly developed; the prose is fat and unrewarding. (Chapter 42, for instance, is a 15-page summary of what a secondary character discovered in her travels--despite the fact that the book is from Janeway's first-person point of view.) Much too tedious for my taste. Had to force myself to finish it and even then I felt as though perhaps I shouldn't have bothered...Mr. Dunning, please give us a Janeway closer to the first version next time around--a Janeway who is an interesting fellow."
5,The Bookman's Wake,Diffirent than other books in series. Lots of intrigue. Keeps you on your toes trying to figure out what's going to happen next
4,"Not as good as ""Booked to Die"" but, still gets 4 stars","John Dunning's Booked to Die was a superb novel, which I gave five stars, I only gave this one four. Why?I think the author tried too hard - put in just one extra plot twist when it was not needed, added just one more character when it was not needed, and ended up with a book that only came close to the first in this Bookman series.The plot follows our hero, Cliff Janeway, as he tracks down a book, and along the way solves murders.Again the author draws upon his knowledge of the fine book business to give the reader a portal into that very different world - and again it is very interesting.If you read the first novel, and plan on reading the series (which I recommend) - then by all means read this one. It is still a good 4 star read and very enjoyable - I was just looking forward to another 5 star effort and this book came up short in that regard."
2,I was not impressed.,"I was not at all impressed with this novel. I have read far better mysteries; this one seemed trite and contrived. Granted, the parts relating to book collecting were interesting, but the actual mystery left me completely uninterested. I didn't even really feel compelled to finish the book. The dialogue was stale, and the characters were poorly developed and unbelievable. In my opinion, if you're going to read a mystery, you should try someone else."
2,Alas...,"What a disappointment, after the bright promise of Dunning's first Janeway mystery. This is just too long, too overblown. Apparently the author thought that more was better, and he just piled it on. Blame some of this on the editor at the publishing house. If about 100-150 pages had been omitted, this might have been worth reading. As Gertrude Stein told Hemingway: ""Prune, Ernest, prune."""
1,don't waste your time,"This book is flawed by dialogue full of cliches, and most of the characters are foul-mouthed. The mystery itself is so convoluted that I lost track of what was going on, lost interest, and only finished the book because I hate leaving one unfinished. I had read Booked to Die and found it to be ok for light entertainment, and the insight into the bookworld was a redeeming factor. Not so with Bookman's Wake. I have got to believe Mr. Dunning can do better than this."
1,"Fascinating facts on books, but sophomoric writing and plot","This book provides some interesting insights and fascinating details on book making but, as a mystery, it's dull and far too long. Dunning takes paragraphs and full pages to describe scenes that could be dealt with in a line or two. If ever there was a book in need of editing it's this one. It seems he's also determined to put in every trite phrase and hard boiled comment he's ever read in the Chandler and Hammett mysteries."
2,Competent Ross MacDonald Knockoff,"This is yet another variation on the classic American private detective novel. This book is competently written and plotted but lacks originality. This book has many of the features developed by Raymond Chandler, and in particular, Ross MacDonald. The protagonist is a decent but tough detective and the plot involves a troubled young heroine, family pathology, and murder. These are the elements of the typical Ross MacDonald mystery. The Bookman's Wake is decent entertainment but if you like this style of mystery, read Ross MacDonald for superior versions of this genre."
1,Cliches and Claptrap Mar a Perfectly Good Essay,"In a word -- nauseating. It's a shame that author John Dunning felt it necessary to hang an implausible and downright annoying plot, filled with detective-story cliches and inconsistent cardboard characters, on the bones of a fascinating essay on the world of rare book dealing. The book would have been half the thickness without all the claptrap, and a far better read besides. To quote the character he calls ""Eleanor Rigby"" (eeewwwww), ... The only thing that kept me reading, after the first couple of chapters, was that core. The man knows books, and loves them -- and makes the reader love them as well -- but he's no mystery writer. P.D. James is safe for the forseeable future, methinks."
3,A Bump in the Road,"I am on a journey to read the Bookman series. I love books, especially collectibles, so the Janeway novels resinate with me. I learned so much about books in the first book, that I guess I was expecting that same level of depth in the second. I did learn a great deal about the publishing and bookmaking process, but this novel veered in a different direction.After reading the first book, and eagerly looking forward to the second, I was somewhat disappointed. For me, this novel tends to ramble, goes in fits and spurts, and, at times, leaves me feeling confused. The plot seems to take off in several directions at the same time, and there are many characters to monitor.I still love the author's style of writing; his descriptions, character studies, and the intensity of Janeway, the lead character, but this was, for me, a bump in the Bookman road. I'm looking forward to book three (just ordered), and hope it will be smoother traveling."
5,"Twists and Turns to the very end,Still keeps you guessing","This is the first Dunning novel I have had a chance to read. I intend to go right out and pursue the other volumes. As a die-hard quality mystery fan who does not go in for spy stories or blood-n-guts volumes, I find this action filled book a delight to my English sensibilities. There is the obligatory violence, though it's minimal and not too graphic. There is the romance. There is the thoroughly dislikeable villain. Binding these all together is an intellectual plot and a thorough love of all things related to book collecting that keeps you on your toes throughout the book. Even on the last page, you are still wondering what will happen next. You will NEVER guess whodunnit!"
1,terrible read,This book is a boar and confusing- too many characters and confusing. With that being said its not interesting either.
5,The Bookman,"If you love mysteries and you love books, this is your dream book. John Dunning always puts Cliff in the thick of things and brings along a treasure trove of books with him. The mystery is great, of course, as always, and Cliff rules the day in his inimmitable fashion. A great read!"
5,Better than Boccelli's version!,"Donna has outdone herself again this time. Who would have thought Andrea's song could be done into an anthemic dance song? Only Donna could do something like that. The translation is awesome, truly poetic. Three cheers for her and her producer & arranger."
1,"I wish you hadn't done this, Donna!!","Her version of ""Con te partiro"" just ruined a beautiful Italian song. Her English lyrics of this song ( I don't think she translated eventhough CD cover says) is BAD!! Some people might say this CD is fun, but music arrangement is also terrible. They could have done much better. This is the worst cover version of any other kind of songs I have ever heard before. I'm very disapoited. Sorry, Donna this is your ""Last Dance""."
1,1 star only because a negative number is not possible,What was Donna Summer thinking when she butchered this beautiful song? I am using the Bocelli version in my upcoming wedding and found the Donna Summer version by accident while searching on the internet. I decided to give it a listen based on the previous Amazon reviews - I urge anyone who has heard the original version to pass on Summer's remake. She has managed to take an almost etherial song and make it nearly unrecognizable. Not ONE of the words in her version are accurate. You will soon realize that Donna Summer killed the spirit of the song when she screeched out her remix. Final Thought: DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM!
5,This is the best single edition,"This song was released as a single in different formats. You will find other cds labeled as Part 1 and Part 2, plus a few imports. If you are wondering which one to choose *I have all of them*, this is the one you're looking for. It has the radio edit plus Rosabel mix and a big plus which is Hex Hector's remix of Love On and On."
3,Entertaining but poorly executed,"I'm a big fan of the Black Keys, and I love Dan's raw, gritty guitar tone. Though the videography is high-energy and the DVD is entertaining overall, the entire concert suffers from really poor audio quality. Dan's sound is no doubt really heavy on his studio albums, but his guitars always retain note definition and clarity that really showcase his playing skills. I don't know how they recorded this concert, but the audio tracks are really muffled - as if recorded under a blanket. The sound is very dark and distant sounding, much like you might expect from a bootleg concert recording from someone's little tape recorder.The drums and vocals, too, lack the presence and power of a really high quality recording.I imagine the concert was spectacular live, but much more effort should have been put into capturing the audio properly."
2,disappointment and latent plagiarism,"You may love Jack White or not, but if you have viewed the White Stripes Blackpool video, you have already seen this one. Meg's drumming was basic enough but evidentally not poor enough to dissuade Patrick from performing at a lower level. An arguement can be made that Dan Auerbach can outplay and outsing Jack...it's really a taste call. Personally I'll always go for the original copier rather than the copy copier. So I say we all chip in and get Dan a decent drummer that knows the genre...ok, let's hire Cody Dickinson of the N. MS. All-Stars. After a few rehearsals, we'll send the boys out on tour and shoot a video. But let's arm the videographers with state of the art equipment and warn them against making it look like they shot it in 1972. We'll have a better product than anything the White Stripes or Black Keys are capable of. Dan Auerbach deserves better than this video - demand better from him."
4,Good DVD,"If you have never been graced with seeing ""The Keys"" live, then you should probably pick up this DVD. I'm not sure it captures the emotion or heavy air of a real show, but its still a good watch."
4,Dark Shadows,"As a child I watched this every afternoon after school, as an adult it brought back a lot of great memories. I love this show."
3,packaging is different edition,"this is a different edition from the ones with the red borders. it doesn't have the pamphlet of the episodes list and synopsis or the photo postcard. it's in a different box which is no big deal(thinner,clear plastic) but it doesn't match the others ."
4,Never saw these before,When I was young I used to rush home to watch Dark Shadows. Love it then but was young enough then to want to play so around the time this collection started was the time I lost interest and decided to play now I am a grandmother and have time to enjoy the episodes I missed back then and fall in love with the series all over again. I love that they show them as they were filmed then even with all the flaws. Its amazing how the actors continue on with their lines inspite of all the things falling and noises heard off stage. I am hooked all over again.
5,A great business book and much more,"Time to Make the Donuts is a wonderful read. I bought it because I've bought at least a million cups of Dunkin' Donuts coffee. What I found was an insightful and entertaining story of a dynamic individual who found time for making far more than donuts. There were lessons, both business and personal, that resonated with me. It is a well-written look into an exceptional life."
4,Solid-looking knockoff,"This is a knock-off of the RBC3 replacement battery cartridge for the APC BackUPS 600 (and will possibly fit other models). This time the cartridge was a perfect fit and did not require shoehorning into the UPS like some past replacements I have bought. So far, it is working fine. It remains to be seen how long it will last, but given the price disparity between the knockoff and the genuine APC cartridge, it should prove an economical substitute.I would have given this item five stars except that the wire connecting the two cells was of a smaller gauge than the original. Because of this I chose to reuse the original wire. Shipping was prompt and the cartridge well packaged. I would buy from them again."
3,Misses the real problem and solution,"The only, effective way to reject socialism is by attacking it's fundamental philosophical ideas. That collectivism is good and the individual must be sacrificed for the ""good of the people"". Attacking a philosophy such as communism or socialism, because it is not ""practical"" is a contradiction and undercuts any argument against such a corrupt philosophy. These ideas are not good in theory but bad in practice. They are evil in theory and therefore evil in practice.I would like to also recommend Ayn Rand's, ""The Virtue of Selfishness"". This is THE work to understand Man's Individual Rights based on His Rational Nature. It is from these fundamental Truths that the ONLY proper function of a legitimate government is derived - The protection of Individual Rights."
1,A must read for understanding pseudo-fascist libertarianism,"Von Hayek's concept of freedom is the right of the fist. If your not rich, you don't count. If you stand up for a better society, through a union or something else, you are a defender of atrocities by Hayeks account. How you ask, how could that be? Well according to this book, Any public insight in how the society should be run is wrong, and should be left to our bosses and other ""experts"" to decide. Hayek don't even consider that the worst offenders of freedom isn't the public, common man, but the corporations with their top down hierachy. The only people Hayek, Mises and all other libertarian thinkers serve is the elite!"
3,Excellent Points - Tough to read.,"The Road to Serfdom is an excellent book in that Hayek describes how socialism does not work. He does this very thoroughly with lots of examples and the first time reader might find himself (herself) switching political affiliations. It is, however, very difficult to read and very slow going. Patience is required to plow through this book."
5,agreed,"I agree this is a great book on the matter, however i do agree that the last 7 pages are.. well very odd for this person. If you have ever thought government planning for it's people is a good idea, or even want more reason why it's a bad idea, read this book, if you still think it's a good idea i don't know what to tell you."
4,Hayek Understands the Totalitarian Mind,"I would've given the book 5 stars had it not been for the last 7 pages of the book. Hayek is thorough in his dissection of the totalitarian mind and its support of monopoly and eugenics. Often, while reading, I felt he could've been dropped in to modern times and not have to change a word. A good book is entertaining- a GREAT book- holds the test of time in how the author's ideas remain true and proven. We are dreadfully close in 2009 to reviving failed ideas of the past. In regards to the last 7 pages, I was disappointed that Hayek agreed that there needed to be a world federation system. After piling on pages upon pages of how tyrants take root...I felt his support for a one-world federation was quite naive and absurd. Nearly as naive as the idealists he so accurately discredited. But this shouldn't sway anyone from reading such an insightful book."
3,Bloated,"The actual writing of the book is its major weakness. It seems that the author uses too many words to say things. Much like any book written by Ayn Rand, between 50-70% of the book could have been omitted with no major loss in content.Also: When talking about social theory, it is absolutely critical to back up general statements with specific examples. And this was not done to my satisfaction.Hayek's later book, ""The Fatal Conceit"" covered many of the same themes that were detailed in this book. For a more concise read, try that instead."
4,"Food for thoughts, not belief","Many call the book a gravestone of socialist thinking. I rather define it gravestone of socialist belief. In our times - times of free economy victory - we keep forgetting about ""socialist"" parts in modern social machine.For people who thinks about social architecture not in terms of ""triumph of the will"", but in terms of social reforms this book gives rare understanding of trivial fact : any society is built from real people."
5,Anti-Socialist,"This is a great book, very pro capitalist written in 1944. but applies alot today. It is a good book to read after reading marx."
4,Great book,"I think this book is a must read for anyone interested in the econopolitical impact of our politician's and leader's decisions. The book is a bit theoretical and difficult to follow with its British English and 1940s language. I really enjoyed the book. It had a lot to teach about economics, politics, and the relationship of the two."
3,The Road to Serfdom,"The book is great. It should be required reading. The problem I have is that it was advertised as a hardback but a paperback was sent.When I contacted Halfprice they said they'd refund my purchase, which they haven't done yet."
3,Stellar CD... not video TITLE,"In case you read nothing but Gregg's review... you'd think this was a music video or tape. NO. It is a CD. You can not judge Corey Hart's video's and decide to buy the CD. You have to like his music. At first he was a ''boytoy'' but his songs went deeper than that. And if you're going to judge this CD by two songs, then go ahead. It'd be stupid to do so, but this is Corey at his best. They weeded out all the mind-numbing songs and put forth his best songs from 5 or 6 albums onto this CD. If you like Never Surrender oo A little Love and you haven't heard the rest, you're sure to not be dissapointed!"
4,The best of his songs...from ballads to dance-like pop.,"As a fan of Corey's since the early eighties, it's nice to hear all my favorites put together in one CD. ""Everything in My Heart"" and ""Never Surrender"" will always be pure ""Corey."" My husband and I even used 'Everything' during our wedding reception! ;-) This CD will cover all the bases for someone looking for an easy-listening alternative. All I can ask now is...when's the next album due out Corey?"
5,Still ticking after all these years,"I've been enjoying my SD-9200 since 2001 and it plays as well today as the day I brought it home. It is built extremely well. I use it for both DVD's as well as music playback with DVD-audio and CD's. Not quite a universal player (no SACD), but very close to it. The quality is far and above 95% of what you will find on the shelves of most big box electronics stores. If you find one used (and not abused), it would be a great buy, even today."
1,Big disappointment.,"This player is the worst piece of eletronics I've ever laid hands on. The settings in the setup menu keep changing all on their own. Also, the video cuts out about a third of the way through about 2/3rds of my dvds. I consisder this player to be unusable."
3,Not the conventional remixes of D.M,"These remixes are quite bizarre. Not what I was used to hear from Depeche Mode's singles.I always considered the singles of Depeche Mode better than the albums. But this remix #2 of Dream On has not so much personality than the others.The four themes are tasteless, they don't add any innovation like the others two great single releases of Dream On, where the ""dance"" feeling is better than ever.These tracks were oriented for experimentation, if you are a D.M fan, get it, but if you are starting buying D.M. singles, weird releases or dance versions, avoid this one. Not the best of Depeche Mode's singles."
2,Review of Formal Semantics of Programming Languages,"I had to get this book for my advanced programming languages, While the content were well-placed , you always have to keep up with different notations that pop up now and then. If I didn't had to spend so much time understanding all the different symbols in book it would've been a very good book."
3,"the book looks good from the outside,but","the book looks good from the outside,but there are many underlines and highlights inside the book. I guess someone worked very hard on this book."
3,product picture is misleading,"Despite what the product picture indicates, Moog does not include the pinch bolt & nut in this package. A shame since the rest of the ball joint appears to be high quality. Now I have to either reuse the old hardware or visit the local dealership."
4,Great condition!,"I was very happy with the speed in which I received my book and the condition its in. Although I am unsure what to make of the black tape covering the fact that its a teachers edidtion - not sure what that means, but it works for what I need!"
3,Short and Enjoyable,"I recommend this book for anyone who has only a few minutes of reading time at different intervals. I enjoy reading these short, but very informative pieces, sometimes I only have a few minutes while waiting for an appointment and these seems to fill the void instead of starting another novel i know I will never have time to finish. I also find them good conversation starters and have encouraged others to read these pieces for a good friendly debate. My favorite piece is ""Who shot Johnny?"". This tragic, yet familiar story of a loss of innocence by a woman author who has overcome multiple odds against her really pulls at a readers heart strings and makes all Americans feel the problems which face inner city youth. The topics are very diverse and I think you will find something you like. I am buying the second volume and hope it will be as great as the first."
5,Good for writing practice,"The book has up to date stories about American, such as legal immigrant and education.It also provide a lot of questions for each article so you can measure your understanding about the article."
5,America Now: Short Readings from Recent Periodicals,"America Now: Short Readings from Recent Periodicalsvery good!!the book looks like new, so new.shipping fast.great!!!!"
4,Good for teaching high school,"These articles are great to use in the classroom, to spark discussions about current issues."
5,happy with the book,I ordered a book for school and it said about 3 weeks for delivery got it in no time.I was a little scared ordering a used book thinking it had missing pages or it was all written on. Nope not at all.I ordered it used and it looks brend new. No writing in it or anything.I am happy with it I will order from them again if they have whatI am in need of.Thank you so much for being prompt and being honest about your product.
4,Best Boy is a great film,"It is rare that I am able to find movies or doumentaries on individuals with mental retardation/intellectual disability. Actors may play a role in a movie about mental retardation, but it is not the same. I am a social worker, and I work with persons who have mental retardation. I showed this film to staff and to the people who provide homes to these persons (we refer to them as care providers), and they also said that they throughly enjoyed it. It is a little long, but definitely worth watching."
5,Rare and Wonderful Tai Chi form,A sharing of a Tai Chi form that is truly rare and barely known in the world today -- a real gem. A very comprehensive teaching of this form. Nicely and briefly explains some of the important roots and core principles of Tai Chi and even Taoism as well. One of my outstanding experiences of learning this form is the mandala-like feeling it generates through its relationship with all directions during the practice. John P. Milton presents this form in a very relaxed and comprehensive manner. Beautifully filmed in outdoor nature with good sound quality and enough close-up to clearly see the form.
4,"Good mystery, great insights into human behavior","I received this book after my mother finished it, over thirty years ago. Started reading it one night during my senior year in college, couldn't put it down, read it all by dawn.Well constructed whodunit, starts out with two seemingly unrelated investigations, then pulls them into one. But, that isn't all there is to it. The protagonist is a man 5'3"" tall, and you see the world through the eyes of someone who is smaller than most men, and women, that he meets. I'm at the other end of height bell curve, but this made me really think about how the world looks at people are outside of physical norms. Tall and short are not so different as one might think.I've read some other books by Lawrence Sanders, this is by far my favorite."
1,not that good,"This book was recommended by a pediatric dietician. However, I did not find it very helpful, at all."
4,"a good ""read"" and an above-average book","Jim Garrison's book ""On The Trail Of The Assassins"" was one of two books used as the basis for Oliver Stone's movie ""JFK"" (the other was Kim Marrs' ""Crossfire""). On that basis alone, highly recommended (for it led to the JFK Act and the ARRB). That said, this is a very good but not a great book. I would put James DiEugenio's book ON Garrison ahead of this one. Still, a good ""read"" with some good moments.Vince Palamara"
4,THE ONLY TRUE INVESTIGATION OF JFK ASSASSINATION,"I have read this book several times..plus read many other theories, but I find that Mr. Garrison's investigation was the most thorough of any government investigation. He new where to look and who to look for, since he was right in the middle of the New Orleans scene, during the trying times of the Cuban problems. This book goes into great detail about the search and contacts of many of the witnesses, plus gives numerous cases where witnesses for the case were killed or never found. I am with Mr. Garrison, I believe the government knew about the assasination and were involved with it in covert operations. This book really elaborates on all the fine details of cover-up at it's best."
5,The definitive investigation,"I've never been a conspiracy buff. But I, as others who remember where we were the day JFK was shot, have always been interested in what really happened that day. When I found out this book existed, I read it. Jim Garrison knew, in the 60's, who shot the President and why, but he was unable, due to political and media pressure, to lay it before the public. He presents his well researched case in this book, clearly and concisely. When I saw the film, JFK, it wasn't clear to me why he prosecuted Clay Shaw. Here Garrison gives all the background material to make it all clear. Excellent job. It's too bad he didn't get the recognition he deserved."
1,"Oh, give me a break!","Hey folks, this is a very interesting read. But pay it no more creedence than you would any other work of fiction. I give this book one star, not because of it's lackluster showmanship, but rather that it masquerades as the truth that it is clearly not. Garrison relies heavily on evidence that has been discounted, witnesses that have been shown to be uncredible, and enough hearsay to drown a fish. The problem with this book is that people read it and think that it is in some way a definitive source on the Kennedy assassination. It is most certainly not, you would be well advised to do more research on the subject before taking this work of fiction at face value. An excellent suggestion is the highly researched book Case Closed, by Gerald Posner, who took the time to check his sources. Posner also spends a good deal of time addressing Garrison's, as well as other conspiracy theorist's, ""evidence."""
2,Nuttery Kookery,"Really, this is for the unhinged, hate-America crowd. I give it two stars because it was entertaining enough to read a half dozen times over the years--but this is a book that brings to mind the line about Capt. Queeg, He is a freudian delight, he crawls with clues. Poor Garrison yawps and waves his arms in a disturbing manner and howls of a conspiracy for several hundred pages--and proves no such thing. What he omits would fill twenty-plus volumes--and does: the Warren Commission, whose let's-get-to-the-conclusion-LBJ-wanted report is flawed but gets to the heart of it: Oswald had the means, motive, and opportunity. If you are serious about this business and want to see the REAL Garrison, please read the Lambert (False Witness), Bremer (The Garrison Case), and especially the Kirkwood (American Grotesque) books on Jim's case (all available on Amazon.com). If you can read them and still think of all doubters of the doubters as CIA plants, well...."
2,WARNING: Do not read this book until after False Witness,"Take this all with a grain of salt. A thorough investigation does not bear out what Mr. Garrison says. In fact, he contradicts himself in this book many times. Oliver Stone was duped."
4,Advisors don't necessarily lead perfect lives,"THE ART OF LOVE (Sztuka Kochania) is a satire about sex therapists and popular newspaper advice columnists. A young woman asks an advice columnist if her fiance is the right man for her, and should she get married to him. She follows the doctor's advice and abruptly halts her wedding right at the altar. When the distraught woman then seeks follow up help from the doctor, we discover that even the most trusted moral advisors don't necessarily lead perfect lives themselves, and can lack the high ideals they tell their readers to follow.The movie looks like it was produced in the 1980's, with the older clothing and hair styles, but it's humor is timeless. Dealing with sexual issues, the film falls just short of being too vulgar, which is, of course, a matter of one's personal tastes, and sexual humor in American movies like this one usually earn an ""R"" rating."
4,MUSICAL77,The CD is in excellent condition. It contains the original version as well as about 2 remixes. I bought the CD for the original version of the song and was put off when I popped it in the CD and the remix came on but I kept listening and it did have the version I like.
5,APC Smart UPS 1500VA Replacement battery,"The American replacement battery was an exact replacement to my old APC battery, but was much cheaper in price at Amazon. It went in easily, and it works perfectly. I made sure to allow it to fully charge overnight though, as per instructions, before I started plugging in my devices. I have had no problem with it whatsoever, and it always passes the automatic self-test with flying colors. I highly recommend this product."
4,RBC7 Battery from American Battery Co,"So far, the battery is working great. Unlike some of the comments, the pull tab was on the correct end of the battery. I performed a load test after fully charging the battery by disconnecting the ac power. I calcuated it should take about 18 minutes for the battery to drop to 15% capacity with my load. The battery dropped to 15% capacity after 17 1/2 minutes. The real test is in how long the battery lasts, but everything is working fine at present."
5,"Excellent unit, fair price, great shipping and packing.","I've used American Battery before and this unit appears to be as solid as the last one. They ship promptly and pack well and the units seem to last as long, if not longer, than the factory originals."
5,"Perfect replacement, and significant savings","I purchased this battery for my APC 1400 SmartUPS. In the past, I have bought from a local battery manufacturer. However, the cost of this battery was $20 cheaper, and the shipping was free with my Prime account. Add the convenience of having it delivered to my door, and it is a much better option. Final point - when I buy the replacement cells locally, I get two individual batteries, and then I have to fix them together and add the terminals from the old batteries. This unit came with the cells already configured and new terminals attached. Great product!"
1,Manufactured When the Dead Sea Was Only Sick,"I didn't really believe a company like Amazon would send me a product like a battery that is almost a year and a half old! Today is May 31, 2011 and the dates on the batteries are January 12, 2010. Not returnable either so I am stuck with it. Very funny when I click on return... says I can dispose of it. You're taking a risk buying this thing."
5,AMAZING VOLUME BY THE PLANET'S TOP EXPERTS!,"The North American Menopause Society has recently published Menopause Practice: A Clinician's Guide which is an amazing compilation of up-to-date, state-of-the-art information about a complicated subject that this Society and its members have reduced to a highly readable text.

4,"Pleasant, Pleasing, Good Read","I enjoyed reading this book and reading about what happen to the crew, Topaz, Keisha, Jade and Nina. I really enjoyed this book and the outcome of its characters. Topaz is still up to her tricks but then again she is being Topaz. I would love to find out if Jade evers finds out that Ninas' baby is her husband Sean, and if she does find out does she stay with him or leave the marriage... Good read"
1,an affair to forget,"Maybe I set the bar too high but I cannot understand the hype about A Chocolate Affair. The book seems to be about...what is this book supposed to be about? The back of the book reads like it's a juicy ""sister friend"" book but the words between leaves much to be desired. I do agree with others who recommend reading Chocolate Star so that one can become familiar with the characters but I cannot say that I would recommend this book at all. There is more name dropping than plot, no kind of character developement and the writing just seems a bit dry. There are times that I found myself rushing through the page in an attempt to get to a better part.If you are truly in need of boring yourself or just want to see what's next for Topaz and the gang then get a copy from the library."
4,"Creeping, Sleeping , and Secrets","A Chocolate Affair is certainly one I would recommend. Having read Chocolate Star I was quite excited and anxious to see what was going to be up. I enjoyed reading each of the sistah parts as it related to the novel . Keisha, Topaz, Nina, and Jade,eached shared there relationships. I was quite amazed with the creeping, sleeping, secrets. No I am not telling who was creeping , why, and what the secrets were. I kept wondering if the secrets were going to be revealed.When I got to the end I thought ooh there must me a sequel because there is some unfinished businesses . Yes Keisha and Eric were on the right track with the suspicions. Just when you think you have want you really want will trouble find them?"
2,Glitz and Glam and more Perfect People and Greeennn,"If Sheila Copeland's character's or books could be described with two words they'd be ""Green Perfection"". These people are unrealistically wealthy and perfect. With minor family problems and hidden agendas. All of them are just so irresistable and why doesn't Sheila find another color other than keep mentioning how much Green the main character wears. We get it Sheila...All of your character's are rich, talented and beautiful with little imperfections and minor character flaws. Give me something a little more believeable next time."
2,Rather empty,"Maybe I'm just not feeling it, but I don't understand what all the raves are about. I read Chocolate Star, which wouldn't have been bad if it was written better. The author mercifully cut back on the brand names and food descriptions (or maybe this time she received better editing), but the story line here was very thin. It essentially resolved around setting up The Incident between Topaz and Sean, and then its aftermath, which was a cinch to predict. Apparently, with the cliffhanger ending, the author intends to publish a series a la E. Lynn Harris. I'm glad to see that so many are eagerly awaiting the next installment, but I won't be reading it."
4,Scandalous,My advice to anyone who is thinking about purchasing this book is to read Chocolate Star first. This is a sequel to the book Chocolate Star. It flows better if you have an understanding of the characters from the first book. If you have read Chocolate Star and there has been some time delay please read it again.I thought the book was sizzling. There are a lot of secrets and changes among the characters. It is a very good easy read. I like the sisterhood connection. I thought it to be realistic. It shows you that you can have very good friends with some significant flaws but you love them very much in spite of these flaws.
4,GOOD,"At first I didn't wanna read the book, because it was kinda slow in the beginning. But once I got into it, I liked it. It kept me interested and I was just itching for the sequel at the end. This is a good read."
4,An array of African American women,"I didn't realize that this was a part 2. This was the first book I've read by this author, and I liked the ladies, 4 friends with secrets, ambition, turmoil, and you know we all suffer in love at some point. God's presence in this book is outstanding, I also love the feisty side. Entertaining and amusing looking forward to reading part 1 and part 3."
4,"Good book, but...","This is a good reference book for anyone in the linguistics field, but unfortunately my order got lost in the mail."
1,not to good,yo what this is sir smokealot hittn you up at krdo radio 105fm on yo dizial peace it is wack keep it real in 2000!
1,Save your money...,Someone else recommended a book on SPAM in lieu of this junk. I totally agree. The book is being promoted across the internet via irrelevant posts to private discussion groups by spammers. I read it. Don't waste your time or money. I gave it 1 star only because no negative numbers were available in the rating box.
5,Coolest Book on Hottest Topic,"COOLEST BOOK ON HOTTEST TOPICSThe derisive living truth, escapades, eccentricity, idioms, life"
2,"Confusing, poorly written","Part ONE provides a good base for the material to be covered later and chapters 9 and 10 on bonds and bond portfolios are decent (although the explanation of duration and horizon analysis could use some work). The latter half of chapter 6 and all of chapter 7 are horribly written. My professor's lectures on this material weren't really driving the point home, so I decided to read chapters 6 and 7 hoping to gain some insight and clarification. I'm not having much luck. It's going to take a lot of re-reading and memorization of these concepts before they start to click."
4,battery replacement,"I gave it 4 stars as it does not ADD anything MORE than the original battery and I do not give 5 stars unless the product goes above and beyond, or unless there is a distinct differentiator for a product. In this case, the battery works as advertised, arrived in the time expected, for the price expected. And performs as advertised. A clear 4 star effort. I would/will buy again; it has been installed and working for a few weeks now, no worries or startup issues. Powerchute had to be reinstalled as once it looses the connection to the battery, it does not recognise a new battery. But that was a simple uninstall and reinstall of Powerchute, which maintained all history data. If you want the original equipment for your Back-UPS or UPS, this is it."
1,does not hold a charge. don't waste $90 like I did!!!,"It's identical to the original battery and it fitted in just like it should; however, it does not hold a charge. I'm guessing that the battery was left on the shelves for too long before it's sold. Amazon.com does not accept return or exchange on batteries. I wasted $90 thought that I saved money; $90 down the drain. :("
4,Good customer service,"The product is great and the customer service was as well, I would definitley order again."
4,One slick sister in the downtempo family,"OK, what I understand about the roots of bossa nova can't even fill this sentence, but I do know that this modern organic-electronic hybrid is one slick sister in the downtempo family. It's the soul of the sound wielded to current studio production technique, a meatier and lively reinterpretation for dance crowd downtimes.Italian label Scehma culls tracks worldwide to do all this, and they're absolutely on point. The spirited drum loops of S'Tone Inc ""Rendezvous a Minuit"" stand out immediately, matched by the glistening sheen of German stars Jazzanova on ""Fedime's Flight."" Shuffle in some French fluff on Streetlife Originals ""A Sidewalk Stories"" and a handful of tropicalia jams like Metrophonics ""Latin Racer,"" and what results is cocktail music with kick. Pop on the player and proceed to the patio, immediately."
3,Hey another M4 wow,"This magazine isn't bad, it articles are usually well written and the photos are usually quite good. The problem I have with it is every issue seems identical to the one before it. You can only look at the newest and best M4 clone so many times before it becomes just the same old news."
2,NIce magazine Poor service,"This is a good Magazine for variations fo AR-15 and the latest toys,whistles and gadgets to come in the market. But my overall trouble with this is that I paid for a year subscription and only recieved 4 issues period. I waited about 4 months to get my 1st issue and they only 3 more the whole year. Poor service indeed as I had to go to hoops inquiring about this issue with Amazon and the publisher which failed as I emailed and called. Why even have to go through that, but then again they had my money already which says it all!!!!"
2,Guns & Weapons for Law Enforcement,"From continued purchases at the newsstand I know this magazine covers my primary interests, however, one should live long enough to actually receive their first issue through the Amazon subscription service. Twelve to sixteen weeks to get your first issue is absolute incompetence on someone's part. You add a name to the subscription mailing service and mail the damn thing - what could possibly delay it four months except incompetence? I note, however, that my credit card was charged immediately for something I may, repeat may, receive in about four months. I'm very unhappy with this service, or should I say disservice!"
1,No Common Sense,"This magazine is a must have for all the Fascist fruit-cakes in la-la land. The February 2010 article by Donald J. Mihalek is a classic example. This nut-job advocates turning Police Departments into military counter-insurgency units to be deployed against the citizen population.The last time i checked this is still the U.S.A. and the Constitution is still in effect,well some what.Any police dept.stupid enough to implement this fruit cakes suggestions would find themselves sued into oblivion or wiped out in a matter of days by a very angry and armed population.Mihalek and his fellow kooks should immigrate to North Korea.I'm sure he will find North Korea more appealing.I'm forced to give this magazine one star,for laughs."
4,Good but wanted more,"This video is good and touches on a lot of different things regarding solo canoeing. Things from canoes, very basic paddle stokes, what to wear in differnt climates when canoeing and simple outfitting your canoe. But he only touches on these areas and would have liked much more detail and info. This video is like taking a beginners solo canoe class. It's great and fun but your ready for more. The video quality is excellent. I would recommend this video for anyone just starting out in canoeing regardless if solo or tandem."
2,Too big!!!!,Not sure why Larousse does this but their dictionary is so huge my middle school child can't take it to school. Their 'pocket' dictionary is a better fit in a backpack.
5,Great Dictionary,This was exactly what I was looking for and I got it at a steal of a deal price and love it.
3,Larousse is great---but,"This like all Larousse Dictionaries is great but unfortunately this one for a travel option it a little big. The similar one with only 80,000 entries travels better. Unfortunately, that does not easily found here-- but I suggest searching for the smaller if you plan to travel with it"
5,Given as a gift.,"To give a gift and be thanked for it a dozen times, must mean the person receiving the gift enjoys it. I will take that to be a 5 star rating."
3,Some annoying deficiencies,"This book has a couple of nice things going for it, as others have mentioned-- it's easy to read (good type size) and very lightweight/portable. Those are important features. I completely agree, however, with the reviewer who pointed out the incomplete verb conjugation in the back of the dictionary. Why bother with such a section if you're not going to be thorough or at least explain the reason for your omissions? A presentation like this could mess up a beginner. Also, there should be consistency between the Spanish/English and the English/Spanish sections. Don't define ""esposo"" as ""husband"" in the former and then only list ""marido"" as the word for ""husband"" in the latter. Why not put both ""esposo"" and ""marido"" with the entry for ""husband""? Such discrepancies point to sloppiness on the part of Larousse. There were probably multiple authors/editors working on this book and no one person ever bothered to ensure consistency."
5,Excellent quality for an excellent price,"This book has everything that you would want from a spanish dictionary. It has every definition you would want, short cultural notes that talk about American and spanish culture, and detailed info at the beginning of each section (spanish-english and english-spanish) that gives the reader good info about the opposite culture (assuming that a spanish-speaking person reads the spanish-english part and an english-speaking person reads the english-spanish part). If you are looking for a spanish dictionary get this one because it's loaded with info, it's compact, and it's one of the cheapest on amazon."
5,It's right on up there.,"With new bandmembers and a new sound to boot, the new album seems to stand out from the others, almost as if it was standing on the shoulders of giants. With more of a focus on ballads than rock tunes (I Can See A Liar and Put Your Money Where Yer Mouth Is are the only real rock sounds on here), and the definite trips outside of the boundaries of current pop music (Who Feels Love? and Roll It Over). But it's that new found love for balladry that puts this CD over the top. Ranging from Go Let It Out (in a sense) through Where Did It All Go Wrong, Sunday Morning Call, and Roll It Over. People who were fans of Whats The Story (Morning Glory) will fall in love with Standing On The Shoulder Of Giants."
3,Standing on the Shoulder of Giants,"Standing on the Shoulder of Giants being Oasis 3rd studio album and their 2000 release is an ok album but not nearly as good as either of their prior albums and especially if one compares it with their magnum opus ""(What's the Story) Morning Glory?"". Still there are some pretty good tracks, ""Who Feels Love?"" , ""Sunday Morning Call"" and ""Go Let It Out"" . The booklet is ok with easy to read lyrics, a list of additional muisicans and a collage of strange photos seemingly shot at random. 3/5."
5,Great Smelling,"Product smells wonderful, and nice and sudsey, and a little tip, Works great at cleaning wigs, and bringing them back to life"
3,Decent I Suppose,"While this book would prepare any student well enough for the AP Exam, I would recommend the Barrons AP Review Book as a far better resource. The Princeton Review treats the reader as a child, frequently trying to be funny and failing miserably, coming off as partronizing and condescending."
4,Cracking the AP World exam,"A good review book. I have urged all my AP students to buy it. We will use it to review for the exam in May.Gee...lucky I am over the age of 13. In fact, I am 53 years over that age....so I guess I can write a review."
2,Fragile Materials,The photos are ok but the plastic material will crash at the most minimum impact. If you are not one of those extra-cautious guys look the other way around. In my cammera the faceplate was broken when falling at a height of 3-4 inches...
5,Absolutely Bone Chilling,"Amazon recommended this to me since I like scary movies and after reading the description online I didn't think much since it was only 32 minutes long. But I decided to give it a shot anyways. This movie is scary as hell. 15 minutes into the flick hearing Scott Graham talk about the mirror's violent and haunted past already had me creeped out. There's no blood or guts, but the film works in a sort of Blair Witch type scary in the sense that it's what u don't see that is truly terrifying. Highly recommended."
3,Shipshape and Unsurprising,"Middling collection of Chinese Buddhist poems; I didn't feel that there were any hidden gems here, not on the level of Han Shan.The original Chinese text accompanies the translations, however, which is something that I find pleasing, and presumably you will too, if you are into the language."
5,"The ""Orient in London""","Exquisite free flowing designs and colours. Stunning imagery every page a visual feast, a pure delight. Carolinda Tolstoy's work is both exciting and sincere,she rightly deserves the recognition that her art has been given by Professor Ernst J. Grube president of the East West Arts Foundation New York. ""Countess Tolstoy is undoubtedly the major contempory representative of a considerable English 'Orientalist' tradition."""
2,Shipped with missing part,"Re: order sold by one way pet llc.Comfy perch cross med. 25"" was missing one of the four caps which are necessary for instillation.Am having an extreamly difficult time contacting them to get the missing part. The only answer I am getting is :return the item, which is rediculous as all I need is One cap. Actually talking to someone which would solve the problem seems to be impossible."
1,Not Even The S.O.S.,"It's a shame that Sexy Money was so ill-recieved. The Busters have been overly defending their ska roots ever since, reluctant to venture from no-soul ""toaster's"" ska. This album and their last, Make a Move, is just more of the same ol'. Check out Stompede, however, a late-career gem."
4,Sub Down - My Opionion,"one of the better sub thrillers around.. i would compare it to ""the hunt for red october"" for all the excitement of an undersea high-tech adventure,this should end up being a classic buy for your collection..well worth the purchase price.."
1,"Ordered in early December, Allegedly the First Issue Will Come in March!","I know that magazine subscriptions can take a long time to ""cycle in"", but this is ridiculous. Ordered for Christmas, may arrive by Easter. I understand that magazines have a hard time competing with the internet, but maybe this is one reason why."
5,Tag Heuer Watch Purchase,"This was a completely satisfactory purchase. The watch, advertised as used, was brand new, only had been returned to purchaser for a different model. All original packaging was included, it was securely wrapped and delivered in a timely manner. A trememdous buy, and further promotes my faith in Amazon!"
2,Read the original 'Tomboy Bride' - skip this,Harriet Backus's 'Tomboy Bride' is a classic - Read it and skip Duane Smith's commentary - repetitous and adds very little worthwhile new inormation.
4,Reflections on Tomboy Bride,"While this book was in no way as interesting as Tomboy Bride, it still brought further revelations about Harriet's interactions with the other mining families in their tiny community. It is a good, but not great, backward glance."
4,Another Great Stout-Pritchard Collaboration,"I've wondered whether Michael Pritchard and Rex Stout ever met.He interprets Stout's work with such insight and feeling. In this book, Stout confronts another of the 1950s institutions: the advertising business and the ""big contest"" approach to promoting products.An advertising firm runs a million-dollar contest to promote perfume. The finalists have been asked to determine which perfume-using historical figure is depicted in some rhymes. The writer of the rhymes teases the finalists by flashing the answers, and is later found dead.It's historically interesting to note that, strictly speaking, Stout anticipated the quiz show scandals a few years after this story's time (1955). To learn more about this, get the wonderful DVD ""Quiz Show,"" which deconstructs this era with great insight and empathy.But man, that Michael Pritchard. I have some Nero Wolfes read by others, but Pritchard got it right for sure."

4,La búsqueda personal,"Aunque no es el mejor de los libros de Coelho, no deja de ser una hermosa lectura del encuentro con el yo. A este estupendo autor también hay que leerlo entre líneas, y entender que él disfraza con personajes y situaciones que van de la ficción a la realidad, moralejas para la vida. Creo que vale la pena leerlo. Se puede convertir en un libro ideal para momentos de espera. Yo me leído todos los libros disponibles en español de Paulo, y sí lo recomiendo."
5,Beautiful book,Este es uno de los libros más hermosos que he leído en todo mi vida. Es bien dfícil parar cuando uno lo comienza. Es excelente! I just loved this book! I started reading it one night and I just could not stop reading. I enjoyed every part of it and could read it over and over again.
3,if you like paulo read it...,"this is the worst book by paulo. If there's anything not great on his writtings... it is anot entertainig at all, and talks about a coup[le thats not interesting either... the onl;y amazing thing i sto get to know about the sanctuary in lourdes and about common peoiple.. i would not resd it before the alchemist, veronoca decides to die, the pilgrimage or the fifth mountain."
5,Un encuentro con el amor,"Este libro a mi me pareció excelente, ya que en el puedes encontrar los miedos y circunstancias que en ocasiones te limitan para amar. Es una hermosa historia de amor, llena de búsqueda para la aceptación del amor y el vencimiento a los temores personales."
3,Demasiado intenso.,"Entiendo que el mensaje principal de este libro es ayudarnos a entender el lado femenino de Dios. Desafortunadamente pienso que este libro debería de venir con una advertencia acerca de su alto contenido religioso para las personas que no estamos tan adentradas en la religión.Al igual que en ""El Alquimista"" este libro empieza bien y termina viajandose, hablando de cosas surrealistas como hablar ""el lenguaje de los ángeles"".A mitad del libro todavía no estaba segura a donde iba la historia exactamente, era al mismo tiempo una historia de amor o de como un creyente se encontró a si mismo y ayudo a una mujer a encontrarse.Menciona historias como de Bernardette, unos monos y Santa Teresa. Pareciera que este autor hizo su tarea de Investigacion y no podía esperar para contarnos lo que aprendió.Rezando en la lluvia a media noche, rezando incado en la nieve, andar como nómada de lugár en lugar por la religión es el mejor ejemplo del fanatismo.No me pareció un gran libro."
2,Falta mover las emociones,"Definitivamente el arte de mover al corazon humano con este libro no se encuentra, ni tampoco siquiera una historia interesante, de hecho este libro en lo personal no me afecto en nada. Es un libro sin contenido, y aunque me encanta El Alquimista, del mismo autor, este libro no lo puedo recomendar para nada."
1,A poor mixture of soap opera and mystic mumbo-jumbo,"This literary abomination is a mixture of soap opera (a lot of it)and pseudo-mystical utterances, combined to produce a revolting after-taste of profound phoniness. What do you think of a ""novel"" in which the words ""God"" and Love"" appear at the rate of at one or two per page? If yu can stand it, by all means, buy it, read it and (hopefully) forget it. But be warned that this book is for a wide audience with a definite religious ideology and who do not seem to care about the quality of what they read."
2,Couldn't Pick It Up ....,"The characters are wishy-washy & boring. The story doesn't flow very well... kinda had to force myself through the part that I did read.One day, I'll force myself to finish it.One day."
2,This book was okay but...,"This book had some helpful information in it. However, if you really want a great book on bad bosses buy The bully at Work by Gary and Ruth Namie."
1,non-compliance,"This product never came, thank you know that happened because if he was charged to my credit card. I asked other 3 products from different vendors and they came"
4,Keeping children safe & strong,"This is a great book to use with children to teach them that it is OK to tell someone, even an adult, what you like/dislike and how you feel. Too many times, children are taught that they should not talk back to adults, that adults know best. Yet, in this story, Sara's mother encourages her to tell Jack, an adult Sara likes to joke with, how she really feels and that it is OK to define her personal space. The book encourages children to think about what makes them feel comfortable/uncomfortable and how to put those feelings into words that convey those feelings to others. In a time of increasing violence against children, this book can help children learn to stand up for themselves in positive, assertive ways."
3,The Spirit of WWII,"This volume of the Spirit Archives covers July to December, 1943. Will Eisner was in the Army at the time, so the comic was written and drawn by other people. It was a decent adventure strip during this time period, but not nearly as good as when Eisner was doing the strip himself."
3,Decent Replacement Material,"Lou Fine and the others responsible for ""ghosting"" The Spirit while Eisner was away are beginning to hit their stride with collection. Enjoyable reading, but where they really fall down are the plots. It's hard to shoehorn a story into a limited number of pages. Lets not forget these were not full fledged comics but a Sunday Newspaper supplement. Most of these stories have holes in them you can drive a truck through and I personally could've skipped the propaganda at the end of some of them as well BUT the country was at war and the verdict was still in doubt. Think of this as a place holder volume and you'll be fine.Worf"
1,The truth about Michael Leyton,"For a critical review of this book and of the whole of Leyton's work you may profitably read'A Critique of Leyton's Theory of Perception and Cognition. Review of Symmetry, Causality, Mind, by Michael Leyton.'by Hendrickx M. and Wagemans J. Journal of Mathematical Psychology, Volume 43, Number 2, June 1999, pp. 314-345.It may save you a lot of money. If you can't find the paper just contact me at marcel.hendrickx@chello.be . I'll be glad to inform you."
3,Incredible,"The ideas held within this book are very astounding. There appear to be a wide array of different applications in many fields for some of his theories. Unfortunately, his pedantic writing style and amazing overuse of seemingly meaningless and unneccesarily long words makes it very difficult to read. If you are looking to get a reasonably good understanding of the book, I would suggest that you find some sort of synopsis or abridged version. It is a pain to wade through some of the more tedious recursive definitions and principles. I imagine though that, if you could sift through and find the underlying meaning, you would be left with a great wealth of knowledge about these many subjects."
4,powerful!,"this book is not only a great conversation starter, but offers tremendous insight into what a child feels in a situation not of his/her own doing. the impact of culture in the lives of children must be further investigated and the stories these children have to tell is well worth hearing. i HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone who is willing to think a little. Jaiya John has bright future and a powerful journey ahead of him!"
4,Engaging and Insightful,"Though sometimes challenging in the flow and chronology of events, Black Baby White Hands sheds light on the possible consequences of transracial adoptions to both parent and child. Even so, the redeeming factor that gives the narrative credence is the LOVE afforded the writer from his adoptive parents from the crib to the present(I think, if the relationship is ongoing). The adpotive parents taught the author how to love; hence, he could readily accept and envelope his biological family. Had he been denied unflinching love as a child, there might have been bitterness and resentment toward the biological parents for their absence in his life. The reader meets an emotional healthy person who successfully evolves from a darkness into the light of love. I better understand now why many object to transracial adoption as a viable option for African American children."
1,What a disappointment!,"I ordered this video as a cultural reference for my classroom. It was a shock to see nudity and references to pornography on the video after reading the description on Amazon.com. Something entitled ""The Japanese Sounds of Music"" and having photos of traditional Japanese musicians and dancers clearly displayed on the cover implies a safe cultural exploration for students. I am grateful that I have the good sense to preview the few videos I use in teaching prior to showing them to teenagers in a classroom! The company should be forced to change the description as well as the cover to properly reflect the content. I would've awared NO stars out of 5 if the review process would accept it!"
4,Value for money,"This camera is reasonably priced and i have definetly gotten my moneys worth since i purchased it a couple of months ago. The resoloution is quite good and the camera functions well in general. For amature photographers this camera is an excellent option. It is not too complicated to use, has plenty of features and good battery life. Somebody looking to take profetional quality photographs may want to look for a more advanced camera. In general this camera is great for the average photographer and i do not regret purchasing it. Of my three digital cameras that i own (two of them being the fuji finepix 4700 and ricoh RDC 7) this one is definetly my favourite."
5,mmmmmm. yummy.,"I am a very finicky cat, but triumph trout is one of my favorite dinners. I especially enjoy it after a hard day of work. -VJM"
3,Very much typical of it's type but not bad,"I got my copy of ""Arctic Blast"" in a Wal-Mart $5.00 bin so it wasn't a major investment. Most of the other reviews have given the standard information and I think they are accurate. The special effects are ok; fog isn't as scary as flooding water, or lava etc. but the movie does hold your attention while it goes through the standard low budget complications these movies share. One thing nice about it; it's filmed in Tasmania and Australia so the scenery being frozen is different. There are a few standard disaster around the planet shots, Big Ben, Golden Gate, etc. but most of the location work is a plus for being a bit different. I will watch it again some night when I can use a little arm chair adventure."
3,arctic blast,arctic blast is not great movie by no means but its not a bad movie it is enjoyable so i gave this movie a 3 star i still like it if you like this kind of movies you should buy it its worth the money.
2,BORE BLAST,"I have friends in Australia..and I have Canadian relatives.. but when I saw this was a Canadian/Australian co production, I said ""Oh lord!""..and I was right.. This movie was weak..acting, story, direction..everything was bland and cheesy. It's less than a made for tv movie in the U.S... The film isn't even up to made for tv in Canada standards. I would go into greater detail, but trust me, just avoid it.. I got it for $1.. I still over paid.."
5,Mindblowing,"Suicide are the main reason why I can't listen to Hip-Hop. After hearing Vega on the mic, I'm not capable going into sampling with a spokenword guy. One may say, this comparison ist not o.k., Hip-Hop is another pair of shoes, well I agree with. But it doesen't change the thing for me. Vega is just lightyears more original. Put me down. I got this stuff."
1,I could not believe how bad this was,"I have recently heard ""Girl"" on Sirius radio and I really like it and I was so shocked to see it was Suicide !! I saw them open for The Cars in the early 80's and I have never seen food thrown at a band before that night and not since. I also have never heard a band booed off the stage either, until that night. The show and music was horrible !!I will say, almost 30 years later, my tastes have changed and I have warmed to Suicide, this album has a few songs that grow on you but I stick to what I said earlier, HORRIBLE !!"
1,Are you kidding?,"Im sorry, but this is not entertaining music, infact its very very annoying to the ears...i can even recall the misfits early demo stuff having an entertaning synth sound in there music( and that was just plain laughable, but wasnt terrible). This music however, is not ""music"", and anyone who can actually sit down and listen to this all the way through and try to tell me that I dont get the ""artistic value"".......well......to them i say, Enjoy sniffing your own farts the rest of your lifeAnd for the many reviews that say this it is ""scarrRrrRRrRy"" to listen to.. hmm......wow...i guess ill leave that one up to you"
5,First Album,"For a band that really had no other electro-punk influences to draw from at the time of it's release, this album proves that they were WAY ahead of their time. Always minimalistic and staggering in its approach, the album's power derives mainly from trance-inducing and repetitive keyboards from Marty Rev and unpredictable, howling vocals from Alan Vega. Not bad sounds coming from what mainly started with a broken down Farfisa organ and cheap-o drum machine. And tracks like ""Ghost Rider"" and ""Frankie Teardrop"" have proved to be timeless and greatly influencial even by today's standards. The live tracks taken from different shows of the era only prove how often controversial and violent this kind of music was taking it's only influences from the doomed and claustrophobic climate of the late 1970's in NYC. HIGHLY recommended and a leader of the genre."
4,Ahead of their time -- maybe ahead of ours too,"There is now a flourishing synthpunk underground, but the sound invented by Suicide, Metal Urbain, and a few other '70s pioneers was scorned and ignored for years. Dreamy, threatening tracks like ""Ghost Rider"" and ""Frankie Teardrop"" foreshadow everything from Bauhaus to psychedelic trance. But at their heart, the songs throb with pure rock-n-roll violence."
5,"""Yeah keep them dreams burnin babe....forever""","Few bands that can be so scary as this one are so damn funny too at times (unintentional?). With super-repetitive, trance-inducing synth-lines backing the possessed echoing vocals, I don't know of anything like it. It feels like a euphoric nightmare at times, full of the menace and hooks. Good for late night head trips..."
5,Great classic album,Suicide's debut album still sounds relevant and fresh today. It's great to hear electronic music that still has grit and soul. Many newer artist could learn a thing or two from this album
4,Why have'nt they made it big yet?,"Tina is one of those bands that have been around for so long is still waiting for the recognition they deserve. Their last album, however, was maybe a td bit better than this one. 'Salvation' was a great album all around. This one is great too, but it does not seem to be as consistent. Still, check out the both of them and whatever you do, see them live. Nothing is better than that."
3,B-Effort from the B-Sides,"Although this likely to draw the fire of legions of fellow Tina and the B-Sides fans, I found this album to be a real let-down after ""Salvation."" There are a few gems on the album, but it's a B effort from the B-Sides. The stylistic departure is a walk on the weird side -- and reminds me of REM's style stumbles a couple of years ago. Stick with the older albums. This one is a tough listen."
1,"Monster Garage Rock Crawler ""DVD""","This is not a DVD at all, but some special format for a Video Now Player. It will not play in a regular DVD machine. Thankfully, the seller agreed to let me return the product, even though the shrink wrap had been removed. The listing in Amazon for this product should be changed because it is false advertisement - something one doesn't expect from Amazon!!"
2,Not a hoot,"Hoot Gibson stars in a lame love story combined with a convoluted crime involving some big city (NYC or Chicago are both referred) bank robbers. One of the robbers buys a ranch in Arizona for his sister for unknown reason except perhaps so his boss can use her to carry the hot loot to Arizona. Five or six months later the gang appears in Arizona in big touring cars and wants the hot money. They kidnap the sister and shoot her brother. The ranch hands ride to the rescue and the gangsters are ambushed and killed or captured. Everyone lives happily ever after. Ho Hum. Regarding the Alpha Video DVD, the source 16mm print was in good condition and there are few lines, glitches or missing frames. Contrast is slightly light. I rate it 7.5 out of ten which for Alpha is great. The script is pedestrian at best and the action is slow even for a 52-minute film. There are many other B-westerns worth watching before wasting time on this, even if you give a hoot for Hoot."
4,Interesting way to get started,This book is easy to read. This book takes you through the evolution of computers so that you really understand the why's and how's of today's systems. Good for a wide variety of novice uers.
2,MMMKAY,"I bought these socks for a Halloween vb tourny. I was disappointed when I got them bc they weren't what I expected. The vb socks I usually wear are thinner and these are very thick. The thing I didn't like the most about them, is that you can't see from the picture, but the socks themselves have a sort of ribbing to them- so you see the lines of the material and the lines of the web- not as a clean of a look as I got from the picture. Also, the inside has all the extra stitching hanging out. I got the blue ones b/c my vb shoes are white and blue, and someone jokingly asked if the webs were my vericose veins!! lol Anyways, great sock as far as socks go, but for vb, not for me personally. Plus, the shipping prices were pricey for shipping socks."
