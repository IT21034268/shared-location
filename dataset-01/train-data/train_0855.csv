4,INsane Music,"This album by Unsane is great, it has great riffs, plenty of low and and great drumming and lyrics. Fans of hard music will surely love this album."
5,Buy this CD,"because perhaps the most amazing stuff on the album is the three songs by Jeff Beck and Eric Clacton (as introduced by John Cleese). ""Cause We've Ended as Lovers"" is just incredible duet work -- there isn't one wasted note in the song."
5,Best Live album I've ever had!,This is the best LIve album EVER!I had this on vinyl and recorded it onto a cassette so that I could listen to it in my car!Years later and I could only find it on here for $88!!! Crazy! Now I wish I had held on to it.
1,I Hate This Recording: Get the Denon,"The sound quality between this Harmonia Mundi recording, and the Denon, is night and day. I feel as though it's my duty to recommend that you steer clear of this and just go for the Denon and the BIS, both of which complement each other. My major complaint here is the recording of the 'Sixxen' instrument: it sounds clangy and cheap. The Denon eliminates the issue."
1,disappointing,"Very disappointing movie. I bought this movie. When you watch a movie you like to believe some of the things that are happening can really happen in your life or someones. It doesn't happen. Trust me, rent this movie so you can give it back."
4,Wonderful movie!,I forgot how great this movie is....innocent and cleaver! I am so happy to have found it again and share it with my family!
4,Completely underated!,"This movie is one of the best ""love stories"" of the 90's. It has both heart, and intelligence. Davis and Keaton have real chemistry on screen. The fact that they are both writers really adds to the humor as they tear into each other through their respective candidates speeches. This movie just feels real. The little nuances (necisito una toalla) really add depth to the movie and the characters. I own this movie,and really wish they would hurry up and release it on DVD. My VHS copy is starting to get a little thin and grainy from so many plays... Has anyone else noticed that they changed the cover art almost immediately after releasing the VHS version?Bonus* The soundtrack is great too. ""Sorry seems to be the hardest word"" really adds a melancholy tone right after the climax of the film--talk about memorable moments..."
4,speechless,"thoroughly enjoyed this movie when i saw it on tv recently that's why i bought itregards, Bernie W N"
3,High Order Debacle,"SPEECHLESS is a cinematic debacle of the highest order. It is truly a shame when an ensemble of talent cannot bring the final artistic product to fruition. I do not blame Keaton or Davis. Director Don Underwood did the best with what he had to work with. The fly in the ointment here is writer Robert King. His basic plot and premise are fine but his script lacks the most rudimentary elements of providing good coherent and captivating dialogue. His script is blatantly bland and becomes annoying as the film progresses. Christopher Reeve, who should have been a strong peripheral yet pivotal character, looks extremely awkward delivering his lines. Bonnie Bedelia, a fine actress, also comes out less then her potential. This film is a real lost opportunity."
3,Speechless..Well Spoken Movie.,"An oddity of sorts because you have the two actors who played Batman and Superman in one movie (Micheal Keaton and Christopher Reeve respectively). With that aside, SPEECHLESS delivers on the grounds of a decent romantic/screwball comedy. Keaton and Geena Davis play speechwriters for rival candidates in a New Mexico senatorial campaign who meet and fall in love under unusual circumstances. They must keep their love alive when the campaign becomes intense and they must keep their loyalty to their respective candidates. Typical light characters played by Keaton and Davis and Christopher Reeve thrown into the mix as an old boyfriend of Davis trying to revive the old relationship. Overall, solid entertainment that's unoffensive with snappy dialogue."
2,Not a great movie,"My friend and his hot air balloon were in this movie which is why I bought it, but I wouldn't consider it to be all that good of a movie."
5,why cant i watch this online?,"i love this movie and would love to be able to watch online, I agree that chemistry between Keaton and Davis is extrordinary and i love a ..You see Timmy..."
4,"Very pretty and light, hard to put in","I love the look of these graceful spirals, but it's a little tricky figuring out how to get them through the piercing. That's the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. Once you do get them in, though, they're as light as air and very cute.The niobium kept my super-sensitive skin from getting irritated, which is a nice change for me. I rarely get to wear earrings because of that. Niobium is a great option for me, and the rainbow-effect Harry created is very pretty. I will be purchasing other Harry Mason designs in the future.(Copper is also hypo-allergenic, in case any readers out there are looking for more style choices.)"
4,Quality product!,"This was a great purchase for us! We use it as a toy box and it works well in this manner. Unfortunately, my daughter smashed her fingers in the drawer within five minutes of setting it up, but this was quickly remedied by taping towels on the back of the drawers to prevent them from closing completely. Overall, this is a great solution for a toy box and will serve us well in the years to come."
5,TOGETHER with CHOPINS EARLIER YEARS: GREAT SET!,"These two books by Opal Wheeler are ""must have"" classics for Chopin enthusiasts, as well as, music depts., music/piano teachers. If your a piano person, or just love a great story about a great person, this is a top intro about Chopin. You can also buy an accompany CD that takes this classic journey full-circle. GREAT!"
2,An introduction to Chopin for a 10 year old,"I made a mistake in my purchase on line as did not know this was a young childs book. (There were no notes at all by the seller to help) This publication seems to me to be written in fantasy, fairy tail form too rather than based on biographical facts. So I am not sure what use it is apart from its entertainment value.My copy is a musty 1960's vintage and was (at least to me) expensive at nearly $16 plus shipping.I contacted the seller about my dissatisfaction and received a rather hurt and almost rude reply back. So, I do not take a chance and buy books which have no basic accompanying notes anymore."
3,Wasn't exactly what I expected,"It came when I wanted it, but I thought that I could just slip a card inside of the pouch. I didn't realize that I needed to actually laminate the tag to seal it. I don't own a laminating machine, so I'm still trying to figure out how I'm going to do it without messing them up because I ordered exactly what I need."
4,Luggae tag pouches,"I liked the fact that they came promptly and when i did receive them instead of taking them to be laminated, when I put the luggage tag in it, I just had to use an iron at med high heat for few seconds to seal them. The loop itself was not ideal but it worked out well and I think my wedding guest will enjoy them!"
1,Tami G,not what I expected. Thought I would be able to slide a card or piece of paper right in there with people's names. You must have to use a laminating machine in order to make these work. Did not come with any instructions. Difficult to attach to a regular bag.
5,One of the most subtle French movie in several years,"The subject might seem uninteresting at first, but the drama is extremely well built, the action never goes slow. The young actors are excellent and editing is admirable."
5,Very good French movie about teenagers discovering love,"Very accurate and powerful movie of one of the most talented French director of the last decade. 3 teenagers discover love (gay and straight) in a little town in the south of France. Elodie BOUCHEZ who co-wan the first feminine interpretation prize at the 1998 Cannes festival is more than brilliant, really terrific !!!!! If you like good movies (not especially French ones...), go ahead and just enjoy it..."
5,"If you're looking for a powerful film, I recommend this.","Wild Reeds is about a group of teenagers learning to live during the war in Algeria in 1962 where many soldiers died, including Serge's brother. It also focuses on Franois. Although he has a girlfriend, he learns- after a brief relationship with Serge- of his sexuality.Sience events like this happen even today in any country, this film will give you the courage to except the world around you and most of all, except yourself."
3,"cute couple, unsatisfying ending","A great find if you're seeking an angst ridden drama about gay boys coming of age... Francois' heart wrenching plight to make Serge love him ..., but a very sexy scene in which Serge is very causal about 'things' made up for it. His lip smacking and lip licking moves were great. But, warning, the ending is *really* unsatisfying... proceed with caution."
3,Great if you like baseball,"I was surprised by all the baseball trivia in this movie, which was billed as being a time travel thriller. It has an interesting premise - a radio signal that travels through time and creates a ripple effect of parallel reality. Otherwise, it doesn't break a lot of new ground. It instead tries to be an edgier, more-adult-oriented version of Back to the Future. However, it plays with the butterfly effect a little more gracefully. Its cultural references are about as dated as those of Back to the Future, and they don't age very well. Even so, that's a very minor problem. As a thriller, it still has enough to excite."
5,GREAT,LOVE this movie!!!!! Best purchase from Amazon.com!!! This is such a great story line and it's nice to see a happy ending!!!!
4,Excellent Transfer of a Time Bending Movie,"This review is for the blu-ray transfer only, not the film itself. The blu-ray version of Frequency is excellent. Even though this is a mystery/drama where hi-def is not necessary, it is always a joy to see a movie in the best possible resolution, and this is it. Even night and indoor scenes look crisp. The colors are strong. The sound was also good, with one minor quibble--gunshots sound very weak in a couple of scenes, more like popguns. This was only a mild annoyance, however. Everything else sounded fine. If you are considering an upgrade from DVD, it is worth it."
5,The Lakehouse for Guys,"""Frequency"" is a movie that explores the possibility of changing the past. It does this through a ham radio set and an intense Coronal Mass Ejection, which leads to intense Auroras. This phenomenon allows a police officer, portrayed by Jim Caviezel, to communicate with his deceased father, portrayed by Dennis Quaid. The Auroras allow them to reach across a 30 year span of time. With this much hindsight, the father and son work to change the past and create a much better future for themselves."
5,A great story,"If you remember 1969 (or you were too young to remember, like me) you'll like this movie. From the atmosphere of the time, to the clothing, to the ham radio, it can be nostalgic. Watching these two men working together to change the past for the better from two eras....can it be done? Watch this movie and find out. Good story and very heartfelt. The DVD offers some great addtional features, especially the commentary by Toby & Noah Emmerich -- these guys had fun making this film."
2,not happy,"Stand should be bigger so it can balance the lamp, is alittle wobbly on carpet. The shades are really delicate, so delicate I just put mine up and they have holes in them already! Where can you get replacement shades? Who knows! 60 or even 40 watt bulbs are hard to get into the lantern. Sure, you can use smaller bulbs but whats the point since I bought this to use with the 60 watt for light."
3,Meh,"This lamp looks really nice, but when it arrived, one of the pieces that the light bulb screws into was broken, now the light bulb kind of dangles there. It is also VERY top heavy. The base it too small and light, it's fallen over several times, I'm trying to find a weight to fix to the bottom of it. I hold my breath every time someone walks by it."
5,Great work--Again,"As expected, Carter and Grammer have come up with another fine cd. Drum Hat Buddha doesn't have any songs as immediately entrancing as ""When I Go"" from their first album or ""Tanglewood Tree"" from the second, but there isn't a single miss on this album either. These are songs you end up humming all day, but they are also songs that make you think and that touch on the archetypes inhabiting the human psyche. A fanatastic work--easily worth the price several times over."
4,A collection of traditional Southern flavored home plans,"The designs of William E. Poole is a compilation of Mr. Poole's designs ranging from small cottages to baronial estate homes. most include first floor master suites, gourmet kitchens and bonus rooms over the garage. Exterior detailing is exquisite and always true to the root style of the design. Interiors are designed for our modern lifestyles. If you are looking for traditional designs, particularly in a larger home; this collection is a must."
2,Very Academic,"While I have yet to finish this book, I was somewhat disappointed as the book is extremely academic and somewhat dryly written. This is an interesting topic, but it is approached in a somewhat sterile way."
5,Awesome record,"This new 45RPM 200G vinyl pressing is perfect. It is a must buy, add it to your reference recording list. Its that good."
3,"not the classic, great songs and arrangements but missing the soul","I have listened to this record off and on for years. I am a pretty big Dusty fan, and at her best, she can interpret a song and get to its essence on a deeper level as well as any singer I can think of. This record, however, seems more on the surface. The arrangements are well thought out and Dusty sings them all in a very professional manner. But she doesn't interpret as much as skim the surface emotionally of these songs. In other words, as well done as this record is, something is missing. To me, Dusty is not essentially a soul singer, but she is extremely soulful. But with the exception of ""Son of a Preacher Man"" and ""I Can't Make it Alone,"" I hear more of a light jazz singer than a soulful one. Although this record has seemed to take on legendary status over the years, to me it is well executed record that ultimately falls flat."
2,Very Overrated,"This is one of the most overrated albums of all time. I like Dusty and recommend ""The Very Best of..."" or one of the other better compilations that show both the pop and soul sides of Dusty. This album has only a few songs that are very memorable and most of those have been done better by other people. Generally, it a real bore - slow and wordy. The sound quality is good and the band is good. Also, Dusty does sing with soul, but she tries too hard too often to sing as the downtrodden 1960's rural black - and a rich English girl just can't pull it off. If she had stayed with the quality soul songs like ""So Much Love"" (track 2) this would have been the classic that some people claim it is. I've listened to this about 20 times and it still just doesn't click with me, and I like soul music and Dusty. Maybe someday it will hit me."
2,Don't be fooled...,"The revisionist history being espoused by rock critics embraces this one as a long lost gem. Actually it is a sickly sweet sounding bit of pop poop with maybe two good songs on it. When the strings aren't sending you into a diabetic coma you might catch a whiff of a couple of excellent songs like ""Preacher Man"". Basically these are interpretations of other people's songs & I can't for the life of me understand why this soul-less wonder is being lauded as a classic. There is plenty of great soul out there, but this ain't it folks..."
5,"beautifl voice, soulful delivery",dusty delivers the goods in this american list of soul hits. this album has stood the test of time. it ca go up againt any r & b recording today. in my opinion.
4,Great CD - a classic,This CD is timeless and Dusty Springfield had a wonderful voice. I've enjoyed this disc immensly. And would highly recommend it to anyone who likes that downhome sound with class.
5,What a voice! What a classic!,"The selection of songs is strongly R&B.; Aretha Franklin's producers produced the original record. The Memphis Cats provide backup vocals. A couple of the songs didn't ring true for me, but the majority of the music was divine.In the liner notes, it says that Carole King considered Dusty to be the premier singer of her songs. And wonderfully enough, this CD has Dusty singing ""You Have a Friend,"" previously unreleased. This song was recorded before James Taylor made it a hit. Having this recording on the CD makes up for not having ""You Don't Have to Say You Love Me."""
5,Simply one of the finest albums of the 60s,"Rated by everyone and his dog as among the finest albums of the whole of the 1960s, this CD set is quite magical in that it all adds up to much more than the sum of its parts. Take the Sweet Inspirations, add the Memphis Cats, sprinkle with a liberal dash of Gerry Wexler, Thom Dowd and Arif Mardin, then add the magic ingredient that is Dusty Springfield and you've got yourself a little piece of musical heaven."
5,Simply Works,"It was a little tweaky getting my Mac to use the server. I had to install the printer driver before running the Keyspan client. Which was hard since my Mac was not connected to the printer. But this is a Mac issue not a Keyspan issue so I gave it 5 stars.Once installed, it is completely transparent and all 3 of my computers can print and scan."
4,"Still messing with it, but basically works...","Like many here, I bought this Server so that I can share my all-in-one scanner/printer/fax without having to have it tied to a computer, and it left on.The unit came up quickly, was easy to configure, and allowed us to quickly share the printer functions. The SW that comes with it and installs on each PC seems smart enough to automatically reserve the printer, do the print, and then release the printer. So as a printer, it works fine.Still having issues with using the printer as a scanner, and getting multiple pages scanned (one works fine). Something is just not configured properly.But I do think I will get it soon, and do recommend the Keysapn Server."
1,No Windows 7 Support,"Keyspan (now Trip-lite) does not provide Windows 7 support. If they haven't got software out by now it seems they do not intend to continue support for the product. If you're migrating to Windows 7 ever I wouldn't buy this. That said, I've owned one for over 2 years and loved it, despite it being a little tricky to network under XP SP3. I am very disappointed Trip-Lite has chosen to abandoned the product. There really isn't anything I can find that is similar. I've tried the old software in Win 7 and it will not work."
2,Incompatibility,"It will not operate in Vista without crashing (my laptop crashes to the BSOD EVERY time I connect to the device). It conflicts with Logitechs Quickcam software (or Logitech conflicts with it...neither company will take responsibility or assist in the matter). It constantly loses its server settings, forcing me to reset the unit by unplugging it or my pc's wont recognise it. Being that it wont operate in Vista, I see little hope it will work under Windows 7. All I have is a single USB multifunction printer attatched to it and it wont even run that correctly without assistance."
3,Not worth purchasing,The Keyspan US-4A does not work at all with Vista. It does not work well with external hard drives. It is very slow when using with other periphals. The support is terrible. I would not recommend purchasing this unit.
2,Might be good?,"This product may be good, but it was not compatible with our large format scanner (Colortrac SmartLF Cx40), so I can't accurately review the product itself. I can review the setup issues and customer service - I have a pretty fair knowledge of computers (thought I'm not a trained IT person). It took me a little too long to set it up, the manual should tell you to first make sure ALL of your firewalls are down. This means your Windows firewall, server firewall and disable any antivirus software while installing. I use ESET Smart Security for protection, and the firewall needs to be disabled every time you want to use the product. At any rate, Keyspan was recently bought by Tripp Lite, so to make things more confusing, the customer service reps are still learning how to troubleshoot the product. 2 out of 3 reps I spoke with were quite helpful though. I think if you have a popular printer or server, you'll have better luck with this product than I did."
4,Keyspan US-4A USB Server,"Keyspan US-4A 4-Port USB Server (12 Mbps)Since new software/firmware update, this product works almost flawlessly. When it doesn't, unplug it for a few seconds, plug it in again and it's good for another few months.Bi-directional - works for scanners as well as printers"
2,doesn' work with al products,"This product didn't work with my wireless mouse, scanner, and it would mess up my print que and I would have to restart the Keyspan software to get it working again.I returned it."
3,Don't need this if running MAc OSX 10.39 or higher,"if you're on a Macintosh running OX 10.39 or higher you don't need this product for sharing with other machines on your network , The Mac OS shares USB printers and peripherals thru BonJour A piece of cake."
4,Great for the beginner!,"I've been training dogs for 10 years, and I have recommended this book to all of my puppy owners! It's a great way to get through the first year of puppyhood, and have a dog you'll be proud to call yours. All of my students have found the information easy to understand, the methods easy to use, and the results are wonderful!"
3,The Honeys shoot the curl!,"Not exactly everything recorded by Brian Wilson's pet project (some B-sides are missing), but this femme-version of The Beach Boys is modest, upbeat, and enjoyable. Since buying The Honeys on vinyl has become nearly impossible for anyone living on a budget, this CD really is a surfer-lover's godsend. All their important singles and major back-up work is included, and the surprises are a-plenty: a match-up with Glen Campbell on ""Guess I'm Dumb"" is fabulous, Gary Usher's ""Sacramento"" is delicious, and (recording as Ginger and the Snaps!) the girls come up with a near-classic on ""Seven Days in September"". Other great songs: ""Raindrops"" (hard to get that one outta your head!) and ""Oly Oxen Free Free Free"". Scrappy perhaps, and unpolished, but spirited and infectious. Surf's up!!"
3,Honeys,"This CD sounds really 60's, which is great. I didn't really like the other singers in the compilation, but that's what the skip button is for. I will also recommened the Japanese release ""Brian Wilson productions"" over this one because it has a couple ""Honeys"" songs that are not in here, both essentials."
2,"good music, but way to skimpy!","Rhino record's The Best of Foghat is full of eight excellent tunes,but of course eight songs is an extremely skimpy cd. Of course the eight songs chose for this complation are good,but who the heak puts out a cd with only eight tracks on it? Heak in the 70's most best ofs and greatest hits had at least ten songs on them. Another complaint about this cd is that ""Slow Ride"" is the single version, not the full length album version. Buy ""Fool for the City"" to get the full length version of Slow Ride."
3,Only 8 tunes - Here's the list,"The Billboard 100 singles ratings are shown in parenthesis: (chart peak/year)1. I Just Want to Make Love to You (83/1972) (live version = 33/1977)2. Slow Ride (20/1973)3. What a Shame (83/1973)4. Drivin' Wheel (34/1976)5. Fool for the City (45/1976)6. I'll Be Standing By (67/1977)7. Stone Blue (36/1978)8. Third Time Lucky (23/1979)This gets all their Billboard 100 charted hits except ""Stranger in My Home Town"" (81/1980)."
4,Too Fat Polka .. Just Right for Me!,"I bought this CD just for the song ""Too Fat Polka"", and I have to tell you, the version is the best I have ever listened to. It keeps a great polka beat and is just hilariously done. And to be truthful, I listened to the rest of the CD and found it to be very entertaining. Great stuff. Arthur Godfrey was a little before my time and I will leave the history or reviewing to those that actually listened to and/or watched him. But I tell you this, I was happy that I bought this CD and added it to my collection. One gets a little history lesson and great musical entertainment at the same time. If anything, you can't go wrong with Arthur Godfrey's ""Too Fat Polka"". This CD was just right for me!"
5,Beautifully done,"Boyz II Men's new song is quite possibly the most beautiful of their works...The first time I heard it I was in the car and had to pull off the road I was crying so hard! Boyz II Men has the extraordinary ability to read people's emotions and put them into moving lyrics with equally moving music. This is, without a doubt, one of the best songs I've heard in a long time."
4,a cd very pleasant!,A cd where celtic and mystical atmospheres are melted in a perfect space.It is ascoltabile also in the meditation moments!A listen to low volume in the silence is the better way to appreciate this beautifulst cd!Only defect is that the songs are a lot of identical!However I advise the purchase!
2,Pearls of the Pacific,"The material is there for an excellent book,however, this is really a poorly written book.It is very difficult to follow, as it jumps from subject to subject and never completes any of them.As a career USN sailor,many of the ships I served in often visited Subic Bay in the mid 1950's, and my family and I lived there from 1975through 1978. We lived on the base, but often visited Olongopo and saw the things the writter tries to describe.This is just a very poor attempt to describe some of the events that occured in SubicBay."
1,"Probably the worst direct-to-DVD sequel you'll see this year, which is saying a lot","The original Boogeyman was, well, it was bad. Boogeyman 2 though makes the first film look close to Shakespeare though, completely disregarding any kind of supernatural thrills for a tried and true, formulaic, slasher flick that isn't only predictable, it's downright boring. What is good to note about Boogeyman 2 is that the film doesn't pull any punches with blood and gore, but the film as a whole is so atrociously bad that you'll wonder why you even bothered with it in the first place. The direction is tired and trite, the acting is godawful (genre stalwart Tobin ""Jigsaw"" Bell and Xena: Warrior Princess veteran Renee O'Connor have done much, much better than this), and the effects are almost laughable. In an era of direct-to-DVD horror sequels that have been flooding the marketplace lately, Boogeyman 2 just may be the worst of the bunch, which in itself is saying quite a lot. Avoid."
3,again?,"ok the first one sucked and this one dident do much better, but it did. tobin bell playes a great character but the film lacks in story and action making it a perfect sequal to the first disasterous film."
2,Blah Blah,"Boring, and not even a compelling rental. The gory parts were a bit too gratuitous w/o adding value to the story. Average acting. Overall, average story without any real visual engagement."
1,Not what I expected,"First off, it is best to note that this movie is not a continuation of the original Boogeyman. In fact, the only thing the two movies share in common is the title.The best way to describe the film is: dress a man up in a boogeyman costume, mix it with any of the Saw films, and viola, Boogeyman 2.Hope this helps in your decision."
4,Pretty good flick!........,I really liked this movie even more than the original. Kept me entertained without dragging on or being too corny (which is the problem with a lot of horror movies nowadays). The acting was pretty decent; for once there weren't any annoying corny side characters that have no real purpose other than adding to the body count. The plot was interesting and unique I think-- centered on a group of kids in a psychiatry clinic whose fears ultimately lead them to their demise. The ending wasn't a complete shocker but I wouldn't call it predictable necessarily... Guess it depends on the person.... Overall I say it's definitely a good DVD to pick up and enjoy on a quiet weekend in with the lights off. Enjoy!
2,Boogeyman 2,"I must be in a time warp. The Boogeyman 2 I just received stars John Carradine and is directed by Bruce Starr & Ulli Lommel. It is nothing like the movie description reviewed by the others. Where did this one come from? It looks like a low budget movie from the 1970's. (Is it??) I just finished watching Boogeyman (which I liked), and popped Boogeyman 2 in the machine to continue what I thought would be a similar story. The version I have is horrible. I actually wish the Boogeyman would come out of the closet and take this DVD with him."
5,this is just a comment=),"Boogeyman 2 (2008)ok, i haven't seen the movie yet but if it involves producers sam raimi, rob tapert, and divine actress renee o'connor than it's going to entertain us no matter what. they worked very hard on this film for it to only be released on dvd so as a fan i'm adding my support to show them the appreciation they deserve. these guys love what they do and who couldn't love them for that?! i hope everyone gets something out of this movie whether they purchase or rent it. cheers!"
3,This Boogeyman Wasn't Bad At All,"I was actually surprised at how much fun I had watching this flick. Some of these direct to dvd time killers are better than what's being thrown at us in the theaters. I'm still struggling with trying to watch the first bore-fest but this little gem got me hooked right away. This is a straight up slasher with some supernatural flavor used more as a decoy than for major thrills. If you like these films then get yourself a copy and you will definitely enjoy yourself. They spent less money this time but the addition of Tobin Bell (Today's Vincent Price) is perfect. I recommend this one for fans of the slasher genre, Mr. Bell, and cheesy little dvds. Check Tobin out in Buried Alive also."
3,Better then the first movie,"This is another movie i bought with caution seeing as how i thought the first boogyman wasnt that good.but when i watched it i was quickly shown this would be alot different.first off its NOT rated PG-13 which is a BIG plus as i hate PG-13 horror movies.this one had blood,gore and creative kills.the story was better then the last movie and it dosent really connect the first two films except to talk about the main character from the first one and show his picture.this story also made slightly more sense then the frist and the setting(basically an insane asylum)is also better.if you find it $10 or less or come acroos it on cable(without commercials)then watch it and its not a bad way to pass the time."
5,"a ""lyrical detective novel...""","""Set in the aftermath of the Second World War, Americans and Germans alike become entangled in the hunt for Hitler's chief scientist, Klingsor. This lyrical detective novel encompasses nuclear physics, a love affair and the Nuremberg trials in a gripping introduction to the work of Mexico's Crack generation."" This is as reviewed in ""The New Essential Guide to Spanish Reading"" which is published by America Reads Spanish: a campaign aimed to increase the use and reading of the Spanish language through the thousands of libraries, schools and book stores in the US."
4,Traición,"Esta novela, premiada con el Premio Biblioteca Breve 1999, nos sitúa en los años posteriores al fin de la Segunda Guerra Mundial. El protagonista, Francis P. Bacon, es un teniente norteamericano encargado de investigar aspectos de los programas nazis de desarrollo atómico. Con este panorama, numerosas reseñas literarias han destacado la presencia del dilema faustiano o de la fusión de ciencia, historia y literatura. Ciertamente es así, pero no encontramos sólo eso en esta magnífica novela. La lectura que he realizado de esta novela me ha concedido, por encima de cualquier otra consideración, la contemplación de una historia personal excelentemente trazada, plagada de vivencias psicológicas de gran valor. En suma, una historia de las debilidades del alma humana y una historia de traición. Recomiendo esta obra a todos los lectores inquietos que disfrutan abriendo su mente a nuevos conocimientos y que contemplan sin prejuicios el comportamiento humano."
3,Good Vs Evil Vs Yourself,"The angel in you Vs. the Devil in you... You watch both play their game, be it to deceive one another or to win the life long battle... The battle within yourselfI must admit, I couldn't keep the book down when I started reading it...but,I was stuck in an airplane for 9 hours with nothing to do.. When I finished it all I thought was this.. As in the case of his other book ""The Alchemist"" Paulo tends to keep his fictional characters and storyline extremely simple... He only targets to throw out thoughts along the pages, in this case, about the fight of good and evil, angels and devils, and the introduction of fear and its effects on people...It's as if there are certain statements that Paulo first types to keep in the book and then he builds the characters and storyline to fit the statements in.This style is getting repetitive."
3,"Choosing good or evil, is it a good question?","Even if it is not the best book I've read from Paulo Coelho, it is still interesting for one reason on my point of view. It is a kind of introspection on human motivations when he has to choose between good or evil. We see that human nature is not good or evil, but man (woman) has ability to choose. It also goes a step further because this story shows that when we make a choice for good instead of evil, it is not always because we have listened to our heart, but because of the threat coming from our fear!"
4,Fears...,"A challenge in order to figure out if human nature is good or evil...another great book by CoelhoThe Stranger meets Chantel in the town of Viscos. The stranger is supposed to be the devil as described by the people, and Chantel is his tool to bring a tragedy to the town that is famous for its peace, serenity and trouble free days.The book talks about the fears of people when they are faced with a change in their everyday life, how people try to find every possible way to escape confrontation.Chantel makes the so called ""Devil"" re-consider his plan, and what he wants to get out of it...She opens up the eyes of the town and how they have been deceiving themselves...Get another opinion of whether human nature is good or evil..."
3,For [PRICE] the book should have been edited better.,"This book has some good information, but it is very hard to get through, references to diagrams are in the text with out any clue as to where the diagrams are, and enough already with all the words of wisdom, and biblical references.There are paragrahs, but it is like reading one big run on sentence. For [PRICE] we should be getting a more polished easier to read copy. I am not convinced it was a wise purchase."
3,Read OVER and OVER,"This book contains a tremendous amount of good information, all of which cannot be retained in one reading. I have highlighted it as I would a textbook for later review. That's the good news.The bad news is, without highlighting, the book is hard to deal with due to platitudes and cliches scattered throughout. His valuable advice could be conveyed in half the space and he sorely needs an editor.On balance, I'm glad I bought the book and intend to get his other one (Precision Shooting)"
2,Review of Trapshooting Secrets - WS-South Africa,"The author definately has a lot of tips, but the general layout of the book is poor. There is a lot of repetition, so both the content and price could be cut by half. It would have been better to see the Illustrations in their relevant chapters.There are also places where the author contradict previous statements in his book. I think it is after all this still worth the time reading the book, try out suggestions, and you will surely still learn something you did not know."
5,Solving Your Trap Shooting Problems Step by Step,This book is packed with detailed information on Trap Shooting. It doesn't have a constant flow as it jumps around and is repetitious in areas but that somewhat helps in the learning process. This book could use some editing and I would like see the diagrams close to the referenced text instead of in the back of the book. File it in your library as you will read it over and over. With each read you will discover and understand your strengths and weaknesses in more depth. Buy it and improve your scores whether you're a beginner or think you are a pro. I wish this book was smaller in size so it would fit better in my range bag for reference before and during tournaments.
1,Do not buy this book,I am relatively new to trap shooting. This book was just a compendium of useless ideas that clutter the brain and degrade shooting. It astounded me that a subject as inherently simple as trap shooting could be so massively over-complicated in such a fashion.Do not buy the book. It is a waste of money and time.
2,Is there good information past chatper one?,"I'm a new shooter but an avid reader. This book is so poorly written I could not, after several attempts, get past the first few pages. It repeats itself so often it is very, very difficult to read. If you're a new shooter, look elswhere."
4,"Excellent content, poor spelling and grammar.","This book is aimed at the sort of person who likes great depth of subject matter. Everything is covered in great detail, and this excellent book is only marred by poor layout, spelling, and grammar. In all anyone reading this book should be able to glean fresh insight into the game."
2,Disappointed,The book is poorly laid out. The content is significantly redundant. All the illustrations that are referred to in the text are located at the rear of the book resulting in having to flip back and forth in order to grasp the material. The material is too scientific and reads like an engineering manual. It does not provide much value to the novice shooter trying to improve his or her scores. I actually found more benefit from a skeet shooting book but I had purchased at the same time as this one. the material in this book is very basic and and does not provide much value. Trap shooters Bible is a little bit better but it still is overly technical and is difficult to absorb. There are better resources on learning trap than this book. I suggest saving your money.
2,Disappointing . . .,"This was my first Binchy book. Only due to the advise of 'fans', I will read another. But not because of the quality of this one! While there were a few short stories in this collection that really caught my attention, most left me asking ""what was the point of that""? As another reviewer mentioned, there was not much depth here with only minor exception. I'm a slow reader & this was a fast read! Not much to savor or keep from these stories."
2,Not the book I was hoping for...,"After reading all of Maeve Binchy's books, this is the first and only one to disappoint me. I think the reader has to be a fan of short stories, I found out that I am not. I wanted more...every story felt like the beginning of a great book and then...nothing. What a let down."
4,Entertaining collection of short stories,"Maeve Binchy has an uncanny ability to create believable characters and sketch out a plot in 10-15 pages. These stories each contain an interesting twist or unexpected ending which keep up the interest for the reader. They each have a bit of universal and recognizable truth to them. Binchy shines her brightest in her full-length novels, but her short stories are also well worth reading."
3,"Formulaic, But An Escape Read","Give Binchy credit, she knows what the public wants, and apparently, it is a lucrative business. But after reading three of her books, the rest become fairly predictable. This collection of shorts is very much thus."
4,Review,"I liked these short stories very much, the only reason I did not give them 5 stars is, that I like novels more than short stories."
5,"A Great Read, a Terrific Listen","I have to admit that I don't read Binchy's novels because I prefer to listen to them on audio book. Her books translate SO marvelously to tape! This unabridged tape set is wonderfully read and the short story is a perfect format for listening. Each story could be turned into a novel. I was instantly involved with the characters and the situations. Even if you don't usually read short stories, if you like Binchy don't miss this collection."
3,Not one of Binchy's best,Suprisingly this book seems to come up short. It is not one of Binchy's better books. If you're looking for a light read in a doctor's office this may be your book but if you're looking for a substantive read pick another one of Binchy's books like Tara Road or Echoes.
2,Her short stories are too flat and underdeveloped.,"The best part of Maeve Binchy's books is the way she slowly unrolls her characters and her stories. With her short story compilations, she doesn't get to do either so it ends up being lifeless and leaves me unhappy! Maeve needs something between her very long novels and her short stories."
5,Great book,"This is a great book of short stories from the grand dame of Irish fiction! This book hasz wonderful varied short stories, perfect for dipping in and out. Read it and pass it on!"
1,Per circuit breakers to small.,Unit fine except the per circuit rating of 15 amps was insufficient. Had to change some of the push button breakers to 20 amp. Would have been nice to know ahead of time.
2,DESCRIPTION NOT ACCURATE,STATED 40 AMP BUT WAS TWO 20 AMPS WHICH I GUESS THEY THINK MAKES 40 AMP. WAS STILL ONLY 20 AMP. WILL ONLY BUY FROM KNOWN SOURCES IN THE FUTURE.
1,"$10.95 delivers only the front page abstract, not the full article!","This article may be excellent, but what comes through after purchase is only a single front page containing its abstract."
3,One out of six,"I bought this album because I heard Boyer's ""Three Olympians"" on Sirius radio one day and, as it turns out, this is the only work on the album with any musical value in my opinion. ""Three Olympians"" is a work for string orchestra and is a wonderful addition to the repetoire. The rest of the album is bad John Williams and doesn't come up to the quality of the string orchestra work. Knowing this now, I'm not sure I would recommend or buy this album again."
4,Insightful!,"Ronni Eisenberg’s book demonstrates how your work habits can be your best friends or your worst enemies when it comes to organizing your office productively. The book is a mixture of common-sense suggestions and useful organizational tips. She includes helpful hints for home-office workers and organizational tips for those who use personal digital devices. At times, it’s a little too intricate (you may feel you are getting detailed instructions on how to tie your shoes), however, it also offers organizational gems...."
1,"I didn't like this, nothing new.","I am very organized and always looking for new ways to improve efficiency, organization and cleanliness. I have a home office so I need to keep it neat, and I apply organization and cleanliness to my entire household. This book offered me nothing new. Maybe I've already heard all the tips from Franklin Covey and Julie Morgenstern. If you haven't heard of either of those, the book may help you, but if you're already pretty organized, it's repeat."
2,Somewhat outdated and only ideal for total beginners...,"Most books on writing should be ""evergreen"" and able to last throughout the ages. Well, unfortunately Jenna Glatzer's ""Make A Real Living as a Freelance Writer"" is not one of them. Here's my main peeves with this book, which promised a whole lot from previous reviews but just did not deliver much to me:1) A number of the links are outdated, especially regarding writing classes.2) A lot of what she says anyone who has ever owned a copy of the ""Writer's Market"" or read even one issue of a magazine such as ""Writer's Digest"" should already know.This book may work for total beginners, but for anyone who has freelance experience, this book is a really serious disappointment. I wish I had not purchased this book, and I rarely say that about any work - let alone a writing book."
5,We have a winner!,"Listen up all you hopeful magazine writers: YOU MUST BUY THIS BOOK!And NO, borrowing it from the library is not going to cut it. Why? Because you'll get frustrated that you won't be able to dog-ear and mark up the pages that are loaded with insider tips. I have been a freelance writer for four years. I know that if you'll follow Jenna's advice, particularly her guidance on query letters, you will soon have the confidence to bang on the doors of your dream markets -- and start getting assignments. Unfortunately, there's no magic wand, as editors frequently nix ideas they simply doesn't like -- but the rejections won't be because your queries lack focus or interest. As well, your income will quickly grow if you complete Jenna's worksheets, and crystalize your short and long term goals. Perhaps the best thing about Jenna's book is its contagious enthusiasm.

5,"Sharp, practical advice from an insider who knows","Want to be a freelance writer? Jenna Glatzer tells you the truth about the business in a conversational, factual, no-nonsense style sprinkled with her warm personality and humor. She lays out the writer's path and bids you to take the first steps.After reading so many books on writing that don't deliver on the promises they make, Jenna's book is refreshingly honest and practical. If I were teaching a course on writing, I'd make sure every student had her book.Make a Real Living as a Freelance Writer is great for novices and veterans. She surprises you with solid tips on researching and using the internet to full advantage. Her book takes the fear out of an often imposing business and reminds one that writing is compelling fun.Rebecca Jacoby, copywriterwww.afewchosenwords.comwww.beckyjacoby.com"
2,Disappointing,"As I was reading this, I kept shaking my head. This book didn't really give me a lot of help. There really isn't much in here that I couldn't find in a lot of other, much better, books. I found the advice to be plain wrong in some cases, ill-advised in others. And the author's attitude bothered me. It was off-putting.It wasn't a really horrible book, which is why it got two stars, but I've read books that gave me a lot more help. If you're insistent on buying this book, though, my copy will be up for sale. :)"
3,You get what you pay for!,"The product was shipped and delivered very quickly.The suction cup didn't stick to my windshield at all and the string/rod only lasted like two weeks.The flag itself is nice and all strings are in tact.I used an old necklace to hang it around my mirror.As my title states, you get what you pay for.The flag was cheap and you get your money's worth"
1,ARRRRRRRRRRRRGH!!!,"I read parts of this aloud as examples of bad writing. This is HORRIBLE! The story is muddled. Cliches abound. The characters are poorly depicted. Where is the inner turmoil the vampire showed in the movie ""Dracula's Daughter""? Why did he so strangely change the werewolf's shapeshifting nature to a method unrelated to that of the movies? Since when do Dracula and his daughter invoke Satan? If you're not going to stick to what has been established in the movies, then just write an original novel with your own material and characters. Bad, bad, bad, bad, BAD!!!"
1,"Oh, the horror -- Oh, the pain!","This was the worse book I have ever read! I cannot understand what prompted Universal to publish this? They can't be that hard up for stories, or could they? Why didn't Universal have Christopher Schildt, who wrote NIGHT OF DRACULA and FRANKENSTEIN THE LEGACY write their next books. Schildt is fantastic!"
1,just as bad as his last attempt,"this book is another awful attempt to keep the universal monsters' legacy alive. the publishers should either go back to jeff rovin, who wrote ""return of the wolfman"" or find a new author to continue the series."
4,"brilliant, almost","For many years, this has been my go-to translation When listening to the Ring. It is very well done stylistically, and makes good reading on its own, which is high praise for any opera libretto translation. This translation preserves the syllables and rhythms of the original German, so it is singable (well, anyway that is what my musically trained friends tell me). It seems to be an excellent translation, but my German is kinda weak, so I have no way to judge the accuracy.One big problem: it has only the English translation. It does NOT have the German text. However, I have found that if you follow the syllables and who is singing, with a little practice, I can follow along with the Ring just by reading this book, even w/o the German text side-by-side."
5,Wonferdul translation,"This is a great volume for any Ring lover. The translations are solid and easy to use with the German original since the phonetic cadences match. Even when listening to the Goodall Ring (which uses the Porter translation) this book keeps me up to speed in situations where the English is difficult to follow.I also like the typeface and translation of stage directions and settings, as well."
2,Bad Translation,"Stay away from this translation - it's the pits! The vocabulary is very contemporary and there is no lyricism. The more poetic passages come off as...florid, overheated. There has to be a better translation!"
5,Great Film,"This is a great film from a cinematographic view point. It is very well filmed, the script is well-done, director does an awesome job to relate the attitude of service in hot countries. The background scenery is very well picked. Nothing is done in an excessive way in this film !!! It's definitely worth owning!!!"
3,"'Beau Travail"" - pourquoi?","Although this is a stunning piece of cinematography it is a mediocre film. There were moments that you found yourself asking, ""what is this film about?"".The gist appears to be that of the life of a chap in the French Foreign Legion who has a spot of jealousy regarding one of the new recruits. This is not really explained and I don't think a plot was on the mind of the production team when this film was made.Watch it out of curiosity but don't buy it. Get a book about African landscapes instead!!"
1,"A few beautiful sequences, but not worth the trouble","This movie promises more than it delivers. There some wonderful shots of scenery from the desert in North Africa. There are plenty of very beautiful half naked men running around the desert, but the pace of the story is painfully slow. You know something happens in the movie so you wait and wait to see what it is. And in the end it's not worth the wait."
2,Beau Travail is bogus,"French movie directors never feel compelled to follow a narrative arc. In this movie, there's no coherent narrative at all. We have endless flash-forwards (or are they flash backs?) and when the final credits come up you are left wondering whether they didn't leave one reel in the can when they transferred this to DVD. The dialog amounts to a few incohate phrases and little human interaction. The scenery of Djibouti is breathtaking, but ""Sheltering Sky"" is much better. The rigor of French Foreign Legion training (and the consequent impoverishment of the Legionaires intellectual and spiritual lives) is interesting to observe, but this move can't be recommended."
2,"AH, SWEAT MYSTERY OF LIFE....... [!]","and oodles simply oodles of body-odor!TWO STARS and that only for the pounding disco [?] sequences.Now really THIS is the French version of ""Taboo"" and sightly better than that waste of film. The 'bad, bad sargeant' - resembling Kermit the Frog - obsesses about this Young recruit and then sum .....nothing really happens except for quite a few close-ups of buns and pouts .... more buns and pouts and still more buns and pouts ... {yeech!} it's all very GQ alal Morocco [possibly a remake of that Dietrich/Cooper opus? Nah - are u kiddin???]. Melville was never quite like this .... perhaps Conrad[ish?]FOR real depth see Dirk Bogard in ""Death In Venice"" or Rod Steiger and John Philip Law in the daring ""Sargeant"" or the sometimes obtainable ""Bofors Gun"" - now there's something with David Warner.BUT this one .... get the deodorant!"
1,"NICE BODYS,BUT NOT A GREAT PLOT","This movie is quite slow, for those who are expecting a gay film, this is not, it may under certain circunstances, but is more about tehe foreign legion in Africa. I saw it once, that was enough, I wouldn not recomended it"
3,Excellent Movie -- Terrible DVD,"I saw *Beau Travail* at the theatres and thought it was excellent. And purchasing the DVD, I still think it's an incredibly good film. However, I'm VERY disappointed in the DVD transfer quality from New Yorker Films.It seems that they transferred a VHS copy to DVD, so the image has lots of visual noise, irritating scan lines, and general poor quality video. The picture tears apart in the action scenes.This film deserves a much better DVD."
1,What the?,"Do you ever catch yourself watching a movie that hasn't been worth your time, but stick to it through the end 'just in case' and thinking to yourself.... ""If this is the end, I'm gonna be mad...""?This is that movie, intensified 100 times.Then again, after an hour you're ready for it to be over so you don't really get mad. I whole-heartedly recommend that you save your time and energy and watch/buy something else. I really wouldn't even recommend renting this one. As others have said, the actual cinematography is nothing to be ashamed of, but its almost like recording the lineolium peel and releasing it on DVD with a half naked guy on the cover. No matter how sharp the image is, there's just no story in front of the camera."
5,Excellent book.,"This is a great book, especially for teaching theatre to middle school students. It was in pristeen condition, for a great price, and I'll use it a lot in my classes."
5,Unfairly overlooked classic,"A lot of people might dismiss Terrorvision as simply being a bad movie or a stupid movie without realizing that it's very tongue-in-cheek. Gerrit Graham is terrific and his over-the-top, cartoonish performance really adds to this movie. The TV monster is one of my favorite monsters ever. It would be great to see this on dvd.""Oh man that bikini is DY-NAMITE!"""
4,Plimsoul Bliss,I just love popping in my Plimsoul CD on the long drive out to San Diego from Phoenix and rock'in my way home. They are one of my fovorite bands from the 80's.
5,There's More Than the Polovetsian Dances,"If you've always strongly suspected that there must be more good music in Borodin's unfinished opera Prince Igor than just the Polovetsian Dances, you're right. This excellent performance, brillantly recorded in St. Petersburg's famous Mariinsky Theater, home of the Kirov State Opera, conducted by Valery Gergiev, proves this resoundingly. Dramatically, this opera (the libretto, that is) is a mess. It was left unfinished by Borodin, whose career in chemistry kept him too busy.But musically, it's full of magnificient stuff which should be heard much more often!"
5,review of Prince Igor,"Prince Igor is an opera that is not only considered to be the greatest work of its composer, Borodin, but is also considered the greatest Russian opera. The conductor, Alexander Gergiev, is a very famous Russian also, and if you buy this disk you will see why. Great disk."
2,Dont waste your money,"We bought this TV for 4.000.00 and had to have the bulb changed after 2 years and now after just 4 years it has a recall on it. It has blue shadowing and Sony offered us the ability to purchase another Sony LCD and pay 843.00 for a 2,000 TV. What a great deal right. I told them that I had already spent 4 grand and wanted this one repaired, so I am waiting."
5,A Visual Buffet!,"This book takes everyday objects (and some historical objects as well), and makes them tremendously exciting by truly demonstrating how form follows function. The graphics are outstanding, and the attention to detail is unsurpassed by any text of its type of which I am familiar. The Ultimate Visual Dictionary 2000 is outstanding as a reference text for educators and students alike: I wish I had access to such a book when I was in school!"
2,Definitely Not for English Language Learners,"I need a visual dictionary that contains names of common objects, items, and parts. I am not interested in, at least for now, uncommon words, words that even native English speakers are unfamiliar with. I very much want to know the practical, useful, common words: French doors, lazy Susan, dormer, marmalade, tarmac, hamstring, cul-de-sac, colonial house, mud room, kitchen island, high chair, and so on. To my disappointment, this dictionary has none of those words. Instead, it is full of technical words. All I care to know about Venus is the name Venus. Why would I need to know the names of fossils? Temple of Amon-Re? Thyreophorans? Viking ships? House of the future? No, I need to know the house of the present!To me, this dictionary is more like a visual encyclopedia for those who are working on school projects or crosswords, definitely not for somebody like me, who is learning English."
5,A Moving Speech Remembered By All,"This is another wonderful book from Thurston Clarke, who is well known for his meticulous research, rich detail, funny anecdotes, powerful writing. Once again we, the reader, are pulled into a vivid story about which we already have strong memories and impressions. ASK NOT illuminates and refreshes and untangles our memories of Kennedy's inspiring and challenging words. We are reminded of how uplifted we felt on first hearing his inaugural address 45 years ago. Clarke's complete picture of the preparation for the speech and the inaugural celebrations bring alive a wonderful chapter in our history."
1,Insufficient Research,"Clarke's glaring research error: Author of The Prophet, Kahlil Gibran (1883-1931), in an article titled ""The New Frontier"" wrote ""Are you a politician asking what your country can do for you or a zealous one asking what can you do for your country?"". Clarke sure missed this one, as have so many before him. Did Kennedy just paraphrase, or did he plagarize? I would have liked to have seen Clarke deal with this sticky issue."
1,A Sad piece of American History hdryden911@netzero.net,"I don't understand how it could possibly have happened! JFK was given such extreme honor and notoriety for a speech which so obviously stated the EXACT OPPOSITE of what the Democrats and the Liberals believe in. It is the Republicans and the Conseratives who believe in citizens doing for themselves, and the Government NOT giving the citizens loads of free goodies, and welfare, and handouts. - Then why would Kennedy say, ""ASK NOT WHAT YOUR COUNTRY WILL DO FOR YOU, BUT SAY WHAT YOU WILL DO FOR YOUR COUNTRY!"" That statement is NOT Democratic, that is Republican! It is not Liberal,it is Conservative! It is probably the biggest JOKE ever laid on the American People!"
3,"Different, Very Different",The Miracle Whip beats and softly surreal organ grinding melts around the alternating vocals of Margaret Fiedler and David Callahan. Bitter anger mixes with gentle confusion to jarring effect. Many of these songs (and the transitions between them) would be head-scratchers if they weren't so playful. There's definitely nothing else like Moonshake.
5,"Quintessential Jack Elliot...singin', pickin' and talkin'...","If you have an interest in Ramblin' Jack when he was at the top of his game as the mentee of Woody and a mentor of Dylan, get ahold of this 1970 release, originally an LP on the Reprise label. There are Woody songs, there are rappin' segments, there are a couple of selections that made sense only to Jack, and there are about five performances here which are dynamite, including Kristofferson's ""Me and Bobby McGee."" Earlier Elliot albums are available, and so are later ones, all the way up to a couple of years ago, but this is the Ramblin' Jack of Dylan's Rolling Thunder Review, the guy who was just beginning to earn the ""elder statesman"" designation. I bought this when it was brand new, but I enjoy it more now than I did then. Jack always was unique and cantankerous and inconsistent...much like Woody himself. He doesn't appeal to everybody, but if if you do like him, this is one of his most interesting releases."
4,2nd Corinthians commentary is very good,"This book is a very good, scholarly commentary on the Second letter of Paul to the Christians at Corinth. It is a tough read, however, due to the author's style. The scholarship is excellent and follows the best main-stream Christian currents of biblical study."
4,Super Chikan,"Well, I'm a sucker for the Blues. When I found this, the artist's name and the title appealed to my wackier side. And after listening to the samples, I had to get it. Now that I have it, and have listened to it a few times, I have to say that it's fun, a bit different. I like that the artist draws from his own life experiences when writing his songs. Not always true Blues, but I'm liking it. Overall, a good addition to my music library."
4,"Good Ludlum, but not the Best!","I listened to this story on CD and it was abridged. I enjoyed the story, as the protagonist has make several appearances in stories before, and has been well developed as the series has progressed. Some of the situations the capable Jon Smith encountered did seem a little far-fetched in his ability to extricate himself. There were a lot of interesting characters, all with their own agendas, who were well described in the flow of the story. Overall the story was entertaining, but not always grounded in believable reality. I do recommend the story to Ludlum fans in particular and to adventure story readers in general. While I rate it as a 4 overall, it does have a lot of entertainment in it."
1,Read it if you really ain't nothing better to do,"Well, to put it short, this is a boaring book. Mr. Ludlum skill, knwoledge and writing style are been buried with him and what last is a naif atteimpt to imitate his ""way"".The plot is pretty like a soap (including the ""idea"" of the US President's father who live since 50 year in a light security chinese prison) and some passage (as when Jon Smith enter in the carrying company ran by the bad people, just picking the locks with medic disguised pick tools) are really light year far away from a serious confidence with the covert operations literary topics.Not to mention what happens when dealing with weapons: it seems that the gun/rifle universe of Ms. Lynds stops to ""old AK47"", Beretta and a few others.I don't think Mr.Ludlum would be happy with this book."
2,disappointing,"I LOVE Ludlum books! they are great for long plane trips (or study breaks) but this book was very disappointing. I was expecting the usual twists other Ludlum-isms but none could be found! I had been under the impression that Ludlum had written most of the book. Anyone who is familiar with Ludlum's style knows that in every book the character has rubber soled shoes when they are sneaking in to get the crucial bit of evidence. I don't think Mr. Ludlum had a whole lot to do with the writing of this book. It may have been his story line but he did NOT write any of it. The ending was telegraphed from the first chapter on. The publisher should not have made it seem like it was mostly Ludlum's work, his name is MUCH more prominent on the cover than Lynds' is (I missed her name when I bought the book in the store). While the book is not bad if you are looking for a great Ludlum try something else."
2,Medicore writing; grammar errors included,"Am an avid Ludlum fan for 20 years now. This book starts out very weak and ends weakly. Even the proofreading seems shoddy. In one section, a character names threatening countries and includes: India, Pakistan, China and .. India. IN another section, a conditional sentence says : if you don't then .. and if you don't then.... Someone mixed up the negations.Has a shallow feel all around."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"The plot in this one involves some potential chemical weapons, and China. Apparently the Chinese are holding a political prisoner and have been for many years.This man, it seems, is likely the father of the US president. So, a bit of rebel action inside China, and some other fun with nasty weapons for the Doc and his gang."
5,Shemekia Rocks!,"Shemekia is definetly a unique voice in music today. Her songs are ""The Gospel of Life,"" which is what good blues music should be. Yes her voice is a powerful gospel style instrument, but she is still able to deliver each song with the various emotions behind the lyrics (which you can actually understand), be they sadness, happiness, longing for love, etc. She is truly a unique talent and I hope we keep hearing from Shemekia with collections like this one. She has come a long way from her first album where she merely belted out the songs. I hope she continues to grow, expand and entertain us for a long, long time."
2,GOOD EFFORT BUT NARROW IN SCOPE,"AS BLUES DVD'S GO, THIS ONE IS JUST OK. SHEMEKIA'S SINGING STYLE IS SOMEWHAT LIMITED. IT SEEMS AS IF EVERY SONG SOUNDS THE SAME.AFTER AWHILE I JUST BECAME BORED WITH THE SHOW AND STARTED LOOKING IN MY COLLECTION FOR MY ETTA JAMES DVD. SORRY SHEMEKIA BUT YOU HAVN'T RISEN ABOVE OPENING ACT SHOW.EVERY SONG DOSEN'T NEED TO BE A GOSPEL STYLE PRESENTATION..."
2,Incomplete,"Tsol was a great band however this compilation fails for two reasons. Number one and most important is lack of any songs from the ""Beneath the Shadows"" Lp which is perhaps their most cohesive and intelligent record. Secondly I fail to see the importance of including the Tender Fury material as Tender Fury was just a sign of the impending TSOL meltdown. Best to seek out ""Beneath The Shadows"" lp or ""Dance With Me"" for a better representation of TSOL."
3,Not quite the Cavern -- or Paul's best effort,"Being a huge Beatle (and McCartney) fan, I usually buy everything pertaining to them (or him) that I can find. This would be the one item that might cause me to think twice about spending my hard-earned money. The concert lacks a certain energy and Paul sings a little below pitch throughout. He was either tired, suffering with throat problems or the monitor system in the new Cavern was poor. It is so bad that I can hardly get through a single number without cringing! Also, the accompanying musicians seem to lack assurance and just ""good old Rock and Roll spirit"". Paul is usually much more inspired than this. The promotional materials that accompany the concert are great! I will still watch those a few more times -- probably not the concert."
3,Ringo star sings better than macca!,"Just a joke paul...bought this dvd hoping for something with a bit more sparkle...Paul Mcartney is one of the best vocalists around...maybe its because this dvd is more rock n roll orientated...thats why i dont feel fantastic inside over this dvd, but if you are from the Bill Hayley era of time then this ones a hit for you...The bonus features swayed me into finding this dvd acceptable... maybe a few more hours playing this disc might convert me a little more...shame paul didnt sing a few old beatle hits...so macca you read this its RINGO 1 MACCA 0NEARLY AS BAD AS EVERTON 4 LIVERPOOL 0..."
4,A great rock performance!!!,"Is really exciting to see McCartney live with a really basic band configuration! But don't get me wrong, the band is great, with David Gilmour and Ian Paice in the back!Great DVD, is a must!"
4,Back to the roots,"Outstanding show...I have seen McCartney live 7 times and have all of the recent live tour dvd's. I was reluctant to get this one because the songs are mostly old cover songs I guess from the late 50's and early 60's. I was very pleased and excited by this performance and the quality of the dvd. It is very straight forward with none of the usual fluff that you find on dvd's like the Space Between Us, Live from Red Square and Paul is Live. Those all have way to many to shots of the audience singing along to the songs (I don't buy concert dvd's to see middle aged people proving that they know the words to Get Back) or have intertwined interviews that should be an extra feature that doesn't not interrupt the concert. This has none of the fluff and is a better show because of it... Must have for McCartney fans."
2,great fit but cause rash,We brought our baby home and used the pampers from the hospital. We had several leaks with these and switched to the newborn huggies and they fit wonderfully. However after about 2-3 weeks I noticed the baby had a diaper rash we just couldn't get to heal no matter which creams or how much we air dried him. We were also using huggies wipes and as soon as we stopped using the wipes and the diapers the rash went away within a day. We tried the wipes and diapers separately since then and again they start a rash within a couple of days. I am very disappointed because I really liked the way these fit.
5,Great gift idea for baby shower!,I sent this to my sister as a baby shower gift and she loved it. She received the first order at her shower and the second right after the baby was born. She was thrilled to have 160 diapers (two orders) waiting for her when she came back from the hospital. She was able to use these through the first two months with her newborn. And it's a great deal - I could not find a better price anywhere else.
3,super expensive,"When I purchased the diapers I thought Amazon always had decent prices and at a minimum would be the same as the store and hopefully cheaper. Unfortunately I found out that I paid a lot more for these diapers than I would have at any store near me.Oh well, lesson learned."
1,experience,"Poor delivery timing, substitution without permission. Due to outsourcing, poor communication and responses. Unable to correlate with ""out sourced"" customer service person because of poor communication and English.A totally rotten experience."
4,The Kobayashi Report,I think these earrings were at a pretty nice for how much they were at. Though I didn't buy them for myself. But either way they looked really nice.
1,Printing Problems,"I know that the content of this book is extremely helpful, based on my purchase of an earlier edition. The printing in this one, however, is nearly impossible to read because of the size of the font. I purchased one copy to give away and another to give to others as a reference from my library. Both have to be returned."
5,It's the best!!!,I never knew myself and the others before. This book has really openned my eyes. There are a lot of things you can learn from this book. I guarantee it ;)Thanks for someone special who purchased this book as a gift for me. This book is the best gift in my life. Thank you.
2,wouldn't advise it,it's not what i expected.....i only like one song from this album...that is come with me by jesika otherwise it's not soo hott..
1,Didn't work.,"This didn't work. The internal battery would not hold a charge. Bought to back to back, hopefully to get a good working version, both had the same issue. Never was able to contact the merchant about this issue. Did get a refund, but still not happy, since I didn't get what I needed. Was a waste of time."
1,Beware!! Embedded Adware/Malware,"This version is outdated. But much worse, when I started installing the software, my virus protection lit up like a Christmas tree. Foolishly, I assumed the software was safe and installed it anyway. Not only have I now deleted the original software and thrown the discs in the trash, I've now spent a month and more than the software cost me trying to get all the adware/malware off my computer."
1,rubbish,"It's a really bad book. I bought it cause I sat next to Charlie at a 2-5 NL game at the Venetian. He gave me his business card and raved about how he'd discovered some grand idea related to psychology. Don't worry, you're not missing anything, he didn't. But I discovered a solipistic megalomaniac."
2,Not Worth My Time,"The subtitle should have been:""What Lawyers Sometimes Talk About When They Indulge in Aimless Chatter"".Knowing a fair amount about lawyers, I was anxious to read the book.I kept waiting for the informative parts, but gave up halfway.Maybe the author quit interviewing lawyers and threw what hehad together to make a deadline for a promised 220 pages.And maybe he was more interested in ""style"" than information.This book could be edited from 225 pages to 75 without important loss.What was also disturbing to me was how many positive quotations by""readers"" were secured. There seems to be a system of mutual hypein the publishing industry.Maybe there's automatic deference for a law professor/poet.Can't be so bad ? Decide for yourself; read it if you have time to waste.If the book paints some realistic picture, then he should have radicallysummarized, rather than torture readers."
5,Easy to Install,My husband installed this cover in only 2 hours with 1 broken finger. It went together easily. Fit like a glove. He is very happy with this cover.
5,Storytime,My son loves to have this story read to him! The rhyming text and colorful illustrations are very appealing to both parents and children. What a great story!
2,It's fun but not that useful,"I think this is more of a gift present than a useful present.It's written by two non-dentists and although interesting as far as thinking about word choice, it just wasn't that useful. I think it's nice to have lying around the waiting room instead of New Ideas. But if you're looking for a good book to get little kids to take dental treatment then you'll learn a pain free needle technique and more specific information on how to approach a children in the book ""Building a no-fear dental practice"" which IS written by dentists. A pediatric specialist even. Who USED to do all the restraining of kids and now uses general anaesthetic on only 1% of his cases. That's pretty amazing."
5,Erle Stanley Gardner Forever,"I have been reading and collecting Erle Stanley Gardner books for all of my adult life, and I'm going to be 68 soon. THE BLONDE IN LOWER SIX, by itself, is novel length and an excellent story about Ed Jenkins, The Phantom Crook, who was one of ESG's most popular characters and who appeared numerous times in Black Mask Magazine, most recently in 1945. THE BLONDE IN LOWER SIX somehow was misplaced for nearly twenty years and was then published in the September 1961 issue of Argosy. Caroll & Graf's edition was published BAC [Before Amazon.Com] and was gone before I knew about it. I have searched for it for twenty years and, incredibly picked it up in hardcover from an Amazon vendor [Bear Lakes] for only 72 cents plus shipping! An excellent and worthy addition to my collection!"
5,Enthusiasm Makes The Difference,Outstanding help and advice for those feeling beat down or up against things. Practical advice from a practical man.
1,Teaching Children art,Required book for a masters degree program. All the pictures are very dated. It is very dry and uninteresting to read. I will never use this book again once I graduate this program.
4,First time listener,"The first time I heard Mikel Erentxun was today while I was driving and had opened a Christian radio station in Lubbock Tx. Normally an english speaking radio station,KJAK, but on this Saturday morning,they were doing this one broadcast in Spanish. I heard a song and then the excited spanish speaking DJ raving about Mikel. But being only partially fluent in Spanish I could not make the last name of the artist. Later in the day, I went to a local bookstore and not knowing the artist full name, I came across this Mikel Erentxun CD and bought it on the off chance it may contain the song I heard...and well as I sit here listening to it right now, I love it! I am sure this is the artist I heard on the radio but I haven't heard the right song. But now I am going to have to buy some of his other CD's. If you don't listen to latin music or Christian artists but like good melody, harmony, smooth vocals, good guitar, this works! Instant music connection."
4,The rating is falling,"As a new gardener, I got all three weeders based on reviews and recommendations from friends. It's not at all as sharp as I thought it would be. I keep returning to a basic hoe for weeding. If my level of enjoyment does not pick up, I expect this rating could slide an extra notch."
3,Not as big as I thought,"Used to use a wider one in my old landscaping job but, it works about the same and is a little easier to use if i remember right."
2,Country of origin,Ordered two of these.They are Made in CHINA.It would be nice if Amazon listed the country of origin.
3,wing weeder,"easy to use, but is rather light wait, wonder if it will lastnext time I would buy Floral Union Weeding Hoes"
5,Traditions Powder Flask,"A good, serviceable item at a reasonable price and excellent delivery. The flask itself is solid, well-made, and aesthetically appealing. The screw in powder measure, which you should never use for loading *wink, wink* holds 30 grains of FFFg black powder."
5,A memorable and high quality friend for a very fortunate little pianist,"This is an awesome metronome made in Frankfurt, Germany. The only complain is that it is made of solid plastic, not solid wood. Other than that, this is a solid good high quality equipment. My 6 year old pianist loves it, it is a great motivation for her to play piano with her ""William the Owl Metronome"" as she names it. It brings heart to the piano practice, while this is a piece of good German craft. I highly recommend it. It will motivate your little one to no end. Check out my website: [...]"
5,I loved this movie,"It took me forever to finally find this movie and the funny thing is now they're playing it a lot after I haven't seen it for years on the TV. However, I'm so glad that I purchased this movie as it was one of my favorite movies a few years ago and still is."
2,Awkward,"Awkward. Forced. Not like anything that would ever happen, ever. As a fan of the Karate Kid films, this hurts my soul."
3,"Not terrible, but stick with the original","After the mixed success of the third Karate Kid movie, they decided to make another sequel, though this can't be considered part of a trilogy because Daniel is no longer part of the story, so Mr. Miyagi takes on a new student, a teen girl with anger issues (played by Hilary Swank) This is by no means an awful film, but this movie lacks the substance that made up Karate Kid I and II. Definitely a movie for renting, not buying."
2,Abit too contrived for my taste.,"Not a very good movie at all. The acting was average , the script was contrived and so was the plot. It was a boring movie. Sorry but i think it's time to stop with the wipe on wipe off bit."
2,don't go for it,I bought this for my son's collection. That's about all it's worth. Weak action scenes and history although it does break out of the typical model for KK movies.
4,well,just saw this movie two hours ago and it was not the best ive ever seen. john what were you thinking when you didn't direct this one. anyway the start was fun but the middle was a letdown.
4,Horrible film transcended by hot young talent,"Though ""The Next Karate Kid"" was an undeniably bad movie (Mr. Miyagi is Arnold from Happy Days, for Christ's sake!) it serves one much needed purpose: to serve as a springboard for promising young star Christopher Beam. Christopher propelled this movie foreward with his amazingly purposeful and affecting performance. His decidedly increible acting ability, combined with his boyish good looks, will surely launch his soon to be sizzling hot career."
1,HORRIBLE,"If there were anyway to give this movie -5 stars I would. Terrible acting and TERRIBLE story. Seen this story once, seen it a thousand times. Must say VERY disappointed. 2 Thumbs down plus everyone else I know that seen this movie, their thumbs down as well. I would avoid buying the box set JUST to not own this movie."
1,THEY WENT TOO FAR NOW,"THIS TIME AROUND, MR. MIYAGI [PAT MORITA] TEACHES A YOUNG GIRL [FUTURE OSCAR WINNER HILARY SWANK] SELF-DISCIPLINE AND MARTIAL ARTS. NOW, THIS WAS JUST TOO MUCH. THIS MOVIE IS SILLY, BORING, AND VERY UNNECESSARY. IF THEY EVER DO A 5TH KARATE KID MOVIE, I'LL BE SO DAMNED."
4,"&#65533;Fighting no good, but if must fight, win!&#65533;","The Next Karate KidMiyagi Yakuga (Noriyuki ""Pat"" Morita) is called on for help, by the widow of an old war buddy.She doesn't know what to do with her pretty but rebellious teenage granddaughter, after the recently orphaned girl was put in her care.Meanwhile the girl, Julie, has her own troubles with a gang of local thugs at her school, led by a sadistic sports coach, while keeping her pet, a lame hawk hidden in the school grounds.Her own love interest, a boy named Eric, is involved in the same battle with the gang called the Alpha elite.Mr Miyagi knows just what to do, and the first thing is to teach Judy some self-discipline and inner calm.The best line in the movie comes from Mr Miyagi, and isn't it the truth?`Fighting no good, but if must fight, win!'"
4,The Next Karate Kid,"During a commemoration for japanese soldiers fighting in the US Army during World War II Mr. Miyagi meets the widow of his commanding officer. He gets to know her granddaugther Julie, an angry teenager. She is full of pain about the death of her parents during an accident and has lots of problems with her grandmother and her fellow pupils. So Mr. Miyagi decides to teach her Karate to bring her back on the right way. This movie has an odd charm about it. Swank and Morita are a joy to watch, and I will watch it again."
4,"An Entertaining, Family Film","As a child, I always watched this movie with my father every time it was on TV. It is an interesting story in which an unhappy, somewhat rebellious teenager learns to deal with the pain of losing her parents. Through her friendship with Mr. Miyagi, she comes to respect herself by learning more about Karate and life in general. The only disappointment was that the ""military coach?"" at the high school was completely unbelievable. No American school would allow an employee to behave that way! Also, the ""Zen bowling"" scene was too silly for this type of movie! For these reasons, I gave the movie four stars instead of five. Overall, I thought it was an entertaining, family-friendly movie."
3,Excellent martial-arts flick!,"THE NEXT KARATE KID, in my opinion, is an excellent martial-arts flick. I thought that Eric (Chris Conrad) and Julie (Hilary Swank) looked good in their prom attire. Ned (Michael Cavalieri) was a real BULLY in my opinion. This was because he got Julie in trouble with Principal Wilkes (Eugene Boles). If you ask me, Colonel Dugan (Michael Ironside) was a pure A******! This was because he was a VERY harsh man who wouldn't tolerate mistakes. My favorite parts were the prom and the showdown between Julie and the Alpha Elite. In conclusion, I HIGHLY recommend this smash hit to all of you who like martial-arts flicks or are fans of Hilary Swank."
5,Best Racing Game,"This is the best racing game I've played on the PS3. Career mode lets you get in the spirit of Formula One, which is to say a cut-throat world where winning is the only thing that counts. I plan on buying one of those driving wheels to enjoy the realistic action even more."
3,Okay; but not up to the newer releases,"This game was okay (although my PS3 had some difficulty with it, it wasn't a problem with the game), but having tried the newer releases this one falls short in a lot of areas."
4,Just for F1 Fans,"yeah, as the tittle of my review says, it is just for fans... this game is alot of fun, the sound of the machines drives me crazy I LOVE 'EM... but sometimes ""realism"" in videogames goes to far... this game is like playing an actual F1 car, touch a single part out of the map and it fall apart to pieces (what really happens in real life) a game is supposed to be fun not stressing... anyway you can turn off the damage feature whenever you feel like it... overall I dont regret buying it and i bet you wont ^.^"
5,The Best PS3 Game so far,"I think this is the best game for PS3 so far,its so realistic and you car feel like a formula 1driver...the only bad thing about the game isLewis Hamilton is not in it."
3,Best F1 game ever,It's a nice raicing game but you may get bored.. For the F1 fans it's the best ever..
3,THE OPINIONATOR,"BY COMPARISON WITH GRAN TURISMO 5, I GUESS I AM SPOILED. ALSO I THOUGHT THIS GAME WAS A NEWER VERSION. WHEN I PUT IT IN TO LOAD IN MY SYSTEM A DATE POPS UP SHOWING 2006. ITS OK, BUT I EXPECTED MORE. I DO FIND SONY GAMES TO BE BETTER MATCHED WITH THIER OWN SYSTEM BY FAR, BETTER OVERALL."
3,"Far from perfect, the amount of flaws is off putting.","First of all, the game simulation is exactly like GT's which makes it fantastic. However, regardless of the TV you're using, some times during playing and in certain turns you find your self completely blinded by the stupid sun positioning in this game on most race tracks.Another con is the no-hand-break option, what that means is that you can't have total control over the F1. A third con that is a real big deal and a real off putter is the no gear number warning before each turn, what that means is, you're going 200 mbh and before the hard turn you get obsolutely no clues how fast or slow must you be for perfectly taking the turn.This game could've been phenomenal, especially for us ""car racing simulators fans""."
3,It's not heavy breathing,"It's great that O'Dette gives us the complete solo works, of course. I have the common reaction to O'Dette: his technique is flawless, his performance unengaging.Others have remarked on the ""heavy breathing"" noticeable on the recordings -- it's not heavy breathing, but the movement of his fingers on the gut strings making that sound."
2,Great playing. Bad recording quality.,"This is so disappointing. Paul O'Dette's musicianship is quite high here, but his artistry has been undermined by a very poor recording engineer. The sound is often muddy, with detail of O'Dette's playing frequently lost. Just sad. Compare to most of Lutz Kirchoff's recordings, which uniformly are detailed, distinct and wonderful. O'Dette really deserved better, particularly with a multi-disk set. It's suitable for background music, but not much else. Definitely not for careful listening with a quality sound system."
2,The ostentation of the brilliant researcher,"I have found A.S. Byatt's latest book most disappointing. One of your reviewers thinks that the brilliant, meticulous and extensive research in this book is like ""mayonnaise"" - I think it is more like an enormous diamond ring: impressive, valuable, beautiful but, ultimately, fairly ostentatious and valued more for its bulk than its contribution to whatever wrinkly hand it graces. Sorry Ms Byatt - I think the story line and character development need to be stronger in order to sustain all that encyclopaedic stuff. As you did with Possession and with Angels and Insects."
1,Spare me,"A. S. Byatt has written such fine books in the past, ""Possession"" being my favorite. Lately, she's writing dreck. Boring, pedantic, pointless. I tried hard. I read eighty pages before tossing it. Perhaps she's too buried in academia to remember what a good book is. It disappoints me that the literary establishment is willing to publish such stuff. It can't possibly sell. Let her publish it on the Internet if she wants an audience, but don't try to fool the book-buying public with it."
3,The beauty of words,"I greatly appreciate A. S. Byatt's books and have a deep reverance for the mind that can create her wonderful worlds. I didn't enjoy the characters and the basic plot of The Biographer's Tale as much as I have like most of her other books, but there were things here that I love very much. This book teams with history and myth and mystery, and that makes it wonderful to read, in much the same way that Possession was wonderful and assaulted the mind and the senses with the glory of words and the loveliness of the world.This is a book that makes you want to go and do research, if you have any scholarly inclinations at all. I know that Phineus Nanson begins his story by saying that he is giving up on words and needs things, but the irony of all of this is that his search for things takes him right back to research and to word-play."
2,one too many happy endings,"If you made a list of all the literary devices A.S. Byatt uses in The Biographer's Tale, it would look like a best of postmodern narrative. There are embedded stories, documents, theoretical discussions, and a double ending (happy both times). A.S. Byatt knows how to make a novel, I'm just not sure she has a real story to tell in this book. On the face of it, grad student Phineas Nanson leaves the academy to write a biography and finds love and adventure instead. It all feels extremely predictable and safe-from the sexual partnering to the debunking of contemporary postructuralist thought. Somewhere along the way a great idea for a novel about the contemporary state of the self became an exercise in literary structure."
3,Ambitious but ultimately a bit disappointing,"As a fan of Byatt's Possession, I very much looked forward to reading this book. I found intriguing, ambitious, but ultimately disappointing. Byatt wrote a bit of a comic novel of manners, a bit of a pastiche and critique of post-modern criticism, and a bit of an essay on the impossibility of the composition of a true and accurate biography. As a combination, or a piling up, of all these themes, The Biographer's Tale tries to accomplish too much.Still, there are some quite hilarious scenes, and I found the sections on Linnaeus, Galton, and Ibsen to raise fascinating questions about classification, biography, and the human condition."
1,disappointed - couldn't hear!,"This item's earpieces hurt my ears tremendously (too tight!) and I could hardly hear anything. I had to strain to hear my own heartbeat, and even then, it was extremely faint. Unfortunately, cannot recommend this."
5,I love this!,This is a great stethoscope! There are no difficulties with being able to hear patient heart/breath sounds.Remember: the weakest part of the stethoscope is between the earpieces!
3,Steth,Pretty cheap stethoscope. Value for money though ! Postage was worth more and product itself !
1,garbage,These subs are nothing better then paper weights. The first pair i got blew in a few days and the replacement they sent me had a sieged cone what a joke lol
1,Very Bad,Slow moving; bad acting; don't get it; don't rent it; don't look at it. Total waste of time. I could find no redeeming qualities about this movie.The only reason it even got one star was because I couldn't submit without it (and I really wanted to warn people). This movie was absolutely horrible!
1,Purchase At Your Own Risk,"This is one of the slowest-moving films I've ever seen. Quality movies that move at a snail's pace compensate with either stellar dialogue, well-developed characters or first-rate acting (""Driving Miss Daisy"" is a good example of a film with all those qualities). None of those things apply in this film. I watched the entire film with the hope that its climax/conclusion would engage me on some level. I'm saddened to say it didn't. In the end, ""Caged Terror"" was a major disappointment; I felt cheated and robbed. Even its low $6.99 sale price doesn't justify the purchase of this film. If you must see it, I recommend that this film be rented, and only from a DVD rental-by-mail service, so you won't have to pay the flat rental price."
1,garbage,"I AM REQUIRED BY HONESTY TO CONSIDER THAT THE EXCELLENT REVIEWS GIVEN THIS MOVIE ARE THE RESULT OF THE CRITICS HAVING UNKNOWN TUMORS IN THE PRE FRONTAL LOBES OF THEIR RESPECTIVE BRAINS.THE ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATION IS HALLUCINATION SECONDARY TO NERVE GAS ABSORBTION. IF YOU WERE GIVEN THIS CD FREE THEY OWE YOU MONEY FOR SEEING IT. IF,IT BEING A PLASTIC INSULATOR,WAS ABLE TO PROTECT YOU FROM A KILLING ELECTRICAL SHOCK IT STILL WOULD NOT BE WORTH BUYING. IT'S EXISTENCE IS A PERVISION OF COMMUNICATION BY MEDIA."
1,"Probably mislabeled, definitely overpriced","I suspect that this item is mislabeled. There is no need for a 'PS3' memory card whatsoever. The original PS3 models did have the ability to read memory sticks and other formats but this is no longer the case. Anyways, the idea behind the PS3 being able to read memory sticks was for someone to take it from a camera or some other device and 'stick' it into the PS3 to transfer photos or whatever other content. There isn't and there was never such a thing as a PS3 MEMORY CARD.And, since this is a memory card, for about the same amount that this item sells for, you can get a SanDisk stick that's FOUR TIMES as large:SanDisk 8GB Memory Stick Pro Duo."
1,How to Travel to Buenos Aires without Meeting Argentineans,"I'm considering a trip to Buenos Aires, so I've been checking out anything and everything related to it for any bit of context I can get. But this video is an utter waste of time even for a public library loan.It may be geared towards the rich and famous who want a sheltered and familiar experience, visiting upscale hotels and restaurants. But I can't imagine anyone not being irritated by the nauseatingly affected mannerisms of the host and Mary Dilts and Lauren Hutton (who appears as if she is trying to seduce the camera operator).Instead, I would wholeheartedly recommend Lonely Planet's Argentina video, regardless of your travel budget."
1,Not recommended,"I've got around 30 Zorn CDs, but sold this one on eBay (thanks, whomever you were!). Gotta say, I wanted to like this one--the cover art and liner notes made it sound like other Zorn albums that I love. Unfortunately, um, no.I'd have to put this in the listen-proof category. Not that it's grindcore or anything--just that the sounds are very unstructured and unpleasant. It's like an electronic-avant garde student effort, where the student is trying hard to make folks leave the room. Much like I did, when I was a student. But I woudn't want to listen to me either."
3,Real Border Patrol Action,"I first saw the movie in 1980 while a student at the Border Patrol Academy. I was trying to get an idea of what I was getting myself into. While the Border Patrol Agent's everyday on-duty life is not exactly as portrayed in the movie, this is the closest video to reality that is on the market. Charles Bronson is perfect for this role. In the movie, he is even wearing an old hat that a Border Patrol Agent gave him for the part. The USBP allowed the use of official emblems and badges and parts of the movie was filmed at an actual BP station. Of the three or four Border Patrol movies available, I think this one is the best."
5,Borderline,Charles Bronson is the Man. He is capable of doing a variety of roles . Here is the uncut movie. Too often tv channels chop this movie to the point that the story is altered. I loved being able to get it. Again thanks Amazon.
3,Maybe not a good idea to do this diet.,"The book says if you go off this diet you will gain a lot of weight easily, and I was on one like it in the past and became bored, went off it and gained easily. I am not looking to gain more weight, so I wouldn't try this diet unless you can stick to it forever."
2,Not much meat to it... pardon the pun,"Ray and his partner have an interesting theory. I don't know if it's right or wrong but I do know it's not practical. There was an interesting comment in the book where Ray said ""if you can't commit to this way of eating for the rest of your life then don't even try it."" Well Ray doesn't have to worry I won't even try it as he suggest. I have no problem giving up breads, potatoes, etc. but his meat solutions are very much impractical.This thin book doesn't cover enough facts to prove that while our diet has evolved our digestive track has not."
1,There are better low carb books out there...,"The diet information is fairly sound. But it is based on hypothesis and wishful thinking rather than sound scientific evidence.Also, the author's advice on weight training reflects his very shallow understanding of the subject. Does anybody really want training advice from a 6 foot, 160 pound pencilneck?"
1,Another low-carb snake oil book?,"It is not always the case that people who act in immature manner are under-educated. However, it is often the case that ""empty barrels make the most noise"". People who have credentials in the health field, who have done research, and who are thinkers have no need to act in a particular manner.Raymond Audette regularly posts to the usenet/google group alt.food.vegan for the sole purpose of disrupting conversations and angering people.In my opinion if Audette was a true researcher, had credentials that would qualify him for writing a book on nutrtion and his diet was based on fact he would have better things to do with his time.Hitching his wagon late to a diet fad that every major scientific body condems, his lack of credentials, and his behaviour in alt.food.vegan makes me seriously doubt the potential value of the content of this book."
5,Worked for me,I have been fighting allergies for 12 years with little success. Allergists never could pin down what was causing the problem. I was getting sinus infections every few months. I rarely felt well enough to exercise and my glucose and cholesterol started to shoot up. Eventually I was taking medications for both the glucose and cholesterol but they were still too high. 3 months ago I started this diet. I felt better after 2 weeks. I was able to start regular exercise again. I was concerned about the cholesterol but when I went last week for my blood test my cholesterol was cut in half. My glucose was cut in half. My HDL/LDL ratio was much better. All my blood readings were back in normal. My doctor could not believe it. If I maintain these results next time we will start reducing the medications. In addition I lost 5 pounds. I'm convinced that it works.
5,Good book; not just about losing weight,"Adopting the Paleolithic Diet is more than just about losing weight, but about feeling better, having more sustained energy, and breaking out of the grain-carbohydrate-allergy cycle that many people suffer from.One reviewer complained about inaccuracies in the science behind Neanderthin; problems & fine points of the science have been discussed elsewhere and will no doubt be corrected in subsequent editions.But the fact remains that Neanderthin works! In four months I shed that pound-a-year flab that had accumulated since leaving college, I have more sustained energy, and am free from lifelong grain-and milk-caused allergies.I recommend Neanderthin most wholeheartedly! We are raising our two-year-old daughter the Neanderthin way."
5,Neanderthin- 2 million years old and going strong!,":Neanderthin cuts a swathe through the medical mysteries of obesity and chronic disease. It clearly shows how our health problems relate to major changes in the diet some 10,000 years ago. It holds aloft a new gold standard in nutrition- the Paleolithic Diet, the diet of ancient man. The Paleolithic Diet is 2 million years old and looking stronger than ever.The new edition is expanded with more detail on the relationship of food and disease, what to eat, how to go about the diet, an easy to follow exercise program and more recipes.Ray Audette's personal odyssey is inspiring. His history of nutrition is fascinating. His explanations for obesity, arthritis and other diseases are convincing.If you diet hasn't given you the results you need, grab Neanderthin and go for it. It certainly worked for me."
4,"Reply to ""Mr"" from Cambridge","There is a reason why you feel light-headed and faint after 4 to 5 days on a low-carb diet. When you eat lots of carbohydrates, your body uses carbohydrates as fuel. When you cut the carbo intake to the levels suggested by low-carb diets, you no longer eat enough carbs for fuel. Your body responds by going into ketosis, to burn fat. But this is *not* an instantaneous process. It take a day or two, maybe three, for your body shift its metabolic gears. So for a few days, you feel sluggish. Then when Ketosis finally kicks in, you get your energy back. From what you've written, you gave up at exactly the wrong time. Next time, stick it out. Trust me on this."
3,There are better books available,"A low-carb, adequate protein diet has been of great benefit to me. However, Neanerthin is not the best book to read if you are interested in this approach to nutrition. Protein Power by Drs. Michael and Mary Eades is a far superior book, their explanations of how the diet works and its relationship to common medical conditions are clear and compelling. Their clinical experience gives them a depth and breadth of experience that enhances their credibility.I found Audette's arguments and explanations in Neanderthin to be rather muddled and unconvincing, more dogmatic than substantive. However, the book contains some useful material and the bibliography was informative.At best, this book should be used as a supplement to Protein Power."
5,Hunt and gather this book!,"Finally a book where having a degree in medical anthropology came in handy!If you've been hearing all the hype about the low-carb diets - get this book. Neanderthin will make you understand the basis for these diets and why they work - Neanderthin is our natural way of eating.Besides the wonderful history of the human diet (and when the diet-related health problems started to creep up), I enjoyed the common-sense Neanderthal exercise program. Even couch spuds will realize that your body is meant to move, but exercising doesn't have to leave you out of breath and begging for relief.If you're committed to feeling better overall as well as losing weight, this book is a must have.Kudos to Audette for going against the grain (no pun intended), healing himself and others through this book."

5,The is 100% Great in my Book!,"I found this complete CD and it is sooooooooooo hot!! I luv it! I wish I knew about it loooong tine ago when it was suppose to come out! I can't explain! It is a rare R&B jewel!!! If U liked his first CD, then you'd definitely like this one! Another great LaFace artist who is truly underrated! He's a talented singer and songwriter!"
5,The Best Peter Ever,"Iñaki Gabilondo possesses a miraculous voice; no other ""Peter and the Wolf,"" in any language that I have ever heard, matches this one for richness and inflection. This would be a wonderful teaching tool for Spanish students."
5,A new look at some classic tunes,"These are mostly demo songs, some of which were never relased, from Wait's early years (no kidding). Some of the songs on here, such as ""I Hope I Don't Fall In Love With You"" and ""Ol' 55"", would go on to become classics. Some of these songs are actually better than the versions that were put on the albums, especially ""Shiver Me Timbers,"" here turned into a piano-ballad romp, rather than the jazzy outting featured on HEART OF SATURDAY NIGHT. THE EARLY YEARS, VOLUME 2 offers a good introduction into Waits's early music (sparse arrangements, beautiful lyrics), and is also a handy addition to previously-existing Waits collections."
3,IN DARK PLACES,"This was a good book once it got going, but was a little slow in the beginning. And sometimes it was hard to follow the plot."
4,Suspense,Everything was good.I had a good experience and everything was good and it arrived on time. No problems. I would order again from this company. The book had a good story line and kept me interested.
4,A Thrilling Read,I stumbled upon Michael Prescott by accident and read Last Breath. That was so good that I decided to read all his books. In Dark Places is a fast-paced read. The plot is creative with lots of twists and turns. It will keep you guessing until the very end.
4,In Dark Places,"As with all Michael Prescott Books this one was excellent and a ""could not put down"" story. Can't wait for more books from him."
3,chord-change and melody geeks unite,"Defintely for fans of clever, sunny pop, with thick washes of shameless sythesizer, fancy arrangements and Ryan Olcott's assertive singing and brainy/silly lyrics. It's to their credit that even when a song starts out too goofy, they always redeem themselves with stong melodies and the rest of it. Todd Rundgren's production credit buried somewhere deep in the insert, I would've thought he'd insist on more play. Good job Todd and Rods."
3,A Sad Thing For Sure....CD Has Only 7 of 11 Tracks.,"While the music itself is good, there are only 7 out of the 11 tracks listed on this CD. ""A Sad Thing"" isn't on it and in it's place is ""Blues For Tomorrow"" a song done by the East Coast All-Stars! The songs listed on the music samples; St. Louis Blues, Lets Dance, Tenderly, and Strike Up The Band, are nowhere to be seen! Someone at Riverside was really a sleep at the wheel on this one. I have seen this CD on other sites with the same 11 tracks listed but I am sure it's a mistake as well. I wanted this for ""A Sad Thing"" but now I'm sad!"
2,Herbie Mann on Base Clarinet,"For the longest time Joe Zupan the afternoon jazz host on WICN out of Worcester, Massachusetts would play selections from this project, and having seen Europe on base clarinet I had to get it. It came out about a year ago and I'm disappointed. His base clarinet work is filled with tentatively disjointed improvisation making for unexciting lines. Jack Sheldon saves the session for me. Now, on that same project Herbie masterfully on flute plays Strike Up the Band. For that I give 10 stars."
5,Quintessential 1990s UK music that amuses and frightens,"Some hardcore Fall fans sneer at this one, claiming the cover versions were better than the Fall originals. Rubbish! The opener, ""Ladybird"", is pure Mark E Smith whimsy wrapped up in a thunderous Hanley/Scanlon riff. ""Glam-Racket"" is a Bowie-Glitter hybrid that rattles the windows. ""Service"", with its Bach trumpet-style synthesiser and rumbling piano cords, is so evocactive of a dark English street you can almost feel the damp. Everyone will have their favourite cover. Their surprise reworking of Sister Sledge's ""Lost In Music"" opens up new dancefloor avenues. My personal fave is ""I'm Going To Spain"", a Eurovision failure that Smith turns into a pop masterpiece, while Smith's interpretation of Lee Perry's ""People Funny Boy"" is a faithful celebration of the strong bond between reggae and rock forged by Bob Marley. A classic Fall party album which makes you dance while diagnosing more symptoms of the English Disease."
5,One Of The Best & Most Underrated Fall Classics,"Take away track twelve ""The Monkey Moon Mix"" and this is a perfect record. The first five tracks are outstanding culminized by the phenomenal ""It's A Curse"" which despite being about a minute too long is one of my all time favorite Fall tracks. The Infotainment Scan is the first release after Brix Smith either left or was booted out of the band and despite her absence the polished sound that she helped to develop is quite evident. One of the highlights is a cover song called ""I'm Going To Spain"" which if you surf the net can be found on a compilation record of the ten worst songs ever written. Personally I've never heard the origibnal bit Mark E. Smith somehow mangaged to take what apparently was a piece of crap and turn it into what sounds like an all-time radio classic (although ironically the song never really received any airplay). As I said one of my favorite Fall cd's and well worth the money spent."
2,"Not a bad album, but there's nothing new about this one","I always protested when people say that one Fall album sounds exactly like any other Fall album. It simply isn't true. Well, eccept for this one. It#s not precisely a bad album, but it sounds so much like the one before it and the one after it that if you have either ""Code Selfish"" or ""Middle Class Revolt"" and are not a hardcore fan or collector you need not worry about this one at all. I am a diehard Fall fan, and this one bored me stiff."
5,superb music,"I always considerd Waldo de los Rios as one of the very great conductors, certainly his LP'S were always a delight to listen to, now we have the chance to hear these wonderful recordings on this double cd set, what a joy, worth every cent of your money"
4,Diorissimo found!,"I have loved Diorissimo perfume for 20+ years and was heartbroken when Dior stopped making it. To find a bottle which still smells fresh and true was a great surprise. I love this scent for the memories of spring that it always brings. It smells of lily of the valley, lilac and hyacinth, all just after a spring rain. Just lovely. I feel almost like I shouldn't tell anyone about this, because there is undoubtedly a very limited supply available and I want it ALL. But I am very satisfied with this purchase and will purchase it again, if I can find some."
1,Not what I expected,"I ordered this item because I used to have this wonderful fragrance before. I love the lilly of the valley aroma but this spay is too diluted, so the fragrance doesn't stay long, and the aroma is not that good quality.I am disappointed."
3,Nice but smell before you buy,"Just a tiny thing to add to other reviews that are more articulate about the scent: whatever flowers are involved, this is very sweet to me. We have bought this for years as a gift to someone who wears it as her signature perfume and cologne, and it is pretty unforgettable to me. It is way too sweet for me, and like Estee or Beautiful or pleasures or Eternity, can be easily overdone and smell up a room. I have grown more sensitive to smells as I age, but I would definitely suggest smelling and wearing this before you buy a large size."
1,"do not like scent, no returns allowed","The problem of ordering this type of item on Amazon is that if you do not like the scent (or for any other reason) you cannot return the item. Although this is stated in the product description, it is surprising as most items from Amazon can be returned. In this case I did not notice the non-return disclosure."
3,Perfume,"I loved the original DIORISSIMO perfume by Christian Dior. This version has hardly any fragrance and the ingredients seem to be different. I don't think it has any Lily of the Valley in it any more, which used to be the main ingredient."
2,Be prepared to spent $ fixing tv often,"We have had our tv for less than four years and are having to replace the bulb for the third time. TV is great when it works, but the bulbs go out often, ($150 a pop, minimum). Forget the warranty package. I can't even get anyone to pick up the phone. Message comes on stating they are closed, but call back later. Sadly, they don't say when they are open. I wouldn't recommend this product."
4,New but incomplete,"It is missing pages, pages I need to be able to read that aren't there. Kinda upset.The book came as described minus the mention of the missing pages."
5,Close to writing perfection,"The Lamy 2000 fountain pen not only feels perfect in your hands but delivers writing performance unmatched with anything at this price pont. I love it and being a pen aficionado, I've got a bunch of different pens which all deliver in bunches. That said, the one I keep coming back to is the 2000. Not the most expensive but pure writing pleasure.Highly recommended."
4,interesting,An interesting course and one you will find that you really willlearn Russian quickly. I would really like the CD to speak ALL the Russian text in the book as I find learning by ear much easier than by reading.
3,Its all in the title,"I ordered this book after taking A&P as I enjoyed A&P very much and also like history. The contents are straightforward and explained in the title. I enjoyed the Singer book on the same topic more, however."
3,Buyers beware!,Enjoyed the movie with my kids. However it was advertised as having widescreen format but it only comes in full screen. If you are a widescreen buff as I am this will be a disappointment.
4,Gramdpa's Will,"His grandpa pass away, leave him with Twins. He has trouble in school with some of math. Great Baseball movie."
5,Outstanding guide to Colorado county highpoints.,"Mitchler and Covill have hit a home run with their new book, Hiking Colorado's Summits. This book is an excellent and comprehensive guide to ascending the high points of Colorado's 63 counties. The book is a well-researched and informative guide that leaves no stone unturned in providing Colorado travelers, hikers, and mountaineers with accurate and detailed information to help make their ascents of Colorado's county highpoints more successful and more fulfilling. In addition to the road and trail descriptions, Mitchler and Covill provide interesting historical information about each county as well as other things to see and do near each highpoint. I wholeheartedly recommend this book for anyone who would like to see and enjoy the entire state of Colorado and who would like to maximize their Colorado experiences. Anyone who completes ascents of all Colorado county high points will complete the ""grand slam"" of Colorado climbing."
5,Of Pilots and shattered dreams...,"One need look no further than the back cover of this book, and at the picture of the man that wrote it, to be able to comprehend what this memoir meant to him. Thirty some odd years later, the steely glare seems to say ""I still have unfinished business. 78 1/2 missions wasn't what I was sent ther for..."" A short one, but filled with ""I was there"" stories that anyone can relate to, and appreciate. An excellent account of flying and fighting in an unpopular war. We are lucky to have such warriors in our midst."
4,"A great, exhilirating ride","The only negative I have on this book is the horrible typesetting and editing; its horsey type and amateurish layout looks like it was ditto-copied from a bad PC manuscript, and the book is riddled with spelling errors and malapropisms. This one could definitely use a reprint and graphic upgrade.On the other hand, the story is excellent, giving the reader lots of action, and a good insight into the frustrations, fears and challenges the Vietnam pilots must've felt.A quick, brisk read, laced liberally with the ""you are there"" details that grognards crave."
3,Very educational,I started in this book then realized that maybe I should've gone to school for a degree in astromony to understand some of the technical terms used in this book. Very interesting though once I started really into it and took time to study what was being said. Thank you!
4,Good investment,"This Video card was a great advance for me. I had a FX5200 and it's obvious the huge gap between these two cards. I was planning to buy a new computer instead of buying a new graphic card, but when I was searching a new one I realized that this video card was capable of giving another live to my Pentium IV 3Ghz and 1Gb Ram."
5,"If you know someone with a drinking problem, buy this book for them !","This is a very inspirational book. After reading this, I cut my monthly beer intake in half. Just read the first chapter and you will see what I mean. Mandatory reading for anyone with a drinking problem."
4,Great game for it's genre,"I liked it to start because it had no monthly fee. I was tired of paying a monthly fee for a game or 2, and couldn't add another.I was surprised, the avatars are animated nicely, and plenty of flashy things to wear and fight with."
2,French Style Butter Keeper,"Thought this would be great idea but was disappointed, because way too small & need to remember to change water [easy to forget] or butter will turn bad"
4,"Great character development, gripping ending","I am not a fan of historical fiction, but I found this book to have all the things I look for in good fiction. It gives the reader a unique glimpse of both sides of World War II. One becomes involved in the conflicts experienced by both heroes. And the last chapters grab the reader and won't let go till the end."
4,A masterful tapestry of history and fiction,"Although I must confess that I am biased (I am the author's daughter), I found the book to be thoroughly fascinating. The author masterfully weaves fact with fiction to not only hold the reader's attention with a powerful story, but to also give some interesting insight and perspective on the events of World War II. You won't want to put it down until you've finished the last chapter."
5,This is a very appropriate book that describes ADHD,"I loved this book and so did my children who all have ADHD. It was extremely helpful. My children were so relieved to find out that they were not alone in their feelings, and that their was someone out there who they could relate to. They love this book and it has generated many questions from them. This book is appropriate for many ages. I gave itto my children's teachers, who requested a book that was appropriatefor the classroom and once they read it, they wanted to order theirown copy. It is child friendly ad very well illustrated. It is gentlenatured and informative. It allows your child to actually understandwhat is going on with them. This is a good book, that your child willask you to read it again and again."
3,This was not a good fit for our situation,This is a good book and has a good message but is not the right book for my son. He is a 1st grader and recently diagnosed ADHD. And even after extensive testing they say he is borderline and is only a 50/50 chance that is what is causing his lack of attention. Hard to tell if he is just a high energy boy who is young for his grade and therefore a little more imature. Time will tell.But again this book didn't fit for us so I never ended up reading to him. He is doing great academically and socially. Only issue is with sitting still and getting independent work done. And with this book I didn't want to introduce him to the idea or worry of other potential problems that aren't part of his experience.Still trying to find a book for children that introduces the concept and basic ideas about AD/HD without seeming like the child is doing something bad or something is wrong with them.
4,"a pretty, but smaller teaspoon","Purchased this set to supplement my existing flatware set. Nicely made and hasn't shown any sign of spots or rust in the dishwasher (after 2 months). However, these spoons are about 1/4 smaller than the teaspoons that came with my flatware set, so they not a perfect match. I do believe that my set is the typical teaspoon size. The spoons are narrow at the tip and work well for grapefruit or other scooping functions. I do like the shape, I just wish the spoon held a bit more...hence 4 stars instead of 5."
2,Too Small,"These suction cups appear much larger in the product description. They are too small to be of much use to me. The company that sold them through Amazon did refund me for them except for the shipping and I did not even have to return them. Even though I did not like the product, the company treated me right."
1,listen to the reviews and go elsewhere,"Per another reviewer, these items have a sticky film on it, which is quite gross. I do not want to put on my window, until I try to remove the sticky stuff. I think the reason is because the product is so old. It has Dayton Hudson on the label and says 1999 on it. I believe the name Dayton Hudson stopped being used in 2000, and went just to Target. Old product, spend your money elsewhere."
1,DON'T BUY!,"First of all, these things are TINY. But that's not even the problem. They are covered with this nasty grime that leaves a coating on your fingers and on the window/surface. And to top it all off, they don't even stick to the window. They fall of the second you remove your fingers. I think the grime is intended to be the adhesive aspect of this product, but it doesn't really work."
3,"Effective, but noisy.","I bought this because I needed a small, battery-powered fan for the windowless master bathroom in my townhouse. It does look great, and it is endlessly adjustable, but a previous review is right on the money about the noise: at all but the lowest speed it is very noisy. I couldn't imagine using this at work, but for my purpose I can deal with the noise. I also agree with the weird airflow comment, but I still find the fan effective: it took some experimenting to find the angle that worked, but it does the job I purchased it for. I think $30 is about as much as I'd be willing to pay for it, but I haven't seen any other battery-powered fans this size."
1,By far the worst internet sales experience I've ever had,"I ordered this book 12/19/08 and received a package 12/31 that was the wrong book (on a completely different topic). I emailed a question to the seller, never heard back, emailed again a week later and received a rapid response that my email would be promptly looked into. Never heard back from the seller. Don't buy from this company."
2,Don't waste your time,"This book was written before the passing score was raised to 82%. On the test, you will find questions on Unix files, UARTs, and tranceivers. These topics are barely covered or not covered at all in this book. I recommend that you read either Mellisa Craft or David Groth's book if you really want to pass. Good luck"
3,Not quite the book I was hoping for.,"As a technical instructor I am always looking for new material for the classroom to enhance the teaching and learning process. While this book does provide coverage of the Network+ exam is falls a little short for the classroom.There is over 600 pages of material and the material does cover the exam objectives completely. Topics like data communications and transmission, modems, the OSI model, 802 standards, TCP/IP, subnetting, WAN routing and protocols, security and satellite communications.At the end of each chapter there is review questions and multiple choice questions and the lab manual included has exercises that coincide with each chapter of the book. The cd included use the exam gear testing software with over 500 questions.I think if the author combined the lab manual with the book, added more coverage to routing and switching, included network operating systems like NT, UNIX, Novell and Linux than this book goes to the top."
1,original is better,"If you want UNCUT ORIGINAL version, ALWAYS look for ORIGINAL LICENSED Production. NOT US Release. Its a foreign film, it should not be US version to begin with~! HELLO!!!?? Why settle for LESS with US Version where they edit and cut so many excellent scenes especially with Jackie's Fighting Scenes. And US Release ruins the speed and sound as well. I have been collecting JET Li movies both HK and US Release Version for quite some time now. I found HK Version to be MUCH MORE in enjoyable, and HIGHER in Quality. American Market always like to ""Americanize"" and ""Control"". Regional Code Regulation thing is one of the example to CONTROL the Market. Why not let everyone enjoy the same HK Original Release move the same way REST OF THE WORLD enjoys it ?? No one makes Hollywood American movies to ""French version"" or ""Chinese Version"" ~! This what Americans are doing~! Well, enjoy the cheap ""American version"" then~! LOL"
2,Definitely his worst film,"This movie has decent fight scenes but no real plot. I can't believe that Bridget Fonda agreed to do this film.There is one scene where Jet Li is running from the bad guys and he just so happens to walk in on a karate class. The karate instructor (who doesn't have any idea who this man is) for no reason yells ""Fight!"", and all the karate students try to take on Jet Li at once. Of course he wins. ..."
1,2 hours of my life I'll never get back...,This is one of those movies where they cram all the good scenes from the movie into the theatrical trailer. What you see in the trailer is pretty much all there is to see. Horrible story and excessive violence to make up for the horrible storyline. Bridget Fonda unfortunately hits a new low in her career with this one...
4,Three times is a charm...,"This is Jet Li's third movie in the United States, and I must say...this is probably his best so far. It doesn't disappoint in the action area...within the first fifteen/twenty minutes of the movie you are already off and running with Jet Li through a hotel in Paris into a web of deceit and intrigue. The plot is actually quite easy to follow and is well conceived. A Chinese undercover agent caught in the web of a dirty French cop (Tceky Karyo), and a down trodden American prostitute (Bridget Fonda)plays an unlikely side-kick who is Li's only salvation to clearing his name.The martial arts action is non-stop...and yes highly plausible...no hidden wires here. The fighting scenes in the police station are incredible; stick fighting, wu shu, tae kwon do...you name it.Overall, there is a good balance between action and drama. Something that isn't always easy to come by with many action flicks today. I firmly believe that this movie solidifies Jet Li's stardom in the U.S.A."
4,"A better script to be desired, but good action","Granted this movie isn't the best I've ever seen, I wouldn't call it the worst either. This movie was refreshing in that it was old-fashion, hardcore-action fist-to-cuffs. No wires or flying like all the movies seem to be doing these days, at least American made films since they've been doing it in HK films as far as I can remember. This movie, as pointed out by Jet Li, is more about one man's promise than anything else. Which, I admit, if you were to watch the movie, it gets a little muttled, but not entirely. Sure, I think this movie is pretty cool,[...]."
3,Typical Action Adventure Movie,"I had great expectations when I saw 2 new Jet Li movies where going to be nationally released last year. Unfortunately, neither aimed to impress. Don't get me wrong, Li is one of the best action stars of today, and if you think that's wrong, you really ought to see the Once Upon a Time in China series. His movies are often done with wires or special FX, which is not my cup of tea, but I enjoy his fighting skills anyway. There were all of maybe 4 or 5 fight scenes in KotD, and even though the the ""La Fayette"" French Soldier from the patriot is the main villian, it doesn't do much for the movie, or the ending for that matter. I'd recommend a rental, unless you are a die hard fan. Then you can pick this one up on it's cheaper format, VHS."
4,What can I say,"Well, all I can say is that I enjoyed this movie tremendously! This is definitely one DVD you would like in your collection. The martial arts coreography was great! I even liked the story line. Get some popcorn and enjoy."
3,A blood soaked screenplay...,"For a film in this genre (we all know that Jet Li is a genre all is own), `Kiss of the Dragon' actually excels in many areas. Script is not one of them, and the dialog is borderline atrocious, but the action sequences and the stunning mood of the film really does wonders for making it a more than mere serviceable film. This is exciting and dark and rapturous in many instances, and while moments can drag a tad (like those gaps between poundings) those moments seem frivolous when you factor in the intensity derived from the many expertly paced action sequences. `Kiss of the Dragon' is one of Jet Li's more brutal offerings, and so don't expect a `fun' fight sequence. These fight sequences are gory and IN YOUR FACE, but that's what we want sometimes. So, turn off your brain and soak in the violence. Oh god, this sounds so wrong, but sometimes we just want to see people get beat up...right? No one does that with more flare than Jet Li!"
4,the fastest hands in the east,Jet Li is probably the best martial artist/actor around.i like the movie with good action fight scenes.
2,Kinda bad,"I think this is the best Hollywood movie Jet Li has done, but its not enough fight scenes, and when there are, they are worthlessly filmed and not to good choregraphed. Hollywood just cant make martial arts movies right.My advise to him would be: Forget hollywood and do like Bruce Lee, produce and direct your own movies."
2,What??,The worst Jet Li film I have ever seen. I have watched every jet li movie there is ( including all HK films) and this is by far the worst. The only reason I gave it two stars is because its jet li!
1,What are these other people thinking?,"I went to see this movie looking for an average to good action film. The movie I saw barely rated 1 star. Poor plot, unbelievable action scenes, and characters that would be considered over the top in a comic book! Save your money on this one. Rental only!"
2,Martial-arts film has little substance...,"Jet Li is good, but he's no Jackie Chan. Heck, he's not even a Van Damme yet. But he's getting there. He's learning. ""Kiss of the Dragon"" is one of hopefully a few mistakes that Li will make in his just-beginning career. The film's plot is confusing and, if understood, boring. The film makes no effort what-so-ever in making an actual good story. Instead, we jump from fight scene to fight scene dodging huge plot holes and receiving dumb dialogue. The fight scenes are mostly pretty good, especially a random scene where Li fights off a troupe of ninjas. But the film lacks interesting characters and Bridgette Fonda's terrible acting doesn't help the film at all. I like Jet Li. I know he can do better. Hopefully this won't be a big step down in his career."
1,Dark Is The Jet,"Maybe I'm getting old, but this DVD was so brutal, violent, bloody, depressing, etc. that I stopped watching it about half way through. I have several Jet Li movies, all the Once Upon A Time In China flicks. I admit Jet's moves are great, but whatever message he planted in the story (which he wrote)sank somewhere in all the gratuitous violence and language. Don't buy this unless you enjoyed the Texas Chain Saw Massacre."
5,pretty darn good movie and it is directed by some white guy,"JEt Li is very good in this movie. Romeo Must Die..i must say, TRASH!!! this is more like Jet Li. Non-stop action with some touching momentsJet Li and Bridgette Fonda make this movie very interesting and i liked it that they did not fall in love because that would not make sense and that is WHAKc!storyline is pretty followable.Jet Li is chinese cop that is sent to Paris fo some reason, then corrupted French cop frames him for murder.the last fight with the 2 white twins are very good.this would be about ranked B considering it is from Jet LI."
3,Not too good and not too bad,Reasons you should see this movie:1. Jet Li fans will love the awesome fighting scenes that every Jet Li movie has to offer. There's even a scene where he fights about 50+ karate guys in a sort of Bruce Lee style.2. The ending of the movie is pretty cool.Resons not to see it:1. There's a fairly graphic scene with prostitutes that is inappropriate for minors.2. The film is very gory and violent.Bottom Line: See this movie if you are a fan of Jet Li and his former movies. It's not all that much different from the rest of them.
1,I hate Jet Li,"This movie really was terrible. Jet Li is just a short little chinese man and the movie just sucked. What really made me mad is at the end when the bad guy gets killed from the kiss of the dragon needle. His punishment just doesn't fit the crime. It's also stupid how Jet Li goes out of his way to help a prostitute (Bridget Fonda) and save her little daughter. It already made me made the way the bad cop died in the end by stupid Jet Li, but I would have been more mad if Bridget Fonda was a super hot lady and Li killed the awesome bad guy the way he did at the end. How much unrealistic can you get? All the stupid chinese man does in the movie is put needles into people."
2,Very Disappointing,"This pictures has so many inconsistencies that it makes the movie unwatchable. I really wanted to enjoy this movie, since Jet Li is just fabulous. But the film editing really made it hard to understand the plot, or why the villains acted they way they did. Had this movie had 10 minutes more in the beginning to setup the rest of the picture, it could have been really good. But throughout the movie I found myself saying out loud, ""He didn't say that earlier in the pciture so how would she know"", or ""What is going on here"", or ""What a waste of film."" Ugh..."
3,Kiss my dragon,"I donn't know about everyone else but I like kung fu movies to cut back on the blood and just have kung fu. I don't like gun shooting and blood spraying everywhere, I just want to see the cool looking martial arts. Well this one definitely has cool martial arts but there was just way too much brutal killing for me. I like martial arts movies like the one and the legend. Kiss of the dragon is more for a meltdown fan."
2,I agree with the first two reviewers,"The first two reviewers did a great job of describing the storyline, so I won't go there. I'll tackle the ending...WHAT ENDING? I even backed it up to see what I missed. THEN, I went to the special features to see an alternate ending. It varied little from the shows ending. After investing the time to see this movie, I hated the ending. However, Jacqueline Bisset is still very lovely. Adam Garcia didn't too badly and I did like the sounndtrack so there were a few saving graces...!"
2,not fascinating,"Even though women viewers may love the bedroom scene because Adam Garcia is naked. . . (One reviewer already stated his butt alone is worth the price of the DVD.)Even though men viewers may love the pool scene because Alice Evans strips off her wet panties. . .This movie does not work. It doesn't work with either of its supplied endings. It doesn't work because soon after viewing other parts of the story start crumbling. It is a shame--there are creepy, interesting parts. With more nudity, it would have made great pornography; with more story, it would have been a classic."
1,Awful,"I'm an Adam Garcia fan but even he couldn't save this awful movie! The plot line is laughable. The acting (even Adam, sorry mate!) is pitiful. Save your money on this one. There was no chemistry between any of the actors particularly Adam and his love interest. Not good at all! My DVD is in the trash."
3,The Good Guys,"Excellent book but deceptively advertised inasmuch as I thought the purchase was of a hard bound book, not the paperback version. Paperback was in medium to medium/low condition. Content of book is excellent (I know the author and was interviwed in 1985 for one of the chapters concerning my role in assisting in the eradication of a traditional La Cosa Nostra (American MAFIA) crime family."
4,Out of print ... an overlooked great album,"I used to have this album on vinyl ... and I wish I still did, because it is very hard to locate on CD unless you want to fork out a fortune for it. This CD is out of print across the world. This is Eric Carmen's 1984 album featuring the great single ""I Wanna Hear It From Your Lips"". This is a true feel-good song, but it never appears on any of his ""Best Of"" albums. IN fact none of the songs from this album do, and that is because it was produced by Geffen records, whereas his compilations are produced by EMI records. Other great songs on this album include ""She Remembered"", ""I'm Through With Love"" and the wonderful ""Way We Used To Be"". I hope this album will get a re-release one day ... it is certainly worth it."
3,Almost A Rasberry!,"The rest of the yahoo's reviews on this page are citing the wrong album! This was Eric's Geffen release that went unnoticed by everyone. In fact, this was the closest Eric ever came to recapturing his glory Power Pop sounds of the Raspberries. Eric still pounds away his M.O.R. today and misses out on the greatest Americna Pop band reunion."
3,Ben Human - The Out Of Towner,"So, for those who assumed that acid jazz died a quiet death in the mid-90s, Ben Human comes to prove them wrong. ""Take Me to Las Vegas"" puts its emphasis on the keyboard line and adds some warm chord stabs and a beat to help carry the jazz, while ""Talk is Cheap"" keeps things wobbly. Oddly enough, ""Angry Computer"" starts off with some ominous drones before the funk kicks in, whereas ""The Werewolf Break"" isn't as hairy as its title may suggest. ""Daddy's Back,"" with its requisite _Seinfeld_ sample, ends up swinging, and ""Caipiranha"" goes into some fast breaks with a juicy stand-up bass line. A nice bit of fun."
5,If Angels Ever Recorded A CD,"Four female voices have never blended together so perfectly and beautifully as do those of the 'Anonymous 4.' Their CD titled, 'Portrait' contains a selection of tracks from seven other previous CD's, kind of a ""Best Of"" you might say.If angels ever came down from heaven to record a CD this is what they would sound like.Harmonious, Celestial, Purifying and Eternal."
5,JONES BRINGS THIS KELTON WESTERN TO LIFE,"Tommy Lee Jones brings the Elmer Kelton western classic to life with THE GOOD OLD BOYS. Like Monte Walsh, the story follows a tried and true cowboy's nostalgic efforts to hold on to the only life he knows. Even being roped down in order to help his brother keep his homestead and an appealing lady friend aren't enough to make Huey Calloway (Jones) settle down.A wonderful movie, THE GOOD OLD BOYS features terrific performances by Jones, Sissy Spacek, Francis McDormand, Sam Shepard, Wilford Brimley and Matt Damon. A cameo performance by Larry Mahan, one of the greatest rodeo cowboys ever, adds some wonderful spice and authenticity,As Jones rides off into the sunset, like Tom Selleck in Monte Walsh, the hope and the dream that cowboys will continue to ride is very artfully expressed.Where in the heck is the DVD for this one?THE HORSEMAN"
4,"Tommy Lee Had Me at ""Cow-ology""","Who could resist a movie that opens with a salty old cowpoke complaining to his horse, ""Biscuit"", that he's weary of ""cow-ology""? That short monologue sets the tone for a film that is much like its main character: simple and appealing. Having grown up in West Texas, I can recall characters exactly like those portrayed by Tommy Lee Jones and Sam Shepherd. It's apparent that GOOD OLD BOYS was directed (by Jones) with genuine affection for the material. Jones, along with Sam Shepherd and Sissy Spacek are wonderful. But the supporting players are just as great, including a youngster by the name of Matt Damon.If anyone at TNT reads this, please release a DVD version of GOOD OLD BOYS and include a commentary by its director, Mr.Jones and his fine cast."
5,The Good Old Boys,"I actually bought this for my husband to read, but found I enjoyed it almost as much as he did. He (my husband) is a great fan of good westerns, and liked this book so well, he had me order the vhs tape of the same name."
3,A decent manual for training.,"We used this book alongside two other sources. We chose this book because it was well laid out and easy to follow without too many unnecessary details or information. The illustrations were particularly interesting and fun. Although we liked the techniques used for training, we did not relate to all the commands. Many commands useful for showing, which we had no intention of doing. Our suggestion would be to use this book with one or two others."
5,ford,A fascinating insight into the family most famous in automation and wonderfully incisive writing by Lacey.Books like this are not written any more. It is a book to take your time with and digest slowly like a good roast beef or a goood scotch and is not just a car book. In wrapping up there are two model t Fords in the Farm vehicle museum at WYALKATCHEM WA an eastern wheatbelt town 220 km from Perth. These are well worth a look and there are other very interesting vehicles there also.Cheers
2,"Good idea, badly executed","The idea for the story sounded great and I watched the movie with great expectations. It's very disappointing. The movie has a BBC TV detective series feel to it, with flat lighting, clumsy shots and antique props. While the Germans in the movie are speaking German, the French surprisingly all speak English with a British accent- and I am afraid also behave like it. While it might be better to settle on English rather than using fake French accents, the script does not give the star cast anything to work with. The characters are one dimensional: Michael Caine's war time criminal either pants, sobs or shoots someone, Tilda Swinton's judge chain smokes and barks at everyone. The movie is lengthy and does not build up any suspense. Plus the story does not convince why the police should finance the war criminal Brossard for 40 years rather than forget about him. I will."
2,Seen it all before,"This looked like a perfect film for me but it was dissapointing. Its premise is interesting (revenge for World War 2 crimes, political intrigue) but it has been done so many times before (Marathon Man, Defense of the Realm) that there are not many surprises left. The main character (Caine) has a compelling story but his motive is never explained and so his personal conflict is not resolved. It has a good cast but most of the acting feels like it was phoned in. If you like Michael Caine check out The Quiet American, a simpler but much more powerful movie."
3,Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe,"The book moved at a very slow pace. I found it not to be as good as the movie, which was why I got it in the first place. Generally, the book is always better than the movie."
5,amazing style,"It's definately something different style-wise (which is good), and wonderful when you're looking for a book with developed and loveable characters."
4,Should be read at least twice.,"It's too hard to follow the first time, even IF you've seen the movie, IMHO. And this makes it too hard to appreciate.That's why I only give this four stars. I like my books to be a little more organized than this. But in every other way, the book is wonderful. I love the characters, I love the way it touches on a number of contemporary issues without preaching, and the individual sections are well written."
3,borrow this audiobook from your library,"Use the money you would spend on buying this audiobook to buy the movie -- when they say ""abridged"", they mean it. This audiobook contains only two cassettes, and while the reading is EXCELLENT, you don't get much more of the book than you get in the movie. So buy the DVD -- you'll get behind the scenes stuff and recipes too. And of course, if you haven't already, get the book. But borrow this audiobook from your library first, to see if you really want to pay for it. Wish Ms. Flagg would do an unabridged version -- I'd pay good money for that!"
4,Fun Reading,"Our book club suggested reading Fried Green Tomatoes. I read it years ago, saw the movie and thought I don't want to reread this. Wrong thought. The book was great. It is one of those I can read it all in one day. It jumped back from the present to the past. You felt like you were actually there.It brought up allot of things about the old south with the clan, people's opinions of black people and what allot of people thought about blacks.....as who cares what color they are, they are people just like you and me. It was a good representation of what the TRUE south was really like.Enjoyed reading the book. Everyone in the book club will be coming to the house on Tuesday where we will not only discuss the book but enjoy the delicious recipes that are in the back. We will then watch the movie and discuss the differences between the book and the movie. Sounds like a fun day,"
4,Thought I wouldn't like it,"I got this book form my English teacher. She chose it for me for a reading assignment. I saw it was very thick and I didn't want to read it. When I began to read this book I liked it more and more. The more I read it the less and less I wanted to put it down. As I read this book I wanted to find out more and I never wanted to put it down. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes fiction. I liked it because it had suspense and it kept going back and forth and the more I would read I would find surprises in the book I didn't think I would ever find out. But I read and there it was, an answer to a question I had during the middle of the book, I found in the end. I liked it and I think you will too.Much Luv, Sterling"
4,I quite liked it!,"Whenever I see a movie that was originally a book, I always want to read the book. Then i got on amazon and saw how many people were just lovin the book! So i got. And here I am, to make my own rave review.Although the book jumps around alot, somehow I never got confused or annoyed. It just still fit seamlessly together, ninny telling her story and the rest being filled in. And then it tells the story of Evelyn, who's struggling with depression and her want to die. And then it goes through with her as she suddenly becomes angry, calling herself Towanda.I'd say that it's definately worth the money."
5,one of the best books ever written,I couldnt put this book down. It takes you to a simpler time and you feel as if you are there with the characters.
2,Ugh!,"Dr.Seuss books are more believable than this book. Her overly comical approach is entertaining and humorous, but does not add to the deeper meaning of the book, which is, I believe, real and genuine friendship. Comedy is an important element, but too much of a good thing really takes away from the value."
2,Comedy????,"Well, I hate to be negative, but I do not like this book. True, there is comedy, if you have a lame sense of humour. There are touching moments. Actually, I don't know that for sure, somebody told me that. I never became attached to the characters, and after a while, they just became plain annoying. I wish I had never bought the book."
3,Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistlestop Cafe,"The paper used in the book was not the best quality, but it was adequate. The book was clean."
4,Much better than Daisy Fay,I had read Daisy Fay and the Miracle man and I must say it was not my favorite book. But I loved fried green tomatoes filled with the sweetness of the south and even features the recipes from the book. This book fills you with compassion for the less fortunate and a hatred for racist and sexists alike. You come to love all thew inhabtants of whistle stop and will laugh and cry right along with them. So will Evelyn Couch who is having the story of this town told to her by Ninny Threadgoode and will never be the same agian.
2,boring,I was completely bored with this book. I am reading Can't Wait to get to Heaven and I don't want to put the book down. I really like Fannie Flagg's books but just couldn't get into Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe. If I could return it I would. Sorry
5,Refreshing Read,"This book was a very refreshing read. The characters are so easy to relate to. Her take on menopausal ""Tawanda"" is right on!It's definately a book that will stand the test of time!"
5,"Fried Green Tomatoes, Whistle Stop Cafe.","Loved it, loved the recipes at the end. I read the book quickly, it was very different from the movie, I thought that the book was much better and wished that the movie would have followed the book a little closer, it made much more sense, and described the parts of the movie that really didn't flow well."
4,Enjoyable read,"I had purchased this book for my father to read, but decided to read it first, and thouroughly enjoyed it. I have seen the movie many times, but as usual found the book to be more enjoyable. The story flowed nicely and I really liked the little news chapters by Dot Weems. I would definetly recommend this book."
5,Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe,I love the movie version. Watch it about once a year. The book fleshes out the beloved characters very well. The book is a keepsake to be re-read often.
4,Fried Green Tomatores at the Whistlestop Cafe,This is a wonderful story about the south. Fannie Flagg is a great storyteller.
4,Un-'Flagg'-ingly delightful,"'Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe' is the charming story of two women in 1986, one of whom, old and oracular, soothes the angst of the other, middle-aged and depressed, by telling her wonderful stories of her youth in a railway podunk. I'm sure you know all that already. I heartily recommend this novel: it's witty yet meaningful, the characters are sympathetic and easy to get attached to, and the writing is spot-on. There are quite a few typos and errors in my text; perhaps they've been rectified in further editions. Let these not distract, however, from the fact that FGTATWSC is perfect for a swift and entertaining, yet meaningful read. Fannie Flagg, I salute you!"
4,Awesome read!,"I had never heard of this book before and simply picked it up on an impulse. Boy, was I lucky! Fannie Flagg is an amazing author. I sunk into the world of the book everytime I picked it up and by the time I was done, Idgie, Sipsey, Ninny and the other characters had become a part of my life!I would have given it five stars but for the totally predictable and cinematic ending. Nevertheless, it was feel-good - so am not complaining too much. Overall, if you would like to transport yourself to another age and place right from the comfort of your arm-chair, Fried Green Tomatoes would be a very good choice indeed!"
3,Fannie Flagg FRIED GREEN TOMATOES,"I thoroughly enjoyed Ms Flagg's novel - Fried Green Tomatoes At The Whistle Stop Cafe: A Novel. It was entertaining as a summer read. However, it is a 'period piece' and not reflective of the modern South today. Readers, particularly, the young ones should bear this in mind."
2,disappointed,"I watched the movie several years ago and liked it so I thought I would try the book. I like certain aspects but was disappointed in some of the language, mostly the cursing, I don't see the point of putting that in to ruin a good book. I also don't remember Idgie and Ruth's relationship being homosexual. In the movie I got the impression they were just really good friends, more like sisters. I wouldn't think their relationship would have gone over so easily, as the book portrayed, in those times. I also thought there were too many characters and the timeline jumped around a lot, it was hard to keep up with. I did like Mrs. Threadgoode and Evelyn's story, again minus the horrible cussing ""scene"" at the grocery store. I was quite shocked that language was in there. I am over halfway through and probably will stop reading it because of that."
1,Language very bad,"This was purchased for my 96 year old Mom. She was appalled at the terrible language she heard in Fried Green Tomatoes. Being legally blind, this is the only entertainment she has now, so she was completely taken back by what she heard. She has other Fanny Flagg audio books, but this one she will not listen to. If I could get her a refund, I would!"
4,Makes me want to meet all the characters in person,"In this light-hearted novel, we join Ninny Thredgoode as she reminances her past at the Whistle Stop. There, we join the unforgettable characters in their pranks, their heroism, their ordeals, and of course their joys and sadness. We are taught one simple lesson through the author's unique way of storytelling - to be contented and embrace whatever life has to offer. After finishing the book, I find myself thinking of Ruth, Idgie, Big George and crowd and wish that i could have known them."
2,Don't waste your money,"I am a big Jeff Speakman fan but I have to say that this is probably the worst movie that he has made so far. The best part of the whole movie is the first five minutes where you get to see him perform his Kenpo techniques as a silloette. The story isn't that bad but the direction stinks. Especially for the fight scenes. Things go by so fast that you can't really see what Jeff is doing to the bad guys. Plus alot of shots get obscured by objects in the rooms. And just as a final comment, if you watch this movie watch as a stunt man jumps backwards through a window before Jeff can fully extend his kick."
2,Action Flick with Some Kenpo in It,"Action flick with some halfway decent MA scenes in it; Speakman was still buff in this one, but I found myself fast forwarding to the fight scenes at times. Also stars Ron Silver, who is pretty good as a bad guy."
4,Still Current and Relevant for Forensic Psychology,"This edited volume continues to be a classic in the field of assessing and testifying in court on the subject of post-traumatic stress disorder. As an expert witness in these types of litigation for both the prosecution and defense, I find the rigor of the assessment chapter by Dr. Terence Keane as well as the overarching strategic review chapter by Dr. Robert Simon himself, to be consistently relevant to my practice. Don't be deterred by the book's diagnostic datedness (DSM-IIIR versus DSM-IV)--it's a ""must-have"" for everyone interested in fair and ethical litigation related to psychological trauma."
5,Works well,"I received one of these as a gift. I carry it on my key chain which I attach to my mountain bike when riding. We used this one day when my son had a flat miles from home. I didn't have any trouble getting it to seal agains the valve stem as others have complained. It was easy to use, and from what I understand it actually is piezoelectric so doesn't have a battery contrary to what the Amazon commentary says (I haven't taken it apart so I'm not sure about this). I checked it against my $40 tire pressure gauge on my compressor and it matched exactly for accuracy. For the price how can you go wrong!"
4,New Gadget for the household,I purchased this for my husband for Christmas as a stocking stuffer. He has had some electronic tire gauge's before but this one actually works on our SUV.
3,Usefulll 'lil thang,"I like having a tire gauge and I like having one that fits on a key chain but it is small and delicate for getting a good reading quickly. The end must be matched up flush to avoid air escaping and I am left wondering if an ""O"" ring or other gasket is missing from the unit... other traditional gauges I've used suffer similar problems... hard to read at night or with even modest vision impairments."
3,Compact and Works....most of the time,"Good price and very small, but hard to get a reading sometimes. One must hold the gauge on the tire for quite a while. Nothing spectacular or horrible about this product.."
3,"Good For A Basic Tire Gauge. Expect ""L"" For Bad Battery - Some Point.","I did have this gauge for probably nearly 2 years before I got the dreaded ""L"" on it's display. This means it is probably a low, dead or malfunctioning lithium battery. Then you'll need to send it in for a ""free"" warranty repair. That is, if you can find Accutire's correct warranty address. The back of the gauge's packing had an address I had mailed it to and it was returned to me. i.e. 80 Little Falls Rd., Fairfield, NJ is an INCORRECT address OR at least my package was returned to me anyway. Check it out carefully. Heck... At what they sell for, it'd probably just be better to toss it and buy a new one for all the troubles & hassles."
2,Didn't Work for Me,"I have been unable to get the cable to work with my HP Laserjet 5L printer connected to a new Toshiba laptop running Windows 7. Directions were provided, but don't account for differences in various operating systems."
5,Great read!,"I have read this book with my second and third graders for years. We have laughed over the cat-a-log cats and the trials of Julian with his younger brother and friend, Gloria. They are such good stories, we don't want them to end. When my kindergartener grandson read the caveman tooth story, he belly laughed. The complex surprising vocabulary is pure joy! I'd love to see Ann Cameron write more stories."
2,Shorter than advertized,"Please be aware that this bench is not 3 feet long. It measures only 2' 5 1/2"" long--that's over half a foot shorter than the advertized 3 feet. Other than that, it's a well designed and solid piece of outdoor furniture."
3,Dated material,"I was looking for a book on self publishing and I knew which one I wanted but I grabbed this one by mistake. It has some interesting information about the publishing industry and some good advice about editing.But some of the things he said about the publishing industry just seemed wrong. He was also talking about B. Dalton and Crown books as if they were the largest book sellers in the indsutry. No mention of Amazon or B&N;? Something seemed wrong. Checking the copyright page I found that this book was published in 1985.The industry has definately changed over the past 20 years. The Internet, Word Processing software, and other technology advances since the early 80's have changed the way books are written and published. It is time for an update to this book."
4,Dated but good Info,"This book is not recent, therefore some of the information does not ring true anymore. However, it does provide a lot of good information. I checked it out from the library, but it wouldn't be a bad book to own. There is not mention of anything about the internet as it was published in the 80's. It is mainly geared toward nonfiction writing. Though the information would be good for anyone planning to self-publish. Another book I would recommend if you're really into self-publishing, is Dan Poynter's Self-Publihing manual."
4,really makes you think,Konstantinos seems to know a lot about the subject. Maybe too much (chapter 10). This book lays to rest some of the myths created over time and by movies. Konstantinos covers everyting from beliefs to the different types of vampires. The most interesting part of this book may be the stories presented. They keep you on the edge of your seet. You won't want to put the book down. The only negative is the constant referals to other chapters.
2,Kids stuff..,"This book is just for new fans of vampires. The information that konstantinos brings here is just hours of browsing in the web. Every single topic is on the web. He just going to save you hours of web searching,but the information is for begginers. I doubt of the knowledge of magic of Konstantinos.I gave the book 2 stars, just for the trouble of collect all the web pages and make a book with them."
2,Boooring,"I read this book and several times found myself falling asleep to the blah blah blah meanderings of this author. The information there is good if he would try and condense it into something tolerable to read. The stories are good but found elsewhere, the letters were intriguing but the way he writes just doesn't keep me wanting to read more. I had to force myself to finish this book as it was picked as a book for school to review, otherwise I wouldn't have completed it without a second thought as to what the ending chapters had to ramble about."
3,Intriguing,"I have been reading about vampires for about 5 years now, on and off. I, myself am a strong believer in vampires living among us. I did find a few things that I was unfamiliar with inside this book. Whether you do believe or just read for the thrill, I reccommend this Konstantinos. Well Done, Kon."
3,Lots of lore info,I must admit that I was disappointed somewhat in this book. I suppose from the way everyone was talking about it I thought it would be on more of the vampire sub culture of today and not necessarily the past tales of vampiric accounts. However I did enjoy reading about what the vampire is considered to be across the world as well as read the tales of what others have seen or heard
1,Sensational - unfortunately,"As people grow more accustomed to the presence of vampires, the last thing we need is alarmism. Yes, there are vampires - but those who don't have willing donors seldom take more from any individual than they can afford (or even notice). There are also passive-aggressive individuals; and while the monicker doesn't sell books half as well as does the trendy ""vampire,"" those who wish not to be preyed upon might do well to learn the difference.There are plenty of people and things out there that should be considered dangerous, but vampires aren't one of them. This book encourages irrational fear and a divisive attitude, which only makes it a pity that it's so well and convincingly written."
1,Too much wind resistance,"Don't recommend these pants if you are trying to overcome wave drag or supersonic flow. My wife received a pair of these for her birthday and her movement has never quite been the same. It takes her at least 8 times longer to go from the spice cabinet to the microwave and 5 times longer to walk from the mailbox to the lawn gnome at our front door. On windy days, I don't even let Helen out of the house even to pick up the newspaper. Before purchasing these 'Stretch Gaucho Pants', I recommend using the drag equation to calculate the force experienced by an object moving through a fluid at relatively large velocity (i.e. high Reynolds number, Re > ~1000), also called quadratic drag...THEN make your decision..."
5,Beautiful!,"I read to my daughter every night before bed-- twice: the first time she can see the pictures, the second time she has to close her eyes and ""see the story in her imagination."" Last night, I couldn't get her to keep her eyes closed the second time-- she just wanted to look at the beautiful pictures! When the story was over, she initiated a game of ""which is your favorite star"" in the endpapers!Just a sweet story with beautiful illustrations. We'll be looking for more by Moss and Fehlau!"
5,One of the best nighttime books,My 16month old son loves the moon and stars and loves this song and I was so happy that he just loves this book. He is resisting bedtime but will cooperate as soon as he sees that we are going to read/sing this book. I think it is a must have for any child who likes Sesame Street - it is just fabulous and gives my son such joy.
4,Great Way to Learn the Song,"I Don't Want to Live on the Moon has been one of my son's favorite songs since birth. We got the book a couple of months before he turned 2 (along with Imagination) and they became his instant favorites. In fact we read/sang the book with him so many times within no time he was singing along and then he started singing the full song by himself. He would bring both books to us and say ""I read On the Moon, you read Imagination"" then switch when we finished reading one of the books.Only complaint, we read it so much I wish it was a board book!!!"
5,Quintessential Mariah,"I have had to fight my teen daughters to get this CD back, love the songs and that Mariah is in full force."
4,GREAT ALBUM,"Mariah seems to be following the latest trend on the music industry:when your album is selling like hotcakes,capitalise on the success by rereleasing the album with additional material.After all it did wonders for Usher's ""Confessions"" record sales.The new songs on the album are good,especially ""Don't Forget about Us"",which basically has the same message as ""We Belong Together"".The remix of ""We Belong Together"" falls flat though,not even Jadakiss can revive it.""So Lonely"" is another great song.The DVD which contains her music videos is another treat.I guess this album did it's task,judging by the fact that it pushed the album's sales from five million to six million."
3,great cd but DUMB dvd access program!,"i can't even install this damn software:DVDacess, to access mariah's interview!! can't they made this DVD easier? like gorillaz DVD is so easy to access!! no software needed to be installed. wasted 1.5 hr of my life to figure out a way! damn it!! bloody stupid software engineers created this crap!"
2,nice music...in broken case,This arrived in broken case from vendor....I bought it from goodwil and was surprised the way it was packaged.Lets say money spent for good cause but I need to find a new case for the CD
1,Oh Mariah..... Please...,"This poor gal is washed up and worn out. What happened to the days of ""Music Box"" or ""Day Dream"" where she was a vocal diva? Very few could sing like her. Now, we're forced to hear this monotonous, cookie-cutter crap that any moron with a microphone could put out. Can she still sing like she used to? Or, has she lost her voice like Whitney (there's another sad story). Note to Mariah: drop the hoochie-wanna-be hacked hip-hop horse crap and remember the music that put you where you are. What a waste of talent (if she still has it)."
3,Okay album,"This album has some good tracks. I am just tired of the guest rappers. Heck, I am tired of rap period. And can we stop the Mariah vs Madonna fight! They are both powerful women and both are great at what they do."
1,lol bad cd,carey is a good singer but this cd was horrible this cd was not that good i really im dispointed at carey for making this cd she should not have made this cd this was a bad idea to make this cd
1,Mariah HAS NOT had more #1s than Madonna!,"OK, I understand. Mariah has had 16 #1s in the US - Madonna has had 12, yadda, yadda, yadda...Mariah has had two UK #1s and Madonna has had 11. That's just two countries. See, it's proof Madonna is the Ultimate Pop Queen and that worldwide, people enjoy Madonna's music more.This release is also a cash-in."
3,not Mariah's fault--but the record company does fans an injustice,"I'm simply rating this for the quality of the re-release, not the album itself.Naturally, fans of Mariah are going to be willing to plop down more money for an expanded edition. But as with many recent scams of this sort by record companies, it STILL could have been more complete. Where are ""Sprung"" and ""Secret Love"", the two amazing tracks from the MEGA-expensive Japanese import of Emancipation? And why not include ""U Make Me Wanna"", Mariah's duet with Jadakiss from his CD, so that this would have been TOTALLY worth the price of a second purchase??? That would have been the ULTIMATE Emancipation of Mimi CD."
5,This is a great CD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I am not a fan of Mariah, but when I heard the the first single from this cd, I thought let's go get this. I bought it, got it home and listen. This to me is her very best cd ever!!!! I mean Mariah would release a single that I liked, but nothing that would get me to purchase a cd. This is totaly different. I'm saying the lyrics,the music, and the collaborations, everything about this cd says good work. This is just a all round great cd. This is comming from someone who is not a fan of Mariah Carey. That is saying a lot!!!!"
5,For my wife,I bought this CD for my wife who really liked this Cd but the one she had was wrecked. I ordered this one & she was very happy to have it. She has had no complaints (which I would have heard right away). This Cd shipped on time & in good condition.
4,Fondue pot,I really like this pot. Great for cheese dip without scorching it. I do wish it had some kind of lid because we entertain outdoors.
4,good,very large good hotpot fondue. Only problem is that there really is no warming function. It either is really hot or nothing.
4,Rival Fondue Set,The Rival FD350S electric unit heats quickly and is easy to clean. The power cord is somewhat unusual and requires attention prior to use.
4,fondue fever,We love the fondue pot. Love the sharp chrome look. The only drawback is that the inside is harder to clean without teflon. Leftover cheese or chocolate just slid off the teflon in our old Rival Fondue pot.It's probably healthier for us without the teflon.
3,Rival fondue,"An OK product. The pot is very large but Rival seems to have put safety over function. For example, Rival says you should not use an extension cord but the existing cord is way too short (about 3 ft). Also the magnetic connection for the electric cord is too easy to accidently brush and disconnect and the restriction to only use a maximum of 8 fondue forks in the pot at a time in this huge fondue pot seems unnecessary given the huge size of the fondue pot."
4,Works nicely.,"If you are used to the sterno kind of Fondue set, this will take a little getting used to. Keep in mind it can get very hot. Monitor it well until you are familiar with the settings and you will come to love this. So much easier than sterno."
5,Electric fondue with predictable heat,"I bought this so I could prepare fondue for my wife for her birthday. It's a great product. The magnetic break-away cord is a necessary nuisance for safety. I just run an extension cord up onto the table. The heat selection dial is predictable. It was easy to set the dial to cook with the hot oil without scalding everything. Some recipes suggest cooking on the stove and transferring to the fondue pot before serving, but with this product you can cook in the fondue pot. I can't imagine what could possibly use the maximum heat setting! Turning the dial down reduced the heat predictably. Cleanup is easy, as the cords are removable and the entire dish and legs are submersible. Plus, the dish is stainless, so just allow it to cool and everything cleans up nicely."
4,Great pot,"I love this thing. i use it for cheese, chocolate and shabu...after looking at others, i wish I got a nonstick, but i've really had no issues with this! it's huge for 6 people though!"
3,pretty good,"I've used it a couple of times for chocolate, and once with cheese. Chocolate worked great because I melted the chocolate in a double boiler and then poured it into the fondue pot to keep warm. When I did cheese, I made the fondue right in the pot, which wasn't such a good idea. The heating element, like most, is either on or off. This means that it gets things very hot, then the thermostat turns off the element and gets it very cold, before it cycles on again. This makes it impossible to keep things at a simmer while you try melting your cheese. When the heating element is on, there is a ring of boiling cheese right over the heating element, meaning that there needs to be much stirring. Next time I do cheese fondue, I'm going to make it elsewhere (on my stovetop) and then transfer it to the pot to keep warm while I enjoy it."
5,FUN-due!!! :o),"Fondue is the single best way to get your children to try different vegetables. Who am I kidding? It's the best way to get everyone to eat more veggies, as the various sauces are delicious and easy to prepare with this Fondue Pot. I love the fact that it's electric and has the magnetic break-away cord. The *only* problem I have with it is that the cord is a bit too short. I have to use an extension cord in order for my family to enjoy it at the dinner table. But that's a small, fixable problem, so I still give it 5 stars. :o) We use it 2-3 times a week, and I wouldn't hesitate to buy it for someone as a gift."
4,Great price great service!!!!,Bought this product for a gift for a friend and the service was great. Thanks
1,Be sure to buy some tape!,"I think this product is terrible! The ""breakaway"" magnet feature on the heater is poorly designed. The heating unit kept pulling apart and finally my husband had to tape it together so we could actually use the thing.I think the design is terrible!"
1,fondue set,"This item is a piece of junk, its greatest drawback is that it is not teflon lined and the cheesesticks to it like glue, it is also too large for the average user as well as for the size of the packages offondue that you can get in a gourmet store. I even managed to break off a piece of plastic on thecontrols trying to get it to click together, it turned out to be a magnet, not a good idea.Tiger Cheese Fondue - Classic Swiss Recipe"
1,Wrong electrical wire attachment,"Not only was I sent the wrong electrical wire attachment for this appliance, but it was a used one."
1,Feel misled by price,"Have to say I love Amazon and am very impressed with their service.On this item, however, I only gave one star, but I have not used one of these. My comment is about price.We bought this as a Christmas present for a newly engaged couple. It had said it was originally $49.99, and I think I paid $29.99. It is now $34+. Still shows original price of $49.99.Imagine my disappointment this morning when I found I could have gone up the street and bought this from Bi Mart, a local store for $29.99 REGULAR PRICE, and now is on sale for $24.99. I thought we must have bought a better model so I checked the model no. No, exactly the same mode.I always thought Amazon had competitive and I am a regular shopper on Amazon. I guess I should be checking Amazon prices with my local stores more."
1,Incorrectly packaged,"When I received this item it was packaged with the wrong power cord, which didn't fit the unit. So I wasn't even able to use this unit."
3,NICE ELECTRIC FONDUE,"IT HEATS UP VERY FAST,BE CAREFUL AND KEEP STIRRING,I SUPRISED,I ALMOST BURNED THE CHOCOLATE.GOOD DESIGN,I LIKE THE BREAK AWAY CONNECTION,PREVENTS ACCIDENTS.THE PIECE THAT HOLDS THE FONDUE FORKS,DOES NOT STAY ON THE POT VERY WELL.FOR THE PRICE I PAID I DON'T KNOW IF I WOULD BUY IT AGAIN,OR GO WITH A SIMPLE DESIGN."
5,Jeopardy 2 review,"This game was purchased for my 17 yr old son, who loves the show, and he is very happy with this game. It keeps him entertained for hours at a time."
2,Eclecticus,"Jeopardy II is easy enough to play, unfortunately it is a ""bare bones"" game. When you question an answer correctly you are told so; but when you are incorrect you are not told what the correct question is. this is a major shortcomming. Especially if one likes to play Jeopardy asn both a fun game and a learning experience."
2,Not very fun.,I was expecting more from this game. It was not very fun and was really just a novelty item. The graphics appear to be from the 1980s and the method of responding is old too. It is not compatible with newer Macs and I found that it crashed my PC several times. I don't even remember where I've placed this game nor do I care. I would not buy this again.
1,what a gyp!,This product was a waste of money and time. It messed up my computer. I am sure it was only this copy. I love the game but this copy was garbage. I will never buy from this person again.
5,The Brown Derby Restaurant: A Hollywood Legend,"Anyone who is interested in old Hollywood must read this book.It is not only filled with pictures andrecipes, but nostalgia and history ofbygone days.Robert Cobb, not only owned the BrownDerby, but also owned a baseball team.The Hollywood Stars of the Pacific Coast League was in existence from 1939to 1957. The Los Angeles Dodgers cameWest in 1958 and the Stars were gone.The book was co-written by Sally Cobb,widow of the owner. Her personal thoughts and love are written throughout this book. I personally ama collector of old menu's and a historian regarding the Pacific CoastLeague. I certainly was fascinated andwrapped up in the book."
5,A nostalgic review of Hollywood's Golden Era at The Derby,"An excellent and most interesting history of The Brown Derby written by the founder's widow (Sally Cobb) and Mark Willems.A wonderful photographic essay of many of The Brown Derby's clientele during the Golden Age of Hollywood. This book also includes many of the Derby's most famous receipes as well.After ordering a copy for myself, I then ordered several additional copies for friends and family members who knew many of the individuals photographed at the Derby and which are shared with us by Mrs. Cobb and Mr. Willems."
1,Libertarian Party included.,"The Libertarian Party was included in this encyclopedia. I checked it out at a public library. Now, while it qualifies under the Author's contention that extremist parties are 'deviations from the normal' (my paraphrase), it shows the uselessness of such a definition of extremism.The Libertarian Party has never advocated the overthrow of the constitution, any state constitution, or any armed paramilitary activities. At most Libertarians may use their constitutional right to arm themselves, but it is on an individual basis without ANY organization by the party.The inclusion of the Libertarian Party makes the whole work suspect."
1,Wish I could rate the book!,Wish I could rate the book and tell how efficient it was. The seller has not sent it. Why Amazon.com allows him to do business under their name I don't understad. I should have read the reviews but didn't. He has terible reviews. I thought since he is selling in Amazon.com he would be a serious business person. I even thought that Amazon.com would be better than Ebay as to who they allow to sells products.
4,I like this for my older kids :),"I bought this set when my girls were smaller (around 3), and they never played with it. It was hard for them to put the pieces together and just became another annoying toy with a thousand pieces. I was disappointed as I loved them as a kid. However, now that the older ones are 6 and 8, they are asking for them. I am sure now they will have lots of fun putting them together and will understand the concept and can clean up the toys themselves also. Just thought another review might help if you have younger children :)"
2,The pieces lose their interlocking capabilities,"We got these for our 3 year old and much to my dismay, the sticks lose their capacity to lock in with the round pieces after one use. Now they can be inserted but they fall right out. I am really disappointed in the quality and value of the toy."
4,Great to foster creativity,"This toy requires a bit more advanced planning than playing with Lego - the parts cannot be used as flexibly. This will require a new level of creativity for the child to create what (s)he has in mind, especially if it's supposed to be functional. My girls ages 4 and 2 like it, but overall still prefer Lego. This is probably better suited for boys that age, although I value that my girls learn to play with construction toys like this also."
3,Bad quality,"It is a beautiful idea, but the quality of this toy is bad. The pieces are not cut well so many times when trying to connect two pieces, either it is hard to impossible to connect, or it is too loose so that it does not hold together. Otherwise, my 4 years old son loves it and creative many interesting sculptures with it.Not sure if I would but again from this brand because of the quality issue."
4,Very flimsily made...,"My son breaks two or three rods every time he plays with it. He has fun with it, but the quality is zero. Toys are too expensive to throw them out like this. We're going to stick with Legos and Lincoln Logs from now on!"
4,Tinker toys like originals,"Purchased two of these tinker toy sets for granddaughters. They are as I remember them, wood with nice mix of pieces. The only down side is the pictures of projects are small and that makes it difficult for a young child to follow, even I had problems. But that aside, product is good, delivery prompt, price was very good with free shipping"
3,Classic Tinkertoy,NO INSTRUCTION SHEETS OR BOOKLET ON PROJECT CONSTRUCTION!Not enough difference in the number of wooden pieces compared to the so-called smaller sets.
1,What happened to Tinkertoy quality?,"I was willing to pay a premium price for this toy based on the Tinkertoy reputation and our prior experience with Tinkertoys over two generations. My recent purchase was very disappointing. The quality of the pieces was inconsistent so that some of the rods and spools fit nicely, and others fit so poorly that the resultant structures fell apart at the slightest touch.Tinkertoys have always provided creative play for our family in the past, but imagine witnessing the frustration of a child who has designed and built a Tinkertoy ""project"" only to have it fall apart. I was embarassed that my gift was so poorly manufactured. I tried to contact Hasbro regarding this issue, but was not accorded the courtesy of an answer."
3,Too Frustrating!,"I remember LOVING Tinkertoys as a child. My sister and I shared a set and it lasted years and years. My 4 year old son got a package as a gift (I recommended it to the gift-giver) a few months ago and it is on its last legs already. Several of the stick pieces have cracked and had pieces come off at the end where the notch is. Also, many of the sticks do not fit into the holes in the wheels very well. The holes are too big and the sticks fall out. I get extremely frustrated when trying to build one of the models shown on the box or paperwork for my son. Often, it CANNOT be done because of pieces breaking and sticks not fitting in wheels. I have put the toy in the basement. I am now deciding if I should give it away or just throw it out! This toy would be a lot more fun if it were more durable and made properly."
5,Classice Tinkertoy Set,Just as good as the one I remembered as a child. My 5 year old son loves to play with this toy and really jump starts his creativity.
3,"An old classic, with some small issues.","My daughter wanted Tinkertoys for Christmas very badly. I was excited, as they were one of my favorite toys as a child. They came in the old cardboard can with the tin tops. We've had fun playing with it, and it did come with as many pieces as it was supposed to, but not enough blue pieces to build any of the items shown on the can or in the instructions."
4,Better than I expected!,"I read many of the reviews for this toy before I purchased it for my 3.5 year old this Christmas. I was pleasantly surprised - none of the pieces have broken and everything seems very durable (unlike some of the reviews I read about). My husband and I have both played with it and we haven't had any problems with it!! My son enjoys building ""planes and spaceships"" and it's been a great gift so far."
4,tinker toy,"I bought this one and the 250 piece sets for my son. I would get the 250 piece set over this one as you can build much better stuff with more pieces. However, I am glad i bought both because it can keep both of my children happy and there is plenty for mom too!"
4,Tinker toys are still great fun,My grandchildren love these Tinkertoys. They are great Lego fans so I was not sure they'd be interested. Their ages are 5 - 10 and they all really enjoy them and are always thrilled to show off their creations.
3,"Seller phone contact, reimbursement was given.",I orginial was disappointed in the curtain and wrote a review stating my disappointment. Then the seller contacted me by phone while I was at work. Not Cool. I stated that after looking at the curtain(shells are still falling off)and hanging I would keep but not to call me. Called anyway. Not Cool. Asked me to change my review and I could keep product and would issue refund. That was nice and I agreed. No refund as of yet!!! The calling was unneccessary for Amazon has rules in place so personal contact avoided unless requested. Very upset with Seller and Amazon. Have not purchased any items since.I was mistaken and the seller did reimburse the full amount. Was contacted by my bank today. However the seller did call.
3,Flashback to preBeatles British rock,"This will send shivers of nostalgia through the fifty-somethings who remember when Cliff and the Shadows were THE British act. The sound here is rough and energetic but catches the atmosphere of those small-venue concerts. The spoken remarks by the lads are engaging but the screaming fans can get a little annoying. The instrumental tracks by the Shadows are more enjoyable than Cliff's vocals. The special packaging, though interesting, is difficult to store. This album really is for those who remember those early days in the sixties . . . and I do!"
2,Not enough independence,"I think that this book was not the best that I have read. I don't like how Kat let Reed tell her that she was his and only his while he was letting his ex-flame hang all over him and expected his wife to not over react. I think Kat needed to be a little more independent and not take that kind of stuff. She should have left when he took Rosita to the fiesta and left her home. She should have just went to her aunts and got a divorce. I think this book could have been better. I hate seeing how the woman are to obey and deal with whatever there husbands do, they need to make these woman stronger..and stand up for themselves."
1,I hated it!,"I can not believe how many people liked this book! Kathleen who is supposed to be strong, well educated 17 yr old is beaten not once but 3 different times by the hero Reed and in the end with a black eye and bruises they sail off into the sunset! Why would anyone think that was ok? I have not read any other books by this author and probably will not."
1,Total waste of time,"If you are looking to build a so-called farm house in suburbia, this is for you. If you are looking for ideas to build in a true rural area, and want to design with a sense of historic value, this book is not for you."
2,a simple checklist,"The text is simplistic. It names the names but doesn't go into depth about the pros and cons of various system features. If you're new to the world of WMS and looking to purchase one from a third-party vendor, this pamphlet provides a convenient checklist of features to ask potential vendors about. If you're already familiar with the terrain, don't waste your money. I purchased the book hoping to find a couple of ideas that would help me improve the WMS in my company. It took me an hour to read, during which time I got one new idea I might use, someday. For that reason only, I'm not going to ask for a refund."
5,The best of it's kind!,"I have had so much trouble finding a casual bra/sports bra that did not end up tugging on my shoulders and causing my neck to ache. This bra is perfect. I am a 40 D and this bra supports me completely without any discomfort. The criss-cross design in the front gives support to the chest and takes the pressure off of your shoulders. Also, there is no thick elastic band around the bottom, so there is no uncomfortable constriction. I wear this bra every single day and sleep in it every single night. One minor flaw: you will probably have to cut out the tag on the inside of this bra because it is a bit itchy...easy process though. Lastly, for a casual bra this really compliments the female figure and shows off a little bit of cleavage. ;) ...just in case.A+++"
3,Seams were irritating,"I bought this bra after breast surgery to sleep in. I got the 36-38 DD/F and wear a 36DD in every bra I've purchased since my surgery. This bra was pretty snug and a little difficult to get on. Then once I had it on I discovered the seams along the bust and under my bust were very irritating. I gave it a chance and slept in it all night. It was okay but I didn't really notice a difference from my other sports bras that I sleep in. Hopefully the seams won't bother me as much when I'm healed more and my skin isn't so sensitive. I don't know if it's worth the $46 I paid. But I will give the woman who created this bra some credit, the cut and shape are unique and this is a great concept, as it does seem to offer more side support."
4,Great for sleeping,"I just got this sleep bra, and I think it's great. I'm on the bigger side and role around a lot when I'm sleeping, so my breasts ache after a night's sleep. With the Sleep Top I'm supported all night, and the bra is comfortable enough to sleep in. No huge elastic bands to dig into your torso or shoulders, and no clasps either. It is a bit tighter on the back and the shoulders than I'd like, though. I'd prefer the arm holes to be cut a little wider. Overall, a great product."
2,Very disapointing for such an expensive bra,"I honestly never felt comfortable in the bra. Maybe if I had the right size I wouldn't complain. It didn't fit properly (I'm a 36 C and that's what I purchased) so the cups dippled in the front. Also, it was very uncomfortable to sleep in. My breast didn't 'stay' when I slept on my back and they actually felt constricted like I was wearing a too tight sports bra. The arm holes were too high so it rubbed against my arm pits. I wore it for about 2 hours and have never put it on since. Very disapointing for such an expensive bra."
2,Heating element is NOT consistent,Product looks good BUT the heating element is faulty. When it reached its temperature it shuts off. Throughout the party we would have to turn it off then turn it back on too keep the food barely warm. Considering on returning it. We are going to try it again tonight and will make a decision. Basically we would not recommend this product or brand.
5,Great value,Great value and really like that it can be used as a heating tray or use the containers. The plastic lids are very serviceable but the first unit arrived with a chipped lid. I received a replacement unit extremely quickly and it works very well.
1,Low quality,"Very disappointing quality, cheap materials, do not recommend. Please buy GE!When I got it I could not believe how thin the stainless was. Walmart have for similar price much stronger one"
4,warmer,I haven't actually used the warmer yet. I did test it and it appears to be just what I was looking for.
1,Watch out!!!!,"I received this item about 6 months ago, and my fault, did not try it right away....I pulled it out of the cabinet on Sunday for a party and it would not come on...my husband took the back off and the inside insulation was severely burned where the electric connects to the heating element.....pretty sure they will not replace at this late date, but am going to try....even if they do, this is still a definite quality control issue! I am going to purchase another one, but definitely from a more reputable company...."
1,THROW YOUR MONEY OUT YOUR CAR WINDOW,PURCHASED THIS BUFFET WARMER AND IN BROKE IN ONE MONTH. SENT IT BACK TO THE HELMEN GROUP AND THEY NEVER RETURNED MONEY OR UNIT. CHECK OUT COMPLAINTS ON THIS COMPANY BEFORE YOU BUY!
1,Bad,This product is not very good. Over heats and burns table cloth. I would not trecomend it to anyone. buy a more expensive one.
1,It BROKE!,I bought this for my daughter for Thanksgiving. About an hour in to using it.... everything was cold.! Now to try and return it.
2,Not as good as I expected,The individual trays are too small to use for any significant amount of food. The frame is cheap and flimsy. It does heat well though.
3,damaged when it arrived,"This buffet server arrived in a box that was in perfect codition but the server was bent and the warming tray was dented. It did not even sit straight on the counter. Thanks to my handy husband, he was able to straighten it and pound out the dents. It is alot of trouble to pack it all up and send things back. I will go back to shopping at a retail store, that way the risks are fewer!"
1,Pocket PC users: read this befor you buy!,This unit is *NOT COMPATIBLE* with Windows Mobile 5!Don't buy if you own one of the new iPAQ's.
4,Works as advertised,"I am happy with the unit. It worked with my iPAQ 5455 after about 20 mins of configuration. I had a little trouble setting the Bluetooth COM port on my iPAQ, but after that it worked and continues to work great. I also bought a window mount for my iPAQ so that all I have to do now is slip the iPAQ in the car, turn on the GPS RX and start the program. With my common destinations already loaded and my ""avoid"" area's programmed it works very well. I do wish I could program way points though. I am currently looking for a copy of the Western European maps as I'm travelling there soon."
2,A Total Disappointment,"For the life of me, I can't figure out how this dvd garnered any positive reviews! The camera work is bland, scenery shots seem to be at a minimum and it's as boring as can be. The background music is thin and doesn't add anything to the energy of the trail. This is a dull, poorly done production. Save your money and time!"
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I received this DVD as a gift after putting it on my Amazon wish list and man was I disappointed! I thru hiked the trail in 2009 and am always up for a good DVD about the AT. This isn't one of them. If you're expecting to get an insight about trail life, you won't find it here. The production is low budget, amateur, and badly edited. Your money would be better spent on a good AT guidebook or even a couple dehydrated meals than this DVD."
4,Informative and Unique,"I found this DVD useful in part because it gives a good perspective in a couple areas: 1. On how much people overpack and how much gear people do not need. 2. It gives a good idea of the amount of precipitation there is along the A.T. and that if you are dedicated to hiking the A.T. you better be prepared for the rain. In summary, the DVD gives a good introduction to the trail and touches on a few things that are useful."
3,"OK, But Not Great","I love reading books and watching anything I can on the AT. Honestly, 2000 Miles to Maine did not make the top of my list. It really didn't connect with me because I wanted to see more of the trail, but this film was mostly comprised of interviews with hikers. I think that was their goal, so they did a good job of what they were trying to accomplish, but it wasn't what I was hoping for. My advice is to add it to your collection if you really want to, but if you're only getting one DVD on the AT, you might want to consider another. So, its not bad. It just wasn't for me."
2,2000 Miles To Maine,As an avid hiker i was quite interested in watching this DVD. I did enjoy it somewhat and ONLY for its entertainment value.It has no educational value whatsoever. The film had major holes in it and failed miserably regarding scenery. If your interested in the ATs culture then this might interest you. I hate to be so harsh but its pretty much a waste of money.
2,Too Much Missing,"This film was not that bad, but too much of the trail was left out. It started out in GA of course and the next thing you know it is in New England somewhere. I would have liked to have seen more of the trail itself. It would have also been nice to see those behind the camera. The film did do a good job of telling the stories of several hikers themselves. For videos on the AT, I would recommend Trek instead of this one, but if you are a true backpacker you will probably find this one somewhat entertaining."
5,A must have for any AT enthusiast or wannabe AT enthusiast!,"Within 24 hours of receiving my copy of 2000 Miles to Maine I had watched it three times! Morse's hard work and devotion to the project translates into a captivating documentary following several thru hikers on the Appalachian Trail. The characters are entertaining, the footage is excellent and the production work brings it all together. It is a great piece of work!"
3,too much shaky camerawork,"There were many enjoyable moments in this video, but there was so much camera movement that I found myself feeling motion sickness by the end. In any film, small amounts of camera movement are acceptable, and even desirable. But this entire film suffered from a shaky picture. This could have been avoided. The lack of a tripod can be compensated for by steadying the camera against a tree or a shelter or a rolled up sleeping bag on the ground or whatever is handy. I think more attention should have been paid to steady the camera, whether by a tripod or some other method."
2,AT,"Of 4 DVDs I have veiwed about thru hiking the AT, I thought this was the worse one.Gave a real slanted look at the type of people who hike the AT.The other DVDs I have seen about the AT made me want to chuck my job, throw on my rucksack and hit the trail.This DVD made me think ""screw the AT, I am going to hike the PCT. Too many weirdos and too crowded on the AT""."
2,blah,"Well, I was a bit dissapointed with this one. It was entertaining enough that I wanted to watch the whole thing. I am not sure if i watched it to feel better about spending money on it."
4,"great taste, mixes well","I just tried this, and the taste is excellent. It mixed very easily. Shipping was fast! I'm still hungry but using self control, the best thing is, no stomach upset at all! I will come back and rewrite my review after I've tried it for longer."
3,okay,"it has a good taste. It wasn't what I was looking for. Wanted more of an appetite surpressant, but ti was a good taste."
5,One of my Favorite Protein Shake,Tried strawberry ice cream flavor and love the taste and very good product. Used for weight loss and it really helps to make you feel full.
3,"Great product, but beware.","I definitely agree with all the good things that the other reviewers say about this product. I've used MRPs (mostly Met-Rx) for decades and also attest to their benefits. However, I gave it only three stars because I strongly object to the ad's omission of the fact that Labrada Nutrition's Lean Body contains sucralose.Sucralose replaced aspartame---which from its invention at Searle was known to damage brain cells---as the no-calorie sweetner of over whelming choice by food packagers.Regrettably, sucralose is known to kill off our probiotics, the bacteria that enable food's digestion!We all have the right to take our chances. Nevertheless, the vendors of products that they encourage us to eat have the duty to inform of what those chances are."
5,Excellent product,"Excellent product. The chocolate flavor is amazing. If you prepare this protein shake with crushed ice (as one recommendation ) you will ""taste"" a delicious ice cream. I love it!!"
1,Not as expected,I have bought this product in the past but it was in individual packets. It tasted much better compared to this product. I ended up returning it as it was that awful.
3,Tastes Different than it Used To,I've been using Lean Body Shakes for a while now. They've always tasted great but this last shipment tasted chalky and was quite difficult to drink. I'm not sure if they changed the formula or if I got a bad batch but its enough to make me cancel my subscription to my monthly purchase and go another route. I'm very disappointed.
1,Really?,"I wanted to try buying this online because it cost me $40 in the store for 1 tub and now i regret it, it doesn't taste at all like the one i buy at my local vitamin shop. I checked the skus to make sure i didnt mess up and order the wrong one and they matched up with the tub i bought locally and every thing else on the bottle matched up with my old one too. This one is way to chalky and doesn't dissolve all the way either so i guess im going back to spending more on this product at my local vitamin shop"
5,Very filling,"Great for a subsitute meal and great for building lean muscle mass. Taste is great. Mixes well, none of those clumps."
3,Lean Body Shake - Chocolate,"Quite satisfying and good taste but lacks mixability in blender. Many, many times I have to clean powder off of blender container sides and reblend."
5,good purchase,"tastes good, easy to prepare, separate pouches make it easy to carry along with at work."
2,don't like taste at all,"I've have never had a good tasting protein meal replacement shake and this one is no better. I know taste preference is all subjective. But if you don't like the sickening sweet flavor of artificial sweetners and that nasty after taste, then you won't like this. Please note I hate the taste of diet soda too, just to give you a reference point. After forcing myself to drink it once a day for a week, I just couldn't do it anymore. The articial sweetening is too much for me and the thought of having to drink it everyday..well I just can't do it. I will continue making my own meal replacement shakes with plain whey protein with no artificial sweeters. I like to mix in a little fruit( blueberries, raspberries or strawberries) or yogurt or honey to keep carbs low."
5,"Great taste, Great Results","This protein powder was highly recommended from a few of my friends when I started looking for something to help with my work out results. This protein powder taste fantastic, especially when mixed with some frozen fruit and peanut butter, just like an ice cream shake. It fills me up, it can be used as a meal replacement. It also has helped me increased muscle size much faster then previously. This product is great and I recommend it for anyone from an everyday Joe just trying to get into shape to people who are very serious about working out."
3,Works for weight loss!,"I am using this for as a meal replacement for weight loss purposes. I'm definitely seeing results, however I find it to sickeningly sweet (and I have a sweet tooth)! It's like over sweetened cake batter and I can't even stand the smell. However, my husband likes the flavor and is drinking it because he was encouraged by my results! I'm going to try ordering something other than the Vanilla Ice Cream ."
1,Jolity... Customer Service,"We ordered a product thinking we was getting one thing and received another. Upon contacting them (Jolity) after a return they argued with me around their return policy, the credit,and hung up on me. At this time I would recommend to you the consumer not to purchase anything from Jolity based on their customer service and behavior. I would recommend going directly to who they send the order off to have shipped. They (jplizzy) were very nice and understanding."
5,Nice Photos,I think this an insightful book with great photos. It is a must for all 2cv owners along with the Chiltons.
5,"Great Guide to history, customs, what to see !","I love these insight guides; very interesting,& packed full of info and beautiful pictures. Gives the traveler a working knowledge of sites to see, customs, history, politics and the ideology of the people of a given region. It is not meant to be an extensive study of an area, but a useful travel guide, and for that purpose it earns 5 stars easily ! It is not a guide of where to stay or where to eat, but it gives useful information about each area covered so that a traveler knows what a locale has to offer and some background on each area. Great to pack in the suitcase or browse in the armchair !"
4,Another Hip Hop movie.,"This movie is really good it features Marques Houston, Omari from B2K and a lot more. Its about a dance group who are tryin to get famous and rich making a livin in life. But when stuff happens such as betrayel, trust, and stuff like that get in the way this movie get's pretty violent. But other then that there is nothin like classic Breakdancing moves from the street which is a real compitition, this movie gets pretty exciting. With a pretty good storyline and a 5 star worth break dancin show this movie deserves 4 STAR'S."
5,Jennifer,"I thought that the movie was great! B2K and MArques HOuston are sooooo hot! I think it's funny though how all the ads for this movie in magazines and stuff say starring Omarion Grandberry and Marques Houston with Steve Harvey and barely even mention B2K. Anyway though, this was a great movie and I loved everything about it! The guys are so hot and the dancing is great!"
3,Fun movie,My 10 year old daughter loves to dance and this one is her favorite. It is really cool. We have watched it many of times since we got it.
1,"As of 11/11/05, 942 people have rated this film a ""10"" on IMDb.com...","..looks like they got served.The plot: Two friends have to win a dance contest if they want to open their own recording studio.This film is another movie that every 13 year old rap fan seems to salivate over. It averages a rating of 2.1 on IMDB. A 2.1 is disturbingly high for this movie. The movie was just another example of how today's youth's culture is degenerating at a steady pace. It's another movie glorifying ""thugg lyfe."" It was just a plain, flat-out boring movie, or in other words, a flat-out P.O.S. People who say ""Freddy Got Fingered"" is bad should see THIS. After my first viewing of this, I've found that watching paint dry better than this, hell, watching Batman and Robin again would be better than sitting through this again. No, really."
3,"Not a film, but a dance video","The plot? About as detailed as the worst kung-fu I've ever seen.The characters? About as thick as paper.The acting? Up there with your basic porn movie.The dancing? Reason enough to see the film.I can barely remember the plot of Electric Boogolo 2 but I remember some of the dancing. I'm still not sure if there was a plot in Once Upon a Time in China, but the fight sequences stick in my mind to this day. Some of the dancing in this film is great. Maybe it gets on your nerves after awhile, but I think that's only if you are waiting around for the story.If you go into this expecting a ""film"" you'll be disappointed. If you see it as a break dancing showcase, you'll probably be happy. Whether you buy it up to you, I watched on cable, and don't consider it a waste of 90 minutes."
4,EXCELLENT!!!,"This is by far one of the best dance movies I have ever seen. True enough the acting could have been better, but I think B2K did fairly for this just to be their first film. The choreography was sick, and those dance moves were unbelieveable. I must say that I was at least entertained if nothing else, and I haven't been able to say that very much lately about any film."
3,You Got Served,"Hy im looking for a song is played in the second dansing battle of the movie You Got Served,the song is the credits of the movie but a dontnow what song is is somebody now this song please send me and @mail to amdsony@hotmail.com thanks."
1,"Dear god, what the hell is wrong with hollywood?","Quite simply put, this has to be one of the worst films ever made. I borrowed a copy of this from work because I saw it listed on IMDB's bottom 100 films. It out ranked such schlocky classics as Manos Hand of Fate, Glitter, and Plan 9 from Outer Space. I knew I had to see this movie.Unlike those other films, this isn't even remotely funny with how bad it was. Every single urban genre cliche is pulled out of the bag and defficated all over in this flick (as if it hasn't already been done enough.) I guess the dancing is good, if you consider acrobatics combined with full body seizures dancing.The saddest thing about this is that it topped the box office in it's opening week. That says alot about today's youth."
1,You got served junk...suckaz!,I'll keep this review brief. This was easily the worst movie of 2004. The whole thing is about two kids whose dance crew is challenged by some preppy wanna-be-black suburbanites who steal the crew's moves thanks to a treacherous friend named Sonny. Omarion and Marques's character fall out over Omarion dating Marques's sister and things get more problamatic from then on. The acting is atrocious and the dance moves might be cool at first but get pretty mundane after a while. Omarion as well as Marques Houston cant act. Lil Kim looks like recovering heroine junkie and the attractive Jennifer Freeman(My Wife and Kids) is whiter than Jenny McCarthy. You can tell this was a vanity project for the suspiciously effeminate Chris Stokes. And it still bombed! If you're into a movie all about dancing then go right ahead but if you're looking for something more than a dull dance film with heavily edited dance scenes look elsewhere. You just got served suckaz!
3,better than expected,It didn't live up to the hype as the next breakin but we all know there will never br another breakin. but as far as the dancing goes it was good but acting wise ............no. The story line was so so. I watched it expecting to see the next turbo and ozone but maybe in he next lifetime
3,The dancing is good..,"I thought this movie would be good becasue of all the preivews i saw about it, but boy was wrong. But the don't get me wrong the whole movie is not bad becasue i did rate it 3 stars. The only think i like about the movie is all the dancing and the music other than that there's nothing to love. Me and my friends and sisters just watch the dancing parts when were feeling bored or else they will want to watch something else. The acting stinks, the transitions from scence to scence are horrible, the storyline is not all that great. I would reccomend this if your love B2K and/or dancing."
1,Complete Garbage,"This doesn't even deserve one star. The film deserves to be removed from every DVD shelf and erased from our memories.This film is complete bulls--t. It's almost worse than Battlefield Earth. In fact, this film makes Gigli worth your time. It's that bad.Do your soul a favor, do your brain a favor; don't watch this movie. It'll make you 100 percent stupider."
5,Great Movie,"This is a great movie if you like to dance, it makes you wanna get up and dance with the boyzzz,The only sad thing is that unfortunatley the boyz of B2K have broken up, But should definitley watch the movie and see how true there friendship is !!! They are great on the big screen its sad that we may not see them work togeather again:(..."
3,I Can't Lie But Read Before You Vote,I watched You Got Served knowing it was going to be bad but I was wrong. I figured it was just a movie that was a definite moneymaker because basically every girl in the world loved B2K when it came out and they were going to go see it just for that. The story was weak and the acting was below weak and I was disappointed because it seemed Marques Houston watered down his acting skills so he wouldn't outshine B2K. Even though the movie itself isn't good based on acting skills and story it's still very entertaining.You can hate boy groups and B2K or IMX or whatever but the truth is they dance the movie right into worth watching. The things they did in this film are crazy and it takes a lot of talent to do what they did. I can't lie and say this movie was trash and horrible because it's a pretty good movie when they're not talking. It's a change of pace and it will certainly have you watching it over again to get every move.
2,Hip yet vapid.,"Good all around dance movie that does not hold up very well after you see it because the story is not very good out side the dance numbers that surround the movie. B2K do well for this kind of movie but we have seen this plot before, and done much better than this.Wait for video."
3,It's A Revolution,"You Got Served was a movie made to target the urban kids of America. There was no real plot, but there was a great set of dance moves that most people only wish they could do. The director (Chris Stokes) did not intend to make this an in-depth detailed movie; he just wanted people to start to recognize the new hip-hop movement. The ""Dance Off"" at the end was not just something they made up; there are real competitions like that today. They were not able to take any actor to do this movie, so they had to get a talented dancer, with some acting abilities. B2K was a good choice, because they fit the part of the black kids from LA, and they also had the talent to pull of their characters. I agree this would have been a better movie if it was just all dance, and not attempting any plot, but there were still people who enjoyed it and are recognizing the new wave of dancing."
3,no voice sound,you can see the movie but u cant hear it. this dvd is so good to watch but what i am disappointed about is u cant hear it
1,WORST.MOVIE.EVER.,"I am so sad. I will never get this hour and a half of my life back. This movie is not even funny bad, it's just BAD! I couldn't even finish it and I usually love cheesy dance movies. The South Park spoof of this movie was 1000 times better, but those guys actually happen to have brains. The B2Gay guys are awful actors and should never be on screen again. Do us a favor and disappear forever. Please don't waste your time watching this movie because I really regret wasting mine. The only reason why this movie makes me happy is because it inspired one of the greatest South Park episodes I've ever seen. Nobody does it better than tap dancing Butters."
1,Biggest Pile of Crap of the Year,"If you gave this movie more than 1 star, you should be dragged into the street and shot. No questions asked, automatic execution. To like this movie you must be one of the most pathetic, brainless, MORONS ever to crawl the face of the Earth. Please do the world a favor and jump of a building."
1,Put John Travolta in You Got Served Again,"I used to always make fun of this movie with my friends but I had never seen it. Then one day I noticed that it was on HBO so I decided to see if it was as bad as i said it was. I almost threw-up, I missed some of the beginning of it but the part that I started at said it all. It was just a dance scene for 20 minutes with people yelling,"" Oh Snapp!"" and ""You Just Got Served."" If you like this movie you are possibly the dumbest person on the planet. Oh and about the title, I just saw Civil Action and thought that John Travolta would be a hilarious addition to this movie, if i was the writer all I would put down on the script would be Travolta, whenever I think of him I see gold."
2,GOOD CHOREOGRAPHY! TERRIBLE MOVIE,The dance moves in this movie is da bomb but the story-line and the acting is terrible.
1,This Movie Was Craptastic! (That's a bad thing),"Whoa! No wonder the first ten minutes of the movie was the undergound dance battle - the dancing was the only good thing about this pathetically written and horrifically acted movie! Even the somewhat seasoned actors were crappy! The whole story line was a joke! The two main characters were drug dealers for crying out loud! And then lame 'ole Steve Harvey ""I knew a few people on the police department and I pulled some strings..."" Get real! And Omarion, Lil' Fizz whatever he calls himself, smiled so much throughout the whole movie that MY cheeks began to hurt! Fortunately I rented this joke so I'm only out $4. I want to support black artist (directors, actors, producers, writters) I would just like to see us produce something of quality worthy of support. Seriously."
3,My favorite dancers,were in this movie so that was the main reason why I had bought it. Plus I had recognized Marques Houston from Sister Sister and I wanted to get the movie even more.
4,Dance cassic,My boys are very much into dance/battle movies lately so I decided to show them this one. I have seen it numerous times and could watch it over and over :)
3,Good movie,I don't usually choice to watch this movie. It is a cool movie with all of the dance moves. But I think it is a little boring. The only parts I like is when they battle.
3,good quality,The movie came earlier than I expected. Also it show really well. I plan to order more. Thank you very much.
1,YOU GOT to be Kidding!,"I have known for awhile that I'm just not as young as I used to be. At the opening night of CLUELESS, it was painfully evident when all the kids around me were literally jumping up and down in their seats at the clever wisecracks on the screen, and me and my friend were looking at each other with puzzled stares wondering what exactly we were missing. Now, a decade later, it has happened again. Only this time the adults seemed to enjoy the movie as much as the kids were. Somehow, amongst the horrendous acting and over-the-top scenarios, an entire theatre of kids and adults alike couldn't be more satisfied. People were even making fun at just how bad some of the lines were delivered, but yet the second the music came back on, all was forgiven. Sadly, I missed the boat. It takes a little bit more than great choreography to keep me entertained these days. However, I'm in the minority. I guess this just isn't my genre."
1,"Oh god, was this bad or what...","This movie was so bad that I'm not sure I even want to waste my time with a review, but alas, I must say SOMETHING. Plot is horrible, just plain horrible. I'm embarassed for the cast, although it's not like they'll put out any better movies themselves, but still, this is beyond horrid. I will say that I love Meagan Good, mostly because she's hot, but in 'Brick' she showed promise for maybe she'll mature into a better actress as the years press on. Other than the horrid plot there is some MTV dancing that is really the only reason to watch this film, and the dancing is pretty cool, but a movie like 'Honey' has the same dancing but a slightly better plot so I'd say skip this drivel and watch something else, like a music video, at least thats over in five minutes!"
2,"DANCING=4, ACTING=1, SCRIPT=0","Chris Stokes needs to go back to school and learn how to script write and make a better plot line then this crap! Marques Houston had been in the acting business since the tender age of 12 and he's acting was terrible! Omarion was awful, only thing he brought to the table was the dancing. Poor Raz-B (Chris Stokes's cousin) and Lil Fizz had bad lines throughout the movie. The made Lil Fizz into the cry baby. The only people that was fun through out the movie was J-Boog, the kid that played Lil Saint, and Megan Good. Everybody else was whether lame or dull!"
2,*think first,"if you wanted to see this movie, you're better off waiting till it comes out on rental *which it did.i knew, right from the get go, the storyline was going to be a load of crap. the acting sucked, mainly because of the people they chose to ACT in the movie, but i went to go see if for the moves. the moves were pretty damn good; i see nothing wrong with a person going to see it just for that."
5,MEMORIES,"When I was a baby , 1963, My family had a ""45"" of this record. When my Mom passed away 6 years ago and had her sale we told the auction staff to stay out of a cabinet 3 times because we had old records and keepsakes in there.nknown till after the sale they went in there a 4th time . This was one of the keepsakes missing. My older brother wil be So happy to know I found this through Amazon. Thank you and Merry Christmas from the Markles."
3,Very sweet and gently humorous,"I have been involved in small-town community theatres for 26 years and I LOVED this movie, as did my teenage son who watched it with me. We were able to correspond nearly every character to someone we knew from our own theatre experience and laughed until we cried at some of the antics. It's a little sentimental and is not the belly-laughing spoof of ""Waiting for Guffman"". It's more aligned with ""A Midwinter's Tale"" by Kenneth Branagh. But it is DEFINITELY worth a look."
5,This is what theater is like !,"If you have never experienced community theater, this show is excellent to watch. Or if you have acting experience this show is also a must see.Recently , I had my first role in a play. After the play was over, a friend suggested watching ""Bigger than the Sky"". This movie describes very well what community theater is like for a first time actor."
4,A Pleasant Surprise,Enjoyable. Will most appeal to those who like to root for underdogs. Marcus Thomas is convincing as a untalented novice. One of his best moments comes in a scene with Sean Astin. Patty Duke will double your pleasure. Film also pays tribute to those for whom theater is a labor of love.
4,funny movie,I liked it so much I bought it for a distant family member and had it shipped to her asap
4,Fransican Joy in Created Things,"Anne Porter's volume of poetry ""An Altogether Different Language"" is salve for souls aching from post-modernism. Her sparse but lyrical poetry finds ""fransican joy in created things,"" as her editor David Shapiro put it. Her subjects are nature, God, and loving relationships. Anne Porter was not a poet by trade, but wrote these over the course of 60 years. She was in her-mid eighties when they were finally published in this volume, which was a National Book Award finalist."
3,Not Built for Comfort,"This wing chair and ottoman are very attractive and a pretty navy blue--much lighter than the the photo shows. I really like the way this set looks setting in the corner in my living room. Which is the only reason I could give it even three stars, because it sure is not comfortable. Also, no one ever sits in that corner. The seat of the chair is small and hard. This is the kind of chair you reserve for company you don't want to stay long.I should also note that this set seems quite sturdy and is heavy. If you pretty much want this set to be a decorative accent, you're good to go on this. Also, the price is a pretty good deal. Overall, three stars is fair."
4,Let's get ready to rumble!,"This is a compilation of some of guitarist Link Wray's best songs. It does a good job of covering some of the highlights of his career. Most of the songs are instrumentals, but there are three songs that feature Link's bluesy vocals. Link played guitar in a ""dirty"" style with a lot of feedback, but there is actually a wide variety to the instrumentals here. This is a solid compilation. I recommend it to fans of rock instrumentals."
4,"Remember the ""Hoods?""","What a discovery to make on Amazon -- the one and only Link Wray, guitar hero of the high school hoods of the late 50s! (The ""clicks"" were listening to Doo-Wop.) I remember hearing Rawhide and Dixie-Doodle when I was about 10 years old (and haven't seen those 45s since. These were the years when rocknroll was born. Before the Stones introduced white America to the Blues and what was then called Rhythm & Blues, Link Wray was doing an almost one-man job of it. Well, Elvis gets a lot of credit, too. In any case, this is a classic anthology by an important link in the chain."
2,The missing Link,I had a brief listen to this album on line but should have probably listened to more of the tracks available before I bought it. Very disappointing. Not recommended to anyone other than a die hard Link Wray fan.
3,Only for late middle-aged 1950's music fans!,"The title song ""Rumble"" was one of the ""rebel"" songs of the '50s. Other than that and a couple of other cuts that were hits at the time, this album probably deserves the obscurity it already has. From an historical viewpoint, it's interesting to note how much the style of electric guitar players has changed over the years, having reached a level of sophistication unheard of in the '50s."
1,"If you want chronic hairballs, UTI's, kidney disease then feed it","Honestly this food is horrible, cats shouldnt be eating kibble in the first place because it keeps them in constant state of dehydration(they dont drink a lot of water like dogs), they may be fine for the first 10 years of their life, but its not normal for cats to develop all these health issues that are directly linked to dry, grain heavy food.My own cat was vomiting on weekly basis, until I switched to grain free food.Check out a website called catinfo . org, its written by a very smart and educated vet."
1,Horrible food!! Should be called Pukerina,"This food is so bad. It's so high in carbs that my cat gets a sugar high off it and half the time pukes it right back up. It's nearly all corn meal!! What the heck? Cats are not suppose to eat corn, no wonder my cat pukes it back up.Stay away from Pukerina, these corn base high carb cat foods just give cats weight problems, kidney problems and who knows what else."
1,bag was busted,I ordered this catfood and we recieved it on time..however the bag was busted and the food was everywhere. Out of a 7 pd bag I got less than half. The other idems were ok. Catfood is just one of those things that you dont order
2,Hairballs galore,"I usually choose from a variety of the higher quality cat foods. I make sure they are especially made for indoor cats -- something that cuts back on hairballs and helps the cat maintain a healthy weight. My husband bought this Purina Cat Chow because it was on sale and very inexpensive. All of a sudden, my cat has been doing nothing but throwing up hair balls. This was never a problem before. We're going to be switching back to premium cat foods. They cost more, but they're worth it."
4,Taste great; less filling.,My cats will only eat Purina Cat Food. I have tried Iams and other leading brands but they just refuse to eat it. I do not have a problem with this because my cats seem to be happy and are not overweight or seem unhealthy. I think my cats would be annoyed if I was try another product so we remain loyal and satisfied customers.
4,Great stand,I like it because it doesn't take up too much room and was easy to put together. Perfectly matches the Crosley entertainment center.
4,The nuts and bolts in interior designing,"I have often looked for answers found in this book - terminology, forms and details, symbols, plans, how to measure, how to choose colors, how to...Excellent reference to understand the process of choosing interior designs elements."
4,Good Movie that deserves a better title!,"I have no idea what the makers of this film were thinking when they titled this film. But despite the horribly cliched title this film is funny, charming and romantic. I would reccommend it to any romantic movie fan because I don't think that this film will disappoint!!"
1,If you like dance movies this movie is not for you,This movie claims to be a movie about a man's struggle between his two loves....his girlfriend and dance. well he must not love dance too much because you never see it in the movie. Don't waste your time or money on this movie.
2,"Coundown Singers ""Bye Bye Bye"" Review","Now, everybody should know by now that original is best. Now not to say they tried but these ""Countdown Singers"" are no 'N Sync, they are no Backstreet Boys, and they are no Britney Spears. Now if I were you, through time, I would buy the individual CDs and CD singles of these great songs. The reason for the even 2 stars is because they actually had the brass to put something like this out, yes these guys probably can sing, but they covered these originals and I won't say they did horrible but it was below average, I would say the instrumentals were superior to the originals but that's about as far as I go. I would recommend this CD to anyone who digs cover songs but I would highly not recommend something like this, as I say it again, buy the originals if you really wanna have a cool jam session in your room or secretly in your office at work. Peace!"
3,Nobody can speak Danish except for the Danes,"It's not a bad book, it's just that it's impossible to pronounce Danish (without vomitting your meal). Try learning Swedish instead. Easier to pronounce and the Danes should understand you (if they don't speak English)."
2,not bright enough.,Product was originally specified as a fog lamp. Thought the description was less than accurate. Durable package. This item was before its time.
5,Avid Reader,"::GRIN:: I had to chuckle about the one star reveiw. No fault can be put on Julie Garwood for the fact that 'Mercy' has been translated to other languages. That would actually be an encouraging point to read her books. I've read the historical as well as her modern fiction. I'm a fan all around, but I have to admit that her FBI/crime romance series has me constantly checking for the next addition. Mercy kept me interested, and guessing, from open to close. It would be a wonderful addition to anyone's library."
1,Boring!,"I started this book with great expectations that were dashed within the first 20 pages. I will give most any book 100 pages but, I have had enough already at page 50. I agree with above that the professor is too stupid to be real and this book is sheer boredom. I doubt I will waste my time with any of Hassler's other books."
3,Heats good but keeps popping breaker,"Puts out a lot of heat, looks good and has nice features but keeps popping a breaker and leaving the room in the dark."
1,This heater is junk,"I've tried twice now to believe in this product, but each time there has been something wrong with it. The first heater lasted just one winter. The following winter I went to use it and it would NOT shut off automatically. The second heater did the same thing right out of the box. Save yourself the headache and buy another brand that will last longer than six months."
5,Lasko 6410 Designer Series Oscillating Ceramic Heater,The heater is small but works very well to provide supplemental heat in an average size room. Several times this past winter there were cool spots in the lower level of our home and this heater provided just the right amount of added heating to make the room comfortable.
4,Excellent Heater : Controls need improvement,We just received our unit two days ago from our son as an anniversary gift. This is a fine little heater. The appearance is certainly a good attempt to be more stylish than the average electric heater and it certainly puts out the heat.The controls seem to be a failed attempt to be cute and/or stylish. Most of the buttons and beeps are unneccessary. A simple rheostat control to adjust temperature AND provide infinite heat settings would be very much appreciated. I would agree with other reviewers that the fan is a bit noisy but seems acceptable to me at this price point.Right now it is mid-February and the winter has been expecially brutual this year here and in many parts of our country. We are most grateful and pleased to add this heater to our home in Central Iowa.
4,Small but very effective in warming up a large bedroom,"This space heater may be small, but it can warm up a bedroom really fast. Only thing is that the electronic pad is not well done. Very cumbersome to use.Otherwise, it is a good economical way to warm up room."
4,Just what I needed,"This is great heater, best used for small spaces. Even in larger rooms, I position the heater to warm small spaces - 8x8. I like the oscillation function also. I normally use this in areas where there are drafty spaces. After using it, I gave one to my son for his apartment and recommended it to friends. In fact, I'm going to buy a second one for my cabin upstate New York where temperatures often are below 0 in the winter."
4,This heater is great,"I have had one of these Lasko Heaters for my bedroom, but I just purchased two more. It easy heats up my 24x24 living/dining room. I have to leave my bedroom (12x12) door open because it gets to hot during the night, even on a medium setting. It does have an automatic shut off if it tries to overheat which is one reason I like this model. The only thing that I don't like is the color (gray). I would like to see more colors available to suit everyones decor."
5,floor heater,Purchased this as a gift for my mom for Christmas based on functionality and appearance. My mom received the heater in a timely manner and says it works great.
2,Worked for 2 months then died,Worked pretty well although the strong plastic smell wasn't great....now after two months it won't turn on. Not happy at all.
4,Hot product :),"This heater is outstanding. Our house has a portion below grade that never seems to get warm (think a really nice finished basement). When used in the bedroom in this area, does a great job of heating up our area. Our little dog LOVES to sit in front of it and fall asleep. Sometimes when she is asleep, she slides off her bed and literally contacts the heater. The reason for writing this is that the heater does not burn her, or start a fire etc. All around safe, warm, useful and elegant!Pros:Excellent coverage, heats quickly, timed shut-off, beautiful design, oscillatescons:temp control is more another version of ""timing"""
3,Not what i expected,PROSThis heater looks great and heats up a room quickly(25' X 15' < 1 hour) its big and tallgreat for large roomsCONSnot so great for small bedrooms (hard to regulate temperature)when u first plug it in you need to press like 5 different buttons to get the settings u want... annoying loud BEEP every time you press a buttononly oscillates 90 degrees.not a true thermostat... more like a glorified timer
4,looks and works beautifully,"Has smell the first use but no Oder thereafter. We use this heater in our bedroom, so we don't have to heat up the entire house to have a warm bedroom. We also bought another one for our family room. The Winters are very cold where we live. These heaters pay for themselves in comfort and savings for use as area heat."
3,"looks good but, too small for average bed room","It looks like a antique.It is good for individual use, but too small for average bed room.NO handle to move, somewhat noisy."
4,"Nice heater, does the job.","I use this heater in a room about 14'x14' with low ceilings and it can heat it from ~50 degrees to ~70 in about an hour.The heater is not noisy, although for a little while it did have some internal vibration which became audible and was a little annoying... it went away and hasn't returned in several weeks.I like the oscillation feature and the timer, both very useful.I gave it four stars because: There is no way to make it not beep when you turn it on/off or change settings. I sometimes go to turn it on in the middle of the night and the beeping is loud enough to wake my partner sleeping nearby. Also, the cord could be a little longer."
3,Lasko 6410 Designer Series Oscillating Ceramic Heater,"It's got okay air I bought a smaller heater for cheaper that has more power I would suggest the World Marketing 5,200 BTU Electric Convection Heater #NTK15A it's cheaper with more power"
1,Not happy,"I bought this and two other different heaters to try in various rooms in my house to determine which one works best, thinking in the future when I needed a new one I would them get that type. I bought this one, radiator type, and a flat panel one...This one was the worst!!! I tried it in all 3 of my bedrooms and in every single one it blew the house fuse. The other two heaters I tried I have had no problems with!!"
2,This unit gets hot to the touch,"This a cute, small space heater and it quickly warms my bathroom. I originally ordered this to use in a family room. When i received the package I noticed the warning label stating this heater is hot to the touch and should be moved with caution. I wish this information was disclosed in the description because i wouldn't have ordered this. The cord also go hot in 20 minutes of use. It heats well but it's not exactly what i thought i was buying for $40."
4,Works good,Bought this for my grandma in law who doesn't have heat in her house and lives in the mountains. She said it works very good and keeps her nice and toasty
3,Nice but really not powerfull enough,"I live in the Pocono mountains and it gets cold up here. I have an all electric house which during winter months costs me over $ 400 a month to heat. So I bought this heater to supplement ---It heats a room 12x12 but it takes over an hour to achieve a 75 degree temperature.If you really want a good heater, get a propane stove which I now use in place of electric heat. Propane is cheaper to run and my electric bills in winter are around $ 260. This heater is good for small rooms like a bathroom or office. Dont expect a tremendous heat source. I am satisfied for what it does but I cant really give it the praise that other reviewers state. One more thing--the unit is noisy since a fan blows the heat out--so if you are a light sleeper--BEWARE."
4,keeps me cozy!,"We have two of these, one in my little studio, and one in our living room. This little thing kicks out a lot of heat with little noise. The automatic shut off is my favorite feature, as I frequently get caught up in my work and forget about the outside world. I love that there's a remote. I initially thought it was ridiculous to have a remote until one night I was snuggled in bed and realized I forgot to turn off the heater. Magic!The one in my studio quit working after just over a year. It might have had something to do with my dog whizzing on it. The replacement is on it's way and I'll update this review if I have future issues. Right now I think my main issue is a particular naughty dog that whizzes on electronics. ;)"
5,A GREAT BUY !!,"A GREAT VALUE FOR THE MONET !!This small, quiet, good looking heater is a great value !It takes up very little space.The fan is so quiet you have to listen for it.The ""Grecian Urn"" design is a little strange, but looks much better than the classic box shaped space heater.All in all, a great buy for the money!Using Amazon Prime got it delivered on a Tuesday afternoon .......... I ordered it on a Sunday evening!Oh! Did I mention that it was very reasonably priced?It is !!"
1,Not a good purchase..,"I purchased this heater based on all the great reviews on Amazon from others that has purchased it. It only works for 1-2 hours at a time due to the ""over heating"" feature that automatically shuts it off. In addition, the loud beeping noises when switching to the different temperatures is way too loud and annoying. After day two, this heater started to act up, and not only did it shut off after 15 minutes, the oscillating function stopped working. It's going back to Amazon.. Too bad. Was hoping that I would be as happy with this purchase as the rest."
3,odor,"This heater looks great, has all the features you could want, and heats up a room fast. The only problem is the odor! Has anyone else noticed this odor? When I removed it from the box there was a powerful chemical odor. I ran it for about four hours to see if it would dissipate, but it didn't. Is this a common trait for ceramic heaters, or should I return it? It's not a burning odor."
5,Too Cute and It WORKS!,I can't say enough about this heater. I like my bathroom to be cozy warm when I climb out of the shower. Bathroom heaters are pretty much hideous for the most part so I was beside myself when I saw this one. This thing looks awesome and heats better than any small heater I've ever had in my bathroom.I have only used it in a small space. I do not believe it is intended for anything other than a small space.We bought a larger Lasko heater for a game room a couple of years ago and found it to be excellent. That is what prompted me to search out Lasko when I wanted a new bathroom heater. It has a good variety of setting options and does not take up too much space.I am always pleased when I find what I want on Amazon and at a good price. I purchase without worrying about getting ripped off.Go for it!
2,"Good heat, bad programming","I got two of these. Be aware, this has a high and low heat setting, but you can only set the heater to turn off at a certain tempurature on the 'high' setting. This is a problem because the high setting uses enough power that when I had both set to turn on when the tempurature dropped to low the lights in both rooms went out. And later when I only had one on and used my blow dryer, it caused the lights in my house to go out again. I am returning both. Other than this, it heated the rooms very well and I was happy with them."
4,"good heater, poor service","Heater is excellent, at a good price; was received quickly. However, as the package was lacking warranty information AND even some basic instructions on its use, I contacted the vendor at the e-mail shown on their invoice, asking them to contact me about these issues. I NEVER RECEIVED ANY REPLY, OR ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF MY COMPLAINT.However, the product was quite satisfactory. SInce I had originally planned to order TWO (the first vendor showed only 1 in stock), I subsequently ordered a second identical heater from a different Amazon vendor--- AND this one came with the instructions."
5,very nice!,much better than I thought it was going to be. I have a small place and this heats one room very nicely. I bought mine at Rite Aid though.
5,WONDERFUL QUIET HEATER,This heater is not only stylish but quiet. We use it in our Family Room which has a vaulted ceiling. I start it a couple hours before we are going to use the room and it keeps it comfortable while we watch TV. I can keep the thermostat to 65-F in rest of the house and the Family Room registers 73-74. We no longer have to cover up to stay warm. Now with heating fuel predicted to go up 30% I am happy that I can keep 90% of the house cooler and only heat the room we spend the majority of our time. It allows us to conserve energy and still be comfortable. This is the second year we will be using the heater. Other heater fans were so noisy you couldn't hear the TV...this heater is so quiet sometimes you wonder if it is on...great buy! WISCONSIN CUSTOMER
5,Heat!,"We've only had this heater for a couple days. I was looking for something that didn't look like an ugly box, and I found this! Sure, its not really decorative, but it looks much nicer than most heaters.We bought this to off set our insane gas heating bill. Heres to hoping it works.It also has a couple timer settings on it. Press the timer button once, and it sets for one hour, twice sets it for 2 hours, pressing it three times sets it for 4 hours. If you press the timer button 4 times, it will set it for 7 hours.You can also choose which heat setting you want to set it at. From 60 to 85. This heater also has an oscillation mode."
1,Great little heater.,"This heater is the perfect solution to any cold spot in your house. Most highly recommended. Doesn't use much juice and puts out nice warm air. I bought a ""whole room"" heater which doesn't put out 1/2 the warmth this unit does. Get it."
5,Works great,I got this yesterday and put it in the basement. It heated the whole basement -- not just one small area. I was thinking I would need two in order to keep the basement warm in the winters so I thought I would buy one for now and see how it worked. I'm so glad I only bought one! It's all I need! Highly recommended.
3,Nice cabinet but needs some quality control,"I RECIEVED THE RECORD PLAYER CABINET IN FAIRlY GOOD CONDITION. THE BOX WAS SLIGHTLY CRUMPLED AT THE CORNERS BUT ITEM WAS NOT DAMAGED DUE TO SHIPPING. PACKAGING WAS ADEQUATE. THE CABINET TOP HOWEVER, HAD A REPAIRED/RESTAINED SCRATCH ON THE TOP... NOT REAL HAPPY ABOUT THIS. THERE WAS ALSO SOME DARK DROPLETS OF STAIN OVERSPRAY ON ONE OF THE RECORD DIVIDERS. I HAD IT HALF WAY PUT TOGETHER BEFORE I NOTICED EITHER OF THE DEFECTS. THE CABINET LINED UP FINE WHEN PUT TOGETHER.THE STAIN QUALITY WAS NOT UP TO PAR. IN MY OPINION THE QUALITY OF THE CABINET I RECIEVED IS QUESTIONABLE AND CROSLEY NEEDS A BETTER QUALITY CONTROL BEFORE PACKAGES ARE SENT OUT. I DID KEEP THE CABINET BECAUSE I HAD PUT IT HALF WAY TOGETHER AND THE SCRATCH WAS ON THE TOP WHERE IT WAS COVERED BY THE RECORD PLAYER. NICE ITEM, BUT COULD BE BETTER!"
3,Only the pants,"Don't be fooled by the picture or the description, this item only contains the pants not the whole set. The pants run tall, they pull up way above the belly button. Very cool color, washed easily with no fading and limited shrinking."
1,no definition of S M L,apparently those definitions are on the back of the box which is hidden away from us all. i'm off to find a manufacturer with better marketing techniques!
3,Children enjoyed them but a few things to be aware of,"These multi-colored (including white) stickers are about an inch high. None of the stickers had dots on them so the photo was a bit misleading. Several of the stickers weren't punched out properly and were a bit mangled (a small proportion of the total) and some were missing the adhesive and white peelable backing. However, the children (from ages 2 to 9) really enjoyed them."
5,"Actually, very, very good","I bought this book not realizing that the author is a Serious Christian. It does contain a certain number of ""Well, Jesus said to do this..."" type references.But if you blip past the religious references, what you have is a very, very good book on communication in a relationship. I can't compare it against a host of other books, because I haven't read many on this subject. But the author is excellent at exploring and exposing our barriers to communication, and how we can delude ourselves that we are somehow ""protecting"" our spouse by not telling them things.This book permanently changed my view of communications in a committed relationship, and even of communications other than in a relationship. It came too late to help my first marriage, but it will be a very, very important help to my second."
4,Wonderful Reading.,"Although some of these stories can never be verified, they are very interesting to read.I like that there are directions included at the end of each story for those that would like to see where these events happened. I also like that there is a bibliography at the end of each chapter so that the reader can further explore those stories that interest him/her. The pictures are few and far between and are black and white. However, the pictures that are included are relevent to the text.A vern interesting book."
4,cute short book,"Toby and his parents are off on a picnic. Toby decides to lead his parents in a guessing game. He pretends to be all sorts of animals such as a bat, a snake and an owl. Guess what animal Toby will be next along with his parents!The book is great for reading together. It's a book that encourages interaction between the reader of the book and the listener.I would recommend this book to others. It's a quick read appropriate for a toddler with soft illustrations."
2,"Okay, but kinda' flimsy.","Works, but make sure not to tighten this too much, because the metal is not very strong and it will bend easily. It also doesn't have any sort of texture to it to help unscrew it from your lens/filter."
2,2 stars for a bit of nice scenary,"This is one of the most lame wastes of IMAX technology ever created. The backstory is told in the most pathetic fashion. None of the places that the movie explores are named even though they are some of the most iconic villages in Switzerland. Having been to Grindelwald, Zermatt, Lauterbrunnen, etc. it is a shame that none of the aspects of these places were filmed at all. Instead we are treated to some lame family video on the Glacier Express and then a few minutes of ""climbing."" None of the glaciers with the exception of one were located or named. Do not waste you money on this one."
2,Tha Alps,"I do not recomend this DVD ( Bluray). It is not a video about The Alps, but a specific video about the wish of one man to conquest a mountain in memory of his father. I was expecting to see more than 10 typical places( mountains) in Alps, but they show just one.Joao Luis de Freitas - BRAZIL"
1,worst hair mask,"This mask did not work for me. It left my hair dull and tangled. The smell was very bad, could be because the expiration date was 1/2010."
3,Almost perfect carrying case for the Zune player,"The product was delivered in a timely manner and in the condition it was described. In this case it was new and in the original packaging.I was looking for a case to protect my Zune player and this was perfect, well almost perfect. This would have been the perfect case if it had a belt clip. Maybe they will catch it on the next design."
5,Beautiful and touching,"I loved this book, and cherish it in my collection. The stunning illustrations, the sympathetic and entertaining characters, the meaningful lessons learned, and the fresh unique voice all add up to make this a perfect children's book. I highly recommend it to everyone, kids and adults alike. Thank you, Mr. Lyon!"
4,Very good looking.,The wood veneer is very nice. However the nuts assembling the dividers with the table could damage your books or the sleeves of your collectible old vinyl records. A good solution would be covering the nuts with a plastic conic cap. Then the product would be perfect.
4,Styles of Krump,"Our youth librarian requested this title on behalf of a patron who wanted to learn how to street dance. Other dance instructional VHS and DVD movies, such as ballroom dancing, have been popular for years. For anyone who has the agility and the interest, this looks like good exercise!"
4,"Product is adequate, vendor service is fine.","The product is built well enough for its intended use, but I have a 200 foot driveway that is very bumpy and needs repaving. I keep a few spare scrapers on hand for when they snap. It'd be nice if someone made a more substantial one."
3,Left lots to the imagination,"The book was okay. It is evident that the short stories could be books themselves because the authors left the stories open ended. None of the lose ends where tied up at the end of the story. It left a lot to the imagination. True, the book is titles 'Girlfriends' but I'm the type of reader who likes to see what happens in the end. It is a good read, but research others, (""Rosie's Curl & Weave"") before you make a permanant decision."
2,Awright,"Enjoyed Anita Bunkley's story. Sandra Kitt's was so-so. Really got into Eva Rutland's story, but then it ended without telling the reader what the heck happened, which made me furious."
3,Warm stories,"I enjoyed what these writers were attempting to do in creating stories that were romantic as well as typifying relationships between girlfriends. However, I did have a problem with the reality of some of the stories. I have some very close girlfriends & I can honestly say if one of them had done some of the things that these characters did, I could not realistically be so forgiving.. I know the authors are trying to create a nice cozy story, which to a degree this did happen. But come on now, the stories should at least be developed to the point where they evolved to forgiveness.. Overall, the effort was good.."
3,True friendship can overcome many obstacles,"These three stories were about friendships, strong female bonds that endured some rocky times. In each story the main character would have to examine their friendships. They also found love, and had to make a choice between friendship and their lover. Fortunately they were able to have both. These 3 writers are excellent story tellers and they again made a special anthology that was enjoyable."
1,Tired Cliches,I gave this book away after reading the first 10 pages of each story. It is full of tired cliches that the media uses too often to define our woman of color. I was very disenchanted with all of the authors for such poor work.
4,"Good, but could be better","This book contains many ideas on how we can literally change our life just by controlling our thoughts. But I thought it would be a lot better if it's written in a religion-neutral manner. Overall, it's still a good book."
1,what I think,If you didn't expect to be sermonized you may not like this. The first chapter is as far as I will get. This book should be categorized religious.
3,Skip and read the ORIGINAL,"Disclosure: I haven't read this book. But I'm surprised that the author has focused his book on Self-Talk without crediting - apparently - the person who originally conceived the idea, Shad Helmstetter, whose book ""What to Say When You Talk to Yourself,"" is a classic. I really don't respect authors who - allegedly - take others' ideas. Do yourself a favor and skip this and read Helmstetter's original book. He deserves the credit - and the sales."
2,better books out there...,"With all due respect to the author, I did not enjoy this book. Perhaps some people may benefit from it, but I suggest looking for other ones on this topic. To me, it has the feel of being old. Many of the Scripture references are from The Living Bible (as well as the Phillips translation and KJV) which was updated to the New Living Translation in 1996. I haven't read extensively on the mind and thoughts, but a step up (in my opinion) would be Norman Wright's ""A Better Way to Think."""
3,Too Much Goofy in this one,"If your into the KRUMP movement, all of the dvds in this series are a must have"
3,synopsis from back cover,"Jaymie cherished her friend Gretta's mansion and had a vision for its restoration. It needed to be loved-just like Jaymie-and she longed to see it filled once more with laughter, a family, children. But Simon, Gretta's handsome, sophisticated and heartless nephew-was determined to claim his inheritance and crush her hopes. Jaymie would have to fight for her dreams-but was she strong enough to deny her infatuation with Simon?"
5,Does the job,"Good little tool - does the job without too much fuss. I do wish it wasn't so easy to knock off the side of the grill, but with care this shouldn't be a big problem. I like how it integrates very well with the shape of the round grill and doesn't stick out too far. Word of note: highly recommend you put a leather cord through your grill tools' handle hole, as the ends of the holder hooks are flared and do not fit small handle holes well. Making direct contact with the holder will also make metal tools extremely hot!"
5,History comes alive,"The words rang out from Philadelphia, liberty, equality. Not merely a dry, historic document, the Declaration of Independence summed up a century of political thought and years of practical experience governing the colonies. These words brought forth a new nation and are among the most influental ever written. Freedman brings them alive against the backdrop of the times."
2,Stupid Me,"OK...I'll admit it; I got fooled! I didn't read the review carefully enough nor did I do the necessary inspection of the book itself. I was expecting a well written, adult oriented, lengthy, history of the early years of the republic; say from 1730 to about 1810.What I got was a picture book suited to 7th/8th graders at best. The bibliography is a joke. If you have children of these ages in your home, this is a passable book. I don't. For me, the book was a waste of money"
5,Work great!,"Nice tires, good price! Hoping to make more time to get the boat out in the summer months. Need more hours!"
2,A Big Disappointment,"This whole box set was a big disappointment. I could not believe that the whole box set contains only raw footage. These are dvd's that you will surely fast forward through the majority of the footage. There was no indication of what you were watching other than figuring it out on your own and the chapter selections did not match up to the scenes. If you want to watch chapter 4 of something then select it, rewind it for a few minutes and then you will see the beginning of the chapter you selected. This whole set was poorly put together from the outside to the inside. Don't waste your money."
4,Very Cute!!,"I bought this a few months ago in the store and thought this was very cute! I think it is best used in the baby's lap and not attached to the car headrest because it's kind of difficult for baby to reach (depending on the car seat you have). The little spinning ball in the center of the flounder is very interactive. Lots of crinkly tags at the top of the fish. Teething items attached, too! Overall, it's a simply great buy. Can't go wrong!"
4,The second best bride,"Jane Feather wrote an incredible amount of books of which I like her Bride Trilogy a lot. True, Portia's story is a bit unrealistic but that does not refrain it from being a lovely read, which I think Feather is only aiming for. A pity her books don't see the end of the Cromwell revolution, which would cause her quite a dilemma she avoids now."
2,not bad,Light reading material. No need to tax your brain much but entertaing just the same. Cute story but nothing breathtaking.
2,"cute, but not groundbreaking","This book was a cute, sweet and very typical story. We've heard it all before, girl has bad upbrining, finds outlaw (who really isn't an outlaw) falls in love and had to choose who she is loyal too. Mistakes are made and mean things are said. There is nothing new or unique to the plot of this book. I will mostlikly not be continuing with the Bride trilogy.That said, this book was a nice book to read, there was nothing that made be really want to put it down for good, but also nothing to keep it on my collection."
2,Waste of money,"90% of every page is just a big picture. This book is a waste of money unless you like to look at pictures. If you really want to learn how to massage, you are better off getting another book that actually explains it with a small picture showing how the technique works."
5,my sister loved this gift,I purchased this pillow and matching sheets for my sister as a housewarming gift for her bedroom. She loves it and the price was great!!
2,Disappointing quality,"I bought this last week and will be returning it today. While I can usually hear phone conversations OK, the quality of the voice is not very good - usually has some static. The user manual is incomplete and confusing (for example, blinking codes on base display are not explained; words printed on the phone parts are not in the index - the user manual uses different words for the same parts!), editing caller id info in the user directory does not update the corresponding info in the caller id list (phones from Panasonic and Sony do this correctly - AT&T does not). If you want to buy a quality 5.8 GHz phone, try any other brand. AT&T goofed on the quality and design of this one!"
1,Avoid this phone!,"We purchased this phone a few months ago, and it has been nothing but trouble. It is made of cheap plastic, the reception is terrible, and the functionality is extremely limited. Some features make no sense, like the fact that the message voice will tell you the time of day and the year (!) someone called, but not the date of the call. Real junk, you can get better phones for less money--avoid this!"
4,Recent Telephone Purchase,"I purchased these phones at a great price for my parents. They work great. If there is anything negative, it is that you have to remember to push the ""off"" button when you finish the call. My parents are 85 years old, so sometimes they forget and the phone rings busy for hours. Otherwise, great purchase."
5,Fantastic DVD collection,"I've only gotten through 1954, but so far it is quite good. They've opted to play up some of the charm of each era to complement replaying match highlights, and especially for the older tournaments, they do really well to show many of the goals, tell an interesting story, and impart historical context/information. A great purchase for any football fan!"
1,Boring and unprofessional,"Quite disappointing. Of the games (only some games), you see the goals and nothing else: no tricks, no dribbling, no tackles, no passes, no saves--a very superficial idea of what soccer is about. Moreover, a lot of the footage concerns what happened outside the pitch: but nothing interesting is shown or revealed. The narration is embarrassingly boring and banal, and the clips are cobbled together in a very uninventive, unattractive, amateurish way. Not to mention the elevator music that somebody chose as a soundtrack--it has no connection whatsoever with the images and does not express the spirit of soccer. With its resources, and even without them, FIFA should have produced something much much better. In these DVDs there is no creativity, no professionalism, no soul: just the intention of exploiting to the utmost our passion for soccer. Do not purchase this set."
3,Stainless steel/teflon,"We decided to buy a stainless steel electric skillet because we were tired of always replacing our teflon one. This skillet is nice and shiny. We washed it and rubbed it with oil. We fried bacon at a low temp and increased it, the bacon stuck. We fried sausage, it stuck. I don't know what we are doing wrong but I now hesitate to use it. Today I cleaned it and sprayed it with Pam and rubbed it good. We'll see if that helps. I like the looks of the skillet and hope we can figure out the problem."
5,SS Electric Skillet,I love the stainless steel electric skillet. I'm happy with the cooking - it's easy to titrate the temperature as needed. I especially love to set it to warm and serve from it at a party. It is beautiful!
1,Thumbs down,I ordered the replacement heating element because the original element that came with the Meco smoker lasted just three months. The replacement element lasted three months as well. I bought a new smoker (Brinkman) for 1/3 of the price of the stainless steel Meco smoker. Both times the element failed in the same place- where the rheostat fits on the heating element prongs.
2,this scares me,"I've gone through three elements now in ten years of infrequent smoking. The connection between the control and the element burns, creating a short. The rate of failure seems to be quickening. I'm honestly concerned about the safety of this thing."
4,Law for high school students,This is a great intro to everyday law and government for high school students. Students really need a book like this.
4,Secure and Light,This is a great product for protecting small electronic devices. Foam interior and mesh pockets makes for easy storage and customization. It is light weight so making it easy to travel with. The only problem is that is on the bulky side and it does not have a handle.
4,Well written,"If you want to kow anything about C.S. Lewis' wife, then this is the book that you need to read. Good account of her life, leading up to her marriage to C.S. Lewis."
2,Disappointed in quality,"These shoes are very cute and comfortable. However, I was disappointed in the quality, particularly coming from Clarks. The stitching around the sole of one of the shoes began to come undone about the third time I wore them. The sole remained attached, but it looked bad. The covering peeled off both of the buttons, so now they're just shiny metal. And one of the buttons came off, and I can't re-attach it--currently trying to find a way to do it with super glue. I have an office job and haven't had this kind of problem with a pair of shoes before, so I don't feel that I have been overly hard on the shoes."
4,acoustic live idol!!!!!!!,"this is a great recordit captures steve an billy in rare formthat being a mostly acoustic cdbut enough about detailsyou can read those in other peeples reviews...i just wanted to note that even though this is a story tellers cd,there is no storytelling at all, on the cdif you wanna hear billy talkin bout the songsi guess your gonna hafta get the dvd:-(but its a good record none the lessjust buy it..."
4,Great collection by Billy Idol but..,"This is a great collection of songs by Billy Idol but... I didn't care for track 6 To be a lover, track 8 Kiss me Deadly, and track 11 Ready Steady Go. Rest of the cd is truly a greatest hits of his music just with a new spin on it thanks for VH1. So if you like Billy Idol music and don't mind a great live cd then pick this cd up because for a live album this is still good sounding music on it."
3,Sort of Like a Live Greatest Hits Album,"This culls songs from Billy Idol's Storytellers show on VH1, but it's JUST songs (if you're looking for all the between-songs-stuff, you need to get the DVD instead). Still, it's great to hear Idol dust the cobwebs off of his old hits, ranging from ""Dancing With Myself"" to ""Cradle of Love"". There's not too much to recommend this to anyone who already owns his Greatest Hits or isn't an Idol fan, but you do get to hear him swear when he messes part of a song up, and that's kind of funny."
3,Simply put,"To keep it simple, Steve Stevens is wonderful here. His playing fits well with Billy Idol's music."
3,The best of Billy Idol - unplugged!,"When I see Billy Idol I think about Beavies (MTV's Beavies & Butthead you know) for some reason.This one is a ""best of Billy Idol - unplugged"" and if you got his ""Greatest hits"" I guess that will do. The only reason to spend money on this album is to get the opportunity to hear unplugged versions. The sound is good, some songs do better than other being unplugged. This is mainly for Billy Idol fans or maybe unplugged lovers - others will do fine without this one."
5,Excellent book! Truly engulfing--I couldn't put it down!,"This is one of the first Christian fiction books I have read--it was a great first pick. Michael Phillips has a great way of setting the stage in this story--giving just enough details for the reader to get a firm grasp of the setting and characters without being overly burdensom. The historical background was extremely interesting as well. I was actually transported back in time. I was also truly amazed at how Michael Phillips intertwined the gospel of salvation into the story in a realistic and relevant way. After reading this book, I feel compelled to read every other book from Michael Phillips--especially if they are this good! I look forward to reading the next book in the series."
5,One of the best series I have ever read!!,"I am absolutely fascinated by historical ficiton, and the Secret of the Rose series is no exception. This book became real to me, the characters like actual people who would hear me when I yelled at them or laughed at the things they did. I read the first one on vacation in another state, then could not find the second book. The ending leaves you wondering what is going to happen next, and satisfies you when you finish the series. It is a truly amazing series."
5,What an amazing book!!!,"This book really left you thinking. It brought to light many things that you never noticed about things before. I will never look at a rose the same way again. You have to read the next book after this one! It really left you wondering about Sabina, Matthew, and Baron von Dortmann. A must read!"
5,Only the beginning..,"A first step in the journey of a deeper understanding of the Father's love.A must ""read"" for those who enjoy historical fiction from a Godly perspective.Just finished the last of the Secret of the Rose series...""Dawn of Liberty.""A lot of spiritural digestion to do. Will stay with me forever.Love, Obedience, Forgiveness and more Love = all action words."
5,One of the best I've ever read,"This entire series keeps you spell-bound. This is historical fiction at its best. However, it is also an action packed thriller. I believe those who do not even love historical fiction will enjoy this series."
4,Couldn't put it down,"When I started reading the book and it made reference to the Holocost I wasn't sure how in depth it was going to go on that subject and wasn't sure I wanted to continue reading it. But, I pressed on and the characters just grabbed me. Baron von Dortmann is such a man of God. Read the book - you'll want to read the rest of the series when you're done with #1"
2,Won't read his work again,"Read this about ten years ago. The plot moved too slow for my tastes, and the story didn't start moving until the last chapter--and that was after wading through sermon after sermon and the garden that became very monotonous. Was very disappointed, and this is the book that turned me off to Christian Fiction. I wanted a story, not a sermon. I'm giving it two stars because of the effort of the author and his extensive research."
5,Great Toy,This is one of my daughter's favorite toys and I love that its a soft way for her to learn to put things in and take things out.
5,Bath Toy,Fun group of bath time fun toys! Each toy makes a different sound and several different textures to experience as well.
3,No more water.,"I just ordered this product for my son because all the reviews stated that it was an awesome product with the water and things floating in the bowl etc. I recieved the item which came brand new in box and it had no water in it or floating things. I called Learning Curve, number on bottom of box, and they said that they have changed the product so it no longer has water in it. The pictures are all showing the bowl with water, so please just realize it will no longer have water. They say that quality control is aware of the box showing a different product, but it is the same thing. It is still very adorable, and i plan on using it anyways!"
4,Cute,"cute and variety of fun tactile experiences, good for hand/ eye coordination. My sons both like to play with it."
3,Simply Fun Toy,I bought this for my 6 month old cousin for Christmas. My 11 month old daughter has liked playing with this toy since she was 6 months old. She likes to take the fish out of the bowl and put them back in. Great for motor skills. The water filled sides of the fish bowl are fasinating to her too. Mom likes this toy too because it doesnt make any noise.
1,not what it is pictured to be,"The pictures of this toy are incorrect, there is no water-filled sides with sea creatures in it. Without that feature it is nowhere near as cute, and we never would have requested it as a gift for our infant. The pictures must be out of date for this item."
1,Big surprise...........,I FEEL TOTALLY CHEATED!!! I just got this toy today and after reading the reviews about it I was so excited to get this for my little boy. The big surprise I was refering to is that there is no water inside the plastic on either side like the picture makes you believe. And I do not see anyway to add the water myself. There also are no little creatures inside the plastic that were supposed to be floating in the water. I am very disappointed with this. I feel like it was false advertising and way overpriced when you find out that the coolest part is not included. I am very upset because I thought this was going to be such a neat toy. I will not be purchasing anything from Lamaze ever again. I strongly recommend no one else does either because you do not get what you paid for.
2,doesn't have water-trapped sides as pictured,This is a cute product but definitely not as cool as what is pictured and described. There is no trapped water; the sides are just plain plastic. I ended up returning it because without the water-trapped sides I felt it was pretty overpriced.
3,"No water, no evidence water could have disappeared.","A friend ordered this for me off my Wishlist, and there is no water, water stains, nothing to indicate it's the same item exactly as the box - and Amazon - describes. Just a single layer or clear plastic on either side of the fishbowl - definitely intentional and not a defect. I was VERY disappointed and in a way feel cheated. I guess my infant will not know the difference but the water should have been in the item, or Amazon should have doen a better job QC'ing their products! Still love Amazon though!"
5,LOVE!,"Bought this for a friends baby shower gift. I loved it so much I added it to my baby registry the next day! No fancy bells or whistles, no batteries, just good old fashioned stuffed animal toys :)"
1,Great book but you can live without it,"This is a good reference book if you are a graphic designer or into typography. However, you can live without buying it. Typefaces are everywhere on the internet and can well try text for free.PRO's: good reference for printed typefaces.CAVEATS: you will have to purchase and have it in a book shelf most of the time. Reading it will make you proficient in telling the alphabet in so many directions along with ordinal numbers ( 0 to 9). That is, it is a reference book, not for reading. Cheaper to print from the internet the font you may need."
4,Graphic Design Reference,Much like a dictionary of useful font styles. Very helpful for graphic design work and web page design when looking for specific type to blend in with graphics. Especially good for advertising brochures and flyers. Also contains Greek alphabet and numerous symbols.
5,Indispensable index saves time,"I have zillions of fonts on my computer, but only have the essentials loaded in my Font Book, so this guide helps me find the fonts I want. It is essential for anyone who needs special fonts or someone who is, like me, picky about which fonts are used in a project. There is a section at the beginning of the book that has an easy guide to types of fonts, then there are sections with fonts grouped according to their characteristics such as serif, sans serif, script, etc. Then in the back, each font is listed and a the entire font family is printed as well as a sentence, too, so you can see how it looks and flows. I love it."
2,great concept but implementation sucks,"I like the idea of using light and vibration to wake you up. I like the big display and the vibration alarm. However, the clock has major disadvantages that are:- the display is way too bright and cannot be dimmed- the strobe is not bright enough- every few days the display starts blinking (usually indicates power loss), even though I had the backup battery installed"
1,Fax paper jamming device,"Although the speed and quality of the print is very good, the constant problem of the fax taking more than one sheet at a time and jamming the mechanism has made it impossible for us to continue using this in our office. It will grab upwards of 8 to 10 sheets at a time, so the only way to get a fax printed from our hp 3150 is to have an employee sit and manually feed each sheet into the fax machine. We ordered an aftermarket fix to solve the problem, which was recommened by a service shop that also has had experienced this jamming problem from other owners bringing this fax in for repair, and the afermarked fix also did not work. After a frustrating year with the HP 3150, we are scrapping this model and shopping for a new fax machine."
5,perfect arm rest,I'm on the Computer for hours a day. The edge of the desk was digging into my arm. This product helps to cushion your arm from the the hard corner of a desk. It was exactly what i was looking for and i am thrilled with my purchase.
1,Old Kyoto: Old Kyoto: The Updated Guide to Trad.,"3 people tried to use this book. 13, 45, 60 years of age. Print is way to small to read. We left it on a train for someone with microscopic vision....."
5,Kyoto's Finest,"Are you visiting Kyoto? You'll find that this book will help you to see the old traditional Kyoto. It gives some history, background, and cultural information on old Kyoto. The meat of this book gives information on shops, restaurants, and inns which represent old Kyoto. Each one covered gets about two or three pages of description, so you can get a lot of information about each place featured, and you can really understand why each place is special. Because the descriptions are so complete, you can enjoy reading about these places even if you aren't going to Kyoto.I'm a resident of Kyoto, and I find that most of the places listed in this book aren't in the mainstream guides, so if you pick up this book in addition to a mainstream guide, there won't be much overlapping. Also the places list here really give you a feel for old Kyoto. If you have a few days in Kyoto, you should definitely stop by a few of these places."
4,A Must Have For Seeing The Real Kyoto,"I wanted to visit the old shops of Kyoto, where they have been doing their craft for generations. I was able to find the few shops that I picked out ahead of time. They were all open and many had English literature on their products and history and some even had English speaking employees. So, don't be afraid to visit these charming shops.I gave it 4 stars because although accurate, the book did not give very detailed directions. The articles provided a small map of the cross streets but when you get into the smaller streets, the signs are not in English. I bought a Osaka-Kyoto Atlas before I went and that was a great help in finding the smaller streets.The book is full of traditional shops and inns and I would highly recommend buying it. Just do a little planning the night before and buy a good atlas and you will be fine."
4,Historic corners of Kyoto,"""Old Kyoto"" is not a guidebook, but rather an insider's guide on interesting attractions and mom-and-pop shops you should visit if you are in Kyoto for a while. I read the book cover to cover on the bullet train from Tokyo (it's a short read) and enjoyed it very much. Even though the book focuses on specific attractions with no pretention of tying them all into a coherent story, it effectively gives you a sampling of the history of Kyoto, its industries, and their sensibilities.At the very end of the book the author dedicates a couple of paragraphs to actually planning your trip to Kyoto - wish there was more information there. A chapter on suggested routes through the city, or even a map to place all of the mentioned attractions would have been a great addition to the book."
3,Kyoto is changing fast,"And the dollar against the yen is horrible. Although is is an update, it is out of date with present Kyoto, the traditional places are disappearing to 'progress' or are impossibly expensive. The book is a great read, informative about Kyoto but not that useful as a guide book."
4,Great book to show you the hidden shops and eateries,"My wife and I used this book all of the time while in Kyoto (Spring 2007). The shops in the book were truly some of the better ones although most were on the expensive side. The price does reflect the quality of the products though. Even though we couldn't afford some of the items it was still fun to window shop.Some of the shops that aren't on the main streets are hard to find. It is not the fault of this book, its just that the streets aren't labeled in English style letters so you have no idea where you are. In our experience just ask someone in the nearby shops. They are always willing to help and very polite."
2,"Came damaged, no call back from customer support.","Came damaged, no call back from customer support. Other then that, it works, just blemished on the top."
3,"An excellent ""field guide"" and overview of dog breeds.","I would recommend ""The Right Dog For You"" by Daniel Tortora, Ph.D. in conjunction with this book. Tortora's book is a little dated and doesn't have many of the newer breeds, but when used in conjunction with Walkowicz's book, you get a very helpful overview of many of the dog breeds out there to choose from. Of course, every dog is an individual, but it helps to have a general idea of the breed's predispositions, and Walkowicz's book gives a nice snapshot of the breeds out there."
2,Very Practical,"The reviews were very concise and well focused on the criteria that a prospective owner should consider.The book only covers breeds -- it would also be nice to have a chapter on ""choosing a mutt"" and what the criteria, benefits and pitfalls might be.Color pictures would make it easier to recognize familiar dogs, but, ultimately, it's not vital to decision-making."
3,"Not for the ""Rare Dog Breed"" Enthusiast",This is a good book if you are not interested in searching for a rare dog breed. I could find more information on the internet about dog breeds than this book had to offer. Every single dog breed I was interested in was not covered or even mentioned in this book.
3,Buy the author's other book!,"I rated this book only three stars because the same information, expanded and updated, appears in ""Choosing a Dog for Dummies,"" by the same author. The newer version is worth four or five stars, I believe. Both are easy to use, thanks to the telegraphic evaluations preceding each write-up. Despite there being no color pictures, this is a good reference for the price."
1,This is all surface tension,"For years I have been trying to find a book to replace, The Right Dog for You, by Daniel F. Tortora, because his book now does not include an number of breeds. I thought The Perfect Match might be the one. What a disappointment. I wanted to learn about the breeds and how they react and interact in their environments. Some breeds have more information, but there are no cautions about puppy mills or the effect they have on the breed. There is no consistent information about heriditary defects, the life-span. This is not a buyers guide, it doesn't give you the information to make the educated decision a buyer of this book is hoping to make. I wish Tortora would write another book."
4,Breaks info down into FAQ's,"This is a pretty good book about dog breeds. There is a photo of each breed (black and white). The best thing is at the top of each page all of the info you want to know is broken down in categories. How are they with kids, guarding, energy, size, who that breed is recommended for and who it is not. This book is definitely worth the price. It is a lot better than some of the $60 books about dog breeds. You'll get you moneys worth."
5,loved it,"it was addictive, creative, and thankfully clean. its a book i enjoyed and would encourage my kids to enjoy as well. it is well written."
4,"Some great, creative songs, but inconsistent album","This is a band that can be both unique and amazing and sometimes a little meandering and directionless. When a song of theirs works, it generally works very well. When it doesn't I find myself a little bored.The songs I like:You Can Call It YoursI Never Know Where You AreAll That Matters NowOver and OverWaiting on the WireWave After WaveSo you might want to pick it up the album or these songs separately.Their best songs have to do with love, being agonized by love and that kind of thing. They often start out slowly and build to amazing crescendos and layers of guitar and overdubbed vocals. Their sound is a little like Echo and the Bunnymen, only perhaps rawer, and less orchestrated and exotic.""All That Matters Now"" and ""Wave After Wave"" kick me in the side of the head when I hear them. They are a seriously underrated and unknown band for how good some of their songs are--probably because they're a little inconsistent."
3,Basic info:,"Breathless was an English band which existed since 1980s, led by Dominic Appleton, who made a guest appearance on 4AD's This Mortal Coil's ""Filigree and Shadow"" album. Fans of TMC would defiately like this. Definately shows a less emo side of Dominic Appleton."
4,as described,Product is as described. I haven't watched it yet but assume it plays ok. Looking forward to giving this as a gift. I haven't yet decided who the lucky person will be.
5,NICE TO GO BACK IN TIME WITH THIS ONE,"This is a simple story of a little turtle, Pinkie, in search of someone to play with. Pinkie approaches quite a number of the other forest critters and is rejected (nicely) by all of them for various reasons; cannot climb trees like the squirrels, fly like the birds, etc. Finally, of course, Pinkie finds a perfect playmate. The illustrations by Dutz are qute nice, water colors and black and white drawings and fit well with the story line. All in all a delightful book out of the early 50s. Recommend this one."
1,This is a junk,"I've been looking for compression sleeve puller here and there. As a contractor, when you have too many to replace, this task can be a big chore. I came across to this one not long ago. I used it twice and the hadle broke. On the first use, the sleeve was loose enough to come out easy. However, the second use, the sleeve was tighten so hard that it was hard to turn the handle. A few turns after, the handle could not resist and broke. I don't understand why they didn't use thicker handle. If I were them, I'd put 1/4"" hexagonal quick connection for an impact drill gun instead of turning with your hands. Stupid design with wrong material."
4,A portrait of life in Cuba before the takeover of Castro.,"Although this book emphasizes sports events, it provides a portrait of Cuban society before the Castro dictatorship. It shows that it worked efficiently to produce understanding and cohesiveness among the different classes. The author brings into his personal vignettes many important personalities. Many of them later became leaders in the communist regime instituted in 1959, including Castro himself. A number of important events occurring during the Batista years are recounted, based on intimate knowledge of the participants by the writer. The book is written in a lively colloquial style, and charms the reader to finish it in one sitting."
4,Havana in the 50's,If you have been in Havana or are interested in Cuba this is a must in your Library.
1,Crappy,These came with a broken stand and you cant have them work unless you have a cigerate lighter freed up in your car. They suck.
3,Broken part,I bought a StreetGlow Led Projector Light in December and I am receiving it just right now. Every thing came perfect except one of the plastic projector holder came broken!
4,as good as the others.,"If you enjoy his writing, you will enjoy this one. It made me laugh out loud and giggle after wards."
2,Not Sedaris,I was looking for something close to David Sedaris' humor and writing. Just doesn't comapre.
2,"Subtlety, please","Its not that Mr. Burroughs can't write, its more that he is unable to tell a story without hitting using a club to get the idea across. Augusten, try a little subtlety. If you don't make every sentence so maximally dramatic, the stories become not only more believable but also more personal."
3,"Well, not what I thought it would be","I had heard of his previous book, and to be quite honest, this book really sucks. He is out of my normal reading spectrum, and I thought it would be a fun and interesting read. I was wrong. I felt as if I was in the horrible saga of a gay neurotic mind. I guess that was the point of the book, but how was I to know that going in? I read the whole thing in one morning and threw the book in the trash. I actually felt irritated after I read it. He is an easy read, and I guess a book like this has it's audience, but I'm not it. And even his audience would get sick of his self-centered psychotic behavior."
2,"Very, very disappointed.","I was a devout Burrough's fan until I read this book. Any good material in this book was overshadowed by Burrough's chapter about his attitude toward his admirers. He regards them as pathetic, self-pitying, over-disclosing nightmares. I lost all respect for this author whom I onced revered."
2,Disappointing but I needed more Augusten Burroughs,"I read this after reading Running With Scissors and Dry. I love his 'voice' and his dark smart-alec sense of humor but this was not a novel it was a hodge podge, mish mash, stew of stories, some of which were previously published in his other books. I felt cheated and insulted by this book having already read many of the stories contained therein. But when I was done I still wanted more from Augusten Burroughs. I thought the two other memoirs were very well done. Dry was great even. This one wasn't even close"
2,"Oops, He Did It Again","I read 3 books by Burroughs (""Running With Scissors"", ""Dry"", ""Wolf At The Table"") before this bunch of stories. And all plots were familiar for me, but another thing seriously disappointed me - these stories are very shallow - I wrote such things in my diary during teens, but I never thought about selling them, 'cos' they are so common, we live our lives, we meet different people, but to sell such diaries in such a pathetic way - no, thank you please, it only makes me sneeze."
2,Augusten Has Jumped The Shark,He's run out of ideas folks. This is just a collection of self-absorbed observations about he world around him. He needs to stop writing for a while rather than push himself to deadlines that only result in this type of mush.
1,wow. this is what you call good writing?,"wow. after reading all the positively GUSHING reviews of Magical Thinking, i rushed out to borrow my friend's copy. SOOO glad i didn't waste money on it! Second rate Sedaris indeed, without the the wit, humor or ability to craft a sentence. so where are all these FANTABULOUS REVIEWS COMING FROM? i don't know... maybe AB himself? (he was in advertising, afterall). especially the reviews where he compares himself to Dave Eggers and Jeffrey Eugenides. ha! who are you fooling? save your money folks. read a real author."
2,Mailing It In,"This is a rarity for me - I didn't finish this book. I read and very much enjoyed Burroughs' two memoirs, Running With Scissors and Dry. Magical Thinking is a collection of stories which has the definite feel of cashing in on the success of those two.Burroughs has freely admitted to being a compulsive diarist. These stories have the feel of being plucked from his diary and perhaps dressed up a little. The most enjoyable are the story of his escalating battle with a cleaning lady and a sketch of his altogether different brother. The rest - well, I don't remember much.Jaklak sez check it out if you're into gay dating. Otherwise, keep on walking."
1,Disappointment,"A thoroughly lazy (pieced together from journal entries), self-indulgent and poorly written book by a Sedaris clone."
5,Pure Entertainment,"1. Augusten Burroughs2. Chuck Palahniuk (although I thought ""Stranger Than Fiction"" was a yawner.)3. David Sedaris4. Neal Pollack (someone light a fire under him.)5. Dave EggersIt's not so much that I love this book...I EXPECTED to love it and I was not disapointed. Mr. Burroughs is the master. I can't wait for more fiction though. The story about the Dr. Pepper lady...even Augusten admits there is a limit to this type of account.I do have a problem being a divorced forty-two year old mother and reading books like this...I have absolutely no one I can recommend them to.(and he's right about the alpha hydrox....10% acid on your face and neck after a hot shower and we'd all look 30 well into our fifties!)"
2,Marginally Funny,"Readable, vaguely funny, but at times bordering on self-indulgence - comes across as an insecure individual obsessing over his receding hairline and needing to feel congratulated for his wit, which isn't quite as sharp and biting as he thinks it is..."
5,Honestly Hilarious,"This is what good writing is all about. Flow, plot, intrigue! Everything is excellent in this book!I LOVE LOVE the chapter about the little girl who kicks Augusten...had me laughing out loud, literally. I was appalled by the rat story and absolutely stuck to the book reading about the scamming housekeeper! I could not put this book down and I can't wait for the next Augusten Burroughs book!5 stars, I completely recommend this book to everyone, reguardless of literary preference!"
5,Burroughs is brilliant!,"Augusten Burroughs has a knack for satire and other aspects of dark humor. I loved his novel Sellevision and looked forward to reading more books by this talented author. Magical Thinking is one of the funniest short-story collections I have ever read. This darkly funny collection will have you in stitches of laughter while at the same time making you shake your head with disgust at some of the bold scenes, raunchy situations and disarming language in the stories. This book is even darker in content than Sellevision! My favorite stories are ""Transfixed by Transsexuals,"" ""Model Behavior,"" ""Holly Blow Job,"" ""I'm Gonna Live Forever,"" ""My Last First Date,"" and ""Cunnilungusville."" Augusten Burroughs is one of the most talented authors out there and I cannot wait till he releases another novel. In the meantime, I think I will give his memoirs a whirl."
1,ARE YOU PEOPLE CRAZY?,"This is, quite possibly, the worst book I've ever read. I don't understand how the previous reviewers could find any redemption in Burrough's new book---there's nothing magical about it. These stories are pointless, bitter, uneven, and offer nothing even insightful about the human condition---more importantly, of Burroughs condition. He continually states how screwed up he is, I guess expecting us to know this from his previous books, but never actually gives us much that is tangible to back it up which just makes it self-deprecating, and not even in a funny/ironic sort of way. Burroughs comes off as a bitter, snobby, aging queen, who is way too full of himself. If this becomes a bestseller then it only proves one thing: Burroughs is definitely a better marketer than writer and should go back to advertising. Insulting.(P.S. I only gave this a star because I was required to. If I had a fair choice I'd give it -5)"
4,Great wrap-up a 3-part memoir system - funny and scary both,"As the wrap-up of his Augusten's 3-part memoir series: Running With Scissors, Dry, and Magical Thinking, it was great to see all the stages of his life, and to put the pieces together.His wit can be sharp, but also poignant. Short and sweet, it's a great summer read.Running with Scissors: A MemoirDry: A Memoir,Dry: A Memoir"
4,Best Short Story Collection,"This is the best collection of stories I've read in years. The honesty and glib humor is perfect for anyone needing an uplifting read. I picked up Joan Didion's newly-released ""The Year of Magical Thinking,"" (2005) on the way to a Christmas getaway and bought Augusten Burrough's ""Magical Thinking"" (2004) for the return flight. Such similar titles! The latter was the perfect antidote to the former. Where Ms. Didion bogged me down in sadness and depressing visuals, the story of a family trip to the Vanderbilt house in Newport alone was sufficiently hysterical to renew my enthusiasm for memoir writing. I found some of the stories a bit boring. Also, the parts about his house didn't interest me very much. But, as with everything he writes, Burroughs always pours a little humor into the mix so that even his more mundane pieces light up like Christmas.Bravo. Made me laugh out loud on vacation. Four Stars."
4,Hilarious!,"I have never read anything by Augusten Burroughs before but I think I'll check out some of his other books after reading this one. I have never laughed so hard or so much reading a book. Some of the stuff is just unbelievable but it doesn't matter to me. It was great and, as long as you're open minded, you may love this book too."
1,Terrible Imitation of David Sedaris,"If you want to feel your life seep out of your pores while you waste your time, by all means, read this book. It is the most blatant and yet ineffective imitation of David Sedaris, right down to the common themes (life as a homosexual) and settings (coping with domestic help, having to kill a rodent). The callowness of the author can take your breath away, such as, for example, when he analogizes his baldness to breast cancer, saying (to paraphrase): ""Baldness is to men what breast cancer is to women. While I recognize that baldness is not fatal, it is fatal to one's social life if one is a gay man in New York, and that is just about the same thing."" What a shallow, immature, stupid man.No one should read this book."
3,OK.,"Magical Thinking has some amusing anecdotes and a sharp attention to detail told in an (at times) engaging voice. It's a little heavy on the homosexual relationship whimsy a la ""Ooh my new boyfriend is just soooo understanding and I just loooove all his little quirks because he understands mine."" The story about his cleaning lady is one of the best. I give the book one extra star for the author's one line jab at Tuesday's With Morrie. This is the first book I've read by this author and it's tough not to make a Sedaris comparision. All in all an alright book."
2,Goes back and forth between pathetic and funny. Too much of the former.,"I don't for a second believe that Burroughs is telling the truth about his life -- but I gobbled up his other books anyway. He's funny and there's something endearing about the way he writes -- yes he's gay, and yes that necessarily ""colors"" his worldview -- but talking about a job you hate, a family you loathe, and a partner who amazingly tolerates you are necessarily universal.That said, he lapses here. This isn't as approachable a book and the narrator is isn't so much funny as he is unlikeable. By turns smug and arrogant, too much of this feels self-indulgent. Chafingly, distractingly so."
3,Fair enough,"Magical Thinking is a reasonably good book, but (without having read Running with Scissors) it appears to me that Mr. Burroughs is a paler, and less amusing, pretender to the throne of David Sedaris."
2,Unexpected,"Alright... let say It was not what I was expecting but on the other hand I didn't knew the author and his background.I read this book because first I found it in an old box belonging to the ex-wife of my husband and the cover looked cool and liked the title... Magical Thinking, ok I guess it will be funny little novel thing....wow.... wrong!The first one, about him as a kid (ok, fine but there was no cool point or twist)then in most of the other stories, there's always something about his sexuality, sex this and sex that I didn't expect it... but went for it anyway...still tho, no real twist (except the cab priest).The white mouse one is pure animal cruelty, kinda freaky.So, well, it's not the worst book ever but it's definitely not what the backcover is presenting or the title."
4,Made me laugh,This book made me laugh. He writes stories the way my brain thinks. I like these short stories so much.
2,Just not fun,"I loved ""Running with Scissors"" and ""Dry"", so I expected good things from this book. I was very disappointed.I don't even like Augusten Burroughs as a person anymore. He appears to be a narcissistic, mean spirited, shallow piece of crap. This book wasn't funny like his others. It was disturbing to read about someone Augusten's age acting like a spoiled 3 yr old."
3,My vote has to go to Sedaris,"I don't necessarily like to make comparisons between authors, but when the genre is short, funny, autobiographical stories written by gay men, Sedaris has it all over Burroughs (no pun intended). Magical Thinking is very funny in places, but unfortunatly those places didn't come often enough for me. While Burroughs had me smirking, Sedaris has me spewing my coffee through my nose! The funniest of the bunch was by far ""Debby's Requirements"", any of us who has felt held hostage by a cleaning lady can relate to that one. Overall not a bad way to kill a couple hours, but for my money, no where near as hilarious as Sedaris"
4,read the others first,"It's very easy to get caught up in the Augusten Mania, but to get the most from this book, it's best to attain background by reading his first two memoirs. Magical Thinking is VERY amusing, and I was about to loan it to my mom, but that was before I knew how integral reading Running with Scissors & Dry is in understanding the complexities of his relationships and the basic timeline of the book."
1,Cruelty is not funny,"I have to say it: I was actually enjoying this book until the rat/thing chapter. But reading the descriptive way Burroughs tortures, blinds, and drowns another living creature made me actually sick. I know not everyone has empathy for animals, but even the most seasoned hunter can still recognize the need for humane killing of unwanted pests. Burroughs makes a joke comparing himself to a serial killer. And honestly, he may be one."
2,Not what I expected,"This is my first Augusten book. And I have to admit I really liked the first chapter or two. It reminded me of the very talented David Sedaris. However, Burroughs lacks something Sedaris has - - and that is decency. There's a line you cross to become humorous, and Burroughs has leaped way beyond it, in fact rented a Hummer and completely run over and demolished it. I'm not a ""prude"", I mean I actually was able to enjoy the twisted nature of ""The Tetherballs of Bougainville"" but this came at a cheap trashy expense - which turned out not quite funnny at all. Sadly I gave up on the book early on when he mentioned the encounter with the undertaker and ... well I wont go any further. I wouldnt recommend this book to anyone."
2,"Barely acceptable; nothing like the entertaing, captivating ""Dry"" or ""Running with Scissors""","""Dry"" and ""Running with Scissors"" were fascinating, moving, and frightening memoirs by Augusten Burroughs. Both were worth every minute spent reading them. But ""Magical Thinking"" is just a random collection of experiences that make Augusten Burroughs seem insensitive and cold. Perhaps that was his goal. Few stories in ""Magical Thinking"" are fundamentally entertaining. The ones that are, however, almost (but not quite) make it worth reading. I'd take a pass and read something else if I had my time back."
4,Read the Others,"I don't think I'd recommend this as an introduction to Augusten Burroughs because that might mean someone missing ""Running with Scissors"" which would be a tragedy. This does repeat some of the autobiographical material in Running with Scissors"" and in ""Dry"" but that's not a defect. Go back to ""Sellevision"" if you want something completely different.If you want ot clarify the Anne Sexton references there are two biographies. ""Anne Sexton"" is by Diane Wood Middlebrook. """"Searching for Mercy Street"" (the one Burroughs draws most on) is by her daughter Linda Gray Sexton."
2,No magic or thinking,"Before reading this book, it is important to remember that Burroughs is not Sedaris. While Sedaris' stories are sweet and life-affirming, Burroughs shows just how ugly and cruel the human animal can be. There is nothing ""magical"" about these stories. These stories are the most banal of life's events put under the microscope of a neurotic."
4,Magical Thinking,"It was an ok book. I have read all of his books and this one didn't impress me that much. He can be really weird, and that is part of his charm. This book not so much."
3,Clippings from the Cutting Room Floor?,First let me say that I adore Augusten and have met him at a book signing. Running with Scissors and Dry are two of the funniest books I've ever read. Magical Thinking is a disjointed series of tales that seem to have not made the first two books.I think he maybe running out of memoirs and need to focus on a novel based purely upon his imagination. I hope he still has one. He's a very funny man and David Sedaris can't touch him!
3,"Lighter than Dry, Less Weird than Running With Scissors...","Everyone I know is gobbling up Augusten Burroughs' books. A friend just bought a first-edition, autographed Dry from Augusten's brother. So it's tough to approach one of his books without feeling automatically biased toward him. And why shouldn't I just give myself over to loving him? This guy is fun, fun, fun. His essays in Magical Thinking had me smirking sometimes, nodding with recognition other times, rolling my eyes occasionally. Some of the early ones smack of exaggeration, and so I trod suspiciously through his memories. But that didn't keep me from being entertained. (By the way, the mouse story is ugly and may speak to a psychological disturbance that portends worse events, but didn't we already know that?)"
5,laugh aloud,"this is the book to start with. it will familiarize you with pieces of augusten burrough's life written almost in short story form. it is so funny that i hated to put it down to go to sleep at night. i gave it to everyone i know for christmas and got rave reviews back. if you thought your life was dysfunctional, let your new best friend enter. he is endearing and impossible all in one. when you've finished this book, have 'running with scissors' ready to begin so you won't miss a beat. 'dry' is next- it is the natural progression of the effects of a family run amuck. i'm sure people with a history of addiction will relate much better to burrough's thought processes and life actions than more 'normal' people. i was in awe of his ability to spin humor into every experience. i completely love him and have already placed my order for his next unreleased book. ENJOY!"
5,Awesome product; keeps moisture in colored and flat ironed hair,This product works well with fine color-treated hair that is flat-ironed on a daily basis. It is the only product I have found that keeps my hair soft and looking healthy after being exposed to chemicals and heat styling tools.
1,New formula is terrible,"I loved this product until they changed the formula several months ago. I have thick, frizzy, dry hair, and the original formula conditioned it well and made it soft and manageable. It was the best conditioner I've ever used, and it even apparently won a number of awards. But then they changed it, and I have to use 2-3 times as much for less than half the conditioning effect. It's terrible! It's like trying to condition with thick, stiff water - it does not do the job at all. I'm very disappointed, especially since it's so difficult to find conditioners that work well on my hair. Now I have to try to find something else because I will not continue to spend money on a product that doesn't work anymore. I do not recommend the new formula at all."
5,inexpensive through amazon,Hardware cloth is hardware cloth and about the only thing I can say is that it sure was much cheaper to buy thisstuff through amazon than locally.
3,Good value for the price,"Thin gauge aluminum case that will take little abuse before becoming creased. Cheap three number combination locks that are easily broken. Otherwise well constructed and handsome. Shipped two .22 rifles on an airline with several boxes of ammo and it came through okay probably because it is what it looks like - a rifle case. Couldn't find anything else in the same price range that would have stood up as well. If you are going to frequently or carry ship rifles, you should probably spend more and get a quality case made out of a more damage resistant material."
2,Not a good buy,"Another book with great title, but disappointing content. I hoped for some valuable tips and information, but found basic information that is not necessarily specific to Caribbean cruising."
3,Missed the mark for me,"Missed the mark for me, not much of a page turner. Lots of information though so it definitely has a place on my bookshelf. I doubt that I would take it on a boat. Information about the islands is useful but I think easily duplicated by other titles more valuable on a cruise."
4,Required reading~,"Excellent, easy, informative read. Use it with a variety of other books and you get a great 'picture' of what to expect.One thing that would improve it (or any cruising-info book) would be actual prices when the research was done. This allows a cruiser to know ahead of time what/where is cheaper, and although it can change, it would give a base-line to go from.Any book that has current liquor, internet, food, fuel costs would be ""priceless""."
3,I've already got this book,"I've already got this book, so buying it (again) was dumb. Otherwise, it is an interesting and informative guide."
4,An in your face celebration of being gay.,This is not the typical boy loves boy CD. It is full of funny insights on the life and times of a sexually active gay man.
5,Quiero sader mas del tema,"Esta cancion se me fue dedicada y desde entonces me incanta. Quiero sasber mas del album e tema. La verdad solo he escuchado el tema de ""Romantico Incurable"" una vez pero esta basto para llamar toda mi atencion. Me incantaria volverla a escucharla y obtener ese marabilloso album"
2,A few songs worth having on CD.,"Fair compilation, not as good as a lot of other Power Pop discsIt is worth buying for The Cryers, The Rubinoos, 20/20, The Shoes, Chris Stamey and the dBs early single, the Plimsouls - Zero Hour is great, and who wouldn't want Holly and the Italians - Tell That Girl to Shut Up. If you already have most of these songs from your other records don't bother buying this one since the rest here are easily forgettable.I would get Lost Weekend: A Celebration of Australia instead."
2,Be Careful,"i purchased this product from Desert Paradise, and the film looks boot leg, and the cover art is different than the one pictured online. Ip Man as a wonderful series, but be careful when shopping with Desert Paradise for Ip Man 2."
3,Very Good Movie,"I really enjoyed the first movie about Master Ip.This second follow up is alright, but I still favor the first.Acting by Donnie Yen is also excellent in this second version, but the Martial Arts are not on par with the first."
2,If only I hadn't seen the first one...,"If it were just the usual martial arts movie, the type with the hot choreographed kung fu kick ... scenes and zero story line, than this movie would have been just fine. However, since this is a sequel, a sequel to the great IP MAN, well than you should expect to get flamed for delivering such a pathetic attempt. I can't imagine anyone giving this more than 3 stars especially after seeing the original IP MAN."
4,MARTIAL ARTS/ACTION,"LIKE IP MAN PART 1, IP MAN 2 IS VERY EXCITING AND ENJOYABLE FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY! ANOTHER GREAT PERFORMANCE OF DONNIE YEN! WELL DONE, WELL DONE!!! HERB SIMON."
4,Ip Man 2 Blu-Ray is Very Good,"I first saw this sequel to Ip Man when it was released to the Asian market on DVD even before it hit the US theaters. The action and plot were very good, but the translations for the English sub-titles were sometimes very bad. However, on the Blu-ray version of Ip Man 2 they corrected all the mistakes in the sub-titles of the Asian release and the picture quality and soundtrack are on par with any US releases.I would recommend this to people who liked the first movie, Ip Man, as this was a bit more true to his life story, though they were a lot of exaggerations as well like the scene between Donnie Yen as Ip Man and the English boxer.Wing Chun Kuen rocks the world!"
5,IP Man rocks !!!,I purchased part 1 and 2 together. I was able to watch both movies back to back. Donnie Yen and other characters had the same likeness as Part 1. Hands down great movies.
4,IP Man 2,"Great fighting between Sammo and Yen on table. Villian boxer was cast well. Donnie's movies rarely disappoint, I've been a fan of his since Iron Monkey."
4,Martial arts action at it's best!,"Having been a fan of the first IP Man, I was really excited for the sequel. Even though the premise of the plot is pretty much the same as it is in the first movie... IP Man 2 still delivered a wonderful backstory mixed with superb martial arts action. Even Mr. Sammo Hung had a role, whereas he was simply the action choreographer in the first (I think). This is martial arts action at it's finest. With this movie, however, there was a little bit more wire-work with Donnie Yen's action sequence (especially with Sammo Hung in the scene when they go fist-to-fist). Fortunately the wire-work is very minimal - and the rest of the movie is very, very enjoyable. I took a star simply because the sequel's plot is virtually the same as the first movie; instead of Japanese soldiers, this time Ip Man is faced with defending China's honor against the British. It's still an awesome movie for those fans of the martial arts genre."
5,"Simple, strong and","The movie is more of a reality martial arts movie compared to the 'old school' flying-in-the-air etc movies.The humble disposition of the actor was striking when one also think about the martial arts superiority.I also like the ""'reason"" for his fighting. The normal story line for these types of movie is some young boy stumbles upon a martial arts master; is trained; revenges his family or some love one death. In this movie the reason for the IP Man using his skills is for (it appears) a non self-centred caused - for his family, community and by extension country.I showed the movie to a group of teenage boys showing social change a man may have to go through in life and some of the expectations of him."
4,The sequel to Ip Man,"Being a fan of the first Ip Man of course I had to watch the sequel. Though I found it entertaining and don't regret purchasing it I personally enjoyed the first one more than this sequel. In my humble opinion the story line was more compelling and the drama more real and intense in the first. But the sequel is still very entertaining with plenty of excellent fight scenes.The setting is British-occupied Hong Kong where we find Ip Man trying to open a martial arts school. He must prove himself as a capable master before the corrupt, locally established Masters will permit him to become an instructor. The climax of the movie is Ip Man's match with the brutal Twister, the British heavy-weight boxing champion. East meets West in this final climactic clash."
4,disc came loose in case but worked fine,"disc was loose in case but still worked, movie came quick too maybe 4 days and i live in alaska."
1,This is only for the download version,There was no sound on the video download version and it was a little grainy. The one star was mainly for the time wasted trying to figure out how to turn on the sound.
4,Can anyone say Chinese Rocky IV?,"The story is very simple and had a lot in common with Rocky IV lol. The only reason I gave it such a high score on the amazing job Donnie Yen did on the martial arts choreography. Fight scenes were very well done, and Donnie Yen seems to be an amazing martial artist."
4,Ip Man @,If you love martial arts then this is a must see. The fight scenes are all some in both movies. Be sure to see Ip Man (that's part 1) before you see Part 2. I have seen both movies four times.
3,I really wanted to like this one as much as the first.......,"but sadly, this is not the case. There is a certain mysticism about martial arts that I hold dear, and I do not like it tainted by, of all things, Western Boxing!!! I was enjoying this movie up until these amazing martial artists were pitted against a boxer. Please. I find it absurd that a boxer, I don't care how big, could contend with the style a martial arts expert such as IP Man would pose, especially limited to pure boxing constraints. Perhaps Im taking this too serious, but the way IP Man was built up in the original, virtually untouchable, to be almost beaten by a boxer, ludicrous. That big baboon would not even be able to lay a blow on him when fighting fairly. Oh well, good movie, but kind of ruined by taking me out of the martial arts world and into the boring world of boxing. Does anyone even watch that anymore? It may have been more believable had it been a mixed martial arts/UFC/cage fighter."
4,Ip Man 2 blue ray dvd,"I received the blue ray dvd on time. There were no issues in Australia as our blue ray could read this edition. The price and quality was fantastic. Movie itself was good, although not up to the same standard as Ip Man 1. Definitely worth watching though."
4,Good movie.,"I loved IP Man, awesome movie with an incredible story.When I heard there was a part 2 I had to see it.And...Excellent acting for the most part.Pacing, score, direction were all done well.The movie had me just like the original but then for some reason they wanted to go into ""boxing vs Kung Fu"".This direction really baffled me as it didn't seem to fit with the themes presented in IP Man or the first half of the sequel.The whole boxing vs martial arts seems a tad ridiculious to begin with.I think it has less to do with the method and much more to do with the fighter themselves as to who would win in such a match.Both forms of fighting are beautiful and require great discipline.That's really my only complaint about IP Man 2, the Brits were portrayed as very one dimensional and none of them could act very well either.That point asided IP Man 2 is still an excellent Kung Fu movie that deserves to be seen just for the awesome fight sequences in the first half of the movie.Recommended."
5,better than the first one I think,"I watched the first ip man and It was cool, this second movie I feel is a little more realistic in the action scenes so thats why I like it more, If you liked the first ipman then I recommend watchin this one."
5,In My Top 10!!,A friend suggested this movie for months. Off and on he'd constantly mention it. I finally watched it and had a mini obsession over it. I watched the whole movie or my favorite scenes (particularly when Yen is kicking arse!) for three months. Sammo Hung is fantastic with his choreography! Donnie Yen is amazing at Kung Fu but his portrayal of Yip is breath taking. He incorporates his own touches to the role while conveying such a level of humbleness. Phenomenal.
5,Action Video,"I first saw part 2 while on vacation. I decided to purchase it so I could see it again and again at my leisure. I thoroughly enjoy the martial arts action and the seemingly impossible acrobatics of the various combatants. I generally only purchase movies that I know I can watch multiple times without boredom setting in and only those that can be ""discovered"" and watched by juveniles. This is one of those movies. My daughter called me and said the movies is available on Hulu."
4,"Ip Man 2 - Enjoyable, but not as good as the original.","Cool film. Still great action and choreography. And the final battle is longer than in the first one. But better story in part 1, and part 2 overall is a little slower overall, pace wise. And the main villain's acting in part 2 is WAY overblown - he definitely is ""hamming"" it up for the camera.It was great to see part 2 continue the overall story arc of certain characters from the first one to the second one, and Donnie Yen is a Bad As$! I can't wait to see his next blockbuster film."
1,LAME SEQUEL,"LOVED the first Ip Man movie; everything was near-perfect in that movie. Unfortunately the sequel, Ip Man 2, SUCKS. Bad acting, bad story, lame fights and really horrible super cartoony English voice-overs. Amazing they could do everything so well in the first film and so wrong in the sequel. Even the English voice-overs were great in the first film, especially whoever did the English voice-over for Ip Man's character. Bottom line: Buy IP MAN. But DO NOT buy IP MAN 2.NOTE: There's a third Ip Man movie, but I hear it's really really bad so will not even rent that one."
4,Good movie,"I really enjoyed Ip Man 2. I still think the first one is better, but as a follow-up Ip Man 2 is far better than most follow-ups. The fighting scenes are no doubt amazing. I also like the multi-dimentionalities of most characters. With the exception of the obnoxious English boxer, nobody was simply good or simply bad."
5,Great movie,Great movie. I watch it over and over again. Blue ray is the best. The price is not bad either.
4,Donnie Yen very convincing in portraying a martial arts legend!,"Love IpMan Part 1 but this sequel wasnt as good but still worth the watch. like all hong kong movies, the choreography was phenomenal and compensated for some of the things the movie lacked- for one, the acting- the foreign devils were the worst actors :)"
3,IP Man 2 DVD,"I am very pleased with the condition and the speed of which this order was done.This movie is a great addition to the IP Man set. At first I thought aboutgetting the Blu-ray version, but after seeing the DVD I found it to be morethan good."
2,Bad quality from vendor,"I'm disappointed with this order. It looks like a bootleg copy- The translation is not precise (even in English), the movements are slow and I have a good lcd tv. Wish I could return it But I can't. I will not order from this company again. The movie itself isn't bad but I liked the first Ip Man more. Donnie Yen is incredible."
1,Chinese propaganda,"The blatant Chinese propaganda portraying the white man as being undisciplined, crude ""devils"", rendered this film pretty much as bigoted trash. It also had a predictable, stale, and boring plot."
1,Do Not Waste Your Money!,"This is a bad movie. Poor story line and development. Terrible english Dubbing. Donnie Yen make Bruce Lee look like a Great Actor! The fight scenes are OK but again, he's no Bruce Lee. My only hope is that Suncoast Movie Store will buy it back for $3. Do Not Buy This Movie!!!"
5,awesome movie but kinda goes downhill,I have to give this movie a 5 stars because it's just awesome with all the fighting but after ip man fights the other master it kinda goes downhill with the american boxer. I mean to imagine that someone with boxing gloves would have even a half of a chance against lp man is retarded but the movie is still cool they just should have thought the boxing fighting scenes and plot through more!
3,First was better,"I do think that the first film was better. I thought the English cast was horrible, they were overly dramatic but couldn't act at all. The story was relatively shallow in comparison to the firt film. The bluray is visually stunning though, no complaints on the technical aspect. I just wished we in the US didn't have to wait while they release this series of films so slowly when they have been out for years! WHY?!?"
3,Good but not Great,"If you're a fan of the first installment; you'll like this one, but you won't think that it is better than the first. Good story line and enjoyable movie, but just not as intriguing and engaging as the first."
3,pretty good,"part one is better, but this is a solid and mostly satisfying continuation of the yip/ip man story. don't get caught up in details and biographical truths and you will like it just fine. well shot and well acted."
5,I really enjoy the IP Man movies,"Great acting, great action. Interesting story lines and characters. Just an all around good movie watching experience. Donnie Yen is excellent."
1,Painfully cliche,Just fast forward through the film to the action sequences. The plot is thin and the action is as expected. Nothing new here.
2,Beautiful but.....,This phone is lovely to look at BUT...1. The numbers on the touch pad wore off within 6 months.2. The touchpad completely ceased to function within three years of very light use.( it was a second phone used maybe 1- 4 times a week)3. The receiver cord is EXTREMELY short.
1,Stopped Working After One Day,"Nice looking phone, was initially very pleased with it - but then the touch pad stopped working after one day. I will now have to return it."
1,Stylish but not functional...,"This phone looks great, perfect size & exactly the image I wanted for our dining room telephone nook. Unfortunately I didn't see the reviews (here & elsewhere) before I ordered it online. It's been 3 months now & it no longer rings for incoming calls. Also, it has never worked to call out from the house. You can answer an incoming call fine (if you know there is one from the other house phones ringing...) but when you try to dial out it only dials the first number and then quits. Doesn't matter if I use tone or pulse dialing and I've tried it in 4 different phone jacks now (one of them not even at my house). It is definitely the phone, not my wiring. Disappointing, don't waste your money."
1,Not worth the money. Extremely disapointed,"From the moment I connected the phone it would not work.I could get incoming calls and that is all. The dial tone would work when it felt like it. I had to click the cradle numerous times and just hope for a dial tone.None of the buttons work, and this seemed to be a constant occurence with others whose reviews I read. Save your money and buy another phone. It may be good looking, but buyer beware, because you will be disapointed. I contacted Crosley the maker of this phone, and found out that it would cost half of what I payed for it to get it repaired.,"
5,Great practical guide,"Whenever I buy a book I try to look for ones that have a strong practical aim. This is definitely such a book. It starts off with a fair amount of theory, which is required to fully appreciate it, but then moves into very practical territory with lots of real life problems and situations. This book is one of those A-Z books that ties all the treads together, but spiced up with practical applications in almost every chapter. Definitely worth reading if you need to understand the mechanics of quantitative portfolio optimisation and risk management."
4,Does do the job but,"I found the pesky squirrels would initially pull at the corner of the top and make it loosen and fall to the ground. I have pictures of them inside it munching away BUT once I put it back a couple of times, they left it alone and a year later it is still hanging well and being used by birds! Holds a ton of seed and lasts for a long time before refills. The squirrels cannot figure it out after the initial barrage but it might be more that I did not put it on tight (it takes some effort)."
1,Looks great feeds poorly,"This ""feeder"" is a great looking garden ornament, but, a dysfunctional bird feeder. While it thwarts all squirrel attempts to pillage it also plugs and jams so the birds as well are left starving at the gate. Not recommended."
2,NO Replacement parts,I purchased this bird feeder a couple of years ago and it works well. The squirrels did figure out how to get bird seed when it was hanging on our pergola. So we put it on a pole and it was squirrel proof for a year. The squirrels did mange to jump on top of the feeder and knock the cover off. We would replace it but after we replaced it many times the piece that holds the cover on came off. We can't find the part and PERKY PET DOES NOT SELL REPLACEMENT PARTS! Now it is useless. Very disappointed!
2,"Not proof against big squirrels. Pretty, though.","I'm giving this 2 stars instead of 1 star only because it's still a pretty birdfeeder. That said, the squirrels figured it out in just a few weeks. Here in Ohio we have big red squirrels and how they get the seed is this: they grab the wire hanging bracket with their back feet and hang down the front of the feeder. Then they can reach in, hanging upside down, and get all the seed they want, never putting a foot on the hinged perch. I suppose a smaller squirrel might not be able to reach the seeds with their back feet grabbing the wire, but I'm not sure.This feeder may work if you put it on a post rather than hanging it, and it does come with an additional bit that you can screw on to make it sit on top of a 4""x4"" post. I haven't tried, so I can't say whether they'd figure that one out or not."
1,Good book?,"I see the positive reviews of this book, but I don't understand why. Although I know Bartholomew bear obeys in the end, the way he fights what he is told and says no I do not believe is a good example to our children. They need to learn to obey right away. It is not cute or funny that he says no to his parents when told to do something. And reading it to our kids will make them think it's okay to say no as long as they obey in the end. We all know that things we read to them and let them watch contribute to their thinking. I think it's so much better to teach them to say okay right away. It teaches them to challenge authority, and in a society where the young people have so little respect for authority, this is the last thing they need. I don't mean to read too much into the book, but it seems but the ""nah"" seems to be the recurring theme in the books, and neither I nor my husband liked this book. I seem to be a minority here as far as my opinion, but I am really that far off base?"
5,AMAZING!,"Dark Star is right - This CD has 16 tracks, not 11.This live album sounds amazing, and Utopia's performance is fantastic and incredibly energetic. Utopia is my favorite band ever. I own all 10 of their studio albums, and the live albums and bootlegs. Forget that they haven't performed together in the 8 years preceeding this album... THEY HAVEN'T LOST ANYTHING!!! 'Trapped', in particular is not only the best live recording of the song that exists, but is probably the best live performance of it that I've heard - even better than its performances during the 'wrong planet' and 'adventures' era. I was absolutely stunned...I'm only up to track 4 as I speak, so I can't specifically review the other songs. Either way, I can say with all confidence that any Utopia/Todd fan is seriously missing something if they don't own this album. Get it now, before it becomes obscure or expensive!LONG LIVE UTOPIA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,City In My Head.....,"Unlike most Utopia fans.....I got RATHER tired of Todd/Utopia's bland meanderings after 'Oops Wrong Planet' With the exceptional song or two....I left the fold to pursue other more invigorating music. So when this 'reunion' cd came out....I had mucho trepidation about it! Lo and behold, I was rather surprised that some vintage Utopia was being recreated by the most 'popular' Utopia lineup. Even some of the stuff I couldnt stand was given a rather nicew 'treatmnet.' 'The Ikon' and 'Hiroshima' alone are worth the price of the cd...but then there are some other gems on here inc. 'Trapped' 'Back On The Streets' and 'Fix Your Gauze' In the works and is finalized, is the Utopia II reunion W/ TR Moogy Klingman John Siegler Ralph Shuckett and Kevin Ellman. Hopefully these shows will be documented for public consumption in the near future. If so, it would be a VERY nice pair (with the above) that will document this semi-prog 'mess' which started back all the way in the early 70's!!!!!!!"
5,"If you like to laugh, Maryellen Hooper in ""Fixer-Upper"" is for you!","Maryellen Hooper is one of my favorite comedians. I look forward to her comedy club performances because she is always one of the funniest comics performing.In Fixer-Upper, Maryellen Hooper is very ""family friendly"", conducts funny exchanges with audience members and is an excellent observational comedian. She always has you thinking: ""That story sounds like someone I know!""If you've EVER done any type home improvement (or even just painted a room), or have been frustrated (like I have) shopping at Home Depot, then Fixer-Upper is for you! If you or someone you love only likes to shop at Victoria's Secret, then Fixer-Upper is for you!The only thing better than listening to this CD is seeing Maryellen Hooper perform in person!(Oh yeah, she's also got a blog at stinkyflowers (dot) wordpress (dot) com.)"
2,Not For Carrier Mounting,"I was looking for a taillight that would mount to my carrier. The Cateye TL-LD500-R was advertised as being carrier ready. It was not. The screw to mount it to the carrier was at least 1/4 inch too long and the mounting materials did not come with washers or some other way to fill the gap. I ended up putting the light on my saddle post; however, if I wear a long coat or put my briefcase on the carrier, the light will be hidden. Furthermore, if I had intended to mount it on the saddle post, I would have bought the much brighter Planet Bike taillight."
2,Stupid switch,"Firstly, the light is bright and uses the easier-to-find-and-replace AAA batteries. But 'replace' is the operative word here. The very exposed and touchy power button was an awful idea. I can't tell you how many times I've opened my backpack or duffel bag to find my gear illuminated with a creepy red glow. A slider or switch would have been much simpler. Other than that it's a really good light, but the backpack-bump-parity-counting feature is unnecessary and frustrating."
5,"Excellent, Of Course","The seventeenth in O'Brian's brilliant twenty-volume nautical series finds Captain Jack Aubrey and sidekick Stephen Maturin returning from a circumnavigation voyage that took up the previous four volumes. The first part of the book is taken up with their shore visits, something we haven't seen in several volumes. These turn out to be bittersweet, as Sophie and Jack have a spat and Stephen's home life is even more confused. When they finally set to sea, Jack is the commodore of a squadron with a double-mission: to interdict the slave trade off the African coast and then to confront one of Napoleon's invasion fleets.As always, O'Brian serves up nautical detail, a wry sense of humor, deeply developed characters, and minimalist prose. ""The Commodore"", like the first sixteen volumes in this series, is simply excellent."
3,Not the Best,"This is not the best of the Aubrey/Maturin novels, though O'Brien's writing is as fine as ever. Almost all of the action involves the characters' personal lives and takes place on shore; the climactic naval battle, about which one is teased until the last few pages, is brief and perfunctory. Fans of the series will have to read this; others can sample its better examples (e.g., Master and Commander)."
5,Great series!,Must-read. The entire series is excellent. You will grow to care about the characters. I recommend buying the entire set.
2,Disappointed,"I am not an experienced GoLive user, so I approached this book as a beginner. At first glance, it covers all the basic topics necessary to get to know the program. But I found CONSTANT omissions of steps in the descriptions of processes. Sometimes I fooled around and discovered the missing step, and sometimes I felt like the fool when I couldn't replicate the steps with the intended result. I've used other books in the series, like LiveMotion 2 in 24 Hours, which I found not only well written, but containing thoroughly checked exercises. The book is a decent introduction as long as you do not expect the step-by-step to be accurate. To me, this smacks of sloppiness on the part of the authors."
5,Foormula 405 Face/Cleansing lotion,"The Formula 405 Soapless Cleansing lotion has been the best product to clean my face from make-up and oil, especially when used w/ a buff-puff. I have used it for over 30 years. It helped me get over acme when I was younger. It cleans your pours without drying your skin, as soap does. I use it first thing in the morning and also before going to bed at night. I have not had soap on my face for over 30 years and am always complimented for how good and vibrant and young I look."
5,Soapless Cleanser,I love this soapless cleanser as a facial scrub. I am 61 years old and have dry skin so I am always looking for a product that doesn't dry but cleans thoroughly. Ths product doesn't have fancy packaging but the product is better than those with all the expensive advertising. A small amount goes a long way and your skin will look great.
5,Russian Translation Office for Business Persons on CD-ROM,"It on my supervisings the largest and modern selection of the E-R-E dictionaries on business : economy, jurisprudence, business correspondence etc. It is very convenient, that in a complete set of delivery is present CD with the program computer-translator and CD with the electronic dictionaries Polyglossum"
5,ive never seen thses matches plus anything with HBK is great,i loved this movie im a huge HBK fan so anything with him has to be good. some of the matches arent plyed in there entirety but i still enjoyed it. If you love shawn i recommend this it takes place in 1995 to early 1996 so before he won the title. there is a movie called boyhood dream with his reign as champion that one comes after this one. i liked it there were matches i hadnt seen before and there were a few i had seen. i loved every minuet best birthday present ever. ill leave it up to others though. If you love wrestling and HBK id watch it.
2,He's a one hit wonder,"As a poet, Jim Carroll is fabulous. His music is primarily his poetry put in 4/4 time. The problem is that format places every song soundin the same.""People who died"" is a fantastic, gritty, punch-in-the-face punk rock song. It is everything punk showuld aspire to do.Unfortunately, that song never comes close to being equaled and the rest on this ""best of"" are inferior, all sound the same songs.I guess that's what happens when you are not a musician and stroll into unfamilar territory."
3,The stars are for the effort,"I truly love Jim Carroll's writing and I regret to say that his music is not half as powerful as his poetry. ""People Who Died"" is the strongest song and if you're expecting the rest of the album to be like that... well sorry."
4,Long live Jim Carroll,I bought Catholic Boy back in the day and at some point it disappeared from my record collection. Watched The Basketball Diaries a couple of weeks ago and realized that I really missed these songs. Jim was a really multi talented guy and these songs are just great punk poetry.
3,Nice for a little kid,"My son is 9 and may be too old for this. The ""trick"" is kind of obvious... I think people have to pretend they're surprised... My son is really into magic tricks and is actually quite good at preforming them! But this hanky trick is just ok..."
5,This is old school Magic !,"This is as simple as it gets, Basically self working. Recommended for any age 6 years old and up. works smoothly and does what is expected, Presto !"
4,Decent trick,"My four-year-old son likes this trick and it was very easy for him to learn. When you change the scarves from one color to the other, you can still see the tip of the previous color. But for a little one, it's great."
3,color changing scarf,This is a magic trick that I had when I was a little boy. Its great if you like magic....
3,"Simple, But Fun","This is such a simple trick! What I like about it is there are different ways to do the trick and even though the hankies are small and kind of delicate, they hold up very well. But you have to be careful with them and take care of them or they won't last. When not in use, they should be stored so they won't start looking ""ratty""."
3,good buy but...........,"this is a very cute gimmick.although its cute its not very good quality, especially with the seams of the fabric.thats why it was 3.5$.....i bought this item 2 weeks ago and already it ripped"
4,Pretty Good,"Creates a good illusion if done well but is not good quality. The second day I had this the ring fell off. But, I hand sewed it back on easily and is now great. Fools most as long as you conceal the ring and the little amounnt of fabric hanging out. I would recommend it!"
2,First impressions not always the best,"I got the first chapter for this book from a reading club, and ran to the library to check it out. I am so glad that I did not spend money on this book. After I started reading, I got to a point where I thought ENOUGH with the conflict. There is only so much antagonism that one book can take, and this one over does it big time. I mean, between the sister, the ex-wife, Seamus, and her husband, how much more can the woman take? The ending seemed too pat after putting that much animosity in the plot, and left me feeling like I did not spend my time wisely. I was looking forward to the next 2 books in the trilogy, but am now not so sure."
2,Too much stress,"I purchased this book because of the information on the back. I have put this book down twice thinking I give up. There is too much time wasted between Jon and Belinda. Lil's sister is an unnecessary character. She delivers a book and comes back engaged? The next day, that is over, Jon has changed his mind and asked Lil. He should have asked Lil and the story continue, without throwing her sister in the middle. I do not know if I can finish this book.I have read over 200 books this year so I am familiar with well written books. This one needed more work"
5,Great Series.,"I received Book 1 as a gift and thought or well. Then I read it and purchased all the others. I anxiously await the next book. It has been about 4 years now and on Jerri's web page she tells why it has been so long. This book will be worth waiting for. As you read, you laugh, then you cry, and laugh some more. I think that every woman can relate to something in all of these book. Well worth the purchase."
3,"Good story, easy reading, recommend it","This book was an easy read, the story was a little unbelievable in places but overall I would recommend this book. It keeps you interested throughout and even though you think you can predict the ending, a few things pop up that you don't expect. I think it got a little out of hand towards the end, but by that time I wanted to see how it would end so I kept reading."
4,From theory to practice,"Understandable, practical book on how societal culture influence human behaviour and how this knowledge can be (and already is) applicated in various cross-cultural training programmes. The author combines the theory with examples from every-day life, so that the book can be understood by non-academic population."
4,Villeroy and Boch French Garden tray,"There are plastic trays that match several V&B; dinnerware patterns, and they're lovely. Having handles is a nice touch. Unfortunately, I haven't found anyone on the Internet who will send them directly to Canada. You need a US resident who will accept your order and forward it to you. Because of their size, they're expensive to mail.Although these trays are lovely, and despite the fact that they're plastic, they are brittle and break/crack/chip easily if dropped on a hard floor. This happened to my mother. So treat them as if they are porcelain or china."
4,Cute and versatile,"I just got this mirror and took it out of the box for my son to play with during tummy time. I read the reviews on it and decided on this one because of the wedge (so I wouldn't have to prop it up) and the ability to attach it to the crib or various other places. I also read that there's no distortion so I thought it would be great. I guess I must not understand what that means because I think the mirror still kinda distorts images! But for a safety mirror, I guess it's good enough. My son enjoyed looking at it and he's only 10 weeks old.I read that someone didn't get the bright orange mirror that's in the main picture on this page, and received the purple one instead. I ordered it anyways keeping that in mind, but hoping to get the orange one still. I ended up receiving the purple one. Kind of disappointed, but the backside of the purple is very pretty.Overall, it's a nice safety mirror."
5,Great Mirror,My daughter loves this mirror. With the back flap you can stand it up on the ground to any postition.
2,Slightly disappointed,"The mirror I got sent was one with a purple frame, not the one on the main picture which has an orange frame. I would have preferred the orange colored mirror frame but still kept it. However, I was very disappointed of the quality of the mirror. It is not at all that clear as it is shown on the product page of Amazon. My guess is that the product was changed and the customers who got the orange framed mirror were lucky, those who got the purple framed mirror were not."
3,Not as pleased as expected,The toy is cute like all Lamaze toys but the mirror - which is the most important part of it - is not like a regular mirror.Other reviews said the mirror is great but I disagree.
2,Very Distorted,"I read the recent reviews warning that the mirror is horribly distorted, but I thought perhaps people had unrealistic expectations for a safety mirror. I wish I had listened to the reviews because this product is bad, even for a safety mirror. The distortion is so severe that I can't look at it without hurting my eyes. The reason I gave this product two stars, rather than one, is that the design is cute and a wedge is a great idea for tummy time."
1,"nice toy, but does not last long","Great little toy for the young ones - mine loved it! However, it did not take much abuse and the seam broke after a few months with the stuffing coming out. So beware!"
2,Very disappointed in this mirror...,"I wanted to like this mirror, but the fact that it came to me looking like some other baby already had played with it for 6 months makes me a little upset! It's all scratched up! Also, it's smaller then it looks in the picture....not impressed, but the hubby is making me keep it for our 7 month old daughter."
3,ok product,"This is a great idea - the wedge and mirror are 2 separate parts. The mirror is attached via velcro straps and can be removed. It's used for tummy time, but when baby is on her tummy, she's at an angle that is too low to look at herself because the mirror is angles towards the ceiling. You can lift the mirror and place it elsewhere and make it so she can see herself, but then the image is altered. It's one of those weird mirrors that easily changed the reflection if not perfectly straight. This is a top rated brand, and it's good for what it is. Mine came exactly as pictured even though the caption said 'colors may vary'"
5,Great toy for newborn to toddler age,"I bought this for my son when he was born. It was great to use for tummy time. When he was learning to sit up, I would put this on his lap and he LOVED looking at himself and enjoyed touching his reflection in the mirror. I also had him feel all of the colorful, soft, and textured fabrics the mirror is made out of. This is a ""safer"" toy for babies to use as it is soft and they cant get hurt. The mirror is flexible plastic -not the clearest thing in the world -but it does the job. As far as cleaning this toy -I just used dreft wipes -cleans up nicely.As he got older, he used this mirror while sitting in his high chair. He is now almost 14 months old, and still enjoys the mirror.I just ordered this mirror as part of a baby shower gift for a friend. She cant wait to use it!"
5,Moisturizer,I bought this along with the Soapless cleanser and love both of them. It is light enough to wear under makeup but heavy enough to use as a night cream. I have used many products on the market and rate this one as #1.
3,Typical HK,"Supposed to be a classic. It's not all bad, but is highly predictable and overdramatic. If you can except it for what it is, it does what it means to."
1,A real stinker!!!,"I'm not sure what the other reviewers saw in this film. From the overly dramatic soundtrack (that virtually beats you into submission and overstates what's happening in the movie) to the slow script, to the predictable ending, this was a real stinker. Being a die hard HK movie buff I had to fight my desire to turn this off mid way through the movie. And this coming from an Andy Lau fan. I did enjoy the main characters and the acting from them was pretty good. Having said that, every thing else about the movie stunk. Unless you like bloody noses (the bloody nose of all movie bloody noses) don't waste your money on this one."
1,Wrong edition,"I bought this book, and the accompanying ArtNotes, as a textbook. It is, however, an old edition of the book that has been superseded. The new edition - the one assigned for the course - is the 9th edition, not the 8th. If you're buying this book for your personal use, fine, but if it is for coursework, don't. I am quite disappointed in Amazon. Next time, I buy at the college bookstore. A rating is required. My rating is not of the book, but of Amazon's performance."
1,not happy,I orderd this book on July 11 for my class that started that same week. My class ended on August 8 and I never received the book. The seller never contacted me to give me the tracking number. I waited an waited for my book and I never got it. I contacted the seller when I didn't received my book and a day later I got my money back.
4,Prebles' Artforms book,"Book was in good condition, good pricehowever I bought the wrong edition.I don't remember if the edition number was posted.however, it will do.thanks"
5,Carter Hall please give us more!,"Carter Hall touched my heart with a full range of emotions. He has expressed the obvious which so many of us never see, with such depth that one can only marvel at what they are reading. I consider this work a true treasure and reach for it many times during my day, each time I gain a new perspective, a new feeling, a new emotion. Thank you Carter Hall, I have looked for more of your work, please write more, I am hungry for your words."
5,Harrison Ford double feature,I liked Air Force One but have never seen In The Line of Fire so can't comment on that one. This is a gift for one of my dils but she is. Harrison Ford fan so Im sure she will be happy.
3,"Blackfoot is still good, but Ricky Medlocke is missed.","As a longtime Blackfoot fan, I was excited to get this CD/DVD combo. I just watched the DVD and the production and sound is good. The Band plays very well, it is just not the same without Ricky.It is worth the price though to see Charlie Hargrett and Greg T. Walker having a great time and playing better than ever. Had they reunited with Ricky, Im sure I would give it 5 stars"
3,NO RICKY BUT STILL ROCKIN',"Ricky was, is the best front man in all of rock -n -roll. the best. To bad he is not allowed the stretch his rock n roll wings in lynyrd skynyrd. THIS CD DVD COMBO IS STILL REALLY GOOD. THE sound could be better. but the picture quality of the dvd is great!!! DO NOT miss the new molly hatchet cd, dvd combo. flirtin with disaster live. it is great. If you are a fan of southern rock, both of these cd, dvd combos are a must buy."
1,WARNING..........,Ricky Medlocke is not on the cd or the dvd of this concert. Avoid at all cost. You have been warned.
5,"If you grew up in the early 70's, this is a MUST HAVE cd!!","Lobo was one of my favorite singers. Although he didn't last as long as some of the other greats of the 70's, his songs have stayed in my heart since those days. I haven't ever been able to find any of his recordings until now, and it's such a treat to be able to hear them again. I also have the ""Best of Lobo"" on the ""Curb"" label, but it was a little disappointing because of the decidedly disco flavor he adds to the album. When you buy a ""best of"" cd, you want the REAL stuff! Boy, does this take me back."
3,Another Missing Song...,"In addition to the aforementioned ""Midnight Ghost"" (which I've actually never heard), there is another great track missing from this set: the upbeat, disco-tinged ""Where Were You When I Was Falling In Love?"" from the Summer of 1979. Since that happens to be my favorite Lobo song, I gave the Rhino set only 3 stars and chose the 1990 WEA/Atlantic 'Greatest Hits' compilation instead. Though that set has fewer songs, all the ones I really like are there."
3,love him for what he is,"Sometimes characterized as a one hit wonder, Lobo actually accumulated 8 top forty hits during the 70's. While his voice is a bit thin he covers for it with better than average lyrics, which vascillate between recalling wistful memories and lamenting melancholy relationships. His popular style of country-pop mixed lovely acoustic guitars with fat basslines, sunny background singers and a touch of strings. This Rhino disc is superior to the Curb edition ... for me the price increase alone is justified by the wonderful liner notes and vastly superior song selection. Lobo's self depreciating quotes in the booklet add a greater understanding behind the man who wrote the fantastic ""It Sure Took a Long, Long Time"""
4,A good find,"I've been a Lobo fan ever since the mid 1970's (I often wonder what ever happened to him). As others have stated, there are two ""Best of Lobo"" albums. This one (Rhino) focuses on his work form the earlier part of the 70's, while the other (Curb) is mainly from the later part of the decade. But what the hell - at these great prices, I bought them both. Only 3 songs (his 3 biggest hits: ""Me and You And A Dog Named Boo"", ""I'd Love You to Want Me"" & ""Don't Expect Me To Be Your Friend"") are duplicated on both albums.What makes this one so great is that it contains my 2 all-time favorite albums cuts of his: ""Rock And Roll Days"" & ""Goodbye Is Just Another Word"" from his ""Calumet"" album. I wish all of his original albums were made into CD's. He really put out some great work on them back then, and the public is being robbed by not being able to enjoy them today."
2,NOT ORIGINALS,"ONLY ""WHERE WERE YOU..."" IS THE ORIGINAL RECORDING, THE OTHER HITS ARE NEW RECORDINGS, GO FOR ""GREATEST HITS"" FROM CURB RECORDS, THAT`S THE BEST CHOICE."
4,Travel toy great for small spaces,"When we travled from the West Coast to the South we needed some easy travel toys for our 4 yr old daughter. While this should be played with another adult, she found it to be fun and entertaining. Bumpy rides in the car are not so good for this toy, better for the hotel room or stationary places. The pieces can get bumped out of their spaces pretty easily. Otherwise, great toy for a great price."
4,As described,The only problem with this item in my opinion is that it has small pieces easily lost. I thought it was all contained for travel.
2,Not what I expected,This wasn't exactly what I expected. It said travel (duh). I did see that but I didn't expect for it to be so little. I really purchased this for my classroom and I couldn't use it because it was for a 4th grade. They will break this small game up in no time. I really didn't like the size and the quality of the game. Eventhough it was really more my fault because I didn't take the time to get the specifications of the game.
2,Much Less Real Wood!,"I bought a set of these when they first started reissuing the 'real wood' Tinker Toys about 5 or 10 years ago. That set also had 66 pieces, and they were mainly wood with only 4 plastic pieces (the green windmill fans). The current set is NOT THE SAME as the one I bought 5 or 10 years ago; the current set has 66 pieces, but 24 of them are plastic pieces!!! In other words, six times as much plastic! They should label it ""SOME REAL WOOD PIECES."" Disappointing, and much less ""the classic"" than it used to be. The plastic Tinker Toys break much easier; some new sets are ALL plastic, and I avoid them."
1,Disappointed!,"My kids get super frustrated because the pegs fall out of the holes. This would be a great toy if they stayed together properly. My son especially wants to play with these, but every time he tries, he gets frustrated with them."
2,No Instructions = Frustrated,"I bought a set of tinkertoys for my 6 year old son. Unfortunately, since there are no detailed, step by step isntructions, we found it too frustrating to reproduce some of the elaborate creations pictured on the container. We also broke several pieces in the first few hours. Maybe I'm just spoiled with K'Nex, and the very detailed instructions they come with. Maybe for some kids who just want to use their imagination to build their own creations, this would be a good toy. My son really wanted to build the creations pictured on the container, so this toy did not work for us, so we returned it."
1,the manual is awful,I purchased Ideal Frontier Logs and the picture manual is horrible and difficult to undertsand.For that reason I'm returning it.
4,Tinkertoys,Great classic gift. This is a small starter set. I was dissappointed to find so much plastic in a tinkertoys set.
1,Larger than the standard size,This set is larger than the standard set. I ordered them from Amazon to add to a standard set that I already have but they are too big to work with that other set. You can't tell the size until you open the box and then it is too late to return them!
5,Toy that has stood the test of time,"Tinkertoys have been around for many years. I played with them as a child years ago..My children played with them and now my grandchildren. This toy is simple, has no breakable parts and allows children to use their imagination. Both girls and boys enjoy builing with tinkertoys.When I decided to get this toy for my granddaughter I went to amazon. I easily found it at a reasonable price, ordered it and it was delivered within a week."
2,Extra TinkerToy parts,"I added this set to my Grandkids collection, and the parts were flimsy and the holes too big for their other pieces. We were disappointed."
2,Very Poor Quality,"I purchased the wooden version of this toy over the plastic version because I thought the wooden would be more durable. I cannot speak for the plastic set, but the wooden set is certainly not made the way it was when I was a child.I bought this for a Christmas present, and a month later many of the parts are damaged.Many of the ends of the rods have cracked off. A few rods broke when I was playing with my two daughters, so I know the breakage occured during average and gentle play.I was very disapointed in the overall quality. This is another classic toy that is now being produced overseas, and is not the toy it once was."
3,More for nostalgic grown ups than for today's kids,"I reckon in this day and age, Tinkertoys are bought more to satisfy the purchaser's nostalgia than to give today's kids something to get excited about. Too few pieces cut short kids imaginative building sessions. (To be fair, Lego is guilty of this too.) Loose fitting connections inevitably lead to creations that fall apart and cannot really be played with. How fun is that? And stick ends that break far too easily mean your child may be able to build that ""working elevator"" that uses all the sticks only once! I guess you could buy a second set to get replacement parts and spares, but I don't see the point."
2,broken pieces,I purchased a tinkertoy set for my grandaughter for Christmas. After only a half hour of play we had 3 broken pieces. By the next day we had six. This was not rough or unsupervised play. I contacted Hasbro and they will replace the 6 pieces. What a disappointment. They must not be using the same wood to make the most recent sets.
1,Junk,"I have order many items from amazon.com, but this calculator I received is going to be my last order from this website."
3,Pistol size should be considered,"I am able to fit 3 small pistols which are CCW sized in this box easily with mags. I could try to fit 4, but why since it will just make them rub in the box. The capacity may be correct if you are using derringers in the box. I would say it will fit 2 45's with mags comfortably, but I don't have any that size. Locks work, box is functional and looks good. Still a deal."
1,locks didn't work,So-So packaging - arrived with slight damage. Combination locks didn't work - the locks are made VERY poorly considering the price.
2,Guide Gear Pistol Case,"The case itself is sturdy and does what it is designed for. However, the locks on this case are cheaply made and leave much to be desired. Too bad, with better locks this would be a 5 star case."
5,The best way to see NYC,"In Sept - Oct 2011, my wife and I, spent some 10 days walking streets of Manhattan and enjoyed it very much. But the balloon view or helicopter view that you get to see in this DVD is fantastic. It is highly professional and extremely enjoyable. One can never see NYC like this on his own. We have been to most countries in the world and we do not hesitate to give 5 star to this DVD and the persons behind it. The quality of picture as well as direction of movies is absolutely top class. Do see before you go to NYC. Amit Shah (India)"
4,Excellent!,"buy this dvd, music videos are excellent, specially Babylon A.D. Quite disturbing, actually...but this translates as good. I would buy PanDamonAeon along with this. The only reason it only gets 4 stars is that i wish it was longer..."
5,"CRADLE RULES!!! A SHORT BUT "" BITTERSWEET"" DVD!!!!!","WOW!! This little Gem should definately NOT be missed by Cradle Of Filth fans!!! The video for: ""Babylon A.D."" and ""Mannequin"" are reason enough to purchase this DVD, but the extras you get are really AWSOME too!! Unlike the DVD's of: ""Heavy Left Handed and Candid"" and ""PanDaemonAeon"" this is packaged in a CD jewel case(NOT the traditional ""Clamshell"") which is GREAT because you can put it among the REST of your Cradle Of Filth CD collection!!! and fits perfectly in ALL CD size cases!! GREAT DVD from A GREAT BAND!! Don't hesitate to pick this one up!! I really DON'T think you will be Dissapointed!!! I can't wait to see what Cradle puts out next!!!(PS:)Be sure to pick up: ""Heavy Left Handed and Candid"" and ""PanDaemonAeon"" for More GREAT Filth videos and PLENTY of extras!!!LONG LIVE METAL!! and KEEP SPREADING THE FILTH!!!!"
5,Great DVD!!!,This DVD is awesome. Many kick @$$ features and the making of the Mannequin video. Recommended to all!!!
4,Lovely book,"Thoroughly recommended. My kids have read it from cover to cover and have had me read it to them until I can ""read"" it to them from memory."
2,A disappointment,"This book offers advice on uncluttering your home but it it simplistic and focuses on superficial ""uncluttering"" rather than long-term solutions. I have been reading Cheryl Mendelson's ""Home Comforts"" which is fabulous. I thought this book might have something to add but it doesn't. Save your money."
1,lame,"This book was super over simplified. I hated the fact that the author gives advice like, "" Find boxes to organize things in your basement or attic."" Duh?!...I have not problem storing crap in boxes as it gets it out of my way...but stuff is still disorganized. Or advice like, "" Buy a filing cabinet to store loose papers."" Really? I guess I need a book with more specif ideas and details."
5,better for windows.,"I had this game for PS, but it much better with a mouse.Wish there was a GP2 for windows as well."
4,pleasin' for a reason,"Very nice tribute to the music of the late, great Gram Parsons by an eclectic bunch of artists. The only ""nails on the chalkboard"" moment for me is when Victoria Williams sings. I've never figured out the appeal of her music, and she doesn't change my opinion here. Other than that track, most everything else is very skillfully and lovingly performed. It may not please the diehard Parsons fans, but I think this is a good introduction to his music for those who may not be familiar with his solo work or the stuff he did with the Flying Burrito Brothers."
4,Vent lid,Product was fine it was just the wrong one. My fault didn't pay close enough attention. I will probably will sell it a yard sale.
2,Doesn't fit.,"I bought this cover for my cargo trailer which needed a new one. Line 3 of the description suggests it will fit all 14x14 vents. It's a cargo trailer and I have no idea what model vent it might have. Does anyone? Upon further investigation I found that I more than likely need unit #40158 instead of #40152. Since it isn't pricey enough to return, perhaps I can make a lamp out of it. My fault though, I should have been more diligent in my search. If you need one of these covers, make sure you get the right hinge type."
2,"Repeating, repeating and repeating.","The story of the book is about two twins that were separated in the hospital, why or how it doesn't really matters, it also doesn't really matters if they were twins, cousins or friends, when they find out that they were brothers you will be so bore that you will don't care.The two biographies are the same but in different schools, how many campaigns could anyone write in a book? three, four, five? What happened with JA? How many girls will be pregnant in the last year of college? All of them? They go to college just to have sex? Come on Mr. Archer, this is your first book?I will not say anything about the end because I don't have enough words to say it.If you want to read a book of twins read The Hancock Boys by Thomas William Simpson"
2,Utter [baloney],"Such contrived disasters befall both Fletch and Gnat's families in a single one dimentional novel that only alien abductions and resurrection scenerios and perhaps a special guest appearance by Elvis were omitted by the author.Final word: the last time I looked, the 35th president's face does not appear on an American silver dollar. A 25 cent piece would have been appropriate. Just skip it."
2,Barely 2 stars,"I have read all the other reviews which I agree with, but what REALLY annoyed me was the constant use of the word ""as"", instead of ""since"", ""because""or even a different sentence construction. Did he have a computer program do the actual writing ? I checked how often Archer used subject, verb, comma and ""as"". It was almost every other page - it was so glaring I had trouble reading, and THAT'S disregarding the idiot plot. I now wonder why I even gave it 2 stars."
4,Sons of Fortune,"I am a fan of Jeffrey Archer and usually find his books very compelling and entertaining. Was a bit surprised to find out that Son of Fortune is the first in a trilogy and that the other two books hadn't been written yet. I am, however, waiting avidly for the next book. I found the story riverting with believable characters and story line."
1,"No essence, no plot, boring story that drags on and on...","First time I read an Archer book, after my friend recommended him, so I began reading as it promised to have a good plot, about two twin brothers separated at birth.But the story drags on and on, there is literally pages and pages of it, you keep hoping that soon you will arrive at the exciting part, but never happens, there is no story in my opinion. If anything exciting does happen, it soon resolves itself with a GOOD outcome! What??In the end I got so bored waiting to read interesting stuff, I didn't even finish the book, I read about 3 quarters then abandoned it.Im afraid I will not be buying another Jeffrey Archer book, even though other might be better.Sorry..."
1,Who wrote this nonsense?,"Being a fan of Mr. Archer's from way back, I was delighted to see that he was back on track and making good use of his confinement. Boy, was I wrong! This novel reads like Danielle Steel wrote it- full of trite phrases and hokey dialogue that only shows that Mr. Archer must not be conversing a great deal lately. Also, the time frames do not match up with the characters: if they are twins, Nat goes to Vietnam when he is in his first year of college, (18) stays 2 years and comes back when he is 19? Simultaneously, his ""twin"" is now at Yale Law? Huh?The worst part of the book is the ending- (stop here if you don't want to know...)a rival reveals secrets that lead Nat's talented and sensitive son to suicide (even though it had NOTHING to do with him..) and the two brothers find themselves at last- only to agree never to acknowledge each other. Neither of these incidents stop them from campaigning for governor..."
4,"Far fetched idea, but still a good story","It's interesting reading the other reviews of this book. For most of Archer's books, readers are in general agreement in their reviews. Not this one! I for one, liked it very much. I agree that the whole premise that the story is based on, the way the twins are separated at birth, is a little far-fetched, but Archer built a great story on that!"
1,not worth a read,"i've always liked Archer's books-----but this one was a big let down. i can't believe that the same author wrote books like NOT A PENNY LESS NOT A PENNY MORE & SHALL WE TELL THE PRESIDENT. the auhtor borrows heavily from his previous books--be it Nat reffering to paintings as mistresses(short story),or his son hanging himself on finding out that his grandmotherwas a prostitute(similar to daniels death in AS THE CROW FLIES) or even the love story of the twins parents-which is very similar to the short story AN OLD LOVE. this book is a waste of time and money-both which may be used to buy and read better stuff."
3,Leaving me empty,Jeffrey Archer has written many good books. However this one seem to fall flat. The ending was a great disappointment. This theme has been created several times. the text did not flow as in his previosly written books.
5,Great Book!,Really enjoyed this book! Great characters and interesting plots. Only problem is keeping characters straight at first. Recommend this one.
4,Interesting read,"I found this book to be quite interesting, the interaction of two families and the way they were brought together. It started from birth and went through to adulthood so covered a wide range of events."
2,ENDS WITH A WIMPER,"Premise was good and details sharp. However, I got to the end and could not believe what a let down it was."
1,I want my money back!!!,"Characters with no characters. Too formulaic, cliche ridden and also unfinished. Can I get my time back too?"
4,Can someone solve me the ending ?,"Ive read the book , but i didnt understood the ending of it , and ive already returned the book so someone can please email me to the address yanir0x@hotmail.co.il , to solve me the ending issue (Who won ? and why ? ? ?) .thank u."
3,"Good, a poor mans Kane & Able....","Archer is a great writer and the way the novel went back and forth reminded me of his great novel, Kane & Able. This was good, but far from great. A nice story without many twists."
3,Annoying factual errors,"I started this book marveling that a British author would be able to get so much of the American background right. Soon I was groaning in incredulity that an American editor didn't catch his mistakes. #1: He presents Yale College as coed at a time when it was not. #2: He presents the governorship as a higher position than representing a state as senator, when it's actually the opposite. #3: He says a certain town in Connecticut was the last in the country to have paper ballots in a certain year, when I know for a fact that I voted on paper ballots several years later than that in Massachusetts. His courtroom scenes are not very realistic, either. Too bad as Archer can be a whopping good storyteller."
3,Archer's creativity is fading out,"For those who have read ""Kane & Abel"" and ""As the Crow Flies"" -five star novels-it'll be very disappointing to find repetitive elements of these two books in ""Sons of Fortune"" (e.g., the hero's child suicide and heros' lifelong friends). The plot is weak and utterly unrealistic and the characters are plainly dull, but Archer still manages to make it readable and even enjoyable by means of his unique narrative flair. Also a bit disappointing is the fact that Archer seems to be even more fed up of Britain as he chose to develop the novel again in an American setting, just as he did with ""The Eleventh Commandment"". I'm still an Archer's fan, therefore I would like him to write another masterpiece based on an up-to-date theme, such as Mr Blair adventures in the UK or the Bush-Gore confrontation to the White House."
2,skimmed through much of it,"I had read only one Archer book previously (Kane & Abel) which many reviewers agree is his finest. This one didn't compare. It started out pretty well, but my attention lagged at parts, and the ending was disappointing. I found the suicide of Nat's son pointless. Lucy's relationship with George could have been interesting, but she ends up just saying he's only a friend and gets an abortion. The scene big revelation at the end was a letdown. Many reviewers have pointed out inaccuracies, and I'll mention one no one else has: Archer makes the character of Su Ling half Korean. He correctly points out that Koreans are different than Chinese and Japanese, but obviously did not research authentic Korean names. The names he gives to Korean characters sound more like Chinese. It would have been very simple to look up a few real Korean names. This is just something that annoyed me."
3,archer-not at his best,"Born in Hartford, the twins from HeavenSeparated at birth, it twisted their faithSuccess was the only thing they had ever metOne banker, anohter lawyer, but the secret still unmentionedWill they ever meet or will they never see each other like a two sides of a coin?Nobody can predict.Because they are the sons of fortune. Sons of fortuneWell, this poem should sum up the whole book.. all of archer's books have been great and they have always given me satisfaction and pleasure.. so i immediately read the book after it came out.. its a very good book consisting of a magnificent plot and intense drama between the twins.. you always have this ironic question in your mind.. will they ever meet each other?the book has everything to deliver but this book is definetly not a platinum.. coz of its dissapointing ending.. its more like a hollywood movie that comes out these days"
1,His worst,"This improbable (more like impossible) story is so filled with gaps and poor research it would be laughable even from a first time author. Mr. Archer seems to have no knowledge of how the draft lottery worked (selected by birthdate) as one twin recieves a notice yet the other doesn't, nor how deferements worked. He never bothered to find out the difference between a Warrant Officer and a Commissioned Officer in the US military. He mish mash of time has a college junior starting law school. Then, of course, is his complete ignorance of how either primary elections or a general elaction for Governor works. Perhaps Mr. Archer should invest some of his royalties in a researcher to get at least some of the details right. Other then that the charaters are cardboard and the dialogue mostly childish. This book is a severe disappointment even by Mr. Archer's standards."
2,Archer misses the mark,"Jeffrey Archer's recent legal troubles are well known. Perhaps he needed a quick bestseller to finance his ongoing appeals. That can be the only excuse for such a contrived, almost amateurish effort as ""Sons of Fortune"". Despite his background in politics Archer makes some careless mistakes of history (Henry Kissinger serving as LBJ's National Security Advisor for one). The timeline of the book is clearly unrealistic, as are many of the twists and turns in the plot. Archer should concentrate on writing short stories where such devices are the norm."
3,Engaging story,"Someone gave me the ABRIDGED audio version of this book. The story was interesting but the abridgement was excessive and made the already too-fantastic-to-be-believed set of coincidences in this story almost to much to bear. And yet, I enjoyed the story of these twins separated at the birth and their seemingly different yet parallel lines in studies, business and politics. If you use audio books, SKIP this abridgement."
1,awful beyond belief,"It doesn't take much for me to love a Jeffrey Archer book. I've thoroughly enjoyed every one of them. Until this one. Is it possible he had someone else write it for him to cover defense costs that resulted in his imprisonment?Fiction is an escape. It doesn't have to be completely plausible or believable to make it work. But this story is so totally absurd that I literally laughed out loud at some of the plot twists, only to find even more absurdity later on. Trite, stupid, inane. That doesn't even begin to describe this piece of garbage. Archer should be ashamed.Ordinarily, I would have told my wife to forget reading such a horrible waste, but in this situation I asked her to read it so she could understand my rants and tell me if I had gone mad. Her response was to read it. Her only comment was to throw it against the wall.Why do require me to give this even one star?"
2,Someone tell Mr. Archer that he has written similar stories before,"How many times will he use the same theme? Kane and Abel, another one with an Australian media moghul and this one. Two lives growing up apart and then coming together. Kane and Abel brought tears to eyes while reading description of Abel in Europe. This novel brought yawns.To be fair, I like his style, so kept reading. But overall everything was predictable."
2,A Fairy Tale for Prep-School New Englanders,"I was interested by the blurb on this audio CD and so rented it for a long drive. It started off fairly interesting as the initial set of circumstances and setting is well described. After that, it plays like a fairy-tale. The characters are totally one-dimensional and the plot is very contrived. There is one plot turn that is totally preposterous; the author must be out of touch with today's youth or must have been completely out of ideas to advance the plot. Not recommended."
2,Soap,"This book is about as close to a Soap Opera as you can getwithout video.The story is about twin brothers separated at birth and raisedby different families, and it follows their lives through aseries of coincidences that defies imagination. Even the authorreminds us that sometimes a rare coincidence does happen, buthe fails to convince us such a series of coincidences as heredescribed could actually happen.The story will appeal to a few, but there is no suspense, notension, no surprises, and one page reads like another. It isjust an on-going rather boring story, and people who actuallylived the lives fictionalized here couldn't possibly lead suchdull, predictable lives.There just isn't much here to engage any serious reader, andmost readers will want to avoid wasting their time with thisone."
2,Cardboard characters,"I've always been a fan of Jeffrey Archer, but I must admit that I'm a bit disappointed with this offering. The characters are cardboard cutouts. Both Fletcher & Nat are tall, good looking, extremely bright, witty, ambitious & with nerves of steel... there is not a single flaw in them! Ralph Ellison is the bad guy - slimy, evil... not a single virtue! And this separated at birth bit... come on, Lord Archer, you could've been a bit more original than that. . 'Kane & Abel', though similar (parallel lives etc.)was a far better book. My favourite remains ,Honour Among Thieves' apart from his early works."
2,Barely killed time,"I have read everyone of Jeffery Archer's books. His best is As the Crow Flies, this is his worst. Just a little to contrived and not very interesting."
2,Confusing read!,"Having been a fan of Jeffrey Archer since Kane and Abel I looked forward to this new novel. What a disappointment! I was confused and could not keep track of which twin was the Taft or Hotchkiss, Harvard or Yale, etc. Thought I must be losing it until the author showed he was in a fog as well, attributing a deed to one twin which belonged to the other. Mercy! I know the author is currently incarcerated but surely there are fewer distractions there and he could do better. Skip this one, Archer fans or have fun looking for errors. Where was his editor?"
3,a nice read,"I enjoyed this book. I read it in two days, even though the political parts of it were somewhat boring."
1,Absolute waste of time,"I can sum this entire book up as follows: absurd contrivance after absurd contrivance. His research regarding a criminal trial must have consisted of watching one episode of Perry Mason. Some of the plot twists are certainly surprising. Of course, that is because you could never imagine an author expecting anyone to believe them.Do not waste your time on this book."
3,Good budget buy,"Good for making basic sites, though doing anything more advanced (such as adding password access, setting up user databases, etc) is not well explained anywhere - even in the large manual I bought.My real problem is the severe lack of good templates - most look pretty 1990ish, and while you can find a couple to suit your needs, there aren't too many to choose from!Also, it is prone to make silly formating errors that will take you a while to figure out.Tech support is great though - they really help and are good at getting back to you.Good buy overall if you want more than a free basic site builder, but dont' want to spend more money for dreamweaver, etc."
5,Mutiny on the Bounty (2 Disc SE),I've been looking for this product for months. Should have known to come here first. Product was shipped promptly and in good shape.
3,What was he thinking?,"Leaving aside the question of which of the three ""Bounties"" is the best, the most dominant feature of this version, to me, is Brando's laughable Fletcher C. Yes, a foppish, arrogant English aristocrat will be foppish and arrogant. The problem is you get the idea Brando had never encountered, in real life, anyone to give him the basis to ground his performance in reality. It reveals an underlying flaw in method acting ... you can't make bricks without straw and you can't CONVINCINGLY portray a character of a specific class, time period and type just by making him or her up from within yourself."
1,"Not accurate to history, long, very slow","This is easily the worst of the three versions. Its historical accuracy is terrible and for some unknown reason the writers simply made up details that just never happened in any account. The ending is not even close. I didn't think Bligh seemed as cruel as his actions indicated. Christian was interestingly interpreted but did not seem authentic. As a huge Mutiny on the Bounty fan, having read multiple versions of the books and seen all the movies, I would not recommend this to anyone. Rent the 1st or 3rd version if you are only going to see one."
1,Bad Discs,"I had to order this disc twice, since the first one stopped playing in the middle of the movie, and the replacement they sent me did the exact same thing. It came through an outside supplier. I am very disappointed, as the price was great! I'm hoping at some point I will receive an unblemished copy....?"
1,Mutiny on the Bounty,"This earlier version of the epic tale of the sea is not as well done as the later version with Mel Gibson. Mr. Brando in my humble opinion did not play Fletcher Christian very convincing for a mutineer. The jacket states he is a 'dandy' transformed into a man of action--I am not convinced. He looked too much a dandy through the whole thing.Trevor Howard as William Bligh was not played affectivly as I think the book relates, but it did receive high praises from the Academy Awards nominating process, but like giving the Nobel Peace Prize to peace impersonators and politicans without credentials, the awards are somewhat suspicious whether they actually mean anything.Great work on the sailing of the ship though for when it was produced. Not comparible to 'Master and Commander' and the genius of Mel Gibson or Russell Crowe."
5,Excellent Movie!,"I haven't seen the Clark Gable 1935 version, but this is a very good movie.Stellar production and good DVD transfer.I think I actually prefer the Mel Gibson version, but this is a colorful interesting movie.A good movie to have in your collection for sure."
5,Excellent version,"As many times as I have watched this movie, it never fails to entertain. Trevor Howard is perfect as Blight, and never has Fletcher Christian, been better portrayed, as by Brando. Really beautiful cine-photography. I should mention that the ""shorts"" enclosed with this movie, are very informative and interesting also!"
1,Couldn't even watch!,"When I received the product the DVD case had a gash in the top right hand corner! The 1st disc (which contains the first half of the movie) did not work in my DVD player, nor my daughters. Had to return... Not pleased. Not pleased at all."
1,AN INACURATE AND DULL POTRAYL OF A FAMOUS STORY,"I would recommend skipping this version of MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY, it is too hollywood for anybody's taste. I felt that MARLON BRANDO never came even close to who FLETCHER CHIRSTIAN really was, he defintley not a prissy man this movie potrays and TREVOR HOWARD made BLIGH a lot worse than really who the real man was. He certinatley was not as sadistic this film made him out to be. I was extermley dissappointed in this film my advice would be to skip it. It can at times lull you to sleep espically MARLON BRANDO!!!"
1,"mutiny on the bounty, 1962 version","A beautifully photographed and acted movie, starring first-rate actors.I am building a model of Bounty, and seeing the picture really addedto my enjoyment of the event (novel?) that inspired the movie.I highly recommend this picture to history buffs and would-be sailorswho want to know what early Navy life was like and how it changed Navy life forever."
3,Gorgeous cinematogragphy; tedious plot,"The 1962 version of Mutiny on the Bounty (Marlon Brando) was far superior to the 1936 version with Clark Gable. The latter was in color, and we were treated to the lush photography of the Polynesian Islands. The 1962 version goes on for more than three hours,however, and is tedious and boring in spots.The film also presents a good catalogue of the various types of punishment that were inflicted on board British merchant marine vessels in the late 18th century. The flogging scene seems a bit phony, though, as it is extremely hard to believe that a man could receive two dozen lashes across his bare back with a metal-studded cat-o-nine tails and not make a single sound."
2,Brando's acting sinks the Bounty,"Marlon Brando's atrocious performance sinks this rendition of ""Mutiny on the Bounty."" While I don't object to the actor wanting to put his own stamp on the Mr. Christian role made famous by Clark Gable, his foppish, low-energy take on the role is completely inappropriate for the story. He simply isn't credible as a naval officer or a leader.Though Brando's bizarre performance is the big problem, the movie has some other problems too. For some reason, the story is not clearly focused on the conflict between Captain Bligh (Trever Howard in an adequate if not great performance) and Mr. Christian. All the distractions drain energy from the action. Some good supporting players like Richard Harris and the great African-American actor Frank Silvera are completely wasted in their roles.Do yourself a favor and watch the 1935 Charles Laughton/Clark Gable version instead. It may not be as pretty as this overblown white elephant, but it's a rip-roaring good time at the movies."
2,Mutiny on the Bounty (1962) HD DVD,"As I was viewing this movie (on my HD DVD player) it became obvious that video and audio were out of sync. I checked on other (HD)DVD's and everything was perfect, wich made me to believe that the problem was related to this particular DVD. I brought this to the attention of Amazon and they immediately corrected the situation by sending me another DVD. However, this one also exhibited the same lack of synchronisation between video and audio. What a shame, cause this movie belongs to my alltime favorites. So, two stars for the video part, wich was excellent, but minus three for the audio that was not able to keep up with the action."
5,If you don't watch this...you're missing out.,"If you want to watch a movie about the infamous Mutiny on the Bounty, and you want to see good acting, beautiful camera work, and hear a witty script -rent this version! Or better, buy it. It's fantastic and amazing... and though people are always putting it down, don't listen to them. Any movie about any type of historical event is going to have a thousand people nitpicking it, but just because they aren't satisfied with it because (good god, his accent isn't perfect! or, that isn't how that scene really happened!!) doesn't mean it isn't a good movie. Brando is, contrary to what everyone else has to say, perfect for the role of Fletcher Christian...and his acting makes the film worth watching."
5,1962 Mutiny More Textured Than 1935 Classic,"The 1962 Remake of MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY has received unfair critical bashing when compared to the 1935 version which was the Academy Award's Best Picture for that year. Though it is not superior to that version, The 1962 movie starring Marlon Brando and Trevor Howard presents a different story that is more realistic than the sometimes ""hollywoodized"" Clark Gable/Charles Laughton version. Treated most unfairly by critics is Brando's interpretation of Flectcher Christian which has been dismissed as foppish and ill-fitting. On the contrary, Brando moreso than Gable makes Christian a human agonizingly torn between what is moral righteousness and not a swashbuckling comic book hero as in the 1935 movie. In addition, viewers will find Brando's transformation from the familiar rebel we know to the British,aristocratic, snotty and unassuming mutineer truely intriguing."
5,Mutiny On The Bounty,"To me, this is what I call a "" Classic Film "" One you can watch again and again and always enjoy. Superb story line with some historical factual links, great acting from Brando and Howard. wonderful scenery etc.Just buy at the steal of a price and I'm sure you will enjoy it"
1,Only one disc would play,The first disc would not play in any machine it tried (3). The 2nd disc was OK. The item was returned and I was given a no hassle refund.
5,MOTB from '62,Excellent three hour movie starring Marlon Brando. This version of Mutiny on the Bounty is the absolute best. It can be seen by the entire family and will keep you enthralled the entire time. Simply great !!
4,Mutiny on the Bounty,this film has aged well. although the story is well known and not historically accurate and has been produced since (and before) this production this is still my favorite.
1,"Mutiny on the bounty, no rating Im not too happy...","The first disk was bad, it wouldn't work in three DVD players...I sent a email to Amazon but to date they haven't responded...the second disk is fine, its just the first one thats bad....first time this has ever happened in all my orders with Amazon.com."
1,Mutiny on the Bounty from Warehouse Deals,"Don't buy this product if it is shipped from Warehouse Deals. I did and the DVD will not load on DVD players in the US and Canada, even though they say it is for this area."
2,Skip This One,"This film is at least one hour too long. It is slow and tedious and frequently painful to watch. Marlon Brando, as was his wont, interpreted his character in a way that no one had before, but it just didn't work in this film. Try one of the other versions of this classic story."
4,Tale of Two Cities,"If you are interested in the link between institutional design and gigantic practical consequences, then Fuchs' book is for you. The claim is that Chicago escaped the Great Fiscal Crisis suffered by NYC in part because Chicago had a strong political machine (aka Daley) that could say ""no"" to its public employee unions. In addition, Fuchs has detailed description of how Chicago's reliance on legal devices like special districts rather than special authorities -- the NYC specialty -- may have kept Chicago's budget under control. I teach local government law, and any book that can give me the skinny on how and why law matters is always welcome. This book does very well on that score: You will never be bored by the details of how muni bonds are funded again. Turns out that cities rise and collapse on the basis of such ""boring"" stuff."
2,Not a heavy weight liner,This is not a heavy weight liner. Not much different than what I would get at any store. When it said hotel quality...I expected much more than what I got. I figured it wouldn't be much for $5.99 so I gave it a try. Won't buy another one from this company.
5,Strongly recommended,"Policy Paradox is truly a gem. Stone's language is clear, entertaining and very educating. The book is very witty and can be recommended to anyone interested in the peculiarities of political decision-making. I treasure my copy."
5,BoC,60% Autechre 20& Aphex Twin 15% Plaid 5% Wagon Christ...or 0% of anything and 100% Boards of Canada.
2,new age electronic lounge music,"hmmm. i must admit i'm confused by all the effusive praise heaped on this album by the legions of rabid Boards of Canada supporters out there. maybe I'm missing something. this entire album sounds like background music for a stark, highly stylized and designed lounge in New York or Stockholm where turtlenecked hipsters sit on uncomfortable chairs and talk quietly with expensive cocktails. Or maybe tunes for a Diesel store? It is indeed mellow in a repetitive, ""what will they do with their Moog synthesizer and drum machine next?"" kind of way. It's just not all that challenging or interesting to listen to, in my opinion. I guess I'd just suggest that anyone ready to hit ""Add to cart"" first give the linked track snippets a listen first to make sure they know what they're getting into here.... If Boards of Canada is your favorite band and you love floaty, stylized, synthesizer noodling, then more power to you and enjoy this album."
3,I thought it would be better...,"When I first listened to some samples from this CD, I was expecting greatness. However, it's pretty average in the end. Nothing to me really stands out. I could listen to it, but it's not something that I'd want to come back to."
2,Highly mediocre,"I know I am committing an act of heresy here, but this album really isn't that great, though I concede there is a great deal of wasted potential here. It certainly has moments, but they all fail to coalesce into anything meaningful, lasting, or ultimately worth my time. I was looking for something similar to Autechre, or Jega, and found this not only to be neither, but also not even something that l could listen to more than a handful of times."
2,Don't believe the hype.,Leftover ideas. Thrift store sounds. Cookie-cutter ambience compiled buy suits working from market research.
5,Hints of Aphex Twin?,"This is a fantastic album--it's warm, fuzzy, detached, and dreamy, but what I appreciate the most about it is its remarkable consistency. Every song feels right, and the resulting effect is a deeper musical immersion. The structure is also a nice change--each longer song is interleaved with a shorter song (well, with a couple of exceptions), lending a nice overall rhythm to the album.In listening to a couple of tracks, I was reminded of the strange disembodied effect of Aphex Twin's Selected Ambient Works II; they both have that fuzzy analog and strange, far-off sound. Boards of Canada, however, sounded much warmer and inviting.This is a fantastic album for listening to individual tracks or for kicking back and exploring another world for a blissful 70 minutes. I haven't encountered many performers who could produce such an effect as Boards of Canada, and I certainly have never found a sound quite like this."
5,off the hook,"This album is so beautiful and fearless that it makes a good portion of what I have been listening to seem contrived. This album has refined my expectations of contemporary music. It is just what the doctor ordered if you crave music that is aggressive in all its contentions. In this case, these contentions come down to one central thing: Around us, there is beauty and there is pain."
5,Essential!,"Why isn't there more hype about this cd in the press? Based on the plethora of positive reviews on this cd (which I'm about to add to), I checked it out. Needless to say, I was not disappointed. Mind-blowing, psychedelic, trippy analog funk and ambience. Headphone music or crank it on a phat system. If you like Plaid, you'll love it. Gorgeous melodies. A lesson on how you're supposed to use a sampler. Pure techno bliss. I guess that's enough superlatives. Just buy it, I think you'll like it. Track 17 is IMPORTANT!"
4,Intresting,"After reading the reviews for this cd i thought it was a pretty safe choice... yep! It's a good cd and worth the money, i'll let others more qualified than myself detail the cd... im busy listening to their second cd ""Geogaddi"""
3,Overated completely but Ok.,Boards of Canada's MHTRTC is perhaps one of electronic musics most overated albums- nonetheless it is still worthwhile. What really lets this album down is the percussion and beat which is soulless. The background odd chordal changes and blurry soundscapes are ruined by what at times seems like a rigid drum machine patch or sampled drum loop youve heard before. Its a shame as i do like the haunting quality of some of the melody's notes and childhood memories the music conjures up. I actually think Geogaddi is a much better album than this. And i still prefer Future Sound of London or Broadcast in the end. Id pick up Geogaddi instead but this is still a nice addition just not the holy grail so many have made it out to be.
5,One of the best electronic albums evah,"like the last who posted a comment on this album almost 3 years ago, i agree that this album comes with the highest recommendations. i've taken this album all around the world with me and i must say, that no matter what situation you are in, or where you are, this album will make everything that much better. unfortunately, their 2nd album geogaddi, was lacking something as most sophmore albums do. hopefully their 3rd release will make up for the slack. Regardless, Music has the right is a classic and if electro is your thing, and you're looking to chill, then this is the album you need to have."
4,Accessibility is key,"Music Has the Right to Children's flow isn't as strong as Geogaddi's, but the quality tracks are present. The most trip-hop apparent full-length album by the duo. Key tracks are: roygbiv, Aqaurius, and Happy Cycling.A lot of interlude tracks detract from an otherwise solid album. Some of the interlude tracks are extremely enjoyable though, see: Kaini Industries and Smokes Quantity."
5,a masterpiece,"You can forget aphex, funkstorung, autechre and the like. Go buy this album. Now.Please. I've been listening to this album every day for 2 years now, and I still LOVE it ! It's cold and warm, soft and rough, slow and up beat, profound and you can dance on it. This album is perfect."
4,Inspired Analog Soundings,BOC use analog or analog mimicry to make interesting music that at times sound like old 70's/80's soundtrack's to corporate video promotional videos or old Moog type music for b-movie sci-fi and it works very well. The themes seem to center around the dreamlike wonderland state of children as their voices are featured in some samples. Interesting chill out trip hop that I found myself listening to again and again. I must investigate them further.
1,A New Approach,"Please read Romans 4:1-5 And rember faith not works!This is out of the book (Does your church teach with the Authority of Christ?) This is a great question this other review gives us no answers. A Catholic may tell you Peter is the first Pope, but how is that since Peter never went to Rome?Another thing found in the book,(""While the argument that Jesus spoke Aramaic, and thus used the Aramaic word `kephas' is a common defensive apologetical argument, let me point out the guerrilla way to address the topic - ask your friend, `What did the followers of Christ call Simon, Kephas or Petros?'"" Nowak then provides Bible references where Simon is more often called Kephas.)This is important becuse, Peter is not the only rock the Church was built on."
1,Very Disapointed,"I expected this Colander to be of top quality!Wow was I wrong!This comes from China, it didn't sit stright, it wobble on the counter.The pattern wasn't even put on even!I do think it has that good looking Villeroy & Boch pattern.I did plan on useing this, but it was smaller then what I thought, and not very practical, but not sitting stright,and the pattern was uneven, I did return this.Maybe nobody else would notice that, if you just wanted to put in some apples, or bannans!but I thought it look cheap.I was very disapointed, I expected more from Villeroy & Boch."
2,Bad Transmission,"I bought this T6500R set 2 weeks ago and to my dismay, this claimed 5 miles range 2-way radio barely even reached 1 mile of successful clear transmission. It wasn't even operated in a closed area like in a house or a building. I used it in an open area, with the 2 radios seperated by couple of blocks. As a matter of fact, it didn't even reach 1/2 mile when transmission starts breaking up and gets noisy. If gone further than that, it's a total transmission lost. Moreover, the battery drains pretty fast also. Gotta say that it's really dissapointing having to spend 50 over dollar for below 1/2 miles of talking range."
1,Not worth the money,I had no luck with this item. Sound was completely distorted and range was less than 1/2 mile on full power with no obstructions.If anything in the way I lost total comunications.It seemed to eat battery power pretty quick too.
1,Functional but sounds fuzzy,"At first I really liked the features and successful company backing offered with these radios. Then I ordered them, tried them for an hour and ended up hating them. The funtionality and ergonomics are great. They feel fine in your hand and the quality of the buttons, screen and range are fine -- BUT! I couldn't understand a word a person was saying into the other radio. At any volume level it was fuzzy, muddy and completely distorted. This was equally irritating on either radio. There was no interference, no static, just inconceivable communication. I also tried other GMRS radios from other manufacturers and found some to be identical, and one to be perfect. Among the others was another Motorola brand that was much higher in price and featured higher quality, but sounded exactly the same. So I think it's a design flaw in thier speakers. Fix that, and future models might turn out fine."
1,Why can't they be honest?,10 miles? I bought the 6510 at Costco. I had my doubts but I figured if they advertised 10 miles surely it would do at least a couple. But only if you are on the water or other flat plain. Why do you need one of these if you can see the person? They only work if you have a direct line of sight and that was only a mile or two at most. But get over a hill or within trees or houses and absolutely nothing! I lost my party!Pros - I liked the design and it was easy to use. The NOAA weather did work - if that's all you need. Fits in a pocket.Cons - DOES NOT WORK to keep track of your party. It takes 14 hours to recharge.The good reviews in here must work for Motorola. Mine are going back to the store.
1,Not even close,"I'm with some of the other reviewers here.. I didn't really expect to get full range, but when testing in a suburban Virginia neighborhood I barely got 4 blocks (~ 3/4 mi). Unless you're on a lake they are pretty much useless."
2,Fair range/reception at best.,"I purchased these radios not having first hand experience with FRS/GMRS radios at all. But I did do a lot of research. Unfortunately most of the negative reviews I read about them were true for me. The 1 watt of power only got me about .5 mile of reception at best. The people who only need two-way radios for usage ranges of less than this may love this radio. If this does not describe you, then I strongly recommend going for a higher wattage model (for example I now know that Midland makes some excellent 4 and 5 watt models). Power = range. The advertised max ranges of all radios can likely only ever be reached under extremely ideal conditions. That's marketing for you. I did return the Motorolas and got my money back."
3,Another Vanilla Consumer Product from Motorola,"For years Motorola has cornered the mass consumer market for hand held radios, the T6500 is simply another moderately good radio for your day to day consumer.Positives:Acceptable range for consumer radio in this price range.Rechargeable batteries nice for daily use.Logical design, quality plastics, aesthetically pleasing.Negatives:Bulky/too large to fit into pockets.Poor (rounded) design of the rechargeable base makes for poor connection and does not always charge as expected.Belt clip accessory feels cheap/not for serious users.Cannot prevent 'blip' noise between communications, annoys in descreet settings.Overall, Motorola makes a solid consumer product, but if you're looking for powerful range and something that does not look like a toy, look elsewhere."
2,Poor product quality,"I'm a licensed HAM Radio operator and I'm quite familiar with things like this.Of the two radios, one works, the other one squelches every 30 seconds or so no matter what I set it to. We have 2 motorola units and two Xact wrist radios as well.The only one that has problems is this one Motorola unit. Since the other Motorola one works, I'm guessing (hoping) this is not a design flaw, but a QC problem.Overall, stay away from this one."
5,Best Product On Market,"These radios are the best. The batteries last very long ( if you charge them right ) and the sound quality is very good. They work very well, even with trees around. You can use them with most Motorola products like headfones and mikes and they still work exceptionally. Very much worth the money."
3,Eternal Tears Losing its edge?,"Eternal tears of sorrow is a great Melodic Death Metal band. Their 1997 album Sinners Serenade is my personal favorite. Everything up to this album has been in a raw yet melodic style. This album incorporates influences of Black Metal and Death metal. The excessive keyboardwork really ruins the fun of the songs. In someways the keyboarding sounds like Children of Bodom. Overall this album was decent, the older stuff is better without a doubt. The side project of this band is Kalmah, the two sound somwhat similar but if I had to pick, I'd get Kalmahs Svamplord over this. It's mixed much better and just sounds complete compared to this."
4,Just as much fun as I remember!,"I read some Usagi Yojimbo in the late 80's and always liked the stories. Now that the books have all been collected, I have decided to make sure thay all get added to my collection. This first volume was great. Sakai brings a whimsical touch to Edo period Japan. Its great to start from the very beginning and learn the origins of Usagi and some of the other characters that appear in these volumes. Although there is some whimsy, there is also plenty of sword swinging action and a good amount of bloody deaths. The quality of this book was better than some but not excellent. The binding is sewn but the paper quality is mid range. This is ok since the book is black and white, and I will continue to purchase all of the many volumes in the Usagi Yojimbo saga."
2,Headtrip!!,"I found this book to be a nauseating headtrip. Yes, there was some interesting if not valuable information, but you'd go nuts if you were to take it all on board & in the manner prescribed. I wouldn't recomend this book to a teenager or young adult without life perspective. Some of it may get you pumped up, though there's no info for the gut or the heart. As well it only skims on many issues, though seemingly infering that's all you need. It will open your eyes - however relevant depends on where you are on your journey. I'd regard this as more of a tabloid 'self help"" book. If you want to go deep, look else where."
4,"Great book, but gets a little bit repetitive","A lot of the ideas are repeated over and over throughout different chapters. When these ideas were repeated I found myself zoning out or skimming past to try to find something new. I realize that repetition is one of the key foundations for his teachings, but too much can make one doze off. Otherwise, a GREAT book!"
4,what happened to ATGW?,"i went to both of Robbin's websites and there is no mention of this book ""Awaken the Giant Within"". Does this mean he has renounced what he wrote in ""awaken...?""I found the book very helpful but am a bit confused as to why he himself no longer promotes this book on his websites."
1,I am now dumber from having read this,"I can't stop reading a book once I start, because if I do I feel that I've wasted my time. Well I decided to cut my losses and give up about a hundred pages shy on this one. It is completely outdated, in contrast to modern medicine, and otherwise fluff with a bit of commons sense thrown in. Imagine sitting through the worst class in school you've ever had and that is what reading this book is like. He admits right at the start that he threw this book together in a very short amount of time due to publishing deadlines and it shows in the content. Some of his ""new science"" is downright ridiculous to the point of being funny. It appears he wrote this book because someone offered him a book deal based on his reputation and his work is lazy and misleading. If I could rate this book a ""no stars"" I would. Save your money. Dr. Seuss is more helpful than Mr. Anthony Robbins. However, if you are stupid and gullible, you may enjoy this book."
1,Should be Titled : How to Repeat the Same Thing to Make $$,.People don't understand .. talk is cheap and it is easy advise people as they are ready to listen good talk and easy to talk about Unlimited Power ... blah .. blah ...I would give 1 star as there is nothing new science here and don't waste your $$$'s.
4,"OK, a little corny but...","Tony's enthusiasm for this stuff is great. Some of the material is a bit silly, but to paraphrase Tony- ""If you can get one or two idea's, then the book is worth while"". This is the case with this book. The two sections I enjoy (and revisit) are his section on goal setting, and the chapter on breaking out of limiting beliefs. Like any self-help book if you don't do the exercises the material will not help you.Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a simple starting point in personal development."
2,Very vague,"This book is a really long book for a self-help book. I am in immediate need of help and I have to read 400 pages? Is it worth the read? Not. Is it inspirational? Slightly. It is a very vague book on NLP popularized by Bandler and Grinder. You are better off searching for books by these guys. For even better stuff, search for book under Milton Erickson, the father of hypnosis whom Bandler and Grinder studied under. Why am I telling you all this? Well, this book is basically on human psychology. To understand yourself and others, this is the topic to study and what this book preaches, but very vaguely. Robbins has become a very wealthy man because of other people's work which once again proved you don't have to invent or build a better mouse trap. You only need to market it well."
5,Love Love Love,You can only improve things by reading this book. All of Anthony's book make so much sense. I like to read his material while I'm working out.
2,"Classic anthony robbins, outdated now",The book is 400 pages long and features concepts that tony robbins has been promoting endlessly. I feel that the book is very wordy and verbose. Also the advice it gives about nutrition is at least dangerous and at least not scientifically sound that is why I am giving 2 stars instead of 4.
2,MASSIVE CONTRADICTIONS,"When you read his books, they seem like they're great, right? But didn't you ever get the feeling that you didn't know how to apply all of that into your life? That's because his teachings are packed with contradictions and if you read his 2 major books very carefully, you cannot possibly miss them. Try it! I've found at least 17 contradictions, i.e., there are things that he says in a certain page that contradict things on other pages. I was very dissapointed with that."
2,Food Advice is Wrong,"Tony oversimplied ways to eat right for good health. Changing diet dramatically can be hazardeous to your normally good health. I know because I followed his eating advice for a year and I got real sick. My advice is to stick with your cultural and family food types and try to improve from there (not to replace it as suggested by Tony). Your blood and digestive systems can't and will not handle drastic changes quickly.In addition, depending on your work and living habit, you may prefer a fast-burning diet (lots of protein) over a slow-metabolism one (more carbohydrates). You have to do some experiments and make adjustment accordingly. You may need certain types of food more at a certain part of your life. So, don't just eat what the book said."
4,ebook more expensive than paperback,But I can't share it or resell it?! On top of that I saved some trees and CO2 on shipping! Why?
2,Very disappointing,"I bought this book after reading Unlimited Selling Power--a great book. This one by Anthony Robbins leaves much to be desired. Interesting reading, but low on content.I highly recommend Unlimited Selling Power for some real techniques. For relationships, read Phillip McGraws books. For personal development read Stephen Covey or Denis Waitley.If you just like to read, then borrow this one from your library or pick it up for [low price] at a second hand book store."
5,Had to add my 5 stars!,"I gave this five stars and send in this review just to push this great work on up to where it belongs. I have a bookshelf full of self help tapes, some good, like Zig Ziglar, Louisa Hays, Depak Chopra, some really terrible and rip offs. I really don't like being ripped off in the name of ""inspiration"". But this is really the best motivational tape I've come accross in years, better than others by the author. It's fun to listen to, insightful, intelligent without being condescending or partonizing, just a very inspirational and motivational work. Something different about it strikes me every time I listen to it. It's gotten me back on track after a lull in my life, gotten my juices flowing again and I'm already achieving greater success in all important areas of my life...what else can I tell you? Try it, it's worth the price of the purchase, I promise.Hal D."
4,A Great Book on NLP and Motivation,"Anthony Robbins is one of the authorities on NLP and Motivation.This is the book that got me interested in NLP; and even though I'm now a Master NLP Practitioner and a successful Networker in an international MLM Company, this is one book that I always recommend to all my downlines as well as all those who desire to excel in personal mastery.James LeongAuthor of The World's First Book onNetwork Marketing with NLP,""MLM Persuasion Mastery: HowMaster Networkers Change Beliefsand Behavior"""
1,A waste of time and money,"This audio cassette is worthless. Tony Robbins works himself up into near orgiastic frenzy telling the listener to pursue his dreams. The text is New Age airy-fairy cheerleading. The speaker's voice is so graveley that it is hard to listen to. I kept wondering if he had vocal polyps or laryngeal cancer, and I hope he reads this review and goes for a medical checkup. How can a man who has so little of substance to say and who takes such poor care of his own health and vocal cords be in a position to advise anyone else. I only rated this tape with 1 star because a zero score was not possible."
4,great book,Tony Robbins stuff is great. Lifechanging self help that works in real life. It was recommended by David DeAnggelo a excellent dating coach and life guru. Also recommend RSD blueprint decoded. CLASS
4,It is up to you what you do with it,"If you start this book as a non believer and finish it as a non believer, then you are a basket case. What more can be written about how you should approach your life? The book has a very logical arrangements of chapters. It gives many hints and touches many different aspects of life. The most important messages are: take your life in your hands and help other people. But as I said, if you do not believe you can do it or that you should not do it, than you predetermine the results of your life. I recommend to combine Tony Robbins books with books by Zig Ziglar and Deepak Chopra."
1,More Limited than Some May Think,"This stuff is common sense, mixed in with several psychological and philosophical ideas. Reading the book will not change your life. I think if you attempt some of the tings here, you will wind up in rather comical situation. Imagine mimicking someone and getting called on it, like this: ""Are you mocking me?"" ""What's wrong with you?"" etc. Hilarious, but not very effective."
5,Good Stuff this,I'll keep it short.This is NLP for the average person. His style of writing allows the reader both enjoy and learn from this book.
4,From author of Anthony Robbins Life Story,"I couldn't believe that Anthony Robbins wrote this book in a month, but he proclaims that he did. I read the book many times, and one of the best ideas was to leave your wallet, money, keys, everything behind, and go to a city you have never been before, and use what you have learned to survive. I must admit that I slept outside the first night, but after that I quickly found solutions with the help of this book."
3,Motivational,"At times, Unlimited Power is painfully simplistic. Robbins uses silly anecdotes to emphasis some of his points, and some of his points boil down to basic common sense. Other times, however, he is able to verbalize what I considered to be very real, very helpful strategies for actually increasing personal power. The book is well worth reading (just read it quickly) and will likely continue to help people take control of their lives."
5,Incredible.,"Everyone on earth, needs to read this book.A lot of NLP tactics are used in this book, but hey whatever gets the job done.What I've learned through this book:- how to change my physiology to change my current state of emotions- how to better manage my emotions and time- how to build rapport with others- to really know and understand what I want- new techniques on how to completely delete bad thoughts- so much other stuff!your gonna love this book, it's basically just you that's helping you and in the end who else is gonna help."
5,Provides Insight for the Prospective Ivy Athlete (& their parents),"I have a high school senior son who is looking to participate in college sports after graduation and I was looking for a book that would help provide some understanding of the whole Ivy recruiting process. This book provided great insight into the Ivy recruiting process from both the college coaches and administrators perspective. It provides the insight though true experiences of athletes, coaches and administrators. It also sheds light on the conflicts within the Ivy League about the process."
5,Great info about the different world of Ivy League football recruiting,"This book, providing excellent, easy-to-read and understand information, is a must for any high school football player (and his parents) who hopes to play or wants to know more about the possibilities of playing in the Ivy League. Recruiting in that league is quite different than recruiting at most other college programs. -- Ray Grasshoff, author of Beyond Friday Nights: College Football Recruiting for Players and Parents (Beyond Friday Nights: College Football Recruiting for Players and Parents)"
4,It's ok,"I bought this book used, and it came in good condition. I got what was labelled as the 'Examination Copy' but it is no different from the student copies of my classmates. It's not that difficult to read, includes real life example and applications of the information that are a great aid. The only real issue I can see is if you have absolutely no interest or prior knowledge of anything related to American Politics."
4,Not as expected,"I was so excited to see this movie. I totally adore Julia Stiles and I loved Save the Last Dance. I knew this was a tragedy and all, but I have to tell you that it was not what I expected at all. This one is pretty dark ladies and gentlemen. I would definately watch it, but it upset me so badly I almost cried. It was disturbing. I could have waited a little longer."
1,So Bad It's Laughable,"The movie is so shallow and absurd. Josh Hartnett for some reason is able to control the other characters in the play so well they will do whatever he wants them to, even commit murder. It's absolutely awful. There isn't a good thing about the movie. I suppose that you're supposed to feel sorry for the people's lives Josh ruins and hate him for it, but in reality he was my favorite character and I thought all the drama he created was mainly their own fault for being so dumb."
2,So much potential...,"Great play, great concept, LOUSY execution! I agree with another reviewer who commented on the bad sound editing. I could barely understand what was being said at times, even when I replayed the scene.The script is badly written with a very slow beginning and an unrealistic building of the plot. Odin goes berserk with little prompting and Desi does virtually nothing to persuade him otherwise. Some of the more dramatic scenes are played out chillingly, but the build up is lacking and an increasingly inappropriate soundtrack plagues the viewer throughout the movie. Apparently the director felt that a movie with an African-American main character can't possibly have good music.Some of the acting is very well done, but overall I expected much more. They took a great concept and made a film of mediocre quality at best."
3,very good revamping of Othello.,"When I got the DVD of this movie today, I thought, ""Well, let's see how Josh Hartnett does as a villian."" I was very surprised at how unlikable and yet sympathetic his Hugo was. Phifer was excellent as Odin and Stiles was good as always as Desi. Not quite a powerful as Oliver Parker's 1995 edition, but O was certainly more relevant after the Columbine shootings (the reason this movie sat on the shelf for 2 years). I really became engrossed with the storyline and found it refreshing to see Hartnett play someone not so nice."
5,Realistic...,"I'm an aspiring music critic...I don't consider myself necessarily qualified to give an ""educated critique"" per se, but I feel compelled to comment nonetheless: I highly recommend this film...and look out for great performances - especially by Josh Hartnett, Mekhi Phifer, and Rain Phoenix (yes, Joaquin and the late River's younger sister)...I thoroughly enjoyed this film because more than anything, I found it to be realistic; it took an unblinking look at the issues it dealt with, and I was all the more grateful. Bravo."
2,Typical teen fare...,"With Othello being one of my favorite plays, I thought I would have enjoyed this more. I knew, it being the 21st century and all, that I shouldn't expect a total repeat of the play. What I got was far worse. The acting and plot was good, but the details left so much more to be desired. The sex scenes were not needed, and I'm certainly no prude. They added nothing to the story, nor did the steroid scene. I wasn't expecting an exact interpretation of Shakespearean tragedy, but I was expecting something far better than this."
3,"high school basketball ""othello""","The play Othello is rest in modern times with the high school ""prep"" star ""Odin"" as Othello. His teammate and the coach's son has the Iago role of a scheming and evil ""friend"". He turns the main characters against each otherby ""playing"" them with lies and using a stolen handkerchief his girl friend obtains. The movie like the play was hard for me to watch. Half way through I realized it was Othello in modern drag and it became easier, since I knew it was a love gone wrong tragedy. The Shakespeare play has dialog by Iago that makes his motivations clearer than the nice bright high school boy gone wrong in this movie. The movie has basketball, drugs and guns added, but results are pretty much the same.The acting is pretty good actually, but intense introspectivedialog that should be there seems left out to me.the results are pretty much the same"
4,Hawking around.,"O starring Mekhi Phifer is a film adaptation of William Shakespeare's tragic play, Othello. Phifer is superb in the title role, his perfromance is heartbreaking and intense. Julia Stiles is also quite good in this, she plays Desi, O's girlfriend. Josh Hartnett and Andrew Keegan aren't talented actors but their roles are highly important to this story. I like this film, highly under-rated. Check it out sometime!"
2,Over-Age Cast Trying to Play Teenagers,"The principal actors are way too old to be credible as teenagers. So why place the story in a prep school setting? It's fiction, so it could have been easily placed in a college setting to make this cast credible if they were really set on hiring this cast. Or they could have hired younger actors to credibly play teenagers. The mis-match of actors and roles is a distraction."
4,It was,"I went and saw this movie with my friend and her aunt. We're both 13. I wanted to see it because of Josh Hartnett and Julia Stiles. Watching that movie in front of her aunt was embarassing. I felt almost embarassed walking out of the theatre. That movie was deep, dark, and disturbing. We were both shaking on the ride home.Besides the fact that it scared the hell out of me, I really liked the movie. Josh Hartnett's acting was wonderful as he played evil Hugo Goulding. Mekhi Phifer's acting was pretty good especially near the end. Julia Stiles was a big disappointment. In many of her other movies, she was a girl with an attitude. In 'O', she sat their like a bug, as if she was just watching everything around her.I would go see this movie again and I'm glad I saw it"
4,Heart stopping and intense,"""o"" was an exceptional movie. I have never been much for drama but I descided to see it anyway. Josh hartnett's ( Black hawk down, 40 days and 40 nights) performance was breakthough. It really showed how talented he is. Mekhi Phifer (Honey, 8 mile) and Julia Stiles { Save the last dance, 10 things I hate about you) shared alot of depth and chemistry in this film. Tim Nelson did a great job foccusing on Josh Hartnett and Mekhi Phifer's strange relationship together. This move was very intense and full of twists and turns. The cast was nearly perfect. I beleive every actor play there part exactly as was scripted plus added edgy touches and breakthrough perfomances. If you are easily frusterated with drama movies I do not reccomend this movie. But if you enjoy intensity and drama this move is a definate for you."
1,DVD didn't work,I sent this back because the sound was off from the dvd. No matter what I did or whose player I tried the sound was laid down differently from the movie portion.
2,Yawn,"This movie was held up by the studio for various reasons but it should have been shelved permanently! It was obviously early in the careers of some of the actors (this is Julia Stiles at her worst) so I can let a little bit slide.The story itself is a novel twist on Othello taking place at a private school in the South. Class lines, racial themes, etc. are all addressed and neatly packaged in this teen flick. However, the story itself just drags on forever until you want them all to be killed! Really, really putrid acting made it even worse! Reading the original play by Shakespeare would be more fun.On a good note, Josh Hartnett was great. You could see even then that he was going to be a star!"
5,~*^ Amazing Movie~*^,"I just wanted to tell everyone who reads this that if you buy this DVD or VHS you won't be dissapointed. I highly recommend you purchase this. I dont know anyone that has not loved this movie.It is such a great movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat and makes you cry to feel the characters pain. It is a moderization of the Shakesphere story ""Othello"" but definately modern and not the least bit boring. The main characters Julia Stiles / Mekhi Phiffer/ and Josh Hartnett do a great job as they bring out love hate angry jealousy envy to the story."
3,Because I brought this product for viewing in Australia I have had problems with the region. I will not buy DVDs again,"I have viewed this before and know it is a good film to use in High school to compare with Othello. However, I needed it for Australian viewing and it was the wrong region. This was disappointing and I will not buy any DVDs from this site unless I can be guaranteed of Australian region."
1,o,if i could understand italian i would have probably enjoyed it.was not aware it was an italian version
3,This is a very weird movie,"When I first saw heard about ""O"", I thought it was going to be another teen movie, which I love, with actors such as Josh Hartnett and Julia Stiles. But then I watched it and I was freaked out. I hadn't seen the previews and I don't know the story ""Othello"" from which the movie is based, so I rented it because I love Julia Stiles so much. Well, I was wrong about it being another teen movie. Josh Hartnett goes, I think, psycho and kills (or is involved in killing) all his friends at his school. I didn't expect it to be a slasher movie, but that's what it turned out to be (sorry if I ruined it for anyone). It was pretty good, but I don't think the actors and actresses were appropriate for these roles."
1,In a word: horrid.,"It pained me to sit through this movie and I would have turned it off after the first ten minutes if I didn't have to write a comparative analysis between it and Shakespeare's ""Othello."" The writing is terrible, the acting is so-so, the music is the pits, there is WAY too much emphasis on race, and the relationship between Odin and Desi is a joke. I'm supposed to believe he went stark-raving mad over a girl he had been dating for four months? Give me a break--I ended up laughing through the majority of this movie simply because it was so bad. This is teenaged melodrama at its worst."
1,Poor Shakespeare,"If Shakespeare could come back to life and see what they made with his play ""Othello"", he would remove Heaven and Earth crying out for justice. Be an actor in a play of Shakespeare it's difficult and only the best ones can do it, not mediocre actors with face of children. What's Martin Sheen doing here? He should be in better movies and in this trash, if you want a good ""Othello"" adaptation, get the movie with Kenneth Brannag and Laurence Fishburne, are good actors and a better movie."
2,"Fine for personal entertainment, but not for classroom","This rendition of Othello may be fine to watch for personal entertainment, but I would not attempt to show it to students, even if you were to try to get permission. In addition, you must have a high tolerance for cussing in order to watch it. The movie was over for me after Julia Stiles made her first appearance, cussing up a storm with all the men in the room. Everyone had been cussing non-stop, and I finally had enough--it seemed to be done just for the sake of using bad language, not for any larger aesthetic purpose.I let a colleague have my DVD, and she watched it herself, thinking she would try to show it to her students. She made it through half the movie before deciding it absolutely could not be used as a teaching resource. Besides all the cussing and sex, the movie is so updated and changed that it might even confuse students who are trying to understand the main events of the play."
4,Pretty good.,It's a shame how Hugo was able to play on O's fears and feelings and drive him to do what he did. This is why it pays to think for yourself and don't let others get into your head. O and Desi seemed to have a trusting relationship...why the heck would she be messing w/his best friend? These are questions O should have asked himself.This whole story is a tragedy and it was very well acted. You could just follow O's sinking into despair. I recommend this one.
3,Interesting,"As someone who has read and watched Othello many times on stage, I thought this modern take on Shakespeare's most relevent-for-today tragedy was a great example of how Shakespeare can truly translate into the problems of our day: racism, bi-racial sterotypes and fears, jealousy, class, race, etc. The acting was superb, as always, Julie Stiles glows in every role she plays. However, at times I couldn't help but feel as if the movie was either trying too hard to follow the exact plot of Othello, or was confused along the way and added other events and scenes to cover what they lost. But overwall, not a bad modern version of Othello (near the end was well-acted and quite bone chilling...). But it's not really worth buying, probably best to rent this one."
4,"""O""",This movie was a good modern day adaptation of Shakespear's Othello. I forgot though about a couple of graphic scenesand how much of a tragedy it was and allowed some younger teens to watch it. I believe the guidelines should be adhered to on this movie.
4,a good introduction,"I was given this book when I was given my cat, Mara Jade. The book was for 2 main reasons. One was to explain and understand this most loveable breed. The other was to show off my cat's grandfather, who is one of the champion Scottish Folds showcased in the book. It is a good book for new owners."
5,A Great Read!,"A late-comer to the Priscilla Flanders mysteries, I recently picked up A Rather Necessary End. I was immediately hooked and had to search out the rest of the books in the series. Each one was a delight, and The Wedding Caper is no exception!Priscilla is an intelligent, keen-eyed sleuth and Sir Neville is her perfect counterpoint. I've thoroughly enjoyed watching their relationship develop through the series. As a die hard Georgette Heyer fan, I'm also delighted with Ms. Ferguson's ability to sketch the Regency scene to pefection."
4,For the Scholarly Tolkien fan,"I have been reading this book as part of a research project. The essence of the book is a play by play of the development of the LOTR through multiple drafts. If someone is looking for a continuation of the entertaining series, I would suggest first The Silmarillion, then Lost Tales, Lays of Beleriand, or Unfinished Tales. For the serious Tolkien fan who wants to understand the origins, the book does a good job of organizing the multiple drafts and highlighting significant shifts in Tolkien's thought."
3,A good basis for beginners,"Having just recently inherited two fancy goldfish (an orange veilteil and a black moor), I realized that what I knew about fish would not fill a shot glass. Not wanting to do these beautiful creatures any harm, I began a frantic search for help. This is one of the books I have found that has been a great help to me--especially in the area of my greatest concern--the health of the animals. It gives a good description of fish diseases, such as symptoms to look for, and prevention and cures. It also has a good section on the different types of goldfish and their particular needs. Most importantly, it is written in a style that the beginner can understand, because I have found some books are written over the heads of beginners. This book assumes nothing, so it is wonderful for those just starting out in this hobby. It is also apparent that the writer has a genuine affection for these creatures, which makes the information all the more meaningful."
3,"A good, informative book","This book has helped me gain an understanding of goldfish and how to take care of them. Written by Carlo DeVito with Gregory Skomal, it was released in 1996. The 156 pages consist of five chapters. The color photographs of the varieties of goldfish are nice. Several drawings are also included--one of these is a color drawing of a goldfish with its external features pointed out. Handy sidebars are interspersed throughout. Examples of topics discussed are the history of goldfish, the body and its structure, the senses, selecting goldfish, varieties, setup of the aquarium, plants, feeding, aquarium maintenance, breeding, diseases, and pondkeeping. There is an appendix, which is composed of an alphabetical listing of 80 well-known varieties of goldfish, and a bibliography. I find this to be a pleasing, useful publication and recommend it."
3,Good starter book,"I have kept goldfish in the past but i never felt like i knew how to care for them properly. So i got this book to get a basic idea about goldfish and their tank requirements. This book was helpful in explaining the various types of fish and the care that they need. Also, there are many nice and colorful pictures."
3,Not enough pictures about goldfish diseases,This book's just too general. The contents are just too basic. It doesn't contain too much info about goldfish diseases. I think the book contains info about general freshwater fishes rather than goldfishes. Also there're only a few pictures that shown the goldfish diseases. Some diseases written in the book don't even have pictures. I will say it's a book for a real beginner (knows nothing about freshwater fishes) rather than goldfish lovers.
2,there could have been so much more,"This CD was a disappointment. I was really looking for the oldest recordings of Piobaireachd that I could find, but this CD is mostly an audio recording of two guys talking about Piobaireachd. Perhaps it would be of more interest to someone more knowledgable about this type of music."
3,Are you a beginner?,"If you don't speak German than this is not the right product for you. I'm German and I bought this product for my fiance who doesn't know any German. It was very confusing and difficult for him to understand (if even). The lessons were read very fast, I even had a hard time sometimes following. If we used the slow-down pronunciation option, it sounded like a record player on the wrong speed. The only word by word translation was at the end (like a dictionary). And it didn't even have all the words that were used in the lessons.It might help you if you had taken German before and would want to refresh or deepen your skill."
1,Poor Program,"One star is too high; I wish ""Zero Stars"" was an option. I bought this program, installed it, and then uninstalled it. It did not take very long to figure out that it was a complete waste of time. First, it only wants to run in 640 x 480 or 1024 x 768 screen resolution. I run everything in 800 x 600, and I don't want to change just to accommodate a lazy programmer. Speaking of bad programming, the interface on this title is bad. I think it would have taken more time learning how to use the program than learning how to speak German. I'm returning this product, and buying another."
4,Speed will have you energized,At the begining i didnt know what to excpect but once getting into the movie i couldnt get off the edge my couch.This movie defintaly would have gotten a 5 star but i wasnt very impressed with the way Keana Reeves spoke his role.It was bland at some times.The excitement of the movie was great.Going through thcity steets down through the airport and ending up on the train.This movie has it all.I f you liked this movie i highly recommend fair game.It is a must have for any movie freak.
3,Speed,"Movie was excitng and action-packed, with a good cast. However, it was too long. It should have ended after the bus. There was no need to do it all over again on a train. That became very tiresome to me."
4,Great Non-Stop Action Flick!,"This is really good, as far as action movies go. Great characters, great pace, great sound, nice action-sequences and special effects. This is one of the best action movies of recent times, it really satisfies if you're looking for a non-stop adrenaline rush. If you like Keanu Reeves I recommend 'The Matrix', if you like Dennis Hopper I recommend 'Blue Velvet', and if you liked 'Speed' also see 'Die Hard'. From a scale of 1-10 I give it a 7!"
4,"WOW, 2 COOL",I loved this film a lot and even though Keanu reeves did well in the Matrix he is at his best in Speed. Packed with action and romance your heart will not stop pumping. The big plus??? Keanu's handsomeness of course!!!!
3,Picture quality may disapoint you,"If you have seen Planet Earth in HD, this movie will disapoint you in terms of picture quality. Don't get me wrong, it's better than a upscale 1080p DVD.I guess technology is not there yet to convert old movies compared to the ones that were shot in HD format originaly.Sound is good, DTS HD at 1.5Mb but not PCM 5.1 which is at 6Mb.If you always push for the best quality and sound this movie is not for you.If you are a fan buy it."
3,Excellent thriller except for the last 20 minutes,"This is an excellent thriller. Except for the last 20 minutes, the logic is generally ok (though why does one cop deliberately shoot another?). The camera work is good (not too much blurring and shaking of the camera). The characters are likable. Great stunts. Quite enjoyable.The last 20 minutes nearly ruin the whole thing. The plot becomes illogical and absurd. That's where the movie lost a star on my ratings."
2,This movie is not so good,"It starts out with good potential, but then becomes far fetched - to say the least. They defy the laws of physics - there's no way a bus would make a jump like that. In fact no vehicle can jump from a flat surface with no type of ramping. And can a bus take those corners at 50 or greater without tipping. I think not.They should've let the lady in the elevator in the beginning die, or at least loose her legs for hesitating so long.If you can overlook such ridiculous scenes, then the movie isn't half bad. It's worth seeing, but not worth owning."
3,Relax and enjoy action,It's a good film if you like adrenaline and don't discuss too much its realness. And it comes out of common action movies.
3,I thought that the movie was exciting and fun,This movie was great and exciting. It had a whole bunch of suspence. I liked the part wher they jumped over the bridge and thay barely made it. I also liked it when every time they tought they had the bad man he would escape from them.
3,"Keanu Reeves ""lives up"" to his poor reputation.","Reeves seemed to be on depressants the entire movie--the hostages on the bus were far more entertaining and talented than he ever was in this film. I'm still aghast at how utterly terrible Reeves' acting was. It defies all comparison, explanation, and comprehension.I felt immensely sorry for Bullock, having to kiss him and all. Ewww. I can't believe how popular this movie was."
4,Great Movie,Great Action... Looks awesome on Blu-ray.. This is a must have for all you action lovers. Explosions are amazing in 1080p
4,Wow!,"Talk about a WILD RIDE! Action, explosions, suspense, mystery, twists, turns, surprises, chemistry, romance, its got it all!!! You'll be very surprised Keanu and Sandra have not worked together again until The Lake House (which is great too!) A mad bomber has started a spree and specifically drags in Keanu to try and catch him if he can. Excellent movie!"
3,Didn't age well,"SWAT officer Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves) must face off against a mad bomber (Dennis Hopper) who has rigged a city bus to explode if its speed falls below 50 mph. When this film was first released, I was as caught up in the action as anyone and easily forgot the absurdity of the plot. Upon a recent reviewing, however, I found that it just didn't hold up for me. I couldn't overlook how silly the basic concept is, and the stereotyped characters and dialogue grated on my nerves. Nevertheless, director Jan DeBont deserves credit for taking this idea farther than anyone else could have./"
3,Speed Still Thrills: Pomo Porno,"I don't know the meaning of the word, ""post-modern"", but I like the fact that its abbreviation (Pomo) looks an awful lot like Porno.I bought the DVD for a much closer look at Joss Whedon's uncredited dialogue and came away with a new awareness of the film's plot holes and irrational construction, most of which are pointed out (nearly celebrated) by Graham Yost and Mark Gordon on the second commentary.It's that commentary track that makes this purchase valuable to me, beyond the very interesting camera operation and the peculiarities of story.Yost and Gordon self-dissect this film in ways that illustrate the processes and creative decisions that lead an action-audience to a desired end, which is also an adequate working definition of pornography.Curiously, even after the post-mortem, Speed still thrills. Go figure."
4,Good all round action movie with good build ups of suspense!,"To start with, the film seems to be kind of slow but this changed dramatically after the first action scene. In our opinion this was good because it built up suspense really well this is helped by the music which compliments all the scenes well. well there you go I ran out of ideas seeya later!!"
3,Speed (Five Star),"Whoever at Fox Home Video organized this DVD set forgot to put the DTS digital soundtrack on. I knew something was wrong when I didn't see the DTS trailer at the beginning of the movie. Please FOX, go back and put DTS back on Speed."
3,The bus should have left without Sandra,"SPEED delivers first-rate excitement. But every time this film approachs true greatness, it takes a break to build the relationship between Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock. If it were your life in danger, would you be thinking about dating? To see how SPEED could have been done right, get THE TAKING OF PELHAM ONE TWO THREE starring Walter Matthau and not starring any girls!"
3,It was entertaining and fun.,I liked this movie because it was entertaining and fun. I liked the part where they jump the bridge where a big part of it was not on. I also liked that the bad guy always played tricks on them and when they tought they had him he got away.
3,I think that this movie was fun and entertaining.,"This movie had a whole bunch of suspence. It was good because everytime they tought they had the guy, he just tricked them. I also liked the part where the bus jumped over the empty space in the highway. I also liked it because it was a movie where I never even got a chance to blink."
2,Doesn't work for me,"There a few basic rules that movies must follow to create some sense of reality (such as the laws of physics) that the director of Speed has disregarded. I will give him credit, however, for taking a storyline that is thinner than a strand silk and squeezing out a 1 1/2 hour movie. The low point is the last scene when Sandra Bullock has somehow survived a gigantic train wreck handcuffed to handrail without getting her hands ripped off and she and Keanu Reeves calmly enjoy a long kiss and talk about all the great sex they are going to have. This pathetic last-ditch effort to try to create a storyline made me gag.If you are looking for action videos that build some suspense and even have a few laughs, get an of Arnold Schwarzenegger's movies. They are all better than Speed."
4,What a ride!,"I saw bits and pieces of this movie a few years ago, and didn't think much of it. Last night I watched it all the way through for the first time. What a ride!I love the chemistry between Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves. Both their characters were so heroic and caring - what a great example!The movie was just plain on-the-edge-of-your-seat action. It was fast, it was exciting, it was fun.There wasn't a lot of cussing, but there were several bloody scenes. It wasn't nearly as gory as most similar kinds of movies are, however, which I appreciated.This isn't going to change your life, but it's certainly a fun few hours."
5,Thrill packed movie,"This is simply a great action movie and should definately be added to your collections. Speed 1 and 2 were both thrill packed, exciting movies with adventure, romance and of course a whole lot of ""What do you do Jack, what do you do!"". Definately a movie worth watching multiple times, and a great one for a surround sound enviroment for many home theaters enthusiasts. I loved it and plan to purchase Speed 2 on here as well (I was going to get the two pack collection, but Speed 2 wouldn't have been widescreen if I recall correctly)."
5,This is one of the best action-movies!,"I really love this moviebecause of the plot, the acting and the stars. I recommend this movie to everyone. This is my favourite action movie."
5,Wait for the new FIVE-STAR COLLECTOR'S EDITION.,"If you're wanting to purchase the SPEED films, wait till July 30th and get the new FIVE STAR COLLECTION versions of these films. Newly enhanced anamorphic widescreen versions along with DTS and Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtracks. Plus loads of extras. SPEED 2 will also be released as well in the new format, but won't be a Five Star Collection. However both films will be available as a boxed set."
4,SPEED,"Thewhole movie is action and adventure all the way through.From begenning to end ,once you start watching you want wanttostop! You want even want to take abreak the movie is so intense it, will have you on the edge of your seat."
5,Speed,"The storyline is simple and great. There is never a dull moment is this movie. The director did a great job in casting Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock as screen couple. This movie still manage to glue me down to my seat even after ten years of production. It is a ""must-have"" for any good moives collector."
3,Overpriced ?,"I'm really excited that FOX is finally releasing some of it's catalog titles on Blu-Ray. But these titles are exactly that catalog titles, that are priced higher than most studios day and date releases. The picture and sound quality are on par with Sony / Warner Bros. / Paramount / Disney, not any better or worse. The ""extras"" are sorely missing. I'm really getting tired of certain studios setting up for the ""double dip"" by not including the basic extras from their dvd couterparts. Yes, I did purchase this movie, but I feel cheated having to pay this much to enjoy Speed in Hi-def, when M:I:3 looks a lot better, is packed with features, and costs less. Come on Sony, Fox, & Disney step up your Hi-def game."
3,"Great action, hokey subplot","This movie is justifiably famous for its nonstop action sequences, which are carefully filmed, directed and edited. I admit to being on the edge of my seat at many points. Dennis Hopper is, as usual, over the top in his role as a psycho former cop using terror as a way to get money he thinks is coming to him as compensation for injuries. We like to see Dennis in this type of role; we expect it, and thus are not disappointed. The supporting cast is good. Reeves and Bullock, around whom the subplot of a developing love relationship centers, probably do as well as they can with their lines. Bullock seems more at ease. Reeves seems a bit wooden. But the love subplot struck me as incredibly corny; it was extensive enough for me to dock the movie a couple of stars in the rating."
3,The bus should have left without Sandra,"SPEED delivers first-rate excitement. But every time this film approaches greatness, it takes a break to build the relationship between Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock. If it were your life in danger, would you be thinking about dating? To see how SPEED could have been done right, get THE TAKING OF PELHAM ONE TWO THREE starring Walter Matthau - and not starring any girls!"
4,Love it,"This is a great action flick to sit back, relax and enjoy. Does it explore the great expanse of the human existence? No. It's just great fun. And, in response to an earlier review, if I was in danger aboard the bus, yes, I would be thinking about dating Sandra Bullock!"
1,Unintentionally hilarious,"This movie is excellent - if you don't realise that it is supposed to be serious. If you think that it is a parody of action movies then it is great. Reeves' over the top deep macho voice is hilarious, and the women all cry and panic whilst the men all say ""grrr"" and make smart-alec quips - think Brad and Janet in ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"". The characters are extremely shallow and unbelievable - one minute Bullock is freaking out, and the next she is coyly flirting with Reeves. If you want intentional hilarious parody then I'd recommend ""Rocky Horror"" instead."
1,Speed ...!,This movie is filled with action but is totally unrealistic! The movie should actually be considered a comedy because of the stuff that goes on. I wouldn't reccomend it.
1,I can't believe what I'm reading,"Speed? C'mon people, this movie stunk to high heaven. Good story, admitted, but the final product left me shaking my head. Keanu Reeve's acting was so bad, I wanted to stick my hand inside the screen and slap the little SOB. If there was an Academy Award for 'Ham', then I'd understand, but I don't think there is. Little boy trying to play a grown-up role is what it boils down to. Maybe he should have goton a few more chest hairs before he decided to do this.Next, there are 'serious' action movies and then there are the campy. Both are enjoyable, but they should never cross the lines with each other. Speed came off as trying to be serious, but fell flat a number of times. I would eat my own boogers on national TV for two hours if ANYONE could get a bus to make that jump."
2,Keanu is #1,"A mildly entertaining action thriller. The acting and directing are rather poor, but the action sequences make up for it. The worst thing about the movie is Keanu Reeves, who is probably the worst actor in Hollywood with George Clooney a close second."
1,Hated it,"I absolutly dispise this movie! I saw it when I was like 9 years old. I remember the whole time sitting there goin ""GOD, this movie ..."" The action was very poor I thought. I hated all the characters & there was no plot. The plot was a guy was blowing things up! Thats a stupid plot. The only good performance was Jeff Daniels & Dennis Hopper i Think. But there were no good relationships between the charachers. I know a lota people really liked this movie, but trust me, there are action movies 20 times better than this!"
1,"Bad Acting, Stereotypical, unrealistic diaster-movie stunts","I just finished watching this movie on VHS 15 minutes ago. It was very difficult to sit through the whole thing. The acting was bad, the characters were 2D; it was like a bad made-for-TV diaster movie. I think Keanu Reeves was fantastic IN THE MATRIX. But I am suprised he was given a lead again with this movie in his portfolio. I should add that the camera work was good. But the music was awful (like Casio keyboard sequences). And the dialog was just cheesy. I am honestly shocked that this movie did so well at the box office, even among respected critics, and still gets good reviews here. I think 10 or so years from now, people will look back and wonder what in the world they were thinking when they praised this movie. Awful, shallow, canned, trite, forced, devoid of even the pretense of reality. It reminded me of Con-Air. Same kind of hoakiness, but at least Con-Air had a protagonist with some depth."
1,Worst Movie EVER,"Did you ever actually sit down and watch this movie, it's ridiculous. It's not believeable at all, a large city bus could not jump a gap in a 50 foot gap in a bridge at 70 miles per hour. That may be cynical but it's the truth. Anything to get attention to the films poor acting and horrible plot line. The only thing that saved it (and not by much) was Dennis Hopper, but I don't understand what he was thinking by being in such a terrible movie. I find it sad that this movie actually became a blockbuster hit, and so much so that they decided that there must be a sequal to it. I don't know who made that decision but there should never have even been a first one. If I'm wrong and you like this movie more power to ya, but if you have never seen this movie...go get something better, anything better please...don't waste your time...I know this movie isn't suppose to be a work of art...so you be the judge...but I'm sure I'm wrong"
5,Beautiful,"iTunes didn't have this album for some reason, so I had to purchase the CD. I'm glad I did. The songs are wonderful and the artwork is beautiful. This is another wonderful Nightwish album. I'm one of those people that likes both Tarja and Nightwish. I think this was one of Tarja's best, besides Oceanborn (my favorite of all time). Bless the Child and End of All Hope really stand out to me as the best songs on the CD."
3,Kinda dark...,"This is a good album, but it's kinda dark for me. I gues that's kinda silly to say since Nightwish's whole thing is to be dark and all that. I mean, there are some songs I like on here, like End of All Hope or Oceanborn, but there are a few where the lyrics are just too much for me, or where they start screaming (I'm not a fan of that).I think the album as a whole is ok, but I'm sure there are many out there who consider it a work of art. If you like gothic, screamy music, then you will definately like this album. I like Nighwish because they infuse classical, opraish music with their hardcore metal. It's really cool, but sometimes it's a bit too much..."
5,ONE OF THE BEST NIGHTWISH ALBUMS!,I RECOMMEND THIS TO ALL NIGHTWISH FANS! TRUST ME YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED! BEAUTIFUL FROM TRACK 1 TO TRACK 15! THIS ALBUM IS A COMPLETE WORK OF ART! :D
4,"A different sound for Nightwish, but just as beautiful!","This album by Nightwish, although not quite as powerful as their Oceanborn release- still packs a punch with it beautiful symphonic ballads. No other band can match how beautifully they blend symphonic elements with metal. Therefore, this album is not worse than there other albums, but different in style. I love their new flavor of music. The rendition of ""Phantom of the Opera"" was pulled off just as easy as you would expect a band like Nightwish to do. ""Ocean Soul"" is my favorite song on the album, as it blends the most beautiful vocals with awesome guitar. Buy this and buy Oceanborn, you need both."
4,"Not as good as their other stuff, but amazing, just the same","This one isn't as good as Wishmaster. Granted I only own Wishmaster and Century Child. Soon will be buying Once, and all the rest that I need, to complete my Nightwish collection.Though, even though it only has 4 stars....it has my favorite song by them on it. Ever Dream. A MUST LISTEN. This song kind of starts off slow, very beautiful singing, and then just gradually expands and explodes in your face towards the end. I was literally in tears while listening to the track.The rest of the songs are good. The begininning 2 blend together, and are amazing in themselves.If you like power metal, but want something different, you know, a GIRL singing, this is it. This might just be what you are looking for."
3,Short and to the Point,"Nightwish's novelty is starting to ware off. If you've heard Wishmaster, there's really no need to own this album. You'll be avoiding male vocals, although quite good, just don't fit. Their new bass player should stick to just playing bass.Their song writing style is becoming generic and predictable. The beauty of their ballads is the only thing that keeps me buying their albums. Sad but true."
4,"Nightwish : ""Century Child""","**** - FOUR STARS==================In all honesty, Nightwish is not one of my favorite bands. I took a chance on buying ""Oceanborn"", and highly disliked it. It was too much opera, and not enough Metal for my taste, that's just me...As for ""Century Child"", I had read several reviews stating it was much heavier than previous Nightwish releases. Well, needless to say, being the huge Lacuna Coil fan that I am, I took a second chance on Nightwish hoping to hear improvement....I did. I heard alot of improvement, and most importantly, a heavier sound with less opera tones. That was enough for me. I'm impressed with ""Century Child"", and I can only hope that Nightwish continues this trend. The ""Oceanborn"" one is too boring for me. I prefer this style much more. It just fits better in my opinion. Great buy, and well worth a listen....LACUNA LEGIONS FOREVER"
3,If this is Nightwish then where's Tarja?,"Only get this album if you are a hard core Nightwish fan and you're doing it just because you love everything thay've done because this is not Tarja best stuff(Partly because you hardly hear her sing by herself!). They've really toned down the opera style vocals from Tarja and the only good song is 'End of All Hope'. Don't get me wrong this album is probably not as bad as I'm making it sound. It's just that I read the criteria for 3 stars and found that the definition is 'worth buying'. The thing is, it's not really worth buying. I've had to import may of their other albums and pay a lot for importing fees on sites like amazon.com but it has all been worth it. This album is the only Nightwish album that I bought and then sold it was that bad."
4,notice to A KIDS REVIEW,yea man.....i'll go listen to nickelback instead when u list nickelback on that list that means you don't deserve the right to list those other bands...disgrace to layne and mudvayne and all the others. please don't listen to foreign music ever again you don't deserve to.
3,Where are Leo and Kate?,"It was strange, I was listening to this music, namely the track Forever Yours, and I suddenly felt as though I in a movie theater about 7 years ago, watching a movie about a giant sinking boat called Titanic. This song rips of the theme of that movie so closesly its laughable. Of course there is a little variation but its practically like listening to ""My Heart Will Go On"". In the little flute solo you can really hear it, so funny, its even at a similar point in the song. hahahaha"
3,almost good,"If your looking for the sound of sonata arctica,symphonyx,dreamtheater you wont find it here! This is a symphony orchestra,opera mix without any good guitar work.This cd could be good if the guitarist had any balls to play.Maybe he just cant!"
2,Major Letdown,"What is up in Finland? Stratovarius bombs with ""Elements part I"" and now this? I expected so much more from Nightwish. Alas... the previous 2 releases were so majestic and original. This is trying to be the same but as many have mentioned already, Tarja's soraing vocals have been toned down quite a bit and the new bassist, Marco (ex Sinergy-- he should've stayed put!) tries to sing as well and it's absolutely horrible! To me there's a few gems on the album, ""End of All Hope"" a classic more in the ""Wishmaster"" vein, ""Slaying the Dreamer"" quite good until the final few minutes when Marco ruins it and the epic ""Beauty of the Beast"" is actually quite cool and probably the only thing that will stop me from selling this slab of plastic to a pawn shop. Hehe! I recommend this only to the hardcore Nightwish fans. For fans of true metal or power metal... go with the new leaders Lost Horizon!"
5,Nightwish Century Child,Night Wish Century Child is one of the great missing sound...which hard to find.If you are a real hard fan of Nightwish.
