3,"Good for bathrooms, may fall out when unplugging things","This product is good for bathrooms where you need a lot of plugs, and you don't plan to plug and unplug things often. But if you need to plug and unplug things often, you might not like this product because there is no screw hole in the middle to keep the product in place. When you unplug something that is tight, then it might pull the whole surge protector out."
2,sloppy fit,"from the pic, it looks as if it had a center screw to affix to the wall plate. but, in fact it does not and so when removing plugs the whole device comes away from the wall outlet. it has a sloppy fit and needs to have a screw to secure it to the wall plate,"
1,Pretty Bad CD,Not much to say except that a friend of mine was weeding out his CD collection and gave me all the stuff he no longer wanted. This was one of the CDs he gave me. I can understand why he no longer wanted it. It's pretty bad. Sorry. It just is.
1,PETER LAW IS NO MUSICIAN,"I actually listened to this album twice to give Mr. Law the benefit of the doubt. Yet, the second listen was more excruciating than the first. The guy can't sing and his playing is very mediocre. There actually should be a ""law"" against Peter Law releasing another CD. This album is genuine garbage. Hope he doesn't quit his day job. I'm sure (at least I hope) he's a nice guy, but sorry, he's no musician."
2,Print too small to read,Had I known the print was so small i would never have ordered this book. Even with my glasses I could not read it so I had to buy another with larger print. Wasted money.
3,Not fresh,"Many of the bars in this shipment were somewhat dry and crumbly. I've ordered this particular product 3 times; however, this is the first time I've experienced this problem."
3,Finishing This Book is an Exercise in Will Power,"I was listening to W. Clement Stone's The Success System That Never Fails (which was disappointing...the author read it and sounded drunk). Stone said this book changed his life.So I read this book. It does look like it can change someone's life, if you go through the exercises--the best part of the book. All the rest of the book is the author waxing rhapsodic about the wonders of will, starting each chapter with a poem written by the author. I'm sure it seemed clever 50 or 100 years ago.Anyway, all three stars go to the exercises. I can now make passersby fall down just by willing it."
5,Track Listing,"I hate it when there's no track listing for a cd you are considering buying. It was not here, so I did a bit of research and found it.1. Lucky Love (Frankie Knuckles Classic Club Mix)2. Lucky Love (Vission Lorimer Funkdified Mix)3. Lucky Love (Amadin Mix)4. Lucky Love (Lenny B's Club Mix)5. Lucky Love (Armand's British Nites Mix)6. Lucky Love (Acoustic Version)Hope it helps!"
2,Lee Hits us again with the polemics,"Once again, Spike Lee hits us again with the polemics. Overall, the story is not bad. The basic idea of a bus ride to the MMM is a good one. SOME of the characters are nicely drawn, such as Charles Roc Dutton's bus driver, Ossie Davis as the patriarch, and the caring father of the wayward son. But the film is weighed down by Spike Lee's usual soapbox dialogue and polemics. Sadly, few of the characters in this film actually talk, they make speeches (as is the case with ""The Red Menace"" and ""Putney Swope)."" Like I said, the story itself is good and the above-mentioned characters are nicely drawn. But the dialogue? Go to the soapbox on 125th St. in Harlem as the Black nationalist pontificators pound the podium and you get the idea."
1,This was the most horrible film I have ever sat through.,"This film was awful. It only serves to perpetuate racial stereotypes, especially carefully veiled, negative opinions regarding whites. The dialouge between the gay black man and the white Jewish bus driver was unbearable. This film accomplished nothing, and it certainly contributes zero to racial harmony in North America.Whatever your race, if you come across this movie, do yourself a favor and don't watch it."
3,Powerful but flawed,"The stereotypical treatment of non-Black characters in the film (the Jewish bus driver, the White cops) undermines its credibility.Spike provides us with a valuable look at the varied perspectives and values of Black men today. The film is always interesting and engaging although there is a lot of speechmaking and little resolution of any of the subjects it deals with (for us or the characters in the film).This film is well worth watching but it could have been a whole lot better."
3,Nice pen but . . .,"I received this pen as a gift and I love the body of the pen. It's sleek, classy, well-built and well-balanced. The pen writes nicely with high-quality gel ink. HOWEVER, Cross only offers refills for this pen in one size - medium. This is terribly frustrating for me since I prefer a very fine point pen. The line of the pen is simply too broad for my taste and the 3rd party fine-point refills I've tried (Foray and Montverde) are terrible. Thus, I'm stuck with a pen I really like that I just don't use.I would not recommend this pen to anyone who prefers writing with a fine point(or smaller). That said, if you like a medium point pen, this is a good choice."
5,Great looking pen,The pen is really great looking. The chrome pen with gold accents make this an extremely good looking pen.
3,Planet Pop!,"This multi national group, with members from The Netherlands, Italy and New Zealand will defenitely make your feets move. ""Around The World"" and ""My Heart Beats Like a Drum"" were both catchy uptempo songs with a influence from 90's Eurodance, apart from Eiffel 65 they had more lyrics but still the happy meliodic sound as them, ATC is a quartet with 2 girls and 2 boys, the girls sings most of the songs that were single released but the guys also appear in some. ""Why Oh Why"" and ""Thinking Of You"" were also single released, but both slower then the top hits. ""Notte D'Amore Con Te"" got the hook in Italian, If I'm not mistaken Enrique Iglesias also recoreded the song. There are 18 songs on this album which is a bit too many, not all of them are that good, However there are plenty of cheesy Euro-Dance songs here that won't make you dissapointed. Not all songs sound like ""Around The World"" though, many ballads for example. A good album nonetheless that could be worth picking up."
1,Don't waste your money on this album,"This is the first CD I have bought in several years, and I'm so disappointed. Don't waste your money on this CD... most of the tracks are ""rip-offs"" from other artists and their styles. The track ""My heart beats like a drum"" is definitely ""dumb dumb dumb"" because it's a complete rip-off from their own hit single ""Around the world."" Other tracks sound similar to the styles of other hit artists (i.e. N'SYNC, Backstreet Boys, Enrique Iglesias, No Doubt, just to name a few). If you have the money to waste, go ahead and buy this CD, but personally, I don't feel that the music is worth the cost of the material that the CD is made of (if that makes sense)."
2,Not worth it.,"I have to admit that after I've heard ""around the world, lalalala"", I became a ATC fan, I just can't get enough of it on the radio. Then the CD was released, I got myself a copy right away, after listening to it, I was very disappointed.Whether you agree with me or not, but 90% of the music on the CD are basically sound the same, just with a lyrics change, and called a new song... so the bottom line is if ""around the world"" is the only reason you buy this CD, then get the single since there are remix of it there..."
2,A touch of crass.,"Didn't the music biz learn anything from the Milli Vanilli fiasco? As the CD liner notes reveal in tiny print, the cute young faces on the cover are not the people who sang the vocals. Considering that the studio vocalists aren't exactly Celine Dion or Brian McKnight, this is really sad. The presence of some sugary, synth-heavy Euro-pop-dance confections that owe more than a little to Abba, Aqua, and Robert Miles (""Around the World,"" ""Why Oh Why,"" ""Until,"" and ""Mind Machine"") does little to make up for the dishonest packaging, infantile lyrics, or the tepid attempts in the second half of the CD to ape the Backstreet Boys and Enrique Iglesias."
5,Planet Pop Indeed,"This CD kicks butt. I honestly thought I'd only be listening to ""All Around The World"" but I just love nearly every song on this CD. I kinda don't like ""Why Oh Why"" because it seems so eerie, and I especially like ""My Heart Beats Like A Drum,"" ""Until,"" and ""Mind Machine"". This CD really lives up to its title."
4,Fun Dance/Pop,"These lyrics aren't deep, emotional, or profound, but it is fun and happy. I liked the song ""Around the World"" for this reason so bought the whole CD. I love it and listen to it when I need cheered up. I like that song and also ""Until."""
1,Absolute Junk,"This is a great Cd if you like brilliant lyrics like ""La di di, la da da"", and other catchy childish words. It took absolutely no skill to write lyrics to this cd. All the songs sound akile and have the same music. Nothing clever."
2,ATC almost touched classy,"I would have to say that I bought this CD in anticipation of it being great. I had heard the Lalala song on the radio and scrambled to find this CD. I was excited the day I bought it, which soon turned to dismay when I found that pretty much the entire CD sounds the same. Especially numbers 2 and 3, lalala and the bells song. I thought I had put my stereo on repeat for a minute. The only songs I thought had any merit on the CD were numbers 11 (Mind Machine) and number 13. Otherwise, the only use I can find for the CD is playing as background music in my stereo when I'm getting ready to go out dancing. And even then it's ingratiating."
2,Cheesy Euro Fluff,"I must admit that I like the first single from this album ""around the world"", otherwise this album would get 1 star. That first song is upbeat and hypnotically catchy, no matter how vacuous and generic the lyrics and instruments are. After that however, there is almost nothing new or interesting on the album. Generic, repetitious, mediocre - all of this and more. Granted, it fits right into a genre that contains a great deal of these same features, but it's late in the game and somewhat tired as far as a musical offering."
2,Disappointing,"""Around The World"" is quite infectious and by far the best song on this cd. Most of the rest sounds like filler. ""My Heart Beats Like A Drum"" is likable, but still several notches below ""Around The World"". All the rest are, sadly, rather boring. I wanted this to be so much better than it is. I agree with an earlier reviewer's comments about all those ""La La Las"" and ""Dum Dums"". A few more actual lyrics would have been most welcome. On the plus side, the production quality is good as are the performances. Too bad most of the songs are not of the same caliber."
3,Explain to me again why you got me this album,"This album was a gift to me by my firend.She knew that I only liked 2 songs on the whole CD and she got the whole CD.After listening to all the songs I foound it to be rather BOGUS and hated it.I only liked ""Around The World"" and ""Why Oh Why"".Those were both ok songs but the rest were like on planet Saturn.Plus I have a little question for this group,When you meant ""Plant Pop"" which planet are you talking about Earth or Pluto?I'd really like to know which.I not quet sure if there a european band or something else but who ever it is they give the pop a bad name.All I have to say is Why oh why did I get this album??????????"
2,A Touch of Cr**,"ATC is supposed to stand for ""A Touch Of Class"" but if ever there was a mis-named group this is it. If this CD has class then George W Bush is a dynamic speaker. It has one memorable tune in ""Around The World"" and the rest is an exercise in mediocrity. This same sounding 'euro-pop' is just an excuse for song writers to churn out the same tune with different words and arrangements. Give it a miss, there are many more CDs out there in this genre that are much more worthy of your money. Try Steps, BBMak, or even Scooch who all have much more variety and energy than this coaster."
1,i like only one song!,"The Whole Cd Is Not Good because They Can't Repeat Another hit like ""Around the world"" because is a cover song .The Original Band That Produce That Song Was a Russian Band Call ""Ruki Vverh"" And the Song Was Call Pesenka .....is the same Thing ...ATC Only did an english version ."
5,EXCELLENT!,"A Great CD full of 18 tracks of fun! This is this group's first CD, and they need some polishing, but the buy is worth it just for ""Around The World."" The CD maybe kind of expensive, I suggest buying used."
5,Up and comming,"When I first heard their sound I fell in love. I came upon it by accident, and and I know that it was a gift sent from above. I enjoy it, and I think that they will do extremely well here in America. Good luck to you, and I hope to be seeing more of you in the future.-Josiah Pugh josiahpugh@hotmail.com"
2,not as good as you expect,"I bought this cd after hearing the track Around the World on the radio. I loved this song and thought it was great dance music. I bought the cd when it came out, but none of the other songs are half as good as Around the World. Other songs on this album have the same sound, but none are as sophisticated as the popular radio tune, and they make the album trashy. This cd is just another disc of euro pop, no different from any other European teen groups trying to make it big with mediocre music. If you like Around the World just buy the single and save your money for better dance music."
2,Dont be fooled!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I loved the first single, ""Around the world"" and I thought that the cd would be like that song. What did I find out?? THE CD WAS HORRIBLE. There is harldely any techno, like i assumed there would be some in there. The lady cant sing worth anything. So listen to a friends copy before you buy."
4,Planet Groove,I love the Planet Pop CD it definitely has a great mix of songs from ballads to dance tracks and even songs with latin flavor. It is one of the best europop albums I have heard in a long time. ATC proves talent and with their youthful energy we will be hearing a lot more from them. If you haven't yet definitely check it out!
4,Well worth the money,I have several of these now because they work wonderful. The quality is just as good as those which are double the price and more. Small enough for travel too.
4,"Worthwhile, but remember the author's New Age mindset","I used this book as one of my guides on a trip to Egypt, and believe it would be helpful to anyone who wants to understand what they're seeing there. It has good explanations of what you will see, and of the author's view of the significance of it. But you must keep in mind that the author takes Ancient Egyptian beliefs more seriously than most 20th Century Americans--Some of his ideas are a bit dotty by my lights. But he is fair and reasonably unbiased. The book format is tall, narrow, and thick--probably about as small as possible to get the information across, but still larger than ideal if you plan to take it into the field with you in Egypt. The size ends up not being totally satisfactory for either leisurely reading or as a field companion. Still the only book I'm aware of that makes a serious effort to be an ""on-the-spot"" companion for viewing Egyptian antiquities in a studious way."
4,for open-minded readers,"The author provides a historical overview of Ancient Egypt and the development of Egyptology (by Kircher, Napoleon, Champollion, and Schwaller de Lubicz among many people). The book covers Egyptian Religion as well as the major religious and funerary texts. Giza, the pyramids and the Sphinx are discussed as are Saqqara, Memphis, Dahshur, Abusir, Meidum, Akhetaten, Thebes, Abydos, Dendara, Esna, Edfu, Aswan, Abu Simbel and Alexandria. A section is dedicated to the content of the Cairo Museum. Included are 5 appendices - dynasties and kings; sphinx and pyramid; glossary; bibliography; and travel tips. Both orthodox and unorthodox views are dealt with in this book, whose emphasis is mostly on the art and architecture of Ancient Egypt. With black and white illustrations, it is recommended for the open-minded reader."
5,"Enhanced with maps, diagrams, and photos","Now in a updated and expanded new edition, John West's The Traveler's Key To Ancient Egypt continues to be the definitive guide to all of the sacred places of ancient Egypt. The ideal traveler's guidebook is enhanced with maps, diagrams, and photos to accompany the history and spiritual significance of Egypt's art, architecture, mythology, religion, and ritual practices. From the Pyramids of Giza to the Valley of the Kings, this traveler's guide reveals the hidden meaning of monuments, ancient city sites, as well as new research on the dating of the Sphinx. Travel tips include tour information, Nile cruises, what to bring and what to wear, shopping advice, as well as information on money, hotels, and restaurants. If you are planning a trip to the Land of the Pharaohs, beginning with a thorough perusal of John West's The Traveler's Key To Ancient Egypt!"
4,Very Comfy Sox,"These socks are very comfortable and fit my ladies size 9 (Euro 40) foot nicely. I'll be spoiled now for the cheaper socks I usually buy. The cushioning is superior to less expensive socks, and they don't get sweaty even on five mile walks in the heat of south Florida. The inside of the socks are very soft, too, compared to others in my drawer that feel like sandpaper. I'd give them five stars, but when left on for 8 or 10 hours as I often do,the compression gets a little tight, and vaguely uncomfortable. But would definitely buy more."
2,Doesn't Hold Up,"I've had this sprinkler for 2 seasons, and it did not hold up. Water sprays out from the base and middle, and it doesn't always oscillate back and forth. It stops at a tab and just sits there. When I first bought it, I was very pleased, but by the second year it seems to have just worn out. I wouldn't recommend this sprinkler, there are far better out there for less money."
4,Nelson gear drive sprinkler,I like this sprinkler. It is of good quality construction that should last for years. Typical circular pattern that is infinitely variable.
2,I'll pass on this one...,"Pros: Quiet operationGood coverageCons: If your hose delivers good water pressure to the sprinkler, the sprinkler consistently falls over.Does not shoot near as far as advertisedI am much happier with the Gardena sprinklers I purchased..."
3,A Naturalist's Guide to One Part of the Arctic,"This is an informative read, but not very practical for someone visiting the arctic of Europe or Asia. It's just about Canada and Greenland, although nothing in the title or description provides a clue of this. If you are visiting Svalbard,for instance, some of this information applies, but most of the book won't apply. You'll end up leaving the book at home."
2,"OK, for the money","I loved this collar for my puppy, BUT it didn't hold up and already looks ragged. If not worn very often, then this collar would be OK."
5,Very nice,Very impressed with this. For $20 you can't go wrong. Would make great centerpiece. Picture doesn't do it justice. The leaves have a bit of green to them (picuture makes them look black) - v nice.
5,Functional & Attractive,Great addition to the Napoli dinnerware set. Keeps bread warm and looks good.
2,Disappointed,"I really wanted to like this item; the picture looked so pretty. I did not expect it to be made in China. The leaves were poorly painted, plus they were smudged. I would pay $5.00, no more."
3,A litte disappointed,This bread basket is ok but larger than I wanted and also a little heavier. It just does not meet my needs.
4,USB Cable,What can I say? It's just a USB cable but it sure beats the heck out of paying 28$ at Best Buy.
1,one out of six,"I ordered 3 USB male to male cables because the price was more in line with what the item is than in office supply stores; even with the shipping I figured I was ahead. The cables came very promptly. However the drawbacks of online ordering came into play--two of the cables work fine and one connector on the third is fine, but the other end's connector is defective--there is plastic and or solder in it and it will not fit in the computer port so that the cable is unusable. A failure rate of one in six is not very good."
4,Hmmmm.....,"I'm not sure about the other reviewers here but I found this book very, very useful.I'm taking the online-acadamy and found the book supported the 3.0 curriculum very nicely. The hardcover book would go into greater depth and would aid in understanding. Reading online and following up by reading each chapter in the book really drove the concepts.I have heard horror stories about previous books and curriculum but I think this 3rd edition has addressed those...I gave 4 stars as the book does have some typos...I have read this book, cover to cover, and found maybe 5 (significant) errors - - most of which simply challenged my thinking and/or forced further reference; enhancing the experience.This book will serve you well as a Companion Guide to the CCNA 1 and 2 Online Curriculum."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK,"I finished the first CCNA class with the new 3.0 curriculum. It was a nightmare. Nearly every student was failing because they made the mistake of reading the book. We soon figured out that the book was useless in preparation for the academy tests. Cisco was ""worki8ng the bugs out"". One of the complaints I had was Cisco-last semester- would take one sentence from the book and have it on the test. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. If you are in the Cisco Academy, spend the money on ink and paper and print out the online curriculum, which by the way, is totally different than the book-more focused to the test objectives. The first few weeks of the new curriculum found several hundred students at my school near failing because of ""the bugs""."
3,"Version 3.1 of Online Academy due April, 2004??",Perhaps one should contact Cisco and see if they are upgrading the book to 3.1 to match the online Academy. I don't actually have book.. it can't hurt to have it but it does seem you can get by without it if you study dilegently the online material
4,Strong entry in House of Winslow series,"This was a good strong entry in the House of Winslow series and helped to make up for some previously weak entries. Erin Winslow who grew up in Africa searches for something more in her life. The character of Stephen is more of a plot device than an actual character, but Quaid is strong and well worth reading about. I would have liked more in depth about his struggle with alcohol though. Morris has finally learned to get the reader interested in the next book by introducing characters in this one. Amelia is an intriguing character and I looked forward to reading the next book in the series that focussed on her and her brother."
5,Classy and Functional,"I wanted to find an attractive, quality carafe that actually kept coffee hot . . . and this is it! Things I love about this carafe:*keeps coffee hot!*easy to use -- simple screw on cap, one handed dispensing (just press on tab with thumb)*lightweight but solid construction (I bumped it a couple times but with no adverse affects to the lining)*delicious design . . . sphere is so geometrically simple, and yet so pleasing to the eye*comes in an array of colors and finishes (tough to decide -- I chose the classy and modern frosted black)The number one reason that I love the idea of a carafe is that it keeps my coffee hot and fresh, with that ""just brewed"" taste (as opposed to leaving it in its brewing pot on the warmer, where it always seems to degenerate into scalded, yucky coffee after a few hours).I also find it useful for when I have company over, or for keeping at my desk so I don't have to run back to the kitchen for a refill.Love it, love it, love it!"
5,Rare comedy,"This book is simply hilarious. I read this book fifteen years ago in tropical Africa and I am yet to get over it. Clarence Day Jr. tells the story of his father in a very imaginative and hilarious manner. The peculiar genius of this book is how the author managed to present the character of his extraordinary subject in such an ordinary manner.After reading this book one has the sense of haven paid a visit to the Day family, rather than haven read a well written book about them. It is this rare quality of reality about the book that makes it my best comedy of all times."
2,Schlep tags,"The tags are cute and colorful, but not very durable. I don't think I noticed in the product description that they are one step above paper. They barely made it through our 10-day trip."
4,Rating for this CABLE,"Weird, Amazon is asking me how i rate this game and how fun it is.Anyway, as for this cable, I Was very pleased with it! It came all sealed up and with instructions and everything you need and more for it. It works just as it is suppose to and give great quality for standard definition."
5,S-Video Out improves picture quality,"I bbought this cable because I have my Xbox 360 hooked up to an older television that does not have an HDMI input. I had been using the component video cables that came with the Xbox 360 but the picture quality was poor. I noticed a marked imrpovement using the S-video cable in this product. The picture is not HD quality, but it is now easier to read text written on the screen and images overall look crisper."
4,"S-Video, Better than Composite","The S-Video does give you slightly better video quality than the normal red,white, and yellow cables. Remember, this still isnt an HD cable."
5,TV,"Friend dumped his old sony trinitron 36"" on me while he's out of country, so I got this cable to connect. Not as good as HDMI, but at least I'm connected!"
5,Product Worked,I ordered this cable for our son's tv which was not a HD so he could hook up his Xbox 360 worked as showed and we like the s video makes picture 100 % clearer and clean like never before.
4,Truth,This bbok gives the true history of the actual events. A must for researchers and pirate buffs.
5,Awesome and entertaining,"I love this series and can't wait for Season 2 to come out on DVD as well. The battles give map views, units involved and numbers, and brief summary of what led up to the battle. Yes there are some errors in the CGI films in terms of the tanks' details but they are still entertaining and give a good sense of what took place during the battles. The many veteran clips from all the different armies are a huge plus to give the individual soldier and personal perspective. After watching clips I found on youtube, I was sold on getting the DVD!"
5,A great straight foward teacher,"I read this book and was laughing and amazed at the same time to how a good organizer Ms.Rogers was.So to any woman who is having a hard time in getting organize about the difficulties of divorce; I will have tell you to read it and get the important advise. Meanwhile, since I'm not marry I don't have to worry about it, but if one day I am and my ""living fairy tale"" ends then I would not be clueless to what to do next, but to get my hands on this book."
5,Jeffery Osbourne,"Excellent CD...if you are a Jeffrey Osbourne Fan, you can't go wrong. He was LTD...and of Love Ballad the old classic is on this CD as well. A perfect gift or a nice way to unwind."
5,"Best ""Love Songs"" Collection Ever!","Jeffrey Osborne's ""Love Songs"" Collection is a compilation of 18 true love songs, guaranteed to please anyone with discerning taste. I discovered this collection on Amazon quite by accident, and after sampling the selections, wondered why I didn't own this CD. It is one of those CD's where there's NO song you want to skip while listening to it. I cannot even begin to determine which song is my favorite. Jeffrey's sultry, smooth voice will grab you from the very beginning. Turn the lights down low, close your eyes and get ready to enjoy. You can listen to this one over and over, all night long.I rated it five stars . . would've given it more if I could. The one and only missing factor from this CD is ""Stranger"", which is one of the most heartfelt love songs ever written. Couldn't quite figure out why that song was not included on this disc. Anyway, take my word for it, J.O.'s Love Songs will not disappoint . ."
4,Gots to love old school R&B,Jeffrey is one great singer and his R&B ballads are top! They give you a bit of him in the collection.
5,Love Songs,I have received what I have been looking for and it is satisfaction. I have added this cd to my collection and crossed it off my list.
5,Nice,"Very relaxing. They don't do music like this anymore. I was born in a wrong era I guess. But with the Greatest Hits, it is all good."
3,Cool CD,I really like Jeffrey Osborne. He has a wonderful voice and is great song writer. But I truly think he did his best with L.T.D.
1,Stay as far away from this as you can,"After struggling with the reliability of several Epson InkJet printers, I decided it was worth investing in what I thought was the high-end picture printer- the Sony dye-sub. After a couple weeks it wouldn't print and had to go back to Sony for a 6 week repair job. Now it works, but the print quality is horrible. The pictures are dull and the color is horrible. Background scenese are just blobs of color and there is no contrast whatsoever. If have since bought a Canon i560, which I intended to just use for day to day document printing. But I've compared the same picture coming from both and it is night and day -- the bubble jet that costs less and does more functions prints 2-3 times better. The pictures are sharp, the contrast is great, and the dullness does not exist. I'd suggest staying as far away from this Sony as possible -- it's a rip off and you can do MUCH better with a good Inkjet or Bubblejet."
1,"Excellent Quality Printing, But...","This printer does excellent, quality, professional printing but I cannot recommend purchasing it. Sony has changed the ink cartridge when they came out with the DPP-FP30 & the DPP-FP50 and no longer make the cartridge for this printer. If you purchase this printer, make sure you get a lifetime supply of ink cartridges before buying or you will find that the printer is useless."
1,"BEST PRINTER EVER, BUT NO RIBBONS AVAILABLE","Sony created a fantastic printer. The results are even better than the typical local chain drug store's services. However, Sony has DROPPED THE BALL and will no longer supply printer paper and their proprietary SVM series ribbons, so anyone with a printer of this series now owns a very expensive paperweight. Consequently, I recommend that nobody buy the new printer advertised here. Only Sony's proprietary ribbons and paper will work in the unit. I think we should flood Sony with angry calls, so they make the supplies available. Their number is 212-833-8000. Press 3 to dial by name, and key in ""Stringer"" (Howard Stringer is the President of Sony). Unfortunately, they will connect you to their Customer Relations team in Fort Meyers, FL but if they get enough complaints, maybe they will do something about it."
2,Product Good- poor customer service skills,"I liked the product, had to return it, could not, which is fine according to policyhowever, did not appreciate the way I was treated, will not purchase fromthis vendor, ever............"
2,Non Hardcore ECW fans stay away!,If your looking for an ecw reunion... it aint here. The wrestlers are there but for some reason the spirit just doesnt cross over. Mostly due to the poor quality of the dvd. And the wrestlers dont really give it their all.
1,Sad...,"If only I could give this event 0 stars.. This, this isn''t ECW, and never will be ECW.Hardcore Homecoming? This is the most blatant false advertising since the neverending story. This event as about as hardcoreas mash potatos night at the old folks home..so many flaws, so little time..Kid Kash hugging Hat Guy on his way to the ring, then picking a fight with him several minutes later.Joey Styles, and don''t get me wrong.. Joey is the man, he recycled a line, and used it on ONS. (See FBI entrance on ONS, and HH)And the thing that bugged me the most, all the editing.. I wasn't sure if I was watching Forever Hardcore, or Hardcore Homecoming.I won''t comment too much on the shape of the wrestlers there out of respect for what they did for the once great company of ECW.. But when Danny Doring is the most in shape guy there, you got some problems..Guys, and gals.. you want to seesome classic ECW please, I beg you.. either them buy them here, or go to your local video store."
2,Very superficial,"This book has 224 pages, more than 120 illustrations, and over 1200 entries. But all the subjects are treated very superficially. Most entries have very few lines (""Willian Marchal"" is given 21 lines, ""Oxford"" is given 16 lines, ""Knight"" is given 21 lines, ""Santiago de Compostella"" 12 lines, ""Gothic"" 11 lines, ""Romance"" 5 lines). Few photos are really interesting. It is very deceptive if you're looking for detailled information (although the bibliography is quite extensive). It is a useful book only as a introductory work destined for very beginners on the times & lives of the Plantagenets."
4,Lots of fun!,We had a blast putting this puzzle together and naming all the places and remembering the ones we had visited. It might have been better if the places were actually listed on the box... it would have added to it educational value.
3,Okay with some classics but otherwise...,"Way too cute. Something like their older stuff... like the karaoke classic Daite Hold On Me and their sweet ballad Furusato are great songs... as well as Summer Night Town and Love Machine... otherwise... what are they thinking?? As much as I love the Japanese culture, there are things that are way too cute for their own good."
1,Onyanko Club Cover band,"This whole act was already done 20 years ago. Popular Members would put out solo singles, make side group project, put out photo books, concert videos ect. Compare to Onyanko club, morning musume girls are 10X more uglier and has no singing talent whatsoever. This group also went down hill when they stated to adding more members (esp. Goto maki).Why don't they all graduate? Onyanko club only lasted two years, break up already. All the songs are written by some 35 year old gayish guy (his own band went bankrupt) but this guy should get 5 stars for his marketing Concept and strategy. He ovbiously targeted guys with no girlfriend, i've heard that they're really popular in the U.S. Anime geeks with case of yellow fever just adore this group. They're paying $50.00 for this garbage. That is just beautiful..."
3,"Good stuff inside, too small.",I have a cervical version of this which works great. The stuff they put inside stays cold and really helps. This is really for small spots on your body. It is probably good for small bumps and bruises. But I think in general you want a pack as big as possible.
5,Such a fantastic Show.,"I am so glad that Season 2 of The Amazing Race made it to DVD. I have both seasons 1 adn 7, and I'm glad I can add this to my collecion.This is such a great show, and works on so many levels. First, it's a great show. It has a lot of suspense on who will come in where. I also like how the teams interact with each other. Will got on my nervest a lot, but it's so much fun to root agansit him. :O) I also love the different locations that they visit. The places are so beautiful. It's just amazing to see the clear, crisp blue waters, and the impressive sand dunes. I also like seeing teh different cultures, and see how other peopole live.Another plus to the show is that this is a family show, even chidlren can enjoy it. There isn't any profanity, or blood, or any other violence. Honestly, it's kind of refreshing to see it.If you've have seen the other seasons, then this one isn't a let down. If you haven't seen thsi show, then you need to get it. I can promsie you won't be sorry."
5,Truly amazing,"So glad that I received a working copy before it went out of stock. As far as the quality of the video and audio is concerned, it's good but not great. That doesn't really does not matter since this is the one DVD that makes me take the DEEP PLUNGE for the 55 inch LED TV and blu-ray player. Well worth it on the largest screen to see the part in Australia and New Zealand.This season is truly amazing compared to the later ones. The action is really fast paced toward the end with tons of twists and turns. Without revealing the ending, the two hours finale is definitely a NAILBITER!I wish CBS can release more of this AMAZING show, my favorite reality series. Currently only three seasons are available. Truly blessed to have the last few working copies before it went out of the stock! DON""T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITHOUT IT!!!"
4,More Continuing Series...,Thank you so much to Create Space for picking up where they left off so many years ago with series like this one and Survivor.Great season. Great quality. I'll keep buying them if they keep making them...
1,Where are the last three episodes????,"So I see all these 5 star reviews here on Season 2 of The Amazing Race, but apparently this is just ""part one"" and it's missing the last three episodes of the race. And yet, in 33 reviews, not one person bothered to mention that??? I am absolutely furious. What is the point of watching the season and not be able to see who actually WON the race???This was a complete waste of money, in my opinion. I'm really angry."
2,Feels like a bit of a swindle,"I instantly ordered this the moment I saw it because I was anxiously awaiting another season of The Amazing Race other than 1 and 7 to be given the full DVD treatment. However, this is not what this DVD is - it is only the episodes, nothing more. I feel as if whomever made it, Amazon, CBS, producers, whatever, were preying upon hard core fans' hunger for this release.I am very, very disappointed with my purchase."
5,Best show on TV!,"Amazing Race is the best show on TV. We wait with anticipation each new season. We have purchased the only seasons available 1, 7 and now 2. Sure wish they would release the rest of the seasons on DVD. My husband can't wait to see this show."
5,Double Trouble is BACK!!,"This album is AWESOME! I have had it for about 2 weeks now and love every track on it. Lots of guest appearances by some of the BEST in Rock and Blues. The diversity of this album is the key here. One of the best albums in recent memory. The standouts are Rock and Roll, Turn Towards The Mirror, and Ground Hog Day. If you are a fan of the of Rock'n Blues than this ablum is definetely for you!"
1,"Uh huh, so what?","The concept of bringing on a lot of different people to record a blues inspired album may not be the worst idea, but in this case it doesn't work. My impression is that the people involved just came around the studio for an hour or two and did their part. The result is quite uninspired and to be frank - boring. There are so many better albums in this genre, so I strongly advise you to skip this one. I bought this album on sale, got home and listened to it a couple of days, and just realized that I would never play it again."
3,Double Trouble is in Trouble,"My second hearing of ""Been a Long Time"" tempered my initial disappointment with this album, but only as far as a couple of the rockers go. For example, Malford Milligan's vocal on ""Cry Sky"" is tentative and weakened by the louder instrumentals, but he rebounds nicely on Skyscraper. The group would do nicely to skip the ballads and stick with their edgier, bluesier hard stuff. Sad to say, by far the best cuts on this CD are those by Jimmie Vaughn and Lu Ann Barton, Susan Tedeschi, and Dr. John. The album offers only ten cuts, including those of the ""guests"", indicating a dearth of the band's material. As it is, what was included is obviously a stretch."
3,As diverse and promising...,"...the guest list of this recording may be, I sadly come to the conclusion that this CD is a disappointment for me, which does not mean, that this can't the perfect modern-blues CD for someone else. I call it the Post-Stevie-Ray-Vaughan-crisis. Jimmie Vaughan - I loved his guitar playing when he was still in The fabulous Thunderbirds, I hesitate to put him down, but I think he's not developing into the ""right"" direction somehow - that goes only for my taste of course. Well, nuff said, the songs just don't convey the right feeling for me.Nils"
2,Double Trouble without SRV? I'm afraid so..,"Well, let's start by saying this album is OK. That's it. It's just OK. It doesn't even stand a chance against SRV's albums like The Sky is Crying and In Step. Sounds to me a bit like Double Trouble wanted a SRV sound but with new millenium blues. Sorry guys, but Tommy Shannon and Chris Layton aren't very good at it. They should stick with contempory blues.Albums by Tommy Castro or Scott Holt are contemporary blues, kind of like this, but a lot more well done. Hey Double Trouble-listen to Tommy Castro's ""Right as Rain"" and see some real 2000 blues. I liked these guys better with SRV. And BTW, the Susan T. parts of this CD are horrible, she has a lack of soul and it's as if she has no respect for SRV. Some songs are ok, but no one can replace Stevie."
2,I just don't get it,"Let's start of by saying that words can't describe how much I admire Chris Layton and Tommy Shannon. That being said, this is more of a concept than an album, and the playing of the former SRV rhythm section is pushed so far back in the importance and style here that it's impossible to figure why they're even on the cover! This is simply a Storyville CD with a different name on it. Storyville sounded nothing like SRV; more like watered down blues/rock, which led to their predictable demise. So why recreate the mediocrity? The problem here is an INCREDIBLE lack of soul shown by most of the artists here, especially (incredibly) Susan Tedeschi and Kenny Wayne Shepherd; thank goodness for Doyle Bramhall's contribution. Slick beyond belief, ""Been A Long Time"" is a CD you'll buy, play once, and never listen to again--and that's really a darn shame. If this is the best the comptemporary blues scene has to offer we all are in big trouble."
1,Save your money...this album is truely awful!,If you like SRV....forget this album. If you like blues...forget this album. If you like rock...forget this album. In short...forget this album. What a disappointment. Sounds like a rushed out compilation of junk produced solely to take money from unsuspecting SRV fans. Boo!
3,Not great; not bad!,"This book contains a good number of classic Beach Boys songs. THe selection is certainly decent. The voicings/harmonies contained in the piano section at times are great, but at other times somewhat lacking. A couple of songs have some wrong chords, i.e. not what you hear on the recordings, and some songs are presented in abbreviated format so you can't really play them all the way through as is done on the original recordings. There is enough satisfaction in this collection to make it worthwhile, but a somewhat more thorough and faithful representation of the songs would be very desirable. There is another way to go, namely a CD-ROM compilation of their songs that you can print out ONCE per song, but you can change the key it prints out in, etc. I have no idea if that one is any better but I may check it out myself!"
5,My first venture into Red Green's world and thoroughly enjoyed it.,Had these dvds recommended by a friend that had brought the complete set for his father. Will certainly order more in the future. Had many laughs along the way.
5,A favorite in our household!,"My husband and I first rented this show in our first year of marriage. I was familiar with Red Green, but it was all new for my husband. Six years later, he's still quoting the show (especially the bit about ""look OVER her shoulder to watch ""Jeopardy!""). I gave it to him this year for Father's Day and he was really excited. He shared it with his sister and her husband, and they also loved it. Once he brought it home, I finally got to watch it again, and my 4-year-old decided to sit in and HE started laughing. I'm not sure he knows what he's laughing at, but he loves the ""Men and Cars"" special and laughs when he sees the Handyman Corner spots and all the duct tape.So basically, people of all ages can enjoy this program, and there's nothing obscene and any innuendo is mild and discreet, so you don't have to worry about even the littlest pitchers. I can't wait until we can afford the series sets."
3,"Red Green's We can't help it, We're men","Overall I'm happy with the DVD, but I was expecting more variety in the shows. I'm going to order the Duct Tape DVD."
5,You will literally L O L,"First listened to it in the car. Laughed so hard I cried. They need to put a warning on it -- don't listen while driving heavy machinery. We listen to it over and over again, which is rare for a comedy CD (for us, anyway). I regularly buy more to give as gifts. There are a couple spots that are a bit racy but mild by today's standards, so don't play it when you're carpooling 3rd graders. :)"
5,Funny,Crazy funny to listen to with friends and family. I bought for five and now its 18. What is that all about
1,does not work with DirectTV,"I bought a pair of these so I could put my over-the-air antenna outside and run my DirectTV signal and antenna signal through the same line so I wouldn't have to run another cable line. The antenna runs through it just fine but the DirectTV signal will not go through it even without the antenna hooked up. If you have DirectTV, I highly doubt this will work for you."
4,"it is good for antenna, but.......","when I combine antenna cable and dish satellite to tv, antenna signal is pretty good ( very clear, I can get a lot of local digital channel even I just use old analog antenna ($1), but satellite signal dramatically decrease, all satellite channel is not clear any more. I don't know why. I switch around, nothing change. I guess this combiner probably block signal from satellite cable. I didn't see any reviewer montioned this. did I do something wrong or this is the way it is? any input, apprecite it."
1,Doesn't Combine Cable and Antenna,"Tried this to combine regular analog cable with the digital broadcast antenna. The cable came through fine, but didn't get much of anything via the antenna--especially digital HD signals. When I hooked the antenna directly up to the TV, I got 27 HD channels. But got none of those with the channel plus. I don't recommend this for combining at least one low-energy signal like an antenna. Tried to return the product to the company because I was dissatisfied. They said they wouldn't accept it. Waste of $16."
1,Doesn't work,"I bought this item to combine two digital cable boxes into one cable out so that I could once again use both turners in my dual turner series 2 TiVo. I set one cable box to send it's signal out on channel 3 and one out on channel 4. Only one channel (3) was clear, channel 4 was not viewable. I bought a similar item from Radio Shack (their item 15-2586) which I got before this item and it did the same thing though channel 4 is a lot more viewable. I found out after I got that item home that it combined 1 UHF and 1 VHF signal to 1 output which I am guessing is what this item is for."
2,home user,"It is only a regular splitter. If you want to combine air and cable signals together, it doesnot work. Try to buy a different one."
3,spliter yes combiner no,As a splitter works very well. As a combiner it has high attenuation levels on midUHF band and then works fine if you going on high UHF band.
3,"Did not receive the item advertised, but we still love them.",what we got are the normal non-glowing underwear. We love those but I can not give a good rating if items being shipped are different from what is being ordered.
1,Would have loved them if I had actually received this item.,"I was so excited to get these, but when they arrived they weren't at all the ones shown here. The ones I received have pictures of sporting equipment along the top band which I don't care for. I'll be returning them."
4,Boys boxers,"My grandson loves these ""big boy"" boxers. I bought more, he was so happy with them. He said they were just like Daddy's."
1,Not what is pictured here,"My preschooler was super excited about his new underwear, it's a shame I have to return them because they aren't what I ordered. As a previous reviewer noted they have exposed elastic with sports images on them."
1,Did not recive what is pictured,I wish I would have read the reviews. I did not received this item as pictured. They have a white waist band with sports balls
5,nice undies for my son,My 5 year old son had to have boxer briefs just like mine. I've tried other brands but always come back to Hanes for a nice fit and comfort. My son has no complaints and they fit him nicely too.
2,Underwear had been opened and resealed,"The underwear had been opened, and were not the original set. They didn't appear used, but you expect to be ordering a new product not something that has been shifted around. It was supposed to be assorted color and wasn't, it was all one color. The item is not new or as described."
5,Great!,"I got these for my 3 year old who is really tall for his age when I saw that his briefs didn't fit him right. He loves them! I would definitely recommend these to anyone. I used to buy them at the local Target, but they don't carry them anymore. The only place I could find them was online. Great deal for the money. I paid a few dollars less on Amazon and will be buying more when he grows out of these."
3,"Great look, not sure about the quality",I bought these for my little guy so that his underwear would look more like Daddy's--mission accomplished. The problem I have with them in the quality department is that the waistband separated from the lower portion on one of the 3 pairs in the pack. Seems like they are expensive enough to be of better quality.
4,decent,decent okay not bad does the job sometimes doesnt connect sometimes sAYS it cant be connect sometimes its half way and it says its fully charged but over all a majority of the time its good
1,Cheap piece of Garbage,Received this synch cable and plugged it into my iPad. After only the second time the little release button on the 30 pin cable end broke off. Now I can no longer use the cable because it won't release from the iPad. JUNK!!!
4,What Fantastic Music,"I'm a huge fan of the Wicked musical, I've seen it twice. This is a great musical to practice at home: some songs will be too challenging for beginners (Defying Gravity), but others are really fun for my 12 year-old(Popular). No karaoke album is as good as the cast album - and there are a few places where this one could be refined, but overall it's very enjoyable. If you want to hear excerpts from the album before purchasing, I found them at stage-stars.com."
1,NOT a good background tape!,I wanted to sing a couple of these songs at a school show but the tracks have no movement - no feeling! You can tell it is done on one synth. Does not sound like real instruments at all.Very disappointing!
1,"High Cost, Little Quality","This CD is such a disappointment! I sing with a traveling theater group and thought I could practice to this karaoke disc. Not a chance! The quality is poor-synthesized instruments & wrong notes and chords all over the place!Don't even get me started on the sample vocal tracks! I actually discarded this part of the pack as it was painfule to listen to. The vocals are horribly off key. Please, save your money. I know it's exciting to find this wonderful musical in a karaoke version but keep looking. Don't waste your cash on this one!!!"
1,My Heart is Aching.,"I was so excited to recieve this c.d. I paid extra to have it shipped the next day. But when i got it and popped it into my c.d. player, i almost cried with the results I got. The music coming from this c.d. sounds like a horrible high school band's rendition of all of my absolute favorite songs. and the vocalists on the vocal tracks sound like, i can't even describe. Here I am, 1 hour after recieveing this c.d., packaging it to go back. this was a complete dissapointment. in short, this is the butchered version of the Broadway Musical, and anyone who has ever heard the REAL soundtrack will know the extream difference between this one and the real thing."
1,Made me turn GREEN!!!,"I was so excited when I found the karaoke version of Wicked. Until I put it in the CD player! The singers are out of tune, the instruments hit glaringly wrong notes, the tempo is off; altogether, it's a piece of garbage. If I could give it less than 1 star, I would. I would definitely advise AGAINST buying this product!!!"
1,Lousy CD,"I also bought both the Pocket Songs version and this one, and without a doubt the Pocket Songs is infinitely superior. I haven't even bothered to listed to the vocal tracks, because of the TERRIBLE treatment of the orchestrations in the background tracks on this CD.There seems to be no effort made to even approximate the Broadway sound (yes, I have seen the show in NYC. I've also virtually memorized the music from the original cast album, and have read the vocal score). Sloppy playing by the musicians, absent orchestral parts (synthesized or not), whole gaps in the score, accompanied by strange phrasings that made me wonder if they had done a complete re-write, or were perhaps playing the music from memory. [...]The Pocket Songs CD may be missing ""No One Morns the Wicked,"" but this Stage Stars version is so lousy that I couldn't even listen to that number all the way through. It set my teeth on edge.I'd love to get my money back, too."
3,PLEASE HELP,MY FRIEND AND I LOOOVE WICKED!! HER B-DAY IS IN 4 DAYS SO COULD SOME ONE PLEASE TELL ME IF YOU NEED A KARAOKE MICHENE FOR THIS!! PLEASE!!! E-MAIL ME AT SEALPRINCESS@ATT.NET! THANKS SOOO MUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Not a good idea,"This recording is not at all like the original cast recording. It is someone else's arrangement and not even done well. They are out of tune, the tempos are inconsistent, and sometimes the instruments even hit wrong notes! It is way overpriced for such poor quality. I have been nothing but disappointed with this CD."
1,Not good at all,"Firstly, the vocals are terrible, the singers are really bad. And the actual karaoke is bad too, it doesn't sound anything like the background music of the OCR (original cast recording). The only good thing WAS that it had NOMTW and SB and pocket songs didn't. (No one mourns the wicked and something bad.) But just now a new one has come out with those two songs and more that actually sounds like the OCR. So I think you should get the pocket songs one, and the other one with NOMTW and SB. And by the way, I'm not a kid i'm 13 I just didn't feel like signing in... :)"
1,Don't waste your money,My daughter needed the karaoke version to perform one of the songs for a show at her school. This version is absolutely horrible. Neither one of us can even stand (or sit)to listen to this cd. What a terrible waste of good hard earned money. Everyone who has purchased this should receive their money back plus 10% and an apology for being subjected to hearing this. Shame on the people who produced this cd and are making money from it.
1,Poorly produced.,"Avoid this disc! The tempos on are too slow, the instrumentals are very synthisized, and the orchestrations are less than accurate. A friend of mine bught it and asked me to work ""For Good"" with her, neither of us could hear where we were supposed to be and it was just SLOW. The only plus is this is the only version you can get with graphics. The Pocket Songs version is better and the most complete of all available versions. If you can find it, Priddis put out what I think is the best version on 2 discs. The tempos and orchestrations are nearly exact to the show. I think it may be discontinued as I've only been able to find a few of the Wicked songs available through Priddis on a disc with songs from the Wizard of Oz."
2,Very disappointed.... not worth more than $15,"First, the demo vocals are cheesy like any karaoke demo vocals, so take that with a grain of salt.I got this CD for working on audition repertoire, and while it serves that purpose (original keys, original tempos), the listing for this CD is very misleading.The ""Full Orchestrations"" are done with a high-end Casio Keyboard, at best. There are no real instrumentations - instead, the background CD uses keyboards and synthesized orchestra parts. The flow is shoddy, at best. There are also numerous instrument picks that are ridiculously out of place - for example, strange ""horn"" instrumentation in ""For Good"" was really bizarre and distracting.If you're looking for a instrumentation CD for practing with, by all means, try to find a used one, think twice about spending full retail on this item.If you're looking to perform or use for any type of audition - please think twice. A good accompanist is worth the $30."
2,JUST SAD,I really thought that this was going to be great. It's very sad. It would have been a lot better if it was the actual broadway cast.
1,Pocket Songs?,"Every one says Pocket Songs is better.. does it not have vocals? It's very important to me not to have vocals, and have the original tempo and (hopefully) key. But where *is* the Pocket Songs one? Does amazon.com have it? I can't find it there.. but I'd like to get it."
3,Question about CD,"I dont have this karaoke CD, but I was wondering if the song ""What is This Feeling"" has the intro part where Galinda and Elphaba are writing to their parents and the part where the background chorus comes in on it? Thanks very much"
4,Finally,"America, America is finally coming out on DVD. To me this movie is worth the price of the entire set. They show it on AMC about once a year at about five in the morning so it is almost impossible to catch, it is just a great and very underrated movie. It is the story of an ethnic greek trying to emigrate from Turkey to the USA about the turn of the last century and is based on Kazan's own uncle."
5,Wild River - NOT River Wild,This download page is for the 1960 Elia Kazan film WILD RIVER starring Montgomery Clift and Lee Remick. Beautiful film about the creation of the Tennessee Valley Authority and the changes it brought to the region - both economically and socially. Love Meryl Streep but this is not that movie.
3,Packaging concern...,Another big box set without any information on the method of packaging the discs inside. Are they individually sleeved so that purchasers can dispose of the titles they don't want or is it just some big album with a bunch of loose discs? Why doesn't Amazon open the box up and photograph what's inside? That's a pretty high price and consumers have a right to see what's in there.
2,Does not do justice,"Elia Kazan is one of the great American film directors - 1954 alone produced two masterpieces: as his oeuvre is not large, it seems silly to have some omissions such as the still under rated The Arrangement - and why only one film per disc.I will not comment, as others have done, on the quality control as I do not own the set, but I am afraid this product is all too typical of the sloppy thinking that goes into many boxed sets."
1,ANOTHER RIDICULOUS FAILURE,"WHEN do you think it will happen that :The studios and releasing companies will respond to customers and issue practical,low cost,high quality products?The studios and releasing companies will take the art of their films as seriously as film fans do and make films available and affordable?The studios and releasing companies will stop doing the opposite and releasing over-priced, stupidly packaged, useless products like this one?The studios and releasing companies will finally take the American market seriously instead of ignoring the demand for the entire last century of film?Don't hold your breath, nobody at the helm who understands anything except STUPIDITY and GREED and PROFIT."
3,What are all the titles?,"will someone please tell me ALL the films in this set? Instead of saying some are available already from Fox, Warners, etc.?"
3,"Five stars for the movies themselves, BUT...","There's no question that many of the films in this collection are among the greatest movies of all time, but there is a major quality control issue in the release of this set. I just received a new, sealed copy, and while the packaging itself is very handsome, I was stunned when I took the discs out to examine them. In the set I received, EVERY one of the 18 discs had scuffs, scratches and what appeared to be flecks of adhesive on the playing surface. The DVD of PINKY in particular looked liked it had been scraped against a rough piece of metal. I can only assume this was the result of careless handling somewhere in the production process. My advice to anyone thinking of purchasing this pricey set is: if you really want to add the rarer films like VIVA ZAPATA! and WILD RIVER to your collection right now, you might take a chance and get it. Otherwise, I would hold off until these titles are (hopefully) released individually in the future."
4,Organs outloud...,"I really don't think that I am the one to judge Tinto Brass ability as a director. He definitely has his own vision of love, sex, and romance, and perhaps can even be considered a master in the genre. Although, i don't always feel comfortable with true-to-life depiction of human sex organs, i have to admit that when that hits the screen, it has an almost revelational quality. It takes away the porn, and just shows it the way it is. As for the plot summary, i think All Women Do It topples the other two by its inventivness and sort of raw presentation."
4,Tinto Brass,What else needs to be said? This is a great value 3 pack. I always enjoy anything that Tinto has directed.
1,"Miranda, looong, slow, sleeper...","Wow, I kept hoping this movie would pick up, boooring. She just seemed like a cruel flirt to me. One who enjoyed stringing men along. I'm a woman and very much enjoyed Cheeky, great flick! Got it for a Valentine's gift for my sweetie. We had a wonderful time but this one, towards the end I fell asleep a couple times and still don't quite know why we sat thru the entire thing. I haven't watched the rest of the movies after this one, I didn't want to be disappointed and waste my time. I sure hope they are better!"
1,Misleading,The Old & New Testament in Super Giant Print were advertised but I onlyreceived a part of the old testament. I emailed the one selling the book & she returned my money because she only had what she sent me.Betty Loftin
5,Must Have,This album is one of my very favourites from Jars of Clay. The best songs on the album are:-Nothing but the Blood-Peace Like a River-God Will Lift Up Your Head-God Be Merciful To MeThis is truly an awesome album and worth every cent.
5,EXCEPTIONALLY CREATIVE!,I've never been able to get much into hymns (more of a contemporary type of listener). Jars have definitely reinterpreted the value and meaning of these hymnals both melodically and lyrically. Inspirationally humbling. One of Jars' best albums!
3,They could've done better...,"Alright, I own all of the Jars of Clay CDs and this one has to be the worst. Overall, there are only about 3 solid songs on this CD. THe best song is ""God Will Lift Up Your Head"". THey tried something new by having Martin Smith from Delirious come in on one of the songs, but Jars of Clay could've done a much better job with this CD. I reccomend you by their second newest CD, ""WHo We Are Instead"", instead of this one."
3,They can do better,"Okay I have heard better Jars of Clay albums before, this album stinks. Jars of Clay can do a lot better then this they seem almost non energetic as usual. A couple of songs sound like attempeted country, JOC is usually what I prefer a Christian Rock Band. The only reason I rated this three and not one is that I like a couple of songs. God will lift your Heads, Let us sing of his love and wonder, and Come and mourn with me a while. The band rocks but this album doesn't sorry."
2,Not very redeeming,"I wanted this CD to be some of the old hymns sung with all the verses in the original tune, but it wasn't.There were too few ""Old"" Redemption Songs, and odd music, with most the song being the chorus repeated..over...and over...and over...I only hear one of the songs on the radio.... just not what I was thinking it would be ....."
2,Jars Of Clay--too Depressing,"The lead singer's voice just rings with depression. Christian rock should be uplifting and I just don't get that anymore from JOC. I really liked their first and second albums, but I just can't get into their somber mode at this point."
5,Helps me worship.,"JOC's Redemption Songs is a great album of classic familiar hymns set to new arrangements. Not only are these songs rich in meaning, but the arrangements gives them a freshness that any generation can appreciate. So the album contains great music, solid biblical themes and creates a condusive atmosphere for heart felt worship."
5,Excellent CD,Each and every song on this CD is amazing. It surely blessed me. I love the song I'll Fly away. I am thankful this band truly walks with God and blesses us with their music!
3,cornstick pan,"After following steps on how to pre-treat the pan, the bread still stuck. Maybe I should have used a non stick spray. Also,I expected the pan to be larger. It wasn't worth the price because it was too small."
5,Cornbread Iron Skillet,"My son-in-law loved the cornbread that his mother made in these pans, so I thought that it would bring back those cherished memories of his childhood by buying a set of these Cast Iron pans. He loves them!"
5,Great cornbread pan,"I have always liked Lodge cast iron pans and this one is no exeption. This is a heavy well made pan that with proper care will last for generations.The key to using a cast iron pan is to properly season it and keep it seasoned. For this pan, I rubbed it with melted Crisco and baked it for an hour at 400, then let it cool slowly in the oven. This should create a beautiful glossy black finish; if not, do it a second time and again whenever the seasoning has worn off. Always hand dry a pan like this, never let it air dry or it will rust.I have never had a problem with cornbread sticking. I preheat the pan and then pour the batter into it. I use a small ladle for this and leave the pan right on the oven rack. When the cornbread is done you just flip it right out onto a plate. The only drawback I have had is that I usually have to make a few pansful of cornbreads sticks for them to last through dinner."
4,cornsticks,"this pan has worked great, cornsticks are a coveted childhood memory, this isn't the mold my grand mother had, but its fun, and when they came out of the mold crispy and shaped like little ears of corn a flood of memories came back, best price for this mold I found on line,"
2,The corn sticks,"I'm in favor of cast iron cookware in general, and so was charmed by the looks of this pan, and the notion that I could bake ear-of-corn-shaped ""cornsticks"" in it. Theoretically the trick to cornsticks that you can hope to ever actually remove from the pan is to preheat the well-seasoned, greased pan thoroughly. Remove it from the oven and then add the batter carefully, so you don't burn yourself or any part of your kitchen - and proceed. The cornsticks should come out easily. If they don't, you are in good company. And at least you have a cute-looking, historic, relatively inexpensive American pan that someone, somewhere can bake successful cornsticks in!"
5,A must have book,"If you fly, or even dream of flying, you need to have, and read, this book. I have flown since 1966 and loved every minute of it. This book taught me how to really understand what I was doing up there ... it ought to be mandatory reading for all student pilots."
4,Things they just don't teach you in Flight School,"I'm not a complete fan of the writing style, but the information offered is quite valuable to me anyway let's say. There are items of interest you might not, or most likely will not get from MOST CFI's. No offense, but too many people rush through school just to get certified then become a CFI. They get the right answers that they memorized on the test based on what they have to answer, flew the right patterns well enough to get by and so on, you know the type. Not saying the right answers are wrong, but a lot of those test-passers can talk the talk but can't walk jack-s***.The point is, this book breaks down many important concepts that I personally am not just memorizing, but making mine. If there was an emergency situation, and I knew you read this book, I would rather have you flying the plane than someone who's flown for 10 or more years and hasn't. (Read the book.)Highly recommended."
5,The Greatest Book on Flying I've Ever Read,"I college I've taken several courses on aerodynamics, aircraft design and the theory of flight. They would've all been far easier to understand if only I had read ""Stick & Rudder"" first! This is one of those few works that just draws you in the second you pick it up. It's provided me with a better understanding about the airplanes I fly than anything else I've been exposed to. This could very well be the best work ever written on flying."
4,Stick and Rudder - what we've forgotten,"Well, I got my Private Pilots license a couple of months ago and want to improve my Stick and Rudder skills so I bought... ""Stick and Rudder"". It's interesting to me how much has not changed in all the years since this book was written, but also there were a couple of sections near the end of the book that covered material in a simpler fashion than Rod Machado's book, which I used during my primary training and really enjoyed. I think this book is worth buying if you are training or just interested in blowing out the cobwebs."
5,"If you fly anything, you must read and understand this book","I was introduced to Stick and Rudder as a student sailplane pilot 35 years ago and since then have bought and given away a dozen copies. To put it very simply, whether you fly a jet transport or a rubber band powered model, whether you have 1000 hours in the left seat, or just took your first hour of dual, unless you read and understand this book, you simply do not understand how an airplane works."
3,Better to stay grounded than take off this dirt - review by Jameson Thottam,"This is an old hack book for beginners and is frankly a waste of time. Most aspiring pilots, like myself, look to be inspired in order to get away from corporations and the daily grind in cubicles at such firms such as Homestore, Morgan Stanley, IndyMac Bank and LEK, can get one very agitated, and found flying to be a great outlet. This book does none of that. It is based on old basic foundations of flying without teaching the user how a plane fundamentally flies (an important concept for this line of work).If you want to learn the insider trading tips on how to fly, this is not the way to start. If you are looking for some superficial and sec ondary basics with no care on the primary concepts, then maybe its worth it....but I would not recommend this overall other than for the average pilot.Jameson Thottam"
5,fantastic layman's explanation of theory of flying,"As a flight instructor, I recommend this book to all my students. Although over 50 years old, it still tells exactly why an airplane acts the way it does, and he tells it in layman's terms. This book is a Must-Read for every person working toward a pilot's license."
5,good read...,"very good book, lots of information and easy read.if you are a pilot or want to be is a great read..."
5,The only coffee table book you'll ever need,I just saw this last night at a friends house and could not wait to get online and get one for myself. AMAZING pictures. This has to be one of the largest books I have ever seen. I would've expected this book to cost $100+. Can't wait to get my own!
4,A nice addition to any collection...,"The photography in this book is very provocative. And there is sooo much, so unless you are satisfied just flipping through a book before leaving it for dead, you can count on working on this book for awhile! Yes, a lot of it focuses on war, but unfortunately, wars have become the significant milestones of the past 100+ years of history. It is still very exciting to get to see so much ""up close and personal"" thanks to the photographers who took the time to take the shots!My only complaint about the book is that I found some of the captions to be excessively slanted, politically. Obviously captions are necessary to explain what we are seeing, but I felt that some of them they were also saturated in judgement that was simply not called for, even for a photojournalism book. Not quite enough to be obnoxious, but enough for me to give it 4 instead of 5 stars."
4,For Misty Fans ONLY,"Erin brown has been acting for more than a decade, and she's been successful since the start with fans in the erotica and horror genre. Now the doe eyed star made her second film after releasing her first film LUSTFUL ADDICTION, under the SEDUCTION CINEMA label, Erin Brown made a 6 minute short black and white film that is silent, but utterly creepy. I highly recommend this for any Erin Brown fan."
3,blocks the hdmi port,"This is a good product, but a bit of caution to prospective buyers. If you want to use this purely for the toslink optical out port, it will block the HDMI port on your Xbox360 Elite (I'm not sure about other models). This was not mentioned in the sellers ad and would have helped steer me to the more useful and proper cable.However, if you find yourself in the same boat, simply snap the plastic cover away from the larger end. Just use a small screwdriver to get started, then a bit bigger one and it should pop right off. Then you can plug it in and still have room to plug in your HDMI cable.Why on earth Microsoft made one end of this ridiculously large is just maddening."
5,we needed this cable,"YIKES!!! Our xbox cable got broken and we couldn't find one. What a relief to get one from Amazon. We are of course very happy with this product. It is as described and works perfectly. We probably should have got two, just in case!!"
1,Non-HD Cord,"I purchased this cord from WorldWide Distributors (http://www.amazon.com/shops/A3H89ADJHTH9SN) in hopes of getting HD to work on my new television. The cord they sent didn't have HD capability. I tried to contact the seller to return, they didn't allow me to return it. I also tried to contact Amazon about this but they declined to allow me to return it...I've had good success with amazon in the past, just not in this case.Do not purchase this cable if you're wanting to use it for high definition."
1,do not buy its not the same as picture,"i ended up getting a xbox cable but it dosent split like it shows in the picture it splits like 5 inches from where the r,g,b, and audio cables the reason why i bout this product was because my stero system is placed at least 2 ft away from my projector hence why i wanted the one that looks like in the picture dont buy and also its not microsoft"
2,AV Cable,"Not in ""good condition"" as advertised. The cable works for now, but the end that goes into the xbox is falling apart."
1,Garbage,"Hooked it up, XBOX wasn't receiving an HD signal but a regular picture, then the video went out but audio remained. Checked my XBOX with a regular video line and HDMI and it worked fine. Product in description says sold by Microsoft but I highly doubt its made by them."
1,Didn't work,"I have an HD TV and when I plugged in the cable, it didn't work. I turn on my xbox, and I can't hear sound at all."
5,Works great,"Xbox 360 Component HD AV CableProduct works as described, looks miles better than the regular cable, and it even compares to the HDMI picture from my ps3.I recommend anyone who doesn't use HDMI on their 360 use this cord if they have a hdtv, it looks amazing."
2,Its bad,Ive had no problems with the thing untill about a month ago. the video started going out. i only had it for about 3 months until it started doing this. The sound works. I'f i'm lucky i can get the video to work.
1,"Broken after a year,","Bought this cable and almost exactly a year later, the green part of the component fails to work. but at the $9 I bought it at, whats there to expect."
5,xbox av cables,my grandkids were happy to get the wires the ones they had broke and they couldn't play there xbox so i ordered them
5,Loved IT,"Brand new , Right Microsoft Brand <3 10/10 this product was excellent. all in all this product was cool , thanks"
3,Can you really trust the OEM,"Here I am, trying to buy the video cable because it failed, after limited play, no movement of game console and after only 9 months. I see other reviewers stating their cables have failed but not as quickly as mine. So here they are, to buy new. Just the fact that MS XBox has a troubleshooting sequence for the cable connection is just plain ""sad."" I expect trouble with any device connected to my phone/DSL line but not this, this kind of failure should come from being beat up by some kid not caring whether he was forcing the cable into the console. Maybe my standards are high but I have never had to replace my Monster Cables."
1,Cables don't work.,I got this in the mail and plugged it right in only to realize it doesn't work. This isn't a Microsoft brand which I should've known by the price. I just lost 10 dollars on this piece of junk. The cables don't work on either setting all you get is standard definition.
2,not to good,got the hd av cable and it took over two weeks to get it! from Cal. to Ma.It was in poor condition when was suppose com new but it was used! works fine mad that it came used!
3,Works as advertised,Works well. These should be standard equipment by now. The price is not that high for these and they work as they said they would.
5,HD is the shizzniz,"Before I was jus playing Batman, but now, I AM BATMAN!! HD gaming is the tits. .highly recommend it to every gamer"
1,Doesn't Work,"Doesn't work right at all. The screen will randomly flash black, lasting anywhere from 5 seconds to 5 minutes. Doesn't happen much at first, but the more you use it the more often it happens."
5,Very cheap and no issues at all. I'm a very happy camper,I bought this because I overused my first HD AV Cable for my xbox. It went through a lot of wear and tear since I would be moving around my house a lot and dragging the cables around.There is not much to really say about this product other than it works like a charm. I've had it for a couple of months so far and I have yet to encounter any issues.Pricing was great for this item because it wasn't used like the ones in electronic stores and it's really cheap. You'll be satisfied if you are looking for a cable like this
5,Old,Worked out really well. My child still uses this today and it has been quite a while since it was ordered.
1,Never buy from Pro Cables Direct,"The cable is described as ""NEW"" but i got a used one, which looks like it came from someone's backyard.I expect a ""NEW"" product as posted in the picture."
5,HD AV Cable,"This product works wonders with my XBOX and my TV. Provides a crisp clear picture on my TV. Great alternative to an HDMI cable, almost same quality picture for a lot cheaper price."
5,Great Xbox 360 HD Cable,"The Xbox 360 HD cable worked beautifully on my new HDTV.And now I can play my games in 1080, I recommend the product."
5,"Cheap, high quality product!","when i purchased hd component cables i expected a generic, poorly made product that would be shipped in a plastic bag with some tape, and i was expecting it as well, given the price, however i received a properly packaged,high quality set of cables. they do not feel cheaper than the 1st party cables that cost upwards of $30. they do their job! and for under $10 they are pretty legit"
2,Poor Quality,"As with many component cables, this one was poor quality and had a burn-in green tint. I give it two stars simply because it works. Unless you are willing to gamble with these, I suggest you just spend an extra $10 to buy one from an actual store, buying a good quality cable and securing your ability to return the cable if there is a problem."
4,Great price Official microsoft oem component cable,"Awsome price cant be beaten. I looked eeverywhere and they were piece of $#!t knockoffs. I only trust oem microsoft products with my xbox360 especially with cables and p.s.u.'s. (power supply units) My only concern or worry was...Ok for instance Out of all the years ive see the oem xbox360 component cables and the standard audio/video cables from microsoft they always had grey ends with the cordinating color band for audio or video at the end. These cables have 4 grey and two red and white. Seems a little sketchy, pehaps they were fixed with some cheaper ends, or ends that were non microsoft, i dont know. They were cheap price, and they work great. Would i reccomend getting them for anyone else, yes. Shipping was fast, got them in 2 or 3 days."
3,Don't get on Amazon,"The cable they have here sells for $15 at Gamestop. It's not a microsoft cable, which is the only reason I can think of for hesitancy, but my microsoft A/V cable was ruined within 6 months, so their products aren't necessarily solid. Anyway, you can buy two at Gamestop for less than this one so you definitely should. It wasn't even used.You definitely should get the HD one if you can use it, by the way.Note: A/V chord at gamestop- $12, HD A/V- $15"
4,a good replacement,"i can't say much but it help me play my xbox again...also i really appreciated it for coming on time in my residence,,thank you......."
5,Good buy,Price was perfect. Shipped quickly and arrived on time. Gets the job done. I recommend this product if you are replacing an old or damaged cable for your xbox 360.
5,its a cable,shipped fast. works great. I only on my tv have two hdmi slots and with a xbox 360 and Blue Ray and hi def satilight receiver didn't have enough and with this i still get my hi def for the xbox.
3,"Good, but for a limited audience","Personally, I would recommend a straight HDMI cable over this. HOWEVER, if you are in a situation where you have a TV without an HDMI blade, this gets the job done."
2,Hopefully will last longer than most,"Stanley and Klein USA-made tools are second to none, but their small pliers are all made in China. So far every Chinese-made hand tool I've owned has become chipped, dented or bent in short order. If it has a cutting edge you'll be lucky to get a year of moderate use out of it. I cannot find a new set of small pliers made in the USA, but I trusted the Stanley name and hoped for the best. These seem to be slightly sturdier than others although the spring is pretty flimsy. Time will tell."
5,What a Story,"Simply put, this is 192 pages of masterful writing. I read the book in one sitting because I couldn't help but finish it. It's that good of a story and it helped me rethink how I was approaching my life and financials. The book kind of reminded me of Horatio Alger's stories and other ""Rags to Riches"" stories I've read BUT it went further into the ""How To"" that's often missing in other books. It was definitely worth the money... especially since the author is donating 50% of his profits to charity. Buying this book is a definite win-win situation!"
3,Good intro mask,Lenses work great. Easy to clean. Comfortable. But the mask itself is very wide and bulky. Definitely provides a lot of coverage but decrease look and moveability.
3,Good but,good mask it is very comfortable but the lens fogs and it scratches very easily. other wise the lower half is not as flimsy as some think and will not let balls hit your face
5,Great Mask,"Confortable, strong, tight mask. But when recieved the bottom rubber part was bent out of shape, took awhile but got it straight"
3,Disappointing for price,"For this amount of money I would expect the program to have at least a workbook with it. This program is just a cd rom which you then have to print the workbook out. For this price, the least they could have done was bound a workbook together. Very disappointing...."
3,Yes its new...from 1985..,"Purchased as a gift. Book is a orginal copy, not a reprint. Would have been nice to have known that ahead of time. $20+ seems a bit steep for a book this old. Book inside is mint. The cover and outside looks used."
2,OK prog - but a bit boring,"The album is decent - some good tunes. But some of the songs that are longer get boring because there is no new music introduced - they just keep repeating the basic tune. Also, I am not exactly sure why this is considered prog. It certainly doesn't come close to the masters of prog like Genesis, Marillion, Flower Kings, IQ, etc. I wouldn't buy any more of their CD's based on this one."
4,Worth A Look For All Prog Fans,"RPWL is a German-born group that started out as a Pink Floyd tribute act. While the Floyd influence is clear, this band should not be dismissed as a knock-off. ""Roses"" has a melodic beauty that the Pink rarely aimed for, while ""Start the Fire"" and ""Wasted Land"" show a distinctive knack for hooks. This is definitely progressive rock, but in more traditional bytes (not 20-minute forays). There are moments when they sound as much like the Moody Blues or Saga as Floyd but, in any case, any fan of prog should definitely give a listen."
2,wrong book,"Wrong book. Returning it today to vendors address. This is the second book that was not what I ordered. I donated the first one to where I teach ESL. I really wanted the book I ordered, I just can't keep sending it back.The covers on the book are the same pictures, so I understand the confusion.The 1st book was an activity book. The second a picture dictionary English only. I orderedr spanish/english dictionary"
1,A big nothing,"Another product I fell for because I love the scent of lavender. However, using even THREE sheets in the dryer and no discerable transfer of scent to cloths or linens. A waste of money."
2,Not good... but essential,"This is just for fans. There are a lot of Queen's tributes tha are much better than this one, but is a ""must have"" for fans of Queen, the covers are bad example that music of Queen is. I think the cd is not the worst in the world, but certanly isn't the best tribute to Queen. In generaly, is regular and mediocre."
3,Freddie is missing,"Several tracks make the album worth buying... It's A Kind of Magic and one of the Another One Bites the Dust mixes are good workout/running songs. Most tracks are interesting at least, but you quickly realize the strength of the original Queen songs was Freddie Mercury singing. All of these tracks will disappoint if that is what you're after. Also, if you're looking for a good dance-ish album, this electronic tribute isn't techno. But if you just love Queen and are looking for something interesting, go for it."
1,Yikes---That's Bad,"I read the other reviews prior to buying this album. I figured that Queen music would be good no matter who sang it---was I ever wrong. I tried to listen with an open mind. In fact, the first track of 'Who Wants to Live Forever' is really quite good, but it goes downhill from there. The true feeling of Queen does not come through in this CD. The background is very noisy, too much guitar, synthesizers, etc. Not strong enough on the vocals. I would not recommend it."
5,top 100 tips and tricks,I absolutely love this book!! It is easy to follow and shows some terrific tips. If you're looking for a book to make some Photoshop CS2 editing easy go for this book. I rate it 5 out of 5 stars for what information I'm looking for.
2,Unless it's free.....,"Unless you get this book free don't waste your money. The ""author"" frequently omits critical instructions. She assumes that you already know how to do certain applications. Hey Lynette honey: If I knew how to do it, I wouldn't have purchased your crappy little book. Use free online resources instead."
4,Nicely produced colourful quick reference,This is a great little quick reference book that gives 100 tips in full colour and explanation. Very handy for learning CS2
3,Lip Fusion Collagen Lip Plump,"I like the feel of this product, but I haven't really noticed much of a difference as far as lip volume. I still purchase it believing that it's doing something youthful for my lips, and the price is right on Amazon. I would not buy it for the retail price. Seller is wonderful."
1,Don't buy it.,"Carmen Electra made a decent video with the first installment of the NWWL. Then she chopped that video into 3 pieces, added some useless crap to fill some time, and put out 3 more videos, claiming it had different wresting matches. There's not much on this video, considering they are simply trying to empty your wallet."
4,Bottoms up!,"There's lots more in this book than just recipes--great info on giving a cocktail party, etc. I especially liked the author's personal touch--like the stories about her younger days and learning that there's more to drink out there than just ""house wine"" or beer. Good appetizer recipes, too."
3,good,"The toy is for a 4 yr old and he's not quite ready for all the detail on the toy. But he really like it because it from the ""Car"" series."
5,Suspenseful,This movie has a Great twist in the Story. I thought it was Great. If you like kung-fu you will enjoy this movie.
2,out of date,"Its not that this book is bad but just that the edition I recieved was published in 1991. It is geared towards someone buying a piece of land for little money using mass letter mailings, only to have a deed to ""land"", wether or not it is usable.The used copy I recieved had prior owners notes written on a few pages, but since I paid such a small amount for this and it provided me with a couple hours of reading no problem. Amazon and the seller in this transaction were flawless, shipping was fast."
3,Jamica Christmas is a little bit over the edge,"At first, I liked Jamica Christmas, but after a while I reliazed how corny it was. I would tell people to buy this CD, though, because it is a good laugh."
4,A must for any TYA fan,"Good Ten Years After album, their fourth. It's not ""A Space In Time"" (definitely their best), but lots of energy, and Alvin Lee...well, what can you say? He's still one of the best to this day. Speed, finesse, and soul, a rare combination. You can feel the emotion of every note he plays, as if his emotions came right out through his fingers. An incredible depth of feeling."
2,Not Quite What I Expected,"This recording is not quite what I expected. My only reference is the original vinyl version on Deram which was great. Here, the background is weak and the dynamics have all been sucked out through a straw. Should be renamed ""Sterilized"". This mere shadow of the original recording is disappointing.This is the 2004 import issued by EMI. I have not heard the other CD versions."
4,Wait For The Marvel Omnibus,Marvel Comics now owns the rights to this character as of 2009 so expect to see an omnibus edition containing the entire series. If you can wait a year or so you'll save a small fortune over the individual issues and graphic novel collections. Who knows we may even see new material from Gaiman and/or Moore.
1,"Terrible, Just Terrible","I cant say more then that. Im glad that there was only seven songs cause that was some bad music. If i listened anymore I dont think i could take it. I love Ska but that was to lame. I would have had more fun sitting in on a real Filibuster. I dont suggest you buy this, instead invest into some Bosstones cds."
1,Look for new.,This is an outrageous price for an outdated book. Get the newest edition for half the cost. DO NOT use the outdated edition for testing prep. Try Captain's Nautical Supply.
4,Amazon made right on poor packaging,"The first one arrived somewhat loose in a box, must have rolled around because the shinny finish was marred and couldn't be corrected. I sent it back and had a replacement sent. Much better care was taken with second shipment and it arrived nice and shinny. This is an outstanding carafe that seals really tight at the top to keep the coffee hot. Superior to the Thermos brand carafes. For serious coffee drinkers it's much better drinking coffee from a carafe than coffee that's been cooking on the coffee maker burner a couple hours."
5,Carafe,"We bought these so our guests could have ice water in their rooms. The ice literally stays frozen for days...even when the top is off.A good value and does the job for our B & B guests.Betty, Casa Montaña Bed & Breakfast, Redstone, Colorado"
1,Don't waste your money until they figure out how to package it!,The first time I ordered this carafe it arrived rolling around in the box. It appeared scratched and practically used. I returned the item to and received my second one in the same condition. We order from amazon monthly and this is a very poor representation of their company. Two words...quality control.
2,"Beautiful Color, Cold Coffee","I was very disappointed in this carafe. I wanted something to keep my freshly brewed coffee hot without the continued ""cooking"" on my coffeemaker. I know the tricks of using a thermos, filling w/ hot water, etc. After just 1 hr the coffee is too cool to drink! My teapot& cozy beats that! It's going back."
2,Alfi carafe,"After about 11 months, the top would not tighten correctly. This resulted in having to turn the cap several turns to open it partially so the coffee would pour. Pushing the button with the cap in normal closed position became useless as the coffee would not pour at all. The previous carafe (another brand) lasted many years and only broke when it was dropped. This one was a waste of money."
2,Does not hold 4 cups!,"I bought this for everyday use because I crochet and knit and have cats. Once I get settled on the couch to do my needlework, the cats curl up around me and make getting up to replenish my coffee cup difficult. The carafe does keep my coffee hot for the short time it takes to drink a carafe full. The description says ""4-Cup Carafe"", but it evidently means ""4 5-oz. cups"" because it only holds 20 oz. (2 1/2 cups.) If you want a small carafe, this one is nice, but it is a little too small for me.UPDATE: I have discovered that there is a design flaw in the lid. You depress the lever to pour your coffee and the coffee can go into the lid. I discovered this while rinsing the lid - when I depressed the lever, coffee came out!!! It wouldn't be a problem if all the liquid rinsed out at once, but I have to shake the lid while depressing the lever repeatedly and, sometimes, there is still liquid in the lid (I can hear it.) This makes me worry about mold inside the lid."
3,Not Shiny and New Like the Photo,"I received my Kaiser Alfi carafe today and was more than a little disappointed to find that it was not shiny and new looking like the photo depicts. Did it start out that way? That's anyone's guess. The carafe was just loosely thrown into a large box with some of the air pillows on top. The carafe is covered with scratches and looks dirty and if I weren't needing to use it for Thanksgiving dinner I'd send it back. This is not the kind of service I expect from Amazon, especially when I read that this has happened in the past with this same carafe."
4,What I Needed!,"This product did hold in the heat, as we used according to the directions. It looks a little ""plasticky"", but not too bad. For not so formal gatherings, it's a great product!"
4,Great Carafe..lousy packing,"Product does as promised, keeps coffee hot. Carafe arrived loose in box, lousy packing and the lid was off and all over the box. Carafe was scuffed up a bit in shiping but not enough to send back. I guess free shipping is poor shipping."
5,Very Informative if you're even contemplating hiking the GCN,We've been thinking about doing the Bright Angel Trail for a long time and really needed to know what was involved in hiking any of the Corridor trails. Watching this did not help us decide whether or not we would still attempt it but at least we know what to expect if we did. Still an AweSomE place! Just be PrePareD!!
4,"Great DVD, but could only play on the computer","We've watched this DVD several times and learn something new every time. We used it to prepare for an overnight trip to Phantom Ranch. We wanted to show it to the rest of our group using our DVD player and flat screen. It would not play on the DVD player. I'll admit my DVD player is old and I cannot play copied CDs or DVDs on it, but expected this should be a fresh ""factory made"" DVD that would work. If you are going to hike the canyon, buy this DVD."
5,Finally!,"I'm not a dancer, so I wasn't aware of anywhere that I could find good old-fashioned hairpins. The kind that won't rip your hair out or fall out at the smallest activity level! I have thick hair that is four feet long, so I need something that will really work. These have. :) They are sturdy, well made, and so far (after a month) the tips have stayed smooth and go easily through my hair. Well done!! I am so happy to have good replacements for the truly ""old""-fashioned ones that I've lost over the years. For all of my hair to be up at once, I use the 3"" model, but for smaller sections, I use the 2"" pins. I unreservedly recommend these.Happy hairdos!"
5,Love Love these pins!!!,These are the best pins ever. I learned about them from the Loc'd Glory website. I have locs and these work great at keeping my locs in place without the pain of the regular hairpins because of the unique shape and thickness of these hairpins. I had to order some for my daughter who happens to have locs also. Great product!!!
3,What's the point of this story?,"Nothing really happened in this book! Alison was boring, the story was boring. Ahh! I could hardly stand it. Magic Attic really needs to shape up some of their stories, yeah some are for young girls but still they should have some point and not be so predictable. I think you should read American Girl books instead, they have a point and you learn something. They are better written too."
3,Jwin Jhp40 Stereo Headphones,"They have a good sound, lots of bass, but they put a lot of pressure on your ears which can cause them to get sore after wearing them for a while."
2,No Depth At All!,"I bought this book based off of the reviews I've seen at this site by readers. After reading this book, I am totally disappointed. The type was extremely large (to increase the page count) and the content BARELY scrathed even the surface of most of the new concepts.This book would be ideal for users who've never shared a folder before, or have never worked in an admin position (all kinds of elementary info on how to ""communicate"" with co-workers...aka ""filler"" material). If you're in this category, then this book would be ideal for you. If you're familiar with NT 4 and want to look under the hood to see the new features and how they work, save your money."
5,"If You've Got Windows 2000, Get this Book","Hot dog! IP Routing, Kerberos Security, Active Directory and MMC - this book has got it all. Straight-forward, thorough coverage of key topics coupled with insightful, comprehenshive charts and graphics make this book a valuable resource guide you'll reference again and again."
2,"An Overview, not a how to guide","If you are thinking of buying this book as a ""How to Setup Win2k Server"" manual, think again.The authors do a very good job in demystifing Active directory, and kind of gloss over everything else. Is AD an important part of Win2k? Do bears live in the woods? Yes it is important, but you still have to deal with TCP/IP and security too.Fortunately for the publishers, and us, you can also buy a Win2K stup book, Security book, etc, etc.Which one do you need?"
2,Where's the beef?,"This book has some very good information, but, does not convey information adequate to supply a system administrator with the information necessary to run a network. It appears that that was the intent of the book, and I think the writers missed the mark.As examples, the backup utility is described. Unfortunately, the creation and maintenance of media pools is not discussed. One cannot use backup effectively (maybe not at all) unless the media pools and media are created and managed in advance of performing a backup.As a second example, the group policy discussion tempts you about creating an install package for software but never shows you how.This book will be one that I will use after exhausting other more reliable sources of information when I want an alternative view of Windows 2000 Server architecture and administration.Not a keeper."
4,Why The Wait?,"I'm super nostalgic and this show reminds me of my teen years in Europe. I found a couple of episodes online and realized it's just as great watching it as an adult -although quite cheesy! I think the the premise is a great idea and I love the characters. My issue is not with the show at all. My issue is with putting it out in region one 1 26 episodes at a time. I would gladly pay for box sets of all 5 seasons. Instead I have to watch half a season every couple of months. Ridiculous! I don't know what the point of doing it this way is but it is quite annoying. This show for me actually gets 5 stars, I'm taking one off because I can't watch the whole thing!"
5,LOVE LOVE this show,"One of my favorite shows of all time! I have been watching since season one, SO happy they are FINALLY out on DVD in region 1 format!!! took long enough ;p"
1,*yaaaaaaaaaaaawn*,"A singular and often stifilingly boring literary version of reality television, Leitch's book is the next phase in America's obsession with watching stupid people embarrass themselves. ""Life as a Loser"" is nothing more than an egotistical rant in a vain and somewhat pitiful attempt to gain popularity and sympathy through a lifetime of dissapointment. What separates this book from its electronically broadcasted brethren is one key component: good editing. Leitch's drawn out diatribes and abhorrent use of language leave the audience suffering from more than his self-effacing semi-biography. I have only one question: if it is obvious that Leitch has had such a horrible time living his own life, why would I want to waste my time reading about it?"
1,Narcisstic crap,"Don't bother. This book is not funny and I agree with the other reviewer from Boston. Leitch was probably pleasuring himself while writing 90 percent of the pages. That's probably why the spelling was so bad. Don't waste your money or time. You could be pleasuring yourself instead of reading about Leitch do it. If I could have given it zero stars, I would have."
1,"decency, anyone?","Will has an amazing knack for describing details about people's personal lives in his columns, despite that few, if any of them, have given him permission to do so. This book is more of the same... a look into his life, at the peril of those who know him. ""Life as a Loser"" is more of a please-like-me-I-want-to-be-Dave-Eggers tome than it is a legitmate piece of literature. You'd be better off catching a local coffee-house poetry reading."
5,For all of us Losers,"This book is excellent if you've been a reader of 'Life As A Loser' all along or if you haven't started reading Will Leitch yet. No matter who you are or where you're from, there's something in here that will strike a chord with the loser in all of us. Will recounts his troubles without bitterness and revels in being a writer without pretention. Only suckers and snobs would not like this book."
2,Book as a Loser,"It's one thing to crystallize elements, occurances, and people from your real life into your art by reshaping, rethinking, or at least renaming them; it's another to just pick them up and drop them in a book. Although some bits were funny, this writing is too much of a string of journal entries. For truly hilarious, ""real-life but not really"" stories, read David Sedaris."
1,Whingey and self-obsessed,"I was hoping that I'd like this book--after all, Tom Perrotta, author of 'Election"" and the recent well-reviewed ""Little Children"", wrote the forward. But Leitch's prose and subject are simplistic and overly self-conscious. For really good guy-lit, I'd read Nick Hornby (High Fidelity, for example)."
3,Not impressed,I am not impressed with these stings at all. On my cello they have terrible resonance. I like the Forte Jargar much better.
5,Cast Iron and the Space Age,"So far, every ""non-stick"" pot, pan, skillet, griddle, etc. etc. that I've seen is only an attempt to match what cast iron gives inherently. Cast iron provides a cooking surface that truly does spread the heat, and is the most non-stick surface available. Whether plastic or hard anodized aluminum, I have never found anything to match the performance of cast iron. Period.This griddle serves for grilled veggies, buttermilk pancakes, pork chops, hamburgs, turkey burgers, etc. etc. A few drops of extra virgin olive oil each use and it works very well.Or, I guess you could choose a pan with a petroleum-based liner."
5,the griddle I wanted to buy,I recently bought a cast iron griddle like the one shown and have found it very useful for broiling meats. The model I have has extended handles and is double sided. The handles make it slightly too wide for my oven so I have to put it in at an angle. The griddle shown looks like what I was originally trying to buy and would probably fit my oven perfectly. I wish Amazon had started this store a few months ago. I would have bought this model instead.
2,Don't waste your money!,I would not recommend this griddle. I have a flat top stop and it doesn't fit across both burners. Don't waste your money.
2,Cumbersome,This item is heavy and doesn't cook pancakes nearly so well as my friends' less weighty item from Smart and Final. It usually sits up high in the cupboard. I do not take it on camp outs.
2,Bad combo.,"I have one and use it for indoor grilling in inclement weather. It works fine for this, except for the wide 'shelf' on one side that limits the usable grille space. The problem with this design is that if you get it hot enough to grill on, it will burn off all the seasoning on the side you may wish to use as a griddle. There is no way this product can do both things it claims to do. I have a dedicated griddle for grilled cheese, pancakes, and French toast. I would prefer a dedicated grill to compliment it. Pre-seasoning or non-stick coatings are also not compatible with grilling lamb chops."
4,Texas Steak in a multi-unit world,"For those of us who live in mult-unit complexes ie.condos,apt.ect.with fire codes that don't allow open flame grilling;this cast iron griddle is in my opion the best alternative."
4,Excellent Product,I bought this product after reading other previews. I was very pleased. It is very heavy so you don't want to put away. I use it almost every day for breakfast or supper foods. Very good item for the price. I was completely satisfied.
4,love it!,"always need a griddle, even if I use it less than I thought I would and the price was right ($20!)."
4,Iron Griddle,"I am very glad that I purchased this item. I really enjoy using it even if it is heavy to lift, but it does a fantastic job and food taste just like you did it on an outdoor grill."
5,Lodge-Made in the USA,I use a lot of Lodge cast iron cookware. It is all of exceptional quality. The griddle is no exception. In addition to the high quality it is made in the USA.
4,Lodge Pro Grid/Iron Griddle,"I ordered my griddle and was expecting to wait 2 months before I actually got it ... but I received it in about 2 weeks. I love the griddle. I've grilled veggies, sausages and bread. On the smooth side I made pancakes and it worked great. I'll probably order another piece of cast iron cookwear pretty soon. I have my eye on the paninni press.The only thing that I'd change would be to somehow anchor the griddle to my stove to keep it from sliding on my burners.Anyway...I recommend this product.Sharon."
5,Unrivaled,"This is a GREAT product for the price. AND HERE'S A TIP. I followed Lodge's seasoning instructions to the letter, and in fact, did it three times. I was hoping to speed up the seasoning process. What I got was a medium brown, but still a (food) sticky surface. Quite by accident, I put it over the stove, turned both burners up to med-high (med-high+?) and moved the griddle around over the burners every 10 minutes or so. After about 1 1/2 hours I had a blackened seasoned surface that matched the Lodge preseasoned grill press that I also bought! Not quite as non-stick, but a few uses have fixed that! I'm not sure that Lodge would approve, and there will be some smoke, but it seems to work."
4,Worth the trouble of cast-iron care,"For pancakes, this iron griddle heats slowly and evenly, and it holds the heat better than a teflon griddle but...you...must...season this and instruct well-meaning helpers NOT, repeat, NOT to use any soap of any kind, sponge, steel wool pad, on the griddle. Ever. If you are worried about cleaning it, you can scrub the surface with a hot, clean water, handful of cooking salt and a clean paper towel. After seasoning, pancakes cook evenly and this is wide enough to go over two burners and really get some production going at breakfast. Just remember about the seasoning and the No-Soap."
4,great but needs special care,"Great to cook lots. There is lots of space to cook perfectly several steaks at a time.I use it for meat, it's make's it very similar cooking than with a BBQ.Indestructible!CAREFULL:* This needs to be hand washed, it MUST not go in the dishwasherIt's not that easy to clean specially on the striped part.* You need to prepare the grill before you can use it the first time or it will get very rusty. Preparation: putting a layer of oil and baking it in your oven for an hour. (Oil smell in the house and oil all over the kitchen)More explanations on the lodgemfg.com web site* It takes a little while to cool down.That means keeping it on the stove until its cooler, it's heavy and there are no handles.I do recommend it; I enjoy it very much it's worth the hassle.But don't want people to be surprised!"
3,Not For Me,"It's my own fault, I suppose. You see everyone on the kitchen shows with their reversible grills and think you need one, too. First the positive: This is an excellant price and you can't beat with the free shipping offer. For some this would be a great additional to your kitchen but not for little ole' me. First it takes a long time to season and is quite heavy. Since you can't put it in the dishwasher (dah) you have to wait for the grease to cool, use paper towels to soak it up, then haul it over to the sink for a cleaning without a hard brush, no soap. Then make sure you dry it well as it might rust. Just know what is involved before purchasing. For someone like me that uses it once every other week, it's wasn't the smartest thing I've ever purchased."
3,Unseasoned vs Seasoned Griddle,"The griddle was received as ordered. Unfortunately, I opted for the unseasoned one. I followed instructions on how to season, but was a bit disappointed with the result. Except for this ""problem"", I love the griddle. I recommend customers buy the seasoned version since it is fired at a very high temperature to provide a ""deep"" seasoning."
4,A grill for those of us who can't go outside to grill!,"I seasoned this christmas present and used it the day after to make pancakes. Wonderful! No sticking, easy on and off ... I can't wait to turn myself into a Backyard Bob on the inside."
3,Great Grill -- not so great mess,"We used the grill for a beautiful New York strip steak. The steaks were delicious. The stove was a mess. The stove has black marks under the grill. Took us 20 minutes to clean up the mess. I'm not sure I'm using it properly. ""What heat do you use to heat it up?"" The answer to this question should be on the box or on a slip inside the box. It's the lack of directions that informed my rating (3 stars). The grill itself worked absolutely fantastic."
4,Marmalade---BBC Sessions,"I searched rare record stores for Marmalade's album which includes ""Reflections of My Life"". I was unable to find it. But Amazon sent it to me in one day. All the songs are excellent. The only minor criticism I have of this CD is that it includes an announcer introducing Marmalade on some of the cuts. But this is a small price to pay in exchange for being able to acquire an album which is almost impossible to find in music stores."
4,The master of the erotic.,If you love well put together erotica with fantastic looking women in it then Tino is the man.I have all his stuff and the 'Key'(in my humble opinion)is his best work.
5,Sensational,"This CD contains 1977 recordings by a conductor not famous for his Prokofiev. On the strength of these performances it seems a shame there are no more. Both as good as any other top recommendation for both symphonies, especially for symphony no 5, which is clearly the best I have heard. Slightly muddy bass, but in excellent sound overall, with some lovely spotlighting of individual instruments when required. This CD would never disappoint."
4,"I thought the book was fascinating, very readable.","From some fresh views of Grant at Vicksburg to Nixon's Hanoi bombing in the 1970's, Ambrose puts together both insight and very readable prose that makes history seem like current events. The short essays offer pictures of people, their motivations and personalities that rarely come through other authors' historical writings. It's the third book by Ambrose I've read and I've thoroughly enjoyed them all."
1,"Different cover, same content","I have to agree with the New York reader who assails Ambrose's penchant for riding one horse too long -- this book is the latest rehashing of territory covered in previous offerings. While his affection for the subject matter is obvious and his writing style capable, Mr. Ambrose does ""churn out"" his war books. Buy one (""Citizen Soldier"" is, I submit, his Ur-text) and rest assured that the others are merely echoes of the same tale."
4,Past wonderful Future questionable,"Ambrose is a excellent writer and clearly a talented historian. I've been concerned with many historians' lack of interest in ""telling a good yarn."" He's a wonderful antidote for this trend and I hope he sits on many tenure and promotion boards. While I may disagree with some of his assessments, he does a yeoman's job in supporting them and his grasp of the data is excellent. I thought he fell short a bit when he left history and ventured into prediction, letting his hopes clearly override the historical record in predicting the end of war."
1,Just a bunch of OP-ED pieces,"I loved Ambrose's Citizen Soldiers and Undaunted Courage.That said, this book I thought was what happens when an author has written a couple of major best sellers. They come up with an idea and the publisher says sure before even looking at it.This is not really a history book. It's Ambrose stating his opinion about a number of points in our history. In many cases there isn't even a real description of what happened - just his opinion.For example, in 24 small pages, he tries to ""understand"" MacArthur. For someone that complex, giant books have struggled to understand him.All in all, a waste of time (and paper)."
2,mostly sloppy and uniformed with a few good bits,"Ambrose writes in a mostly accessible style which is not a bad thing, but this book is a mish mash of different magazine pieces that have virtually nothing in common and are quite uneven in quality. Further, some of his work is just pure opinion based on almost no real scholarship, (his arguments about the bombing of japan or the cold war come to mind). For armchair historians who think they ""know"" alot about history, Ambrose is the man, unfortunately his unfaultering US boosterism which results in obvious, moth-worn and erroneous conclusions will not really appeal to anyone else."
4,Back to the Dread Empire,"This self-contained volume picks up four years after the original Dread Empire series ended. The characters are still recovering from the devestating war that finished All Darkness Met. This time, Cook tells his story from the point of view of both of the former warring sides. Most of the book deals with a sub-plot outside of the main series story-line. RTEW is a must read for fans of the original trilogy, and also worth reading for those unfamiliar with it, since it has many references to those first books. It was the first I read, and it left me determined to find the others!"
1,Very Dissapointed,Mr. Cook sure missed the mark with this one. I read about two thirds of the book and could not figure out the plot. It seemed to be just one long description of war battles. This was my first and probably my last book by this author. Save your money.
1,Ridiculous,"This album is absolutely disgusting. She doesn't sing; the songs that are found on this album aren't really songs (they have no message).It's a shame that somebody was so bored that he had to make such a worthless,meaningless so-called album."
1,Not Madonna,"I GOT THIS ALBUM ON A USED CD RACK THINKING I GOT A FIND AND IT REALLY DOESN'T HAVE ANY LYRICS ON IT. I WAS REALLY DISAPPOINTED! IT ISN'T LIKE ANY OF HER OTHER ALBUMS AT ALL. DON'T BUY IT UNLESS ALL YOU WANT TO HEAR IS MUSIC OVERDUBBING OF MADONNA SAYING ""GIVE IT TO ME"" A ZILLION TIMES AND THAT'S IT."
1,Painful to listen to!,Do not buy this and if someone gives it to you as a gift spare yourself and everyone else by burning it.
2,if you just have to have her every cd...,"First off, Otto's voice is terribly annoying most of the time and the only tracls I like are ""Give It To Me"", ""On the Street"", and ""Let's Go Dancing"" because of it's 80s groove. This Cd is either for people who have been with her from the very beginning or people who just must have ALL her CDs. Her vocals haven't changed much at all, sh ecan still sing. I'm glad I only paid $4.47 for mine, but if you want an ""early years"" CD by her that you will love, get ""MADONNA: In the Beginning""."
2,Mysterious begining,"I first bought this CD on 1989. I was horrified as it was nothing to do with what I expected. I copied it on a tape and returned it to the stores. But later on I started to appreciate the value of this songs. This album is not indispensable for a fan but I have to say that it has a special ""trash touch"" which makes it a bit more interesting. ""Cosmic Climb"" and ""We Are The Gods"" are the best for sure."
2,Bleargh.,I downloaded this album and.. it's bad. But it's not truly as horrible as some of the previous reviews say it is. Yes.. it's.. definately odd.. but there are a couple catchy songs on it (mostly Wild Dancing) and some of the songs (We Are The Gods) are truly awful.
4,A hoot.,"This recording follows one of Jason Graae's live cabaret acts from start to finish. There is enough fresh and outrageous humor to make this disc a real hoot. Mr. Graae possesses a voice of truly impressive range and clarity. I'm glad I got this CD, but I wonder how often I will give it a repeat spin. I know that when I've heard the funniest jokes more than two or three times, I begin to lose interest. I'm afraid the same might be true for this production. I will say this ----- if Jason Graae were ever to bring his act to the boondocks of upstate New York, based upon this recording, I would certainly make a serious effort to attend it."
5,Fantastic!,"This is the best fountain pen I have ever owned! It has the convenience of a push button like a ball point. No cap to lose. And the fine point is excellent. Plus, the price was the lowest around."
2,Namiki Vanishing Point Black Carbonesque Fountain (Purchased on 07/09/2009) by Pilot Namiki,"We have recieved the pen without invoice or option to return , exchange. Pen did not have the right thickness and needs to be replaced."
5,RICO'S VIEW,Great set of suspenders. Very well built and comfortable. Work great on my tool belt should of bought these a long time ago.
3,not great for everyday use,the material does not stretch out that much so my husband is not able to use it everyday as intended. Otherwise it is made and looks nice
1,Don't bother,"The ""Gourmet"" gift basket was anything but gourmet. The jalapeno biscuits were crumbly and stale. The chocolate wafers were broken and also stale. The Camembert Cheese was Camembert FLAVOR cheese spread and not the real deal. the sweet butter cookies were missing. The candy was the miniature cheap kind given at restaurants for free. The only nice thing was the cutting board and the smoked almonds.The cake slice was decent as well. overall very disappointing experience and not worth the money"
2,something lost in rewriting?,My mother was very disappointed with this book. She felt that the stories were poorly rewritten from the original Joel Chandler Harris version. But maybe her memory of the original stories is imperfect.
3,"Poor editing and awful typos, otherwise - loved it.",I bought this while in New Orleans to give to my granddaughters. I have been reading each story aloud to them. They love the stories and the illustrations.I am so disappointed that the publisher did not correct the typesetting errors. I had to adjust what I was saying so that the improper syntax and typos would not be heard by my listeners. What a sad impact on a great book. Now I want to purchase another for my sister's children. I plan to include 10 or 20 one-dollar bills as finders rewards for them to identify the mistakes in the book. Hope that is enough. Basically making lemonade out of lemons. This book should be reprinted and offered as free replacement for current owners. Even Uncle Remus would have done that.
5,Great Book,If you remember the Brer Rabbit tales from memories past you will love this book. Written as it should be and well illustrated.
5,Children's Book,I've always loved Brer Rabbit Tales and all the Uncle Remus tales. They were some of the first books I read when a child. Can't wait to read to my new step-grandsons!
4,Good Deal - Not Perfect,"This is my first Carafe of this kind so I cannot compare with any other one. This Carafe is good looking in pure white plastic - didn't look cheap. The lid is very well designed - easy to close/open and good system for liquid delivering. On bad side, they say that this pot can keep liquid hot for up to 13 hours but it's not true. In fact, coffee will stay pleasurably hot for about 3 hours - not more. I'm still satisfied about this buy regarding the very fair price."
4,A very good product,"I bought this product to actually brew tea and keep it hot. I have had metal insulated products that got stained and scratched.So far this carafe has exceeded my expectation. It is lightweight and despite the exterior being made of plastic, it is not not cheap looking, in fact, it is prettyelegant.No problem with pouring tea out of it, the button works perfectly.It is easy to clean and appears durable.I am very satisfied with it."
4,wow. this guy is GOOD!,"OK, I just saw Paul Zunno and his band at Chicago Blues here in New York. They were electrifying! I wanted to bring home some of that raw energy, so I picked up this CD. I will make it a point to catch his show again. Zunno has some serious chops (not unlike Stevie Ray/Robbin Ford), but his song writing should not be over-looked. While this CD does not have the energy of a live show (duh...) it shows another side to the artist. I was surprised by the warmth of his voice. He is a rare example of a talented musician who has the ability to speak through his guitar AND his lyrics. Solid blues-rock. Check it out."
4,"Spooky, and a fun read!","I thought this book was good, but it wasn't one of my favorites. I didn't find the mystery to be too particularly interesting, but I must say that I did not know who this mystery person was until the end-I found out when Dawn did. Overall, I wished it was a bit scarier but it was still a good read."
1,Terrible Quality,"We had used the same tent for many, many years and thought it was time for a bigger tent. We bought this tent to better fit the family on our last camping trip. To our surprise when we tried to set it up, the grommet and tab that connects the pole to the ground was missing on one of the four corners. Also missing was the tab and grommet to stake down one of the mud porch flaps. We rigged the pole to our vehicle using some spare rope and used a rock to hold down the mud porch. It seemed ingenuity might keep the tent upright, but then a tab that was sewn onto the tent detached. We ended up fitting the whole family in the bed and cab of the truck for the night. We took down the tent and stowed the items in the carrying bag, hoping the experience with the tent would be over. Not quite. The seam on the bag now has a hole! The tent is tall and roomy but terrible for the wind. This is the worst quality I have seen in any product in a very long time. It'll be returned today."
4,1 a.m. and I'm still reading an economics book,"Perhaps Galraith's greatest appeal as an economist is the disdain he holds his own profession in. He is a merciless critic of thoughtlessness, ignorance, and the status-quo--and he's quite fun to read.Because this is an anthology of his life's work, themes are occassionally repeated. But you don't need to know much economics, and the writings are current."
2,Missed the target and hit the tree,"I really liked when Christina Milan did 'Snowglobe'. It was great. So, I was really hopeful for Christmas Cupid. It is semi-cute which about the best I can say for it. There's some humor to it, but the story just isn't that solid and tended to wander a bit. Cynthia Evans character comes off rather sleezy which I didn't think was appropriate for a Christmas movie. Then again, ABC Family has been far from ""Family oriented"" with much of their recent programming. So, in many ways, I guess I should have seen this movie coming.I might suggest renting it and watching it one time, but I would keep the younger kids out of the room. My teenager thought it was boring and not very funny - keep in mind that my teenager loved Snowglobe too. This movie isn't as bad as some 'Christmas movies' (i.e. Happy Feet), but it definitely missed the target on being a classic, unforgettable or one that should be watched year after year."
5,A Modern Version of A Christmas Carol,"Christmas Cupid is about a young woman named Sloane Spencer, (Christina Milian)who is a high powered Hollywood publicist. Sloane finds herself haunted by her recently departed client, Caitlin Quinn(Ashley Benson). Just three days before Christmas Caitlin takes Sloane on a journey to meet ghosts for her ex-boyfriends from past to present. Sloane runs into her old college boyfriend, Patrick (Chad Michael Murray) who is a doctor. Sloane is dating/her boss, Andrew (Burgess Jenkins). Sloane has to make a choice on which guy she chooses. Do you think Sloane ends up with Patrick or Andrew? Watch this movie to found out what happens to Sloane! It is a really cute movie. I would recommend this movie."
5,Christmas Cupid,"During the christmas season, I really love to watch movies like this one. It's so Right!!!!! Thank you, Pat from MD"
3,Christmas Silly,What can I say -- it was cute and silly. A very typical christmas movie that makes you smile when it's over.
5,good,"i love this movie... christina is always good... it had a good story ploit.. i love it... if your a christina millian fan, than this is the movie for you"
3,"Cute concept, but lazy execution","A modern-day Christmas Story starring a female scrooge in Hollywood sounds like a great idea. However, Christmas Cupid goes the wrong way. The ghost of the dead Hollywood actress - the equivalent of Marley - is the only one who fulfills her promise. The other ""ghosts"" are barely on screen. However, what really disturbed me was how pathetic the characters' lives are. In the original Christmas story, Scrooge really does some evil things and treats people poorly. By contrast, the ""Scrooge"" in this movie just comes off as overworked and stressed out. You get the sense that her family and friends abandon her a bit too easily. Her biggest crime is that she requires somebody to work during Christmas (God forbid!). I hope somebody does a Christmas Story remake right one day."
2,Even Free is a lot for this one,"Couldn't even finish it when it was free on TV. Check it out online if you live in the US at ""ABC Family 25 Days of Christmas"" before you consider buying."
3,Batman vs.,"It was a good movie, especially the batman superman. Loved It when batman just took superman girl! It should of come in blu-ray!"
2,Over Narrated,"This DVD has lots of beautiful video and photography, but that beauty is grossly diminished by an overbearing, condescending, and monotone narration that is also too loud. It would be a beautiful DVD if the narrator would shut up and not insult the intelligence of the viewer. It should follow the pattern of Winged Migrations using just music and natural sounds and a few subtitles. Instead it reads like a boring catalogue instead of a beautiful symphony. They should have had at least one version with just music and natural sounds, and then the current version could just be used in elementary school classes. There is room on DVDs for both, but the creator of this DVD is not very sophisticated in the art of film making."
1,Poor quality,I recently ordered a set of the white shelves. The legs were all different lengths and the boards were all warped. Plano has clearly let their quality slip lately.
3,if only,"the shelves are great i could even snap them together with no husband :)My only complaint is that both sets i ordered were chipped badly, making very sharp pionts all over them.And it just isn't worth returning so they work but I wouldn't want to buy them the way i got them"
3,Not the best quality,"The box of shelving parts arrived in good condition but inside three of the four shelves had broken edges . The shelves are thin and brittle and strain under very little pressure . When assembled and loaded with around sixty pounds of boxes this unit wobbles more than I'm comfortable with . I have purchased heavier duty units from both Plano and Gracious Living and they are so much better quality than these . Do yourself a favor , spend a little extra money and get something of better quality like the Plano 924/925 shelves ."
3,Plastic Utility Shelving,"The shelving I received arrived with some broken small pieces. One of the shelves was broken badly. I did some repairs using wood as a brace on the broken shelf. I decided to just keep the shelves and not return them because they were really needed NOW, and going in the basement anyway."
3,Autostart feature on this model is a joke.,"Apparently a great vacuum, however, the auto-start feature is only rated to 200 watts; much too little juice for any tool beyond a sander. The fact that they do not mention this in the specs is sad. When I spoke to a representative about this fact he told me to buy a cheap craftsman auto-start box to use with this $700 machine in case I wanted to plug in higher wattage tools. No dice. Fein and festool come close to this machine's quality, are cheaper and more versatile."
5,This CD is the coolest to hit the shelves yet,THis is a great song and has good beat to it. the only thing that is gay is the day dreams in the video. she looks good and sounds even better while singing.
4,Dreamin' for Daydreamin',"I THINK TATYANA HAS MADE HER CAREER OUT TO ALL SHE WANTS IT TO BE. SHE IS SUCH A COOL ACTRESS AND NOW A COOL SINGER 2. WITH A COUPLE MORE SONGS LIKE ""DAYDREAMIN"""" SHE IS GOING TO BECOME THE NEXT BRANDY. I THINK SHE IS A GREAT ROLE MODEL FOR YOUNG TEENS. 4 STARS FOR A eSTUPENDO cHICA!!!!"
2,Really disappointing,"I love historical fiction. Anyone who knows me, or doesn't, based on reading my reviews here, will tell you that. On the whole, though, I struggled with Niccolo Rising, primarily because the author lost me when she got into the political events of the time. Frankly, I was bored, so much that I began to skip pages to get to the more interesting parts. The language is dense and difficult to follow. I had to read this book is short fits and starts because the author really packs the information in, sometimes to the detriment of the plot. But when the plot got back to Claes, it was actually quite interesting. It's just too bad that there was so little plot there. It was disappointing, considering all the good things I'd heard about this book."
4,this book is incredible in every way that a book could be,This is one of the best books that I have read in a long time. It really comes to life in your mind. That is one thing that I really admire about her work. he has the ability to make it all seem so real. If anyone is interested in reading a very well-written novel involving history and fiction then this is your book. I simply cannot wait to read the rest of her books.
4,Captivating,Dorothy Dunnett lured me in and kept me captivated. You'll embark on an amazing journey reading her books. Her writing is unforgettable.
5,Start of a great set by the best historical fiction writer.,"Dorothy Dunnett was a genius at creating magnetic characters placed in real historical situations and playing out plots you simply can't put down. This 7-book saga about Nicholas Van Der Poel was her second major oeuvre; the first was the 6-book adventure of Francis Crawford, a Scottish nobleman. In Niccolo we watch the development of a peasant boy who works in a dye factory into a powerful international messenger and spy. The reader completes the book eager to move on to the second volume and see what Niccolo will get up to next."
4,"Very compelling, it meshes you to the center of intrique","I belatedly stumbled across these little gems. I have not so throughly enjoyed a book in ""ages."" The characters are disarmingly human and I found comparisons for them among people around me. You find yourself cheering for the hero, booing the villains and breathless with desire to see Nicolo succeed and surpass. The only draw back is that the plot is rather complicated and the omniscent style is sometimes difficult to follow. I did not like it when a character CLEARLY figured out something that we were left in the dark over. It was sort of like Scooby Doo and his friends solving a mystery with clues we had never seen, Jinkies. Regardless, for lovers of history it is a delightful tale and I look forward to reading all the sequels."
1,A laborious disappointment,"I'm a lover of historical fiction, especially ones set during the Middle Ages. This is the reason I pruchased Niccolo' Rising by Dorthy Dunnett. I was especially excited by the Bruges setting, as I have visited this beautiful and historic walled city a number of times. However, the novel has not lived up to expectations. It is a tedious read mostly because of Dunnett's extremely awkward writing style. In addition, she makes the story way too complicated with too many characters that are not necessary to the plot. Her descriptions of places and characters fail to give the reader adequate, let alone clear, mental pictures. It's too bad that her tedious and complicated writing style got it the way of an otherwise interesting story line. Even Hella Haassee was an easier read. I will not continue with this series of novels, and my choice for this genre remains Sharron K. Penman."
3,A real slog for 400 pages,"After hearing from so many sources how great the Dorothy Dunnett books are, I decided to start with this series because it comes chronologically first.I really did not enjoy reading this book. It took me 3 weeks to read the first 400 of 470 pages (I am generally a fast reader). How I wanted to quit. I kept reading and reading, hating the characters and wondering why DD had to torture her readers with a legion of bewildering characters traipsing back and forth across Europe in a labrynthine plot embellished with excruciating detail. Finally at about page 400 it all started to become interesting. The ending was good enough that I am actually considering reading the next in the series. But, the ending did not even begin to make up for the preceding tedium."
3,Commerce is history,"While I adored the Lymond Chronicles, I must confess that the business of business, even in the 16th century, is not actually a fascinating subject for me. For those who do appreciate a lively historical account of trading, Niccolo is for you!"
4,Business Opportunity Waiting For You,Book talks about outsourcing as one of the promising businesses of the future. This is talking about Special Skills needed to manage Strategic Sourcing. It's Like you make non core businesses of others as your core business and put in your best effort in achieving and not only achieving but achieving them efficiently. This book has covered various incidences experienced by US companies. This also highlights that 35% of the such ventures have failed in last eight years which is a shocking statistics. But this is not dicouraging as those ventures failed because they were carried hurriedly and with a very narrow objective. I have found this book worth reading for Persons with an ambition to start their own setup like this.
5,Love this,This is a great Cd. I love the music. I love her voice. It is a bit husky and a lot wonderful.
2,Hopefully will last longer than most,"Stanley and Klein USA-made tools are second to none, but their small pliers are all made in China. So far every Chinese-made hand tool I've owned has become chipped, dented or bent in short order. If it has a cutting edge you'll be lucky to get a year of moderate use out of it. I cannot find a new set of mini-pliers made in the USA, but I trusted the Stanley name and hoped for the best. These seem to be slightly sturdier than others although the spring is pretty flimsy. Time will tell."
5,Toni,"Very interesting book written by a very interesting lady. Toni's love of life and the interactions between all living beings, jumps out of the pages and leaves you wanting to live your life to the fullest, as she has! This is a book everyone should read! The title could read ""A more gentle world""."
5,Tender Book,"I found this book years ago as a Reader's Digest condensed book and had to special order the hardcover because it was out of print. No small feat as this was before the internet amazon.com! I lent my precious copy to someone and it disappeared. I was distraught. Several years later, while in a thrift store I found not one but three copies for one dollar each. Bought them all. One to keep, two to lend. Guess how many I have left? Only the one I refuse to lend out! This is an amazing book and I wish it was still in print. Absolutely an amazing story about the ""humanity"" in animals and the Helfer family who rescued the lion cub from the hunter, the abused elephant from the circus, and a black stallion from certain death. Toni's induction into Ralph's world of animals was hilarious, scary, and touching."
5,Must Have,My copy of _Curtain Call_ was stolen some years ago. I don't know what I have done without it--it's the best. It's a really fun album for any Jaco--or jazz--fan. I can't wait to get another copy.
2,Wrong band called Insurgence,I thought this was the east coast band called Insurgence. Instead it is a west coast band called Insurgence. The (east coast) Insurgence have been together since the late 80's and have several releases out. They sound somewhere between the Clash and Fugazi. This band sounds like an MTV band.I thought this cd was one of the ones I had not heard. The music on this cd is sub standard and it sounds like the new punk metal that is out everywhere. I will take the other (east coast) Insurgence anyday.
5,The best box knife ever!,"I think I've reached a new level of geekdom by reviewing a box knife. Still, I've had about every model out there and this one finally gets it right. It feels good in the hand, you don't need tools to change blades, and you can lock the blade securely with the knob so that it can't accidentally retract while you're cutting.Get one!"
2,Almost good,I read a few reviews and I should have listened. The knife has one problem - It is very difficult to slide the blade in and out. I am a pretty strong guy and it takes almost everything I've got to slide this blade in and out. So I sent it back.
2,Very strong piece of junk,"I reeeelly wanted to like this knife. But can't. I used it for about a year doing drywall, cutting carpet etc. It allows you to put a lot of pressure on the work but the blade is difficult to slide for all the reasons mentioned. But I have something to add. After forcing it open numerous time the metal blade holder starts to bend and the function just gets worse. The blade changes are also not really that fast. You can find faster. All and all Its a knife that really doesn't do anything that its designed to do well. I urge you to resist buying this product."
2,Sturdy non-functional pile of junk.,I saw one of these knives and just had to have one. should have bought the one with the fixed blade.REtracting this blade is ridiculous.Sure it can be done by working the knob but i cut one piece of drywall and had to loosen it so much to get the blade to move that the knife was ready to pop open. what a joke. Oh and my poor sore thumb from working that big knob!!!
4,"Nice knife, but not for a lefty!","I was looking for a good quality Stanley knife for my good left hand. This one is pretty good, though too big for the tool belt. Lefties stay away; every time you use it, you loosen up the lock nut!"
3,Love/ Hate relationship,"I love my pole now that its up finally after two week of sitting on my living room floor. I had to find time to get the other tools like the magnetic leveler and ladder, but what really messed things up was THE INSTRUCTIONS SUCK!!!!!! i had to watch the companies assembling video on youtube.com.... i suggest you do the same. other then that its a AWESOME buy!!!!"
1,used,This product looks used and the DVD has scratches on it. I will be putting it up up upmomentarily and will update accordingly. Even the threads look like they have alot of wear and tear :-(
4,Great buy!,"I'm taking pole fitness classes but wanted to practice anytime- without spending $300. This pole is very high quality and sturdy. I do need to tighten the pole after every workout if I do a lot of spins, but that's easy enough (my pole is on carpet, maybe a solid flooring works better?) Like others have said- I cant figure out how to put the pole into spinning mode, it seems like I'm just loosening the whole pole, so I'll keep it stationary and search for better directions for now.I don't seem to stick to the pole as well as I do to the poles in class, but well enough, and some grip stuff would fix the issue. I also recommend taking off any rings as I made a few tiny marks in my pole when I held a serious death grip during inversions. Again, nothing a little forethought wouldn't prevent.Overall this is by far the best pole I could find for the cost, and I am so pleased with the quality that I would recommend it to anyone."
3,HELP!,I am having problems with the height adjuster and the adjustment cover. The pole is loose and I paid a good amount of money to have to not work.
4,So far so good...,"After reading the other reviews, I decided to take a chance on this portable pole. I've had this pole now for a month and I'm on it at least 3 times a week. I've done all types of spins, invert and climbs. This pole has been very sturdy. I must admit I have not taken it down and put it back up. For the price, I think it's a good buy considering other similar poles are double the cost."
5,Simple and sturdy,"Some of the reviews said they had trouble installing this pole so I was a bit skeptical at first. After installing I realized they must have just been very inexperienced with installing or assembling anything at all. Very straight forward with minimal commen sense needed. I also wanted to make sure I got one rugged enough to endure excersizes and routines. Granted my girlfriend is only about 100lbs, I wanted to make sure she wasn't going to be another youtube video of pole fails. After I installed it, using about 30 foot pounds or so against the ceiling under a beam found with a stud finder, I tried it out myself. I'm only about 165lbs but even getting after it a little it didn't budge one bit. We've only had it up a few days and so far everything is still very tight. Obviously sense should tell you to inspect the pole for loosness before every use! So far so good"
3,Not ideal but okay for the price,"I needed a pole to practice inverts and releases at home. This pole is stable and safe. A few problems: hard to install the first time, couldn't get the top cover on so the greasy inner rod is exposed at the top, doesn't spin fast. In glad I have it for now but I'll definitely upgrade when I have more money."
1,many many defective parts,"The pole itself seems to be a solidly built, but so many of the parts that it came with where defective from day we got it that he pole was useless. The upper bolt that adjusts the height of the pole was defective from the day we got it and all but impossible to adjust. The hidden screws that are suppose to hold the pole when it is in the fixed position were stripped out. The company customers service was completely worthless, I called multiple times and each time got a voice mail account. I left several messages and my call where never returned. This might of been a good product had all of the parts worked."
4,"Fun to have, not easy to set up!","I don't have a lot of height to use the pole so I mostly use the pole for exercising. The other reviews are correct, it is a PAIN to set this up. You wouldn't think it would be but it is. The directions are truly worthless. Also I had to use the smaller extension as the bottom pole wouldn't fit directly into the base (but the extension would fit into the base, go figure). Also the top piece that is supposed to have the things the cover piece can latch onto was the wrong piece so I couldn't latch the cover onto it. Still glad I got it so I can use in-between classes."
4,I love it!!!,"I'm enjoying my pole. Ships quickly when you order through bargainfly. I set the pole up alone (the instructions were unclear), so it took me while. I recommend a second pair of hands to speed up the process!!! I usually stay on spin mode because it makes it a lot easier for me to do some of the moves. My only complaint is that it starts not to spin very good if I practice on it for a while. It turns but is not very fluid. If anyone else is having this problem I NEED ADVICE!!!"
3,Mehhhhhh,"Hard to set up and really heavy. Had to reinstall it twice :/ It took 3 people to get it up the first time. It's also my first pole, so if you're a newbie with it, I suggest finding something a little easier. When it's fully set up and not having problems, I'll update this and let you know if it actually works like the other reviews say"
3,No installation disc!,Can someone PLEASE help me put this up!? I am so very confused. Ive watched the video on youtube that someone else suggested. I dont know what to do with the wrenches or anything! PLEASE HELP
5,i have it up,Ok i finally got it up... But im afraid to get on it because I weigh 190 pounds and I'm afraid it might fall.
1,there is no way to install it!,"After reading all the comments, I ordered one. And I just can't install it. Top extension is just stuck and that's it. Three guys tried to do something about and failed. And there is no returns, so I just lost my money."
5,AWESOME,"My girlfriend is taking dance lessons and wanted to get a pole. This happened the same time I was moving into a new home so I had a really good excuse to install a poke in my basement. After reading just about all the amazon reviews and the youtube video (Pole Install 1-2) decide to give this a try.Install was quick and easy. Do yourself a favor and watch the youtube video ""Pole Install 1-2"". My girlfriend loves it and feels very confident on it (110lbs) and for kicks ive hung on it (210lbs)."
5,"Excellent, sturdy pole","It was a bit difficult to put up, especially as the dvd was terribly filmed and not particularly helpful, it tool three of us to figure out what goes where. The pole itself however, once up is everything it should be, definitely a good buy!"
3,Kind of iffy,"The package arrived in less than a week and seemed to be well packaged. My husband and I are setting it up right now and right off the bat I noticed some red flags, the instruction book is filled with typos and miss-spelled words, the DVD is came with told us to ignore the other DVD that was in the package but they both don't work and the disk that it said to use looks like they went to a store and picked up some blank CDS, the allan wrench doesn't even fit the hardware. Instead of sending it back across the country, we are going to try and make it worth while. I just pray it will hold up, I'm only 115 lbs but it still seems iffy. Will update when it finally gets set up correctly."
5,Mandatory book,"This is one of the classics strategy books. In my opinion as professor of strategic planning, is mandatory reading this book to understand business strategy."
5,An amazing well of wisdom,"I've heard about this book for many years and I finally got around to reading it and I am so glad I did. Yes, there are many great reviews about this book and I can hardly add something new but I felt it necessary to emphasize how important it is to read this book if you are in business. The beauty of Porter's ideas are that they can be applied to your own specific business or division or they can be applied to your overall company. Competition is universal and that's what makes Porter's wisdom so important. I enjoyed his analysis of watching your competitors actions and also I found his comments about being mindful of your suppliers very useful too. It's just such a useful and important book that everyone should be revisiting it every few years."
1,From Strategy to Marketing,"Even though Porter is supposed to be a strategy intellectual, I truly believe that he is truly a marvelous marketing guru. If not, how to explain that we buy several of his books with the same collection of lousy, repeated, common sense ideas?"
5,Must read for undergraduates considering strategy consulting,"I was told to read this book by a management consultant when I expressed interest in the profession. It's excellent. It really helped me organize my thoughts when I analyzed cases in case interviews. I can definitely see why it is held in such high-esteem. If you are an undergraduate thinking about doing an analyst program in management consulting, this book is well worth your money."
5,Timeless classic,"'Competitive Strategy' (along with Porter's 'Competitive Advantage' & 'Competitive Advantage of Nations') have remained as the 'classic' work on business strategy. Although the businesss world has evolved significantly, I find the framework & analysis of the book to still be greatly applicable & comprehensive."
5,"If you have to read one book on Strategy, read this one.","I've read this book many times and in each one I discover new things. Having used Michael Porter's theory to analyse the long term performance of the Brazilian Apparel Industry , the theory has been fully validated to even predict future financial results."
2,presenting the obvious,The book just organizes and presents what is obvious to any intelligent person. It does not give you any new perspective or anything you could not think about your self. They did a good job to put together a lot of obvious concepts and present them in a well organized way.
5,Very valuable book for business leaders and entrepeneurs.,Understanding the strengths an weaknesses of your competition is the key to just about any field where success is winning over someone else. This book does an excellent job of showing how to evaluate your own strengths and limitations. Finding un-tapped markets and finding the best strategy to tap into them is what this book is about. The book also shows the pitfalls you can get into if you don't focus your market and market to everyone. Highly recommended to business students as well as seasoned businessmen. The sound basics taught in this book can improve the probability of success in your pursuits of profits.
2,Concepts great -- writing barely readable,"Thank goodness there have been so many articles written that regurgitate Porter's ideas. I'd read many of them before reading his book, and looked forward to reading the original material. Talk about painful!!! Long, long, long lists in sentences (reminiscent of the ""begat"" sections in the Bible), passive voice for no good reason, examples that are vague and unenlightening. Clearly, the concepts Porter preaches are wonderful. I just don't see why he makes it such a chore to learn them."
5,Mrs. V.,"Extremely happy with this product. Definitely adds volume and bounce to my fine, thin hair. Remember that volumizers cut down on shine, if this is important to you...however, I really can't say I see much difference in this area. Will definitely purchase again!"
4,Good stuff.,"I got little sample bottles of this stuff from a hotel in Vancouver, BC. I really like how clean my hair felt afterwards, and that it felt bouncier as well (can your hair feel bouncier?) Left my scalp feeling a little tight a couple of times, but once I had gone through the bottles, my hair/scalp had gotten used to the ingredients.Not my favorite volumizing shampoo, that is reserved for Redkens Bodyfull line, but the closest thing to a runner up other than Aussie."
3,Just ok for short term,"It gives volume, but my hair feels almost coated after using it for a while. It almost feels dirty. Maybe if you alternate it with a different shampoo it would be ok, but after using it for a couple months I quit."
3,Nothing special,I never write reviews but after reading the opinions of others on this item I wonder if folks who have an interest in the company wrote the reviews. I have very fine thinning hair...this shampoo offered no volume to my hair.
5,Great rotor for 2004 Acura TL,"These are well made rotors at a good price. Like the coating on the non-friction portion of the rotor. Hopefully it will keep it looking good and rust free for some time. These are held onto the hub with 2 phillips head screws. Do yourself a favor and get an impact screwdriver from Amazon as well. I purchased this oneOTC 4608 3/8"" Impact Driver"
2,Amazing Alley is not so Amazing,"She's too hard to operate and CONSTANTLY program...she never stays programmed and a child cannot play with her alone, which was my reasoning for purchasing the doll to occupy time a little without ""I need help""...But Allay, cause more stress, what a MESS!"
1,problem with batteries overheating,make sure you check the batteries in this doll they over heat and may cause a fire or the batteries to explode. The acid then can harm a child and cause serious injury. We tried to return the doll to K B toys and they were sold out. So we are stuck with a defective toy.
2,gets boring after a while,Many years ago my mother bought this doll for me when I was a preteen. I found that after a while the doll gets boring. She repeats the same things over and over again. A regular doll is much more fun. I would suggest that parents buy thier daughters an american girl doll rather than this doll. The one star reviews are right about the doll's hair being very messy.
2,NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!!,"SANTA BOUGHT THIS AS A GIFT,AND I WISH I COULD RETURN IT.IT IS SO HARD FOR ME OR MY DAUGHTER TO WORK.SHE HAS PLAYED WITH IT MAYBE 10 MINUTES SINCE SHE GOT IT.THE ACCESSORIES ARE TOO HARD TO ATTATCH TO THE ALMOST ""CLOSED"" HAND.IT TAKES YOU FOREVER TO GET THEM IN AND IT IS VERY FRUSTRATING.MY DAUGHTER IS 8 AND CAN NOT GET THEM IN!I THINK THIS DOLL WAS TOO OVERLLY PRICED AND ADVERTISED.I THINK A LIL GIRL WOULD ENJOY A PLAIN BABY MUCH MORE THAN THIS HEAVY ,BATTERY OPERATED DOLL THAT IS TOO COMPLICATED."
3,I bought this doll for my 4 year old,...It is very complicated for my 4 year old.My husband found it difficult to even program.I ended up programing it myself!She pushes her around in a stroller rather than really using all of the programs or stories that came with it.I could have bought a [inexpensive] doll for her to push in a stroller.I would not purchase this for anyone under 6.Danielle(mommy of 5)
2,Not good for the 360,I purchased this headset to replace the crappy one that came with my Xbox 360. There are several things that stand out in my mind for why this headset is not for the 360.1.) The audio cables that are part of the headset have no where to plug into the 360.2.) There is no way to mute the mic when your on Xbox Live fragging other players.3.) You have to have this thing plugged into the wall to provide the power it needs for the headphones. The cable for this is not very long either... 2 negatives.So if your looking for a headset for the 360... keep on looking because this one doesn't cut it.
2,head phones that last you 6 months,"They have thrown ""360"" into the title of these headphones since they were 1st released. It originally came out for the xbox. I bought these because the wireless ones only offered stereo. Also, the price at Best Buy was only $35.00 at the time. Now that they have added ""360"" to the title they went up a little.I was a little uncertin about making this purchase because all over gaming forums, people had a common complaint. After 6 months they quit working. Low and behold after 6 months they quit working.Don't get me wrong, when working they were great. I could hear the direction some one was coming toward me in a FPS perfectly. I can say it gave me an edge over others. But near its final days, i could tell a loss in quality.Do yourself a favor and get Audio Extreme AX360 Optical Gaming Headset by Trittion."
4,would make a terrific movie!,"If you liked 39 Steps, The Saint in New York and other vintage smoothies, you'll love this cosmopolitan globe trotting detective as he solves the mystery and triumphs over evil while still having time for a relaxing mazagran (Algerian iced coffee) on a terrace in Monte Carlo. A fun read"
3,A so-so Dracula story,"I've read a lot of glowing reviews of SWORD OF DRACULA. So glowing, in fact, that I think I must have read a different comic. SWORD OF DRACULA is mildly diverting, but I didn't find in it something worthy of all the mountains of praise that's been heaped upon it.It's not bad, and in places has some interesting things to bring to the Dracula mythos, but the story doesn't have the propulsion it needs, and the artwork on the whole is a let-down. As a huge Dracula fan, I was expecting a bit more creativity and style."
5,"Succinct, thorough and utterly invaluable.","As a proxy specialist in the tech. support field, I find Ari's book to be the definitive reference for the ""nuts and bolts"" of proxy servers. It contains a detailed overview of the http protocol, as well as explanations of such proxy functions as garbage collection, caching, reverse proxying and proxy arrays. Also, it gives real life case studies of proxy situations as well as troubleshooting tips. The lead programmer of Netscape's proxy server has written a concise, detailed reference for any proxy admin, webmaster or support tech."
2,Only good for beginners,"This is a good book for beginners, but if you are a professional looking for any kind of deployment or reference material, you're probably better off saving your money and reading whitepapers available from any proxy vendor (CacheFlow, Inktomi, Network Appliance) web site."
2,Too elementry - for no experienced beginner only,"If you have no experience in Internet network technology then read this book for basic terminologies and overview; otherwise, you will be disappointed because this book lack of depth in all areas. For example, load-balancing chapter only consists of nine pages including tables, sidebar, and sample JavaScript. If this book were printed in regular textbook font then this chapter would be only 3 pages in length.."
5,Tapestries of the Heart,A great collection of poems. Absolutely a wonderful book to have around. The book has a wide variety of poems from different authors from the US and Europe. Some poems willmake you cry others will make you laugh. Positively a great book.
4,Great for the Price,"I wanted to add some sound to our Kawasaki Mule (which is like a 4wd gas powered golf cart). I didn't want to build a speaker box for regular car speakers so I decided to try some smaller outdoor speakers. I hooked a pair of these up to a lower end Kenwood 4x50 watt car stereo/CD/mp3 player. These speakers sound great. I've had them for about a month now and they handle the rough, dusty roads on our place without any problem. They seem pretty well made."
2,Disappointed,"These speakers work ok, and handle lots of power, but the sound reproduction is not very good. They are supposed to be three-way speakers, but the higher notes like cymbals aren't there, and compared to my $50 Jensens in the basement, these speakers sound like a very cheap boombox.I realize that these are very low-price speakers, but I bought them because the rave reviews made me think I was going to get something as good as my relatively cheap Jensens.Usually with a 2-way or a 3-way speaker, you can put your ear in front of the tweeter and hear all the highs, but I'm not sure the tweeters are even functional.That said, the cases are reasonable quality and it comes with nice mounting brackets and I will keep them. But they were not the bargain I was hoping for."
4,audio source= good speaker for the $,"Great speaker for the money. Placed a pair in my kitchen and under eave on my deck. If you are looking to rattle the windows with bass, these are not the speakers for you. You could probably work a sub-woofer in with them and really punch it up a notch. Mounting brackets and connection clips were a little on the cheap side but they work fine and its a small sacrifice for the savings. They seem to handle the weather fairly well if you place them in semi-protected areas. Overall, pretty good deal for the money."
4,good option for the money,"clear sound, no problems with installation, very satisfied with it.I don't have too much sound quality requirements, but the sound is very clear."
4,nice little speakers,"I bought these speakers for my backyard.I was very happy with the sound. Im run them with a little 50 watt amp. they sound great for the price.I was very pleased, I looked at speakers in 50watt range. I was looking at $75.00 price tag.If your looking for tons of bass this speaker not for you.The price and sound a good deal."
3,"Good sound, metal rusts...","I bought these speakers for my pool deck (I live in Florida). I mounted them to my stucco-covered walls using toggle bolts to attach the included brackets. These little speakers look great, and really have decent bass response considering their size. [It probably helped they were mounted in corners.]I am greatly disappointed by the rusting of the metal face, though. They have only been out for about six months and the mesh cover is already rusting. Outdoor speakers should not have this issue - stainless or galvanized steel should have been used for the mesh and then painted.I would rate these four stars for sound, but only three because of the poor weathering."
2,Weak midrange - worse bass,I puchased the LS 100's to get a decent speaker for a great price. I was disappointed. I knew the bass response would not be astonding but it was almost non existant. The midrange and the highs are scratchy.I would not recommend the speakers for anything other than talk radio.
4,OK,"There are a lot of instructions on this product, although complicated at first, if you follow the instructions correctly and take your time to read them, it will work.The package come with the included sensors already paired with the base, so, all I needed to do was to change the passwords and include my phone numbers.When it calls me, I can hear what is going on ONLY if the alarm is in the silent mode, since it has a pretty loud noise coming from the base (where the mic is).The door sensor works pretty good, every time I forgot to disarm, it goes off. The motion detector, it is not the most reliable, but it also works, I believe the reliability has to do with the fact that it seems to read the environment every 5 seconds or so.I live in a small apartment, and I don't know what is the actual range of these devices and cannot say if they work well in large houses/apartments.So far, it is working OK."
1,Get Less Than What You Pay For,"The instructions for this product are terrible and make little or no sense. The ""chapters"" follow no logic and it was written by someone who does not speak fluent English as seen by the multiple spelling and grammar mistakes.Though I was able to get the basic features to work with this alarm, I was not able to program the phone features. You cannot remotely access the alarm by phone if you have a home answering machine.On two occations the alarm went off for no reason(not armed) most likely due to radio frequency interference.The entire unite shuts off without an alarm sounding if you simply unplug it from the wall, so I am not sure why it has rechargable batteries.Nobody answers the toll free customer service number and they have yet to respond to my voicemail."
1,Need to return,"I need to return this item. It says it's wireless, but you need a landline to connect it to. We do not have a landline, that's why we thought is was wireless, like a wireless phone."
1,"it was not what i was looking for, just fall short of a lot of things poor.","They didn't have in the stuff I was looking forIf u have plan to use this just be sure that u use this in a dorm room withPeople because the out side world can't hear it when its set off,Just poor!!!!!!!! I still have it setting in the box justTo show u what I think of it meaning less.......Ike abbottSt kitts"
4,not an easy setup but...,"ok so its not a 1-2-3 your done setup you must read the manual 2 or even 3 times once you do get it,its a snap to setup!only took me an hour to get very thing going i mean its not the best one out there but the best one for the price i think. dose what i want it to do protech my home and gives me a little peace of mind,the system is loud when it dose go off and i like the fact it calls people(btw that works really well) so anyway if your looking for a home alarm with out breaking the bank this is the system for you"
4,As good as I wanted,You dont need to be a NASA scientist to install it. Just read carefully the instructions before use it. that's all I did.About the system is good enough to keep safe my office. It works great and I have no problems with it. Is not the best system but is affordable and a good complement to your business security officer guard.
4,Security is Secure,Great product....have not figured out how to stop it from beeping while in idle...have to unplug it when I am at home
4,Air man system good for diy,This system is very nice. I have 3 sensors in different rooms and one door sensor. I bought 2 sensors seperately. The thing I like about this system is when I am away it will call me if there are any intruders. So this system will enhance your security. The only think I did not like about this system is that the directions are difficult to understand. It took me 15-20 minutes to set this up to call and buzz if triped. I would recomend to a friend.
2,good but this seller not good,this item look like a toy not sound a lot and i thought i bought the securityman that look like the picture that bring antenna this just coming without them thats why i said that is not the real one anyways just do not trust what the picture look and seller said.
1,Poor quality,There's no good reception between the system and the other devices. The program got crazy twice a week. Is not a good quality product
5,a progressive melting pot with hip hop back beats...,"this release takes you on a whimsical and curious musical journey, which finds allan holdsworth unleashing both in a neo-classical suite on piccolo guitar--blowing like coltrane over tuvan throat singers... hoard laying down lush textures with keyboards and chapman stick... Holdsworth wails over a bluesy, infectuous electronic shuffle which morphs into some UK-esque changes and a ferocious solo--all framed by an underground LA rapper, DJ 4Zone... what comes out of the mix may offend your purist prog sensibilities... and lose you in low-tech home-studio jamz... but like the best modern music it challenges boundaries and only a few tracks fail to transport you to neverland. Several tracks feature some of Holdworth's most impressive playing ever--over compositions crafted to highlight his genius..."
5,Traveller,The book is in excellent shape and 1/3 of the cost anywhere else! Just started but I'm sure I'll really enjoy it!
4,Traveller--history from a warhorse's point of view,"Excellent Civil War historical background and realistic viewpoint from an animal perspective, insightful as only an animal close to its human can be! Old Southern language is somewhat hard to follow at first but gets easier with continued reading and makes it very authentic and ""in the moment in time""."
1,Traveler,"Horrible, horses speak plain english, just like we do. Forced myself to read the first 100 pages, the slang is just dreadful and can't get past that enough to bother reading anything more! love Richard Adams other books terribly dissapointed in this one!"
3,"Interesting novel, but flawed execution","""Traveller"" is an interesting attempt at telling the story of the Civil War, and of Robert E. Lee from a different perspective. It ultimately fails to produce anything memorable. Basically, Traveller believes that his Master can do no wrong, and believes that the South won the war. The book contradicts itself, and I found Traveller to be quite annoying. I never knew horses could be such know-it-alls."
5,For Barbara De Angeles fans and people who want LOVE!,I really enjoyed this tape set because of the process of learning how to create better questions and asking them.What would it be like if you created a set ofPOWER QUESTIONS that could instantly change your life?The interview with De Angeles will provide the listener with an insight into her drive as a relationship expert.
4,Exactly how it looks in the picture.,"Excuse the english, i'm a huge fan of tool colombian. I decided to purchase this ""hoodie"" on amazon just based on the picture available on the product page. I was not desapointed, the size was right, the cotton fabric is soft and cozy specially on the inside, and the art printed in front and back its identical of how is depicted on the picture as I said.I would buy other garment this way in the future."
3,Tool Sweat,"Sweatshirt was beautiful -- purchased it for my son for Christmas.But, it was way too small in the neck and hood areas and I have to return it. There are no other sizes available so it will have to be a full return, not an exchange.... yuck."
3,Zimmer not right for this movie,"Hans Zimmer, who has had only a few truly GOOD scores (As Good As It Gets being the best), makes a weak effort at establishing atmospherics and mood to the film. His music, which expresses more of a love theme-feeling, is just off when put with the actions of the movie. Someone else could have pulled this off a hell of a lot better, I'm sure."
2,SOUNTRACK BLUESSSSS,"ALTHOUGH THE MUSIC PRESENTED ON THIS CD IS BEAUTIFUL--IT WAS BEAUTIFULLY BORING TO ME.... PERHAPS I WOULD OF PREFERRED MORE INTENSE MUSICAL SCORES OR SELECTIONS AND OR VARIETY...THE MOVIE WAS A LOT TASTIER, DEEPER AND DARKER AND MORE PASSIONATE IT ITS ESSENCE...HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE A DIE-HARD ZIMMER FAN--BUY IT!!!!!"
1,No Thanks!,"I'm a huge fan of Hans Zimmer's, but I unfortunately saw ""Hannibal"" on TV the other night. That was the most disgusting piece of [junk] ever made! Not even scary, just sickening! The millions of dollars it cost to make this [junk] could have gone to build a hospital or something of VALUE! It was like the producers must have had the intellects of 14 year old boys, drunk, and sitting around a campfire seeing who could out-gross who! How many future psychotics did this movie pander to? Shame on Ridley Scott (formerly my favorite director) for making a stinking serial killer a ""super-hero"" of sorts with his ability to always out-think us poor mortals. The music was beautiful, but I won't buy the score because I'll always be thinking that someone made a movie out of this dreck."
2,musical score,"I really enjoyed the film so was looking forward to the music score. It was a bit disappointing, because it contained dialogue also."
3,Could have been a little darker...,"Hans Zimmer is great. The movie is awesome. Sir Anthony Hopkins brilliant and Julianne, mmh... delicious. But, do lyrics really belong on a soundtrack recording ? Honestly, those lyrics were great in the movie, why didn't they leave it with that ? The score aint so bad, but I'd say it could have been darker here and there, especially when it tends to turn to mush that we had in ""Bridges of Madison County"" (Which was great, too). I'll buy the score, as soon as there is a version without any lyrics. Then again, I'm still waiting for a ""score-only"" copy of ""Seven""."
5,Notes on the HANNIBAL Soundtrack,"(from Sierra Vista AZ)People who are understandably reluctant to go to a film like HANNIBAL might assume that they wouldn't like the music either. But films that deal with serial killers often have sublime music.For example, COPYCAT with Sigourney Weaver & Holly Hunter,features Gabriel Faure's ""Im Paradisum""(""in Heaven"") from his REQUIEM which plays while forensic photos of victims are examined.HANNIBAL's music is similarly sublime & beautiful, & intelligently used.Because this film concerns, among other things, unrequited love in which the lover loves from afar, it is thematically appropriate that Patrick Cassidy's music ""Vide cor meum"" (""see my heart"") is used since its words are those of the great Italian Renaissance poet, Dante Alighieri, who loved his muse, Beatrice, from afar. This music is transcendent & indescribably beautiful. The words from Dante's work, LA VITA NUOVA (""my new life"")are discussed in the film by Dr. Lechter played by Sir Anthony Hopkins."
3,Poor Treatment of Great Music,"I certainly have no complaints about the score itself; it was impressive, even beautiful in some cases, such as the last two pieces; ""To Every Captive Soul"", and ""Vide Cor Meum"", which were very moving.Unfortunately, the inclusion of Anthony Hopkins monologue from the movie detracted from the very reason for buying the soundtrack in the first place. For myself, if I want to hear Anthony Hopkins, I will rent the movie in DVD again.The biggest tragedy in this CD is the extensive use, again, of movie dialogue and monologue by Sir Anthony during the piece: ""Let My Home Be My Gallows"". This would have been wonderful to listen to just as music.But if this is why you are buying this CD, you will have to put up with another bad marketing decision from yet another producer who doesent really understand the kind of people who would buy this kind of soundtrack."
3,Elegant Distress,"Hans Zimmer is one of the best soundtrack composers working today. Whatever you think of Gladiator, his score glistens at every turn, and is the perfect setting for Lisa Gerard's woozier escapades. (What her warbling was doing as part of The Insider soundtrack is another review entirely!). The music of Hannibal fits the high gothic romance of the film itself (which is what both the novel and the movie are; not a thriller!), careening from musique concrete to arias to string quartets. Stripped of the visuals, the score creates its own elegant distress, except for the intrusion of Sir Anthony Hopkin's recitations from the film. Love or hate the film (I'm a fan), Hannibal the soundtrack is its own creepy experience."
5,"Dark, moody, utterly brilliant - and I hate classical","I'm not a fan of classical music. I don't much care for opera, either. When an album that's musically based primarily around classical and opera pieces captivates me to the point that it receives multiple listens on a daily basis, I know I've found a gem.Fans of dark music will find plenty to like about Hannibal. Fans of the movie (of which I'm one) will also enjoy the apperance of Sir Anthony Hopkins on a number of the pieces. Admittedly, it seems gimmicky, but this is definitely more than an excuse to throw some sound bites in with the music. The sampled dialogue works well as an integral part of the album.This album is not haunting in the same way as, say, Coil's ""Hellraiser Themes."" It won't disturb you. But it's definitely dark, brooding, and a bit forbidding. In other words, it's brilliant."
4,"Clinical in tone, but accurate, true and useful","Written by a British social worker as a thesis, this book necessarily has an academic tone, but it remains valuable nonetheless. Birthmother grief and the lifelong implications of relinquishment are accurately portrayed through case studies and interviews. It's a valuable addition to adoption literature and useful for the serious student of birthmothers."
1,Great coaster for a cold beer,"If you are looking for a great read at an interesting value, look elsewhere. This goes to show you that anyone with a box of crayons and a pack of construction paper can write a book. Great minds have been published and never read while this tawdy piece of trash actually made it into print. I hope the author isn't out to much money for the printing costs of this book."
1,a ripoff of a Stewart and Fonda,THIS IS A BLATANT RIPOFF OF A JAMES STEWART AND HENRY FONDA IN A GENE KELLEY DIRECTED MOVIE CALLED CHEYENNE SOCIAL CLUB! THATS IS THE FOUNDATION FOR THIS STOLEN IDEA OF A NOVEL. AND ITS OK BUT NOT ANYWHERE NEAR AS GOOD AS THE MOVIE. SHAME SHAME SHAME THE AUTHOR SHOULD BE HORSEWHIP. HES NOTHING BUT A TENDERFOOT AND A PLAGARIST.KUDOS ON THE AUTHOR HIDING IT WELL.THE AUTHOR SHOULD DO THE ONLY DECENT THING AND PUT A RIFLE IN HIS MOUTH AND DO A HEMINGWAY.
5,Shoulder Wrap,"My shoulder had been hurting for months, I knew it needed ice, but have you ever tried to ace bandage ice to your shoulder by yourself, sure my can help me but she's not with me 24 hours a day. Besides when you do get help the ice always seems to fall out of place.This product is great, it was easy to put on (by yourself) and you can sit or still move around, drive, work, etc... and it stays in place. I read one review that the corners of the ice packs were uncomfortable, because I read that I folded the corners under so that they would be rounded and I've never had problems."
5,shoulder wrap,"This product is exceptional. The wrap is easily utilized, and there is no problem putting it on."
1,don't buy a powermatic,"I didn't buy my saw through Amazon and have no beef with them. I bought a used 2 or 3 year old Powermatic saw that seemed to be almost unused. I bought it because of it's reputation. Bad idea. The quick release didn't work which makes it impossible to change blades. Long story short, I got the blade changed and while using it, something snapped and the upper wheel slammed into the shroud. I never had any problems with my old Delta that I had for 5 years.I took it to the local Powermantic service center, they kept it a week, gave it back. First cut I tried, same thing happened again. So, I called Powermatic's service technician. They were of no help, just said to order parts. Couldn't tell me why the release and tensioner wasn't working. Faulted me for buying a used saw. Hopfully, if you buy a Powermatic it runs well because repair help is hard to find."
2,Keep looking,"I purchased this bandsaw 3 years ago. The fence is not well designed. The locking mechanism uses a plastic pad which holds the fence in place but the plastic pad fell off Shortly after I purchased the saw. Sure, you can glue the plastic pad back on and keep going but for a grand you would expect a better fence and locking mechanism.The carter quick release just broke recently while tightening the blade. A few of the gear teeth dropped out of the bottom of the release mechanism so now I will need to follow up with Powermatic to get it fixed.I purchased Powermatic because I thought they set the standard. I don't use this tool very often and several things are broken and it isnt operating right now. It was a waste of my money."
2,Fly in the ointment,"I hate to be the ""fly in the ointment"" for this machine but I was really disappointed in a machine for which I considered I paid top dollar. (For a 14"" machine). In addition to sketchy assembly instructions, I was also missing a few bolts and had to revert to my jar of leftovers. When the time came to install the belt I found that the motor pulley was out of parallel with the saw pulley ... It seems the lower moter bracket was welded to the frame out of square. I was able to remedy the situation by putting a nut behind one of the mounting bolts and bending/twisting the motor bracket. Something I might expect to do on a ""bottom of the line"" machine. The machine runs well and cuts great (with a new blade) but already one of the (rear blade support) roller bearings has frozen up. Needless to say I was greatly disappointed in this machine."
5,"Great saw, smooth as silk","Have had this baby for about a month, along with the riser block which increases my capacity by about 6 inches (band switches up to a 105""). I've resawed 10.5"" wide cherry with this and it didn't choke one bit, cuts were very smooth. Quick release makes blade changes a snap.My only improvement would be a higher fence - but this problem was easily solved with a fence made from canvas micarta (flat and doesn't warp) and 3 bolts. The built in dust blower works great and so does the worklight. I'm very satisfied with my purchase and would definitely buy again."
3,disappointed,"First let me say that I've been a HUGE Teddy Penergrass fan for more years than I care to think about. When I saw he had a Christmas album out I was thrilled. After listening to it, however, I was less than thrilled...in fact I was very disappointed. Save your money, this was not his best effort!"
4,Lover's Silhouette,"I fell in lover with the talent of Larry Dunn while he was one of the original members of Earth Wind & Fire playing keyboard. I really became aware of his outstanding musical talent when he recorded with the group Caldera, a kind of a new aged, jazz-Latin sound. My favorite recording being fron the album, Ancient Source (the song Sky Island). One of the greatest tragedies was the disband of Caldera. The Caldera sound has been somewhat recaptured in the Larry Dunn Orchestra. Though the Larry Dunn Orchestra sound may not be Caldera, I would still say that all in all it is certainly a good album. I have recently purchased this album along with their albun N2 The Journey. I recommend both of these albums if you like this New aged Soul, sometimes, Latin Jazz sound; I think you will enjoy it!"
1,A waste of money,"This book was a disappointment. Rather than give any sort of fresh or new material, the author just rehashes old out-dated accusations. The analysis shows a clear political bias and is poorly supported. If you are at all interested in a true fair analysis of the topic, don't waste your money on this book."
4,Neat and effective Distribution Amplifier,Even though this distribution amplifier is a little expensive it does exactly what the manufacture says it will do. It allows you to do a quite neat installation of a distribution to 6 different Televisions. The amplification is noiseless and operates quite cool so it should last a long time. I would buy it again.
3,Not OEM,"Great product for the price. Fast shipping and would recommend to any one else, but if you can get the OEM rebuilt somewhere then do that first."
4,Get out your grass skirt!,"This is a great recipe book for tiki drinks you'll love in any time of the year. ;-) I wished it had listed more food recipes than drinks, but they are still all very tasty. I suggest getting this book if you are big on theme parties and need some amazing recipes to wow your guests. Yum yum!"
3,Not as Much Fun as the Title Promises,"The Instro-Hipsters a Go-Go! series are a solid collection of 1960's and early 1970's instrumentals that would not be out of place in a low budget action thriller, cold war spy thriller and cop dramas - where the streets are dirty, the cops not much cleaner and it's always the hippy drug dealer that did it :-)But it's not as much fun as the title promises - most tracks tend to fall into the generic - not bad but nothing great. They are solid instrumental tracks that run the gauntlet from 1960's spy brassy tracks to fuzztone guitars for gritty cop dramas.Most of the performers are not very well known so this is a great opportunity to get access to tracks not easily found find elsewhere but if you want the fun, slightly kitschy brassy and over the top 1960's cinema tracks that you are probably looking for (and what the title implies) - a better bet are the Italian cinema collections like EASY TEMPO or BEAT AT CINECITTA.Get those first and then come back for these."
1,Five stars for an incomprehensible mess?,"You have GOT to be kidding me. Even my wife - who will lick the screen whenever Hugh Jackman is on it - agreed with me that this film has no story. Oh, sure, Jackman and Weisz give some moving performances whenever the film comes close to having a coherent thought but that coherency never lasts more than a few moments and it certainly is utterly missing when it tries to tie in ""the future"".Considering we were a potentially sympathetic audience because of my being diagnosed with stage four cancer back in '06 and statistically given two years to live (not done yet!) we had expected to be captivated by this film.Didn't happen.Although pretty to look at, The Fountain sputters and comes up as dry as a West Texas cattle draw in August. Pass on it, your time is better spent elsewhere."
1,the worst movie i have seen in a while,"This is quite possibly the largest pile of high-brow drivel I've ever seen. I understand the deep, symbolic meaning of the movie and I can't help but say ""so what?"" Yes, the movie is stylish and with stars like Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz you'd think this movie wouldn't have been so terrible...but it was. Oh, Wolverine, I hardly know thee!"
1,boooooooooring...,"Sometimes a great deal of time, money, and imagination is simply wasted, all good intentions notwithstanding.This is, without question, one of those times."
1,Not Worth The Time,I am usually leery of a movie that starts with a killing. This movie was too dark for my liking. I shouldn't have wasted my time.
3,Interesting,A little strange but interesting. It was cheap and probably worth the small investment. My wife gave up after the first five minuets.
1,Pretentious and self-important,"I fell for all the rave reviews of this movie and sat through the whole thing. It makes me feel kind of sick that I will never get that hour and forty minutes back. I find it heinous that anyone would speak of this mess and of 2001: A Space Odyssey in the same sentence. This movie is very earnest, even overly so, as it beats the viewer over the head with its precious three-part allegory. It would be a noble experiment if not for the utterly inane third story. The movie's not too hard to understand, it just isn't worth the time. Completely overrated. Watch 2001 again instead."
1,Bore me to death,Unless you have a dying spouse do not watch this. The director must have been high when he made this. I found myself looking for something else to do because the movie was so lame. I was surprised Hugh Jackman would be in such a boring movie.
1,This is the worst movie I have ever seen,"Whenever I receive the, ""What is the worst movie you have ever seen"" question, I always provide the title of this movie thanks to its confusing story and depressing content. I'd rather paint my house than watch this movie and I hate painting my house."
1,Minus 5,"Enternal life would not get me these 2 hours back. If you take drugs you might enjoy this... that would be the only way... and I have doubts about that. Do not believe any good reviews, remember someone out there likedIshtar."
1,One of the worst movies of all time The Fouintain ...Spews,"the title says it all. Save your money, don't rent this. Even for $.99 it was a wasre of money. Despite the 1hr 37 minutes of lousy movie does't really seem like it is that long because the same lousy clips are shown over and over again just to reinforce the agony of watching this film."
3,NOT ONE OF MY TOP 500!,It went a little off the India religion side for me. If you didn't know at least something... about it... you would be confused.
1,Could use the Fountain of Youth to return my lost two hours,The clash of ideas between wanting to bring back someone from the dead and living forever to meet such a goal made the entire movie line very weak.The acting was punishing to view and the lines could have been written better if they had hired someone to narrate an MMA fight scene.Just awful.
3,Interesting Movie - No Extra Features,This was an interesting movie with some good visuals. The plot was a little hard to follow. I understood the two time-lines easily but the third bald man in the bubble was less clear to me. I read some other reviews and it was still not particularly clear despite the fact that I can usually follow the plot-lines of all but the most obscure movies (Naked Lunch stumped me a decade or more ago as well).Despite the high cost of the HD DVD there were not extra features.
2,Purposelessly Artsy-Fartsey,"I don't mind artsey-fartsey as long as it has a point. This movie was essentially about some guy's wife dying of cancer and should have been billed as such. The fountain is just a metaphor for the main character's ""crusade"" to save his wife. Its a movie about things we all have gone or will go through at some point, over dramatized and not very interesting. I think this movie could have saved itself if the main character would have withdrawn to his fantasy world for example, in order to save himself the pain of his wife's death - or something else out of the ordinary. But this is a movie about mundane things, covered up with an artsey-fartsey perfume to make it look deeper. If you're looking for a sci-fi or fantasy flick, this isn't one. If you're looking for movies that deal with the subject of death, there are several better than this one; the notebook for example."
4,awesome movie,"I love this movie. My only complaint is that the DVD seemed a little dark on my TV. I have never had that kind of problem before, so I assume that there was some sort of adjustment issue. I also recommend buying the movie soundtrack."
3,Something is missing,"I really wanted to love this movie. I really did. And it's far from terrible ... in fact, aesthetically, it's a gorgeous film, beautiful shot and art-directed, with a haunting musical score. Hugh Jackson and Rachel Weisz give great performances and have good chemistry. But something was just missing. I'm not even sure what, but it just didn't draw me in. I was hoping to be moved, provoked and inspired by this film, but I just wasn't. It certainly wasn't insincere, schlocky, or trite. It just didn't make the leap from interesting to resonant.I'd call this a bold, ambitious effort by a talented director who will surely produce more great films (like ""Requiem for a Dream"") in the future."
3,Spiritual and Beautiful,"This movie has wonderful acting and beautiful images. If you love movies that leave you thinking, then you will definitely like this one. I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it. It just left me thinking about it over and over again. A very spiritual and moving movie."
1,Simple....DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME,I tried to sit there painfully trying to get into this movie for about 40 minutes and I think I wasted 40 minutes of my life.
2,An Unpleasant Suprise,"I was very disappointed in ""The Fountain"". I thought it would be much better than it was because it is a film by Darren Aronofsky who was the writer and directer of ""Pi"" an excellent film. ""The Fountain"" appears disjointed in its rambling story of a hero (Hugh Jackman) trying to protect his love interest (Rachel Weisz). Unfortunately the film is not equal to the talent of the two stars. The scenery and special effects are positives for this film."
3,Beautiful and mesmerizing but ultimately unsatisfying,"This movie grabbed me right from the ""git go"", and it kept my attention right to the end. The end, however, did not provide any closure at all, and for people who are ""closure freaks"" this is bound to be rather annoying. This is much like the movie 2001: the ending means whatever it means to you. If you like talking about movies, this one will give you several lattes worth of material.So, kudos for the stunning visuals, music score, Hugh Jackman's intensity and Rachel Weisz's adorability, and the mythology that ties the three threads of all this eye and ear candy together. But, seeing it once I doubt I'll ever want to see it again."
2,confusing plot line.,"I was very disapointed with this film. The primise is ok, man tries to save dieing wife, but there are too many 'dream sequences' that really destroy the movie. A serious and sad subject like the one tackled here are not my favorite, but other reviews gave it good marks so I tried it. the biggest disconect for me was the confusing dream scenes, they seemed to distract rather than add to the plot of the movie. I did not seem to get a better understanding of the characters from the dream sequences, but rather got bored and wished they would end. If you could return an opened DVD this one would be sent back."
1,Bad Movie,I had the displeasure of watching this movie after it came out and I could not believe how boring and strange it was. The name Hugh Jackman will draw people to this expecting something much different than what it really is. I personally don't know anyone that thought this was a good movie and there have been jokes between my friends and I about burning the dvd to ash. I cant think of any movies I have seen in my life that have bored me more than this one. These 5 star reviews for The Fountain just make me shake my head...
1,A pot smokers dream,"This movie is so out of this world it's hard to take seriously. I was bored out of my mind, and felt violated after the feature.The only reason why I'm taking the time to review this film is because I saw it on HD DVD most popular list. If you're looking to purchase a HD DVD I'd say skip this. The NIN concert is great reference material."
1,Confusing and disapointing,"when i saw the preview to this movie i thought it would be excellent, but i was wrong it was boring and on top of that it was confussing for me. I will have to give it credit on a good story but was made wrong."
5,A super-rare breed of film,"Anyone without a broader spiritual view than traditional western theology will find much of this film to be nonsensical. Notice reviews with reference to time travel, that is not at all what is happening in this film. It is so rare that a film of this nature, with high production values, is made. Just imagine someone with the guts to produce a serious film, with a real budget, with a theme such as this: the concept of the Tree of Life, synonymous with the fabled Fountain of Youth which gives eternal life, is an ever present reality. And this is the primary revelation waiting on every human being. Pretty ambitious and bold,....... no? A marvelous job of creative filming and story telling that will not be appreciated by the masses, and they knew that going in........ BRAVO."
3,"it's ok, if you understand it","This is what i think: Hugh is seeking a cure to keep people alive, and he finds it. That's all there is to it. Notice how he asks the other doctors to find out everything they can about the tree that cures cancer or brain tumors. He eventually finds a way to beat death, and he injects himself with the serum. He's the last man on earth apparently, and he is forced to sit around with this tree until the end of time, remembering is wife, and imagining the story that she wrote, and apparently they start meshing together because he's been thinking of these things for a thousand years or so. That's why the director of the film refers to the bubble as a ""spaceship"" in the bonus features on the dvd. He's literally immortal, flying on a spaceship or....something. there's a lot of loose ends no doubt. I didn't say i liked the movie."
3,Beautiful and strange,I think I would have enjoyed this movie alot more if it wasn't trying so hard to be artsy. But it was enjoyable and bizarre in it's own way.Recommended if anything to show off the blue-ray capabilities of a pretty movie.
2,Incomprehensible albeit beautiful nonsense,"Beautiful, incomprehensible nonsense. Hugh Jackman has become unstuck in time. It's as if someone took ""Slaughterhouse Five"", ""Medicine Man"", ""Love Story"", ""The Fountain of Youth"",and ""Tenchi Muyo"", threw 'em all in the spin blender and hit ""Frappe"".And... you won't be prepared for the Spanish Inquisition! Yes, they threw that in there too... to no purpose. Watch if you dare."
1,Weird and Confusing,"These days it's very typical of the movie industry to use special effects to try to make up for a bad story, acting, script, etc. This terrible movie is a perfect example of that. Not recommended."
1,Makes you think...,"This movie makes you think... ""Why did I spend an hour and a half of my like watching this""?Yes, some of the elements were visually entertaining, but I got tired of watching Hugh Jackman floating around in his bubble after about 30 minutes. I really have no clue what this movie was trying to say, but then I'm a drug-free individual... Perhaps one needs a little organic help to make sense of it."
1,Hmmmm,"Not Much I can say other than a must see ... for people who like watching paint dry ... its like pulling teeth...The movie is about dealing with death, but the cover and description is very misleading...Ive just wasted over a hr of my life and my brain hurts ...My copy is ready for ebay :("
1,Future Hope,The ONLY hope for this film is that one day the crew from Mystery Science Theater 3000 MIGHT be able to make it entertaining.
1,"I Loves Movies, Hated This One",I really love movies. They are my number one hobby. But I hated this one. No point at all.
1,"Pretentious, Pointless and Pathetic","Don't waste your money or time. There really isn't any story line. No plot. No moral guidance. The hero does not save the girl, he may not even have saved the monkey. There are a lot of views of a bald hero confined to a mystic bubble floating through space towards a ""dying star"" while everything else is floating in the other direction. This is a clear case of ""emperor's new clothes."""
1,Boring? No. Incomprehensible? Yes,"I was intrigued enough to finish the film, but kept waiting for it to make some kind of sense. It never did."
2,get over it...,"What a pretentious movie! It takes so many misdirected turns to keep up with it's artsy vision that it frustrates the viewer to a point where you just don't care anymore. The spiritual metaphors felt so overdone that I couldn't help myself from rolling my eyes repeatedly. After Requiem for A Dream, this was such A HUGE dissapointment. I will give it this, the visuals are stunning... unfortunately I didn't care enough at that point for it to save this movie. Skip it."
1,Worst movie ever and it featured Hugh Jackman...What was he thinking!?!,"This is one of the worst film ever. Unfortunately, I did not read the reviews first before renting it. You probably have to be a Zen Buddhist to appreciate this one...total waste of time!!!"
1,this film couldn't carry stanley kubrick's jock-strap!,"I didn't care that lots of people forwarned me that this film sucked. I hear that 2001: a space odyssey had lots of detractors when it was first released. so i was hoping for a misunderstood masterpiece. well, once again in life, my hopes were dashed. whereas 2001 (stanley kubrick's masterpiece) is understated, with brilliant low-key performances by the actors, this is overly-melodramatic B-movie mediocrity. I turned it off at the 80 minute mark. i didn't care about these people at all, because they obviously were not real people. they were actors through and through. bad actors to boot. stiff, bad actors in a silly movie that could have been made for TV back in the 70'S. nothing about this film was convincing. it was not hard to follow, it just stunk. if you like this sort of thing, more power to you. i wish you well. I just found it a waste of time."
5,The cinematography and soundtrack alone make this worth watching.,"This movie struck a deep chord in me emotionally. It truly is a sensual rollercoaster. Something akin to a psychadelic experience. From a man's perspective this film tore my heart open and split it to pieces. I'd say its the best love story I have seen. Visually it is breathtaking, emotionally, it is powerful. See it."
3,THREE STORIES IN ONE,"2006. Written and directed by Darren Aronofsky. I'm not at all convinced by the film but I bow down in front of the originality of the screenplay. In a few years, we'll remember this film as a curiosity. Nothing more."
3,Watch Undisturbed ...,"This is a rather complicated story, so if you are easily distracted, or don't have the time to focus on the story ... wait to watch it another time. It is a very interesting story, rather engaging, and sad. I liked it, the acting was great. But, since I was unable to totally concentrate on the story myself ... I cannot at this time give it a higher mark. Maybe some other time... This may be fun to watch during a Thunder Storm."
3,"Well, my girlfriend liked it...","I didn't really like this movie...I feel the targeted audience for this movie didn't include me. I am a very thoughtful person, but saying this movie was coherent and meaningful would be a stretch. The visuals were good...the acting was good...I just didn't enjoy it. The best way I can put it is that when the movie was over I thought to myself...""Ok...and that two hours was for what?"" My girlfriend cried a few times and she said it was good...so take that any which way you will."
2,A good looking cliche',"This is your standard ""love conquers all"" story with a slick veneer of fantasy and sci-fi effects that fail to elevate the film beyond a dull and monotonous romance yarn.The triptych storyline just plain fails to deliver. It basically tells the same story three times and there is never any correlation between the three tellings. The ending will leave you wondering just what was the point of all of it."
4,"If you like subtle, well-written movies...","IN SHORT: This movie is phenomenal to movie goers like me. I am all about subtle truths and well-written twists in a movie. This movie is meant to be on the edge of your understanding, as its topic of love, loss, and death are well-told and from a more fresh perspective. Understand, though, it is told through two stories that tie together and some of the end sequence does require some thinking to fully understand, but this movie does not leave anything unexplained. Just make sure the volume is up and the subtitles are on if you have troubles sometimes hearing quieter dialog. If you pay attention to every detail, this movie will not disappoint.RECOMMENDED: Looking for a cognitive drama? Yes."
2,Deliberately Heavy Handed and Obtuse,"I thought the movie was visually and thematically interesting, but I really didn't enjoy the method of story telling Aronofsky used, or the heavy handedness he employed in trying to get us to understand his point.I left feeling as though the separate time lines had been shuffled so as to deliberately obfuscate the themes. Opening with the Conquistador thread, for example, killed my suspension of disbelief with all of its glaring historical flaws until it was later framed as fictional. Something was always being hidden from the viewers, but these secrets never carried much 'pow' upon revelation. It's as though Aronofsky believes that by presenting a good theme in a confusing manner it somehow becomes better.I'm a fan of obfuscation when it makes a better movie, such as Memento, but this one just didn't do it for me. If you liked the presentation that's fine, but people who didn't aren't necessarily idiots."
1,The Fountain HD DVD combo,About 20 minutes into the hd dvd the dvd froze. I had to watch it in the regular mode which was a bummer. Otherwise the movie was great. It would have been phenomenal in HD. Very much in spirit like Neverending Story but for adults.
1,Watch this movie,Watch this movie only to see how horrible it is. I'm sorry but I thought movies were for entertainment. The only brain power that I should be using is for studying and for school. I do not think that a movie should give you a headache. Anyone that tries to be so deep is full of it.
3,"Technically good, but...","would I watch it again? No. Great actors, solid acting, great visuals, unusual (for a movie) idea--just not very satisfying. Could be I just don't get it (though I think I do), but it didn't do it for me."
2,The Fountain,"I sorry but ""The Emperor is Naked"" - this comment given to all the pretentious people who watched the movie & won't admit at it's end they looked at each other with a blank expression. Yes it has wonderfull imagery & good acting, which doesn't change the fact that you would not know half of the ""presumed story"" without reading the plot line on the back of the dvd case. After which it's still like getting the answer for that crossword puzzle clue at which point you call the author a cheat & liar, as the given clue could never have lead to the stated word. Bottom line, over an hour & a half of my life I'll never get back wasted"
2,I bought this without seeing it first,"The trailer for this movie is a little deceiving (I guess most trailers are really). Let's get the positives out the way: Hugh Jackman is excellent in this movie. The visuals are great. The concept was novel and it's different than most movies. Rachel Weisz was ""mostly"" good. The negatives: I think the movie could've been great if the overall sequence of events had meshed together better. The music was okay - not enough variation. It has most of the right pieces, but I just don't think the movie overall was constructed well enough. I don't think there will be a repeat viewing from me. I would suggest a rental for most people that are interested."
2,confusing,"i bought this movie on blu-ray, which has stunning video quality. but, this movie was one of those weird ones that is nearly impossible to understand the first time you watch it. i hope you enjoy it more than i did!"
1,Don't bother,This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Confusing and unintelligible and I certainly wondered why someone like Hugh Jackman would have ever become involved with it. I threw away the DVD after I watched it!
1,Weird!,It is a hard movie to follow because it moves back and forth in time so often. It is to say the least...a very very weird movie. It was confusing at times and it was too slow of a pace for me. I would not recommend this movie at all.
1,What???,I don't know what this movie was about. I doubt even the director got it! It seemed like they put it all in a pot and shook it up. The end being a movie called the fountain. Don't waste time or money!
1,buyer beware,"I have never wrote a review, but I had to on this one. I bought this movie because of the ratings I read on this movie. Big mistake, and I will never do it again. The movie was stupid, pointless, and endless. I will never make this mistake again."
2,Poor Blu Ray Transfer,"A very interesting and thought provoking film, let down by a poor quality video transfer. The blacks are awful, often motion leaves trails behind and some scenes just don't look very HD at all. Wait for a better quality Blu Ray."
2,"Cool visuals, nothing else","In general I like slow paced films, and I'm a fan of the actors in this movie, so I took a chance and purchased it at a low price. This is a very difficult movie to watch. Don't believe the other reviews that compare this to Kubrick. I love Kubrick movies and they all make sense. I don't know what's going on in this film. I would give it one star, but the visuals are good. Wow was this film BORING."
2,I've seen MUCH better from both actors,"I'm not sure what exactly I was expecting, but I sure didn't expect what this movie delivered. Both Rachel Weisz and Hugh Jackman have been in much better films than this. The basic premise was fine - it was the story telling I could have done without. I walked away feeling like I'd seen a great story in a very hollow film - & that I'd completely wasted 2 hours."
2,Meandering stream,"This was more like a music video than a movie. Ambient music, trippy visuals, simplistic, vague, predictable story. At least it's only about 95 minutes long. I can't think of a soul I'd recommend this to and I'd never sit through it again. Scenes are shown over and over and some shots linger when there is no need, simply to lengthen it because the story is so simple. Very disappointing."
2,A dud,I gave it 2 stars - 1 for being in HD and a 2nd star for being a visually beautiful film. That's as far as it goes. The story is ... well what story? Well acted but ....
2,Lame,"After starting us within the supposed 'real world', we're exposed to layers of narrative dross that conflates actual experience with what I can best describe as South Asian Hindu yogic crappola.Not sure what the disease of thinking should be called.Nice visuals, but think of the implications.-r.c."
3,"Great visuals, not so great story","Whomever is responsible for the visuals did a fantastic job in this film. I hope their talent get used in other films.The story would seem to have potential, but as told in this film, is disappointing.The imagined science in this film is simple nonsense - standard fare, unfortunately.... but the visuals are great."
1,Skip this movie,"While I loved 2001 which many people seem to be comparing this movie to, I was continually frustrated and annoyed. I like the tie in between the book, current times, and past times. The problem is I don't really feel there was much of a story being told in any of the time periods and that their connection was flimsy at best. A repeat of certain scenes with small changes just further convoluted the story. Maybe I am missing some hidden meaning or message, maybe this is just not my type of film, or maybe it was just a poorly written story executed without real purpose or clarity. I am going with the latter."
3,Hmm,"It came in perfect condition, but I wish I knew what plays it. Ive tried everything, and NOTHING will play this movie...so..big fail"
4,great looking movie in hd,great looking movie in hd! over all the story is good but seemed short me!! i felt like the movie could have been longer and established the story better but overall it looks and sounds great! a wonderful addition to your hd dvd collection
4,Interesting but not engrossing,"It seemed to be slightly confused in its presentation of themes, not just the fluttering to 3 different times, and it did not tie together any new philosophy of life, death, and rebirth. A good but unsatisfying film."
3,Tough to Follow,Was loosing interest until near the end. It's a movie that I would't watch again and would probably trade in for something else
4,aranovsky's cinema,The fountain is a movie which does take a lot of risks - and for that alone it deserves our attention.. Not quite as perfect as we would have liked it to be - the movie takes a rather direct look into the mouth of death - and our obsession with forstalling the inevitable.. it also seems to be a spiritual quest of sorts.. It seems that there is a sort of transcendence in the end which was really the only way to pull the story together in a way that would be pleasing.. I have to say i enjoyed the movie despite of its shortcomings.. Most of all i admire it for its uniqueness..
3,Great Idea gone bad?,"By the end of the movie you can pretty much figure out what is going on or be able to tell what the filmmaker is trying to convey to the audience, but until then the movie is just a jumbled mess with three storylines...and each story itself jumping around different time periods, with many scenes being played 3-4 times over again. It's hard to tell what is real and what may be fiction and is very confusing, very boring....but is visually appealing."
2,Had the potential to be interesting but was drawn out and pretentious in the end.,It seemed at times like the surrealism of this movie was forced weakening the story as it removes you too far from the actual story-line.
2,Slow Slow Slow and Slow,"If you want to watch a slow movie with a script that was written by someone with ADD, this the movie for you. It has great visuals entwined with chaos."
2,This Movie Stinks,"Do not believe the hype for this movie. Some say it's a masterpiece, epic, beyond our times...all I can truthfully say is this movie stinks."
2,no,"no need to see this, move along. ok sure there's some neat effects and ideas, but for the most part this movie is an over wrought trainwreck of new agey stuff and half baked philosophy"
1,Similar to Plan 9,"""Without reference, stupid, unfulfilling and a waste of time,"" is how I would rate this ""paycheck"" for the actors. What utter non-sense and intellectual bankruptcy contrived this movie should have titled it, ""Plan 10 From Outer Space."" It is the farce of Hulu's commercials to turn your mind to mush. I watched it, painfully because I could not believe that such a miscue of adventure could exist.Lest I forget, it is also very, very boring and oh, on top of that just plain weak.Hope that clears it up for anyone else foolish enough (like me) to suffer it. I should have been paid to watch it. So don't waste your time unless someone pays you to see it. It isn't worth a dime. Make sure you get some serious cash in the deal."
1,Maybe I watched the wrong movie,"A friend gave me this movie to watch. Maybe I'm not that smart, but I spent the entire movie going, ""huh?"" ""What the heck is going on?"" Like I said maybe I watched a different movie then what everyone else is reviewing and calling a masterpiece. I could have sworn it said the fountain in the opening credits........."
1,Eternal waste of time,"Started not bad but quickly deteriorated in new age inspired hogwash.Incoherrent, and plain silly.Acting... what acting? There was nothing to act = waste of actors.Plot? what plot. series of strange events none of which made me care about.I wasted my time watching it, hoping that at some point the movie will make sense. Or perhaps there will be a great satisfactory ending.Nope. None of the above.I am giving this disk to a thrift store, perhaps some stoned new-ager can afford it for 25 cents they will sell it for.Save your time and donate it BEFORE watching..."
1,Do not waste your time,I wish I had followed the kindly advice of the lady at the video store who told me this movie was horrible and not to rent it.Due to the fact I love both of the leads I thought surely I would like it.Video lady was right. Do not waste your time on this it is bizarre and it is 2 hours you cannot get back.
1,The Fountain,"It was cleverly advertised, and protrayed in pre-views. The pre-veiws were verymisleafing and did not cature the essance of the film. Parents if your children see this film, please view it with them. While an interesting saga of the bridge from life through death to life, the advertising will capture unwitting parents and under 18 age groups not prepared for the movie content because of its advertising."
2,The Fountain (Widescreen Edition),"I WAS A LITTLE LOST WITH THE MOVIE. THE TREE OF LIFE AND A CURE FOR ALL. SOMETHING IS MISSING. IT IS NOT THE ACTING, WHICH THE ACTORS ARE ALL SUPERB, BUT THE STORY LINE AND PLOT. I COULDN'T FINISH THE MOVIE. THE BEST WAY TO DESCRIBE IT IS WATCH THE CELL. IF YOU LIKE THAT TYPE OF MOVIE FINE, BUT SAVE YOUR MONEY."
1,I missed it,"If there was some hidden meaning or message in the disjumbled manner in which the incoherent scenes were shown, then I missed it. I feel like I watched three completely seperate stories, and yet none of them had an intelligbile beginning or an ending. You were left wondering why you watched this movie. The acting was superb in this movie, but somewhere on his journey, the director forgot a movie needs to have a point. It's so much more enjoyable to engage in something when there is some point to it. I have no idea what the point of this movie was, nor was I able to follow the ""acid trip"" that was this movie. The ending was as unfullfilling and confusing as the beginning was, which is how I would have to sum this movie up. (Great acting, but I have no idea why they were acting or which of the 3 incomplete story lines was the point of this movie.)"
1,Terrible,"Don't waste your time. I think the people who reviewed this movie and called it epic or a masterpiece didn't really get it either. There is nothing to ""get"". A disjointed mess."
1,***WARNING***,"I don't usually do this but I feel obligated to my fellow human beings to warn you that this movie is TERRIBLE! I am a college educated man and I have no clue what I just got finished watching! What are these positive reviews about??? After watching this crap I am so angry with myself for even purchasing this! I would LOVE to give this movie away to anyone interested, although it would not be doing anyone a favor. You have been warned, STAY AWAY!And 4 stars??? Pshhhhhh."
1,Better To Go To An Art Gallery,"This movie was beautiful, and that's all that touched me. I found no attraction to the content, or any desire to make sense of the loose symboolism. You're better of going to an art gallery, or cirque du soleil show than sitting through this movie in my opinion. Next time I'm in a deeply introspective & docile mood I may give this movie another chance, just to be fair."
2,Huh?,"When this movie came out in theaters,it was marketed as a love story that spanned the millenia.Now,I consider myself to be an intelligent person.But as I watched the film,I kept thinking,'What's going on?Have I missed something?'After the lights came up,someone in front of my mother and I turned around and said,""What just happened here?""The only reason I'm giving this 2 stars is for the leads.Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weiz are both very talented,and deserve better."
2,Trite,"Considering the rich topic and the possibilities, it somehow just ended up even more trite for failing to deliver anything of interest whatsoever. Wasting these two competent actors with this meaningless and unengaging work just made it worse."
3,very deep and introspective,"I had to watch this for a philosophy class where we are discussing death. The movie is dark with quite a lot of symbolism. The characters were played very well by the actors, the sets and design awesome. It's just that it is rather a downer pertaining to subject matter but was appropriate to watch for further discussion of death and how it is portrayed and the reactions of the characters of the film."
1,Wasted two hours of my life,This is one of the worst movies I’ve ever seen. I wasted two hours of my life that I can never get back. I should have stuck to my twenty minute rule and I could have lived with that. I’m going to slash my wrists now.
4,"nice, profound","lots of metaphor and the special effects are beautiful too. very deep, thought-provoking storyline. I didn't like the chimpanzee laboratory experiments though. it triggered my animal rights issues, but this was the only thing ""wrong"" about the movie and why I gave it 4 stars."
2,beauitful but couldn't comprehend,I loved the soundtrack and the visuals but I honestly couldn't follow the movie.After 1 hour of watching I still didn't know what was going on. Good luck
1,The Fountain of Dsapointment,"This movie seemed to have some potential visually. Unfortunately the writer could not narrow down which of the three stories he wanted to use so they all were all crammed together. This created a combination of fragmented unrelated and very overdramatized scenes. If you rent ""The Fountain"" bring a lifejacket because you may drown in dissapointment."
1,Depressing movie,By the time this was over my husband and I were both confused and extremelly depressed.
1,Don't Waste Your Time on this one!,"Way slow and not complete. The ""teaser"" said something about time travel or living forever?? There was no connection at all about this. Very deceiving and in the end after you have been soooo patient, What has this guy learned??? Skip this one. Big time."
4,See it before you buy it,"Great movie IMO, but surely not for everyone, it is at times very pretentious, but the movie itself is intriguing if you can actually grasp the plot, which flies over the heads of most it seems. Good flick for watching with your signifigant other, it's real chick flick romance and a big dose of science fiction, you can't find a better middle ground than that if you're arguing what to watch on movie night.P.S. pay attn to the whole movie or you're sure to miss something, lose track of the story and just drop asleep after too long, whether it's good or bad is really a preference and you should probably rent it before buying it, but one thing is for sure, it is very different from any other movie you've seen...."
1,Do not waste your money or your time,"Confusing, boring and a complete waste of time. Thankfully, it only cost me a $1 to rent this film. The film looked interesting, so I rented it. Why Hugh Jackman made this film, only he knows. Money? A good premise that goes no where. It would have been a great story if it was just about him looking for the fountain and not all this time stuff. Plants come out of Hugh at the end? What does that mean. He's bald in one section and we have no idea what he is doing, why he is talking to the tree. It just moves from time line to time line without saying why. No wonder the project was shut down for a few years. No wonder this movie died at the box office. For me, this is the worst movie I have ever seen. I think one star is giving it to much credit. Not even worth the $1 it cost to rent."
4,A Different Kind of Fountain,"Once again, Aronofsky delivers a thought provoking and well crafted film. Most viewers will find their appreciation growing with a second or third look. During my own 1st viewing, i found the story complex & challenging, and the photography mesmerizing. Somewhat like Izzy's unfinished journal, it helps once you know how the movie resolves in the end. For the second viewing you will be more able to focus on nuance in scene & setting, and enjoy how little hints relate to the greater story. It is a fine movie for a relaxing & worthwhile evening."
5,The Fountain was AWESOME!!!,"The director is smarter than most, so his movies get complicated and difficult, but are always worth watching.What a great way of presenting a potentially impossible story story to tell.5 StarsJeremy"
4,one amazing journey,"The Fountain is an interesting movie, and for much of it, quite confusing.When the movie begins, you are treated to a variety of events that unfold in a very confusing way, and you begin to wonder if it's possible to catch up to everything going on. However, after a while, all the events seem to come together and flow with the story. It's one of those movies that takes a lot of time and patience to understand.It's a story about living forever. Or rather, trying desperately to find a way to live forever, through a series of fairy tale events and strange happenings. The acting is really good, the story is interesting, and the magical feeling of living forever is a great touch. I recommend it."
2,Could not get into this movie.,"Just not my type of flick. Could not get into it. Did not watch it until the end but think the plot was evident after about 30 minutes. Others may find it interesting, just not me."
2,"Odd movie, I like sci-fi, but this show is hard to follow","Odd movie, I always like sci-fi shows. This show is hard to follow, turned off before the end of show."
2,Probably made more sense on paper,"Ambitious but deeply flawed attempt from Darren Aronofsky, who fared better with PI. Hugh Jackman did the best he could with the confusing, slow, dull script, without much help from the miscast Rachel Weisz. Apparently she had a brain tumor and he was trying to find a way to save her--but then it turns out she's writing a novel with the same title as the film, and it spans the lives of two similar people from 1500 AD to 2000 AD to 2500 AD. And there are Mayan things and a star and a fountain of youth tree, and ......I don't know. Who cares? I can usually follow convoluted plots, but this was just too much."
2,"Good movie, poor SKU","The Fountain is a good movie, and worth re-watching. It is a sort of fantasy/allegory that focuses a lot more on style than character development, but I still found the plot to be coherent and the movie compelling enough to care about what was going on. You need to be in a contemplative, patient mood to watch this movie: it is not exactly action-packed, and the themes and characterization are subtle.My principle complaint is that this edition is a major disappointment. Underwhelming visuals, essentially devoid of special features, nothing packed in the box except the disc. When I buy a Blu-ray movie I am expecting the definitive edition for the price I am being charged. That means carefully mastered visuals, well-done commentary tracks, deleted scenes. I am really expecting more than what may as well be a recording of the movie off HBO."
3,A cool cascade,"Although The Fountain is impressive visually, and inventive in scope, the film fails to produce a cohesive whole that really gels. Because of this the movie is something of a cold exercise in form, and as such fails to engage the viewer in the way intended by the makers. It also seems a little pretentious at times, particularly towards the end when Jackman experiences a Buddha-esque transcendence. This is an interesting and highly creative tour-de-force but not the moving love story it sets out to be. In fact, the most moving aspect of he film is the score, without which the movie would come close to an emotional vacuum."
1,Worst movie for 2007 yet!,"Horrible script, completely incoherent. The audience simply cannot understand what the meaning of the movie is about. The cinematography is meant to awe (along with the trailer) but it dosent compensate for the very very poor film. It's also sad to see good actors cast in such shoddy films. I guess this is what you get when you give hippie wanna be's who've taken way to much mushrooms a few million dollars.Save yourself the money and don't believe the trailer. This is quite possibly the worst movie for 2007 yet."
1,Crap.,"I did not not get a chance to see this in the theater. When I read about the story, I thought that this was a movie based on a short story about a wounded solider in WWI who is being treated by a nurse, who he has loved over 1000 years in other lives (which for the life of me, I can't remember the name of.) If I was casting THAT movie, Jackman and Weisz would be top picks. Alas, I ordered this film site unseen, and it stinks. The Acting is good, the sets and photography are the best, and the soundtrack was excellent. The story? What, all Faiths are good EXCEPT anything with Christ? I would put it up for sale for the shipping and packing costs alone, but I can't in good faith inflict this on someone else."
2,"No, no, a thousand times no.","A visually engaging, pretentious, overwrought piece of junk. Aronofsky's other work is great, but this thing stinks. Seriously."
1,Disappointing,Unfortunately this movie was one of the worst I have ever seen. Not even worth a rental.
1,Playing Mind Jive With The Viewer is Not Cool,"I don't really mind jive, if it makes sense, the way Rod Serling's mind jive made sense. I could only get through 24 minutes and that took all my patience. If you can't hook me in 25 minutes you ain't gonna hook me. This movie raised two important Questions: What was the producer thinking when he funded it; and what was I thinking when I rented. That about as metaphysical as I need be."
2,Tough to Use,"I'm not an experienced painter so I bought this tool thinking that it would make it easier to paint the trim and create straight lines, i.e., between the walls and the ceiling. In the end, I found it much easier and faster to use tape and an angled brush."
1,"Junk, makes more work, not less.","This trim-painting tool doesn't work well. I followed instructions, filled up the tube with paint, and started my trim work. The pad distributes the pain unevenly, and it started dripping quite a bit.The tube holds enough paint to cover about 6 feet. When the tube is empty, you have to remove the pad, and fill the tube up again, then put on the pad, which is filled with paint. A big mess.Not recommended. Stick with tape and an angled brush for trim work."
3,Does a good job,"I've used the Wagner version of this as well. That was a bit better than the B&D version. All told, it does a decent job. Doesn't apply a very thick layer of paint...but it is uber convenient and clean and perfect for trim work."
4,Insite on Mormon doctrine,"This work written by a former Catholic priest who converted to the LDS church and later returned to the Catholic Church is a kind description of the beliefs and ceremonies of the LDS. The beliefs are listed, explained and debunked by the author from the author's perspective (Roman Catholic) and with the tedious use of a scripture. It is both an apologetic text book and the story of one mans spiritual journey. It is a good refrence book for anyone that is interested in copmparative religion studies or for one who is being recruited by the Mormons."
4,stunning,"Have you ever been visited by fresh faced teenagers carrying the Book of Mormon? After reading Isaiah Bennett's, Inside Mormonism you will not be annoyed with them but will be filled with compassion.Although Bennet left the LDS church he hasn't written a mean, angry book. He is kind and makes a huge effort to put things gently and he makes it clear that 99% of the more lurid stories you may have heard about the temple ceremonies just are not true. However, Bennet does show that Mormonism professes things both publicly and privately that are not compatible with Christianity. It's a disturbing but quite calm and sober book that you would do well to read before inviting the missionaries back for a followup visit."
1,Total Garbage,"This guy has an axe to grind (but without a true cause) and his outlook on the mormon church is CLEARLY askew. I am a lifelong catholic and have lived near 2 Mormon families for most of my life. We have talked at length regarding their views several times since I have known them and I can tell you this: Mr. Bennett's opinions (though he states them as fact), could not be further from the truth. Did you get your poor feelings hurt by a mormon Mr. Bennett?... or were you just interested in making a dishonest buck?If you want to know what a mormon really believes you could just ask one of them. As in all religions, I'm sure you have good mormons and bad ones, but generally I have found that they are extremely kind and genuine group of Christian people. And their beliefs are NOT as Bennett says they are."
1,Pretty Ordinary Anti-Mormon Propaganda,"Except for its Catholic slant -- most such books are written by evangelical or fundamentalist Protestants (of the kind who typically don't like Catholicism) -- this is pretty much standard, run of the mill anti-Mormonism. For those who like that kind of book, this is the kind of book they will like. Those who really want to understand the faith of their Mormon neighbors or family members or friends, however, will want to look elsewhere."
4,"Very Good Chair, Reasonable Price","This chair goes together effortlessly. Fit and finish was perfect. I think it took about ten minutes to assemble. Add another ten minutes to put teak oil on it (to preserve the natural wood color) and that's about it.If you plan to sit in the chair for more than about ten minutes, I'd highly recommend the Oxford chair seat cushion, your back side will be forever glad."
4,Neat Idea,This lounger is a great idea. I had seen the much more expensive ones but didn't want to buy something that might not work. So far so good. I did have to add a pillow under my stomach since I'm not a spring chicken anymore and need less curve on my back. But this will do it just fine. Now if it would just stop raining so I can use it.
2,Sent it right back.,"I'm 5'11"" and not skinny. My back gets tired when I read sitting; this seemed the most affordable redress.1. This is too short for me to lay in without my feet hanging off and the aluminum bar at the end from causing my shins great discomfort. Major design flaw! I estimate the woman in the stock photo is 5'5"" or shorter.2. The face-support cushions are very cheap and not comfortable. Not sure what I expected for this price, but I expected some amount of comfort for more than five minutes.3. The arm holes are such as to cut off circulation when I lay there and try to read.In short, my feet, arms, and face are greatly discomforted by this chair intended for greater comfort. I feel like a sucker, and now I'm out return shipping as well since it's not Amazon's fault I bought an unfortunate product..."
1,crappy chair,"supposed to be rated to hold like over 200 lbs or something. my husband weighs maybe 170, he sat back on the chair and the thing ripped. we had it for maybe a week, what a piece of crap. don't waste your money."
2,Flimsy and Unsafe,This chair is not well made; pay attention to the fact that the chaise only has two stands; the absence of a footer under the part of the chair where the feet rests is a major deficiency. It is difficult to get up without tilting over-so safety is a concern.
1,Broken and cheap,Mechanism that enables folding and locking broken and badly manufactured from inception. Would not buy. Seriously disappointed. Crappy and weak construction
2,Face down lounger,"Cheaply made. The head of the lounger slips downward snd doesn't stay up where the lounger is flat. I am only 120 lbs so there is no reason for it to not hold my head and upper body up. Face cut out is not very comfortable either. I knew the ""quality"" before I ordered it so I am the only one to blame. When is a decent company going to make these without charging an arm and a leg?"
1,Defective,"The product arrived already broken, inside an also broken box. They have covered the broken box by placing the broken box inside a bigger box."
1,Ostrich Beach Chair,The Ostrich Beach Chair is designed for a person with very short arms and a very small head. I am an average size person and cannot use it while lying on my stomach as is shown in the sketch of the product.The whole chair should have been designed to sit higher off the ground.
2,"Great idea, not well made","A full time, year round student, I had high hopes of being able to read and study while laying in the sun. I do not know if this was a faulty one or not, but the catch system failed the second day of usage, and now had to be propped up in order to use the face end. Not pleased, as I am on tight budget, and felt that this might last for a while."
5,Fabulous Chair so far,"I love my Ostrich! I bought this chaise in May and have had many comfortable days reading on the beach this summer. I primarily bought this chair because of its' face down reading option which I had not seen on a chair before or at least not at this price point. So far it has held up great, I'm an avid beach goer and I'd say I have about 18 days on it so far. It is also easy to fold up and carry and fits nicely in my car. I would certainly recommend this chair for it's comfort."
1,Vega Beach Chaise / Lounger with Face Cavaity and Back-rest Cushion - Solid Blue,"I should have read the reviews more carefully, especially the one that says it RUSTS. I ordered it April 11, 2012, and already they're rusting - in just 3 weeks. Big disappointment."
3,Use to be a favorite,"I use to love this lip balm. My recent purchase of it left me with mixed feelings.It was super thick and hard to squeeze out of the tube and it left a horrible taste on my lips. No, I am not expecting a fruit or food flavor but the flavor was not appealing at all."
2,As stuffy as a film book can be.,"Halliwell's Film Guide has some wonderful stuff in it, some great ideas (the sampling of reviews from other critics, for example). But the book is incredibly stuffy and does not give respect to horror films (Evil Dead, Braindead) or the films of David Lynch. A much less stuffy and more fun film guide is Videohound's Golden Movie Retriever."
5,THE BEST,"This is the machine you have been waiting for. It is so easy to use. It will do almost anything you can imagine in terms of still photography. It is as if you have the best digital compact camera.The quality of the DVD movies are amazing. It is like looking through the window when you watch your video on the TV. It is as close to High Defonition as I have ever seen.It is worth while to read the instruction manual first, as there are few little things that have to be done in the correct sequnece to finalise DVD's, but it is very simple.The sound is crips and clear with out any noise interuptions. I would say that this is the best DVD camcorder available at the moment."
2,Overheat,"I like Canon,that's why I choose this Canon DC40 over Sony DCR-DVD505. Very dispoint me is this Camcorder over heat the first day when I tried to download still images into my PC. Even it claims 4.3MP, the pictures quality only equal to 2MP digital camera. Make it useless.It does not support IEE firewire.It only can use DVD-R and DVD-RW. Does not support DVD+R nor DVD+RWMydvd software comes with the Camcorder have to pay for up-grade in order to transfer Video File from Camcorder to PC or Add Video file from dvd drive to PC.Very slow start.But Video quality very good."
4,Canon DC 40,"Very compact, light and easy to hold - full marks for design. Buttons etc can take a bit of getting used to, but ok once mastered. Main downside for me it only takes DVD-R/RW- and not DVD-R/RW+, bit of a problem when you pick up the wrong ones! Also, can be a problem taking it abroad - I had issues charging it as it would take a standard US to UK converter plug as the pins are slightly wider than normal US plugs."
4,Canon Camcorder,"It is a pretty good camera. Its my first camcorder, I bought it because I had a baby in October and need to capture everything, and my Nikon digital wasn't doing it for me. The optical zoom is great, its pretty easy to use, and I love that you can just press the finalize button wait a little bit and then play the dvd on the dvd player.The only negative thing is the price, it was a bit high, and Im not sure if its that much better than the other ones out there at lower prices."
2,Lacking in Features,"The camera boasts lots of features and a decent price, however Canon has omitted one very important feature that is very crucial to some users such as myself- It has no ability (per the Canon Service Reps) to have the video pass- thru without having the on-screen data shown on the recieving end (such as on a video switcher). The only way to get that data off is to RECORD your video. We needed to use the camera for sending a live video feed, but alas, we were not able to get the on screen info to not show on the final feed destination. The Canon rep said that this is the only video camera that he has seen without the proper menu options to correct this.Other than that, the video quality appeard to be very nice."
5,Another perspective,"Mr. Bennett lost a lot when he converted to Mormanism. I find it doubtful that he did that to line his pockets. I saw this first hand in my own church when one of our Deacons converted to the morman faith and ended up coming back. In both cases, Bennett's and the man I knew, they both said they got to a certain point with the Mormans and they could not continue. The Deacon I knew lost his standing in the Church and also lost touch with his own family. I will bet something similar happened to Mr. Bennett."
2,Off center.,"I would have to say that this book encourages confrontation and contention. Neither of these feelings are fruits of the Spirit of God. He seems more interested in convincing his readers that his stance is correct, than portraying a non-slanted account of the true beliefs of the Latter-day Saints. Nevertheless, this book gets a 2 because he spelled all the words correctly."
5,What a voice! Great,"I LOVE dancing to this music! Jennifer Delgado's voice is strong, upbeat and sweet- the perfect combination for dancin'. I look forward to hearing more songs from this artist! I hope to see her soon on tour- I hear her flygirls can really move!"
1,You get what you pay for,"Perhaps even the Hello Kitty sewing machine would have been better. I was raised on my mother's Singer and now use my mother-in-law's Singer. I decided to purchase a simple sewing machine just for easy hemming. After one pair of pants hemmed, this machine was unable to recover from the trauma of one job. I truly believe I did everything as instructed in the manual and the instructional DVD to no avail, and I'm not even a novice sewer. I don't think I can hand this down to my daughter to learn about sewing."
1,absolute garbage,"This is not even a toy. DO NOT waste your money on this item. Amazon will charge you to send it back which is what most will do if you expect even the lowest standards in a ""quick"" machine. Nothing about this machine functions well. Never got an even stitch or a complete row of stitches. Amazon should not carry this item, it has lowered the quality of Amazon's products in my view."
3,"good for the money, but durable?","We purchased this for our 6-year-old daughter after reading poor reviews on the ""real toy sewing machines."" This machine is working well with basic functions. We are concerned about the number of plastic parts & durability. The tension knob is also an issue, as it spins forward or backward with no indication of how far your tension is set to tight/loose. We played around to find a comfortable tension, then used a permanent marker to mark the knob. It's a great starter machine (if it survives)."
2,A little unhappy,Slightly above a toy but definately not a sewing machine for anything serious. I ended up hemming my sleeves by hand. Bobbin is loose. Doesn't pull the material through very well. Not at all what I had hoped. I will end up giving this away and buying a real sewing machine. One that will handle a hem.
3,Sewing machine review,Product delivers what it promises. The instructional video was very helpful. I would only use this for very simple stitching.
1,YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR,"Nice little machine, well designed and assembled. Has good instructions plus a great CD. However, after 5+ hrs I was not able to repair a seam in the waistband of my sweat pants. The stitches would not lock, no matter how I adjusted it. Worked great on the little swatch that came with the machine."
3,$39.00 sewinf machine,I purchased this machine to sew split seams in pants and tops. It is a $39.00 sewing machine. the bobbin is very hard to thread and you get jumbles of thread from the bobbin. Save your $39.00.
1,the sewing machine is Cheap!,"The sewing machine, is built very cheaply, does not even sew correctly, I understand i didnot pay that much, but to feel you really are just ripping people off,its an item i ended up throwing out, for it just took up space."
4,Great Value,"After considerable research, we decided to get this sewing machine for our 9-year old daughter. We feel this is the best low-cost sewing machine for the money. Although many of the components are plastic, the machine is sturdy and well made. It includes a foot-pedal, does not require batteries, and closely resembles the basic features and shape of a traditional $100+ sewing machine. I only give this item four stars because there is no light.After helping our daughter select the proper thread and tension adjustment, she has made several hats, skirts, and so on. We have also found that no matter how cheap or expensive a sewing machine is, there are going to be problems if it is your first time at sewing. Many people don't realize that there is a fair amount of knowledge and skill required to make ANY sewing machine stitch properly. If you can't get your sewing machine to stitch properly it is most likely tension setting, thread selection, etc..(...)Hope this helps !"
2,A LOT smaller than picture,"I was disappointed with the size of the actual product because it was like a toy for my younger granddaughters. Kayla and Tarra are 13, and they love my sewing machine so I thought I would buy them one for their birthdays. I wish I had paid more attention to the actual measurements because I would not have made this purchase! They both had problems getting it to sew because the thing would not make a real stitch!"
3,Getting it to work,"Got this for a 10-year-old, who is doing fine with it now that it seems to be working properly. (She is able to follow the instructions, thread the machine, etc.)We had the same trouble as CK, after following all instructions and watching the instructional DVD. Several experienced sewers tried to tweak the machine, but it would work about every other time. Tried calling the toll-free support number, but could only leave messages. (I hope someone will call back.) Finally (so far) it seems that we might have been trying to feed the material under the needle too quickly. Once we learned to guide it very gently without rushing it, the machine seems to be working fine."
2,Burned out.,"I ordered this item fully understanding that it was a beginner's sewing machine. I know it's not the heavy duty kind with bells and whistles that costs a pretty penny. So when I tested the machine on the test material that comes with it I wasn't expecting it to be the only stitches I would get out the machine. When I lifted the foot and took the sample material out and placed my material in (cotton, not a heavy material) it didn't work. I checked the plug, nothing. It simply stopped working. I sent it back in about a month ago and just got it back today. It works now, but not a highly recommended product."
3,sewing machine,delivered on time. the picture showed it can sew everything but not on thick material. overall it is economical......
2,wont work,This product doesn't work right. It wont stitch right. Do buy if you want something for your kid just to play with but don't buy if you want something that works!
2,QuickStitch is a little too Quick,"I am not into sewing, so I bought this machine for one project and it was fine, easy to use, came with good instructions and everything. A few years later, I had another project I wanted to use it for and I couldn't even get it to turn on. It's dead. It was cheap, so I can't complain too much, but keep that in mind in your decision-making."
3,Good enough,"I have some high toy standards, so I may be off base. But, it is a better value to get the larger set. The piece count includes the small items that aren't tubes. Go for the bigger one."
4,Nice sound,I have 2 of these lanzar max pro 15s on a autotek 1500 mono and it hits hard it's not a competition sub but it gets the job I have it in a sealed box and it catches the lows not a bad product I just don't see how people could bash these guys they get loud like any other woofer out there I mean hey u get what u pay for but a very dependable speaker
2,blown.. twice,"Bought two of these and hooked them up to my car only to have one blow about 2 weeks later and the other about 3 months after that. I e-mailed Lanzar and didn't get a reply. Pretty disappointed in their customer service. I know the subs were hooked up correctly because my uncle installed them with me and he has been doing installs for 15 years. This is a good product if you're on a budget, and don't push your subs very hard, but if you're looking for a high quality product for cheap, this is not the sub for you."
4,very good,i got this sub 2 months ago and love it. it hits deep on the amp that i got rite now (witch is not the rite amp for this sub)the lanzar max 2000. but it sounds great and was a good buy!
1,boo!,"i got this for my sister for christmas, i hooked it up to a 3000W audiopipe class D mono amp, it his 4 time good and it messed up its a piece of crap. dont get this subwoofer."
4,good sub,"i have had or herd just about every sub there is, and not only was the price for this woofer good but the sub was too! so i got 3 more..talk about flex man my ride looks like the doors are bout to fall off! hahalove them!"
3,"good for price, but will not buy again","I think these are great for the average person, but they seemed a little flimsy to my and they were definetly under powered. They kicked really good for about a week and then one of the two I bought blew on me. I will not be buying these in the future, I will spend a little more and get something of quality."
4,Surprisingly funny throughout....,"This was a very funny film. I was a bit sceptical at first. I've never seen any of the Stooges' feature length films, and I've never seen anything with Curly Joe. So when I saw this, I found it to be consistently funny throughout and never boring. While Curly Joe is no Curly or Shemp, he's better than Joe, and he has many fine moments spread throughout the film. The film works very well. The alien makeup is campy and very funny (deliberately so), there are some really good one liners, a great pie ""fight"", some funny use of stock footage, and a great moment when Moe ""discovers"" the Martians' plans for invading Earth. The Martians are also kind of funny in their ""banter"". If you like the Stooges, you'll like this movie. Even if you don't, you should be able to find something worthwhile here."
1,Fake Testament,"The Testament itself is a fake invented by the Swiss Fascist Francois Genoud. Hitler never gave any such Testament during this period. Look up Francois Genoud on Wikipedia and you will see what I mean, the man created fake Nazi documents to earn money to fund Arab terrorist groups.I see complaints below about this version have a White Supremacist foreward and is thus somehow tainted or spoiled. Those reviewers miss the greater point that there is no such thing as an ""unspoiled"" copy of this book since the book itself isn't real in the first place."
1,Craig Fraser is a funny man.,"But then again, I've always been amused by people with questionable sensibility.The introduction of this book is nothing more than a semi-lengthy rant by one Craig Fraser. He is very biased, glorifying Hitler as a ""phoenix in human history"" while making it clear that ""the anti-Christ Jews"" are ""poison.""The documents themselves, on the other hand, are interesting and worth looking at."
1,Out of date,"The 18th edition is hopelessly out of date. I bought it because I saw it shrink wrapped, behind the counter at B&N;, so I assumed it was current. After copying addresses from this book and sending headshots and résumés out to over 100 talent agents and casting directors for my client, more than 20% of them (so far) have come back as undeliverable, addressee unknown. Yup, I checked the returned ones for typos.Don't waste your money. Breakdown Services sells guides and address labels and guarantees they're up to date. I didn't think they'd be worth the money, but they are. (No, I don't work for BDS.)Also, the text of this book is available online if you search. No idea why -- maybe they're not publishing another edition.Best of luck in Los Angeles!"
4,A great cd,I am a dee jay and found that both cd's are excellent. it is very hard to find these songs on cd or record. This is a great party cd or dance cd. I have played the songs on here many times on the air and have used them in commercials and production spots. Definately own both volumes.
5,Loving Is Really My Game,"I`ve been addicted to the disco music of the late 70`s early 80`s for a few years now. (I`m 18 by the way) I continue to be surprised by the beauty of disco, and boy did song #4 on this cd surprise me! ""Loving Is Really My Game"" has become one of my all time favorites. It`s a disco diamond from `77.The other songs on the CD aren`t too shabby either. Classy disco, funky disco, it`s all here."
2,"The best I can say is it is MUCH better then ""54"" part one","If you must have one of the soundtracks to ""54"" then consider the second of the CD's. Not that that is saying much. The music must have played at the straight, leisure suited discos of the 70's because the heat generating, pulse pounding music I remember is mostly missing from this lukewarm retrospective.With the exception of the wonderful, ""Don't Leave Me This Way"" there will be no flashbacks to the energetic nights spent dancing under the disco ball crammed sweaty body to sweaty body just waiting for the next beat to grab the crowd and push you higher and higher.Studio 54? I don't think so. More like TGIFridays Happy Hour. Trust me, I was there!"
3,Like it!,DISCO! Is where its at!!Not my time but love the music anyhow!!This CD represents the best songs of that era!
5,A Great collection of forgotten disco,"You will not be disapointed! ""Heaven must have sent you"" is a FANTASTIC song...what beats, and what a voice on Bonnie Pointer! Other highlights are:If You Could Read My MindDisco NightsHeart of GlassTake Your Time (do it right)Fly Robin Fly"
4,one song on this soundtrack is MIA,"ok...what happened to MY favorite song in the movie ""54"", the soundtrack version of Hang On In There Baby by Johnny Bristol?!?!?! :("
4,Journey to the pass,"This Cd was when Dance music was ruling the world. Take a journey back to the time of real music, and not a bunch of noise coming out of their mouths. Music had a beat, a rhythm a style and most of all, it had class. You had to look at your best to be able to get into Studio 54. Today, even with a baseball cap and eating a microphone you can talk sing. On this CD, you had to be the best to be able to Dance, Dance, Dance. The music on this Cd will take you back in time and relive the beauty of the dance floor, lights, and heart pounding bass that MADE you dance all night. This CD does just that."
3,If you like late 70's dance music,"This version of the music from 54 is much better than the other sountrack. There are a few really good songs on there, about half of them are pretty good. The rest all sound basically the same."
3,Great quality 18/10 steel,Great quality steel with generous opening for quick drain.The screen simply sets inside of the base so you will have to pour slowly at first to make sure the screen doesn't relocate and allow unscreened product to get through.
5,Used for Straining fryer oil,The quality on this item shows. I originally purchased this to strain oil for my deep fryer. It works very well. You can see and feel the quality in the item. I was worried at first that the 2 piece design would be a problem but the mesh screen fits in very nicely to the funnel part and I have had no issues with it moving or slipping. I have had the product for over a year now and it works as well as it did the first day I got it.
5,Best Funnel I Have Ever Used,"Functional and easy to use, this is by far the best funnel I have used. I would highly recommend this funnel over the more inexpensive plastic ones that don't last over time."
5,Very nice,This is a very nice funnel. It says it's for jam which I never knew you used a strainer for jam - sorry I got side tracked. This is very well made heavy duty steel and a nice steel mesh strainer. I think it will work great for animal milking and pouring into a ball jar - which is what I'll be doing. The opening is small - but not too small -will work nicely. I measure the opening at the bottom at 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Also the handle on the side is a nice steadying feature. All in all a nice product.
3,No Longer Made In Germany!,"Having gotten stuck with so many things ""made in China"" that are stainless steel(and very poor quality), I was excited to find this, and that it was supposedly made in Germany. Alas, it used to be, but now has a little gold sticker on the box that says--you guessed it--""Made in China"". For almost $20, I expected better, and am disappointed. It looks OK, is designed quite well, but the true test is how it will hold up. Am only giving it 3 stars due to being so expensive, and made in China. After all, most of the other SS funnels (made in China) are around $10."
5,19th Century Build Quality,This is a very high quality funnel with a easily removable (and cleanable) fine screen. We really like it and will look for this brand when buying other kitchen equipment.
5,"High quality, an excellent funnel","I bought this funnel for homebrewing beer. The stainless steel is high grade and seems very durable. The funnel itself seems built well and the included filter should work just fine for catching left over particles from mashing.I'll use this funnel on my next batch and update if any pro or cons need to be addressed. until then, I am impressed with the quality."
4,sturdy,"I lingered for a while on this one... $20 for a funnel? I'm a food blogger, canner, kitchen dwelling momma. I spend a LOT of time looking for funnels and I hate my old plastic one. (It is olive green and literally older than I am.)I wanted a funnel that was metal for two reasons: durability and BPA concerns. This funnel will replace my cheap canning funnels, additionally the filter is perfect for making coffee! Forget the expensive coffee carafe, just add a coffee filter and voila!My only complaint is that the filter doesn't really stay in place very well."
1,don't waste your money,"this is the only buffy the vampire slayer book that i did not finish. the start was so slow and dull that i put it down and never picked it up again. my theory on any good novel is that if you cannot get me interested in the first 25 pages, then the author needs to try harder this book was a complete waste of money to me."
3,"Okay, not great",Recipes are a little too much work and contain exotic ingredients compared to what's in my fridge.
5,very interesting and useful,"There are many pianist's suggestions, directly let the reader know that how the pianist want to interpetate the music. Highly recommend!!!"
4,Valor in Gray,"VALOR IN GRAY is an attractive and well written book. Gregg S. Clemmer explains the background of the Confederate Medal of Honor then presents a brief biographical sketch of each award winner. An appendix lists the Confederate Roll of Honor. For those interested in Confederate military exploits on a personal level, this book would make a welcome addition to your library. Minor mistakes are the only thing preventing a five star rating."
5,good one,bought if for my brother in india... they love it...good product if they love the bears...good to have 1..will recommend..
1,this book sucks.,"This is the most horrible book I have ever read. I bought it thinking it would offer something, my child has lead poisoning. Good grief was this terrible. Having your kid drink their urine? Don't waste your money or your time. Lead poisoning is serious. This book does not offer any insight into the long term effects or any good advice."
1,Never Received the item,"I ordered it from Samsbzness one month ago and not received it yet... So the rating is for the service, not for the product, as I had no opportunity to try it yet."
2,A waste of money.,This is no match for a gerbil that likes to chew things up. They do not crawl inside and stay there. Our gerbil chewed it up and used it to line the inside of the ceramic acorn house in her habitat. A silly product.
1,Gone in 1 day,"Bought this for my son's gerbils. He has 2 gerbils. They completely shredded this in one day. What a waste of $7.00. The gerbils loved it, but this item is too expensive to be a 1 day ""toy."""
2,Didn't attrack my pets,My 3 russian dwafs didn't much case for this product. They are sisters and prefer the Ware Crunchy Cellulose Core Small Pet Hay Hut. All three spend their sleep time and there is still plenty of room. They like to take bedding and build up the hut to their liking.
2,Too small for my dwarf hamsters,My dwarf hamsters did not find this very interesting. The preferred their plastic hide-aways! They used it while it had the cottony stuff in it. Once that was removed (soiled) they didn't even use this as a tunnel. I don't think they found it snug enough to nest in.
2,Title track is only good song,I heard the title track on Pandora and I like it. I dint like the rest of this album.
4,Reliable,"Very strong on hotel reviews (25 pages), restaurant reviews (36 pages), plus the Frommer Best Bets for both categories. Maybe a little weak on the description of the sightseeing places of interest, being perhaps too brief sometimes, but the walking tours are very good, the shopping lists and traveler's facts are very solid and reliable.Very good pre trip book for hotel listings and walking tour ideas, not necessarily the book to carry with you in the street."
2,Glaring errors and omissions,"This book calls Caravaggio's masterpiece ""The Calling of St Matthew"" in the church of San Luigi del Francesi a fresco, which it is not. If it gets details like this wrong how many other things are incorrect? It also omits some great masterpieces. No mention is made of Santa Maria della Vittoria which houses Bernini's masterpiece ""The Ecstasy of St Theresa"" or Santa Maria degli Angeli which Michelangelo converted from the tepidarium of the Diocletian Baths. If you are interested in art go with the Fodor's guide - it also has photographs."
2,"If you want authentic, avoid the book's suggestions","Every place/ restaurant we visited that the book suggested were full of people just like us with the same books. Tourists, no one else. Maybe once the book went into print, these places got swamped with foreigners from all over the world, locals stopped coming and food quality decreased. Food was bad in all the places we tried from the book, and it is hard to screwup Italian food.It did have a good suggestion about their Happy Hour, you get free buffet with a drink. ."
4,Mower works pretty good,"Came in assembled, just filled in oil and gas and it started right up. Self propelling action helps in mowing quickly. I gave 4 stars bcos I think packaging could have been little better for a 93lb mower. But so far looks good. Also the description says 6.5hp engine, but actually its a 6.0 hp engine. I will recommend this mower for its price"
2,does not hold up,"At first installation I was totally impressed, the sound is awesome. However some other friends warned me that the plastic ring that holds the muffler will crack. Sure enough I had the head maybe 6 months and the ring cracked and that cause a rattling noise that is just unacceptable. The sad thing is that I use this drum a max of 3 times a month so this becomes an expensive proposition. I've gone back to the Aquarian SD2 and glad that I did."
5,"Thank you, sir","My first thought upon finishing this book was echoed someplace by another reviewer: ""God Bless You, M Revel"". I read it a second time just because it felt good. I've lived in the Soviet Union, and spent years in Western Europe 'but, but, butting' them too. Revel is such an apologist for the United States, it's almost embarrassing, but I agree with him completely about what's going on in Europe. He sees it so clearly, and nails it right on the head without apology or equivocation.Revel was editor of the French political weekly L'Express and is a member of the Academie Franaise."
4,Balance,"As an American living in France and as someone who tries to maintain an objective point of view of America's position in the world, I highly reccomend this book. Whether you're for or against Bush, America, globalism or capitalism this book certainly tempers the predominantly ""against"" point of view in the world today. The majority of M. Revel's statements are easily verifiable and so his conclusions can be given a relatively high degree of credibility and trustworthiness. This will certainly help you found your own well balanced and objective point of view."
3,Too Bad the sound quality isn't better,"This would be a wonderful set if the sound wasn't so poor. You're better off going with one (or both) of the 10 CD box sets entitled Arturo Benedetti Michelangelo, selling for $18.99 each, here on Amazon. That being said, with a decent EQ and turning the volume up, you can make these discs listenable, and the playing is wonderful. However, for a couple more dollars you can get over twice the music, equally, if not better played and in good sound by going for one of the other sets. By the way, disc 10 of Vol.1 and disc 1 of Vol.2 on the 10 CD sets are virtually unlistenable, but the sound on the rest is fine."
5,if you love rock and hip-hop you need this album,if you love hip-hop and hard rock than this album is for you it mixes both music styles together so well plus it also tells the dark truths of the world BUY THIS CD!
3,"talented, but a little bit cheesy","While Bionic clearly shows some musical talent, I found the rhymes on some of their songs amateurish. If you can handle hit-or-miss lyrics and religious themes to several songs it's worth listening to, otherwise take a pass."
5,Awesome,"This cd is an awesome combination of rap and rock. I have seen reviews recently that compare it to limp bizkit and linkin park. It is nowhere near either of them. The emotions that this band has in their music is unbelievable, and it is more rap than both limp bizkit and linkin park combined. This cd is real good, I recommend it to anyone looking for a true mix of rap and rock."
4,Pretty good.,"I hate to do it, but I must mention Linkin Park in this review. Imagine, if you will, a line where rap and rock come together in perfect harmony. On one side, with deeper shades of rock, is Linkin Park, and on the other side, closer to ""gangsta rap"", is Bionic Jive. Each band comes really close to the line, but neither of them is completely perfect, and that's ok. I would give Bionic Jive a new genre name: ""Ghetto Metal"". Hard stuff, and good for driving down the road blaring. Check it out, it's not really that bad."
1,VET warning!,I don't know if it works because it turns out my cat had a yeast infection in her ears. The vet said not to use any OTC mite treatments because they have been known to cause seizures.... just passing along the info.
3,MAD TOY - A Decent Story.,"I feel kind of let down. A read all the hype that preceded my purchasing of MAD TOY and thought that I was getting a true gem of a novel. However MAD TOY did not live up to its promise. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed MAD TOY but not as much as I thought that I would. I wanted to give MAD TOY four stars but I could not bring myself to do so. Three stars may not be enough; maybe three and a half stars. The story was good but I feel that something was missing - that something that makes a good novel great. I don't know what it is but I do know that I did not want more when I finished reading MAD TOY. Great novels always leave me wanting more. I would recommend Roberto Bolano instead. His2666: A NovelandThe Savage Detectives: A Novelhave that greatness I refered to. I have not felt the need to look for more of Roberto Arlt's work. I cannot give MAD TOY a whole hearted recommendation however I would say if you were given a copy by all means read it."
3,Bulky and Boring,"But I do like the large numbers.Also, the ability to switch up which of the number forms to leave blank allowed me to legitimately test my son.All in all, a decent approach to fractions and decimal points."
2,parts don't line up,"I bought this chair and the 48"" bench. The bench assembled easily and all the parts lined up. Unfortunately, the chair did not. The parts did not line up. Since the dowel rods used to assemble the chair do not come out easily, I was stuck. Fortunately, with a cushion on the chair it's hardly noticeable. If you buy this chair, I would suggest placing the pieces together to make sure they line up. Something I should've done. Once you start assembling, you can't start over. I would also suggest getting a cushion for the back. This chair is uncomfortable if you sit in it for more than 20 minutes."
3,A little rough around the edges,"All in all, you are getting what you pay for. The furniture is solid enough, but within a month, we are experiencing some big fissures developing in the wood. Nothing that will cause structural integrity issues, but bad enough that it catches your eye. Then again, we are paying about a third less than true teak stuff."
1,Bowled Over,"I order the book, but I received postcards. Returned item. Cannot rate the book as I did not receive it. I was happy with the return policy for this item."
1,It was junk,"The lid to this product was made out of cheap plastic and was broken, I came to find out before I even used it. And even if it hadn't been, it would have broken quickly because it was so flimsy. Terrible prpoduct. I would not buy another product by Avanti."
3,more than a quick reference,Coverage of SGML.Consists of three sections in which the 1st gives the background of SGML and HTML. The 2nd part talks about the languages used in case studies and it talks a bit deeper about those languages. The last part talks about some implementations of those languages.
5,Justice is served!,"The hero of this book is a villain; a very good villain who out-smarts the cops and the mob. All his jobs are pulled off without a hitch. You might even agree with him that crime really does pay. Yet lurking on the fringe is that force villains never seem to heed: karma. Early in the book, Parker gets a taste when he's not arrested for being a robber and it does make an impression on him. Not enough of an impression to change his lifestyle, though. So it's not surprising that karma smacks him again when he's not arrested as a drug dealer and he totally ignores it. I'll be interested to see if karma continues to follow Parker's path. It's an original twist of the anti-hero theme."
4,Parker doesn't pull any punches,"I was really surprised to find out this book was by Donald Westlake, who wrote the Dortmunder series, which is incredibly lighthearted and funny. This book, featuring Parker, is amoral and mean--the polar opposite of books like 'The Hot Rock.' That being said, I did enjoy it--it was fast and witty and at times disturbing, but I appreciate that Westlake, writing as Richard Stark, didn't pull any punches. Ultimately, the story feels a tiny bit thin, but as the first entry of a long series, it was good. Looking forward to reading more of these."
3,Good But Not Great,"The Hunter is loaded with action and wonderful characters. At first, I found myself comparing Parker to Lee Child's Jack Reacher: Itinerant men with no permanent residence and no permanent relationships. Of course, Parker is the antithesis to Reacher. Parker is a bad guy to Reacher's good guy. The problem with Parker is that he's a psycho, murdering people without remorse.I liked the writing and action enough to try another of Stark's books. We'll see how that goes."
2,People like it or they don't,"From looking at the other Amazon reviews on this book, it looks like people really like it, or they really don't like it. I fall into the later category.I read this story as part of a book club I attend with some friends. While they though the story was great, but I didn't care for the protagonist, his treatment of women, or the plot.On the plus side, this is a fast read, and the story moves along well enough to keep you turning the pages.On the negative side, I just felt the overall plot was unrealistic in regards to Parker's attempted murder, and his plan to get his money back from the Mob. Maybe the Mob in this story wasn't as tough as I'm used to from reading other books or watching TV and movies, but I'm thinking the Mob would send an army of people after Parker for what he did. Regardless of the cost, I think Parker would have been sleeping with the fishes by the end of the story."
2,Not worth reading,I've read it after seeingPaybackmovie with Gibson as Porter (intead of Parker). To my surprise I liked the movie much better than the book. Looks like another junk paperback.
4,The Hunter,"Found out about this series after watching Payback. Obviously the film doesn't follow the book, though I found both enjoyable."
4,Great book,"Got this book to read for a weekend camping trip. Finished it the first night. Coincidentally, it seems my timing was perfect as another Parker movie is coming out this week.If you've seen Payback, read the book."
2,This book is a waste of time and money,"If you really don't have anything else to read, read this one, nothing of what is written here can be true. The plot is the following (I will write it because this is the first review and is nothing written about this book).Parker who is a bank robber went to jail when he was betrayed by some friends. When he goes out he found those friends (of the mafia) and try to kill them. Super Parker goes for the mob himself because they owe him part of his last robbery.If you have one day at the beach without children, you can finish this book in one day."
4,Great 60's guitar stuff,Two of the best guitar groups ever on one CD at a bargain price. How could you lose?
2,dreadful book,"The sequel to his original book about growing up in 1950's Australia, the first book was quite funny and a good read.This book however is a tacked on version which was boring and generally unfunny. It droned on and on."
4,damn funny.,"If you're a tortured artist, a sucker for wit, a would-be critic, a bit of loser when it comes to attractive women, Do you have a passion for bohemian culture, want to travel around europe? Do you have a hard time trying to hold down menial jobs? Have you got a university education? Well, then ""Falling towards england"" is your book. If you've watched Clive in ""post-cards"", and remember his hillarious deadpan voice, you'll laugh out loud as you read his hard-to-put down 2nd installment within his ""unreliable memoirs"" series. If you're a bit of comedian and a bit of a geek at uni, then reading this book will help relieve the pain a little bit as James' details countless romantically inept experiences which he includes in what he calls ""Another chapeter in the history of what never happened"". pure gold.* keep an eye out for the talking book version. listening to it is damn funny."
1,CRAP!,Same problem as the person above... needle thread would not catch bobbin thread..... Do NOT waste your money on this TERRIBLE machine!
2,"Kudos for following Beethoven's tempos, but it sounds ridiculous","Though Tan's playing is fantastic, the slow movement of the piano concerto is taken so fast it is drained of all beauty, and would be comical if it weren't so aggravating. At 5:47, it is two and a half to three minutes faster than the 5 other recordings of this I have. This just doesn't work for me no matter how many times I've listened to it."
2,"Works great, FOR A MONTH!",This item worked exactly as advertised but only for a little longer than a month. Then it began having a slow leak which progressed to complete failure and it would not turn off at all. Who knows maybe I just got a bad one?
1,Disappointing results with these items,I'm disappointed with the durability of these items. I ordered two and one developed leaks after just a couple of months use. I bought another one thinking maybe I just got a defective one and it developed leaks after just a couple of months. Won't be buying any more.
2,"works- at first, then...",worked fine for awhile; then would neither come on nor turn off...i'd have to manually override...which is not much better than turning the tap itself on and off.
2,Great!...If it works,"I bought two. One works well, as described. The other had a broken knob on arrival. I got a replacement, which worked for four days and after that would not shut off. Requested replacement but was given refund, since Amazon wants to investigate the problem. I found Amazon customer service to be very user-friendly."
4,EBTG does it once again!!!,I Loved this cd's. The flavorful beAT keeps ya going. Go out and Get tHis one.
1,"Box advertises $20 off coupon, but it's expired!","Playing online with the xbox 360 has been a blast for my son, but I have to let people know that this was a real disappointment for my son. He had been checking all over for the best deal, and this one excited him the most for it promised $20 off a game on the cover. The only problem is that when we got the box, the coupon was expired over a year ago, and no was was willing to follow through with giving us $20 off a game. It was a real disappointment one that AMAZON should definetly stand up and take the blame for misleading advertising. What a disappointment for my boy."
5,Good deal for online multiplayer ---,"Honestly, I don't care about using the webcam that came with this pack, but it's still the best deal I could find, besides some ones where I was put on indefinite 'back order' for a kit without a webcam.This is an easy and convenient pack that will give you a year of online play, a headset, a webcam, and some 'xbox live marketplace' points and a couple free (if cheesy) old arcade games.It ships free with the 'super saver shipping' and arrives fairly quickly. I got mine and am waiting until HALO 3 releases before I activate my account."
4,Love the Bears,"As always the Bears have a positive approach to dealing with everyday problems. This one has a couple of really good episodes about the anxiety of starting a new school year and tackling homework.Our disk was in fair condition, had some scratches but plays fine so can't complain. That goes with the territory buying a used DVD."
2,Would have made a very good long article,"This book has a catchy title and a compelling premise, which, unfortunately, the book doesn't live up to. The organization of the book feels arbitrary and forced. The repetitive anecdotes make for a boring read from cover to cover. The chapter titled ""Biology"" is its weakest point -- a random litany of information that doesn't arrive at any particular or useful thesis. Unfortunately, this tendency to string together various historical anecdotes pervades the text. The final chapter is decent, but it's a long, irritating slog until then."
5,This SpaceShipOne DVD rocks!,"This DVD is amazing! These guys did a great job of capturing some truly historical moments. Their style isn't the most polished but that only adds to the fun and spontaneous ""you are there"" feel. This is real ""guerrilla video"". They did a great job getting behind the scenes and include a lot of extra material not directly related to SpaceShipOne but still of interest to space and aviation buffs like me. My kids loved it, too, especially the song at the end. They keep running around the house singing it and I'm having a hard time getting it out of my head. I heartily recommend this DVD to anyone insterested in SpaceShipOne and Burt Rutan's world. I found that they also have some great additional photos and video on their web site. If you're into Burt Rutan or SpaceShipOne then trust me, you'll love this DVD."
1,not what i thought,it isnt made by the crew its more like a person on the side watching as it happens. id go with the one from discovery channel.its also cheaper! i woudnt buy this again.
3,Please excuse my ignorant review.,"I wasn't very happy when I bought this, I expected more from MF Doom. Hoecakes was my only track on here... So I was very dissapointed. The beginnings of all songs were annoying, because they were extremly long...I know this review was short, but look at all my other reviews once I get them up.----------------^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^That was then, this is now.And this is a 4/5 album."
2,"He tried, goodbye underground hello mainstream!!!!!!!!!!!!!","That is exactly it. Doom tried. This is not classic. 2.5 stars. I was expecting hot fiyah on this album, but instead its just slightly lukewarm fiyah on here. Ho cakes is classic with another classic motown sample, Kon Queso was tight, and Track #10. That is about it. I like the joint with guest production by Madlib only because I saw Doom perform it live in 2003 @ Scribble Jam! Other than that, this is the verge of the mighty Doom falling off. The problem is that people are giving praise to the madvillian album, and Danger Doom. Truly I mean WTF???????? This is the bottom line. Doomsday was classic, MM.. Food is decent at best, and Doom as mighty wordsmith that he is, will only be good for cameo's like U-God, and Talib Kweli. Peace!!!!!!!!!!"
1,OMG LISTEN UP,i got mad respect for doom but theres not a lot of rap on this album and the beats are way of. sry doom. this album doesn deserve a 1 i just put that there so u ppl would look.
3,I didnt like it that much,"Vaudeville villian was better, so was madvillany. He was slow to think of his rhymes and the beats are not as refined as madlib's."
4,dont know about the special limited edition packaging,"good cd, arrived in good time. Didn't seem to have special packaging as described, but did come with a dvd."
5,OH MY GOD,"One of the most slept on producer/mc's in the game!!! The ""MCs sound like cheerleaders"" line is hilarious but true! But none better than the line in Beef Raps ""are you rhymers or stripping males? outta work jerks since they shut douwn chippendales!""this guys says what I'm thinking when I watch rap videos!!!How is he the only guy in Hip Hop that could blend jj fad and anita baker...and make it dope?!?This guy never ceases to amaze me on the boards. He is also one of the only people that can sample an obscure part of a Sade song and make a whole track from it.This guy is a throwback to the day that you had to be original to be considered dope. Doom sums it up best when he says 'few can do it and even fewer can sell it.'Classic DOOM."
2,balletteachers balletclass music,"Like the classical music in vol. 1 & 2 better, than these compositions, the old masters are the best for classical balletclasses."
5,A terrific tools,"This tool is ideal for installing garage doors, playground equiptment, shelving or any other installation with a lot of fasteners. The addition of a strap makes it even better. It's not cheap, but it will pay for itself (like all good tools) almost immediately."
1,This author is NOT a scholar of Buddhism,"It is abundantly clear from the author's writings that he is neither a serious scholar nor a sincere practitioner of Buddhism, and his books on the subject are therefore quite frankly a waste of time. He is prone to gross mischaracterizations and even denigrations of religious traditions and lineages, as well as to taking very narrow, unrefined and polemical positions. This is, of course, always the danger when someone expounds on a subject in which he is insufficiently versed or experienced."
3,"Jose Aruego, review",I thought it was great. It talks about his life and almost anything you want to know about him! I learned about him!
4,good stuff,"I must say i do like the peatbog's. i first heard them on a celtic music stream i have on my computer. they have beautifle instrumental's in the tradtional style of scottish celtic, but then theyll rock your socks, off w/ something you didnt even see coming... i would reccomend this CD to anyone who is a fan of celtic or who would like to get into celtic."
2,I received it dirty!,"I ordered this item using my friend's amazon account because that time I don't have an account here. When the item arrived, I've noticed that it has a lot of dust on it and it's dirty especially the plastic package that comes with it. It seems its not brand new as what it was advertised here. Also, the velco of this in the arms separated from each other after a few times of wearing while I'm checking its fit."
3,Good resource,"Interesting info and food for thought. Most kids end up right back on the street trying to survive. High school education is good, but these kids need greater survival skill to be on their own."
5,An adventure toshow off!,I enjoy the new format. Gives one the feeling of peering through the viewfinder yourself. The writing is thoughtful and never overtakes the photograph.
3,Watch out! These could be Ritek's!,"Be wary of Fuji's nowadays, since they seem to be made by Ritek, who makes really poor quality CDRs. You have to check the package to be sure that they are really Ritek's for sure. But I am pretty sure that at this cheap price, they have to be manufactured by Ritek. So stay away!"
3,not TY from Japan,"I received these discs quickly, but was disappointed to see that they are from Taiwan NOT Japan. Packaging is totally different than pictured (gold label not blue)but this could just be an update. The label says maximum performance and archival quality which is what I want for photos. I haven't used them yet so will submit another review of the quality later."
3,NOT THE TAIYO YUDEN VERSION!!,"These cds worked okay in my Plextor PX-716AL but I had about 4 coasters out of the batch. This may be because Acoustica MP3 CD Burner software is f-ing up all the time lately so I can't TOTALLY fault the discs but these are NOT the Taiyo Yuden versions. These ones are made in Taiwan, NOT Japan. If you want the REALLY good ones that never f up on you, make sure you get the Taiyo Yuden versions, not these. An average disc."
2,Poor Shipping Method,"Excellent CD-Rs, but the shipping was horrible. Packaging was too flimsy for the weight of the product, and as a result, the case was broken in half upon delivery. Contacted the seller, but never got a response. Will not purchase from them in the future."
3,"Fuji 25301475 CD-R, 80 Minute, 700 MB, 16X (50-Pack Spindle)",The cd was good but to long to me shipping and te shipping is to high... But the cd was good great but with a 6.17 dollar shipping was to high...
3,Overpriced,"I bought a bottle of high quality safflower oil at WalMart for half the price of this one.LouAna brand. 24oz for about $5.00, including sales tax."
4,Brings back some pleasant memories.,"I grew up huddled with these books on Sunday afternoons, and I feared Trixie wouldn't hold up to my adult sensibilities. How wrong! Sure it's quaint, dated and utopian. But the memories are sweet and comforting. This tale was always my favorite. Trixie and her friends dig into Civil War history, roam the countryside freely and live for friendship, adventure, good citizenship and mother's homecooking."
5,Life Recovery Bible,"This is the most efficient way to study scripture and the 12 steps together in an organized, rational straight forward way that allows you to plan each reading. It is concise, straight and has biblical backing for each step in an easy to read format that lends itself to use as a teachers aid. I have used this book for years in the recovery community and find it a indespensible tool."
5,mike,I have used this product and highly recommend it has a steel mesh core yet is very flexible and takes the heat.
5,Great Presentation of Both Sides of The Debate,"Dowling presents a complex subject in a very readable manner...the way our brain is influenced by our heredity and our environment.It is fascinating to read about the way our brain develops and adapts from infancy to old age.Really makes you realise that the brain is still malleable as we grow older, gives me the assurance that I will still be capable of acquiring new skills and knowledge after 60.Chemistry is not always the main cause of temperament, mental, psychological or relationship issues...so seeking relief with a psychiatrist's prescription (or using recreational drugs) may not always be the most optimum solution.Reminds me of Carl Sagan's clarity in ""Billions and Billions"" and ""Science a Candle in the Dark"".A great book for the well-informed amateur and for the amateur who seeks to be well-informed."
3,Hard to believe Pat would give his own album five stars!,I guess if Pat knew that he wasn't going to get any money he wouldn't have tried so hard!
5,Farce on tap,"Perhaps the greatest pop farce around. Patrick mixes irreverant topics, off color humor, and ""in your face"" shock to create a fusion of color, craziness, and rancor.One artist's way highlighting the hypocracy of American life. You'll laugh and cringe at the first listenning, but when you go back again, you'll probably get the message."
3,Still funny,"Quite shocking in the early 70's, most of still is. It makes me remember what a great decade of music was with all the singer/songwriters. Then Punk and disco came along and music died. The corpse continues to hang there but no-one will cut it down."
1,Songs that deserved to be forgotten,"It's hard to believe that we live in a world where one must pay $70 to find a CD copy of Phil Och's ""Greatest Hits,"" yet this album remains accessible at a reasonable price. Patrick Sky mentions that he didn't get any royalties from this, which is sad in some ways, but perhaps deservedly so in other ways, since upon hearing it, many will ask, ""Why did he bother?"" or ""Who needs this?"" or ""Can I have my money back?"" It wasn't too funny in the 70s, and hasn't aged particularly well. There are a few chuckles, to be sure, as Patrick Sky is too talented to let the listeners down completely, but, gee whiz, most of this is just plainly stinks. If you like Patrick Sky's folky stuff, get his other albums, which really are worthwhile and certainly deserve more than their cult status. But beware of this attempt at being the lefty-male folk world's ""Cheech n Chong."""
5,So much for little fingers to flip!,"I received a Lift-the-Flap book as a hand-me-down (it was one on ""sizes"" that focused on opposites in its format), and my 17-month-old son was choosing to read it every night. I ordered a few more Lift-the-Flaps, and I'm really pleased with the ABC book. I love the photographs of realia--as opposed to drawings--and appreciate that concepts are introduced in addition to the words and pictures. I also appreciate the authors' efforts to include things both familiar (yo-yo) and unfamiliar (yacht...at least, in the South) to toddlers, and there are plenty of objects included that are part of a toddler's world. This book is sure to increase my son's vocabulary, as it grabs his attention continually throughout the day."
5,excellent farm to ranch wear,"ease of changing shoes from outdoor to indoor use..water protection, excellent shoe.. excellent fit, durable product"
4,You may need a translator,"Beware, these cards have NO ENGLISH TRANSLATIONS on them. Most of the illustrations seem self explanitory; however, there are a few that are questionable. For instance, one figure seems to be running or skipping and all you have to work with is the word ""brincar."" Luckily, I have a live-in translator who tells me that the word means ""to hop."" On the other side of the card they use the word in a simple sentence (in the first person) ""Yo brinco en un pie;"" again, if you do not have a translator you'll need to look it up yourself to find out that the sentence means, ""I hop on one foot.""Personally, I think these cards are great, especially since I'm a visual learner. I'm willing to research online, and through my spanish dictionary, to find the english translations and then write it on the cards myself."
4,a wise and clear introduction to meditation,"I've been meditating in the Vipassana tradition for almost four years, and picked this up after reading the wonderful book ""Buddhism Without Beliefs"" by Martine's husband Stephen Batchelor. I was not disappointed.This book is a plain-spoken, humble, wise, good-natured, and non-tendential introduction to a variety of buddhist spiritual outlooks and practices, with particular attention to Vipassana (insight meditation) and Korean Zen methods. I strongly recommend it both to novice meditators and more experienced practitioners. Each will find an ample store of insight, example, and inspiration for continued practice within its pages.Stephen Batchelor's luminous formalist photography of the everyday nicely complements the unadorned truths of the writing, though the overstylized graphic design undermines the impact of the images."
4,Great resource for beginners,"I've always been fascinated with meditation and I had wanted to try it for a long time. However, as an atheist, other books on meditation frustrated me with their religions messages. I found no such problem with this book. Martine Batchelor offers an excellent guide to meditation that will lead to self-understanding and peacefulness without all the religious shenanigans."
2,Unsatisfying on many fronts,"We have now removed this shower head and its specialized shower arm and its specialized escutcheon and the short water-supply extension pipe these require and replaced them with a better and less costly set of components. The driving problem with the 18494 is that its conventional spray pattern is fine and broad; it stings tender flesh and does not deliver enough water to any one spot to easily remove soap or shampoo. Then, there is the matter of its over-sized couplings (head to arm, arm to water supply) making piecemeal substitutions impossible. Finally, the head's inner workings are plastic, so they break easily when one takes it apart for cleaning/descaling. And, did I mention, the package is costly. We switched to the 15966 ""Flip-Side"" and mounted it on a less-prestigious and normally-sized shower arm -- and we are much happier."
2,Riserblock alinment,I installed the riser block and the guides didn't lineup. The top guides were over a half inch forward of the bottom guides. I called tech help they informed me that this is an on going problem. They told me to remove the pins from the saw body. They said the pins are for alinment porposes only. They have nothing to do with holding it all in place. I am concrned this won't stop the top half of the saw twisting while under blade presure. They assured me it wouldn't be a problem. Let's hope it isn't a problem.
1,Real piece of junk!,"I got this iron @$20, thinking great deal! It's NOT! Cord is way to heavy! Cant sit it upright while ironing. Spit water half the time, which causes water spots. Then after about 4 months just wouldnt work at all. Ended up just having to throw it out."
3,"Great while it worked, but died pretty fast",I used this for less than a year before it totally died.It was great when it was working though.The unit will no longer turn on.That's pretty disappointing.
2,Nope,"If you can open the cap and refill the tank while the iron is still on then its just a water ""reservoir"" tank and NOT a pressurized steam generator (like the higher end Rowentas). This is why it tends to spurt water after hitting the button a few times..the iron is not able to convert the water to steam fast enough. If you want steady, consistant steam delivery, than consider an iron with a pressurized tank."
2,not so 'hot',"got the iron last week. It doesn't produce hot steam, rather a mist of cold water. The cold water is sprayed on the garment which it then heated with the iron. So this product can be used to iron, but not to steam a standing garment."
5,"Strong Woman, Strong Bones",This book was recommended by my 2 daughters who both have osteoporosis and are in their 30s. It covers everything and is easy to read and understand. Truly a handbook for anyone who has osteoporosis.
2,"Too fast, too harsh.","Although celebrated by some reviewers, I think Backhaus' box set doesn't excite the listener. Several movements are played too fast as if he had no patience or time to play (or record) them at the correct tempo marking.As far as recording is concern, there are differences among the sessions like mics placement and reverb. On the majority of the tracks, unfortunately, the piano sounds like an old and harsh fifth rate instrument.If you still doesn't know the Beethoven sonatas, I suggest starting from the Arrau's box set; if you're an expert and are looking for another version, check the amazing Anton Kuerti's recordings."
2,Amazon's Backhaus collection is Pathetic!!,"As a proud vinyl record collector, I find the Backhaus selection here on Amazon very lean indeed. I think it outrageous that his earlier UK Decca/London mono cycle is nowhere to be found. Some of the very first recording from 50-51 are a bit rough, but from 52 on the recordings are beautiful. PLEASE don't tell me that the mono/stereo debate is still going on in the 21st century! I, for one, have his complete stereo and mono cycles on vinyl and I think I'm the better for it. I've been hunting about for his LVB PCs with Krauss in glorious mono........I'm not going to kind it am I????? It's a pity."
3,Its not too bad a pen,"For the price, and quality i have experienced of Cross Pens, i was expecting a little more i guess.A similar Parker or Waterman at this price is much higher in quality."
5,Excellent,"Excellent Pen. Fresh Refills as opposed to Office Depot, where you might end with stale ones.Question: Basalt refers to volcanic rock. Is this pen really made out of Basalt? Not sure..Excellent Purchase!"
1,Cross ATX Ballpoint Pen,Terrible pen - I think it is counterfeit since it doesn't appear to be of the same cross quality I am used to. When I twist the barrel to lower the ballpoint it grinds - fit and finish is terrible. I am returning the pen to Amazon and will look into how to determine Chinese counterfeit Cross Pens before I buy in the future.
4,Great Pen,"I am used to writing with a bit thinner pen, but after using for a couple of weeks, I have gotten used to the feel with no problem. It writes very well, and I have gotten some nice compliments. Just ordered some fine point refills."
5,My son loves it,I purchased this as a gift for my son and he let me know how easily it is to write with and how he feels it's style makes a good impression on clients during meetings.
5,laser beam to reality,"after i ordered this set i promptly received an email from the shippers with the details. i ordered a second item from amazon at the same time as this, and this shipment arrived only about a week later than the item shipped by amazon.the cd's are amazing. the words that are expressed resonate deeply in my heart. these messages are like a laser beam into reality. it's like getting a behind-the-scenes tour of life. if you're into hearing truth without too many new age bells and whistles, this set is for you."
3,If this isn't an academic debate... what is?,"This is one of those books that is of interest only to a small, small percentage of people who are not just trying to USE rational choice for an end, but fairly interested in it as an intellectual device. As the review above indicates, it is a rejoinder to Green and Shapiro's work, and a capable one at that. ...As one might imagine, this is not a book for pleasure reading so much as a group of scholars commenting on the minutia of an argument that only affected .01% of the US population. For more general reading on public choice, check out Muller's Public Choice II or Perspectives on Public Choice."
5,keep that disco ball spinning!,"If you're looking for serious dance music,look no further!this sound track has what you're into.from the first to the last song you'll dance until you bring in the morning!This is a must for all dance/disco lovers!"
2,"A few good tracks, too few.","Studio 54 is a shabby film. I've spent $7 to watch it and a friend of mine spent an extra $20 to buy the soundtrack. After I've listened to the album I felt sorry for my friend and his 20 bucks. Like the film the Album is mostly full of chaff, with only two or three tracks worth listening to. The great ""heart of glass"" is the reason why this album got two stars instead of no stars at all, ""knock on wood"" is also nice, and so is the first track. So take your hard earned $20 and buy a ""Blondie"". With the change you can go and get a ticket to a good film."
1,....,"Bubblegum disco , bubblegum cheesy songs.Avoid it , try Salsoul , Philadelphia Int. etc, if you want to listen to the ""real stuff"" ."
2,what a waste!,"There aren't many good songs on this album. It's really lousy. ""Que sera di vida"" is good and the mix is pretty cool, but nothing else is worth listening to. And the worst part is that the best song of the movie (""If you could read my mind"") is on the second cd, not this one. I also would have liked full length versions of some of the songs in the mix."
2,Doesn't contain any big name 70s hits...Very Disappointing,"If you want a ""Best of 70s"" CD...this is not it. I'm a big disco fan and was expecting this to be ""THE"" CD to have...an instant 70s party, but it's not!!! A few good songs like ""Knock on Wood"" but no Gloria Gaynor,no We Are Family, no big names...NO GOOD! Also avoid the 2nd volume--it's no good as well!"
4,The Start,"This is the first book in a 4 novel series, and also the first published novel of Mr. Watt-Evans. The book is well written, and shows all the promise and excitement of a new and talented writer. The story has many familiar trappings as Garth is sent out on the first of many quests. Though the use of Garth the Overman as the main character makes for an interesting and differant read. I would recommend this book and series. If you enjoy the wryness of the story, check out The Misenchanted Sword for some fun."
5,It does it all.,"After seeing a good review for this item in a magazine. I figured what the heck. I needed a dock, (Apple as always way over the top in price) and I wanted a compact system to listen to my ipod on a desk top. The Speaker Dock 2 far exceeded my expectations. Its a dock for charging, its a stand for watching videos, and for its size has unbelievable sound. Its no Bose system, but it delivers a great sound at a very reasonable price.I still give it 5 stars even though I have one improvement suggestion. Rechargeable, that would have really put the icing on the cake. But the ""Sony BCG-34HRMD4 Super Quick Charger with LCD Indicator and 4 AA Batteries Makes this a perfect setup."
4,Quality easel at great price!,"Great easel. It's simple but sturdy. No assembly required and easy to adjust for different size canvases. I didn't want to spend a lot on a easel since I'm a newbie to painting, but I got a lot more than I expected! Great purchase."
3,You get what you pay for,"This is a nice looking easel. It can be adjusted in height, which is nice and it can tilt. Overall it feels good and looks good for the price paid. The only problem I have with this easel is that the center point connection of all three legs and the canvas holder is a little bit tricky. There is one bolt you can tighten to secure it all at once but looking at the material I was afraid to tighten it up. It took a while to get it right."
4,Good easel,"I like this Easel. Pretty good, relatively good sturdiness. I work with oil pastels and there is some pressure that I apply to the canvas while blending and this easel hold fine to that."
4,"Functional, portable easel for beginners","I bought this as I was beginning with acrylic and watercolor paints. Being able to completely adjust height and angle on the legs and top is a MUST as I sit in different chairs and stools depending on the location.This easel can be a bit tricky to put away, but for the price and convenience I would still recommend it."
2,Use to be great stuff,"I use to always buy the Capuccino Ice then stopped for about 6 months. When I purchased it again, it was renamed Capuccino and the recipe changed (looks like no caffeine). It now tastes just as bad as the rest of the protein shakes on the market. What happened? It use to taste great!!Get on the ball EAS and go back to the old recipe!!!"
4,Death of Innocence: The Story of the Hate Crime...,"I have only read the forward and the frist few chapters of this publication. It is amazing how a mother accepts her child's death and continue to live life to the fullest, but that is life. I was amazed to see that this publication had been written on such tragic event, but Emmett Till's mother writes this book in memory of her child, about her life, their family life and the evils of our nation. I am sure this publication served as healing vehicle for her because he died as a child, which means he never reached maturity to graduate from high school, enjoy/experience life or just to play as a child like kids do everday in this country. It is a great and sad story, that other human beings (adults) can hurt and killed a child because according to them, he violated the rights of a caucasian female."
5,A good Book,"As a mother myself,I cannot fathom how a young black child could be so horribly and viciously killed. For years, there have been different versions to this story,and for the most part,it made him seem as though he was disrespectful to the lady when all that only happened was this young fella trying to get what he wanted out of his mouth by whistling(as he was taught by his mother and grandmother).Thank God for Mrs Mobley's book. I read it through within a day. Some of the stuff,I had to make myself read,and it makes you wonder how folk can still go on living after such an ordeal. My hat goes out to the memory of a dear woman who lived her life with courage and dignity,and a son needlessly killed. Every mother regardless of her color should read this book."
1,Needs a better description,"I decided to purchase this for my husband for Christmas. What I didn't know is that there are 2 different sized Xbox 360s! He opened it up and really liked it, until we realized that it was not the right size. I don't regularly play video games, so there is no way I would have known that it comes in 2 different sizes. No where in the description does it say this! I am very disappointed!"
5,Clean Wood Grain,Easy to put on and makes your XBOX unique. Looks best if in between 2 other devices or next to something as it doesn't match the white XBOX body.
3,Second hand is second hand,"Had a small yet deep 1/8th inch scratch on one edge (black marker fixed) and the spring for the front USB lid was completely busted (had to replace with spring from old face plate), and it clearly was labeled as ""used, but in like-new condition."" ... But, I'm just happy with it because it looks so darn cool on my black 360 case with the blue LEDs on the back fan. Besides those two things, I was very happy."
3,Saw it at the 99 cents store,I saw this and the carbon fiber looking face plate at the 99 cents store a few months back. Just wanted to let people know to check there first if you have one nearby
5,Great quality,This is a great product. I could not be happier with the quality and the price greatest deal around. Makes my 360 look original and mean looking.
5,Awesome,This Halo faceplate is very easy to install and looks really cool. I highly recommend buying this to impress your friends.
5,Good deal!!!,"These face plates are nearly impossible to find in any store right now. They really do kind of change up the appearance of your xbox. They are also great for just replacing a damaged or scratched face plate. I purchased two of these in the Amazon marketplace from the vendor ""katqueen."" Both of my items arrived within 3 days and were brand new as described for incredibly reasonable rates. If you need a new face plate, order from katqueen."
4,"Nice, clean design","I replaced my original white faceplate with a Viva Pinata one. It was great for a while but was rather busy to look at. The Forza 2 faceplate is a lot more clean and modern. Not much lets you know it's a Forza 2 faceplate besides the text across the USB port cover. The rest of the faceplate is just geometric design.The only thing that kept this faceplate from getting a 5 was the actual execution of the graphics. The carbon fiber looks okay small in the photo on the site, but when you see it in person looks rather poorly done. Also, the white on the face plate is whiter than the white of the Xbox 360 so it doesn't match very well."
1,not what it seems,It was more of transcripts from a diary and how this man sought out this other man his whole life. Creepy. Not educational in the least. Too much information about the stalkings of these two men and the weird relationship they had.
2,Won't Hold Charge,"I ordered two of these through Amazon, one after the other for two phones my wife and I have. The first one worked as expected but the second one would not hold a charge. It (the 2nd one) is completely useless. So watch out if you order."
5,Touches the heart,"The energy, melancholy, earthiness, spirituality, and rhythmic drive of Andean folk music are well represented in this collection. I have owned the tape for over 25 years and was delighted to see that Amazon carried the CD.I was fortunate enough to have attended several performances of Tahuantinsuyo many years ago. Their approach is fresh, enthusiastic, and heart-felt. If you enjoy the music of the Andes, I highly recommend this CD."
2,Just Ok,"First south american music CD I've bought. I was looking for a CD with good pan flute and interesting relatively quick beats. Track 1 is definitely better than the others. Search continues for music like Track 1 on this CD. This CD is relatively short, seems like about 35 minutes or less."
4,Romance,Music to feel the sound of the words. Italians singers allways put a lot of feelings on their music.
1,Almost insightless,"Once you skim the flying blither, there is little other than clumsy narratives about people who have gotten their share of the pie moving out to expropriate the communities of those who have made do with less to build. Karlgaard seems to assume that relocating means one can immediately participate in social structures built painstakingly one year at a time. The author offers no suggestions about how to make a community better by being part of it, only shopping advice for those who are location ""consumers"". Perhaps ""home"" is now a commodity to be researched and purchased, but it will not be a place for the heart ot reside."
2,Don't Bother,"Frankly, I'm not impressed with this book. The reviews looked really good, but in my opinion it doesn't live up to its promise.The concept of a guy flying around the US and meeting people sounded great, but the flying descriptions are lackluster as are the descriptions of characters met. Most of the latter appear to be old chums the author is looking up. To be fair, I'm only about halfway through the book, but the characters all sound the same, and no one the average Joe could relate to. It looks like the back part of the book has a breakdown of towns/areas and rates their quality of life.Instead of this book, I'd recommend buying an old copy of Richard Bach's ""Barnstorm"" and one of those annual paperback versions Places Rated"
5,Hits the Nail on the Head,"The Author HITS THE NAIL ON THE HEAD with his fun, inciteful journey around America. There is more to life than NY and California, and Mr. Karlgaard tells a tale that could give many the courage and conviction to follow their instincts and find happiness in their roots. A good fast read that makes one think of the options that lie ahead, for an improved quality of life and working environment. I just bought a few more copies for friends in need. Cheers Rich."
4,"A fun read, and a good one too.","I liked the book. The vignettes are a fun and easy read. Some of the reviewers did not care for his writing about the details of his flying the plane; I am not a pilot, but did enjoy that aspect of the narrative. The stories get a little repetitive...ie. leaving the expense and hassle of big city life for a more afforable and better quality of living in a smaller city. However it was interesting to read the details of the various places. I am wondering if others noted how unhealthy sounding the food is that the author was consuming at the various places. I will give this book 4 stars as I found it fun to read and the theme driven home nicely."
2,A good book that needs revisions,"This is a great book, but it is completely out of date. The ""up and coming"" communities noted in the book are based on old standards (pre-recession). Lots of neat information, I just wish it was relevant to today. A fun read, but don't expect any good ideas."
4,One of the best classical guitarists today.,I bought this CD at a David Russel performance because he was such a great performer. I like the CD as much as I liked his live performance. He has expressive sound and makes the guitar sing and ring (sic).
5,The Osama bin Laden I Know: An Oral History of al Qaeda's Leader,"I enjoyed the contents of this book, it is very informative. Peter Bergen gets into deep detail regarding O. Bin Laden's past and whereabouts before 9/11. However, sometimes I felt it had too much detail that didn't really had to be included in the book. One thing is for sure, Peter Bergen is the journalist to ask about O. Bin Laden. He has credibility."
3,A Rather Unsatisfactory Bio of Bin Laden,"Peter Bergen is a journalist well known for his knowledge of Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda. Here he presents an ""oral"" history by piecing together documents and interviews into what he considers a narrative whole. For the most part there is nothing new here that hasn't already been out in the public domain. And there is very little analysis. It is basically a group of documents strung together with commentary from Bergen.For me, this style just doesn't work. It's not a very pleasant reading experience. And while the narrative hangs together well - Bergen would have been better off to write a narrative history of bin Laden with deeper analysis. That would have taken a bit more time and work to complete, but it would have served the reader much better."
5,Great Read,"Fascinating book packed with primary sources and interviews. Despite being written in 2006, it still upholds well with only a coupe exceptions. Overall the book is highly readable and informative."
4,The Osama Bi Laden I Know,This is a very detailed account of Osama Bin Laden's geographical movements and support he continues to receive from around the globe.
4,A summary of testimonies,"Peter Bergen is one of the few western journalists to have interviewed Osama Bin laden in person, and as such, can offer insight into this man that few others can. This book is a portrait of bin Laden as created from the accounts of numerous individuals who have met the man. These include family friends, family members, former bodyguards, work colleagues, childhood friends, journalists, politicians, and businessmen. The book chronicles bin Laden's life and ""career"" in terrorism chronologically, using the words and reflections of those who knew him, instead of relaying Mr. Bergen's personal opinion. What comes across is a man of focus and perseverance; one who gladly sacrifices his own safety and luxury as a way of inspiring his followers to do more. The book is fairly easy reading, with a fair amount of explanation of names, places and events by the author to give a good history of Al Qaeda."
4,A Good Oral History,"As a person who has long tried to understand how this person could be a part of the horrible things he did, this book is very revealing. Through the use of first-hand accounts from people who interacted with bin Laden at different phases of his life, the reader sees how a person very strict muslim views are radicalized to the point where killing innocent people becomes a real option. Mr. Bergen's work is pretty rigorous and he's to be commended for it.I purchased the audio version of this book and I thought he did a good job, although I could have done without some of the inflection he used to differentiate between Bergen's words and the first-hand experiences of those interviewed."
3,A little to repetative,I love his music but I don't think that most people will like all of this.The title cut is great but after that it is all the same.I know that was his idea to show different aspects to the same song but got a little boring after awhile. I would have still baught this CD because I love his sound.
3,Sax sex,Credit due for carving out a unique niche- if Barry White played saxophone it'd surely sound like this- but the material is stretched thin for an album.
2,a 10 and 12 year old band?? ummm....,"well some songs are ok but mostly im thinking ""hello, wait 10 years!"" i think its nice that preteen girls are singing, tho, and kudos to Chloe and Asya for that. i couldn't really hear Asya's voice in the CD, i think its fine tho, but not American Idol quality. I think that when SMOOSH is all grown up they'll be AWESOME, but right now they need some more work. some songs are catchy, others...well...rapping? not for you! but this was around a 5 out of 10 I'd say. good job, SMOOSh, for giving it a try!"
2,I can pass,"I could pass for this CD, for their pitch sometimes is a little off, and the drums sometimes take power over the voice of the band. The lyrics seem to be pretty good, but I tell you, listen to the samples of their songs before purchasing their CD. Most bands could do better...Let's take their age into consideration. The drummer girl is pretty good at drumming for a 10 year old, and the singer is alright for a 13 year old, except I have a friend who recently turned 10, (young, right?), and SHE sings better than SMOOSH. Instead of listening to the singing, how about making a CD with only the drum music on it, and not the terrible squealing that people consider singing. Please, take what I'm telling you here into consideration, and just listen to the downloads and don't purchase this CD."
5,I'm In Love,"I am 50 yrs. old -- just to tell you this is not ""teeny-bop"", or only for pre-teens, or something ridiculous like that. I first read about Smoosh about 2 weeks ago in a Spin magazine. I am entranced with She Like Electric. Every word of the reviews above are true, true, true. I listen to this CD every day, at least twice. Really! The energy, variety, the voices, the rhythm, the drums, the singing, the lyrics. A PERFECT cd. Not like so many releases with 3 songs you really like, and the rest dross. I haven't been thrilled with an entire CD, without exception, for years. I listen to a LOT of music, of all kinds, including plenty of new stuff, and this is something authentic, remarkable, and new. I CANNOT wait for their next release. Don't deprive yourself of this experience/event. It's not like anything else."
1,Well...,I don't know. They tried...but failed. 'Bottlenose' was just...it actually reminded me of the music they put on those Anime shows. It was crazy...really...the rapping is cheesy...what else? I have to give 'em props for the music they actually play. They are good at that. But otherwise...I just don't know what to say.
2,Incredible talent that's still developing...,"I have listened to this band only during their interview with Nic Harcourt on KCRW's Morning Becomes Eclectic. I just think that it's awesome that some kids with potential and some success don't have huge egos and are still pretty wholesome. I don't think it's appropriate to compare their music to the other indie rock bands out there, being that they're 12 or 13 and they don't have any pedigree or training. The interview says it all. They're just starting out. I look forward to their music five years from now when they've had more experience."
3,Me like electric too!,"Very impressive. I like this album bc it is different, original, and not pretentious in any way. There are some very good, catchy cuts which makes this album fun to listen to. THere is alot of potetial for these girls to become amazing and I personally like hopping on the bandwagon now so that I can experience the way they mature as musicians and songs writers as they do it in real time. I can see how the novelty for some might wear thin very quickly, not ALOt of diversity YET in the song writing and melody lines, but some very good songs that have that magic that makes it a song that you never skip when you hear it like ""La Pump"". not great (yet), but good none the less. BUY IT!! its SO worth it."
1,I would like to give them credit but I can't,Face it this album sucks. I mean you dont know a word they are saying and screaming their heads off in bottlenose. All songs they are way off pitch. I mean they probably had one professional music lesson which didn't help at all. They are probably like since my family has sooo much money we can record an album just to be cool. This is a disgrace to all 13/14 year olds. Look at like all the other singers out there. They probably only recorded the song once and didnt practice at ALL. I mean they should have at least another year of voice lessons maybe it would be fine but Smoosh please save our ears and wait until you actually can sing.
2,Why did they make this cd?,"I heard about smoosh in a magazine, so I decided to listen to their songs on Amazon.com. Aysa and Chloe are pretty much average singers, they might get better in a few years. They probably made this cd because they bet someone that they would. I personally wouldn't buy this cd and I don't think my friends would."
1,Did people really give this crap five stars?,"I remember a time not too long ago when a girl won the McDonalds highschool dunk competition by ""covering her eyes so she couldn't see the basket"" as she dunked. Of course she could probably see the whole time she was going up for the dunk and she even uncovered her eyes as she dunked the ball. Of course, she won because... i dont know. maybe people were shocked that a girl could actually dunk the ball or maybe they thought that she did something that nobody in that dunk competition could top. Oddly enough, listening to this cd and then reading the reviews made me think of that dunk competition. This music is terrible and if you listen to this garbage then you are terrible too. Death cab for cutie as awesome but a horrible ten year old girl singing good music does not make the music good. People feel bad to write bad reviews but they shouldn't... this music is just plain bad."
1,Smoosh ruined my life!,"I heard ""rad"" and ""bottlenose"" and I immediately fainted. It was so bad!!! These people sound like 4 year olds screaming at the top of their lungs. I would really like to give this CD -5 stars and so would everyone with good taste. Do not make the same mistake I made; listening to a free demo.Sincerely,Me"
2,umm... cornfused (?),"ok.. im a thirteen year old girl... and i cant decide if this is really really weird or just plain bad. while it is amazing that these girls are now 13 and 11, they arent exceedingly talented. and what is up with some of their songs? its like a three year old rapping about soccer. and bottlenose? its sounds like someone is torturing a bunch of mice. decide for yourself, because i cant."
4,Lzzie thinks this album rocks!!!!,"I read about these two girls in ""american Girl"" magazine. I went online, heard these preteens, and I LOVE it. One of the reasons I really like it is because these girls are my age and they are so ambitious and they really are trying to do good music. Which, of course, they are. The music has a certain edge to it and is not pop at all. I HATE POP. If their music was pop, i would hate this album. But it's a smaller, more preteen-ish feel of rock. Well, I really do love Asya's and Chloe's music. They will even get better if they grow up with their music. So, if you two are reading this now, KEEP IT UP!!!!!!!--Lizzie A."
5,Wow!,"Oh my god! When I saw this CD on the internet and listened to massive cure, i thought this band was a junior wannabee band. but when i listened to Rad, It's cold and La pump, i knew i would love the whole CD. i got it for my bday (november 2nd) and its been in my boom box ever since.Let me give a little advice;1)before buying the CD go here: [...]it's a music video of Rad2) listen to some of the clipssmoosh rocks! I really don't understand why people say that ""it's a disgrace for 13/14 year olds"". Chole and Asya are great role models for kids and even adults! Get the CD. Believe me, it's worth it."
2,Okay.....,"this was a little weird. espcially bottlenose and the quack. what the heck was with that?? there are only a few songs worth listening to, but otherwise the album is a waste of money. the only thing i like about it was that it was different from all the music i like to listen to."
2,er,"very very talented girls...that need to wait.this album was produced, er, prematurely?Their voices and the music need a lot of work. They are extremely talented for their age, and I can forsee that they will be horribly successful in the future, but this album was just not released at the right time. Someday when they grow up, these girls will look back and listen to what they did, and say ""oh my god.. i didn't do this. why couldn't i wait till i was ready?""this album just doesn't have a specific audience. Should all the preteens listen to this? or could it be possibly aimed at an older audience? that would be ironic, though, as the lyrics and music are shallow and not well written from an adult or older person's point of view. Yet knowing their ages, this truly is a piece of art.. which they should save for their own home.let's get to the real thing when we're ready."
1,Make sure you want it!,I tried to buy 1 episode and got the whole season for near 30 dollars. If you figure out how to get money back let me know!
3,Ending of a Good Cartoon,"The show by season 4 was already in its last stages, with some changes already in place.Inspector Gadget niece was not the original voice. But its still funny cartoon."
1,Save your money,"It simply doesn't work, the stitch will not stay in, it pulls right back out. I, and others who have tried to get it to work, finally gave up. The directions are no help. Don't buy, it is junk. I have one you can have free, just come and get it."
1,"I wish I could say ""0 stars""... 1 star is too high a rating","The handy-stitch is completely useless.I just realised that, on the info-mercial, they never actually show the bottom of what they are sewing... basically, it's just a bunch of loops with no thread to anchor it in, so the stitching pulls right back out. What a waste of money! I wish I could give it zero stars... one star is way too high a rating for this."
1,Wish it could be a negative 5 star rating,"Just to echo the other comments, don't waste your time with this piece of junk. Spend the extra money on a real sewing machine. I was unable to produce even ONE stitch. If it managed to penetrate the material I was attempting to sew, the stitch would promptly fall apart before I could even get to manually tie it off. I feel ripped off, and I even got it as a gift!"
1,Horrible Junk,If I could give it a zero I would. I got this product as a gift and it never worked out of the box. All it did was jam. I wasted alot of time trying to get the thing to work. Trust me don't waste yours.
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,This little gadget did not work for me at all. One of the needles broke the first time I used it and the stitches do not stay in place IF you manage to make a stitch. I threw the junk away after it collected dust for a year.
1,Waste of time and money,"My husband bought me mine for Christmas. I was never able to sew anything with it - the stitches were uneven and wouldn't even stay together. My husband was disappointed because it was wasted money (we live in Bermuda - he bought it in a local craft shop - and it cost almost double the US price). It's better to buy a real sewing machine, or even a children's version!"
1,worthless piece of junk...,"...wonderful example of ""you get what you pay for."" This pathetically underpowered joke can barely sew anything more than one micrometer thick...unfortunately the ""As Seen On TV"" shop where I bought mine doesn't do refunds, so I had to take store credit. At least Amazon gives you a full refund, you'll just have to pay return shipping."
1,Complete garbage,"First of all the it was broken in the box when i got it. A dial was broken off, and a plastic plate was snapped in half. I figured, ok, ill just super glue it back on, and it will be fine. That worked. Now when I go to sew something the needle breaks within five minutes. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM, IT IS COMPLETE GARBAGE."
3,Not the original!,"This is not the film as originally produced by George!! None of the original Elvis music is included which is actually what added to the absurdity of all this, just not the same without ""Blue Christmas"" playing in the background. I was so excited to get it and was going to give as a valentine present to my grown children, watching the original has been a family holiday tradition since it was first distributed. I, and friends are actually in the film! The actual footage seen here is as it always has been, just not the music. This is in the families opinion, of course!! A line all you viewers will understand."
3,Nice mower but it shipped and arrived damaged!,"I ordered this mower through Amazon and when it arrived, the shipping box was intact with no visible damage whatsoever. I unloaded it and poured in the included oil. I fired her up and she began spitting out oil everywhere. I bent down to check the engine and low and behold there was a large 3"" gash in my engine! It was huge! UPS left it, so I can't refuse shipment, (aside from the fact I already put oil and gas into it), amazon won't take it back, and the local MTD authorized repair shop won't fix this under warranty because they say it looks like shipping damage! Now what?I did order a YardMan Snowblower last year and had absolutely NO trouble with it whatsoever and am very happy with it. I am not sure I will ever order another item such as this online, especially from amazon as it is too much trouble to deal with in case something is wrong."
4,starts great!,I am thrilled with how easily this mower starts (one pull). We had to get rid of our Sears model because it was too difficult to start. The only disappointment is that is does not roll backward very easily (which can make it hard to manuver in tight spaces) and my husband thought the plastic felt a little cheap. Other than that we are thrilled with the job it does.
4,Sturdy and reliable,"While this mower will not ""cut any thing you can push it into"" as another reviewer said, it does do a very good job at a very good price. It starts easily and I can use it without asking my husband to prep it or prestart it to warm it up before I take it off to the Nevada outback to do a little cutting. I can't use it on rough terrain and it chokes on some of the big nasty weeds that grow around the edges of my garden beds but even a gas string trimmer has some difficulty with those. I like the clean lines and the simple operation of this mower. It isn't as noisy as our old one and the mulching feature is nice enough that we use this tool once in a while on the lawn instead of the riding mower (which doesn't mulch) Overall, based on price and features, I would recommend this mower over all the others offered in the same price range at the time we purchased it."
5,No Hassles - No Worries,"It arrived in just a couple days, very simple to put together. Started up immediately and works great. Bagger is easy to use and has provided hours of lawnmowing fun already."
4,YardMan Push Mower,Does what I wanted it to. Seems to be a good little machine. Now we'll just wait and see how long she lasts.
4,A Forgotten Thrash Metal Classic,"I had this cd for a while in the 90's but i hadn't the time to care about the music. I sold it but now I have bought it again. Nuclear Assault has always delivered well-crafted thrash metal with thought-provoking lyrics and this is no exception. The instrumental ""Save the planet"" is the peak of the album. Even the Sweet-cover ""Ballroom blitz"" is quite a piece of work."
2,fact of fiction?,"I realize Mr. Marion says this book is a mixture of fact and fiction, but the amalgamation of both coupled with this writing style, essentially render the whole effort fiction and comic-book fantasy reading. As such, if you read it for entertainment purposes only, it has engaging sections. Yet many sections completely bore you or make you feel Mr. Marin is simply boasting about his supposed prowess and intellectual escapades (not to mention his sexual escapades). In short, after the roller-coaster ride through Tokyo's Chuo-Ku, it leaves you somewhat cheapened, like a one night stand by the author and Wall-Street's biggest. I suppose that was the intent based on the title, but you never realize how bad that can be till the ""morning after."""
3,Is this true?,"I couldn't tell if this book was supposed to be true. Is Lehman Brothers really such a crooked place? I work in financial services so of course I have heard of Lehman Brothers. I thought that was a good company. This book makes them sound like a cross between Enron and the Japanese Yakuza. The writer has a very unusual style, but it is pretty easy to read. Any body who works with Lehman Brothers should probably read this book!"
4,.She writes much like her music,"I have always loved Helen's music - more for the B side of her 45's then the A side. What I mean to say is that Helen's voice and musical talent often shined on those little tracks that didn't get airplay or didn't get on the charts. Her unique voice lended itself much better to her offbeat jazzy and bluesy material (such as ""Ladychain"") then the more saccarine ""No way to Treat a Lady"".Much like her song selections, Helen holds back a little too much in this book. It's the little tidbits of info that shined in the book. I really liked details that she often glosses over. I felt that in Helen's career she was too cautious - too cautious to ""get down""(which she totally has the talent to do), and too cautious to get to far off the Adult Contemporary style which I never felt really fit her more indepenedent and unique style. Likewise, here book is the same. She keeps to things that would sale. Still a good book anyway."
3,Hear her Roar,"Being a Helen Reddy fan since the age of seven, it was with great interest to read her Memoir at age forty. I was somewhat disappointed though as she spends a great deal talking about her family and tracing back to her roots and meeting with family members who knew family members she did not get to know. This revealed one thing about me. I was no longer a Helen Reddy fan, just a fan of her music. She does kind of slide through her career and how husband number two took advantage of her and embezzled most of her money behind her back. Overall, It's not a bad back. It just was not what I expected, but I feel I know the lady better now."
2,Reddy for More,"I've been a Helen Reddy fan for over 30 years and was excited to hear about an autobiography about her life. But like the some of her records, I was disappointed in the lack-luster spirit by which she chose to write. No detail, no specifics; nothing that spoke of a woman that keep me following her career for so many years. Come on Helen, after 30 years I was hoping for more. The People Magazine article in 1982 gave more details about your life than this book! While this book was a welcome addition to my admiration of a long career, for a true Reddy fan such as myself, I wanted more! This is no way to treat a fan!By the way, Helen is exceptional in concert; fun, interactive, energenic, enthusiastic, and emotional. She's also this way in person and during interviews. Unfortunately, this book left me wanting to know why someone with such talent, such passion, would leave people asking what's the point.I'm always Reddy for more Helen though!"
5,Reddy or Not-Hear Her Roar!,"Helen Reddy's bio is beautiful, honest and deeply spiritual. From a woman of great inner power and valor comes not only a wonderful singing voice, but a voice and mind that inspires in the pages of The Woman I Am. There is a great reward here for fans and those just hearing Helen roar for the first time.Congrats Miss Reddy!Darrin Owens"
2,None,havent read the book frightened off by the ridiculous price kindle is asking. i do agree with tommywood that helen is not a nice person. my assessment of her is from when i tried to interview for australian radio. it took place in vegas when she was at the top of her recording career. she spat out a few answers and then walked out to find her ear rings that she had lost. she had agreed to the interview and i had flown in to do it. it wasnt a good experience.terry hughes
3,Mediocre autobiography,"I guess I expected more from a name that loomed so large during the years I was growing up in the 1970s. I admire Helen for standing by her principles and for her spiritual beliefs (though they're different than my own). But this memoir had a lot of chronological holes, a lot of new-age philosophy and when it does muster some force, it stops short of really landing a punch. (Three husbands referred to as NUMBERS? C'mon!) A much better example of a recent celebrity memoir is Teri Garr's autobiography."
5,A superbly presented primer to help beginners,"Kickboxing For Women by Jennifer Lawler (2nd Degree Black Belt, Tae Kwon Do) and Debz Buller (Certified Cardio-Karate, ACE Aerobics Instructor and ISSA Certified Personal Trainer) is a high-spirited, practical guide to stretching, exercise, fitness, and self-defense, written in direct, plain text and illustrated with plenty of demonstrative black-and-white photographs. While not a substitute for kickboxing classes taught by a professional, Kickboxing For Women is a superbly presented primer to help beginners with an interest better understand the basics of training and sparring. With workout plans written to take a woman's body and endurance into account, Kickboxing For Women is a winning supplement to any female kickboxer's physical fitness regimen!"
3,bunny,"The product works great at preventing hairballs, but it is not easy to give the medince to the rabbit. The package says put the product on ur finger and the rabbit will lick it off. well I had diffcult with that because my rabbit took one siff of the stuff and did'nt like the smell of it at all. Maybe they should try makeing bannana and carrot flavors because she does not like it. I have to have my mom hold her down while i try and wipe it on her face that works for her."
1,Worst Movie I've Ever Seen,I enjoy zombies. I enjoy bad B movies. This thing is just a failure. I can't believe a company actually distributed this. I could of filmed this myself with a VHS camcorder and it still would of looked better. Avoid at all costs.
1,COHEN BROTHERS?,"Cohen brothers, not to be confused with Coen brothers. This fine Zombie production, shot in super VHS starts out with the character build-up of our three main characters. Cody (Jason McClain) is our cocky bike rider. Tom (Dave Competello) is his boss at his day job and bike mechanic. Lori (Rachel Diana) is a groupie and girlfriend to Cody.While racing they encounter motocross zombies from hell who target them for death. Fortunately our team are second amendment enthusiasts, without which we would surely succumb to zombie infestations.The film is bad on all levels. Just when you think it is getting into gear, they run the credits. The acting, plot, and dialouge are all horrendous. Only one real zombie special effects, the other zombies are smart enough to wear helmets. I can't recommend even for camp value.Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, no nudity."
2,horrible sound quality thankfully due to horrible dialogue,This movie has remarkably bad production quality despite some interesting motocross clips. The sound quality and writing are especially bad.The acting poor and the story dissolves into a bland mess. The package arrived broken and that should have been a hint. It's amusingto see how inconsistent the lighting is. I.m not even sure how someone does that. Still congrats on getting it made and distributed.
2,"Yes, it's Fritz, but it's Fritz 2","This is Fritz. But there is one problem:It is the second edition.The tenth version is only about $20. I'd say that Fritz10 has more than twice the stuff in this program.The things they do have are quite lacking too-it's just not worth the money.(And yes, it is quite strong for average players, but just playing against the computer isn't nessecarily the best way to improve.)"
1,A dud ! A palpable dud !,"I chose an IOGEAR product because of the 3 year warranty. I know of no other company offering more than 1 year. Unfortunately, despite spending 2 days trying to get this thing to be recognised by any of 3 computers that I tested it on, I failed miserably. Was I unlucky enough to get one of the rare duds that fell between the cracks or is IOGEAR Quality Control non-existent? To heap insult upon injury I had to pay the shipping to return this useless object to the ""The Nerds.Com""."
4,Love it!,"Went together easy, looks great, very comfortable, all that it says it is. My wife is very hard to please and I gave her this for mothers day, and she wants me to find more from this manufacturer! How can I say more?"
5,i like this record,"is the best latin dance music! is a beautiful girl from brazil. i know the video clip. play in puerto rico tv show, channel 18."
5,Real Information - Necessary Read for Theater Managers,"I plan on having every employee in my building read this book. I have found no other book that is actually insightful and informative about my sometimes lonely & always hard-fought profession - running a non-profit performing arts center. It was truly wonderful to hear other voices on the subject, especially those who are established leaders in the field. The author has provided invaluable information on doing just about everything my staff and I do on a day-to-day basis; we all think we're doing our best, but this book helped me see other ways of doing my job that might make time spent at work more efficient and (maybe, just maybe) less stressful. I highly recommend this book to anybody involved in operating a theater."
3,The war years and after,"Another well researched and fair evaluation of one of WWII's most notorious charcters. Otto Skorzeny once again had a certain amount of influence over the content, giving his last interview before his death from a war wound in 1976. The book provides an entertaining and intriguing perspective on the development of German special forces, as well as Skorzeny's own colourful personal life. Whilst Charles Foley's book 'Commando Extraordinary' goes into the German commando exploits of the war in far greater detail, this book reviews most of Skorzeny's postwar activites, a field previously not written about. Not only does it reveal several key examples of allied treachery and wrongdoing towards the end of the war years, but also a slightly lighter and poignant side to Skorzeny, demonstrating his loyalty to his country and comrades, not it's regime. Essential for anyone interested in the man himself, but not one to start with."
5,This Show Rocks!!,"I believe this is the best show on television. It's the only show I watch anymore - it makes other shows hard to watch. It's *that* good.I have the season 1 DVD which I have watched several times already (I have invited several friends over to turn them on to the series), and have been anxiously awaiting this new set!Personally, I feel like season 2 has been the best one yet. The characters are deep and interesting, and all have realistic traits and flaws. The plot keeps you on the edge of your seat. You won't be able to stop watching this show.I can't wait for season four to start! :)"
1,"organization skills bad, needs to check their own merchandise!!","I ordered the second season of sopranos, I received the order promptly but when I opened the box which was a second season box, it contained third season DVDs. I am very upset now I have two sets of third season soprano DVDs. I Want a refund!!!"
2,Soprano's Second Season,Unfortunately there was an issue with one of the DVD's included. We could only watch 3 of the 4. Third disc would not work.
3,The Sopranos - Second Season,The Sopranos is a favorite show of mine and I ordered this product as a gift for my grandson who also loves the Sopranos.
3,Second Season Was Not The Best,"If you're a Soprano's fan, then you probably will want to go out and buy this DVD package. After all, you can have the show on a quality medium and in an organized fashion. If you're not a Soprano's fan, don't buy this series. Buy the first season. It was edgier, better written and generally more enjoyable. As person who has seen all three seasons, I'd definitely say the 1st season was best, followed by seasons 3 and 2. After watching season 1, you will then be able to tolerate season 2 which for some reason or another, the writers decided to torment loyal fans with. If it wasn't for season 3, I'd say that season 2 almost made this series ""jump the shark.""The only question now is when will HBO finally air season 4 or have they even started shooting it yet?"
5,Greatness continued,"The second season of the Sopranos offers more characters, more character development and more great plot lines. While it doesn't have the ""freshness"" of the first season, It more than makes up for it in quality. Great acting, great directing. A great story told simply and wonderfully. They resorted to more gimicks in the third season, but Season 2 retains the feel of the first season. If you liked season 1, you'll like season 2. More of the same and just as good."
5,The Sopranos series,"Don't hesitate, purchase the complete series. If you enjoy suspense, you will love it. No Cons at all, Pros, HBO has some of the best writers to backup the quality of this show. The Sopranos is very addictive along with most other series's from the HBO Collection. This is my absolute favorite series of all time."
3,makes me want to condone pirating,"""List price: $99.98""? These guys have some nerve to ask for a hundred bucks for these four dvds. Only the best masterpieces ever are worth $25 a pop, and that's usually with some phat package or some new screen format; there are hardly even any special features on here. While I agree that Sopranos is one of the greats, the first season is the only one that really needs to stand tall in the historical movies vault.DVD companies have forgotten about the lower price that's supposed to come with bulk purchases. Why have high prices remained, even increased, constant even as DVD popularity/essentiality increases?Seriously, HBO is trying to gouge you guys. At the very least, you should rent it first, or watch it on your computer."
4,"Cartoon characters, but addictive","If you sit and watch back to back episodes of this HBO classic, you see that the characters are really quite cartoonish, especially Tony Soprano and his sidekick Steven Van Zandt (of Bruce Springsteen's band). The hair and makeup and clothing are really quite comedic, as is the funny dialogue, which is not intentionally funny. The psychiatrist angle, which gets all the attention, is really the least interesting part of the show. Every time Tony sits down with the shrink, the action stops cold, and the shows lose a beat or two. Season 2 has a lot of good plot lines, and some interesting rub-outs of Mafia guys who turn or else make the wrong move. James Gandolfi hasn't been seen much since the series ran. I wonder whatever became of him? Tony Soprano is a role you can't shake, like Seinfeld. He's stuck with it for life."
1,The Sopranos-Second Season,"I received my DVD Soprano set 2 weeks after I ordered it. I did not received a response for my purchase until 3 days later after I emailed them and the item was already shipped out without an option of rush delivery.Upon receipt, I returned the set and now two weeks later, still not a word about my refund!Very disappointed with the customer service although the package did arrive safely via regular mail."
5,The Sopranos: The Complete Second Season,My husband was so happy to receive this series for Christmas. We have been enjoying the discs together. Arrived in excellent shape.
5,Best season so far...,"Most fans of the show find themselves complaining about the current year, always pointing back to a previous season where the writing was better, the stories easier to relate to, the acting more authentic. But friends, Season 2 of The Sopranos was an absolute masterpiece.From the full enjoyment that comes from a rise to power, to the terrible trouble a future brother-in-law could make, to a friend who's become your most dangerous liability.The trip to Italy was a load of fun to watch. Richie Aprille making a big deal about a leather jacket was absolutley hysterical. Tony's visits with Dr. Melfi were full of just enough agita. Janice was just sly enough to keep your wondering about her loyalties.I'm getting this, and I'm going to enjoy it over and over. I suggest you do the same. This is definitely worth every penny."
5,Bought It As A Gift,I bought the 2nd season for my dad who lives in Europe. I sent him season one last year and he was hooked. I myself really enjoyed the series and was sorry to see it end.
5,Incredible,"We love scones, but oat scones are even better. And with currants, too. This is a wonderful mix, and the oats add needed fiber to a scone, normally a treat and not nutritionally all that good for you.If you can find Bob's Red Mill Scottish Oats, you will also enjoy a terrific breakfast porridge."
3,"good, but a bit dry","These scones sound scrumptious, but were a bit disappointing. Maybe the cinnamon is what dried them out. I am going to make my next batch with whipping cream or half and half, but when made with water, they were too dry. I'd rather make homemade biscuits than pay for these. They are worth the try, but you should buy just one and see if you like it before you commit to the pack."
4,Women are right! Good things do come in small packages...,"I found this book very helpful ...it starts with mating patterns (that we all should know , but of course forget...)and tactical devices. It covers pawn structures and levers(which i found especially helpful) and later goes into attack on the opponents king ( conditions and methods). What I like about this book is it's brevity. Some people may argue that it's too short, but in my opinion it covers the essential material while not making the book a chore to read. Ask any chessplayer, and he or she will tell you about their fantastic collection of chess books they HAVEN'T read. This book will be an excellent study for anyone under 1700 and because of it's smaller size, will be a good refresher course for those who have already covered the material."
5,Great Chess Reading,The authors of this book obviously knew their stuff. They intuitively described how to handle all kinds of situations in the middlegame. In my opinion you couldn't buy a better book for learning the Middlegame thouroughly!
2,This book is trying to do too much in too little space.,The main problem of this book is that it is trying to cover all of the main middle game topics in one thin book. The first section deals with pattern recognition. This is a very important skill. Kosten lists about 24 basic mating patterns and recomends that someone not familiar with them should learn them. He then gives examples for about six of them. I don't think that even the author would think that anyone will learn the basic mating patterns by reading this. The book of combinations by Polgar is an excellant example of a book that will give a lot of practice in finding mating patterns. He also gives pawn play in the middle game a very short treatment.
2,There are Better Ways to Spend Your Money,"The section showing the 26 basic mating patterns is very handy. The rest of the book does not provide nearly as much value, especially at the price."
3,This is an ok steamer,This steamer has some good and bad features. I found the steam pressure alright. There was enough to do the job. What I found bad was the accessories . They don't hold up even after only using them once. Accessories are important for steam cleaners and these just don't make the grade. This is my 2nd steam cleaner and though this is not as good as my first one which was more expensive. This is acceptable.. Also do not pick it up by the handle as the handle does not lock in. With a few improvements this could be decent.
4,Steam-cleaning excellence,"The SteamFast SF-275 which I've had for approximately 2 months now is an extremely efficient household appliance. It generates steam quickly, doesn't clog, and holds a sufficient amount of water to generate steam for thorough cleaning. The attachments work well, and I can only think of simple tweaks such as increasing the length of the flexible hose, maybe adding a carrying strap to facilitate cleaning on the go, and adjusting the handle trough, to make the product even more efficient.I've cleaned with other steam cleaning products such as those made by Shark, and it's not even a contest - the SteamFast SF-275 is, in my opinion, much more efficient."
4,Steam cleaner,I was warned when buying a steam cleaner that many of them only work for a short period of time before needing to be replenished with water. This model works for a good hour and I usually wear out before it does.
3,Not for me,My initial search for a steam machine was to clean smoker grates. I spotted the SF-275 in one of the suppliers I use for sausage goods. If you're looking a time saver cleaning grates this is not the machine for you. When using the small nozzle it produces a decent amount of steam. The rest of the accessories the steam is minimal. Just not what I need to do the job requiredI'm back to the car wash.
4,So far so good,"The only reason I don't rate it with five stars is because the attachments don't last to longer actually one of then broke the first day, but then I realized that not always u need the attachments, so now I use them when I just need it, and when not just use it with out any of the attachments, but the steamer is a master piece, the steam last I believe longer than 45 min at water full capacity, you can clean floors, windows, walls, ovens, grills, bathroom tiles, actually you can clean anything u want, just give it a try an you will see u won't regret it. I'm in love with mines."
1,Steaming hot it's not!,I was disappointed in the steam machine. I expected it to do a great job and it only did a good job. I own and operate my own cleaning business and hoped that I'd be able to offer my customers another option. To my dismay it took too long to clean whatever I chose to try it on so that being said I returned my item for a full refund. I am going back to the old saying...if it looks too good to be true it probably is and this was!
5,Super Cleaner!,"I purchased this steam cleaner after doing tons of research and reading other reviews and I bought a winner! I had heard great things about the shark mop but seemed very flimsy to me. The Steam Fast is very light and is easy for me to use even though I have herniated discs. It is very solid and well built also. What impressed me the most however, is how it cleans! I have green grout lines that looked black and after cleaning them, I was truly amazed by how much dirt came off! My friend came over after I cleaned my white tile floor and thought I had put a new floor in! I was also impressed by how well it cleaned my bathroom. I can't say enough about what a great machine this is!"
5,Fabulous For Cleaning Bird Cages,"I bought this for one reason. I needed something to help me with removing dried droppings from bird cages. Let me just say that for this purpose it works just great.I cannot use any chemicals or harsh cleaning products, and nothing, I repeat nothing I have tried works as well as this little machine. Dried bird poo is like concrete, and the steam softens it so I can simply brush & rinse it all away with a garden hose. Now, if you are looking for a machine that will just blow the dirt away while you stand there and say 'gee whiz' this is NOT what you are looking for. A little elbow grease is required, but it will loosen tuff dirt enough so you can easily finish the job. The kind of steam cleaner that just blows away the dirt will cost you anywhere from $500 to $1,000. For less than $100 with free shipping, this machine is a deal that is very hard to beat."
2,Didn't last long,"This item was very reasonably priced; delivered promptly, and worked fine for several months. Then the button which locks the attachments fell out. Live steam poured through that opening and parts were not securely attached. I contacted the seller; returned it w/their emailed label followed by nothing. No communication; no warrantee repair; no credit; no response to phone messages; nothing. Be advised."
1,Very Disappointed,"This is the first time I had purchased a steam cleaner and have been wanting one forever. Needless to say, I was very disappointed when I used it. My oven was not very dirty, but had a few spots from spilling. I used the machine and went over and over it and it would not clean it up. Eventually I had to use a brillo pad and it took it right off. I then attempted to use it on my windows outside and that was a disaster because the hose was not long enough to reach the top of the window so I had to pick the machine up with one hand and try to clean with the other. Very hard to do. The brush attachments were very small and could not be used on bigger items. The only thing I could do with this machine was to steam my floor, but for that I could have purchased just a floor steamer."
3,Okay for price,"1. Works2. Decent steam pressure, but not as high as euro-pro we owned before (was similar in body style)3. Decent load of steam per tank4. Warms up soon enough5. Good long power cord6. Only have had it for 1 monthAfter a couple of uses, the hose apparently crimped. Called customer support, they said okay and shipped new hose."
2,not made to last,Something went wrong after the first use. The steam that came out (not hot at all) of the unit was not hot enough to clean surfaces of any kind. Returned the unit.
4,Could use a handle,Works well. The attachments go together well...Simple...Its very light even with water in it.The thing is You can pull it by the hose or cradle it like a baby to go up stairs. It would have been nice if the cradle on top could be used as a handle
5,Love this steamer,"The perfect machine to get into the cracks and crevices in the kitchen and bath to get everything really clean! Great for showers, toilets, sinks, around the kitchen stove!!!!"
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR $--did not work and could not reach anyone on the 800#,"Very disappointed. The unit heated up water but did not generate steam. I wasted 2 days trying to get it to work, and called the 800# multiple times and never got a human. After I returned the item to the wholesale club, I received a call that evening--from my calls for suppport 2 days prior.My floors still need to be cleaned and I wasted a lot of time and energy on this poorly made product."
4,Dame Edna HIGHLIGHTS This Album,"Your critic writes that Dame Edna's incredible redndition of ""Looooosing My Mind"" is ""The one skippable track"" on this excellent compilation album. Fooey on your lame critic. I bought this album JUST FOR THAT ONE CUT! I enjoyed the entire album certainly, but Edna's magnificent ballad (Never have I been so ready to believe that the singer really is Loooosing her mind!) is the HIGHLIGHT of this melange. Your critic needs to acquire a sense of humor and some taste."
3,Pure escapism,"24It's a fun comic to read just for the heck of it and between new episodes of 24. I liked it to just escape from the pressures of my job and life in general and to be with my hero, Jack Bauer."
5,Nonlinear model-based Process Control,"It is an excellent book which provides model-based process control applications to important refinery processes. Since, mathematcs used in this book is easy to understand, it makes the real-time applications more attractive as reader does not need to spent his time on solving the difficult equations. A very practical book. I really enjoyed reading it as it has answered a lot of questions related to industrial applications in that area."
2,An Old Book with a Homemade Look,"I've just finished my first script. I suppose it's okay, but not awesome. I've read a half dozen books on screenplays. Of those books, this one is likely one of the least helpful. It was writen in 1983!! and hasn't been updated. I suspect that much of the formatting advice this book offers is now out of date, old fashioned to what professional script writers are doing this days. Two newer books I would recommend instead would be CRAFTY SCREENWRITING by Alex Epstein (2002) and HOW NOT TO WRITE A SCREENPLAY by Denny Flinn (1999). You'll get modern formatting information from these books PLUS a lot more useful advice about how to write well."
2,At this point in time nothing much more than a novelty.,"Cole/Haag was written at the beginning of the 1980s and it shows. While there is some moderately useful information on how to lay out a page (white space, description length, etc.) most all of this has been incorporated into modern screenwriting guides. And you certainly do not need to know about how to set up pages for a typewriter any more, thank goodness. Also, their margin guides are not at all standard in Hollywood in the 21st Century. A much better book for screenwriters working in 2011 is ""The Hollywood Standard"" or the old trusty ""Screenwriter's Bible"""" which includes a lot of advice on story and plotting."
1,Im still waiting...,"Its been over two-weeks and I still havent recieved my book, I even e-mailed the person asking when I should be getting my book that I already paid for, still havent heard anything. I hope I get my book soon. I would have been more understanding if someone would have followed up with me after e-mailing them."
3,Pretty Good...but...,"I bought this book thinking it would give me all the technical terms and definitions of a script. It does have some, however I found another book which is more what I was looking for. This book is useful (meaning I did not return it) however, it is not easy to read if you know nothing about scriptwriting to begin with."
5,short sleeve body suit,Purchased this with leggings as a gift for my grandson. Worked out well when we took a vacation to Florida. Very comfortable and adorable. Thank you very much!!!
2,mediocre,"This book tries to cover everything and as a result, covers nothing very well. The beginning of the book, which contains selections from the Bible, is particularly dreadful. Instead of starting with the Torah upon which Judaism is founded, it starts with one of the least accessible parts of the Hebrew Bible: the last few chapters of the book of Job. In fact, the Five Books of Moses are simply unrepresented in this book. Its fiction selections are heavily focused on 19th century Eastern Europe, ignoring much of the rest of Jewish life both before and after that era."
1,Disappointing,"A very disappointing release by my man, Wyclef. He's a musical genius and a true entertainer but misses the mark with this single. Just got one question-where's the remix that combines all the mixes together? The version on the video release? That was tight but it's not found on the single-whut up with that? To interested buyers-save your dough..."
4,A couple notches above the debut,"I originally had a cassette of this back around 1990-91. It showed up at our magazine for review. Cassette got stolen when someone broke into my vehicle and stole my entire tape collection. I'd forgotten about it for years, though I liked it a lot when it was in my possession.I'd read other reviews that the first album was the best, and that this effort showed a 'sophomore slump.' What were those reviewers smoking? The entire first 8 songs cook. It loses a little punch with the last couple, but you're so satisfied with the previous 35 minutes it's more like a gentle fade out.This lost gem of an album is highly recommended for intelligent pop with a big dose of energy."
3,Overproduced,"Smart lyrics, yes, and of course Stanley Clarke's bass playing is always awesome. But too much of this album is over-produced with oh-so-eighties touches. The more they stick to the Animal Logic trio of Deborah Holland, Clarke, and Stewart Copeland, (and David Lindley) the better it stands up 15 years later."
4,Works great,"I got this and it works exactly how it is supposed to. I would recommend a larger one though because when you roll fondant you get creases because it is short. That was my fault for not thinking about that though, just giving everyone else a heads up. And I love this brand, it is durable and does what it it suppose to do."
2,Review of the Wilton Fondant 9 inch Rolling Pin,"Don't bother purchasing this smaller rolling pin--splurge and get the larger Wiltonrolling pin. You are very limited in size with this and forget about rolling fondant large enough to cover a normal size cake. Only useful for rolling out small flowers and designs. Much better than a wooden rolling pin, though!"
3,Super small roller.... but it works.,"This rolling pin is so small!! But I guess I should have read that in the description. The rubber pieces on the side are useless, I took them off because they just got in the way. Even with flour, my fondant stuck to this pin often. It wasn't a horrible roller, I just would suggest something bigger if you plan on rolling fondant to fit a whole cake. For small items this would be good."
2,Waste of money,This was a waste for me - just use your rolling pin instead. This is way to small and takes hours to flatten out the fondant.
1,blacklight,there is nothing to plug it into. the light is there but the plugs look foreign to me and I can't plug them into anything!
1,Review Pelican Stealthlite Rechargeable 2450 Flashlight,"I feel like it is mistake to order this item through Amazon. With this price and the item is not working ! I received the replacement quickly but it still not working so I end up returned and get refund. I hate to comment like "" You got what you paid for"" but this flash light is very expensive but there is no qualilty at all, no wonder we can't compete with the other import item..."
3,"Es resistente al agua, pero no especifica la profundidad",Las caracteristicas del producto dice que sirve para bucear pero no especifica cuanta profundidad aguanta. No la recomiendo para bucear!
1,Pine Ruins Cedar,"This beautiful, rustic cedar log rocking chair was ruined when they put pine rockers on it. A huge disapointment. This should have been disclosed"
5,Very comfortable!,"We purchased this rocker, the love seat and a side table. All of them came with the correct parts and pieces, were easy to assemble (done in 2 hours) and look great on our front porch. Very sturdy and more comfortable than one would expect!"
3,"Great rocking chair, missing parts :-(","This chair came with a shipment of several other furniture items from Lakeland Mills. The shipment of the rocking chair was missing the bag of hardware. As much as I wanted to rate this item a 5, I cannot because the service was so poor. I called the support people, they don't answer the phone at night and don't seem to have an e-mail address. So, I had to call back next day. They said they sent the bag of missing parts to me that day, but, I don't think so. It took an entire week for the bag of missing parts to arrive. Longer than it took to ship the chair!!! I'm rating this product a 3 simply because the chair is great, but, the service was so-so."
4,"Great rustic looks, plus very sturdy - Made in USA","I have some similar looking outdoor furniture I'd picked up at a garage sale years ago; and because of that I purchased this rocking chair and the convenient side-table. It feels extremely durable and I believe it'll last many years if not generations. Yes a few of the wood pieces had splits, but that won't detract from its soundness or durability, to be sure I had a carpenter check it over. You can stain it, paint it or let it weather.A few things to consider before purchase:* A few pieces may have splits - cosmetic only and doesn't detract from the rustic appearance.* Yes, for me it was harder to put together than described; my male friend had no problems using only a few tools (thank you RR!).* The seat is comfortably shaped - but it doesn't rock super smoothly.I still think it's worth the price considering it'll last a long time."
1,"CONTAINS CHEMICAL PARABENS,THINK DES DDT, PARABENS ALL BAD","Avoid this product. If you are unaware, Parabens are endocrine disruptors and this product contains TWO. If you are trying to balance your estrogen dominance you don't want to lather on parabens. Please be aware that products containing chemicals know as paraben are Estrogenic.

2,not as shown,The item as shown did not arrive with the mount and post. The only thing that came was the tambourine.If the mount and post were optional it should have been shown in phantom or noted to be an extra item.
4,"Oh, the humanity!","Dread's second album is not quite as good as their first, but it's still damn funny. While theirfirst albumconsisted almost entirely of Led Zeppelin songs (a couple of songs were Zep/Elvis medleys), this time around only about half the songs are Zeppelin songs. They do some original songs that are quite funny (although ""Forgetting About Business Parts 1 & 2"" aren't really songs, with Part 1 being an intro of the band and part 2 being a ""dub"" collage of various sounds from the album). The band also does it's first Bob Marley song, ""Stir It Up"", which is one of the highlights. ""The Train Kept A-Rollin'"" is an old Johnny Burnette song that Led Zeppelin often performed in concert, and it's another highlight here. Oh, the Zeppelin songs are good, too. If you are a fan of Led Zeppelin who doesn't take Zeppelin too seriously, you will probably enjoy this album."
5,"""no thank you darlin', i'm on a diet""","song remains the same, stir it up, doin the claw, misty mountain hop..great renditions in their unique style and funny as hell. tortelvis and company deliver a 2nd gem!"
1,Trashy music,YOUR REDOINGS OF ZEPPELIN SONGS SUCK!!!!! BE A REAL BAND AND MAKE YOUR OWN DAMN MUSIC...... GOD I WISH I COULD HAVE GIVEN THIS BAND 0 STARS.....
4,Ruben Blades - Todos Vuelven Live 2,Very good music. My understanding is this was recorded in Puerto Rico recently. Wish the quality was a little better. Not sure why they decided to make it two separate DVDs for purchase. I'd prefer to have purchased the two DVDs in one package...
2,Save Your Money,"This book is loaded with inaccuracies, speculation, made up facts,and errors that the author obviously didn't research. Character names are wrong, random facts are made up (i.e. birth dates for major characters) and episode synopses contain incorrect information. The author didn't do his homework. I wish I could get a refund."
5,Worth the price,"This is an amazing look at some amazing people, the kind of thing you want to watch again and again. It's appropriately titled and lovingly made."
1,Useless,She lost me with the addition of ADY into a Sourdough starter. Really was no point in wasting time with the rest of the book.The entire point of using Sourdough is to eliminate the need for commercial yeast. The book has many references to commercial yeast in the recipes.
3,Only if you have no previous experience at all,"This set is okay...if it is your very first step into the field of film-making. If you have any experience, or have even read a couple books, this will have little new to offer. For the money, you're better to go with Dov Simmons course or the Hollywood Camera Work Course (highly recommend)"
4,Some obscure stuff--but also some hard-to-find goodies...,"IRS was never exactly a mainstream label, so you're not going to find a bunch of major pop 12"" versions here. But there are some definite classic alternative hits in 12"" form. Tracks:1. tired of getting pushed around...2men a drum machine and a trumpet (6:32)2. prepare to energize...torch song (5:29)3. fire and mercy...william orbit (5:20)4. is there anybody in there...hunters & collectors (5:15)5. the sheep's a wolf...cauterwaul (5:30)6. the crack...cosmetics (5:55)7. tenderness...general public (6:00)8. so excited...ranking roger (6:06)9. mad about you...belinda carlisle (5:03)10. blue kiss...jane wiedlin (6:12)11. good together...candi & the backbeat (7:40)"
1,What???,"Well I only like one song in this album, ""One She Ass."" All the others sound terrible. His voice is totally worn out! Ugh! Can someone tell me what kind of a horrid name ""Back Room Blood,"" is? This album is a waste of your money. Unless, these terrible songs appeal to you, let this album go!!!!! Get Carole King instead, she's great!!!!!!"
4,Efficient,"Love the hands free for my portable phone. Comfortable to use but do not connect while using the phone, attach prior to conversation."
4,Decent Chair Set,"Not a bad chair set. Good quality, easy to assemble. With a little stain and some construction adhesive in the joints and this is a great buy."
3,"It was good - not great, but good.","Okay, I have yet to read another Barbara Delinsky book, so I only have other authors' writings to compare to. The overall story was easy to read, entertaining and realistic - the characters were likable, and the premise was generally believable. It just seemed to - generic - for me, I guess. No outstanding characters - Olivia, the main, was the typical single mother hurt by men and determined to make it on her own. Natalie was the matriarch whose work went unacknowledged for most of her life. I felt like I had met all of these people before, but maybe that was the idea. The climax of the story was great, and while I expected it to happen (I won't give anything away, I promise!) - it was done with finesse. Overall, I would like to read another Barbara Delinsky book, if only to compare notes."
3,Harlequin Delinsky,"Please understand; this woman can write. But good writing can never overcome bad plot. Even Shakespeare couldn't pull that off!This story is so incredibly predictable that the journey to the end of a 350 page book palled long before the destination was reached. The one interesting device (the story within a story.. the historical tale) was certainly not enough a strong enough vehicle to carry the lump of the main tale. I've enjoyed several of Delinsky's works, but this one just became boring; I'll be more careful before I purchase the next."
3,A nice story....but....,"the story has two plot lines going at the same time. Usually I have an easy time following both, but I felt that I got bogged down in all that was happening. I enjoyed the book, but I wanted it to flow faster, to get a move on. The story line follows a young woman who has been hired to write the biography of an elderly woman. The older woman's past twists into her present and is explained well, but sometimes I just wanted to reach other pull the story faster. It was a book I couldn't wait to get through."
1,"Trite, trite, trite - HELP!","I struggled through this book - my first Delinsky book. I read it because my book club wanted to read it. I almost didn't make it through the entire book and I wonder what the other book club members will have to say. For me, it was like sitting in front of the TV watching a bad daytime soap opera. I found it to be a waste of time and I was happy that the length of the book was the only real challenge for me. I thought Olivia's character - she sleeps with Simon after only a month of staring at one another from across the lawn - was weak and uninteresting, sappy and whiny. To top it off, she and Simon sleep in the same bed with the 10 year old daughter in the next room and this is considered a great romance!! Pullease. I can't think of a single thing other than perhaps the discussion of how the grape vines ripen that was interesting to me. Yuck. I'm on to The Da Vinci Code - THANK GOD!DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME - READ A GOOD BOOK."
1,Is there an editor?,Very predictable plot. A computer editing program that does not know when to use were and when to use was.
4,A Sweet Read,"I enjoyed this book. It's a little schmaltzy at times, but it held my interest and kept me reading. It's an unlikely love story, but the reader is treated to a lot of information about grape growing and wine making."
4,A dark and powerful release,"this is the 2nd severe illusion disc, and while it may not exactely top D.I.R.E. it is equally great. S.Ill. stay true to their intense and pummeling style of electronic distortion. Emphasis is on crushing power and distortion. Even a 'club' track like Natural Causes is akin to older Suicide Commando, maybe even heavier. When I DJ (radio) I get frequent calls for this act b/c of their heaviness. No future-pop anthems here.This disc is a concept album revolving around the life of Belgium's King Leopold II who conquored the African Congo at the turn of the last century. During which, he slaughtered millions of the natives, and enslaved the rest. His penchent for cruelty is depicted in such songs as 'Congo by Force' and 'No hands' (b/c he liked to have them cut off). Favorite tracks are 'Open rebellion', 'Natural Causes', 'Girl with knife in hand','beautiful', and 'The giant never speaks enough' - all bone-crushing heavy. Total 17 tracks - 74+ minutes of imperialist hell"
2,not sticky enough..,"The 3M Blue Tape is much better, this stuff isn't sticky enough, even on a completely flat surface with no texture it came off too easy, meaning it didn't do its job properly."
2,Sounds like a movie soundtrack,"I did not like this CD for relaxing meditation. First, there were too many interruptions -- there are 10 brief tracks. As soon as you get into one, it ends, and another totally different one begins.Second, this music sounds like it should be in ""Braveheart"" when Mel Gibson's girl is killed and he's seeking soulful revenge via horseback with hair flying. That's all I could picture!"
1,Best read from book,These stories are so boring on the CD. Some of the books selected do not work well on a CD and read so straight through it was painful. Where is the lilt in the voice and the bounce that makes Seuss fun? I am not happy this is just sitting in our collection now.Don't buy this. Read the books with the little ones in your life and keep Seuss interesting!
1,Don't waste your money,"As great as Dr. Seuss is, this package is terrible.Most importantly, the readings/performances of these stories are BORING! These are some of the most imaginiative, fun-to-read stories on the planet and the performances have all the enthusiasm of an insurance seminar.Anoher gripe is that it's just the two CDs -- no book or additional packaging that's fun for the kids to look at (which maybe was my fault for assuming otherwise).Plus, there are two CDs when it seems like they could have piled it all together on a single disc. I suppose they wanted to include more stories, but it ends up being a more of a pain to make sure you have the 'right' disc for the story your kids want. If there wasn't enough room on one CD, cut one of the weaker performances -- there were plenty to choose from.Overall, this was a big disappointment. Our family loves Dr. Seuss, but this package doesn't do him justice."
3,Creepy Music from a Good Movie,"First of all, I highly recommend the movie Disturbing Behavior. It's pretty good entertainment, even if a little strange and (dare I say it?) disturbing. This CD, however, was useless; I could not wait to get rid of it. As I recall (I already sold it, so am going from memory), the music is just a lot of weird sounds, which flow and ebb based on where they fell in the movie sequence. Standing alone, this music is just not enjoyable, and will never be good mood music . . . unless you're trying to set the mood for a very whacked out Halloween party. <grin> If I were you, I'd definitely save my money; there are much better choices out there."
5,Great item!,Nice for the price does exactly as i wanted pushes the amps i need for my 2-600watt Subs Has 8 blue LED lights near edges where the silver and black meet. Great amp overall iv had 2 other legacy amps and they work perfectly fine i dont think i would get a better deal for amps through hardly any other brand with the quality as well. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a decent dependable amp! Oh and the bass control does work like it says. I have one other legacy amp about 3 years old the control quit working but the amp works perfectly fine without it hooked up either way you got the bass you want and quality! Good luck buyers hope this helped!
2,Beware!!!!,I bridged this Rebel 959 to power one Boss Audio 500 watt rms and 1000 watt max and it sound good. I hooked it up to 2 kickers 400 watts rms and 800 watt max and will cut out when bridged but it will run when unbridged but you can't hear anything. I would advise you to use this with one sub only.
3,"Oxford CDTA Cocktail Table (36"" x 24"" Surface)","This is a very nice table, but if you're looking for a table to use wuth an umbrella keep looking. Very sturdy."
5,Enzo Ferrari starring Sergio Castellitto,"What a rivitting movie! The movie deals briefly with Enzo Ferrari's childhood and young adult years, then mostly from WWII until the early 60's. There are other brief flashes into the 70's and 80's, but not much. The main theme of the movie are the events that shaped Enzo Ferrari's life, and not so much about actual racing or running a racing team. The story focuses mainly on his personal life, the two women in his life who each gave him a child, and how conflicted he felt with people getting killed in his cars. The great news is that this movie would appeal to racing fans and non-racing fans (read: wives) because it is more a human interest story than a hard core gearhead movie. With the blessing of Piero Ferrari, Luca de Montezemolo and the Ferrari factory, the historic racecars gathered for the scenes are amazing!"
4,Enzo Ferrari,"A very good movie. Enzo is a very successfull man in the automobile business but not his marriage life. His desire, confidence, passion for cars never stops... watch this movie if you're really a Ferrari fan. You got to know how he manage his life."
4,Ferrari,"This was a good product, nicely packaged still in its original wrapper. I would recommend this movie to any car guy or anyone interested in how Enzo Ferrari went from racer to owning the biggest sports car company in the world. It is a long movie so make sure you have an afternoon off to watch the whole thing."
2,KINDA BORING,"there is nothing exciting in this film. the whole storyline is a boring narrative form, lots of talking. two romances, two sons, race cars. lots of wheel and logo shots. blah, blah and blah. i don't think people would like to pay to see this, unless it's for free viewing on the tube. absolutely no charisma from the actor who played ferrari. boring script, dialog, nothing dramatically interesting at all."
3,Apple at it again,"Physically, it is a very nice computer. It doesn't hold up to Apple's ""It just works"" mantra. I wish I had held off until all the bugs were worked out and software developers had introduced their software. I can't run windows because virtual PC doesn't work. I can only see half of my company's web site. So much for getting any work done at home. I haven't been able to view wmv files and don't try to update to the newest version of quicktime. It won't work. I am done defending Apple. My next computer will be a PC ."
1,"Rosetta renders this mac not ready. Sluggish, and not fully tested.","As a MAc lover I sad;y must report that this model isnt ready for public consumption. I have used this machine extensively and find it slower than the G5 in many instances and just barely faster in ones it runs natively. I am getting results of 10-20% faster instead of 100-200% that Apple had reported. and this machine LOVES Ram. If you are one of the brave ones get the MAX Ram you can because with all the translating, it needs it!!! For me, the G5 is much more stable and the Intel models, until all programs run natiely and without Rosetta, just doesnt improve things enough to switch at this time.Be careful witht this model until Apple works out the kinks. Its far from being ready for us IMO. I would get the iMac 2.1 G5-iSight model 20"" to be exact if I were you."
1,I will not purchase another Apple product in a very long time,"The product is fine, but Apple probably has the worst customer support I have ever experienced. Their amount of topics on their on-line support is not broad enough. It is only helpful if you have very simple problems (like if you're having problems ejecting a CD from your drive), but for more complicated problems the on-line support is completely useless. Their phone support is even worse. I waited on the phone for 45 minutes to talk to a customer support person so he can tell me he would only help me if I paid more money. Next time I'll buy a PC with Dell or Gateway. Like I wrote, the product is fine, but part of the reason for choosing a particular PC is for customer support. Because I believe Apple's customer support to be horrid, I will not be purchasing another Apple product for a very long time."
5,My third iMac!!,"Yes, the deal of the century. I do declare. This puppy is my 4th Macintosh (& my 3rd iMac machine). I am proud to say that I built an entire company from this ""value in a box""... see Total Escape dot com. Since technology changes so dang fast, it's of the utmost importance that I upgrade every 5 years to a new computer. I find this one to be the best bang for the buck. The screen is so clear & refreshing. This new sleek design is the coolest I've ever seen & the speed is very adequate, considering my high speed connection is traveling across many mountains to reach me."
2,Vertical lines on display,After 2 years and 3 months two vertical lines appeared on the LCD. A quick search on Google tells me this is a common problem for iMac's from late 2005 early 2006. Called Apple and was told I would have to pay about for the repair. According to other people with the same problem complaining on several forums this repair costs about $700.
5,excellent,I am very happy with this product. The i-photo and i-movie software is great and so user friendly. It's a great computer.
2,not for professional graphic designers,"I had a G4 titanium laptop then ""upgraded"" to the iMac because they said it was fast and would run the Adobe CS stuff better -- not. I miss my laptop. The iMac gets hung up at least half the time when it does ANYTHING, even opening a folder takes 4 seconds. Shutting down the computer if you have a bunch of stuff open takes like 10 minutes. Multiple Adobe products do not like to be open at the same time on my computer - pretty much every day one will crash if another is open."
4,"It's verry nice, no?","Pros -- it's a MAC! The thing just works, very stable, UNIX geeks can dig and play in BSD-land, Boot Camp is a piece of cake, making Windows XP co-existence a reality, great bundled apps. And it's beautiful...My wife (a computer hater by nature) LOVES it!Cons -- Lack of expandability, should come with 1 GB RAM by default."
5,ONE OF THE BEST CD'S IN MY COLLECTION.,"When I first played this cd the His voice and the African speaking drums were truly great. if anything porchlight is probably my favorite but it is very hard to choose. I regularly play this to friends and hope they like it and possibly go out and get a copy. I would love to see him in concert. he did do a song on one of our tv channels, he had green hair and I dont think the british public were ready for him but they should have listened and they would of heard a great performer."
5,Tell My Feet,"I had a lyric from Vinx's first album ""Rooms In My Fatha's House"" running through my mind for nearly a week. Unable to find a sample anywhere, I was on a mission. I needed to hear something, anything. That's when I came across it here. I decided to buy the album, mainly because I saw that this album could be had for next to nothing (especially, considering what it's proven to be worth). When it arrived I was amazed to find that, though it had been over ten years, I still remembered the entire album as though it were yesterday. Such a great album, I look forward to passing my love of it to my children."
5,"funky, palm raising, jump 2 your feet, melt in you mouth",A definate keeper. This album pushed you through a range of emotions and always leaves you wanting more.
1,DISAPPOINTED,"I'm very disappointed with this product because the picture the picture does not match the product, picture should place a thermometer and not the bath... this make me get something wrong... bye..."
3,Just OK..............,"If it had the original recordings, it'd be a whole lot better! I do like some of these ""Drew's Famous,"" recordings for other celebrations!"
3,"It's not Skeleton Man, but it's OK.","This book, based on tales told by Native Americans in the Northeast, is a story by Joseph Bruchac, a member of the Abenaki tribe. I couldn't help but compare it to Skeleton Man by the same author and the same premise of taking a traditional story and putting it in contemporary society. The characters never became alive in this story. It's an excellent story of itself, but the story is the thing here, not the characters.If you read Skeleton Man and loved it, you'll like The Dark Pond. If you liked The Dark Pond, read Skeleton Man, you'll love it."
5,"Fantastic, durable product","So far so good with these dog tag silencers. Our pet store stop selling silencers. I am such a light sleeper, I needed a silencer for my dogs. I had two bell shaped tags that I couldn't find a silencer bell shaped. I bought these and they fit! Not to mention they seem more durable than the others I have previously bought. My dogs wrestle a whole lot. They are very active. So, this seems to work out for them. I highly recommend them!"
2,"Works, but poor quality.","These dog tag silencers do perform their function, but they are very cheap looking and poor quality. They fit incredibly tightly and it seems like they will probably rip soon. My dog tags aren't oversized or anything like that. If you want something that does silence the dog tags, these will work, but I can't say how long they'll work for."
2,These are round.,These are round. I expected them to be shaped like dog tags. Were too small to be useful to me.
4,Works fine,"I ordered this ink for my Epson Stylus Photo R320. I just couldn't resist the price--about 1/10th of the OEM cartridge! This cartridge looks a little different but it snapped into the ink slot just fine, and seems to be working fine so far. The print is maybe just a teensy bit fuzzier than with the OEM cartridge, but when I'm printing plain black text it's really for my own unfancy home use so it doesn't matter to me. I probably wouldn't order this ink if I were printing business materials, but it works fine for casual home use."
4,Hard to read but worthy... from chapter 4 on,"It seems to be two books in one. The first chapters, specially 3 are really hard and after reading several times, when the light starts to turn on... you find typing errors!!. The relation stated on the paragraph you have just read - and understand - can not be correct because then, the previous one is not posible... Crazy!!Anyway, just passing over those 3 first chapters and dedicating your time to those from 4 on it is a very recomended reading to get to understand some more on Elliott's theory."
5,Amazing!!!!!! The Best!!!!!,"""...what a feast of ideas for both novice and experienced Elliotticians! Every sentence is devoted to something important. (Neely) has obviously spent a lot time on the illustrations to ensure the reader will understand the concepts."" Bruce Badcock, Commodity Traders Consumer Report"
2,Neely Wave is more like it,"I'm not sure what Mr. Neely should best call his analysis technique, but it is most definitely not Elliott Wave...this book would have to be the Apocrypha/Pseudepigrapha to the Precter and Frost canon."
1,very difficult,"Very hard to understand, if you can read, understand and enjoy this book at all you could probably give the boys a hand in Egypt with the Hieroglyphics ........If you enjoy scientology well this one's for you!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,very good book,"This is a good book if you want to expand on Elliott Wave analysis. I would not recommend it to the beginner. For a person familiar with the basics of Elliott Waves this book is gold. It shows you how to think outside of the square as far as how patterns should and can look. It made me realise that most of my wave analysis was flawed.Some of the book is overkill, and i did not read some parts as they seemed to be overcomplicating things, especially the Neely system of labeling. Why reinvent the wheel.This guy has obviously been very thorough in his work. He is obviously a very methodical thinker and objective observer.I am very glad I bought this book, it has helped the unexplainable to become clear."
1,Disapointing,"The author warns us at the begining that the book and the theory will be difficult and confusing, he is right.I shouldn't have bouth this, I would ask for a refund if I could."
4,A Masterpiece but could be better organized,"A superb treatise of practical application of Elliott wave behavior, but one has to do a lot of traveling back and forth for certain rule applications. For example, there is quite a lot of information about different kinds of patterns, but it is scattered across many chapters.Also if Neely had included real life examples of actual markets it would have been even better.The chapter on the first set of rules could have been made a little more user friendly.All in all, an essential book for every aspiring market technician and theorist alike."
2,Not for the majority.,"This book is very complictated. One might have a chance if this book was treated as textbook and offered in a university over a semester long class, taking each chapter apart with live examples.Other reviews mention that it takes years to master this method.I somewhat agree. The rules of logic are not clear and that is mainly because if the autor wanted to go to great lenght to explain everything this book would be around 2000 to 3000 pages. So, you gonna have to figure it out on your own and that will take you a lot of time!Get an Elliot Wave Charting software you'll save yourself a lot of headache and time."
5,Glenn Is the best analyst I have yet to encounter,"""This book provides the most complete explanation of Elliott Wave Theory available. With proper study, the reader should be able to master with complete understanding the technicalities of the Elliott Wave Theory."" Larry Jacobs, Traders World Magazine"
1,It does not fit.,"I got this for my 1998 Nissan Pathfinder. The resistor part itself and the base fit into the blower housing, but the connector is just slightly too thick and will not plug in to the OEM harness. I have another one on order from my local Autozone, but I will probably run into the same problem and end up getting it from nissan."
2,Reel: Fine - Rod: Bad,"The reel works good. I like the trigger function, and it casts and retrieves smoothly enough. The rod, however, was no good. As I was preparing it for my first cast, I noticed a crack in it and soon after it sort of just fell apart. I just gave it two stars because of the reel, which I will just put on a different rod. Overall, it looks good and is low cost, but still not worth it."
5,Nighthawks,"A permanent staple in blues music -------- have been seeing them for over 25 years -------- never disappointed, buy CD, (now Amazon does send out alot of cracked cd cases though ) don't download- own the actual CD people."
4,Comfortable and flattering.,Cute feminine pumps. Very easy to wear all day. The leather has a strong odor so be prepared to leave them in the garage till it wears off!
5,Very comfortable shoes,"These shoes are great! They are so comfortable, and so cute. I got compliments all day at work. There is no break in time at all. I will definitely buy Clarks again."
4,Great Product. Overpriced?,"I use this product in my new MacBook Air 13"". It fits great and protects the screen/keyboard and does a nice job of wiping the screen clean. Very soft, thin. In fact, so un-noticable that mine got thrown out in the trash when I wasn't looking! Replacing mine. Think for a piece of material it is overpriced, though."
5,ITS AWESOME,ITS AWESOME cleans my Macbook Pro 13' screen and comes in handy when closing the Macbook so it won't get stained
4,Works well,"I needed something to protect my new Macbook Air and its screen, and the ScreenSavrz cloth seems to do the trick. I've only been using it for a few weeks, so we'll see how it stands up to longterm use, but so far it has protected my screen and given me peace of mind when shutting the laptop. Pleased so far."
5,My favorite screen cleaner,Prevent prints from my silicon keyboard skin the on the screen. Also excellent for cleaning dust and fingerprints from screen. Highly recommend. Durable well-constructed material.
3,Not as pictured,"It is a lot slimmer then the picture shows. It isn't anything like a mouse pad (which it advertises to be used as as it's secondary use). It never fully uncurls. I have had it for 4 months and kept it straight during the time (while in my closed laptop and placed under my laptop when not being functional as a screen protector or ""mouse pad"") and it still curls up when I let it run free. It gets bends and kinks in it very easily but it does the job of protecting my screen from finger oil smudges from the keyboard when I close my laptop."
2,No proofreading,"As another reviewer noted, the publisher of this translation couldn't even bother to proofread the finished product. The fact that even a casual reader can find countless typographical errors is, unfortunately, one of the few interesting things about this book. Delibes came highly recommended to me; perhaps one has to read him in the original."
1,The Heretic,"THE HERETIC by Manuel DelibesI saw a review of this book in the New York Times, and it seemed quite interesting and different, since most of what has been written about the Spanish Inquisition is connected to the Jewish people. My native tongue is Spanish, so I bought a copy in that language. Frankly, I found the book slow, boring, and the language is too descriptive in an uninteresting way. I hope that Mr. Alfred MacAdam's translation into English improved the pace and general feeling of it. I give this book only one star and only for the effort that went into the research to write it."
1,it was a mess,I paid $20 for a book that showed up waterlogged and ruined. I'm highly disappointed in that. I'm glad I didn't pay 300 for the hardback version.
4,Great for preschoolers,"This story has repetitive text that preschoolers adore. The predictability allows kids to finish the sentences for their parents as they read them the story. The characters have funny names (Danish), but the ending can be disturbing for sensitive children. A great story for learning the short a sound or final t sound."
5,An unequalled oppertunity!,"To have a glimse into the life of Anton Bruckner is such a pleasure that I feel deeply grateful to Hans Conrad Fischer for producing this very rare and special 2 hour film.The film documents Bruckner entire life...his triumphs, defeats, joys, passions, friends and enemies from his birth to his death. It reveal to us the Man himself and his extrodinary Art!With scenes and footage from his home, his landscapes, and his travels and workplaces offers us the opportunity to understand and know Bruckner like never before!Not to mention the film is interlaced with excerpts from his Symphonies, Choral and Chamber music!A wonderful achievement!(I hope Hans Conrad Fischer's biography/documentary films will be released on DVD soon.)5 stars!"
4,Spooky....,"Being a native of NS, i can say i like this book. Its perfect for a night when its raining, its dark, and you wanna be spooked. (^^) Well, anyway its a great read, and all the stories are true.(well, sort of) I definitely recommed this book to anyone. -Sheena"
1,Lambeth Resident,"This is a book I would definately put down. It is effectively a collection of ramblings from a demented mind.It anyone meets the author, please break his pencil or trash his typerwriter.Avoid at all costs."
1,Crass,"Whilst I sympathise with the libertarian philosophy espoused by the author, this is one of the worst booklets I have EVER read. It is ill structured, rambling and full of poor English.The author is clearly a nut-job, describing himself as ""cynic, cyberpunk and raconteur"" and oddly claiming that he has ""the mannerism of a 19th century gentleman"". In fact he is a well known fruit cake from Maine.He claims to be an English Lord of the Manor but in fact he was simply a student in the UK who got deported."
4,A must for fans of early Ministry,"A must for fans of early Ministry, this album captures the zeitgeist of the early '90s industrial scene. Cyberpunk, Industrial, EBM, Rivethead etc. Includes a spoken sample from the awesome movie ""Colossus: The Forbin Project."""
2,Wizzard's Best?,"Well, I bought this because I used to love to listen to the 50s music tribute album ""Eddie and the Falcons"" and that album has not been reissued on CD. The tracks from that album on this CD are so good and the rest of the songs are so bad. Wish I could just get a reissue of Eddie and the Falcons."
4,"A brilliant, under appreciated album","The songwriting is wonderful. I came across a promo copy and neglected it for years; when I finally gave it some attention, I was amazed. I've since lost that copy, so I've just bought another. It seems to be out of print. It's a shame that no one seemed to notice this great album."
1,Short and Self-explanatory,"This is a few paragraphs basically saying that if you want to play festivals, don't send them your whole cd, just a few songs, and show up on time/don't be demanding. I honestly feel ripped off that someone would charge money for this. There is no information about how to find festivals or their booking contacts. As a matter of fact it says ""check out websites for more information"". It doesn't even site any websites. If you have ever tried to book a gig anywhere, you could write a better article than this by simply spending ten minutes thinking about it."
3,Knox's Memoirs a Mixed Bag,"Michael Knox's book, while it doesn't contain any earth-shaking revelations, is more thoughtful and less predictable than one might expect. True, he sees the Simpson criminal trial through a racial prism and defines almost everything and everyone in racial terms, and true, his explanations for not letting the court know about his kidnapping charge are far-fetched. But he also has enough sensitivity to report the dynamics of the jury fairly. In fact, since we know he isn't pulling any punches, it's interesting to hear what he thinks of the way the jurors reacted to a lesbian juror, and the way they treated his own family after seeing he has a multiracial group of foster children. There's also an unintended irony in the way Knox concludes his book, since it was written before the criminal trial verdict. Those who disagreed with the first Simpson verdict will be fascinated by this account of what really took place among the jurors."
5,Great series,I enjoy Terry Brooks series a lot and this one is no different. Brilliant writing. This was a part of a series that I needed to complete in my home library and I'm glad to have gotten it.
5,Like no one else,These guys have a wonderful sound you can't help but jam and rock to their sound and amusing lyrics. They are all around feel good music. They are a must have on your play list.
2,My cat kills it,"My cat loves it, but it doesn't last very long. A cats normal hunting mode is (1) catch prey and (2) kill prey. My kitten is fairly good at killing this device even though she weighs less than 6 pounds. The instructions say not to bend the arm back against the motor. My cat didn't read the instructions. My other complaint is the the buttons are where my cat can push them by stepping on them."
3,"Great toy, but breaks often...","My cat is obsessed with this toy, he will lay beside it and stare at it until I turn it on.This item does not hold up to normal cat wear & tear. We probably buy one every 3-4 months. They break frequently. My cat likes to hold on to the toy attached to the wand for a good amount of time once he catches it. I know they are not supposed to do this, but as another reviewer wrote- my cat cannot read the instructions. I gave it 3 stars beacause my cat cannot live without this toy. The company does have quite the racket. They make sub-par toys that your cats make you replace."
2,Weak,"I work in a pet store and have this out on demo. I also have one for my 4 cats at home, so this toy has really been put through its paces over the past few weeks. Verdict: Poor.There are two major problems. Firstly, it's too light - my big 'ol Maine Coon just picked the whole thing up and walked off with it! It also gets pulled onto its side far too easily. It needs to be weighted in the base.Secondly, the wand part just pulls off FAR too easily. It simply slots onto the metal stem with no locking mechanism. I got bored with having to reattach it every few minutes. Also, the more it comes off and on, the looser it gets....so it gets worse over time.When it's upright and in one piece it's an OK toy. The speed adjustment is good and I like the auto-off feature. Hopefully they will tweak the design a bit and it will be worthwhile. As it is, buy the Undercover Mouse instead - much better!"
3,My Cats Ignore It,"I have 3 cats and all three just totally ignore this toy. I was very surprised with their lack of interest since they generally like chasing, jumping, and attacking their other toys. The only time one of my cats even noticed it was when he was really buzzed on catnip and he accidentally stepped on the button, turning it on himself. Then the feathery ball just kept hitting him in the head but, really, that was more entertaining for ME than the cat."
3,Works randomly,"I'm not impressed with the quality of this item. I have to take a battery out to get it to turn off, so the buttons don't work. Mine only goes around in one direction fast or slow. I should have returned for a replacement, but didn't have the box ect..."
2,"fun for the cats, but swinging arm keep coming off","I like the idea of this toy, since it keeps the cats engaged with the random motions.One of my cats really gets into it, and can play with it for a while.The other only sort of swats at it from a laying-down position.The problem is that the swinging metal arm on which the feather toy is attached to only sits on the main part with a metal clamp, and when the cats get into it and jump on it, the arm keeps coming off.So while the cats have fun, I don't, bc I have to keep re-attaching the arm! That's super-annoying.It's sitting in the corner now, unused, and I guess it is back to the crinkly shopping bags on which I have to spend no money at all!"
1,This is a piece of garbage.,This product wasn't working right and they promised to send a new one. They never did. It also falls apart as soon as the cats start to play with it. A total piece of garbage. Not to mention a company that doesn't keep it's word. I will be contacting them again but I am very angry.
2,Shows no interest,"Had figured this would be a good way to entertain our Kitty when no people were around to play with her. She normally likes and shows interest in the wand toys, and since this seemed to have the same ""principle"" (but without the human) I thought she would go for it...but I've thought the same about other products and was wrong, and was also wrong about this one. She did not show any interest in this other than a little intimidation by the swinging arm, even when it was set on the lower speed. I was a little afraid that if she did approach this thing, the yellow arm would bop her or poke an eye, but needless to say it never got that far. She was not intrigued enough to go near it. Still not ready to give up on this, I set it outside one day when a neighbor's cat was visiting. He also did not seem to realize it was there to pique his interest. Returned it."
2,Cats Lose Interest Quickly,"Kittens may find this toy fun, but only three of my five adult cats were mildly curious at first and lost interest quickly. The lure on its string slides onto the end of the rotating stem and is held in place by pressure. After a few minutes, the device tends to fling the lure loose from the stem. There is no automatic shut-off when this happens, so someone must supervise the device or the batteries will run down needlessly. I plan to give the toy to someone with a kitten."
3,Makes a lot of noise,Does anyone else have a panic mouse 360 that is very loud? one of my cats will play with it but the more timid cat runs away from it due to the noise.
2,Maybe for a really young kitten...,"This is one of the first toys I got my cat. He likes it for a little while, but quickly grows bored. I'm talking about 3-5 minutes, if that. It's easily caught, and once he catches it, that's enough for him. He might try again a few times, but then he'll walk off. When he wanted to play, I would turn this on for him and he would come back to me like, ""no, YOU play with me!""I think it's just not enough to keep a smart cat entertained. He loves wands, that I have to move on my own. He likes to stalk it, and then just as he's about to pounce--I move it! It's great fun for the both of us. This thing just lets him catch it. Boooooring."
5,Panic Mouse,Panic Mouse is a big hit with my 5 month old Chartreux. The plastic wand came right off in minutes so I secured it with a cable tie and electrical tape and it has stayed on. My kitten kept flipping the unit over so I drilled holes in each of the feet and screwed them down to a 3/4 inch piece of plywood. The 15 minute timer is perfect.I have started to use only the slower speeds and my kitten will hide and sneak up on his prey. On the faster speeds the cat will get really rough with the toy and hold on the mouse and strain the motor. I have had the unit 2 weeks and my cat plays with it at least twice a day.
1,Broke immediately,"Broke within 10 minutes of use. Very expensive and doesn't work. My cats are not hard players, yet our blind cat broke it immediately"
5,Cat loves it!,"Saves you a lot of time of playing with your cat, when you don't have any! It really works and the cat loves it"
5,Outstanding Book - A Must Have,"I recently attended the Autism Society of America conference in Scottsdale, Arizona. I had the pleasure of attending workshops presented by the authors, Maureen Morrell and Ann Palmer. This book received the national award from the Autism Society of America for ""Literary Work of the Year"". This book is a must have!! It will make you laugh and cry while providing you with a wealth of knowledge and information. This book is great for both parents of young children and adult children with autism spectrum disorder."
2,orange color gets damaged by heat,"We got this pretty kettle because we like to leave it out on the stove. I don't want to have to put the kettle in the cupboard every time we want to cook on the stove. Unfortunately, the orange color was badly damaged by the heat of nearby pans. Less than two months later, this kettle is ruined. Though it still works of course, it's very ugly."
3,"Religiously confusing it is, and it does matter.","Mr. Fry's review is right on. I bought this book because the illustrations are exceptionally beautiful and the text is most readable, however upon reading about our guardian angels, for example, the text says things like, 'some Christians believe in their existence.' If I were to read something like that to a class of young students, what kind of impression would that leave in their mind? That belief in guardian angels is optional?! Needless to say, I did not read that page to the students. Bummer though. It's such a lovely book. How about somebody takes the strengths of this book and combine them with the full-strength version of what it means to be Catholic? Now, that would be something to write home about!"
3,"Frustrating Text, Exquisite Art Work","We discovered this book at our local library. My daughter is four and cannot read yet, but loves the art work used in this book like no other saints book we have come across. And, I am happy of that since I find so much other artwork used in children's saints books is so very saccharine and cloying. I wish I could trade out the text used in those other saint books for the religion neutral text used in this book. I ended up buying this book for my daughter because it is several years before she will be able to read this on her own and, for now, I'm able to edit on the fly as I read it to her."
4,Value,"Wonderfully light sturdy frame and low end components. I bought this one for my daughter. I have a similar Schwinn(Super Sport) which I bought at a Big Box Sporting Goods store. I paid $150 more for the exact same frame but a little better line of components. The bike and its components are what I wanted but they sent the wrong size(M) which wasn't even offered on the website. When I called Amazon Customer Service they couldn't tell me if a small would be available, so I elected to keep this one. I'm sure this will serve us well. We ride 15-25 miles every other day."
3,Could be better,"It works pretty well in general, but the volume isn't what it should be. If there's noise in the car, it becomes uusable."
1,I get happy when I hear this album,"This entire album was God sent written. If you have ever lost a parent, listening to I Stood on the Banks of Jordan will put everything in perspective. One suggestion is please don't follow up listening to this recording and then hear, My God can do anything. I guarantee you will get happy."
3,"A Disappointing Follow-up to ""Peace Be Still""","If you are looking for an album that sounds like ""Peace Be Still,"" this probably isn't it. This recording lacks a song with the same musical impact as just about anything on the previous record, and is also missing ""Peace Be Still""'s swinging percussion.This isn't a bad record, but it's not a great one either."
5,Exellent,Este libro es una gran ayuda para las personas que no entienden el significado de algunos terminos biblicos lo recomiendo ampliamente
1,Not relevant for today,"This might have been a good book in 2003...but not today. If you are planning on rolling your own media center, you will definitely need as current a reference book as possible!"
5,If you were wondering why talking with someone of a different race might be uncomfortable,"I thought that the Doctor might have something interesting to say so I picked up a copy of ""The Race Trap"".He described how we're each most comfortable being around people who are similar to us. He gives us a questionnaire about our natural responses when you find yourself in a situation that you are uncomfortable with.Then after we recognize how some preconceptions may drive us to saying things like ""you people"" or ""those people"", he challenges us to think about better ways of considering the individuals and walking a mile in their shoes.Thanks to the authors. I enjoyed the new thoughts that I was exposed to."
3,Stiff-necked,"My teacher recommended this book as The Book To Read if I wanted to read a book about Alexander Technique as I was taking lessons. Obviously it's a book that works wonderfully for many people. I was disappointed, though. I found the book rigid and very dismissive of approaches the author didn't absolutely agree with, and obsessed with bolstering itself with citations and quotes. It almost deifies Alexander, and talks very specifically of positions etc. The impression I have of Alexander Technique from my lessons is completely different: it's about being open rather than closed to alternatives.And yes, I had heard that Alexander lessons are infinitely better than books. I absolutely agree after reading this."
1,Garbage,"With its awkward user interface and the manufacturer's repeated attempts to sell me more software when I'd use the product, this was never my favorite piece of software. Nevertheless, I decided to continue to use it after moving to a new location and changing my email address. From that point on the program refused to update the list of viruses it'd check for. Even after a two-hour Internet chat with three of their technicans, the problem went unresolved. What was a poor product from the start became an esentially useless product."
2,Stupid,"This program is stupid. It makes you download 5 things before you can update your definitions, along with registering. You have you remember your email and password just to update! McAfee has this stupid securitycenter... Just buy Norton. You'll smile."
2,Never Delivered,"I ordered this framer around the 20th of October 2003, expecting a little bit of a wait on delivery. However here it is November 7th and I was told it might be in around December 1st. Amazon / tool crib get your delivery system fixed."
4,bay leaf plant,I really like the plant. I've looked around for a long time for this herb. It is small but it is growing. Can't wait for Spring/Summer when I can put it on the deck in a larger pot.
5,Bay Leaf plant,"This little plant came in a relatively short time in excellent condition. I love to cook, but when a recipe calls for bay leaves I sincerely doubt the value of those dried leaves which seem to add nothing to the dish. With a fresh bay leaf plant I am now looking forward to truly experiencing these culinary gems."
2,Does not stick to tub,"I've used this pillow for a week now, and it is very frustrating because the pillow will not stick to the tub. Either the suction cups do not work, or the sunction cups detach from the pillow. Who makes a bath pillow with detachable sunction cups? What is the point?"
4,A Classic Descriptive Depiction of Janis Jolpin.,"I needed to write a book review on a biography for a school paper and being a major fan of Joplin, I chose this book. I was astounded to find that it WASN'T some regular old blah-blah-blah-she-did-this-she-did-that kind of book... it was actually extremely interesting! I couldn't put it down! READ IT!"
5,"Joplin ressurects in Friedman's ""Buried Alive.""","One of the best biographys on the market, ""Buried alive"" is a mut read! Any fan would agree that Friedman has done Joplin more than justice. An emotional rollercoaster ride as elaborate as the ride Joplin rode herself. To tell the absolute truth, I cried at the end and I obviously knew what was going to happen before I even picked the book up!"
4,"Very real, very personal story of Janis' life","I believe very few people ever saw the ""real"" Janis Joplin, however Myra Friedman did, and she wrote an excellent biography. Janis may have come across as a real tough chick, but inside she was a frightened child, and Myra saw that. (I personally believe that Janis had Borderline Personality Disorder.) I read this book back in high school around 1975 and just re-read it. I had to get it from the library, since it is out of print. It may be hard to find, but it is worth the effort."
1,"the book seems ""ghost-written and not by Janis Joplin.","though filled with many important facts about Joplin's life and career and some good b&w photos, Myra Friedman seems to have had the help of a ghost-writer and the ghost was not Joplin, who has probably been rolling over in her grave since the book was first published in 1973. Too much speculation on the author's part, who ruins the book with so much unnecessary b.s. at times that it is not a smooth read. Granted, Joplin's life was a roller coaster ride, but she had more control over it than Friedman did with her biography. It needs to be edited and her attempts at psychoanalysis eliminated. A shame because Friedman appears (on the surface) to have known her subject somewhat well."
1,THIS BOOK IS NOT WORTH THE READ!,"I'm not sure what is going on with this book, but I think it is TERRIBLE! The author, while claiming to be a friend and associate of Ms. Joplin's, perpetuates a mood of haughty disdain for the books main character! At times, it seems that the author is almost mocking Janis and the illness of her drug and alcohol dependence. This does not jive with the author's supposed ""relationship"" with Janis! ""With friends like these........"" (You know the rest!) Aside from the lack of compassion (or maybe a helping hand?) for Janis' deplorably sick condition, the book is a collection of disjointed, run-on sentences, improper grammer, and incorrect punctuation. Buy ""Pearl"" - it's much better than this biased, cold, poorly written trash. Peace, Jon"
4,Historically Important But Shrill,"That Myra Friedman was able to publish a biography of Joplin which is so poetic, so intense, and so engaging a mere three years after Joplin's tragic death is nothing short of miraculous. However, in the context of two other superlative Joplin biographies--LOVE, JANIS by Laura Joplin (Janis's younger sister)(1992) and SCARS OF SWEET PARADISE by Alice Echols (1999)--I find Friedman's compulsive rationalizing and anxious tone here (especially in the book's concluding section) to be less illuminating of the REAL Janis Joplin than the other two books. If you read only one Joplin bio, read LOVE, JANIS; if only two, add SCARS...; but if you are a die-hard Joplin fan (as I am), read all three. Taken together, it is a tribute to Janis herself that three stunningly intelligent, articulate writers could be moved to so obsess over Joplin's work and life that they produced biographies of such high caliber within thirty years of her death."
1,This book stinks,"Pleeze, Rolling Stone and other worshippers of this dribble. Myra Friedman spends most of this outing psychoanalyzing Janis Joplin with the pompous arrogance of someone who fancies herself a shrink. This cold, biased analysis of Janis leaves her faceless, lifeless and one-dimensional. Painting Janis to be a pathetic, ridiculous coward throughout, the author makes several laughable attempts to portray herself as a close friend, claiming to have loved Janis. With friends like this, who needs enemies? I can't imagine Janis feeling anything but betrayed and offended by this judgmental portrait. Janis deserved better than this. Unfortunately, it's been hailed as the definitive rock biography. It is nothing of the sort. If you want to know the real Janis, listen to her albums."
4,Olympus works 4/3 adapter ring works great.,Fits well and connects your OM lens to the 4/3 body. Product is as described and much less of an investment when compared to the brand name product.
1,E for effort,"I bought this hoping that it would be better than others but was greatly disappointed. I understand it is a pocket dictionary but where are all the words to make up a dictionary?Remarkable, significant, moment, miracle, etc....I am so disappointed with this and will be returning it for refund."
3,Limited Translation,"While this dictionary was some help, I guess what I really needed was a resource where I could look up phrases. I can see how it would be helpful to people traveling, but not so much for a literature teacher teaching a book with Igbo words in it."
2,alright,"My folks are from Anambra State...Awka to be exact. This reference is just okay. The lack of accurate/efficient Igbo language learning tools is frustrating. None of my home dialect is really reflected in this dictionary...nor are many others. It's nice to look through, however, you won't be teaching your children or yourself much in the way of meaningful conversation."
4,The game continues,"Dr. Lionel Barrett's paranormal investigative team has settled into ""Hell House"" and the house is beginning to settle into them. Florence Tanner insists that she made contact with the deceased son of Emeric Belasco, but Barrett finds the idea a difficult one to grasp. Edith Barrett is beginning to feel uneasy desires and is also starting to sleepwalk. Benjamin Fischer knows better than to trust the house, having survived its previous attempt to kill him, and only helps the others as long as it is safe to do so. This second volume of the sequential art adaptation of Richard Matheson's classic ghost story Hell House is a nice balance of graphic chills and gradually mounting tension. Recommended."
5,An eye-opening step into what was happening during the American invasion of Iraq,"It's an eye-opening step into what was happening during the American invasion of Iraq in March 2003. Told from the point of view of Arab television network Al Jazeera, the documentary follows Al Jazeera employees and covers time spent in the US Central Command briefing room in Doha, Qatar. It explores the media's role in modern war.The only American featured prominently in the documentary - Marine Corps media liaison officer John Rushing - later becomes a Washington, D.C.-based correspondent for Al Jazeera International (check out his YouTube channel). After I saw the documentary, I read Mission: Al Jazeera (2007) by Josh Rushing; he resigned from the Marines after he was forbidden to speak about the documentary with the press."
4,"Very informative, and explains a lot about Propaganda","I found this movie to be very informative, and US citizens should watch this because most are unaware of how media works. I've studied Journalism, so I was very interested in this film.Recently, while listening to NPR, I discovered that one of the main individuals featured in this documentary, Josh Rushing, has now joined the English Al Jazeera network.If you want to understand the news media, Propaganda, and the US situation in Iraq this documentary is a good resource. Very interesting."
4,Great Documentary,"Before watching this movie I must admit I had some stark views of Al Jazeera, but this movie completely changed that for me. It seems this Arab station was asking when no American station would: what evidence is there of WMDs or links with al Qaeda does Iraq have and what motives does the U.S. have for ""intervening?"" The most upsetting thing taken from the documentary was how the U.S. media congregated in CentCom, waiting to be given, probably filtered, government and military press releases - our news stations were waiting to be given the news.This is a great documentary which will probably pick up viewership as time goes on."
4,Not everyone is supporting the lies...,"Americans should watch this film, to get information to form a real ""fair and balanced"" view of the debacle in Iraq. Of course Al-Jazeera is biased, but so what. I found this film to be very interesting and informative because it gives me a view of my country from a fresh perspective.Neocon minions will, of course, not like this documentary; calling people ""unpatriotic"" and whining about ""all the lies"". They only want you to have one view of this new Vietnam. Watch this for yourself and form your own opinion."
2,Believed it until I saw the interview with Saddam's sons.,"I too thought this was a good video, nice to see that some media were above stuff. Really thought it was incredible watching when America rolled into Baghdad adn though also from the reactions and comments that something was up. Now we know why. In a released video, the guy running the show over there in Al-Jazeera is shown talking to Saddam's son ( A vile man) and telling him not to worry that Al-Jazeera is their network (Saddam's). This video has lost all credibility for me, just like Michael Moore's F911. Both are lies sold for mass consumption to people that want to believe that America is wrong and evil."
2,Lacking insight,"With all the gushing reviews I've read here and eleswhere, I was expecting Control Room to be one of the best documentaries ever. As you've probably guessed, I didn't like it all that much. I found it rather blah, linear and uninspired. It wasn't awful, but it just wasn't anything I hadn't seen, read or known about the Iraqi war (and I'm a Canadian who generally stays away from television). Especially now that the war is long since concluded, it's not something I want to spend alot of time thinking about. But hey, I love documentaries and this one is highly rated, so I gave it a chance. Now I wish I could have that hour or so back."
