4,Brady Bunch movies.,I enjoyed both movies and they played with errors or skips.I would recommend it for purchase if you like the fun that will insue.Kevin.
3,Fun Serial with Lugosi. Typical early Alpha Quality,"Fun Serial with Bela Lugosi at his evil best as Dr Zorka. Alpha has broken this 12 chapter serial into 2 separate DVD's for sale. This disk contains chapters 1-6. When I first starting watching this disk, I cringed during Chapter 1 as the quality was quite poor with lots of scrathes and some splicing. I thought, ""Here we go again with a substandard Alpha release!"" Then, to my surprise, chapters 2-5 were quite good. Still nothing like you would get from the Roan Group, but on par with Sinister Cinema or Retro Media. Chapter 6 falls in closer to the poor quality of chapter 1, however.If you are a Lugosi fan and want a low cost version of this series, then take a chance on the Alpha release. If you are a Lugosi fan who wants to collect the best possible prints of his films, then skip this Alpha release. The disk contains no extras, but does have a chapter stops for each serial chapter."
1,the phantom,There is nothing good I can tell you about this DVD so I'II skip the review and tell you whats wrong with it. The DVD has no menus or sound on most of the episodes and the video quality is horrible.The Phantom Creeps released by Reel Classis Films is not a pressed DVD as you would expect from a distributer but a copy and when I played the DVD I could hear the player having a hard time trying to play it. So if your thinking of purchasing this DVD or any other movie from REEL CLASSIC FILMS dont. I threw mine in the recycle bin.
1,Last Page ruins it.,The last page ruins the book - The girl says that she doesn't like camping on the last page! UGH!!!!
1,"Great, but not so great","While this phone is very clear, and stays charged for quite a long time, I have had nothing but problems with it. For starters, when putting it back on the charger it does not always charge. You have to fiddle with it so it sits in the charger just right. The phone also gets very hot after sitting on the charger, and the numbers tend to stick. This is the second one we have purchased, figuring maybe the first one was just a defect."
2,Not worth the cost,"Wanting to try something new, I picked up this little spritz. I was looking for an engergizing 'pick-me-up' that I could use in the middle of the day. I won't purchase this item again. After regular use, I did not find any difference in my skin (normal-oily, make-up free), did not experience any engergizing feeling, and quickly discovered that this product tastes terrible. The directions state to 'close your eyes and spray 10cm from you face' but this method lands the product on your lips - that would be how I discovered the awful taste.The one redeeming value I have for this product is the scent; I'm a huge fan of citrus based scents. But that benefit does not justify the cost of this product."
2,erm....it has a nice smell?,"Like the other reviewers, I agree completely. This was a waste of my money (I bought mine in UK for 9 and was excpecting for it to do everything it says it should) I went travelling and needed a pick up during my flights. All this felt like was a spritz and a basic nice citrus smell. Nothing less and definately nothing more. You'd be better off putting water and a squeeze of orange/lemon juice in an empty bottle and spritzing your face...I know that's even better than this overpriced THING."
2,Sticky,"This spray had a sticky feel that I didn't like. The citrusy smell was nice, but I didn't like the way it felt on my skin"
3,I liked it..not 16 dollars worth though.,"I'd buy this again if it wasn't for the price. The smell is GREAT. I don't know if it energizes me but it does make me feel a bit more calm. I don't notice any real benefit from the vitamin C and my skin feels a little sticky afterwards. It makes my face feel nice and cool and I have it sitting next to me for little ""refresher sprays"" during the day. I'd pay 8-9 dollars for this..however I won't be buying it again for 16 dollars."
5,A great Live CD,"I don't know how much studio polish was added after the fact, but this CD sounds like the concert I went to. A brilliant selection of songs...was hoping for newewr stuff but you get it all in this set."
5,The Sun Still Shines,"This new live Dokken CD is fantastic and I definitely recommend it to all Dokken fans. Reb Beach holds his own; George is barely missed. Don's vocals are mature but he still sounds great. They really have it together on this one. They enjoy making music and playing live, and this CD is a pure reflection of that."
2,the same songs on each compilation.,"I think that the sound and editing of this cd has a very acceptable quality but, unfortunately, the tracks contained on it are quite dissapointing. I would have liked a lot better other material not included on the greatest hits collection and on the beast from the east album. Erase the slate and maddest hatter are ok. but what about ""change the world"" maybe?. My personal choice would have been in this order: erase the slate, change the world, kiss of death, inside looking out, paris is burning, here i stand (from the absent shadowlife), what price, tooth and nail, down in flames (from dons solo work), in my dreams, maddest hatter, unchain the night and breaking the chains. I think that half of the tracks could have been much better."
2,Not thrilled,"As a Dokken fan going back to Breaking the Chains, it's sad to see and hear that ol' Don isn't holding it together as well as he once did. The vocals on this CD are extremely weak, even the stuff off of Erase the Slate that was written to be more easily singable. Reb Beach is a blistering guitar player and Wild Mick and Jeff Pilson are as strong a rhythm section as ever, but I can't get past the vocal issue. My advice: go see them live, enjoy the still-excellent live show, and treasure the memories. This CD will only tarnish them."
1,Why bother?,"Is Dokken really this desperate to come out with a new CD? If you really want to hear what Dokken sounds like live, go pick up Beast From the East or even One Live Night. I'd say go see them in concert, but without George there's no point. Reb Beach is a great guitar player, but he's no George Lynch. And Reb is the first one to admit it! I've already heard him butcher classic Dokken tunes in concert. Why would I now want to buy the CD? If Dokken is truly serious about carrying on without George then they should definitely look into replacing Beach with John Norum or some other guitarist that can handle the material."
3,a reviewer from massachusetts,"it's nice to see dokken's still around this live cd will fair well with the live vai,and satriani cd's also releaed this year.thee seems to be a new resugance of metal coming now wth bands like sum41,linkin park,etc.ive heard that reb beach has left to return to winger.but all hope isn't lost there are still plenty of guitarists out there that could play as good as him then,and now. you know about america's vai,satch,etc.or swedens yngwie or andy laorque.but germany's premier guitar wizzard mathias dieth,from udo would have filled lynches shoes perfectly.of the four releases hismost prominant playing on mean machine,faceless world,and time bomb.or bruce kulick,from kiss especially on asylum,and crazy nights.idont know who dokken will pick or even if he will make another cd,but i hope he sticks around,and i look forward to what the future release will be..."
2,a reviewer from massachusetts,"this was awfull;what a racket.someone should tell don dokken it's not the 70's,and reb beach it's not the old west.""'""at least george had a hairstyle and a guitar style.''i thought don would replace george with a guitar player like kee marcello,of europe,who can play as good or even beter than vai,lynch,malmsteen,or eddie v.or wolf hoffmann,or even john norum,(also of europe)this music is from the 80's,it's what we listened to to rebel;you cant dance to it and the lyrics are deressing.records are gone ,the berlin walls gone ,and so is alot of our eardrums,(from mick browns headache inducing pounding on every song) don;make one last 5 star record with a different drummer,and one of these guitarists,and then''please!''let it die gracefully then we can all have a little peace,and wont have to listen to anymore plays on your nice last name"
3,Still shining.,"The new incarnation of Dokken with Reb Beach does justice to older material and manages to shine through their newer songs.It is a quite decent album with Don's vey soulful and competent vocals,however one still misses George Lynch's ferocious attack:Reb Beach is a great player in his own right,yet his highly polished style lends the older songs an unwanted touch of pop...As far as the production is concerned this is one of the better sounding live albums I've heard.Die-hard fans will grab it for sure,while newer fans may want to start with their unbelievable 1988 live,'Beast from the East'."
5,SIMPLY AWESOME!,"Just picked it up today and I wasn't dissapointed. These boys know how to rock and prove it on this CD...this is how true live rock is to sound! You have got to hear the version of ""Too High To Fly"" on this...."
4,Quality Quick,The third in the Lavinia Lake/Tobias March series has the two investigators searching for a mysterious murderer. The murderer dispatches fiances who would make unsatisfactory husbands for young girls. Lavinia and Tobias are joined by her neice and his brother-in-law to solve an interesting and exciting mystery. The first two of the series were a disappointment but this story is almost back to Amanda Quick's earlier historical romances. Characterization is sharp and the twists of the plot keep the reader guessing to the end. An enjoyable read for the summer and the beach.
1,Really Didn't Like it,"I've read Ms. Quick before (have almost all of her books)and this book is not up to her standards. The characters are annoying and dull. Lavinia, the lead female character, comes off as almost desperate and Tobias is arrogant and officious---I really disliked him.If you're interested in some great Amanda Quick novels, try ""Surrender"" or ""Reckless"" or ""Scandal"" or any other novel she wrote BEFORE she embarked on this detective series."
3,3 1/2 stars?,"Well.....I see that other Quick readers say they're disappointed. So, since I'm a Newbie, here goes:When a book is selling for .01 used, that's a Clue, isn't it?This was a page-turner for me; I liked the plot and the slight bit of titilation (sexual scenes written); for some of us, it's a bit unusual for women of that era to be so specific about their sexuality & what pleases them (added to value, for me anyway).I also appreciated the last-minute twists that her plot offered (is that a TradeMark of hers?).I can't compare/contrast this to other Quick Books (pun?), so I'll leave it as above; if my time was otherwise taken, I might not have appreciated this as I did."
4,"Great Job, Rob!","I ordered this video after hearing much about it... and buying it was absolutely worth it. From learning such difficult lead guitar parts such as ""And Your Bird Can Sing"" and ""Till There Was You"", to developing the tricky finger-picking patterns in ""Dear Prudence"", ""Julia"", and ""Her Majesty"", this video has helped me vastly improve my guitar playing. A must have!!!"
5,GREAT SURFING MUSIC OF THE 60'S,THE DRUMMING IN THESE SONGS IS WELL WORTH THE BUYING OF THE CD EVEN IF YOU WERE BORN IN OR AFTER THE 60'S.THIS IS THE MUSIC THAT ONE UEED TO DANCE TO AND REALLY ENJOY AND WIPEOUT IS CLAASIC THAT WILL LIVE FOREVER.DEFINITELY BUY THIS ONE AND SOME OF THE BEACH BOYS SURFING AND HOT RODDING ALBUMS
4,Hella HLA-003001791: 12V Dual-Tone Air Horn,"Hella HLA-003001791: 12V Dual-Tone Air HornIt puts a smile on my face every time I press the button. This is probably my fourth air horn (previously Fiamm). I love them. Women don't seem to get it though.Pros: Fairly easy installation (once you figure out location)Compact compressorNice sharp sound & response (consistent so far)Worked with my existing horn relayCons: Nuts and bolts only, no mounting brackets for trumpets (I had to fabricate a bracket)"
5,Great buy,"With a Merv 12 rating, these are terrific filters for your home. Using these filters in addition to a vacuum with HEPA filter, has really improved the air quality in our home and visibly reduced dust.The filters were well packaged and arrived soon after ordering. You'd be hard pressed to find a better deal for filters of this quality. They're worth the money."
2,"Great idea, poor execution","OK, so we all know that Mr. Powers is an eloquent and elegant writer, but it seems that this book is mostly about him lording it over the rest of us. Obviously, AI is a compelling subject - what makes humans human? But unfortunately, the human characters in the book are shallow, unlikable, and not particularly human. And really, why is the Protagonist also named Richard Powers? Is this suppose to be autobiographical? I don't enjoy the whinings of the mid-life crisis set."
3,unengaging and strained,"A friend recommended one of Power's novels just as the New York Times piece about him came out, and I was intrigued: another ""cerebral"" writer, à la Calvino, Borges, Nabokov? I've also been tremendously interested in AI--but the novel was disappointing: the actual writing is strained and even pretentious at times, while the narrative never becomes engaging. He works with big, interesting ideas, but they don't seem to result in big (or even small) interesting novels."
3,A mixed bag.,"The self-recursive meditations on consciousness are entertaining and enlightening, and Powers' use of language is simple, evocative, and strong. However, the plot drags until near the end when everything you've been waiting for happens at once. And let's not forget the cathartic-for-him, depressing-for-us relationship side issue which seemingly has nothing to do with the story but still eats away chapters. I recommend this book to aspiring writers, both to see how genius your fiction could be when you cut through the B.S. of language, and also as a warning that you can't just air out your personal laundry in print and expect it to work within the plot. A work of contrasts. However, his descriptions of Dutch family life almost makes the relationship stuff worth it. Almost."
2,"Wonderful, even if a bit too much at times","Why a 2? Because I felt that Powers spent waaay too much time on his past relationship with C. While it had relevance to the story, he could have gotten the gist across in fewer, shorter flashbacks. It seemed like so much filler. I did love, however, the take on Pygmalion. The parralells and other allusions made it a wonderful story. But brush up on your cognitive and physiological psychology before you attempt to tackle this book! A lot of big concepts and words get thrown around in the process of creating Helen. I admire the author for his extensive research on the subjects. Makes this old psych major pround! :)"
4,An instant classic,"The writing is brilliant, with an extremely high vocabulary and a keen use of metaphor (Powers' standard). The science is suspect but is intelligently focused more by his expertise in literary devices and the logic of langauge (or lack of) than by knowledge of neural networks and computers (of which, even still, he knows a lot). The love story is fairly unmoving to me, and is annoying at times, though perhaps it is more realistic in that way. The ending is stunning.You've never read anything quite like it, and may never again, so it is worth a try. It was the first Powers book I managed to get all the way through, and it revived the bookworm in me that was dormant for years. He has a knack for witty dialogue (though every character is so sharp (even a young child) it's hard to believe they are not of the same mind), and descriptions of the world that would never have occurred to you. You will be smarter after reading this. I love my friend for passing it on to me."
3,for computer scientists with nougat and nuts (short version),"SHORT VERSION: Galatea 2.2 is (in essence) Richard Powers' novelization of the ideas laid out in Douglas Hofstadter's Godel, Escher, Bach. It's well-crafted (if a bit pretentious with the language at times) and (with no small irony) a bit recursive. It's also tragically humanist. I was half-blind with cross-eyed, hopeful denials of determinism toward the end there; or perhaps I'm thinking of naive humanitarianism? Helen's cynical abandonment (a cognitive suicide) was not anticipated but neither was it surprising. The odd moment of recognition? Suddenly I was once again in the final moments of Ian McDonald's River of Gods, cradling Aj's dying body, suffering the same disappointments.I closed this book feeling indicted."
2,"Good modern fiction, poor science fiction","I'm an avid reader of science fiction, and I have a professional interest in anything pertaining to artificial intelligence. Accordingly, I was excited by the premise and promise of Galatea 2.2. It seemed likely that Richard Powers could explore this field in a thought-provoking, valuable, or interesting new way.Unfortunately not. This isn't really a book about Helen, or about AI. The whole concept of Helen exists only as a foil for the musings and life discoveries of the autobiographical protagonist; she could be replaced by a socially stunted colleague or disabled child and nearly none of the text would have to change.It may be worthwhile fiction, but if your interest is in the supposed topic rather than the author, look elsewhere."
4,A pleasurable struggle,"A sometimes difficult book, especially with all of the computer references that are included (which are not exactly my forte'). Still, it remains a very good book, for we get a good sense of the protagonist's being adrift in a new life. It is interesting how he tries to find some handhold on his world while mixed in with people who very nearly speak a whole other language than himself. I am always attracted to characters who are spiritually wounded, yet manage to summon the courage to continue on with their lives, as well as to tackle daunting tasks. However, this isn't one of those books that will leave you happy and fuzzy after the last page. Those of you who swear by a certain talk show host's club's selections may want to avoid this one. But, if you like giving your brain cells a bit of a workout, this work is definitely a good choice."
3,Dense and Demanding,"If you want to work hard, wade through this dense book. I wasn't convinced the payoff was enough to justify the effort. It took me a long time to read this book - stretching it over 6 months may have harmed my comprehension skills. But I think if you have the time and the inclination, the book could be rewarding."
1,good day,Well I was quite dissapointed with this. I tried some of these techniques and and my arm got smaller by two inches. I felt tired and iratable and couldn't stop passing wind all day due to the compression factor of the excercises outlined in the book. Apart from that there is a good overview on bbulk building techniques. There was one strange side affect that ocured of my faeces turning blue.
2,yeaahhh...,Blast from the past.....man they could of moved around a bit....pretty straight kinda style.....for funkie sounds.......loved it for the memories....Eps.....
2,POOR SOUND QUALITY AND VIDEO IS ALSO POOR,A REAL TRIP DOWN MEMORY LANE!!! IT's A REAL SHAME THAT THE SOUND AND VIDEO QUALITY IS SO POOR ON THIS DVD BUT I GUESS IT WAS 1972 !!!
5,Dead World rules!!!,"If you've never heard of them before, your not alone. I didn't know about them till watching the Traces Of Death movies, and they're worth your money if your into Death Metal."
1,NOT medicine. You're paying for water! Ridiculous!,"I bought this before I knew what ""homeopathy"" was. It had no effect on my dog at all. I've since learned what the 5x means on the side of the bottle. In homeopathy the ""x"" is the number of times the ingredient has been diluted with 100 parts water. In other words, this means it contains absolutely no trace of the ""active ingredient"".Call it whatever you want: woo, hogwash, baloney, just don't call it a remedy. Please research what homeopathy is before you waste your money on stuff like this. James Randi has an excellent, and funny, video on you tube. I recommend you watch it."
2,Questionable,I haven't seen any difference using this and I don't think.it does what it claims. I wouldn't buy it again
4,Good Job!,I think this product has improved my anxiety some. I usually put it in a 1/2 glass of water and just sit back and relax. I would recommend it to others. It sure can't hurt.
1,Not very good,Did not do what it said it would! Disappointed! Wouldn't recommend to anyone! Waste of money. Couldn't even tell I took it.
5,rescue remedy,"I have been using this product for years, because at times, I become anxious and do not want to use anything other than herbal. Large crowds can cause me to hyperventilate, but I don't want to give up going to concerts, festivals, etc. A few drops of this under the tongue relaxes me enough to get past the anxiousness."
2,Didn't Notice A Defference,Didn't work for me.I know people who swear by it though.Everyone is different.What did work for me is Natural Calm Magnesium.
4,It Works!! AA++ I Recommend!!,"This is a great remedy on the go or at home, basically anywhere you feel stress or an anxiety it helps you relax andcalms the nerves and if didn't work the first time you can always take some more drops and it should help and it won't do no harm.All Thanks to a Great Friend that Recommend me this Remedy!"
1,Didn't work for me,"I experience anxiety at times and a general feeling of edginess. I was hoping this might be of help after reading many of the reviews here. I found no benefit whatsoever. I even doubled the dosage and no effect. Tried it before sleep as well, but no difference. Breathing techniques I find to be much more beneficial to bring a sense of calm on."
2,Didn't think it would work. Maybe that's why it didn't,"We bought this on the recommendation of a local groomer as a way to relax our long haired cat who doesn't like brushing. Our cat took it without much problem, but he started running around like crazy. He fought the brushing process with his usual ""stop pulling my hair or I'll bite you"" demeanor. So, it didn't hardly relax or ""rescue"" anybody. I noticed before we purchased it that the main ingredient is alcohol, so I suggested to the missus that we skip buying this product and spend a few dollars more to just get a bottle of Jack Daniels. At least that way, I could have been relaxed if my cat wasn't. The missus was afraid I wouldn't give the cat the right ""dose"" of Tennessee medicine, and she really wanted to give Bach's a try. It just didn't work. So now we're stuck with an expensive medicine dropper in a tiny bottle of homeopathic booze. My wife's disappointed and frustrated. My cat's tangled and matted. I'm dry and sober. Sigh."
4,Works for me,The results are very mild but it definitely works. I usually double the recommended dosage of 4 drops to 8. Definitely help calm me. I use it as a sleep aid too.
2,OH Well!,I have no comment. I see nothing valuable in this product. It just does not seem to do as they claim. I see alot of that. Maybe it's just me!
4,Rescue Remedy,"I got the idea to try this after reading Cecile Lamalle's books with Charley Poisson's French chef character. Charley always pops a few drops of this on his tongue when confronted with a stressful situation - when I saw it in a health food store in New Hampshire I thought ""Why not try it, I'm stressed a lot these days?"" Well, I won't say it totally took away my stress, but I've gone through several bottles now, and whether it really works or just makes me think it's doing something (the mind is a wonderful thing) - I usually do feel more able to deal with harsh situations after I've had a few drops. It does have alcohol in it, but I don't see how that could be a problem, considering you only use a few drops."
4,"If it works for me, it works!","Ok, you are reading a testimonial from someone who has been on Paxil, Prozac, Desyrel, Ambien, pretty much most of the inventory of Walgreens. I heard about a ""flower remedy"" and reacted with a LOL and a ""you cannot be serious"" sarcastic remark. I tried it, and well it worked a little. I figured I would try a few more drops that what they instructed...and it does work! It is totally safe from what i have read to increase to six to eight drops....which is definitely works for me! Wait about fifteen to twenty minutes and your panic or stressful situation will decrease!"
5,Rescue Remedy Rocks!!,"My therapist recommended this to me to help combat chronic sleeplessness. I have never gone in much for homeopathic remedies, but I can tell you that this works!! I put 4 drops in my evening tea and I am snoozing within a couple hours. I have also noticed an increase in my dream activity too. Don't use this product unless you want a good night's sleep!!"
1,Total crap,"I bought this because a local vet recommended it for keeping my cat from freaking out and voiding itself everywhere on an upcoming car trip. I wish I'd read the label before purchasing it, because it's a homeopathic treatment. If you don't know what that is, the idea behind it is that water has ""memory"" and the more you dilute something, the stronger it magically becomes. If you don't understand my scorn because you have friends who swear by homeopathy, try diluting Kook-Aid twenty or thirty times and then tell me how much sweeter it becomes!Long story short, I got to listen to my cat howl for three hours while she peed and pooped all over the carrier. Of course, maybe I broke the homeopathy somehow, since I gave her twice the recommended dose."
4,Rescue Remedy,"I bought this product at the recommendation of our vet to reduce my dogs anxiety. So far, I haven't seen a big change, but I believe I will after time. If you need relief from stress and anxiety, I would recommend this product."
1,Pretty expensive way to buy brandy.,"In a Google search for Bach Rescue Remedy shows there is no evidence that Bach Rescue Remedy is any more effective than a placebo:""Flower remedies"": a systematic review of the clinical evidence."" (Wien KlinWochenschr. 2002 Dec 30;114(23-24):963-6.).Your money is better spent elsewhere.Bach Rescue Remedy is a 5X dilution, which is 1/100,000 dilution.You are buying a solution that is 99.999% brandy. In the 10ML size, you are buying about .00001 ML of cure and 9.99999 ML of brandy. Each 4 drop dose is made up of about 0.000000266666666666667 ML (0.0000000933333333333333 ounces) of the remedy. ( Which assumes 15 drops per ML ).Even if you double these numbers for a 20ML bottle, it's no bargain.You'd be better off spending the purchase price on a bottle of brandy or a pound of gourmet chocolate -- whichever you find more relaxing"
1,Overpriced and not worth it,I bought this hoping it would be the miracle cure all the other reviewers report it to be but it was not. Don't waste you money like i did.If you are looking for something like this to calm or energize you try different fragrances of essential oils. You put them on your neck and enjoy the aroma for a couple of hours then reapply as needed. If you are looking for a skin tonic try Absorbine Jr it comes in a shampoo. Also don't forget about rubbing alcohol.
1,Not sure if it works and not sure why called value pack,I thought value pack meant two bottles but only one was inside the box.I don't know if this works or not. It's 42% alcohol. I think that would be enough to calm anyone down but you'd have to take the entire bottle. I don't think it works.
2,Oops-a-daisy!,"I ordered this product for my Hedgehog, as suggested by several knowledgeable Hedgehog owners. It was supposed to calm him down and make him less anxious.While he calmed down a little bit, he also stopped running, which he normally does all night, and became lethargic. I'm aware that this product probably isn't intended for animals . . .But one thing that all of these reviews failed to mention was that the small bottle you order contains 20% alcohol. So you're pretty much paying a ridiculously high price for 8 oz, when you could go get a bottle or Bacardi for much less."
3,Thoughts on rescue remedy,"It didn't appear to help calm at all, did not notice any change, even increased the amount that was recommended"
2,Didn't seem to do much for me,Tried this product because Dr. Oz recommended it but it didn't seem to do much for me. Only used it a couple of times but I didn't notice much difference.
2,DIDN'T WORK FOR MY DOG,"This product did not seem to have any effect at calming down my new retired greyhound. I put it directly on treats at several intervals throughout the day (maybe 3 hours apart) and noticed absolutely no change in her nervous behavior. A ""KONG"" filled up with treatas and then frozen worked better."
5,It works!,"Rescue Remedy is homeopathic and therefore contains highly diluted amounts of the active ingredients, so I was initially skeptical that it would do anything for me. Yet after picking this up at my local health food store I can assure you that it actually works! I now take some of the essences separately and have been amazed by how well they work. I'm excited to see this product get more exposure as people are finding that it works well with pets also!"
3,I don't notice anything from this product.,"It's a popular product but if anything happens in my body with this product, I don't notice it. Then again, I'm not a depressed person. I'm actually a pretty relaxed person as it is. I've used it about 20 times as recommended."
2,dog calming juice=4 of 10,"product seems effective at times, other times totally ineffective. In any case I would rate it's success as marginal. perhaps a 3 or4 on a scale of 10. For the price I would not repurchase the product..."
3,just ordered but i felt like writing,"so i took my roadtest about 2 weeks ago and failed bc i was so jacked up with nerves so bad i couldnt even remember what i was doing it was bad so i wanted to get something that would help me without the harmful side effects so i can take my roadtest atempt number 2 without the nerves and anxiety. im going to try this before my roadtest to see how it effects me and then use it on the day of, i will update"
1,do not give to pets,"Do not use the human version on your pets as it really burns. It burned my digestive tract and stomach after two uses. Really painful. Use the pet version without alcohol on your pets so it doesn't burn them. My dog used to fight it and I realized that it was burning her. I tried it and it burned me. Now she and I both use the pet version and we gave the human version to my husband. My dog loves the pet version and she begs for it but will fight the human version ""tooth and nail"". Please believe me because the poor little things can't tell you that it is burning them."
2,save your money,"This is just watered down booze. Might as well save your money and take a shot of the real stuff. Plus, don't use this on your animals without researching first! many dogs/cats are allergic to herbs and giving an animal alcohol is never a good thing!"
2,"Alcohol, water and extremely diluted flower essences - didn't work for me","A friend recommended this product to me, and I ordered it without really reading a lot about it. When it arrived I read the label and realized the main ingredients are alcohol and water. Maybe this product does work for some people, or maybe it's the placebo effect I read about, but it did nothing for me except give me booze breath.Sorry, but this is one homeopathic remedy that doesn't contain enough of anything to be effective.I gave the bottle to the friend who recommended it."
5,Lifesaver,I have used this for four years for an all natural alternative to medicine for anxiety for my Golden Retriever
4,Rescue Remedy,Best price that we could find. Does seem to relax you and decrease stress and anxiety leverls. No bad or after taste.
3,dog reaction to rescue remedy.,will try again in a week or so. y dog is only hyper in a storm or with fire works.
5,Love it!! It works great!,"My husband and I are using these drops for 3 years now. They are amazing. We don't have chronic anxieties but once in a while when we are jittery and stressed out, this works wonders for both of us. I bought some for my whole family once I saw how great it works. The best part of it is that it does not make you groggy or have any noticeable side effects, just clear headed and calm. We really love it."
4,Works well,The human version of this product had much better reaction than the pet version. I started out with 4 drops in water and slept very well....almost too well! I've lowered it to 3 and it's great. It has a very strong floral taste - somewhat like tasting perfume - but I put it in one ounce of water and swallow it. The alcohol base is somewhat upsetting to my stomach at times.
4,Rescue Remedy,"A work colleague told me about this product -- she uses it for her cat. It's designed for humans but can be used in diluted form in pets. I have a cat who has become very nervous, constantly grooming to the point of pulling out some of her fur. It seemed to work.As it happens, I take medication that sometimes makes me jittery and uncomfortably tremulous, so I tried Rescue Remedy, and it seems to reduce the hand tremors that sometimes occur as a side effect to the medication."
1,Not for me,"I hate to give a bad review to this because it sounded like a wonderful product and seems to have worked for some others. Unfortunately, I cannot tell a difference from taking this product. I am disappointed (aside from the wasted money) since I long to find a ""natural"" anxiety reliever."
2,Didn't notice much of a difference.,"I didn't notice much of a difference when I used this. I used it on a number of occassions (4 drops under the toungue) and it didn't really affect my nerves. Looking at the ingredients, it contains 27% alcohol along with all the other natural stuff so I wasn't sure how much of the herbs were working vs. the alcohol. I wouldn't disregard it as a possible solution, but for folks with true anxiety issues, I don't see this as a viable solution."
2,eh,Didn't work for me - but everyones different. I always give something a fair shot - this one just didn't seem to help. Good luck for the rest of you.
5,Surprisingly effective,"I didn't think it would work at first but I was amazed. It's magnificent. I have an extremely high stress job and would have been wearing a straight jacket long ago without this product. Many of my friends and family are now also regular users of this product. Even my brother who didn't know what I was giving him or why the first time. (he trusts me and helps me test things like this a lot. You can never be sure it works until you take the placebo effect out of the equation right?) I also use it for my dog who has seizures. It has reduced her ""down time"" by more than half. I recommend Rescue Remedy often and adamantly."
5,Awesome!,"I never write product reviews, EVER! So taking the time to write this is a big deal. I suffer from mild to severe anxiety, physical side effects include heart palpitations, teeth clenching, and a general feeling of unease. 4 drops on the tounge as soon as I feel myself getting tense, and those feelings of dread just slide away, and I can focus on my job. This doesnt make you loopy or goofy either like prescription medication. Trust me, if you are looking for an all natural, safe, and inexpenasive way to relieve anxiety, you just found it!"
2,"Bad Formatting, Okay Content","1. The Kindle version of this book is just awful. Random bits of text from following chapters appear in the midst of unrelated previous chapters. Just terrible, hard to read, bad, bad, bad.2. As to the content itself - I can see this being useful if you have little to no experience with cats. A lot of this stuff should be basic common-sense stuff if you have cats, especially if you've adopted them from shelters or other rescue organizations. I took a look at this book because we've got a problem with ferals, strays and neighborhood wanderers in our yard and I was hoping for useful advice about telling them apart and what to do about them. But I already know what kinds of food are better or worse, I know how to take a cat to the vet and what kind of questions to ask the vet, how to give medicine to cats, all the stuff that she covers in-depth.If you're totally clueless about cats and decide to start rescuing them, this book may be for you, though."
5,Monkey loving!!,"My daughter laughs so hard at these.The only thing I do not care for and my daughter also is the breakup of shows.In the middle of each George, there is a little segment of real children doing what George learned in the last episode."
4,My son Loves Curious George,My 3 1/2 year old son loves to watch Curious George and there was no exception with this DVD. I love these shows because they are cute stories with great opportunities to learn.
1,"Waste of money, don't buy this brand. Buy Victor","I was at a home store the other day. They only carried the Tomcat brand snap traps. So I bought them.I usually buy ""Victor"". The first night I set the traps (three traps) the bait was completely eaten and the traps didn't snap. The second night I set them again and one out of three snapped and cought a rat. I use orange slices with the peeling attached, so it can't be carried off. The rats had to make plenty of movement to completely the orange and just leave the peeling behind. Bottom line, these traps suck. I have always used Victor traps with success. Tomcat brand traps are a complete waste oof money. Make the wise choice and buy Victor traps."
1,cheap device,"The basic design is classic, so I have no problem with that. I did catch one mouse. But both units failed in exactly the same way within days of purchase. The u-shaped pins which support the spring at the pivot popped out of the wooden base ... causing the spring to snap my finger, what's a little black and blue between friends? Don't waste your hard-earned money."
2,Not great but way better than their telephoto.,With the finepix s9000 you will clip your image if you are zoomed all the way out at 28mm. Some distortion but is very useful in a small room setting. Not bad for the price though. I'm hoping to have an image up soon.-peace
2,Silent Steel,"I'd bought this book hoping it would illuminate my understanding of the Scorpion tragedy. Instead, it presents a laundry list of problems that were common to many submarines of Scorpion's (Skipjack) class, and some that may have been somewhat more specific to Scorpion but were far too minor to have caused its sinking, even in combination.There is interesting information about the submarine and its crew, and I commend Mr. Johnson for his diligent citation of a host of public documents. But no real open-minded attempt was made to examine the cause of Scorpion's sinking, and the prose is plodding and repetitive.Points here for effort, but overwhelmingly poor marks for the author's numbingly dull style and failure to discuss and objectively analyze all possible information about the submarine.Silent Steel is a book that never moves from where it begins."
2,Silent Steel,"Too much detail, almost an analysis. i'm an avid fan of Submarine reads but this just didnt satisfy my inner desires. Well written however."
2,"Poorly-written journalism, definitely not naval science","This book contains 241 pages of disconnected, repetitive prose, of which about 100, at best, are informative and useful in understanding the loss of Scorpion. Are there no editors at publisher John Wiley & Sons, Inc.?"
4,Nice product,"the product function is good, nice sound, great features and value for money productPioneer AVH-P4900DVD In-Dash DVD Multimedia A/V Receiver With 6.5"" Display"
1,Radio Amazon,"Dear Sirs,the radio that I received, to be installed in a specialized center. default gives the CD can not leave. This defect causes needless expenses incurred.I really need to know that we can do and I'm disappointed with this purchase.Simply enter the CD is repriduce but not give out the hard drive.my emails are erickberto@hotmail.com"
2,Beware Indeed...,"Maybe I am naive but I had assumed these images were in a usable format. Instead, you have to export them, one by one, via a cumbersome 5-step process which is quite pointless and only serves to slow you down. This is not particularly useful to a designer. I just wanted some clip art. Now I see why they charge so little -- they cripple you!Also I concur that the images are not nearly as good a quality as Hemera would have you believe. All in all, though I love the quantity of images, the quality (and usability) is deeply lacking. Oh, and little would you guess, but if you want more than one computer to be able to use this library (i.e. over a network) you have to call them for a bulk license. Come on! That's what we designers use software like Portfolio for. Not the freeware-quality Hemera Clip Art Thing (tm).I had high hopes. Now I feel generous in offering two stars for any such products."
2,Hemera should not review its own software!!,"Let the customers decide for themselves without trying to skew the voting with a 5 rating from someone with a ""hemera.com"" email address. Amazon should delete that review. Does anyone know how to go about requesting this? (I looked through the Volume 2 catalog in a store, and was very skeptical about this product myself, and I own Vol 1... what's with all the repetition and goofy ""groups of 35mm slides""??)"
1,Definate Downgrade,"If you don't own volume one, you will probably like this suite. If you do own volume one, you will definately hate it. Absolute waste of money at half the price. Most of the pics are washed out tapestry scenes that have virtually no practical use anywhere. And some of the pics are already on Vol 1. In other words, buy Vol 1, skip this disaster."
4,Lots'o'stuff,I'm an art director who has lots of experiance with cheap clients that don't know the value of quality photography. I've had to settle for simple type and graphic approaches when a photo (even a small icon like photo) was needed. This product has enhanced my ability to offer dynamic compositions that would have been out of my budget otherwise. Tousands of photos at the cost of one high quality shot from the traditional photo retailers??? How can you go wrong?
4,GRITTY,"This is a homie of ESHAM & NATAS, but it isn't like thier music. this a more slowed down pace, like screwed music almost. it's pretty good, but not for everyone. it's definatle raw, dirty & grimmy music"
4,Interesting!!!,I purchased this book because a friend of mine showed it to me. It is interesting figuring out one's personality. It is right on the money as to how you are in life. An eye opener.
3,A Classic,"I must admit a personal prejudice when it comes to this book in that I met the author some years after I'd first studied it as my introduction to Numerology, a field of study that has become a primary tool to my work as a counselor as well as psychic entertainer. I can only encourage the folks at Llewellyn's to bring this title back, it is long overdue."
2,Ha Ha You'll Be Dead After This Album,"Don't call me a hater on Green Day cause I tried to love this I really did, I'm a huge Green Day fan and as hard as I tried I just couldn't get myself to like this album. I remember long ago I was highly anticipating this album thinking about how much I love Green Day and it's been awhile since an album...but I wish I wasn't so excited.With a few highs and lows (Main high: Ha Ha Your Dead...Main Low: Scumbag)this album is a failure. So bad I was almost skeptical about buying American Idiot the day it came out....(good thing I wasn't) Just there isn't much more to say except spend money on American Idiot, Dookie, Kerplunk, Insomniac, Nimord, 1037/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours or even Waiting, but please stay away from this pile of Green Day ""Dookie"" if I may...."
2,If I had wanted Teen Pop I would have bought N*Sync,I love all the other Green Day stuff I have but this CD is not up to par. The songs ane not interesting and are moving dangerously close to the Teen Pop genre.
3,shenanigans is an OK cd,"shenanigans is an OK cd.it has only about four good songs, the sound of green day seems to change every album they make. shenanigans has an old school punk sound to it, which isn't that bad, green day is seeming to lose theyre touch,the songs are kinda beginning to get more of a [...bad] sound to them, its a great cd to listen to if not really doing anything, the songs have a great melody to them, i would buy shenanigans if you like old punk, if not, you may be dissapointed"
5,Pop-Punk at its best,"I've only liked Green Day for about a month, but they're arguably the best punk band I've ever heard. They rank up in the top along with Sum 41, Blink 182 and Descendents. Shenanigans was the second one I bought, and I was happy at the awesome sounds that these guys come up with. The best song is definitely ""You Lied"", and ""Espionage"" is also good. If you haven't heard Green Day yet (which is hard to believe because their ""American Idiot"" video is all over MTV), be sure to check em out."
3,DECENT,"THIS REALLY ISN'T AN ALBUM SO I WONT BE HARSH. THIS IS A COLLECTION OF B-SIDES, ETC. NOT BAD BUT NOT GREAT."
1,worst of the worst of all of the green days albums,really this album was a complete and utter waste of time for green day the record company and every single person who helped in production. shenanigans is not even worth my attention span. it is all the b-sides of their b-sides and most definitely not their best effort-- they could poo out better songs than these.
2,Coulda been 2 songs,"This CD is a total load of junk, and not my type of music. If u take the CD and cut it down to Espionage and Ha Ha Ur Dead, I would be just fine. Green Day is not really my type, so I think they suck."
3,Couldve been better,"I was very surprised when i first listened to this cd. Me, being a hardcore Green Day fan, was slightly dissapointed. Im just hooked on the more catchy punk tunes they had earlier in their career. Even though it wasnt what i expected, its still a good cd."
5,ROCK ON!!!,"Every fan of Green Day needs this cd. It has every thing we have come to expect out of Green Day. I am one of those physco collectors who wants everything that says Green Day on it. If you are like me, you probably bought this cd without evan conculting these reveiws. For the rest of you, this cd rocks. The heaviness of ""Suffocate"" mixed with the slower song ""On the Wagon"" is trully a experience. As for the new song ""Ha Ha your Dead"", you havent heard a song better then this in a long time. So do yourself a favor and buy thins cd. GREEN DAY ROCKS!!!"
4,Great B-Sides Compilation,"Shenanigans collects b-side tracks from the albums DOOKIE through WARNING. If you didn't know any better, this could easily pass as an actual album. It's filled top to bottom with the catchy, high energy pop-punk that Green Day is known for.The stand out tracks for me are: Desensitized, Do Da Da, Ha Ha Your Dead, Suffocate, Scumbag, You Lied, Tired of Waiting, Don't Wanna Fall In Love.The Song ""Espionage"" was recorded for the first Austin Powers soundtrack.My only complaint is that the songs ""J.A.R."", ""Maria"" & ""Poprocks & Coke"" weren't on this. Buying INTERNATIONAL SUPERHITS! for 3 songs is kinda sucky.Tracks 9 & 13 = DOOKIE b-sides.Tracks 5,7 & 12 = INSOMNIAC b-sides.Tracks 1,2,3,6,10 & 11 = NIMROD b-sides.Tracks 4 & 8 = WARNING b-sides.Track 14 was previously unreleased.Cover songs: ""Outsider"" by The Ramones. ""I Want To Be On T.V."" by Fang. ""Tired of Waiting for You"" by The Kinks."
4,Its pretty good.....,"This album is pretty good a few bad songs but thats it, by my standards thats a good CD. But there are people out there writing reviews saying that this cd is horrible. First i stongly disagree but second of all the tracks on this CD are all b-sides its not supposed to be that great. If u go and buy this album hoping for another Dookie then ur stupid and ur gonna be sadly disapointed."
2,dear lord no!,"ok ok how commercial are the boys trying to be?! i mean come on that 2 ""best of"" albums in a row surely this shows lack of ideas on there part? are the mighty green day finally having there well of musical flashes dry up? to me it seems so, if they prove me wrong and release a new studio album with good new tracks i'l take this back but as i said 2 best ofs is very poor, especially if you are an old green day fan as you will have already got/heard pretty much all of these songs, but i suppose for those 14 yr old kids who are just gettin in on the scene this is good for them. that is all =)"
2,Down Fall For The Punk Scene,"The new green day CD, shennanigans, is noway like the green day you here in dookie and nimrod. Green day trys to go more punk with hardcore singing which can't be heard well. I also couldn't even find the *cover song*. Well, Green day has been a major dissapointment for me. The CD is a major Dookie!a green day fan {not for this CD LP}"
2,I really thought....,"This album I am really dissapointed in. True, it has it's ups with Suffocate, Don't Wanna Fall In Love, and Desensitized, and true it does have some catchy beats, but overall, this album is a complete flop. This album which came 2 years before AI is the downfall of Green Day. Most of the album is either really really fast, or depressing and slow. For those of you who are AI fans, this is NOT the album for you. I listened to this album after finding out about AI in the beginning of '05. I was so disgusted that I deleted the album from my computer until the summer when I put three songs on it. For Green Day, this album is a complete failure, and there is hope for all of you fans...Green Day...New CD, Coming out from Summer 2006-Early 2007!"
5,Totaly great!,"You like b-sides? Green Day and covers? Shenanigans, yeah its a weird name, but I like it! - This cd is for you! Ha ha You're Dead, I'm gonna sing that amazing song if an anti-Green Day die! HA HA!Go GREEN DAY GO!You totaly kick ass, you're great, awnsome, extrodinnary, the best band in my heart!If you love that cd you will love all of them!Green Day are doing a new cd and it will be in store in the summer 2006!"
3,Green Day Shenanigans Review,"Well, The album is a collection of b-sides and other songs never released - most of which were better off that way .This is not one of Green Day's better cd's, simply put. Only buy this CD if you are a hardcore green day lover, because otherwise its really not worth it. I would really recomend buying Green Day's ""Nimrod"" release before you buy this. The last song on the Shenanigans album is the only one that truly seems to be a consistent Green Day song, its called ""Ha Ha You're Dead,"" it is more of a true-punk form and is a reminder of why there was Green Day to begin with. You may buy this if you enjoy listening to the stuff that wasnt good enough to put on thier other albums."
5,Surprise! This CD is Terrific! Ha Ha!,"I wasn't really expecting too much from this CD, reported to be ""B-Sides"" and out-takes, but it's got some awesome, memorable, and fun cuts, many of which could easily fit into ""Dookie,"" ""Nimrod,"" or any of Green Day's other well regarded releases.Worth the side-trip!!!"
4,Pretty good,"Not the best of green-day comes out in this album. Its got good covers(thats basically what they do in this album,re-do other songs by other artists)and a few good origanal green-day songs. I would recomend getting International superhits or dookie over this but this is still pretty good."
4,Green Day will always kick a**,"Alright i dont care who says green day has changed there sound. Green Day hasnt changed a single thing. They are making new music, and thankfully it doesnt sound the same as all there other stuff. This CD is really good cause it has some of there hard stuff mixed with some soft stuff. ""Ha Ha Your Dead"" and ""Desensitized"" are the BEST songs on this CD. Ha ha your dead is one of there funniest songs ever and its sooo true too. I think anyone and everyone should give this CD a listening to. Green Day is the BEST live band ever. They put of the best show and its never boring. I sware to anyone that if you ever go to a Green Day concert you will never regret it."
4,exceptionally good...,"this CD is quite good. i bought it the day after it came out. awesome collection odf green day's b-sides, outtakes, and other shenanigans!"
4,yikes yowza and sheesh,"lotus rose is an extremely promising young author. he writes some of the most engaging works of short fiction i have seen in years. everything about this screams ""wave of the future"". wow. nifty stuff."
5,Wow! Love at first blend!,"I LOVE this blender! Wow, it is a must have in the kitchen. I use it, on average, 3-4 times a day while preparing meals. I don't know how I survived without it before but I know I can't live without it now. Worth the price tag!"
3,Too Lightweight to be considered Professional,I like the Blendtec except for one big thing; it is so lightweight that it hops across the counter whenever I blend anything. I guess I need a commercial blender that is built sturdier and a bit heavier.
4,Does it Blend?,Extremely reliable and powerful unit. Easy to use and clean. Is a bit loud when crushing ice and frozen fruit for smoothies. Much sturdier than cheaper models.
1,I would not purchase this again,"I've had my blendtec for 1 year. It stopped working almost exactly 1 yr. after purchase. I had to ship it to the repairs center in Utah (cost me about $40!!) over a month ago and it's still not shipped back to me. I have to say, the blender could handle alot more than a regular blender, but I've used a Ninja and a Vitamix and they are comparable if not better! I made mostly green smoothies and soups. You def. need a liquid in there to blend with or else the blade will spin and spin and make horrible sounds like it's about to blow up. Another reviewer pointed out that the light weight of the machine is a negative. I agree 100%. The blender has bounced all over my counter with almost every blend."
5,Love it!!!,"I use my Blendtec at least once a day. I make my own smoothies, soups and hummus that is cheaper and healthier than what I can buy. I wish I had gotten one years ago!!!"
2,here goes my baby,"i was waiting to see the durability before doing a review. i had it for one month, used about 150 times. The container was scratched, and the blade kept jamming. It would jam with ice, with milk and cornstarch (to make puddings) and when i tried to do hummus which is a mixture of chickpeas and spices..it started smoking did a overheating alert and stopped. Now i am just hoping amazon will give me back my money.When it did work at first, it was the best blender anyone could hope for.It was easy to clean, and it turned even carrots to pure juice.Hopefully the vitamix is better than this."
4,Great Blender!!!,"We use it regularly, to make soups and smoothies.It makes food edible for my wife (she couldn't eat vegetables or anything with high fiber content, as it caused her gastro-discomfort).We plan to obtain additional ""blender bucket"" options.I've been told it's better than the Vita Mix (that I've seen in bars), and is used by Starbucks.Great Blender!!!"
1,Bad product,"Lots of my friends have this blender and they love it, but the one sent to me by this company hops around the counter, overheats, and doesn't mix in all the ingredients."
1,my blendtec only works for 3 minutes,"Length:: 0:09 Minshi, i've just bought a total blender from amazon in Feb. 24. The blender serial number is ""TTBR-34133"" and manufactured in ""01/11"".i've brought the blender back to taiwan in brand new and start blending a cup of apple juice then the LCD shows ""HOME 00003"" then goes to ""RESET ERROR"".is there any way or method that i can reset my blender and work again?"
5,Great Experience,"Can't say enough. The product was shipped promptly. I received it before I expected to & it arrived in perfect condition. Love the watch, loved the service!"
1,Too perfumey,I never got to really give it a chance because it was way too perfumey for me or my dog
3,"Pretty darn good, with a few exceptions","Yes, the lack of mute button is annoying.I also like to turn off my ringer at night, and instead of having a switch on the phone (like my previous Panasonic cordless) you have to wade through several menus, while the thing beeps at you loudly for each menu item/choice. When my wife is sleeping while I try to set this... well, it's sort of against the whole *point* of turning the ringer off.The other annoying thing I find is the ""Voicemail indicator"" (blinking light), while a very nice feature, often won't go off after you've deleted your mailbox of voicemail (this is phone company type voicemail service - not built-in voicemail on the phone - which it doesn't have). And now, the thing is permanently on (blinking). I can't seem to get it to go away, even after unplugging the unit. Weird.Other than that, this phone is very nice."
2,Good sound with bad usability,"I really wanted to like this phone. It has wall mount, digital spread spectrum, excellent sound quality, a comfortable handset, and a good feature list. After two days, I can't stand using it anymore.- You can't dial the phone from the base if you are using the handset - defeats the whole purpose of multiple keypads.- The caller ID won't stop blinking without picking up the handset and going through multiple menu items.- The phone won't let you step through the names in the stored directory any faster than one per second.- Speed dial only works on the base, not the handset.- Speed dial and the stored directory don't work together.- Transferring calls between the speaker phone and the handset is a tedious, noisy operation.- No mute button.- Too much loud beeping that you can't turn off.In short - if you aren't a phone power user, don't pay for the extra features on this phone. If you are a power user, find a phone designed by someone with common sense. I'm still looking."
3,handset volume a little too low,"the volume on the handset is too low, especially when using a headset. Too bad because it would be a great phone. It has great range."
3,a different view,"This book should be read as Greek tragedy wherein the inevitable downfall is insured by a flaw in the heroine's character. In this case, Florence's hubris alienates everyone about her. If read as just another story about small-town pettiness, this short novel is 100 pages too long."
2,Not a novel,"This is more the genre of a short story than a novel, and there was not enough character development for me to begin to care about the characters; also the end was a disappointment--I felt the author just ran out of ideas."
3,Middle aged angst,"A short read (158 pgs.) about a middle aged widow making a courageous attempt to re-invent herself.Set in late 1950's in a small English town the obstacles Florence Green faces are not so different from those a woman in this day & age might face under similar circumstances.The malevolence of some of the town's people does not deter Florence in her efforts to carry on with her plans to open a Bookshop which turns out to be somewhat successful, at least for awhile.The most engaging character is the plucky 11 year old Christine Gipping who comes to help Florence in the bookshop.The overtones of a ""rapper"" (ghost) inhabiting the Old House where Florence is residing & operating her Bookshop didn't seem to add anything meaningful to the story, at the same time, it didn't detract either.This just about sums up the entire book. The plot could have perhaps been expanded into a decent novel. As it is, the ending was the best part."
4,This book is the cure for wanting to own your own bookshop,"In this charming little novel, a middle-aged widow decides to open up a bookshop in her small English town in 1959 in order ""to make it clear to herself, and possibly to others, that she existed in her own right."" Florence Green doesn't have the head of a businesswoman, but she is courageous enough to stand up to the provincial community leaders who are against her literary enterprise. The Bookshop is full of interesting characters, and the ending, although predictable, is moving. Those of you who've always wanted to open your own bookstore will love this one (and it might just convince you it's better to shop in bookstores than to own them)."
4,Makes Reading Pleasure Again,"Its like coming home after a long absence and NOT being disappointed . I really enjoyed the ordinary, the simplicity of the story. Miss Fitzgerald creates a tight story full of character. You want to sit next to the characters after the finale and ask questions. Could you be so petty/mean? Why didnt you ask the other question? What is going on in your life? Very good characterizations."
2,"A short, sad and bleak story","This was a short, sad and bleak book. It's actually similar in style to a short story or vignette. I was interested in the book as I enjoy reading books based in England where this was set. The main character Florence, opens a bookshop in a small town which sounds intriguing. It sounded interesting at the start but went downhill from there. The town doesn't support her and sabotages her success. It ends with tragedy and sadness."
3,Not sure what the point was?,"Without repeating what others have said, I had trouble getting the ""point"" of the story. The protagonist ""crosses"" the wrong person and later suffers for it, I guess? The setting is almost too intense, too much foreshadowing of the sad ending. This is one I would not recommend for new readers - get ""Golden Child"" or ""Offshore"" instead first."
1,Holy sucky ending!,"Having received a bachelor's degree in English and about to receive a master's, I can usually come up with a better word than ""sucky"". However. There are some books you close with a satisfying snap--others just end. I just STARED at the last page, like when you look in the refrigerator, thinking 'Maybe if I stand here long enough, food will appear'. No new ending appeared.The book was a little dull at first, but then became interesting in the middle as I got to know other characters and wonder how Florence will do with her new enterprise. I was hoping for a good ending to have made the read worthwhile. I won't ""spoil"" the ending--just go to your local library or bookstore and look at the last line; you'll see why it's not worth reading.It's fine for a 'slice of life', not so great if you want a plot and a satisfying ending."
5,Fitzgerald's characters are incredibly real and engaging,The Bookshop is probably my favorite of this author's work so far. It's not a nice story. Not all great stories necessarily have happy endings. Priceless scene between the two aristocrats toward the end of the book. Fitzgerald takes provincial nastiness and describes it with such beauty it's impossible to be too disappointed.
4,"A quiet, clever little book","Although I probably would not recommend this book outright, I certainly wouldn't disuade an interested person from buying it; the lack of a Hollywood ending makes up for much. In short, _The Bookstore_ is much like the town in which its story is set: sleepy, plain, but not without its charms."
3,Rather too uneventful for me,"I can admire the writer's style. But the plot seems not only a tempest in a teacup, but also a bit unrealistic. Rather similar to Anita Brookner in tone."
2,Not worth it,"After reading many reviews of this book (not just Amazon's), I expected to find a ""jewel,"" but I was sadly disappointed. More of a vignette than a novel, this book's characters are not at all well-developed. We are taken through a day-to-day journey of a woman's attempt to open and run a bookshop in a village that doesn't want one. For all of us who care about reading and books, it is a marvelous premise. However, none of the relationships between characters are mined in any kind of detail, and the reader is left with a flat, one-dimensional, rather moralistic view of things."
1,Love/Hate Relationship,"I loved this book right up to the ending. And when it ended, I hated it. I felt like tossing the book as far from me as I could. How dare she end the book there. I wanted retribution but instead I just got life."
1,A disappointment,"What was the purpose of this book? It was totally unenthralling and depressing. I had read a great review of this and her other books. Now I'm afraid to try any others. The plot was undeveloped, though the characters could've been interesting. Who wants to read about people who just give up?"
4,What constitutes A Meaningful Life?,"If you insist on happy ending, perhaps this isn't the book for you. It's no Rogers and Hammerstein musical comedy, that's for sure. Penelope Fitzgerald, winner of the Booker for Offshore, has crafted a small book dealing with the big issues of life with the skill of the master that she truly is. Set in the English countryside during the 50s, The Book Shop is the story of Florence, a small town widow who decides to do Something Meaningful with the rest of her life: she opens a bookshop. Encountering surprise resistance from some important people, the rest of the book deals with showing how Florence quietly pursues her dream."
3,so much unexplored,"I felt oh-hum about this book. The characters were not interesting to me, descriptions of the Old House were bland and basically uninformative. I found little to praise and certainly did not consider it ""...a marvelously piercing fiction"" as did the Times Library Review."
2,Too Simple - Didn't Pull Me In,"I found myself standing like an outsider watching a simple play - I never felt like I was part of the plot. I wasn't really interested in any of the characters. I appreciated the simplicity of the writing styles, but I felt confused when finishing."
2,"Potential, but undeveloped","This book was a recommendation from Amazon and also this month's book club selection. There was so much undeveloped. Did I miss some symbolism about the Rapper? For someone with ""courage,"" Mrs Green totally lacked gumption in the ending. My naivete made me dislike the ending tremendously. The author could develop the character's more than she did in this very short novel. I liked the writing style and will definitely pick up the Blue Flower. I give it my sincerest ho-hum rating."
1,I Wanted To Like This Book. . .,"But, as is obvious by my one-star rating, I didn't. There was a point, about midway, that I thought there might be a substantive plot. I was wrong. I never felt Florence had passion about her bookshop - and that bothered me: The story of a woman in mid-life, putting her savings and her name on the line to open this bookshop in a small isolated town should have elicited great sympathy from me. It did not. When Mr. Brundish tells Florence that she has courage ""in abundance"", why don't I feel it, as the reader? The ending wasn't particularly disturbing, it merely felt contrived - a way out of a dreary story."
2,I was disappointed,"After I read Fitzgerald's haunting ""The Blue Flower,"" I was excited to read more of her work. At first, I enjoyed ""The Bookshop."" The description of not-so-scenic British countryside, some of the characterizations, are good. But some of the characters are not developed to any satisfaction. And the ending! Not only was it depressing, but it was totally pointless! What was Fitzgerald's message here? Apparently that life, and all our efforts to create a life, are unimportant and doomed to failure?"
4,The Precious Bookshop,"This was an incredibly enjoyable book to read. Penelope Fitzgerald had a precision with words that make them clear and pleasurable. One of the main themes she explores in this novel is the cosmopolitan view verses the small town sensibility. It was exciting for me to read about the prospect of a new bookshop because I enjoy to read just about anything, but many people whose reading is more selected wouldn't openly welcome the enterprise she tried to initiate. But this novel is patronising at all to people who don't happen to be bookish. It is simply a tale about the struggle of a failed idea. The many small comic and tragic stories that ensue are incredibly engaging. The relationship between Florence and her assistant is very touching. It is a sharp observation of a relationship between two generations. I thoroughly recommend that anyone should sit down in a cosy chair and read this novel."
5,Edith Wharton meets East Anglia,"That this novel was shortlisted for the Booker Prize in 1978 is incredible because the thing is only 115 pages long, has a well-defined linear plot, and is starkly realistic. Such is the state of modern fiction that nobody bothered to publish it in the United States until 1997. Edith Wharton meets East Anglia."
4,Life is real and beyond real,The end of Bookshop was difficult for me as well as other readers. It made me sad that people's directives don't last beyond the grave. The economy of style that Fitzgerald uses is wonderful and picturesque. I liked her Blue Flower better and Offshore the best.
2,Heavy,I like a guidebook with lots of pictures and detailed maps and this one lacks both. Knowing exactly where I am when I'm driving is probably my number one necessity. For armchair traveling and tourists with time to read this 400 page book provides interesting background.
3,"Highland Cathedral, Phil Coulter",Strong music with a glorious theme. Okay to listen to once in a while. Not something you would play over and over.
2,Side effects...,"My doctor suggested I take iron and that this would be highly absorbable and not cause constipation. Well, if it was absorbable I can't say. I didn't feel any different energy wise. As for the latter, I was taking this product as well as magnesium and had constipation. I've never had magnesium cause that, so I can only assume that it was this product or the combination of the two. Others may not have this problem."
3,A bit too loose.,"Cute shoes, but when I tried on my size (7.5), they didn't fit. I probably needed a 7. Didn't have arch support either. Had to return them."
4,Cute Shoes,These shoes look great and are pretty comfortable if you only wear them for 4-5 hours. I wore them for 11 hours the other day and my feet hurt badly!
3,A Must Read by those wanting to know truth,This book was very informative and well written. It should be read by every one who wants to know the truth about tithing and giving.
5,Not Legalistic,"Fortunately, this sheds some light for intelligent legalistic readers. Much of the ""nothing but 10%"" ado is not Christ-like and is hardly scriptural, from a New Testament perspective. Many of those things are pointed out here. Watch for the plank in our own eyes!"
5,Distrubing,"This book is profound. It cast a distrubing light on faiths that support titheing as it is performed today. How can the leaders of the faiths be so intelligent, articulate, and misunderstood? How and when did the definition of titheing take it's present form? Who were guarding the gate. One can not deny the authors position on titheing for it is based on scripture, throughly analyzed,and simply presented. Such as exhaustive study of this often explosive subject depicts the depth of concerned shared the the authors. The material presented in this book will keep you up at night. You can't read it and remain the same. It will enlighten your perspective on ""Law and Grace"". Inherent is the words of this book is jesus reply to the jews ""and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free"". John 8:32."
1,"makes the altar impure,,,","tithes and offerrings is Gods only system to bless his people,people are to be taught to give willingly not by threat of a religious system, but give in relationship, this book highlights great points but..., its without true clarity, do we tithe, do we give offerrings, the answer today is YES,,,,,"
1,Falls Short by a MILE,"The author skips the real issue of tithing and the number of Lies that are told by the church. He has compromised truth on the alter of the fear of offending anyone. (Sheepish in his delivery) It will leave people with the same burden of ""giving"" money that yokes people with the same bondage as religious tithing. Having read Lie of the Tithe by R. Johnston after reading this book I found that there is no comparison between the books. Boldness and TRUTH was found in Lie of the Tithe where masking and yoking with the same burdens were found here. I have learned that when Nobody 777 says its good you should look out. He seems to be a religious something or other. The book falls short by a MILE from delivering the solid truth and will trap people into bondage again in the long run. Watch out!"
2,suitable for children,"I thought this was only a mediocre collection of tales, not especially well told, and that it properly belongs in the Children's books category"
5,KILO ROCK BRAVO,"As so many forms, and sub genre's of music develop and change thier very nature, so did that somewhat mundane version of jazz known as ""Big Band Jazz"". In short the essence of what was once an element which had so much talent going for it, but seemed at times to mire in the rigidity of its orchestrations emerged in the late 60's and 70's into a vibrant musical form with dazzeling power, drive, and a new crop of jaw dropping solo preformers. Altough the later, more nationaly recognized Fergeson, and Rich bands would achieve an unbelievable level of quality, in the begining there was Terry Gibbs big Band. The power acheivable by correct orchestration of big groups is wonderful, but the magic is to still have that gutty feeling driving down the middle of the musical highway. These guys do it.Buy the freaking album, and get swept away."
2,Nice but was delivered in poor condition,"The product was received and it works fine, but her physical appearance is very bad, the item was delivered with scratched and marked, apparently this are not new. I can not apply the return policy because I have this in Costa Rica, and return it would be more expensive to buy a new one."
1,ehhh,Rifftrax should just stick to old sci fi movies. It's what I like and what they do best. The shorts are lackluster and I wont buy any more.
5,Go Maxine,"Sent this book to my 70 year old sister for her birthday and she just loved it. We live many, many miles apart but always like to share a laugh...it keeps us young!!! Go Maxine!!!!!!"
5,are you ready?,"Another NYer fan of ""Ph.D"" and his unprecendented ""innuendo out the other""..Philip invented the GuitHarp - on this album exhibits his mastery over the beast as well as the sharpest of wit! (Please note: although ""5 Stars"" is the highest option on the scroll bar, I must agree with Charlie Hunter, who rated this album 5,000,000+ stars in Guitar Player mag needle-drop interview..)"
4,terrific solo guitar album,"Philip deGruy is no ordinary guitar player. His instrument is a 17 string ""Guitarp"" that he designed himself. It's a 7 string blues guitar with 10 ""harp"" strings that he uses both for filigre and melody. If you like Tuck Andress, you'll like this."
3,Modern Jazz Meets Neo-Classicism,"Produced by Robert Fripp, and written by Keith Tippet, who played piano on several Crimson albums and featuring members of Soft Machine, Henry Cow, and ELO; this one can be a tough listen unless your really into noisey modern composition. Some great moments, good solos (except the guitar, why didn't Fripp, or Frith for that matter play ?). A little like Phillip Glass in places. Overall sound is closer to HC and SM than KC'S Lizard and Islands eras which some have compared it to. As you've probably noticed there is more than one pressing of this available. The one I've listened to is a two disc version that sounds like it was recorded off a vinyl album,as you can hear some surface noise in the background. I understand that the shorter version may have come from a better source."
1,one star is too kind,"Those of you expecting snippets of Soft Machine and/or King Crimson circa Lizard or Islands will twitch your heads trying to bite your ears off at what a vast piece of aural nonsense you've just purchased. Centipede is such a gosh awful mess that it is difficult where to start. The bottom line is that too many people were involved in this project-over 50-each of them trying to improvise something to show off their jazz prowess (thought Julie Tippett was a terrible singer before? you just wait until you hear her improvised wailing); what they ended up with was a sonic hurricane of musicians playing barely in tune and trying to play louder than their neighbor. The only track remotely listenable is the last Septober suite where Elton Dean plays perhaps the only recognizable solo on the whole album. Just goes to show, too many cooks really do spoil the broth."
3,it doedn't have subject order,"i am not completely content,because i can't find all the cards for one theme (e.x. graphic designers) in one area specific of this book."
1,out of Africa - Helmut Lotti,"I am yet to receive this item, so cannot write a review, it was purchased on February 10...I am disappointed I haven't received this yet, as I work in radio and am looking forward to playing something different fro Mr Lotti. Here's hoping it arrives soon!!!!"
1,Pure Schlock!,"Helmut Lotti has a pleasing voice, but this is totally the wrong material for him. OUT OF AFRICA is, at least, an appropriate title, though WAY, WAY, WAY OUT OF AFRICA would have been better. Imagine every excruciating episode of Lawrence Welk or Andy Williams that you ever watched, and you'll have an idea of what this disc is like. Never have three-and-a-half minute songs seemed so interminable. On the other hand, if Lawrence Welk is your all-time favorite show, you'll probably adore this disc."
2,Helmut Lotti Romantic,I feel he is either trying to or actually does sound too much like Elvis Pressly
3,HELLA 003399801 Supertone,Install was easy. Directions were average. The horns were not as loud as I had anticipated.They were an improvement on the stock Toyota horns.Suggest going to Hella website prior to install. Note that they use mm not inches on dimensions.Will probably remove & replace with small set of air horns.
3,Hella?,"Really? Mine say ""Made in India"". It's a premium price for something not made in Germany like they used to be. Plenty of chinese knockoffs out there on the internet at half the price."
2,Too Operating System Dependent,"I bought this book for the express purpose of learning and programming PC-BIOS Assembly language functions, because I read the 3rd edition of this same book and found it to be excellent. I was severely disappointed to learn that the very chapter I wanted to thoroughly dissect was rewritten from being operating system independent to being operating system dependent, the dependent operating systems being DOS and Windows 95/98. A good deal of the information in this book depends upon these operating systems and will not work with Windows 2000, ME, or XP.The book provides meticulously thorough backgrounds, mundane explanations, and vague and ambiguous examples. Personally, I wish the depth of information was structured completely opposite.If you just want to ""learn the ropes"" of Assembly and have access to a DOS or Windows 95/98 machine to learn them on, this book will do. If you need something portable, something operating system independent, this book is not for you."
3,Not Good Enough For Beginners,"This book is a required text in an undergrad class on Assembly Language that I was taking. I found this book to be too difficult for a beginner simply, not because of the sophisticated concepts introduced here but because of the errors and lack of explanation. The latter half of the book is essentially like a reference and provided no explanation most of the time. Even for the example programs given in the text, there was not sufficient explanation. I also found that most of the programs (particularly in the latter half) do not work at all. I could fix a few bugs in some programs to make them work, however, this is a time consuming effort. Unless you have a really good instructor who can help you with the bugs and explanation of the code, I will not recommend this book. While I struggled with this book and managed to get an 'A' grade, I would look elsewhere if I had to do it all over again!"
1,a reference book...,"This book is not recommended to anyone who just started learning assembly, as they're very hard to understand.For beginners, I would highly recommend ""80x86 IBM PC AND COMPATIBLE COMPUTERS (Volumes I & II)"" by Muhammad Ali Mazidi, which also covers the subject thoroughly."
2,Too concise for a college textbook,"First, please understand that I purchased this book for a college class in assembly, but I am also a programmer with 15 years professional experience, and some of material is not new to me. I have read a great number of programming books, and with that said, this book has little value beyond reference. It makes brief mention of advanced concepts I am trying to learn, and then jumps elsewhere. The examples are hard to follow, and often to not provide instructions on recreating them. I am purchasing another book to supplement this class, as I will never learn the material from this book."
3,"Typical computer book, not to be read for the heck of it...","I used this book as a stand-alone for a programming class. I found that for someone who has concentrated mainly on C++ and no background on Assembly language, that it was probably not the best book to try to learn from. I feel that a good bit of information is given in this book that you need to know, but only if you have had SOME experience in this area."
5,This book is obviously not good for self-study purposes,"I used this book as the textbook required in my Assembly class. With the help of this book I had a lot of trouble getting started. It was really killing me. But as I went on reading, I began to understand what the previous chapters were talking about. As I got a hang of it, the book became more and more useful and important to me. So This book is really good after all, but only if you don't give up in the beginning."
1,Truely Poor,"For a book that is supposed to be a fifth edition, it is still loaded with errors - general typos and errors in the code examples. The review sections ask questions that are not covered until future chapters. Even the index has errors! On top of all of that, the book does not even comprehensively cover the instruction set. Finding useful information is difficult but not impossible to find. We used this as a college text and if I hadn't already done some assembly programming, I would have been lost. I wouldn't sell this book to another student - if they really want it, I'll GIVE them my copy."
2,"Ok text, but horrible examples","This book is ok reading. As a student, the text is fairly informative, but the examples often are not correct. For example, a sample program in chapter 10, when run, crashes. Many of the examples need proofreading."
3,"A book that hard to understand, sluggish examples","I reviewed this book but I found it hard to understand the language that is really hard. It suppose to gather the students around it who want to read the material to understand, like the book i reviewed ""Assembly Language for IBM PC Family by Willium B. Jones"""
3,Decent Training Ball,"Unfortunately, someone still has my Tachikara Setter's Ball so I went ahead and purchased another. I saw this and though I'd try it as a nice replacement but should have opted for another Tachikara instead. So having already worked with a similar version, this one is a bit lighter than the Tachikara which is my only issue.If this is your first training setter's ball, it's still great for the price. So with the proper use, repetition and dedication, it does its job fine."
3,Really worthwhile indie film for Chippendales fans,"I'm a big Chippendales fan, and this movie really captures some of the spirit of Chippendales LA in the 80s. The guys are awesome. Fitness model Johnathan Aubrey is spot-on for the lead. JP Pitoc (ironically, the go-go boy from ""Trick"") is good too. If you know the true story of the Chippendales guys breaking off to form ""Adonis"", you can follow this movie pretty well (they use the name ""Skin Deep"" in the movie). A lot of names are changed, but the commentary track is sometimes very detailed, mentioning the names of Chippendales greats like Michael Rapp. I didn't really care for the portrayal of the Colón hit man character. Kind of cheesy, but worth seeing if you're a fan. If you're just looking to see strippers, buy the Chippendales DVD."
2,95 minutes of my life I'll never get back,"Just Can't Get Enough is a story, I guess, about the creator of the Chippendale's, and his struggles with the man that took the show on the road. The creator has that man killed, why, nobody knows. The guy running the touring show was making his company a lot of money. Then 3 strippers break off from the Chippendales, and the creator wants them killed. Why? He can't take the competition. Well. Who cares about this dreadful story anyway. There are holes in it bigger than J.P. Pitoc's hair. So with a movie like this, with no plot, shouldn't we at least see what we expect to see, some manhood? Well, no, the guys are dancing in the 1980's, and their hair is awful, and costumes are tacky. Their bodies are okay, but come on, that hair, and those mustaches? Good grief. And we get to see one piece of male equipment. And it's tiny. This movie is so not good."
1,"really, really bad","Wow, what a piece of work - this movie is even worse than ""The Chippendales Murders"" on USA. The guys aren't that hot, and the film just drags on and on. A rental might provide some amusement, but this is most definitely not a purchase-worthy DVD."
3,"Entertaining movie, but these Mens bodies are way better!",To be honest the main reason i got this movie is because of John Paul Pitoc who stares in this movie. He was such a great actor in TRICK that i had to get this one. Just Can't Get Enough is a entertaining movie but its not much more than that. This movie is about the original Chipppendale dancers and how greed ends up coming back to haunt them. Very dark at times but in the tradition of most true stories many details are left out. The beautiful mens bodies in this movie are alone worth checking this flick out.
1,Very disappointing quality,"I've hoped for years to have this mini-series on DVD, and was excited to find out it was finally available. Unfortunately, the quality of the product is extremely poor. Both sound and picture skip and hesitate to the point that the discs are barely watchable. I understood when I ordered that this was not a ""commercial"" release, but thought that it would at least meet minimal quality standards. I would return it for a replacement, but fear that the next set would not be any better as this appears to be a production issue. I would not recommend purchasing this product, but I will continue to hope that at some point the series will be available as a real, quality DVD set."
3,"Great movie, lousy dvd.",This is a great movie but the DVD's all had a problem with skipping and miss matched voice and picture. It made watching a great movie a bad experience. We are going to return it for a replacement.
3,"Great movie, bad discs","Like so many others, I am disappointed by the quality of the discs. I'll try it in my computer to see if that helps. I love this miniseries. They filmed it in New Salem when I was a little girl and I watched some of the filming. I have had a terrible crush on Hal Holbrook ever since. The books are amazing too, but obviously they had to pare them down a bit for the miniseries! It is an enormous trilogy!"
1,Is it too much to ask....?,Is it too much to ask that this is a rental? It's a story I saw on TV - a miniseries in 1978. For what possible reason must this ancient story be a video that can only be purchased and not rented in 2012?
5,a blast from the past,I remembered this as an enjoyable mini series from way back when so I decided to give it a try when I saw it available. I found that my memory was correct it is a really good story with some great scenery and wonderful actors at the top of their game. I agree with other reviewers that Elizabeth Montgomery is too old to play her part as a teenager but as she progress in age she is perfect.
4,Ohio History come to life,"I saw this when it originally aired on TV so many years (decades!) ago. I've been hunting for this for a long time - so glad they finally put it on DVD.The made-for-TV series does a great job of following the book (well... books... it's a trilogy). Of course the book is better, but that doesn't detract from the TV series at all.The story follows the life of Sayward - a pioneer girl whose family moves to Ohio wilderness when it was ""the frontier."" Lots of twists and turns, some mysteries (some are never resolved, but somehow the story makes you feel satisfied). After you watch this you will, like me, want to read the book."
1,1st DVD won't play,"I ordered this in July 2010 and, unfortunately, didn't try to watch it right away. I forgot about it until I was going through my DVDs the other night and found this one. When I tried to play it, though, the first DVD shows nothing but black screen. The other two DVDs seem to be ok, but the series is worthless without the first DVD.If you order this, be sure to play it before the expiration date for returns. After reading the comments, I see other people have had similar problems with the set."
4,Good Movie/Faulty DVD,"I too loved this series back in the 70's and was happy to see it offered again. I am a huge Elizabeth Montgomery fan. The item shipped expediently. Discs 1 & 3 ran beautifully with no problems. However disc 2 would not play. Contacted MovieMars who promptly issued a return label. Returned the product over 2 weeks ago with request to send back to me the original discs 1 & 3 as I know these work along with a new disc 2. Am still waiting on my product. Hopefully, it will arrive soon and work without problems."
3,Bewitched!,"This mini-series was not well received when it came out. Roots was the king at the time and made it tough to measure up. However, the detail and heart of the story makes for enjoyable viewing. The acting for the most part is top notch and the flow is not forced upon the viewer. My copy had a problem with the sound mix on disc 2 where for whatever reason the lips and voices don't match up. However, I still would recommend it and the seller who was quick in sending it to Korea. I won't try to tell the story except to say Elizabeth Montgomery proved she has acting chops and is overlooked because of her paycheck show Bewitched."
4,So glad they put this on DVD,"I taped this off TV decades ago and watched it till I practically had it memorized. When my VCR died, this was one of the few things I couldn't find, a huge disappointment. So when I saw it available, I jumped on it. The picture isn't be up to modern standards - for obvious reasons - but it's still a great story. My only complaint is that there's a scene in Part 1 that isn't there. It very noticeably cuts out and comes back. I returned the disc, thinking it was defective, but the replacement was exactly the same. I'm assuming that portion of film was damaged too much to use. But it's a minor annoyance at most. Don't let it dissuade you; if you enjoy period pieces, it's a must see."
2,Very poor packaging from Amazon; poor product quality!,"Received my order in a timely manner, but the packaging was very poor. The lid to my 50 disk spindle was cracked at the bottom on one of the retainer tabs, and the top was cracked completely across the top of the lid. The lid is pretty much useless at this point. I hope the discs work better than the packaging.Update: I won't buy these disks anymore. Many of the disks would not record completely and a few of them had the media layer on them peeling around the edges. Very poor quality control and manufacturing habits go on here. Spend a little more money and get some quality disks. These will just give you a headache until they are all in the trash."
5,A Celebration of Life,"Daniel Matt's beautifully annotated Zohar leads one into the depth of Jewish mysticism while celebrating the wisdom of our ancestors. Study of the Kabalah requires a teacher, one who can guide the learner deeper into Torah and Talmud, and is not for the easily discouraged. This is a complex book with multiple levels of meaning and Daniel Matt opens the door to the initiate."
3,Annotated Zohar,"The book gave me insights into the Zohar, but I felt it didn't give me all of the passages that needed clarification. Since I am just starting to investigate the Zohar, I'll read some other books and come back to this one, maybe I'll be ready for it then."
5,Zohar: Annotated & Explained,"Would highly recommend this book. It is a keeper, to study, read, and read again. To share with friends. Daniel Matt is a wonderful teacher. He has the ability to take you deeply into spiritual truth that otherwise would not be available. Life changing. Would recommend anything written by this author. He is a one of a kind teacher. A treasue."
2,FOR KIDS ONLY!!,"If you're preparing to take your chidren to Costa Rica, and they are under the age of 10, they will likely enjoy this videography. (Notice that most of the people that rave about this video are describing their kids' reactions).If you're an adult preparing to travel to Costa Rica, A MUCH better overview of the country's geology, politics, economy, immigration, agriculture, ecological convservation, and social history is the the coffee-table book, ""Costa Rica : The Last Country the Gods Made.""It's got lotsa scenery, too, in the form of beautiful color pictures! (Of course, there's no little animated man jumping about...).Skip the cheese factor of Señor Rico. A much better buy for the money, and more solid content are the essays in Adrian Colesberry's and Brass McLean's book."
1,UGH,"I gotta agree with the other reviewer; this is for 4-year-0lds ONLY and adults should peruse the best book I ever found about Costa Rica, and that's the coffee table book, ""Costa Rica: the last country the gods made.""Really, Amazon should be embarrassed to be selling this!"
5,Senor Rico,The movie was hilarious. The animation was clever and brought some humor to the landscape. I've seen boring documentaries that was no more than a travel guide. This brought some of the scenes to life.
1,Lame,"This is some guy's home movie with poor picture quality, distracting video editing effects, and minimal content. The only thing funny about it was that I actually spent money on it."
1,Very poor quality,"This video has poor picture quality.It's more of a cheap home movie with annoying transitions,unfitting music,and no logical sequence.Don't waste your money on this!"
1,Amazing Ways to Make Money with your Camcorder,"Take your camcorder on your next vacation. Shoot random disconnected sequences of video without a storyline, and without using a tripod. Be sure to not have any knowledge of basic camera techniques as you do this. Then when you edit your video add some insanely amateurish special effects, and voice overs. Then sell it. It seems to have worked for ""Senor Rico"" in his ""Costa Rica Adventures"" video.That idea is as great as this video is bad."
1,Do not buy it,"I was very disappointed with this video. It was obviously shot with a home camcorder by amateurs. It was not informative about travel in Costa Rica, and could only be enjoyed by those who were on vacation with the so-called producers. I am in the process of trying to get a refund."
5,Senor Rico Rocks,"My children loved this video and Senor Rico! They enjoyed all the wildlife footage and great Costa Rica scenery. I recommend this video to people with children, or if you are planning a trip to Costa Rica soon. It will help you plan your visit."
1,How can such a bad video be rated any stars,"I bought this video based on the number of stars it had received. It is an extremely poor representation of a country. The video is an embarasment, a waste of time and grossly over priced. If it were free it would be too expensive. Shame on Senor Rico and the publishers."
1,Costa Rica Adventures with Senor Rico,This was the worst video I have ever seen. Very unprofessional and did not do Costa Rica justice. If I based my trip on what I saw in this video I would have never gone. It's 27 minutes of very poor quality video and a total waste of money. I would try one of the other videos.
4,Costa Rica Adventures with Senor Rico,My husband and I are planning a trip to Costa Rica and found this video to be both very helpful and amusing. The footage was excellent and confirmed our interest in having a Costa Rica adventure/experience. We only wish that Senor Rico could be our guide!
5,Light-hearted and Educational video,"I purchased the video to get my family acquainted with Costa Rica prior to our trip. Being a former visitor of Costa Rica (during my single-backpacking days), I found that it highlighted many of the interesting sites and wonders of nature that make Costa Rica a must-see destination. Its light-hearted format and beautiful scenery made it interesting for my children and held their ever active imagination. So much so, that they learned the names of the wild-life to expect during our trip (with the help of Senor Rico) - as parents we couldn't ask for more. As avid viewers of the various 'Animal and nature' channels currently available on TV, we found this to be more informative and entertaining...."
5,Great way to learn about Costa Rica,"I had no idea about what Costa Rica has to offer, until I saw this video. The movie is not your typical travel documentary. It adds some fun to the adventure."
3,Good for hardcore Yuna fans...,"I recieved this order yesterday and was actually quite disappointed with its size. I had no clue that its quite small! But the detail is very good and the shipping was fast so that got some good points with me. Since I love Yuna, I have no problem with it being so small and hey its her ultimate dressphere! I also ordered a Yojimbo figurine and I love that one too! Hell if Shiva was cheaper, i'd get her too!Overall, its OK."
2,The answer machine died after 1 year,"When it works, this phone is great. But just one year later, the answering machine stop working and I have to buy a sepearate answering machine this time"
4,"All in all, a pretty good phone.","I have had this phone for approximately 2 months and so far I like it. I love the backlit numbers, so you can call in the dark. The caller ID is big and very plain to read when you get an incoming call. The answering machine is good, too. I have two gripes about the phone (nothing major). It doesn't really have the range distance that I hoped for and OCCASIONALLY when I am calling my own home from somewhere else, I can't hear my husband very well if he is using the Panasonic. However, I have never had anyone tell me that they couldn't hear me when I am using it. So, overall I would recommend this phone."
4,"Great phone, lots of Features, could use some volume","I too, spent a lot of time researching phones and choose this one. My last 2.4 was unusable with the microwave, so I definietly wanted a 900 MHz. It's a nice phone, the only problem is the volume control for the handset. The minimum is barely audible and the max. is what I would consider a min on any other phone. With the speakerphone on either the handset or the base unit, the volume has a great range, but through the normal earpiece, its a little too quiet. I should mention we have 2 young children and a loud dog, so volume control is a requirement. Other that this 1 issue, it seemed like a great phone, packed with features."
4,So close to perfect 4.5 Stars,"I have looked and looked for the perfect cordless phone and this is the best I have found. One of my criteria is a speakerphone in the handset. So useful for being on hold and listening to voicemail. This phone has: No hiss, speakerphone is one of the best (I've tried them all, Vtech, AT&T, etc.), callerid, digital answering machine that sounds very clear. Size is nice, much better then the smaller Vtech, Panasonics, etc. Sound is much better and speakerphone is much much better. Only drawback is they didn't put caller id on base, only handset. Would have gotten 5 stars if on base also."
4,Fantastic phone,"I used a similar Panasonic phone before and absolutely loved it so I had little doubt in my mind about which brand to buy when I bought this one.Great things: Handset speakerphone - wonderful, build of the handset, talk time battery life, clarity, no need to press a button on base to answer intercom call from handset,slow speed message playback.Imperfect: Delay of 1 second for directory to appear when you want to select a number from list to dial, length of number that can be stored in memory falls short for very important use for me calling cards+international number sequences but I can program part of the number in base and use the combination.Have owned for a couple of months now and have not faced any problem like call dropping or voice muting or low volume.Because of its features my wife can handle our baby and all her phone talk simultaneously :-) Cool phone!"
1,Terrible reception in my home,"This phone has a TERRRIBLE reception in my home.Ten feet from the base and behind a 4 inces separation wall, conversation gets chunky.Fifteen feet from the base and behind a slightly thicker wall, I can't hear anything at all.Suprisingly enough I gave it to a friend of mine in the same building and it works great in her home.All other features are good."
2,More Battery Woes and C.S. Flack,"I have had this phone 4 weeks and the battery is now not holding a charge past one bar. Turn on the cordless phone to make a call and the battery konks out completely. This follows similar problems other reviewers have experienced. Still, Panasonic wants the consumer to purchase a new battery at their expense for a product that should be under warranty and is obviuosly sub par from comparative reviews. ..."
2,Not reliabile,"Features wise this phone is OK, but it broke within one year after purchase day.The volume in the headset became so low, that you can only hear it in the very quite room, even on the loudest mode.The phone shuts itself down every one or two week and you have to unplug it from the power outlet for about 10 min and then plug it back, so it's start working again.The speakerphone microphone is not sensitive enough, you can only use it within 2 feet from the base, otherwise other party will not hear you.The buttons on the headset very hard and sometime is impossible to press.My friend also bought Panasonic phone (different model), guess what, it broke within one year too.I have Panasonic TV, DVD player and microwave oven and they work just fine for a few years now. Based on my personal experience and also reading other people reviews, I think Panasonic has a very big reliability problem with their phones and they should address this issue ASAP."
2,Look Elsewhere,"outgoing message on answering machine always faint, static and a little garbled; can't erase messages remotely so while away the machine fills up-even if you check it; after a couple of years the speaker stopped working, could only here messages when I checked remotely through the handset."
4,after further review...,"This is still a darn good phone and answering system.The sound quality hasn't changed after several months of use.The answering machine is very reliable. I had to reprogramthe time date thingy and it is shockingly easy to do.The only weird thing, once in a while the phone will just lose its connection. It may happen when you are trying to answer it, too. This has happened 3 times over a few months. It just cuts out and has to be unplugged and plugged back in to reset it.But then it is fine. It isn't just my phone, either. A friend got the same one and says hers does it too. Otherwise it is very reliable and we are glad to have it."
2,Loses the signal a lot,"Disappointing. This phone loses the signal from the base frequently, with up to 5 second periods where you cannot hear the person you are speaking with, and they cannot hear you. It gets worse the further you get from the base, but even from across the room (15 ft.) it regularly loses the signal."
4,Decent Phonne,I was really happy with this phone when I first got it. The reception was clear and you could walk all over without dropping the connection. It stores all your previous callers and you can choose to add them to the address book. The best part was the prerecorded answering machine voice. I chose not to change it because the voice was rather amusing. Friends would call and hang up because they thought they had the wrong number.I've had it for a year now and I find that the reception isn't nearly as good as it was and the battery only seems to last a day or two. It's still a decent phone though.
3,Great Features&#65533;Substandard Answering Machine,"I think all of the features are great-speaker phone on the handset especially-for an affordable price. My only complaint is the answering machine. The outgoing message is terrible quality and I sometimes have a difficult time understanding the incoming recordings, which is a bit of a drag. Either I received a defective answering unit, or . . . I would purchase a phone with similar features but better quality answering machine."
2,"Calling from a ""phone booth"" ? Poor Handset Sound quality.","As a Panasonic product fan, this phone is not one of their better products. It has great phone features at a reasonable price but poor sound quality for people on the other end of this phone. People you speak to from the handset say you sound like you are calling from inside a box or ""phone booth""."
2,Handset failed after 9 months,"As others have noted, this product has a nice feature set and reasonable to good voice clarity, esp. on the speakerphone. In fact, I liked it so much that I bought the version without the answering device to use as a wall mount phone in our kitchen.The problem we had was when the handset became unable to link to the base. Since operating the phone relies so heavily on using the handset (to pickup caller ID records, set the time, etc.) it's not really functional in this state.I'm now shopping for an separate answering machine. I've come to the conclusion that it may not be the best idea to combine the answering machine with the phone itself - a failure means replacing everything. I'm really disappointed that the Panasonic failed in so short a period - while it worked it was actually pretty good. While I could return it for repairs, I don't really want to be without an answering machine for the month or two that would take."
1,The Worst Cordless......,I always had clicks and drop outs with this phone since day one. Now that i have my phone over the cable this cordless has only gotten worse. If your not standing 2 feet from it your caller will not hear you. If I had a choice I would go back and buy a AT&T phone. Never had a problem in the 8 years that I used it....I recommend that you do not purchase this product.
2,"Confusing Interface, Suspect Battery, Bad Customer Service","The problems started when the battery wouldn't fully charge. I charged it overnight to it's full capacity, but the battery ready never grew past ""one bar"". Obviously, the phone was brand new, so there was no problem with the charge connection, and the ""charge"" light was on, indicating it was receiving power. However, after three days, the phone never charged to capacity. So I called Panasonic, and they told me to clean the receptors. Keep in mind, the phone is brand new, so there would be no need to clean the receptors. Then customer service told me that there was probably a defect in the battery. They then instructed me to go out and buy an extra battery. I couldn't believe it. The phone was brand new! It's their responsibility to replace defective parts. I'm done with Panasonic."
2,caller id problems,"for over a year this phone has been fine , none of the problems i have read in other reviews. i am having a problem with the caller ID window.it has become imposible to read. then one day it started working again, and now it's not . anybody have any solutions?"
1,Poor quality handset,"The handset only worked for 3 weeks. I sent it to repair.It failed again. Now that the waranty is expired, I haveto throw it away."
5,Great Read!,"I love Gerri Hill's work and this book was no exception. I like the character development, the contrast and yet similarities between them. I enjoyed the tension between the two women and found it believable that one woman just doesn't think she's a lesbian. Guilt by association is an interesting concept in the novel. I loved the picture she created of Northern Ca. too! Is there a theme going through her books? It seems that there are more vegetarians in her books lately, or maybe I am just reading them out of sequence. I devoured this one in one night."
4,What a love story,"Sometimes life is simple and sometimes it is not. This love story is good example of these facts. Had Ms. Hill gone into every detail about these two characters the book would read more like ""War and Peace"" (which many readers start but never finish)than a romance. By the end I was ready for Luke to design a house for me and I would love to have a few of Cassie's carvings sitting around the house. This story holds reality within (just because it isn't your reality doesn't mean that it could not reasonably be someone else's)There were a couple of situational errors missed by the editors but overall just a nice lesbian romance with a few pitfalls on the way.Thank you Ms. Hill for another good read."
1,Not a helpful book!,"This book is not an introduction, does not help at all, and usually shortcuts the solutions so you don't understand how it solved it."
3,More for a Harp Enthusiast than the Average Listener,"Solo harp isn't my interest, so this isn't one of my favorite recordings. I found that it does become background music because one song seems to run into the next. The one redeeming song, one of my all time Carolan favorites, is ""Carolan's Concerto.""Patrick Ball's playing is skillful, and I think that this would be a good recording for people who play the harp to use to learn both songs and technique."
3,Pleasant music but nothing to rave about,"The first time I listened to this cd, I was working at the office and I played it as backround music. My first impression was one of a continuum of sound with very little variation, as if I were listening to a babbling stream. I continued to play it for several days and little by little I began to feel the originality of each piece. The mood is mostly joyous with a tinge of melancholy.Secret Isles is certainly an ideal background music cd. I wouldn't call it great music: it simply lacks depth and color. Fresh but rather tasteless is the best description I can find. Just like water.Finally I would like to remind you that this is a rather short recording: about 50 minutes. On average each piece is about 3 minutes long. Considering the price, this is clearly an expensive cd.My advice is: just buy one. The other recordings must be more of the same."
4,Jammin'!,I have 4 of these for the surround speakers in a 7.2 set-up.They kick when combined with some healthy main speakers! FULL Range-definatly not tinny little surround cubes. ROCK & ROLL!!!
4,excellent for the price!,"They sound pretty even across the spectrum and have a nice open sound to them. The bass is sufficient for everything but the heaviest of rap. I have mine hooked up to 105 watts per channel and they have not given out on me yet. I've never been a huge polk audio fan, but for $200 each it was worth the gamble. I'm considering using another set and others in this line to build a home theater system...thats how pleased i am with these!"
5,looks great sounds better,"I was one of those folks with bose speakers as my front speakers. I am not going to bash Bose, however I now hear instruments that I did not even know were there!! These are very well constructed speakers. I give these 5 stars and you will be happy with them. Well done Polk Audio!! Now after almost a year I completed my system with 4 FXI 3,s for surround and rear surround, Along with a CSA4 Center and polk ps 10 sub The thing that strikes me about polk products besides and more than great sound, is the impressive build quality. Polk speakers like power I am running all this with a Sony E.S 5300 with plenty of power."
5,Beyond expectation,"If you consider to have new speakers within $400 butget, then this pair could be a perfect choice in term of cost versus performance."
4,Great photos by a master,"From an objective viewpoint ""erotica"" and pornography"" are synonyms for the same thing, except that the first is associated more with art than the second. Thus this portfolio of photos highlighting female sexuality where like a film director Roy Stuart carefully arranges everything in the shot. His female models are scarcely less inhibited than pornstars but are (mostly) prettier and fortunately ""au naturel."" (...) The models are interested in each other and don't look at the camera. I would have given 5 stars if all the photos were like this, but there are some which (purely subjectively) (...)"
4,Old school Death Metal at it's best.,Every Death Metal fan knows that the prime years for Death metal was from 1986 to 1996 or so. This album was released in 1994 and on it are some of the best Death Metal bands ever. Just to list a few:BenidictionMasterMacabreHypocrisyDismemberPungent StenchGorefestBrutalityAmorphisThere are a total of 20 songs from 20 of the top bands from back in the day.Well worth the price.
5,product review,"excellent quality, the real deal. great product for pre-shaving cream application. makes skin smooth, protects against most cuts, nice care product for men, although not cheap, use small amounts"
5,Unsung Diver,"I have lots of divers! And most are the BIG DIVE WATCHES!! They are bold statements. They don't fit under a dress shirt, and some have lugs that hang over my wrist. Many are ""CLUNKY.""This Navy Diver is an elegant and classy diver! Understated, unsung and underrated! It is the ""Perfect"" size at 40mm for the 6.75-7.5 inch wrist. It has the magnificent features of a much more expensive watch: a sapphire crystal, a display back, and, a real rarity: an INNER BEZEL! I've had people ask to see me turn the bezel just to watch the glorious movement. It has great LUME, as any dive watch should, and this is NOT the quartz model: it is an automatic. Full featured, you might say!It is one of the few divers that can slip easily under a dress shirt and pass for a dress watch. And you can dress it up or down: bracelet, rubber strap, or leather: really 3 different watches.This is the watch I reach for most often; it's a winner!"
4,A very romantic CD,"It is quite a romantic album. I must confess that this type of music (danzones) is not one of my favorite genres, but this particular album was my dad's favorite and he played it all the time. In time I learned to appreciate Los Panchos by listening to this recording. Eydie Gorme's voice is always beautiful, but against trio Los Panchos melodies, it just seems to ""ooze-out"" romanticism (like in Sabor A Mi). Their signature harmonies add to the album's romantic feel. Personally their best work is in Mala Noche & Sabor A Mi. But if you like their voices primarily, get Epocas De Oro. It is in this album that this trio really shines."
4,Overall An Excellent Buy,"I have tried several 2.4 GHz phones from other vendors, but this one is the best I have found so far. It provides excellent range and sound quality. The only thing I don't like is the short battery life. The talk-time is only around 4 hours and when in stand-by mode away from the base, the battery life is not much better. I usually need to recharge the battery every day. Other than that an excellent buy.P.S. The 900 Mhz Digital Spread Spectrum models are just as good, and cheaper...didn't notice a difference in respect to range and sound quality."
1,furious,The phone hasbeen a gem up until now. It is now 9 months old and the battery has gone bad. The big problem is I can't find one anywhere. The manufacturer is back ordered 6 to 8 weeks. Now the phone is useless!!!!!! Buyer beware. I'm going to buy a Sony. Maybe I'll have better luck???????
2,This would be the perfect phone if the battery lasted...,"My only complaint is that the battery life is very short. We even replaced the battery. The new battery was strong for one day & then reverted to the incredibally short life of the first battery.This is my second Panasonic 2.4 gig phone & both phones had the same problem. The battery life problems started after the return period. I didn't look into warranty repairs as I hobbled along on the week battery of both phones & made sure to charge at all times except when in use.When straight out of the cradle I can have as long as one single 1-hour phone call - but with any additional calls, the battery drops the call. It can barely sit out of the charger for one evening (after work & until bed) It absolutely can not sit out over night."
5,Love this Phone,"This phone has been great. We've been using it for a year, with no problems. The middle keys (4, 5, and 6) seem to be unusually worn. But that is the only problem we've had.This phone works great with the telephone company's Message Center."
1,Steer Clear,"Within six months of purchase the #4 button failed. The 4 was followed by the seven, the seven followed by the 1. I purchased the phone for my home office. The speakerphone has always been difficult to hear as is the receiver. The programming options are neat... not worth the cost.Review based on performance of Panasonic model: PQQT22212ZA"
1,By far the worst phone I have ever had,"I was looking for a phone with an answering machine, caller ID, good design, and clear reception/transmission.This phone does look cool when you buy it, but soon the color disappears and it does get ugly (to its true look). Answering Machine is good, but do not forget you are purchasing one of the most expensive phones in the market on its class (Siemens is way better). Caller ID never fails (yeahhhh). Reception is usually good, but I had complains from people who could not hearing me very well. Buttons do not work all the time. Oh I almost forgot.Operating the phone is not convinient at all, for a simple redial you need to touch three buttons. For most of the people that owned this phone for more than 6 months I descriebed their phone. For you who want to spend that money on this cool looking phone, better think twice. Personally I will never bye anything from Panasonic for the rest of my life. (I really mean it)"
3,Joyce Kirkman's Amazing Twist.,"I really like this book because it is really cool.Charles Dickenson was trying to using the fellings;laughter,sadness,and madness.When I started reading it I became like I was the book and the book was me.If I had a choose would read it again,but not this one."
2,Where is Adam Duritz?,"I'm a huge Adam Duritz/Counting Crows fan, so periodically I check to see if he/they have anything new out. When I entered Adam's name, this CD came up, so I bought it. But guess what? No Adam. Not anywhere I can find. It's folky/country and for the most part I can't stand it.So, if you're an Adam Duritz fan, don't let that be the reason you buy this CD. You'll be greatly disappointed if you do."
5,Wow - Wonderful Book,"I can only say that Robin Jones Gunn has again spoken to my soul in this book. For everyone who has ever tried to be perfect so that God wouldn't be disappointed in you, it's a must read. The descriptions of sights and experiences in Paris are terrific. We see how God uses even the misguided, prejudiced, and legalistic tactics of one sisterchick's mother as a part of eventually lovingly drawing someone to Himself and how He orchestrates events to reconnect a lost friendship. I love everything about this book and the entire Sisterchicks series. The only drawback to these books is that since their effect is to make me crave visiting all the places Sisterchicks go, it could get to be a very expensive proposition. Can't wait for Sisterchicks in Gondolas. I've already pre-ordered it."
3,Nice Remaster,"Although Purple Mark I was by far not their strongest line-up, I still like a lot about their music,especially Book Of Taliesyn which was the strongest of their three albums.Their arrangements of cover versions,in this case Neil Diamonds ""Kentucky Woman"", and The Beatles ""We Can Work It Out"" are very interesting. ""Hard Road""(Wring That Neck) is a cool instrumental. Jon Lord seems to be the most accomplished musician at this stage. I like Nick Simper's thunky bass sound,especially his lines in ""The Shield"" The mastering is very good here, and it's about time these albums were available with pristine sound quality. Prior to owning this version I had a really bad budget CD version that sounded like it was recorded off vinyl.The bonus cuts are interesting, a nice touch, but nothing earth shattering. Overall a worthwhile purchase."
3,Deep Purples Second Album,"On This record they seem to kick it up a bit from their last album.It still sounds dated and i guess it's fun to listen to while tripping.But the songs and sound come together better.Unless your a real fan, i'd by-pass this and move on to there Ian Gillan (Mark 2) phase.But i think it's worth a listen to.Wring that neck, We can work it out (Beatles) sound really good.Kentucky Woman, The hit from the record is OK and i feel it's a bit out of place for Deep Purple. But it's a bit fun to listen to.The Bonus tracks are pretty good, stand-outs among them BBC Wring that neck and the instrumental playground.All in All it's better then the last therefore it get's another star."
4,I was amazed at how much I enjoyed this.,"I ordered this CD because I recently bought some classic early Neil Diamond stuff and it reminded me of that great rock rendition of Kentucky Woman that I remembered hearing on the FM rock stations back in the 70's. It seems this album is the only place you can get that tune unedited.However, I was amazed at how much I enjoyed listening to this all the way through (and the extra tracks really don't have such bad quality). Wring that Neck was also a staple of the FM Rock stations back in the early days, and River Deep, Mountain High brought back memories too.The bonus track ""Playground"" is great fun too, just as it's name implies.I sort of wish Deep Purple had stayed in this groove and just kept putting out great covers and instrumentals, but I suppose they had history to make, and they sure did.So, it's not one of my ""desert island"" CDs, but it's great ""wake up stupid and get to work"" music."
3,Somewhat inspiring but repetetive,"Kind of boring and repetetive but parts were ""feel good."" I plan to try and identify people who 'give me energy!'"
4,Highly Recommended,I'd recommend this book to anyone that feels there is something missing in there life yet they are unable to put their finger on it. This book will challenge you to really pay attention to how certain aspects of life really make you feel. I left a star off of the rating only because there appears to be a few minor editing issues. Other than that read this book if you are prepared to do the work of self discovery.
5,How to Make Money with Paper Tole,"A rare gem, a creative person with a financial background, Dee Overduin masterfully details how to run a paper tole business. Read this book - you will come away with a bank of knowledge on how to earn a living doing something that you love!"
3,not exactly what i wanted,"Bought this phone some time ago....maybe I don't know how to use it correctly, but the two line thing gets messed up and I can't get it back to the correct line when I need to.....otherwise has a good sound, nice size buttons and quite easy to use...just needed a one line phone I guess....my mistake not the phones...."
3,I feel like that I am being cheated.,"I ordered used Panasonic KX-TSC14W 2-Line Corded Speakerphone with Caller ID from Innkeepers Telecom on Nov 25, 2010. It does not come with ac adapter. I checked with Panasonic. Even the instruction says the phone comes with ac adapter. Without it, the phone has nothing displayed on the screen. No caller Id, no time, nothing at all. It functions like a $10 phone. If the seller does not have it. please states so. It stated that the condition was like new. That was not true. Of course, I did not expect to get a brand new phone either. I wrote an email to Innkeepers Telecom to request for ac adapter. It is over a month now. I still do not get a reply. I am very disappointed. I will not buy anything from Innkeepers telecom again. Maybe Amazon can help too. Please think about it Amazon."
3,No MUTE button,Just got it - love it for what it does - BUT - there is no MUTE button - which is a sin for a speaker phone.
2,buyer beware! does not work if you lose power!,"As a long-time happy owner of numerous Panasonic corded and cordless phones over the years, I purchased this 2-line corded phone as a backup in the event of a power failure (when my Siemens 2-line cordless system wouldn't work).Well, imagine my surprise when I unpacked it and read the manual only to discover the phone does NOT work when you lose power! This is COMPLETEY unacceptable for a corded phone -- my older single-line Panasonic corded phones use AA batteries instead of the 9V power adapter on this model.The manual claims that in the event of a power failure you can only use line1. This is NOT true. I could not get a dialtone from either line without plugging in the power adapter.I consider this a fatal flaw. Thankfully I was able to return it for a refund. It's a shame, because there aren't many choices in 2-line corded phones."
2,"Nice Phone, But Lacks Some Essentials","I have to agree with everyone. Two lines are very nice, but the lack of a mute button makes this phone unusable for conference calls. Unfortunately, I am going to have to replace it with another phone that has two lines and a mute button. Fatal design flaw. Lack of a lighted ""message waiting indicator light"" is also a big drawback, but there is a faint message waiting indicator on the LCD."
1,Junk,"Here is why it is junk. 1. creates a buzz on the line 2. Not enough room in back of phone for the cord if you wall mount 3. The LCD is pathetic. Can't see it in a normally lit room. THis should be back lit, and numbers should be bigger. 4. All in all, a real dissappointment and it is going back."
3,Good for the price,"As others have said, this is good for the price, but lacks the features you'd want out of a $200 phone. Two other notable drawbacks - the headphone jack didn't work with two different types of headsets I tried - the volume level was all wrong, even after adjusting it on the headsets. Also, sometimes the CallerID text just says ""Incoming Caller"" (It almost always gets the number correct). The fax machine I have next to it properly displays the text. I would have gladly paid $10 more for a phone like this with a mute button, a message waiting light, and a usable headphone jack and I think Panasonic cut a few too many corners here to get the price down. Personally I have no use for storing an address book on the phone - that's what my computer's for. Despite these drawbacks, it works and I'm not spending $200 on a phone."
3,Had to add a mute button.,I had to modify the phone with an on-off pushbutton to mute the mic. I couldn't find another corded phone in this price range with two lines and speakerphone but the lack of mute really sucks on this one.
3,The Phone's Ok.,"The product works well with good voice quality and the various functions available are very useful and complete. Since I purchased the unit for wall use I was somewhat disappointed with this application, for the phone when attached to the wall, has a inclined aspect wherein the top is out considerably further than the base. This makes both using and viewing the phone awkward."
4,The Luck of Ginger Coffey,"This book is a great book. It is written differently which is very good. As I read I seemed to flow with it and I felt everthing that the character Ginger Coffey felt. Each time something new came up, or another problem arised, you felt for the character, but you knew it would be ok. Summary: very interesting, easy to understand, and factual about immigrating"
3,Too little content for the money,"If you have never heard of CRM or have very basic need for understanding of CRM this book may help, but for everyone somewhat invovled in CRM or thinking about CRM for their organization this book is way to simple and basic. Especially (!) for what it costs, there are better options out there."
1,No technical Support or service,The product is great as long as it is working. We have beautiful gates but our Sentex system stopped working and we can't find anyone to fix it. We called the Manufacturer and their tech support told us that they only sell new systems to dealers and cannot help us. Their dealers tell us they only service accounts that bought the system from them. Since the dealer that originally installed the system is no longer in business we are out of luck. Chamberlain (Sentex) won't even provide us a key to the system to allow a handyman to look at it. I would recommend buying a system where the manufacturer has great customer support if you require it.
1,I think TIGI is self absorbed,"My hair is thin, but I have a lot of it. Since using this product my hair has been prone to breakage and very frizzy. It also feels like there is a residue still in my hair after I've shampooed, conditioned and rinsed thoroughly. I've used a very little and a lot to see if there is a difference, and if I use a lot it seems to be a little better but that to me seems like a waste given the price. It makes my hair so snarly. A few weeks ago, I had to go out of town and bought travel size herbal essence shampoo and conditioner and was amazed at how silky and smooth my hair felt. I will not purchase again."
3,It's ok.,"I bought this along with the Shampoo because my hair was drying out in the winter from running. It was a lot cheaper than some of the other TIGI products I love (Oatmeal Honey & Curls Rock) but still said it was a ""Mega Vitamin Conditioner."" I'm still using it, and its fine. Just fine. My hair hasn't really improved much. I have fairly thin curly hair and I would say it's Normal to Dry during the winter. It's better than most of the drugstore brands, but this is definitely not TIGI's best. If you have oily hair or need something lighter for the summer, this might be the shampoo for you. I don't plan to buy this again."
3,Amazing conditioner Crappy bottle,"I love BedHead Self Absorbed so much that I even ordered it as a subscribe and save. The first bottle I received was damaged during shipping. Not a huge deal, they replaced immediately. The only problem was the bottle itself. I knocked a bottle into the shower and the bottom broke! So I thought ok not so bad yet but out of 3 bottles, All three have broken!! I am very disappointed with the packing. I guess I will have to go back to Paul Mitchell!"
3,Bed Head was Dead head,I was not thrilled with ordering this item. When I purchased the large bottle I bought the Shampoo and Conditioner at a decent price. They only had one of them in stock so I had to go out and buy the shampoo at a more expensive price. what good is conditioner without the shampoo. i felt i was tricked in to ordering only half the package since I didn't know I would not be getting the shampoo till later and wasn't about to pay to ship it back.
5,cap vert penny loafer in steriods,"A shoe for all seasons and any occasion. Comfort you want-no problemo. Looks-dresses up jeans or a business suit. Airport security-slip off/slip on- easy peasy nice and easy. Takes and keeps a good shoe shine. Very versatile because of rubber soles-walk in rain or even light snow -sure footed and confident--looks not affected , after all it is at heart a boat shoe masquerading as a penny loafer with its now classic style . Get all 3 colors."
5,Smells great works even better,This soap is the best I have ever used. Doesn't dry the skin out like most soaps. It is a must try
4,Good book but lousy description,"I just received this book and it was just what I was looking for. Not an overwhelming amount of space, but room to write a few memories and put a few pictures.The description for the book is lacking, though. The ""2-in-1"" is not the first two years. This book actually also includesWhen You Were Young: A Memory Book for the Toddler Yearsby the same author. One side is years one and two. Flip the book around for years 3-5. It's a nice bonus, but I wish the description had included this because I bought When You Were Young: A Memory Book for the Toddler Years used from another seller.If you're considering both books, you really only need this one. Nice for the price."
5,Essential reading if you can find it!,"For any pastor or church leader considering change, this is an essential read. I am amazed it went out of print. Murren offers strong practical advice as well as insightful theory. Most helpful was his handling of the concept of ""paradigm,"" which was the premise of the entire book. He steers the reader to a better understanding of the differing ""lenses"" through which people view their church. It will help you both understand those opposed to change as well as offer strategies for bringing about needed change."
3,"World History, Comprehensive Volume","I read this to learn how American students are taught world history at high school level. Like so many other history textbooks, this book lacks approach how knowledge or technology from one civilization will be transferred to another civilization."
5,3M small wire hooks,These work great when hanging items on newly stained and varnished solid wood interior doors without marring the finish or creating a nail hole.
2,Weak stickiness; ineffective,"I hung several items with these command hooks. A kitchen clock, wall plaques and VERY light sheers to cover the window in a door. Three of my items fell down. This product was not strong enough to hold even my lightweight sheers. Very disappointing. I will not buy these again. I am particularly unhappy that it tore the wallpaper when one plaque fell down and it had been hanging up for a little while."
2,"No success with these products, pictures, posters crashed.","I did not have success with 2 or 3 of these style products. Marketing pitch was great, but my pictures, posters and lightweight metal decor fell off the wall."
4,Can Be Used No More Than Twice,"These are great hooks, and they (all of the Command hooks) work extremely well once, sometimes twice. They can be removed from a wall or a cabinet without leaving a mark. However, the strip that you pull to remove them often breaks or tears, and then the hook can be used only once more and cannot be removed except with some force. This isn't a terrible thing until you get into the (chrome or gold) hooks that run over $10 each."
1,These WILL FALL OFF and Your Item(s) will be DAMAGED!,"We had a beautiful wall clock that fell off the wall and crashed at 2:30am. The clock is totaled, but what is worse is it could have fallen and smashed us in the head while we were sleeping. We used the heavy duty hook and the clock itself is very lightweight. It was up on the wall for a couple of months, and then CRASH... Ruined.I posted a YouTube video to show the damage.Video Link: [...]This is what happens when you use 3M Command Strips to hang things on your wall. They WILL fall off and your item(s) WILL get damaged or completely ruined. Search online for all the bad reviews. Amazon has tons of reviews stating how these 3M Command Strips fall off the wall after a few weeks or months.If you need to hang anything on your wall, please use a nail or similar, but DO NOT PURCHASE OR USE 3M COMMAND STRIPS unless you don't mind damaging your goods!!!"
1,Adhesive sucks,"Cleaned surface exactly as descibed, but hooks don't stay on very good, or atleast not on a smooth surface such as a semi-gloss wall. Tried to hang some small stainless steel pots and lids, but they only held for a few days before falling off. You can easily pull them off by hand. Don't use these to hang anything of value such as pictures or you will be sorry. Seemed like such a great idea, but I expected a much better product for the price. I will never buy again."
1,Awful! Beware! These take the paint off the wall!,"My husband tried to warn me about these but based on the positive reviews and marketing, I believed that these would work out well....however, they left a huge gaping hole in my wall after I followed the the instructions very carefully. I didn't even get a chance to hang my empty stockings before the hook came tumbling down, taking a 4 inch hole with it. Our home is new, the paint was professionally done, I was very disappointed and will now have to pay a professional for repair. Don't take the chance, you will be severely disappointed."
4,Don't come off easily,"I use these for several applications; but when I try to remove them from the wall, the little tab does not come off like it claims. And yes, I am using as directed!"
1,terrible sound quality,"I have two of these phones. One was a gift, I never would have bought two.The sound quality is acceptable at times. At other times it gets a very hollow sound with an echo.It consistantly picks up conversations from other cordless phones, which may mean that other cordless phones are picking up conversations from these phones.Do your research before buying this phone. There are higher quality and more secure forms of communication than this phone, including, but not limited to, semaphore and smoke signals."
3,it's ok,this dvd is a bit on the slow side. The hip openers section is the best but I needed something more challenging. Not for young and/or fit individuals that's new to yoga. Best for the not so flexible people
3,Great!,"I am not one for the gym, so I purchased it to do at home. I am also not very athletic. Very easy to use and easy to follow."
2,missing key steps,"I'm giving this DVD two stars because what is missing outweighs what is in it.Pros- slow, smooth pace- gentle, calm narrativeCons- no separate discussion of breathing: techniques, principles, types- no section demonstrating each of the basic poses used in the DVDIn regard to the cons, Barbara will will mention focusing on breathing or using a specific breathing technique, but there isn't more of an explanation of how or what you should be doing. The same thing for the basic poses. Barbara will occasionally mention the name of the pose that she is leading us into, but without a clear reference of what that pose is or what it looks like, it's hard to know if I am doing the pose right or even have the correct pose to the name she is using.The DVD could be great if there were more instruction on the basics of breathing and poses."
1,advert for Gaiam,this is so locked down that it is not useful. You need to go through all of the ads to get to the program.
2,Not what I expected,Bought this at a bookstore and paid too much. Then plug it in and see that it is a guy doing the workouts in a bland and boring studio with bland and boring speaking in the background. There are way better beginner workouts out there and even many free ones on your cable stations.
1,too slow for college students,The movements through the poses were too slow. We are college students who are always wound up and need to keep moving. This video is not for us.
1,it doens't work!,yo. this worthless piece of trash don't even work. I put the dvd in my playstation 2 (it's also a dvd player) and it don't work. it works for my other dvds but not this yoga worthless piece of trash. this is why i hate to buy things that are electronics because they don't work. I knew i should of bought the yoga book instead. i can't return it because i can't go to the mail office because i don't have a car.
5,I like my firest yoga dve,"I have heard that there are good and bad yoga dvd's out there but I found this one really enjoyable. I do it with my sisters and it makes for some nice family bonding. I especially like the short, 5 minute ones that included because it is nice not to have to stop in the middle of a session. I highly recommend shutting your phones off while you enjoy this."
2,Not so much,"This video includes a lot of different workouts, which only confused me. She does offer some good advice, but I do not like it much, as it hurt my back and left me in pain. The poses weren't familiar at all. I have tried othersRodney Yee's Am/Pm Yoga for BeginnersandYoga Zone - Introduction to Yoga (Beginners)and I found these more appropriate for beginners."
3,This DVD is ok...kind of boring...,"I love my yoga DVDs, like many women, I have a ton. This one is not one of my favorites. I thought it was very boring but I do respect that it is very much for beginners, with that in mind...it is great for beginners!!"
3,yoga for beginners,I do not use this video much. It seems to be for beginners who have had yoga before or who are in shape. The poses seem a little advanced for me. I will keep the DVD and try some of the poses after I have been in yoga for a while and I get used to poses. I like the relaxation and toning poses.
2,Not for Beginners,Good yoga dvd but it is not for beginners because it requires a lot of balancing. The picture on the box says it all. If you can do that pose with ease then by all means get the dvd.
2,Maybe yoga is not my thing,"I am new to yoga. This program may have a lot of good information and technique in it, but I just couldn't get into it. It bored me from the start. I don't know enough about yoga to know if it is the DVD or if yoga is just not what I'm looking for at this time."
3,good for beginner,"As a beginner, I wanted something easy to understand and use. This video has different levels and target areas, which has benefited me as new to yoga. Only had video for a few weeks, but enjoy it. I can do a 20 minute work out after a long day or 1hour on the weekend to start my day. Great Product."
5,This is the best DVD for beginners and beyond!,"What I love most, is that there's a lot of routines on this disk, lots of bang for your buck especially when you're just starting and don't want to invest too much right away. Lots of variety compared to other dvds. Not too overwhelming and she goes at a great pace."
5,One of the Best Yoga DVDs,"Beautifully filmed adjacent to the ocean, with peaceful wave sounds throughout the work out. There are so many routines on this DVD I defy anybody to be dissatisfied with it. The quality of instruction is clear and easy to follow. I own many Yoga DVDs and this has to be one of the best I have purchased"
4,Great for me,"I've tried yoga once or twice before, but I definitely needed a beginner's video. This does the trick. It has plenty of exercises for beginner, then some for intermediate too. I like how it has about 8 20 minute sessions in just the beginner part too. So far I've only done a few but I haven't had to go into crazy positions or anything yet. In terms of the look and feel of the video, its oki. It plays a waves ocean sound and uses a woman's voice for instruction. It's pleasant to listen to, and the setting the instructor is in is calm looking (on a beach in front of waves). My first yoga video, but it so far works for me."
3,Unable to find what I need,CD seems awesome. Tried some of the first exercises. Then discovered they are for relaxing. I do not need to relax; I need to stretch and strengthen. Hard to find what you need.
2,The voice sounds liveless and sleepy,"The voice is an ""voice over"" and not the person talking while showing the poses. Plus the voice sounds really live-less and sleepy. Will not recommend."
4,I lik ethis DVD,I bought this DVD for myself and ended up buying another for a friend who liked it as well. Great for all levels of yoga.
4,Good Yoga dvd,"Hi - my wife and I are into Yoga, don't do it as much as we'd like too but we bought 3 different dvd's for at home Yoga work outs. We bought this one and for beginners its a decent dvd. If you are new to Yoga, or can't justify paying a bunch of money and having to go somewhere and would like to do Yoga from home, I'd recommend the following dvd: YogaWorks for Everybody: Beginners AM/PM. This one is the best one, easy to follow, simple, and has a great a.m., 40 minute workout, and a nice p.m. one to relax your body. I hope this helps!"
2,Too Much Time On The Floor,"This was my first attempt at yoga. I was turned off by so much stuff to do on my knees and on the floor. I wanted more standing poses. It's probably my fault for not knowing a lot about yoga, but it still doesn't make me not regret buying this DVD."
3,Not what expected,"Barbara explains what she is doing very well, but most of the work outs consist of her sitting, laying down, or standing up doing absolutely nothing for extended periods of time. I wanted a work out dvd where I actually did something. Most people of average fitness, or those who don't even work out, will find the work outs too easy. But you will become very body aware."
4,Excellent video!,"Very easy to follow. Took Yoga classes prior. No difference, except now I can do it at home and on my time. Much cheaper than classes also."
1,Slower than Christmas,"I would return this DVD but I waited too long to try it out. MY MISTAKE. Do yourself a favor. DON'T DO IT! If you have extensive health issues and need something super uber slow then this is your DVD. Anyone else, forget it!!!"
1,poor quility,"did not lke the packageing, the dvd's are stacked on top of each other. The instructor apperars to be in her 60's"
1,"Not enough instruction, doesn't focus enough on explaining.","I bought this video after years of not doing yoga, I used to do it religiously...I was VERY dissapointed in this video. It doesn't show you exactly what you should be doing, just vague wording to describe it while it focuses the camera at the wrong angles. THIS IS NOT FOR BEGINNERS.Wish I could get my money back for it.Her southern accent is VERY distracting as well.I do NOT recommend this video at all."
2,not for a true beginners.,"I also had looked through multiple yoga videos and was in search of one that I could begin to do some yoga again. It had been years since I had regularly procticed and wanted something comfortable and as the video claims is for ""beginners"" beginners are some one without knowledge of yoga and this can teach them. Well this is not for beginners, as I have seen stated in several posts now it is a little speedy. I also have to first of all try to still see the screen and be laying on the fall turned around while attempting the movements. By the time I am in the actual movement and able to get set she is off to another move. If I were limber already I would not need begginners yoga. This is more siuted for a change of pace for someone that is a yoga practier and is well aware of all the movements."
5,Fantastic Beginners Video,"What a fantastic yoga video! This one will have a long shelf-life for me with 10 routines on it. The ""Getting Started"" section has 5 different routines ranging from 10 to 30 minutes and they are all different. I'm looking forward to gaining enough strength and flexibility to move on to ""As You Progress,"" where there's 5 more routines. These are longer ranging from 30 to 70 minutes. Still a bit too much for me to handle in one session, but I know I will get there!"
3,Yoga NOT for Beginners,"After working out 3 times a week for a year, I decided to add another routine to my daily fitness, so I remembered I used to love doing Yoga, years ago. I ordered this DVD since I wanted to recover muscle memory. Haha. What a joke---beginners? I don't remember ever doing some of these poses--and she holds some of the poses for so long, I come out of them, and am not in position to move to the next routine. I read some reviews from women who felt the same way, and ordered Yoga for Yourself, and love it. I'll hang on to Yoga Not for Beginners, and maybe 4 or 5 years from now try it again. It's not an atmosphere for success, such as Yoga for Yourself. I feel like she just had someone film her workouts, and she's been doing it for 30 years! I felt sick afterwards all 4 or 5 times I tried it, and that's not the purpose of Yoga."
1,very disappointed,"The pace of the workouts was slower than slow. Her directions lagged behind the video which was confusing in the begginning. Transitions from one portion of the workout to another were abrupt and the editting was poor. She is not graceful in her movements which did not inspire me much. It advertises a wide variety of workouts but in fact, most are targetted to specific body areas and are very brief. The two longer workouts are almost the same except for the addition of a few more challenging poses in one. I am very disappointed with this purchase."
3,OK but not great,"There are a variety of routines on this DVD, and that's good (though if you do them all you'll start to see that big chunks are repeated), but the cadences between the visual, the breathing, and the instruction are off. There are many instances in which you cannot tell if you should be breathing in or out, and if you glimpse the video, you will see the instructor doing something that she isn't describing yet. I would not recommend this DVD if you are an absolute beginner."
1,Sooo boring.,"This video is sooo slow. Even the ""strength"" building section of the DVD starts out with 10 or 15 minutes of laying on the floor breathing. By the time any actual exercising occurs I'm half asleep from laying motionless on the floor for so long. Maybe this is targeted at an older audience?"
2,Yoga For Beginners,"I didn't care for this DVD. I subsequently ordered Yoga for Seniors which suits my needs. I didn't know what to expect, but this was not it."
4,It's O.k.,Not exacly what I was looking for. I was looking for stretch and tone and balance exercises. Not something that would put me asleep! If you're really into Yoga you might think better of it.
3,Exercise,"It was okay, but I think I wanted something that would inspire me to turn it on and look forward to turn it on again and again and this just wasn't it for me."
5,Fantastic,"This would be a good DVD for anyone new to yoga, or anyone who just wants to have a program to do at home between classes. The scenery (beach and ocean) is relaxing, the instruction is detailed and easy to follow."
4,Good DVD,"The DVD is pretty good. It can be a little slow at times, but it's been very helpful for me and met my expectations."
4,Great for a blossoming interest in yoga!,"I bought this DVD because I was interested in beginning Yoga and was looking for a good foundation to start with, I definitely found it. Barbara does a great job targeting beginners and intermediate. If you're new to Yoga I highly suggest buying this. It covers a lot of the basics and progresses into more challenging routines. The routines range from 10 minutes to over an hour."
5,Good choice. Glad I got it,Based on the reviews I expected that it would be a good beginner tape and so far it's exceeded my expectations. If I had been able to find an instructor like this where I live then I wouldn't be buying dvds. The instruction is easy to follow along with and she makes doing yoga something that I want to stick with.
3,Ok DVD for real beginners,Fast shipping...DVD is slow instruction so if you are even a little past beginner I would get another DVD.
2,Not for all beginners,"I have mild fibromyalgia Some of the poses strained my back; I was very stiff for several days. I do yoga and I do work out (lightly) on a regular basis, so this may be good for a very healthy and fit beginner, but NOT if you have any back problems!"
2,Lame,"I've never ever done yoga before, so maybe I'm jaded or something, but I thought this video was kind of boring.If you're just looking to breathe and relax, go for it. If you're looking to increase flexibility and challenge yourself somewhat, move on. Most of the video is just you, lying in whatever position, focusing on your breathing."
1,Need My Money Back and A gift.,not a dvd for beginners... she goes too fast. I didn't like the music or any part of the DVD.
2,Yoga For Beginners,"Not very impressed with this dvd. I have never done yoga before and this dvd does not help me either. She does not explain what each pose is and does not give you enough time to get into it before she's off on another one. Maybe it's just me, but I was not impressed."
2,Choppy Yoga!,"I purchased this dvd collection to use with some colleagues. We were all looking for something we could do together after school to relieve stress as public school teachers. It's chopped up and difficult to follow ... standing, sitting, standing, sitting, ... it stops completely between positions and then just jumps to the next. Also, it doesn't spend enough time on any of the positions to really benefit from the stretch. She does put you to sleep at the end in the corpse position. Buy someone else's dvd!"
2,Need some yoga tools,"This DVD is good for beginners. All poses are not difficult. However, about some poses we need a few special yoga tools. I think it is possible to do all of poses without tools but that it is better to prepare them before you start this yoga DVD."
4,Great instruction for beginners,Excellent introduction telling what the DVD will cover. She gives slow pace movements because it IS for beginners.
4,A Great Start,I am recovering from spinal surgery and this video has such a slow pace into positions it allows me to work only as much as I can at a time. I would definitely recommend this video.
5,Very Good,"I am in pretty good shape, do running with my club and other cardio/weights, but decided to try yoga when I found myself being too tight even with the stretching I would do after having a pretty good muscle pull.Picked up this DVD and have been using it for about six months and it has been very helpful in increasing my flexibility.Highly recommended if you are interested in yoga and would like to learn from someone who makes it easy to learn."
3,Too Advanced,My husband and I are absolute yoga beginners and this dvd is too advanced for us. There is only one routine that we can do. Her descriptions of how to do some of the positions imply that we know some other positions and breathing exercises already. We do like the one 30 min. routine that we are able to do to some extent but had hoped for some variety.
5,my favorite by far,"I had taken some yoga classes at the gym before but sometimes it was too challenging. Barbara takes you through a good pace with room for progression, so this DVD can last you a long time before moving on to something more advanced. The poses are challenging but not impossible, making me feel motivated to keep using this DVD. I like how you can choose the workouts to last from 20-70 minutes, so I can choose which one to do depending on how much time I have. You can target your exercises for specific parts of your body, like hamstrings, or choose a type of workout like the energizing one or quiet evening one. This was a well designed beginners program. No excessive distracting comments, no embarassing looking poses that you wouldn't want to do in front of other people, tips on checking your posture, etc. I would highly recommend this -- no wonder it's the best selling yoga DVD on Amazon."
5,Excellent,"Yoga for Beginners has two general levels, a beginning level which teaches you the moves, and then a level that adds some more moves and extends the workouts. The teacher is easy to follow and she explains everything well. It is nice that there are some things where you are lying down or sitting which were easy to do as a beginner."
2,eh,"Normally I love Steve Madden shoes but this one just didn't look or feel, on, the way I hoped it would... I'm going to have to go back to buying my shoes in person - ugh!"
2,"Gorgeous writing, ugly racism","As ever, Kate Chopin's exquisite imagery fills the many delightful passages in this, her first published novel. However; many appallingly casual, highly offensive racial slurs spoiled this one for me. I found it hard to appreciate the finely-crafted white characters and apt depiction of moral struggle, whilst being so frequently derailed by the vulgar depictions of black servants. Yes, it was 1890, so a few racist references might be expected - perhaps cringed at and overlooked - but we're talking dozens of n-words, scores of disrespectful depictions, and too many ugly incidents to be ignored. What a shame."
4,The Self-assumed Burden,"To live by one's conditioning, moral and religious, or to follow one's heart-- which? Not everything Good is good for us, and in this short novel Chopin shows us the price paid for doing the Right Thing: deprivation and unhappiness, but never a scandal.There are points in this book where I had to stop and admire the prose. Chopin's writing is easy and articulate, just how I like it. Her characters are exceptionally real, their personalities well-defined. I'll admit I picked up this book because I knew there was a drunkard in it and I immediately thought ""trashy fun!"", but no, Chopin keeps it classy. Glad to say that despite it not being what I expected, I was far from disappointed"
2,"Vanity, yes, good no.","Woody Allen has a cameo? I don't think so....Anyway, my own feelings towards this film is that it is decent, but no where near what could be accomplished if Jittlov would stop playing martyr and move on.I'm waiting for a DVD of this--containing the movie, and his short subjects--as many that can be fitted onto a disc. I don't think that will happen, but I can dream, you know.Please do like the fact Jittlov got a movie made. Just be honest about it and say ""it's nice, but not that good a film.""With a shoe string budget, it accomplishes many things. But the budget keeps it from accomplishing anything where Jittlov's imagination would work wonders.Too bad Jittlov got into a snit over the film. He did a subliminal in the flick that says ""Mike Jittlov can do anything."" Except forgive, move on and do something new.I think everyone would like that, wouldn't you?"
4,A cult favorite,"This little movie has become legendary among animation buffs, and the creator, Mike Jittlov, a bit of a legend himself. Part of the legend has to do with all the Hollywood machinations that Jittlov set out to lampoon and that ended up biting him in the end.Watching the film today is a bit of a disappointment for anyone raised on the special effects of the post-Star Wars era. The effects aren't anywhere as impressive as when Jittlov made this film. Jittlov's acting and that of much of his mixed amateur-professional cast is indeed amateurish, as is much of his directing. The story is weak, and is mostly one long rant against Hollywood.Yet the film still has a certain undeniable charm, and for anyone involved in trying to self-produce a film it's a must-see- or a must own."
3,WHERE IN THE WORLD IS MIKE JETTLOV WHEN YOU NEED HIM!,"I Bought this to replace my aging orginal. There was some differences in the two tapes, and it by far showed me that the original is better. I do recommend the tape though as it is PURE ENTERTAINMENT. Wizard is a fun movie for the WHOLE FAMILY TO WATCH. It is highly refreshing from the violent/sex films put out today. It pokes fun at the system in many ways. I only hope that in the future someone may record the orginal in DVD with the entire movie and trailer intact, and in the quality this fine movie deserves. I plead, what ever happened to the magic this fine crew had...Wizard of Speed and Time II? (hint)"
4,A lesson in what can be done without a computer,"I have a copy of the original mini motion picture (the three minute wonder) created in 1979. This is a fantasized version of how that film was made. The original is chopped up and served within this film. A shame, actually, because the original was a tight and funny film. It is amazing what a genius like Mike Jittlov can do with stop-action, before the days of computer-generated animation. Makes you think he could have done ""Toy Story"" 20 years ago. Still, if you're an animation fanatic, this is a must-have."
4,The fastest wizard I know,"The first time I was introduced to this movie it was back in 1989 by a friend of mine who was a big movie buff. He and I worked together at an AMC movie theatres and he showed me the movie about this guy and his ability to perform special effects, and from that momemt on I was hooked on majic movie making. I lost track of my friend, and eventually forgot about this movie, but just a month ago it all came back to me, so when I went to Amazon.com to seach for it, there it was, from the time I sent for it until the time that I received it, it was less than a week. the service was fast and the product was just as I expected it. The movie is fun to watch and the special effects are incredible considering that back then they didn't have all the technological advances in movie making they have today, plus the corny jokes are still funny even after all these many years. thanx a million."
4,Where's the rest???,"I loved the book, It kept me wondering what's going to happen next! It's all good until I reached the end... Where's the rest of the story?! I could not believe it just ended that way. Totally leaves you hangin!"
2,Disappointing and unrealistic view of high school girls,"I was really looking forward to reading this book but it was such a disappointment! Don't expect a realistic view of high school girls' search for popularity and the mistreatment of those who don't fit in. This is a hokey play on witchcraft (trying to catch the Harry Potter crowd?) and popularity. It's too cheesey to be scary or disturbing & it's just plain silly without being humorous.This is definitely NOT ""Mean Girls"" or like it, & I'm not sure why the group of girls are called ""The Bitches"" when they are not really mean or cruel to everyone at school. They even rotate having lunch with all the different groups just so they can continue to be adored!The plot is just so unbelievable and unrealistic it's almost insulting. Don't waste your money on this one! (Check it out from a library if you're still curious)"
1,Loathed it...,"I had some decent hopes for a decent read... Wow, did I set my sights high with that... It's a tedious read, full of mildly disturbing imagery and a deeply depressing ending that left me wanting the two hours of my life back... It strikes another blow for ""witches"" as evil doers, which I also found annoying...Honestly, I just thought this book was awful... Horrible, really.I will say this for it, it has a pretty darn cool cover... Which is what lead me to it... Hence the often used phrase of ""Don't judge a book...""Seriously though, worst book I've ever read..."
2,Don't judge a book by its cover,"I had picked up this book at Barnes and Nobles because the title looked good and it sounded like the movie Mean Girls(one of my favorite movies). It started out good and I was excited that Jane, the main character, finally was becoming part of the popular group, the Bitches. Then when she tries to be a good person she gets stabbed in the back by the person she was trying to help. This angered me. Jane was a rebel and was doing good and all she got out of it was being smacked in the face. Oh yeah and she got Phil as a friend or whatever. It was a bad ending. There was no happy ending after the good deed. After reading all I could think was THIS SUCKS! If you want to see the good girl that everyone can relate to get hurt and have an awful life in the end then you should read this book. If your like me and enjoy when people get what they deserve, then STAY AWAY FROM THIS BOOK!"
3,It started it out good but,"As the story progressed I felt annoyed by the main character Jane. It didn't really explain the whole story behind the witchcraft and the background of the other people in the Witch Clique. And it ended really abruptly. If she'd explained the story behind it and gave it a happy ending where everyone wins, I would have liked it better."
3,Rhymes With Witches,"Rhymes With Witches by Lauren Myracle is one book you can't put down. The main character,Jane, wants to be popular so bad she will risk anything, more than she thinks.I really enjoy this genre the book is. This book is realistic fiction. This is a good genre for teenagers because it is something you can relate to. In this book she is in high school, and I could relate to some of her drama of trying to be popular.I really recommend this book to middle-high school students!"
5,My 12 yr old's copy was CONFISCATED by her teacher! GRRR!,"Since moving 2 yrs ago, my 12 yr old daughter has been attending a less-than-mediocre elementary school. Her 5th grade teacher started to have daily ""free reading"" time for his students...which, at first, I thought was great. I went online & bought her a bunch of young adult books, including this particular one. Day one of reading this book in class...her teacher hauls her up to his desk & confiscates the book saying that the title eludes to profanity. Mind you, this is a public school...not a religious one. Of course, he thought it OK for the rest of the students to read Cosmo Girl, various violent comic books, etc. I'm truly pissed off.Anyway, my daughter LOVED the first 25 pages she was able to read before confiscation....now she'll have to wait until the end of the school year to read the rest. *Sigh*"
2,Good Attempt,"Rhymes with Witches is about a social outcast, Jane, who gets invited into the school royalty group called The Bitches. I found this book to be exactly like the rest of Lauren's books. Even though her books have a very shallow plot, you can't seem to put them down. And then once you get done with it you feel very dissatisfied and wondor why on earth you gave that book the time of day. One of the reasons I hate this book so much is because of the characters. The only character you're really supposed to like is Jane, and I found her very annoying and tiresome. I hated the ending as well. When Jane finally tries to do the right thing, she winds up having nothing but Phil, the only semi-enjoyable character in the whole book. I personally think this book sends the wrong message to readers, and I discourage anyone from buying it."
2,Hugely Disapointed by Myracle,"I am absolutely appalled by this book. As a huge fan fan of the ttyl series and other Myracle novels I could not believe how dreadful ""Rhymes with Witches"" was. The beginning was intriguing, a real page turner in fact, but there were a lot of loose ends that weren't fixed. The last chapter seemed fit for the middle of the novel, not the end leaving a very confusing and quite frankly ""freaky"" mystery on the future of the character. I suppose that type of fill-in-the-blank ending works for some books, but in this case it only made the mediocre plot and elementary prose writing a bust."
5,A must read,"This book is tops. Every so often Flugel remembers he's a Freudian and slips in a couple of typical Freudian ideas. When he's not doing that - which is about 99.9% of the time - his writing is fascinating for anyone interested, or even not interested, in clothing/decoration. If you're wanting to throw off Protestant hang-ups about taking some pleasure in the act of dressing or decorating yourself and/or others, this book will help put it all in perspective for you."
4,Theoretical basis of fashion and why we wear clothes,"I've read the 1950 pressing, and am about topurchase this newer edition. The older edition lays the groundwork for clothes wearing and presents theoretical basis for fashion changes. Flugle presents many pictures to illustrate his primary points, and has created a very readable text."
3,Temprement Specific Methodology,"While Mc Mains principles are solid, the methods in this book are very dangerous for an amateur to attempt. This book should only be read as a piece of reference material in an attempt to better understand the K9 guardian.Also these methods will only produce a stable guardian if the dog is working in agression comfortably. If the dog is not , and is working with too much defense, the result will be an animal that is dangerous to the general population. It is paramount to have the right dog for the job. The average pet type dog will not be able to handle Mc Mains' program."
5,I was unable to put the book down.,"This book provides an informative approach in regards to protection training. There were several times when I would read and something would click about the training I have done. If you want to know if protection training is right for your dog or your, read this book."
4,excellent book,"Joel McMains book, manstopper is an excellent book. The thing that suprises me is that first of all he stresses safety, for both the dog and the trainer. He also emphasizes that not all dogs are up to being protection trained. I do however recommend that your dog first be trained using his other book ""Dog Logic"". My german shepard is only 4 months old which is not quite old enough for protection training, but when she is old enough she will be unstoppable. This book is highly recommended."
1,It doesn't clearly describe the techniques,"I would prefer less jokes and more essence. If you are looking for a training manual you will be dissapointed, it is like a novel. It is interesting only for begginers and it doesnt help with problems, also the ""out"" technique is from the last century. Finally, if english is not your native language you would find this book very difficult to read. I dont recommend this"
2,What was the Goal of this Book?,"It seems like the author spent more time telling you NOT to train your dog to be a guardian than he did telling you how. While I appreciate the warnings, it almost felt belittling in that it was ""unless you're a professional you can't do this."" I admit I didn't finish the book, and I ended up training my dog on my own."
3,Very old fashion training,"I think this is very old fashion book, pinch collar is not used anymore for dog training. I guess this book will help to training your dog, but I will find some other new ways to work with mine."
3,Very informative.,My husband used this book extensively to train his dog. We both found the book interesting and helpful.
1,worse book I ever read...,It's the worse book I ever read. -The book in White & black color. -The writer has written his own thoughts and experiences. -It's all about conversation. -And you **must** have those equipments to train your dog. -Very difficult to read and applying what the writer had written to your dog.
5,"Now that I have this, I can't live without it!","This case is the handiest thing I have ever had for a laptop! I take it everywhere and I get lots of comments on how useful it seems to be. I can go straight from my home office, to my car for field work, to the main office, and back home without ever taking my laptop out of the case. The case makes it so easy to set up anywhere and do computer work. It's also great when I want to use my laptop while in the bed or on the couch. I have had no problems with it and the dark brown color is so classy looking. I have had several of my friends and co-workers order one also."
1,Sturdy and awkward: A bad trade off,"In brief:Well constructed clam-shell type hard laptop case. Container built in for AC line is much too small to contain the line, adapter and the mini-mouse many of we laptop users prefer to use. Additionally, the built-in hole for the wire to exit is in the wrong place for my ACER (14.1"" screen) and for most other laptops I have used.I am aware that this review is not complimentary as are the others.I suggest STRONGLY that you do not purchase this item online until you have tried it on with your own laptop in a retail store. It may work fine for you - for me, it was a waste of money. I didn't even bother returning it. I figured $20. was a reasonable price to pay to be reminded of a lesson I should have learned a long time ago."
4,Happy Winter Hands,This is a light and non-greasy cream with a pleasant scent. It keeps dry wintery hands feeling nice and smooth. It's also soothing on small scratches.
2,not a good choice,"Reading the first review I thought this cream will help my skin in the healing process. I was terrible wrong, it worked the other way. :-(The product was sent very fast and in good condition."
5,Truly inspirational!,"This is Manolo's second album since going solo. There is so much to this new album, eclectic musical styles, highly intelligent lyrics incorporating a great deal of poetry and deep spiritual thinking. The world Manolo Garcia creates in ""Nunca el tiempo es perdido"" is of love and an affinity with the non-material world, a great escape, especially in the times we're in.There is an exquisite array of musical instruments, i.e. The violin in two songs ""Con los hombres azules"" and ""alegre como una mosca ante un pastel de bodas"" played by Farhat Bouallagui adding a strong Middle Eastern/North African flavor to those songs. The sounds and creative style of this album truly transcends the mediocrity of our times musically, I don't know if I've heard anything this good in the new milennium. Baring in mind that this album was released in Spain back in May 2001. Every song in this album deserves five stars. This album is a complete winner!"
4,"Fun, retro toy","Fun retro toy that was a great rainy day project. The six year old that I bought it for had a blast coloring them and then watching them shrink. A little bit brittle once baked, so not great for really little ones."
3,Dialog Chapter,"This book has a very good dialog chapter. I especially enjoyed the section on subtext. Sometimes what a character says is more important than what he/she doesn't say. Dr. Seger talks a little about her life in Wisconsin and about having your movie actually produced. In spite of the fact that yes, you probably do need to have connections, I really enjoyed her book. It made me want to finish my Different Flags script and to actually see it on the big screenDifferent Flags. Eugenia Renskoff"
1,Agree with reviewer from Cleveland,Putting a CUT TO in your spec script is a huge red flag for Amateur. This book is proof that even a professional can give bad advice.
4,Interesting book,I think I found out about this book when I was looking up information about Amazons. It is very informative and I liked the way the book was organized. I lent this book to my Physical Anthropology teacher and she likes it.I do have to admit that I was unsure about the Mother Goddess information - I don't think that there was one religion focused on a Mother Goddess at that time - but everything else looked well researched.I recommend this book for anyone who is interested in women in military roles and it's history (in ancient times that is).It's definitely worth your time.
5,A general tour of the Silk Road...,"Jeannine Davis-Kimball tells us about her adventures in exploring women's roles in ancient Eurasia through archaeological sites, Greek and Roman legends and how the people of the steppe tribes live now. She moves across the land with the speed of thought, from the mummies of China to the warrior queens of Erie. Woman were nurturers, warriors and leaders (and still are in Mongolia) sharing both power and responsible within the tribes. I think the best part about the book is not only showing that women were sometimes in charge but that men within these societies were also nurturers and shared with the daily chores. Maybe both men and women were just too busy with life to worry about sexism and gender issues. Maybe sexism is a byproduct of progress?The book covers alot but doesn't get bogged with too much detail. Very much up-to-date information. I don't think I agree with one or two points but it's an enjoyable book to read."
4,Warrior Women,"This book is an excellent account of the lost female warriors of history. Well researched and presented in a very easy to read style. Throughout the book there are sections which contain facts and data that link to the chapter that you are reading, this adds detail and interest to the topics.The author J Davis-Kimball is very obviously enthused by her subject and recounts her archaeological experiences with a keen eye for detail and story telling.Overall a very enjoyable and enlightening read."
3,Warror Women,"This was an interesting book. I purchased it after seeing the PBS special. It is easy reading and informative but, I do think that much of the interpretation of the physical remains is just conjecture. The pictures were well done and the short histories attached to the chapters were very informative."
4,"Action packed, great performances",Must see... Not your typical Hollywood smash & grab shoot em up style action flick. Great performances by both the main Character and supporting. Great ending.
3,"Underwhelming, but worth a rental","This movie has it's moments, but is a missed opportunity. I have never watched a film with such an interesting subject matter be so boring most of the tiime. There is virtually no character development. The chase scenes are extremely well done and that is what saves this movie from being a total disappointment. I had read many positive reviews and was expecting more. I am an American that really enjoys foreign films. I hope someone else tells this story again that is capable of really good story telling. It's clear that the film crew is very talented to do some of the things they do, but someone really needs to re-tell this story and do it justice. Definitely rent before buying. The PQ & AQ are top notch."
1,My Lovely St. Francis has Lost His Head!,"This is a truly gorgeous statue but probably should only be used indoors.I bought one late this Spring and liked it so well I had one drop-shipped to my parents in California. Unfortunately my St. Francis fell over during a rainfall, and his head broke off. My father was smarter than I was- he mortared his to a rock. I had no idea it would be brittle during warm humid weather- if you buy one and have it out in the winter I'm sure it would be much worse!I want Amazon to send me a replacement and I will return the broken one so the coroner can do a forensic examination. The St. Francis just isn't the same holding his head in the crook of his arm."
1,Cheap!!,I've had this set of screwdrivers for close to a year now and none of them have held up. The edges on the heads are all worn and I have not used them that much. They're all pretty much usless now. Spend a little more money and buy something worth the money you paid for it. Stay away!
3,"Not the best, not the worst","It's difficult to find any apparel in Stinger Yellow camouflage, but be warned that the yellow is very subdued when compared to the yellow of the same pattern in cargo pants. It is what it is. Until you can find a yellow camo shirt with brighter color, this one will have to do."
4,Get the bigger size!!!,This is a great pattern shirt. I usually wear large or XL but these shirts do run very small even before washing forget about drying it. I put on the shirt and I looked like one of those guys who works out and wears really tight clothes lol. I can't stand that lol. I have been in the Army 12 years and like to wear these types of cloths but im def gonna have to go up a size or two. Also the shirt doesn't really stretch. As for my large shirts ill wear them in the house only and maybe let my lady friends wear them too. Ill def buy more of these shirts but I will experiment with the sizes. Ill post this on the other shirts I bought from the same place.
5,Great Fit,"Purple is my favorite color and I love camouflage, so I couldn't resist this t-shirt. It is a comfortable fit, even after several washings. I get compliments on it whenever I wear it."
4,Tri-Color Desert Camouflage T-Shirt Size LARGE,Good pattern. Size runs a little small. All in all happy. Run with a multicam setup and works very well.
3,Problems,Is anyone having problems eith this disc? I bought it and the tracks aren't in order and Child in Time is missing!Not cool!The music's awesome - I don't know if I just received a bad disc or something!
3,Purple rocking in '70,"Deep Purple Scandanavian Nights has some excellent jams on it (Speed King,Wring That Neck,Child In Time).Heck,the album is about 2 hours with only 7 songs!But thats the creativity of Deep Purple live.Its almost as good as Made In Japan,but Blackmore's sound and Gillan's voice could of been better.But hey,thats live."
4,I don't think this is the soundtrack of the movie,"If you're looking for the very first song that plays on the American version of the movie it's not on track 8. (I bought it for this reason, so I know). The words are ""fantasy, the neverending story, fantasy, the neverending story, fantasy..."" NOT ""Turn around, look at what you see, etc.."" So don't buy this CD thinking that's the song. The review above is misleading and that's why I bought it. It's good music on it's own, it may just not be what you're looking for."
1,Molten Super Touch,this volleyball was not the volleyball that the NCAA women use. It was a reject. Claims to be a super touch. More like Super Slouch. Have been playing with this so called volleyball for a month now and leather is beginning to crack. Ball has no bounce to it and feels dead. I have played with other super touch volleyballs by Molten and they were great! I bought 2 of them and they were both crap. Either someone is making cheap imitations of Molten Super Touches like mine or Molten does not have a quality control and makes great ones and then piss poor ones.
5,I'm jonesin' for the desert,"I go out to Tucson once or twice a year. One of my favorite places to take a walk or go hiking is in Sabino Canyon Recreation area, part of Saguaro National Park, which just so happens to be down the road a piece, so to speak, from Steve Roach's place. This album would be a good soundtrack for a movie shot in Sabino, in all the seasons and in all kinds of weather.Its transporting, and full of desert emotions and desert spirits,so much so that sometimes its almost frightening...the desert can be that way.I'm currently also reading Edward Abbey's ""Desert Solitaire"". The desert in print, like Roach's album is the desert set to music.I'm listening to Desert Solitaire a lot now, a really good CD. I guess I'm just jonesin' for the desert."
2,Not great,"This product was good, but not great. We ended up buying a different press for about the same price, and we like it significantly better. This one was just too hard to get the patties out, and didn't provide a good indication of how big or well formed the patties are. I'd suggest adding measurements (half pound, 1/3 pound, etc) to the outside, or provide a clear case so you can see that it has been properly formed without gaps.Also, the silicone liner thing was hard to remove and put back in. Overall, I would not recommend this one over alternative products available on Amazon."
1,Didn't like it!,This burger press makes very small hamburgers and not big enough for my liking. It's definitely not worth what I paid for it and the burgers don't pop out of the mold that easily.
1,ITEM DOES NOT WORK....,"Regretfully, I purchased the hamburger press... I used it one time.. after one washing i cannot get the red end cap to slip back on the press...it has swelled and will not go on.... i threw away the box it came in so now i am stuck with a PIECE OF JUNK.. I DO not RECOMMEND THAT YOU WASH THIS PRESS AS THEN YOU WONT BE ABLE TO USE IT AGAIN....I WILL BUY THE DUAL ALUMINUM PRESS FROM j.C. Penney.... its metal.....DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM IF YOU INTEND TO WASH THE RED CAP...I don't particularly like silicone burgers as this coating will come off in your burger... to sum it all up...ITS A PIECE OF JUNK"
1,You get what you pay for,"Not many good things about it.It will make a round hamburger, but not tight.It is made of some strange plastic (like a hard rubber) not ez clean.It makes a dip in the meat (thats cool) but the ram leaks meat around it."
5,The cable works fine.,The Sony Ericsson P990i Retractable Power Hot Sync and Charge USB Data Cable works fine. No problem at all.
5,Dreamweaver4 Bible,What else can be said except that Joe has done another masterful work at providing in depth documentation of DreamWeaver4's many features.Joe's books sit at arm's length and is used as a reference constantly.
4,A veterans review,"For a guy who was their from early July 50 to mid April 1951 was not really to much said about it and different outfits.It does start out like it was lots of space between front line outfits and we just keep pulling back, till we got to the river, and that was great a moth of not bathing in mid summer is ripe in any mans worldThen not much on us in No Korea or the start of another retreat.FOR THE EARLY GUY WANTING TO SEE THAT PART AGAIN I WOULD SAY SAVE YOUR MONEY"
2,The Big Picture Vol 1 : The Korean War,"Good quality of picture but too much propaganda on English commentary for the US Army. If you are in Army, you might like it."
5,Hinkley Atlantis Bronze,"We purchased these to replace dated fixtures on a ski chalet. Themultilevel roof lines indicated a more contemporary design for fixtures.These fit the bill and illuminate nicely without being glaring to neighbors.They are beautiful, sleek and we found them for an absurdly, low price."
1,Game Programming it is not...,Pre-ordered this book after reading editorial but was a waste of money.1. I'm half way through the book and not 1 like of DX code yet2. Majority of book is screen shots - I counted over 50 pages of screen shots showing the setup wizard for the various tools!3. Up to page 220 is simple tutorials for using the shareware tools: much better tutorials supplied in online help for the tools themselves.4. Another load of pages dedicated to showing up how to put together a VB Form.Don't buy it without previewing some of the content first.
3,It does NOT teach you DirectX,"The title of this book is kinda NOT true. This book has very little information about direct-x.BUT this does not make this a bad book. If you want to learn to make games with VB this might be the book for you. The book explains about 3d programs, music programs. It also has the builders own 3d lib and stuff. That is why I gave it three stars.Now for a book that really teaches VB-coders to work with Dirext-X."
1,A complete joke,"Do not buy this book, not even if you are a newcomer to DirectX. The topics that covers DirectX starts from page 213 and ends on page 254. The rest of this ""i wrote this just to make money"" book covers 3d programs, music editors and a 3rd party 3d engine. Read the DirectX SDK instead, it offers much more info than this book."
2,Now we know computer books also ship with bugs,"The first part of the book is a nice little tutorial on creating the different parts of a computer game. However, through the programming section of the book the author continually leaves out important lines of code that you need to make the samples work. Then when you dive into the source code that was provided on the CD he has changed the names of his variables and functions so that trying to find the error between your code and his extra difficult. If you are new to programming this can be extra frustrating. This is a perfect example of having someone write a book to cash in, without that person actually having the talent and determination that is need to put out a helpful and educational product."
1,"worthless, MISLEADING title, promotes software, useless","more like a prompo for other software packages like milkshake, etc., and pages of pictures of dialogs if you want to buy other software. don't know what the point of this book is, not a reference book, not a tutorial. here's the contents and comments.chapter 1: game programming overview.-- programmer, artist etc. so what else is new?chapter 2: the design docment.chapter 3: what language should you use? -- he's written another book on VB .chapter 4: Intro to milkshake 3D -- mostly pictures of dialog boxes in the program, should you buy it.chapter 5: Into to paintshop pro -- dittochapter 6. etcetc. Wont bore you with the details.if you want a reference or tutorial on directX or Direct3D this is not it. I can read more about DirectX, reading a few pages on the net. I dont usually take time to write reviews, but I waited so long (based on the title) that I was livid at the money I wasted."
5,Hope VB.NET Book Is This Good,"This is the second Crooks (sorry, that's his name) book that I've gotten. Also purchased a VB book and I see from the description that he is doing a VB.NET book. Looking forward to seeing it."
5,Would give it a Six if Possible!,"This is a great book. It covers everything about development including creating low poly models, music, sfx and then puts it into a final project. You also make a Half-Life model viewer and some other projects as well. I've read several other game programming books that were simply ""copies"" of the SDK info. This book takes a very good approach and allows a beginner or advanced programmer to benefit from it.This is a must have!"
2,Worst Of Mortician,"This is definitely Mortician's worst work. It comes packaged in a flimsy single case with a small Relapse Records catalog replacing any liner notes or lyrics.As for the music, this is a CD release of Mortician's first EP, with 17 (!) bonus tracks, culled from a demo and two live recordings. Considering that every song except for the title track is rerecorded on ""House By The Cemetery""; ""Hacked Up For Barbecue""; and ""Final Bloodbath Session"", there's not really much point to buying this release, unless you're curious as to what the band sounded like with live drums. Furthermore, the sound quality on this CD is absolutely atrocious. You won't be missing much if you pass this one up.For those of you who are curious, the movies sampled for this CD are ""Night Of The Living Dead (1968)""; ""The Shining""; and ""Phantasm II""."
2,P-C 7529,"A good router with reasonably smooth plunging action, but with a few problems that led me to trade it in for a Dewalt 625. The depth measurement rod/device is awkward and not as well designed as I would have expected. The overall power was much less than my old Sears 1 1/2HP router; the P-C was practically stalling out in routing oak, where the Sears was not hesitating. The collets and the edge guide did work well, the kit and case is quite nice, and my shop vac plugged into the dust port with just minor adjustments."
2,I can not believe this is P.C.,"I could not believe that the PC teck said that plunge routers all have play in the shaft. The right side has such play that you can tilt the router base by applying pressure to one side even when locked and he said this is normal! I have a RE600 Ryobi that is solid in all positions. I tested the DeWalt621 and with one post it was solid. The depth adjustment is also very hard to set, you have to turn it many revolutions to get it to adjust. The dust shield falls off easily. I returned it after one day."
2,Disappointing,"I have many PC products, and this is the worst of the lot. 7529 feels great in your hands, and the soft start is nice.But now the problems. The trigger lock takes a lot of getting used to. Can be very hard to lock. The knob on the front for locking the depth gauge is coming off. It's a plastic knob pressed onto a brass insert, and when you tighten the knob it pulls away from the insert. The electronic brake stopped working, and the height lock came loose. I've only used it a few times, and it seems to be falling apart!I've heard many of these same problems from fello woodworkers."
1,Porter Cable Router ?,"I have 9 routers in the shop, 5 of them are Porter Cables. Four of the PCs are used constantly, and are very reliable. This model sits on a shelf, non functional as a real expensive paper weight. It's been sent to PC for repairs 2 times, when it quit in the middle of another project I gave up on it and went and bought a Bosch. Even when it worked I thought the convoluted off/on switch was a pain."
4,Takes some getting used to,"When I first started using this router I was a little disappointed. The depth control is a little stubborn to operate but now that I'm used to it I don't mind. So far, I haven't had any of the switch related problems others have mentioned. I originally intended to use this router in my table but soon discovered it isn't really table friendly. I now have the PC 690 in my table and it works fine. Fortunately the 7529 and 690 have the same hole configuration so mounting it to my table was a cinch."
3,OK,"The router is great but I find that the brake system is failing already after only hours of use,other than that its a good tool,the soft start is great and adjustments are precise.I am a professional woodworker and longevity of use is a quality I must insist on."
1,PC-7529 is a loser,This is the second review on this router. This one is just the 7529 with carrying case and edge guide.This router will not stay in a fixed position. It works Ok as a plunger router where you hold it against the stop. It is NOT satisfactory for using on a router table or with a Leigh Dovetail Jig. Where depth of cut is most important.
2,Not the quality I expected.,"The 7529 worked ok in plunge mode although it was rather stiff and smooth plunging was a problem. However in shaper mode it was a big let down. As noted by another reviewer the handle power switch would not lock on, I also had to tape it, but worse was the micro adjuster. The adjusting knob is too close to the body and not shaped for other than working with the finger tips. I could not move the bit up as the weight of the inverted router was too great for my fingers to overcome. My old ELU router (now DeWalt and the worse for it) had a rod with a Tee handle which extended clear of the body. This arrangement was far easier."
1,Very disappointed!,"I was very disappointed with Porter Cable. The plunge mechanism sticks, the on button is hard to lock on for router table use, the depth gauge is extremely hard to use, and it is not compatible with most after-market accessories. Mine is sitting on a shelf. In its place is a DeWalt 621 plunge router. It is lighter, has a much better depth gauge and is just better all around. I love my DeWalt 621. I wish I had bought it first."
3,this is an OK router,"I bought it so that I could leave my DW621 in my router table - I built a custom insert for the rectangular base. I thought I couldn't go wrong buying this one. I liked the way it felt, and the fit-and finish of the tool. Then I used it. Like others, I felt like the thing was falling apart. At one point I was making a plunge cut and it just stopped, because the cap over the motor brush popped out. The trigger is awkward but I got used to my 621 so I don't hold that against them. The depth adjustment, however, is the cheesyest thing I ever saw. I expect more from a $[money]+ tool. Anyway, I decided to keep it but it is now mounted in the router table and I am using the 621 for all hand work, its a much better machine INMHO."
3,Porter Cable is supposed to mean quality???,"Overall I like this router, it's not too heavy, easy to move about, and it's Porter Cable so it should be tough. However, there are things that I don't like about it. 1. the plunge spring is so stiff you have to lean on it to make it go down. 2. The switch on the handle requires that your finger flip up a release, which seems to stick on when you want it to shut off, and not stick when you want it stay on. 3. The micro-adj. knob is set to low and close the body making it hard to turn. Last and most important is I've had my router just over a year and the soft start module just went out for the second time, which means it will not run!! And last time my router was in the shop for two weeks waiting for parts and this time I'm going to have to pay for the expensive module myself..."
2,Don't use this for a router table,"Porter Cable has a design flaw with the trigger locking switch. To use this in a router table, your must lock the trigger on and use a switch located on top of the router to turn it on. The problem is the switch lock breaks easily and the router will not function properly. I found this out the first time I used it in my table and sent it away to be fixed. After the fix, the repair lasted 20 minutes. I am now looking for another router to use in my table. I will only use the 7529 for hand held applications where I constantly hold down the trigger myself. Porter Cable should have a recall on this. I am not the only person with this problem. I posted my problem on a tool chat room and other woodworkers shared the same story. If you want to use this router for a router table, get another router. Save yourself the trouble."
1,Save your money,"I'm currently on my third one. All have had switches fail, my current one is hotwired bypassing the top rocker swich. PC said a year ago it would send me a new switch, still haven't seen it. If you use this in a router table the handle switch mechanisim will plug with sawdust, and will not work. All Three have had the collet lock break, and I have had Makita's version for four years (model 3612C) and its still going strong. By the way I own seven other routers and use them in my furniture shop."
3,"Lots of infos, not so organized","This is not a book you can read, it's a reference tool with infos about the major scholars, schools and commentaries. I expected maybe something more extensive, more pages, quite expensive the price. I agree about the bad organizations, no chapters, no arguments, only alphabetical chinese transliteration that make it messy."
5,it's not a toy--it's a charger,"I couldnt' give it any stars for being a toy as it is a charger. This is a charger for one of those 4 wheeler battery driven vehicles for kids. But it is exactly what I wanted and needed. When my boy got the package, he said, ""I wonder who sent this?"" and then he opened it up. His eyes got all big, and he said, ""It must be from Heavenly Father, because he knew I really needed this!"""
1,Poor product,"Received this charger new and ordered a new 12 volt battery for toy at the same time. Have tried charging the battery several times since receiving the charger, leaving it to charge one time for 48 hours. Charger were not charge the battery at all!!! Nothing!! Called Peg Perego back, and they want me to pay them $10 shipping and handling to replace their junk!!! I only paid $25 for the charger, why would i pay them another $10 to get another one!!!???? They sure dont stand behind their products, i have used it twice, didnt work either time, and now they want another $10 to replace what should have worked correctly in the first place????? What a ripoff!!"
4,Good Battery charger,This was a good battery charger. I lost the original one I had so it would have been helpful to have a better picture to see the battery connection.
3,chargem up,It's for sure you can't ride the john deere without charging it up. then away he goes. Over the hills and thru the woods to Gran's house I go. My little grandson just loves to ride his john deere.
3,Does the job.,This is our third charger in 4 years. They do the job but don't have a very long shelf life. They're a bit overpriced too.
5,works perfect,"The original charger for my son's PEG PERGO QUAD was broken. It wasn't broken due to a design flaw, but a rambunctious boy. I was cautiously optimistic when ordering this charger and it works perfect. No complaints and we've charged the quad a dozen or so times now."
1,Still have not received it?,"After two phone calls and four weeks, today I find out they have not shipped it. Gee 14th Century expertise, I'm impressed. The customer service guy had to walk to the warehouse and tell them to ship the invoice and product. Don't bother buying from these guys until thay hire a consultant to teach their warehouse guys how to read and ship off of an invoice. I should have just drove to Wallymart and bought it. Amazon needs to review how they select their fulfillment company's this gives them a bad name."
5,Very Tasty and A Good Heaty Meal When You Are On The Trail,"I've been eating these out on the trail for many years, all of the Mountain House Meals have been very good. I usually have the Eggs With Bacon for breakfast and one of their entrees for dinner. They are very handy, just add boiling water, close the seal and wait a few minutes. I usually eat them straight from the pouch so clean up is just washing a spoon/fork when I'm through. The empty pouch works great to put small pieces of trash in to pack it back out (I usually give it a rise so it doesn't start to smell before I get back). I suggest buying a variety and trying them at home, so you can see what you like before taking them out on the trail. My friend and I totally disagree about which one's are the best. I would recommend Mountain House Meals to anyone...."
4,Excellent,"This is one of those label comps that would be great for a young person just getting into 1960s psych underground music. You get a lot of bands who later became huge, Pink Floyd, and those that never did: Edgar Broughton Band.Buying is an unqualified GO! if you are new to any progressive beyond the obvious, but if you are a seasoned collector, look before you leap. Harvest had a great bench but not as deep as either Deram or, especially, Vertigo.If your eyes pop at the unknown bands here, take a minute. It might be worth spending your cash to check into those individual albums rather than diving for the comp. You'll deepen your collection, and get more music for your bank."
5,Great hunting tails,This book I believe told the stories of hunting in Africa with great zest for the hunt ant portrayed the stories truthfully.
4,So Many Ways to Die Once.,"From Lions to Snakes, Africa is a story of Life and Death and the Author brings to out the indifference and acceptance ofdying by the peoples of Wild Africa."
5,Great Socks!!,"My husband loves these socks. They are a little pricey however they are super soft and comfortable. My husband hates those skinny thin dress socks for work so these do a much better job, and since he seems to be in work clothes a lot his feet are always comfy!"
2,OK BUT UPDATE PROBLEMS,"I have used Tax Cut for several years and reasonably satisfied. But the 2004 edition has an error in the auto update software that causes ""UNEXPECTED ERROR"" flag when trying to download the update. The TaxCut web site acknowledges the error and lists cause as UNKNOWN. Wasted time disabling firewall, anti-virus, etc. with no resolution. The only solution is to download a full update from their web site which is 42 mb and takes 3 hours with a 56K modem. Imagine this when buying software to speed your tax preparation. A check of the internet shows others having this problem also. Apparently they did not do much quality testing of this product.Otherwise the software is similar to previous years."
1,"TaxCut should be called TaxHIKE!,","Last year, a bug in TaxCut caused by W2 to be entered twice in an e-filed return. Instead of getting a healthy refund, the IRS thought I owed them several thousand dollars in back taxes, penalty, and interest. Speaking of interest, HR Block showed NO interest in helping me with the problem that their bugware caused. It took me several months, several nasty letters from the IRS, and a long stream additional forms (not supported by TaxCut) to get the TaxCut problems straightened out.I'm giving this product one star only because I can't give it zero. I heartily advise you to do whatever you need to do to avoid this product and this company. Use TurboTax, calculate by hand, or hire a CPA, but do NOT trust TaxCut."
2,Pretty pathetic tale though funny in places.,"This book was something of a disappointment, especially after Fear of Flying and Fanny. The good points are some funny Jewish jokes and the author's commendable honesty. Her description of dating married men is also witty and she has a sharp eye for ludicrous self-deception (in others). However, on the subject of feminism I found her to be surprisingly self-pitying, and there was something uncannily shallow in her descriptions of her various husbands and other partners. The many descriptions of Italy verge on a glossy travel guide and quickly become tedious. Not a book which yields any insight of value."
3,Fear of Reading,"I read Fear of Flying many years ago, and it seems to me that this is just the same book rehashed.Ms. Jong spends way too much time trying to show us how clever she is, and dropping the names of every famous person she has ever met.The end result is that this book reads like a kind of blog. She makes many witty and very perceptive comments on the nature of relationships between the sexes, but comes across as a thoroughly obnoxious, self-absorbed individual whom one would NOT want to meet in real life.In the end one has to feel thoroughly sorry for the various men who have loved her and married her, and sympathize totally with those who have dumped her. It would be really interesting (though impossible) to get THEIR inputs on what they thought was going on."
1,Don't be fooled by fancy packaging,"Since I have two elementary aged children, I thought that this product was a good buy. The packaging opens up like a booklet to display samples of the activities, and they looked alright. Problem is, I can't even find them to run them. I have looked at games with no instructions that I cannot even figure out. Worse still, some of my cd roms say that they are demo versions only, and, if purchased, are illegal copies. I paid $40 at Best Buy! I will only buy familiar titles like Jump Start in the future."
1,Absolute garbage,"Can only run if logged in as an administrator.Have to install 1 CD at a time, cannot control installation paths.No user manual, no help files.Cannot set levels.Would rate as 0 stars if option was available."
1,Worthless,"I agree with another reviewer who said they'd give this program 0 stars of possible. I got a screen on the math program that told me it was a demo copy and if I saw that screen, it meant I'd purchased an illegal copy. What? I bought it from Sam's Club!! It also made my new computer freeze up, and the history section was awful... all it did was give a list of events or inventions and says to list them in chronological order. And the science program teaches only about earthworms, moths, and butterflies.Total waste of money. I had to drive 20 miles back to Sam's Club and demand my money back."
3,Good for the price (20 bucks),"My son loves this, he is only 5 and a half years old. Some of the simple stuff is pretty repetitive - but he can skip through the easy stuff quite fast while still having fun. He found the Foreign languages interesting, ""English?"", Spanish and Chinese. Math is quite difficult - but he still manages to learn new concepts - they are explained in some detail. He doesn't like the encyclopedia, but I think that he will like it when he is a bit older.We got this package for 20 dollars - well worth it for 9 CD-roms and the hours of study fun. My son has even learned to install the software himself, he loves discovering the new stuff on each of the CD-roms. Yes there are patches to download from the support website for one of the CDs - I had no problems installing the fix/patch.OK - this software isn't as polished as a Disney CD-ROM or DVD - still I wouldn't describe it as worthless."
5,Rawk!!!,"Tora! Tora! Torrance! is Tearing, Tearing Tearing this shtuff up! Hot guitars, hot drums, hot music in general. Do you ever just want to rock out, play air guitar, and sing at the top of your lungs? Well then hot damn, this is the album to do it to! Rock and roll at it's finest, Tora Tora Torrance puts out some intese music, an investment in this record is an a major contribution to the reintroduction of kick ass music."
5,Endlessly entertaining,"This is very probably my favorite Feeling B album. It offers an incredible journey through all of what is Feeling B. It has songs that are pure and concentrated fun, and also some songs that are a little more serious. And yet, none of the tracks feel out of place. The music is very well done, and the lyrics are gripping and thought provoking. It's just what what you'd expect from the talents of Flake and Paul (from Rammstein), with the addition of a really hilarious singer."
5,nice ride,Shocks are shocks but these perform very well. Was a direct fit and seem to have a smooth ride. Would recommend KYB shocks.
3,Great product...really small amounts,"I bought this for my 2 year old who loves to draw on her easel. I wanted to get a variety of colors, and test out the paint before buying the large containers available. The paint is great...washes right off. I have no fear that it would stain something. HOWEVER, this is not a value. I will be buying the large individual crayola paints for her going forward, like this oneCrayola Artista II Washable Tempera Paint 16oz Blue"
3,Like it,"Good quality, it was my 3 yr old's favorite gift of the day. Two things to take note of: they are small! I didn't notice the size -- I'm not sure how long they will last. Also, I wish there was a different type of dispenser at the top. They are made for smaller children, but the large opening at the top is begging for a massive mess."
1,very strong odor,I totally agree with other reviewer saying it has very strong odor.Even though it says non toxic but it smelled so bad that the whole room was filled with toxic smell and gave me a headache.not so good for little ones.
3,Messy when delivered,There was pain crusted around the cap when I got this as if it had already been opened. Other than this the paint works well. It is also thick enough so it doesn't drip off paint brushes and make a mess with little artists.
5,The last of old school Spanish pop ?,"This album has alot of great songs. Most of the are just fun, and then you have your hits, like ""mirame a los ojos"" and ""aunque muera por ti"" witch really shine. But the current pop scene has left these songs behind with more digital sounds, but this is still a great album that will make you happy and bob your head a bit."
5,It is their best cd I can't stop listening,"I have been listening to this cd since ""mi pequena traviesa"" started on univision. this is their best cd with popular music that everyone likes."
2,Poor Build Quality - Otherwise a Good Solution,"I have had this system for more than two years. Overall it is good (much better range and voice quality than a 2-line Siemens Giga set I have at home). It lacks some features, but compared to what is available in this price range it is a good package.Beware that the number one on the handset's keypad seems to stop working not long after warranty expires. It has happened on all four of my handsets, and it is happening again on one of the refurbished replacements (only 90 days warranty) for which Panasonic charges about $80 (if you ship your broken one to them). Others here have noted the same problem. I like Panasonic phones, but this quality issue would stop me from buying this system again."
1,-2 STARS WORST $600.00 INVESTMENT EVER!!!!,"Our office has had this system for two weeks. One handset has already gone bad and another keeps giving a message to move closer to the base unit. Funny thing is, you can be within a foot of the base unit and no reception. We are going to try the Motorola MD681 for half the price of the Panasonic. I'll Let you know about that later."
2,Panasonic Customer Service NFG,"Panasonic customer service makes this system not worth the trouble. Using extension handset with a headset, makes handset eventually think that a headset is connected even when it is not. Panasonic says that I am the only person this happened to (happened to four different handsets). If you need 2 handsets, you better buy 4. If you like this unit- Buy mine! I always bought Panasonic phones, will never buy Panasonic anything!"
2,Bad handsets a major problem,"We have used this system in a business for almost two years. Nearly every handset we have purchased is defective out of the box or shortly thereafter. The major problem is poor sound -- you can hardly hear the caller. With other units, the caller can't hear you. Out of the five handsets we're currently using (all out of warranty) one is good, three are so-so, and one is very bad. We're hoping to find an alternative, but need at least three lines."
3,Beware of use near wi-fi hot spots!,"We had this system for a few months and it worked great, until... Starbucks turned on their wi-fi system. The handsets cannot register to the base any longer. We are currently trying to figure out if we can return or trade the product for something that is not affected in the 802.11b frequency range."
4,The problems are real but can be overcome,"I have this system for our home, where my husband and I each run our own small businesses and also have the home phone -- we needed a system that could handle so many phone lines without having to have 3 separate phones at each location in our 3 story home. We have had the problems with the number 1 key like others have, but there is a company, Barclay Enterprises, [...], that will fix the handset with a lifetime warranty, so no need to completely replace. I found out the static on the handsets could be eliminated by giving the base unit sharp (but gentle) raps on the desktop until I got it to go away. So far, so good. I agree with others that we should not have to put up with this s__t, but for the money, this is still a great system that works well for our needs for much less money than a true professional multi-line system."
1,Poor dealer,I am waiting for 2 weeks for this phone and still has not been shipped=- what's the matter with this company? So I really cannot rate the product.
1,Dies just after end of warenty,"I bought this system about 16 months ago and thought it was great. But after about 6 months one of the remotes would not hold charge for very long and then the sound quality went down. It was replaced under waranty. Now that the waranty is up we are down to one out of five phones working. Replacing battery does nothing to help. They first start to not hold charge and then with in four weeks the sound is so bad they are usless.After spending [alot of money] the response from Panasonic was - ""we can sell you replacement extensions.""I now skip right past anything with the Panasonic name on it."
2,Battery life weak and important feature missing...,"Battery life rated at 8 hours talk time on Panasonic web site but believe me, it's closer to 2 hours. We've had to switch handsets in mid conversation more times than we should. Also, when talking on the phone, incoming calls are not put into voice mail automatically, they are ignored. Such an obvious feature overlooked (if it is possible, we can't find it explained anywhere in the manual). Also, when listening to messages, you can not save the message on the base unit, you have to transfer it to a handset/mailbox or lose it. Best feature is that you only need one phone jack for 8 handsets, you can put the handsets anywhere you want (near an electrical outlet). Handsets not very comfortable for long conversations. Overall, we wished we'd waited for shortcomings to be worked out. Lots of reasons to buy, these are some reasons to wait or look elsewhere."
3,Starting to fail,"I have had this system since 2001. It is now starting to slowly fail. Hums, caller ID displays are scrambled. Range is getting bad. Extentions failing. I guess it's just getting old. Used in in home and detached office 200 feet away. Worked well for 7 years, but I guess that's all that can be expected with products today. It should have had music on hold, that was a design mistake from the start."
1,Does not even deserve the one star!,We use this product where I work. We have 7 Cordless phones and 1 base. All of the phones have a lot of static in them now. We have trouble with customers being able to hear us and visa versa. Also on all of the cordless phones the 1's are no longer working! The 2 on three of the phones is starting to go. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT AT ALL!
1,"Base OK, Handsets Rotten -- DO NOT BUY",We bought this phone for our small office. The base is fantastic but we had to replace one handset right out of the box. Sound quality on the handsets is HORRIBLE. You can barely hear people and people have said they can't hear us. Save your money!! Buy something else!!!
1,Conf Calling is not good - No Do Not Disturb or Mute Button,This phone is disappointing at best. I sent it back within a week. Say you don't want to use the automated attendent because you have a voice mail system set-up already. You are on a conf call and want to put the phone on do not disturb so the callers on the line with you don't hear the other line ring. There is no Do Not Disturb button - are you kidding me! Then you are on a conf call and want to work in the background or talk to someone in your office while listening in on the call and find there is no mute button. Don't buy this phone. Even if you did want to use the automated attendent it's a pain to set-up. I also could not get the first line to ring but the other lines did and were set-up the same way. There are not many alternatives for four line phones with cordless handsets but this phone will frustrate the heck out of you and it is not cheap $400+.
3,a funny song,"I ran across this song on the Internet, and it's kind of funny. It is a techno-euro-pop anti-cell phone song (the video clips I've seen made it much funnier). A great dance tune! I hope this song catches on here in the USA."
3,"OK, wouldn't tell my friends to get it","I read a poem or two from this book each night at bed time to my 12 and 6 year old. Many of the poems are quite negative towards school. I prefer to teach my child that school is a good thing and so far they really love school. There is one poem that is very touching about a child's friend dying. Not really appropriate for the 6 year old but it's good to cover these topics as it is part of life.It is an OK book of poems, but I really wouldn't tell my friends to rush out and buy it."
4,An interesting set of alternate military scenarios,"In this book, part of an alternate history series from Greenhill books, ten military historians describe how Japanese campaigns in World War Two might have had different outcomes. Scenarios addressed range from the Russo-Japanese front to attacks on California and the Japanese conquest of India. Each chapter ends with a section entitled The Reality for contrast. The editor deserves congratulations for maintaining a high level of consistency among papers by different authors, generally avoiding overlap or duplication. The only exception is the last chapter (on the invasion of Japan's home islands), which is awkwardly and unconvincingly cast as as a lecture with questions and answers. The book includes maps of varying quality and a section of photographs from the Pacific war. Rising Sun Victorious, which includes detailed descriptions of military campaigns and battles, is for readers with a serious interest in military history."
3,Great idea... not all the authors followed through.,"While some of the stories were awsome, I have 2 warnings.1.) I like literature, but this book can be very technical, it was written by Pro-military writers, so be prepared to be in that genre.2.) I bought the book to see the ""Rising Sun Victorious"", but a few of the stories were more like... 'why it would have taken the Americans a couple of extra weeks to win.' Or 'how this battle the American won, wasn't really important, and if the Japanese did win, it wouldn't have mattered.'I would have liked to see more of the sories from Japanese writers who may have had a different perspective on what actions they could have taken. Otherwise, some of the stories are fascinating."
4,An enjoyable read,"I found this book to be quite interesting. Most of the major turning points of the Pacific War are dealt with in a light that gives Japan the edge. One or two of the stories are just too far out. This is not the fault of the fictional Japanese, but of the authors who sometimes place a convenient spy here or your odd task force there, where there was not and could not have been in the war. Also slightly distracting is was appears at first glance to be a sloppy editing job i.e. three or more ways to spell Admiral Yamamoto Isoroku's name. The price, in retrospect, seems a bit prohibitive as well, but overall it is a very interesting book for any student of Japan, military history, or wargamer."
3,A different possible outcome?,A book full of what if's. Basically it covers what may have happened if different decisions on key points had led to different outcomes. Like what if the Japanese had attacked Pearl Harbor again & destroyed the oil storage tanks & repair facilities. The fleet would have had to retreat to the west coast. Leaving all kinds of possibilities open. What if the U.S. had lost the battle of Coral Sea & Midway & all of the US carriers in those battles had been sunk. Oppening up another group of possiblities. Get the picture. This is basically what the book is about. Other reviewers have gone into deep details into some of these possibilities. So I don't feel I need to bore you by covering them again. I guess when it comes to alternate history I can't get very into it.
5,Another Option,"I would like to check with the experts that developed these scenarios to see if another option could be established. This new option is a variation of Germany's use of Russians to topple Stalin. The Japanese develope a clique of anti-Chiang Kaishek Chinese to establish a united China allied with Japan, not a vassal state. I enjoyed this book and the companion book on ways Hitler could have won the war."
3,Weaker Entry,"Just to correct another reviewer, Peter Tsouras didn't just edited this book he also contributed 1 of the 10 stories contained. I read and enjoyed Third Reich Victorious and have Dixie Victorious waiting to be read. The problem with Rising Sun is that the stories really don't contain a victorious Japan scenario. Most stories within are slightly different paths in history with the same Japanese defeat at the end. Sometimes defeat comes with better terms for them other than unconditional surrender, but there is no outright victory for Japan in this book. It certainly makes it more historically accurate since anyone with detailed knowledge of WWII history will realize that based on manpower, logistics and vital supplies, Japan could not conquer and hold all that they desired. This book does raise interesting scenarios such as war with the Soviets, invasions of India and Australia, and stronger follow ups to the attack on Pearl Harbor."
2,Wait for the second edition,"I bought this book based on the positive reviews and I have the following complaints:1) The writing style is extremely poor and the book is full of grammatical errors.2) Some statements are absolutely false because errors were missed during editing. (See 2nd last paragraph of page 22).2.) The code snippets are often incorrect or sloppy. (e.g.) snippet may contain a ""catch"" statement with no corresponding ""try"".Overall this book compares very unfavourably to the Java 2D book in the Sun series even though that book is becoming somewhat dated."
4,Excellent Resource,"This is an excellent resource for imaging development with Java and an altogther beautiful book complete with glossy, color pages. The only downside to this text is that there seems to be a new imaging API every week in the Java world. Even still, this is a great source to help you get started."
4,great gift,"nice gift idea for someone who you don't know what to get, invite someone out for a hike or a beach trip."
1,Why haven't I received this book yet?,"I ordered this book on Sept.7. It is now Oct.10 and it still hasn't arrived, so my review is not going to be very positive in respect to customer service."
2,Mild psychothriller not worth the time,"Insincere film starring Victoria Principal as a woman obsessed with protecting her daughter from a child molester. Nothing special here, though young Danielle Harris is good as Principals daughter. Originally released as a made for television film ""Don't Touch My Daughter"" in 1991. Based on a novel by Marjorie Dorner."
5,A must have.,"Have you ever be transformed into a different time and place by music? Well, this album will take you to a wonderful place in your mind. I call it my dream vacation music. When I listen to this amazing artist play, I just want to be sitting on the sand, watching the waves crash down, while I drink my mai tai. Govi mixes sounds of Spain and the Carabian with utilizing guitars and wind instraments. If you like flameco, steel drums, flutes, and classical guitar styles, then you'll love this album."
4,passion & grace,"Am very pleased with the C D"" Passion and Grace ' . It is the seconded C D I have of Govi's work and I like both ."
3,VPN,This is the best thing avalible in the world today to connect to the network through the internet and transfer the secure data over the net
2,Doesn't Fit Standard Binder,"At first glance, I thought this product would be the perfect choice for my coupon binder. Once I got it all assembled, however, it proved to be no help at all. The tabs don't stick out far enough to be seen on the edges. Also, the tabs themselves tend to get ""hung up"" on the pages next to them. I was very disappointed with this product and ended up having to throw it away."
2,Not practical,"These look good in the package but are ultimately victims of style over substance. Because of the curved edges, there's very little room in the tab area that peeks out from the side to type anything."
2,Bad labelling arrangement,The labels don't fit the tabs nicely and the template doesn't align them quite right. You also can't read the labels from the back. These are pretty but the problems with the labels make the creatively rounded edges more of a hassle than they are worth - stick with the more traditional rectangle-label model instead.
5,Excellent Tool for Contractors,"This is a very handly addition to any contractors tool selection. I find it very useful in demolition work where the corded version gets in the way or it is not practical to run the extension cord. Overhead, outdoors, and quick demo cuts are the best use for this tool. (It also comes in handy for trimming trees around the yard.) For all-day, extended duration demolition work you better either run the cord or buy some extra batteries. Overall, this is a good tool to have available on a jobsite."
4,Cordless recip saw,"The Dewalt recip saw really fills the bill for me. No cordless tool is a match for its 120Vac corded counter part for power or price provided there is a handy place to plug it in. For those other places, the Dewalt cordless tools come in very handy. I love to use mine where a cord is a nuisance or just plain dangerous. Soffits,attics, and crawl spaces come to mind. The recip saw has plenty of power and has good balance. It works best when the blade is matched to the type of material being sawed. I got the blade assortment pack too. It sucks the power out of a battey pack pretty fast, but no faster than any other saw. All saws use a lot of power when compared to a drill or a flashlight."
5,A beautiful tribute to my beloved country,This book is wonderful for children and adults alike. Ted Harrison's beautiful paintings bring to life the words to the national anthem of Canada and refect my glorious country in all it's majesty. A must-have for anyone who loves Canada!
4,Great Images from an Inspiring Artist,"I love to introduce my middle school art students to interesting artists. Ted Harrison is one of my favorites. His colorful, stylistic images of the Yukon are inspiring. Students can see how he effectively uses tints (white added to a color), an idea they can use in their own work. This encourages them to do some color mixing."
2,"Informative, but not realistic","This book starts out by touching on many of the topics faced by families who have children with disabilities. It addresses old myths about institutionalization and presents a much more encouraging view of the future for children with special needs. However, the book then takes on a mythical, almost Disney-like point of view, as almost everyone in the book is very wealthy, and a girl with severe autism is ""cured"" by a very traumatic incident. I'm not sure of the intended audience for the book, but it does need a parental warning that it contains graphic descriptions of violence, discussions of sexual activity and suicide."
3,Not politically correct but kind of funny,The movie is sort of cute but it has some off color humor about death and the aunt that is a little off putting. Other than that it's a cute movie to watch if you're bored. It's set in New York City but it takes place almost entirely in the apartment building. Melissa Joan Hart and Carmen Electra are fun to watch. The outrageous characters make the movie fun and different.
1,Awful and dangerous,This could have been made in 1975; it ignores the real impact of divorce on children's lives and belittles there emotions. The father is reduced to only having phone contact with the little girl and isn't even at the child's birthday party. This is a pollyanna story designed to make adults feel better about themselves not genuinely help children.
5,One of the most amazing bands I ever heard,"This album has it all emotion, feeling, belief... When i first heard this band I swear I didnt stop listening to them for at least a month. The Beautiful Mistake has created a master piece. I definately recomend this album to anyone who can appreciate good wholesome quality screamo."
2,No where near as good as Thrice...,"I can't believe I've been hearing all these good things about this band, because they just aren't that good. They sound just like every other band like it, but without the edge. They are, just like another reviewer said...blah. Very boring. Guitar playing is average, singing is average, songs in general are average. Theres nothing special here. No where near as polished and artistic as Thrice, or even Thursday, who they seemed to be trying to sound like."
2,Blah blah blah,"Okay, these guys are the epitome of the post-emo cliche band. What seperates this band from fricking Noise Ratchet, or Taking Back Sunday, or any of those ... bands. Someone left this disc in my car and I played it once because I was curious, and again because I wanted to like it because they're local guys. They don't suck, its just boring. If your going to try and be serious, do it right, (Bright Eyes, Cursive), or you can go the other way and just have fun (Foo Fighters, Jimmy Eat World) you can't fake it and sadly this and many bands do."
4,AN INTERESTING TAKE,"An interesting take on two very different men that a woman loved; her husband and her lover. I found the arguments between the two men to be interesting. The big twist at the end helped push this movie up a bit, too, and, it was nice to see Banderas in a movie again. A good chunk of this movie follows the jealousy streak so about 90% of us can probably relate. WHEN WATCHED: 10/22/2010; MY GRADE: B."
1,WASTE NO BUY DRAMA,"Don't waste your money buying this movie, please.I don't usually like to TELL ALL but this movie is ridiculous!!This MAN had a so-called PERFECT marriage. His wife DIES and then decides to leave him clues, messages and innuendos that she was CHEATING not just CHEATING but IN LOVE with someone else.DAMN!!How HARSH can you get!! This came from a marriage without provocation. It's like IN YOUR FACE. Personally, if you ever did this in REAL LIFE, it would definitely be a message letting your committed husband KNOW that you REALLY REALLY DESPISED HIM. Even her daughter found out.What a ^&&(*)*(&INB;&(*KN_)&%!!!RENT ONLY if you must, I made the mistake of buying and it is a total waste for me unless I want to show JUST how CRUEL a WOMAN can be!! ...................the horror!!"
3,"Great talent, but...","I read the story on which it was based (in German). The movie takes more than a few liberties with the book. At the same time, if you have not read the book, you might not grasp the significance of what is going on at times."
1,a waste of time,"This movie sucks!!!!!! SPOILER ALERT First we see some half baked foreshadowing from Peter's (Liam Neeson)wife about ""Has he ever wanted to sleep with someone else"" .Then she dissapears. Then he tracks down her adulterous boyfriend (Ralph pronounced some odd way I refuse to take the time to remember). Then some stupid stuff about chess. Then we find out the cosmopoliton boyfriend is a janitor. Then Peter gives him money to have a party because I suppose Ralph (pronounced that stupid waY AGAIN) Is the only one that understands her. The ending is even more moronic. Peter and his daughter remarking ABOUT what a wonderful woman Lisa (the adulterous wife) was.END OF SPOILER ALERT I only payed $1.00 to watch this movie but I feel I lost an hour and a half of my life which I'll never get back."
1,I wish I could give lower than One star,"This movie is a complete disaster, and not recommended for people, who are on antidepressant pills.Very slow start, with memory flashes makes this movie dragging and very slow. Movies supposed to be entertaining even if they are horror.But this script is a total waste. Only few people got out of this movie, and they are the actors, who got paid well for their great acting.I wonder if they saw the final edit, and I wonder what was their opinion."
2,weak... and confusing...,"The DVD box says the wife disappeared, but toward the end of the story we learn from the husband that the wife is dead. The story is weak and confusing. About the only thing worth seeing are the gorgeous sets and scenery in Milan...and London's magnificent St. Pancras train station at The End."
2,DISAPPOINTING,"I am a huge fan of Laura Linney who can light up the screen with just a look. Liam Neeson usually adds a touch of elegance to his roles. And Antonio Banderas makes a great Puss-in-Boots.Alas they can't rescue this truly drab soap opera. Even Lifetime's cookie-cutter TV movies are more involving. Add dull direction and a ridiculous script, you get a sadly disappointing clunker."
2,Question,"Early in the movie before he received the Lake Como note, Peter takes women's clothing and gives them to his daughter along with what appears to be sheets, blankets, etc. Whose clothes does he give his daughter? Are the sheets, etc. from the bed he shared with his wife? I thought when his wife left, Peter and her were still on good terms. LATER: Now having watched the movie through to the end, I withdraw my question. I don't remember ever being this confused about a movie. BTW, poor George ..."
2,Bad Blu-ray in Brasil ...,"The Blu-ray released here in Brasil by California Filmes is bad !!! The format is 1.85:1, the PQ is bad, they took out the DTS HD audio ...The movie itself is bat too!!!"
1,A cheat of a movie,"I love Liam Neeson, and enjoy the other key actors. The problem is not in their acting--it's in the script. I don't want to give the movie away, so briefly put: this film isn't about what it claims to be about, and by the time you realize this after a key twist, you've already watched the whole thing. Utter deception. Failure. Watch something else."
1,RUBBISH,"Here are six terrific truths about time:Firstly: Nobody can manage time. But you can manage those things that take up your time.Secondly: Time is expensive. As a matter of fact, 80 percent of our day is spent on those things or those people that only bring us two percent of our results.Thirdly: Time is perishable. It cannot be saved for later use.Fourthly: Time is measurable. Everybody has the same amount of time...pauper or king. It is not how much time you have; it is how much you use.Fifthly: Time is irreplaceable. We never make back time once it is gone.Sixthly: Time is a priority. You have enough time for anything in the world, so long as it ranks high enough among your priorities.Lewis TIMBERLAKE"
4,Pleasantly surprised,"Being a huge Laura Linney fan and never having seen this film in the theatre, I decided I needed to own ""The Other Man"". I didn't know what to expect but with stars like Linney, Neeson and Bondaris I was sure it was going to be great. What I found was a film with nuanced performances and an unpredictable story line. It is a tale of deceit, love, revenge and forgiveness. The story unwinds slowly and has surprising twists, however, I found the ending somewhat trite, thus only four stars."
4,Magnificent,"Imagine yourself as the spouse of someone you thought you loved or just took for granted. She dies. In grief, you sleep on her side of the bed, smell her clothes and shoes, rub her clothes against your face, and try to make believe she's still with you. You go through all kinds of emotions and then you find her laptop. Filled with secrets. She had an unknown male in her life. How dare she! How dare he! And the story is told. Imagine you are this widower. How would you react? What would you do? This is what the story is about. It wasn't until the next day that I realized this was indeed a very good movie and shed some tears. Laura Linney, Antonio Banderas, and Liam Neeson. Actors extrodinaire. One of those rare movies I will watch again."
3,Mildly disappointed,"My older Panasonic was a champ, and I especially liked the LONG shelf life - rarely needed recharging.My new one works fine but the sound is kinda noisy and not really clear. Defective? I don't know. It works just well enough that I probably won't bother to return it.Wish it was better."
5,So many colors!,my kids love that they can choose from different colors and be able to paint all they want! Super happy that we got this!
4,"Great Paint, Just not Enough of it","This is great ""kid paint"" since it's washable and beautifully pigmented, but the small jars it's packaged in make it difficult to use. I'm looking for a cap with a dispenser tip (from a bottle of glue, perhaps) that will fit these bottles. I've also thought about eyedroppers and syringes to make dispensing a small amount of paint easier, but both of those options don't seem practical."
1,This is not a face paint and coming up in the search as a face paint,It is not regulated for use to be used on faces.This product is not a cosmetic and should not be used on the face. That is different that being regulated by the fda for safety on the skin.I'm starting a public awareness campaign on the safe application of face paint and temporary tatoos to avoid impetigo and lice and ring worm.[...]
3,Wear a smock!,"As there is nothing ""washable"" about these paints. I just bleached a white outfit that has red splotches all over it from them, to no avail. It's ruined. Be very careful not to get this on clothing or have your children wear old clothes when painting."
2,Non-washable paints,"This ruined 2 pairs of my girls pants, lucky they had no shirts on. I tried washing multiple time and even washed them right away after they finished painting and now the pants are stained with paint."
4,Washes off easy,"Doesn't smell bad, comes off skin easyThough we used it on canvas and it can be rubbed off, doesnt necessarily stick"
4,Good Value!,My daughter loves these paints. I love how it is more colors for less money!Can use fingers or paint brush.
3,I am not using it- was a gift,Since I am not using it- was a gift for my neices so I assume they liked this product. :)
5,Perfect Toy!!!,Bought this for a our special needs 2 year old... it is wonderful for helping work with his therapist on teaching him sigh language.
4,They are really easy to wash andy vivid colors,"My daughter loves these bottle much. Their colors are also bright and easy to use. HOwever, the smell is strange. I don't know if it's bottle smell or liquid smell."
2,Interesting but...,"This book is not really a guide book. It certainly gives infotmation about gay life and venues in the main countries of South East Asia. It's probably the first book of its kind about this part of the world. And that's already a good reason to buy it. But you must know that most of the book is made out of Internet pages prints. You get some info but also many links, most of which are incomplete. Some travellers comments included are over 2 years old. And after browsing the book, you feel like to go online to get fresh news..."
3,Good DVD,"I was kind of disappointed with this DVD; it has some good songs, but just a few. Most of them are not good."
2,good timin,This dvd has the songs you remember as a teenager during this era. All the wilson brothers are together along with mike love. This dvd gives you a good feeling and can be watched time and time again. The dts sound is great and the picture quality is good.
1,DRUGGED OLD MEN TRYING TO RELIVE THEIR YOUTH,"I don't know why I expected to see the beach boys in their 1970's glory, but this video was a total disappointment. Instead of hearing their fine harmony, all I heard was noise as each one tried to ""jam"" with their brash input. Don't waste your money unless you were a fan in the 60's, drug out both then and now, and are trying to relive your experience.I might suggest the BEEGEES' One Night Only video that shows them BETTER than they were in the 70's!"
2,way too old,"these guys are way too old to be playing, i bought the dvd thinking it was in their younger years,they have no buisness playing, and all had beards wich made them look like old hippies!gross!"
2,The Beach Boys-Good Timing-1980 DVD,I was very excited to find a DVD of the Beach Boys but found the sound quality to be very bad. The picture was also on the grainy side. I hope someone puts together another Beach Boys DVD of the early years and improves the sound quility.
2,Image a bit blurry,Imagine not as clear as it should be. I guess the video was taken in the 80s so it couldn't keep up w/ today's technology.
5,experience of a lifetime,Too beautiful for words. I cried. I can't understand what power it is that comes from voices in harmony. A truly spiritual experience. I could only watch the first five songs and I was overwhelmed. I'm saving the rest for another day.
4,What you need to know about date rape!,"You're a Christian with high moral standards, being careful to always try to date nice people and you're even careful around strangers. Think it can't or won't happen to you? Consider that a rape occurs every 6 minutes in the US and a staggering 84 % knew their attacker! This book provides what you need to know about preventing data rape and how to recover if you or a friend have become a victim. This is a small but concise & powerful book that walks you thru the life of a Christian young lady confronted by her boyfriend on a date, to rape. Explains what date rape is & how it can happen to you even though careful, how you can help prevent it, what to do if you are a rape victim and how to recover from it. A good book for every woman, her family & friends, and yes, even her boyfriend, because ""Yes, it can happen to you! (Taken from back cover for lack of any other reviews)"
3,pnansonic handset,The handsets have to be replaced every year or two due to various malfunctions but the system remains a reasonable option as it's one of the few multi-phoneline cordless systems on the market in this price range. I've had my system for 6 years.
1,Terrible product,"I bought this phone through Amazon(4 lines system) for 2 years. (warranty is 1 year)after 1st year, the wireless handsets start to have a loud noise. I tried to call Panasonic customer service, no one answer the call. I left a message, no one call back. I tried the internet, and sent out tons of emails, no one answer.DO NOT buy this product!!"
2,Unreliable handsets,"After multiple positive experiences with Panasonic phones, I purchased a KTXGA400 system with four handsets. I have NEVER been this disappointed with Panasonic and can't imagine purchasing another phone system from them again. At this time (the system is 3 years old), only 1 of the 4 handsets can dial out without difficulty. The keypads simply fail.A very poor purchase decission on my part."
2,1 key fails,"After spending hundreds of dollars on this phone system, I'm in the market again. What a waste of time and money."
2,The number 1 on the keypad stops working.,"The number 1 on the keypad stops working. And it does so right after the warranty expires. I have 4 handsets, had to replace 2 (about $80 each after warranty), now I need to replace the other two, plus one of the replacements started doing the same (after the 90 days warranty. Otherwise (when it works) a decent system, way better sound and range than Siemens. Draw your own conclusions."
3,Decent but still some problems,"The first batteries had issues and did not hold their charge. Now, after 1 year, the 1 button won't push, so always trying to find a different phone that the 1 does work on. They have worked pretty decent for the past year, but they are really starting to fall apart. I guess they are too expensive to not work perfectly for a while, kind of a disappointment."
3,decent system,"this system is decent. we use it in our small business (5 desks) and it does the job. the handsets are solid, the system itself has some limitations (no personal greeting when an extension is busy) that keep it from being ideal. but it works and runs our small business fine."
4,Best 4-line phone out there,"I bought this for my home office - we have 2 home lines, a fax/dsl and a business line. This phone pretty much does it all - you can answer each line with a different outgoing message, set up mail boxes for different people, and even have different lines ring on different handsets, or not ring at all (i.e. the fax). The range is very good (I can usually get it to go about 400 feet outdoors in a suburban neighborhood). The handsets are pretty much the same size as the Panasonic 2.4mHz standard. Battery life seems fine.My biggest peeve is that you can't use 2 handsets on the same line at the same time (I guess that is what the extension is for) and that one of the four handsets we got refuses to work properly - something with the battery, but Panasonic has been pretty helpful."
1,Big Trouble with Panasonic Phones!,"We have 7 handset units in total in my business. The #1 key stopped working after about 2 years on three (3) of them so far, which renderes the phone pretty much useless!Customer service is awful, they won't do anything, because the phones are beyond their 1 year warranty!Beware of this product and other Panasonic phones!I have a similar phone system from Panasonic at home, where not only key 1 stopped working, but almost all number keys; I had to replace it..."
1,Defective handsets,"We are having the same problem as most of the other reviewers. The #1 button stops working, so dialing becomes impossible. Panasonic's response is to have the customer pay $90 to fix each handset, and since it's a multi line phone system, there are multiple handsets involved. Just inputting the model number in an internet search engine finds similar complaints across the web. If I hadn't found such an overwhelming number of complaints, I would have assumed it was simply my unit and had no problem paying for the repairs. But this defect is widespread, and Panasonic should be responsible for their defective item."
2,Unreliable,"I have 4 of these with the base and currently three are dead. One just came back from repair and died again within a week. When this system works, it is wonderful. But with a 90 day warranty on the handsets, I am going broke replacing them."
3,Great system... but sound is a bit low and/or echo-ey,"The title of the review says it all really. The system consistently works well. It handles 4 phone lines and is full of features. The only issue and it is a major one, is that the sound quality is very often (not always, not every call) very low/quiet and/or echo sounding. It is very difficult to hear a caller and it made my business seem a bit unprofessional. Luckily we moved offices within a few months and I got a great deal on a PBX from a friend in the business for about $1000. I got all the phones/phonesets for free otherwise that would have been another $200-$300 per set."
1,Panasonic should be ashamed of themselves!,I bought the Panasonic 4 line 400B system when it was a fairly new item and paid almost $500. Loved the base station and the range on the phone was really good only to find that the #1 button on the handset keypad stopped working in a short time. Panasonic wouldn't stand behind the defective product and eventually pulled the item leaving everyone who purchased this system in a lurch. Shortly afterwards replacement were only available from 3rd party dealers and most were $300 for a single hand set refurbished. I will think long and hard before every purchasing another Panasonic product considering their obvious disregard for treating their customers fairly.
2,Reconstructed and barely useable,"This reconstructed phone instrument barely works when you press the number ""1""- a common problem that occurs after the phone has been in use for a while. However, it should not have been sent out if it doesn't work perfectly."
3,Great product for small business except for the #1 button,"Our family has two self-employed persons in the household and this multi-line system is wonderful, until the #1 button fails! We are near five years in some heavy use at this point. The #1 button and has started the #4 malfunction as well. Following the advice of the other review about gently disassembling the handset and cleaning the circuit board restores the use of all buttons!"
1,"I wouldn't want to buy ""used-good condition"" or less","We purchased two used rechargable portable phones that were advertised as being ""used -very good condition.""My complaints:1. The phones were purchased on September 1, 2008. They were not shipped until October 2 and we recieved them on October 6, 2008.2. While the phones work just fine, they arrived with a substance which looked like food on them requiring cleaning and without the charger base units for both of them, and only one of them had a battery.3. We were able to use them after cleaning and had our own charger bases for them but would have purchased new in the future for the slight savings and the lengthy delay in recieving the product.Steve Abegg"
2,Keypad Issue,"This phone system is great, except for the fact that the number 1 keys on every single one of our six handsets don't function without a lot of encouragement. Unfortunately, this makes the phone system a struggle to use almost every time we go to make a call. Our business is currently looking for a replacement phone system after only two years with Panasonic."
3,One Is The Lonliest Number,"Love the phone system, HATE the fact that I've had to swap out 2 handsets. Now the dreaded #1 problem is rearing it's ugly head! Uggh!"
4,Handset,"You are absolutely right, the #1 on the keypad on BOTH my handset units doesnt work unless I play around with it. But the whole system itself I like. Ive had it 3 years, almost 4, using the same handsets."
3,PANASONIC SHOULD FIX THE PROBLEM WITH THIS PHONE...,"Decent system, but the #1 on the dial pad begins to fail right about the time the warranty expires. Panasonic knows about the problem but is not helpful. The local service center informed me that they have repaired ""lots of these"". When I pursued the matter, they became defensive & attributed the failure to the fact that the #1 is the most frequently dialed number. Nice try...after years of use, the #1 has not failed on any of our cell phones, my Sony phone or the AT&T model. In fact, in my experience with many, many phones, the #1 on the keypad has only failed with this Panasonic handset and, in our case, has failed on 1/2 of the handsets. Were it not for the fact that I have an investment in this system, I would not have purchased a replacement. Good luck!!"
1,Couldn't be worse,"These handsets work well for about 6 months - then battery issues (I think) thurn the cordless handsets into crap - really - ununsable, and the number ""1"" button seems to fail within the first year on all handsets."
5,Kostabi is a Renaissance Man,"Songs for Sumera showcases the many talents of Mark Kostabi. Not only is the music wonderful, but the booklet of Kostabi's artwork that accompanies the CD is a testament to the many talents of this artist. Kostabi's collaboration with Kristian Jarvi is a testament to the rich musical heritage of Estonia. It must be in the genes."
1,still waiting on blooms...,Unfortunately these did not work for me. For whatever reason I never had any blooms this year. I'm hoping they will come eventually...
3,An evolution of style and form.,"This is my second recording by Mr.Roach.The first,""artifacts"",was more focused.I rate that one ""5"" stars. This one,however,is good without ever holding my interest for long.I would rate it ""3"" stars.I look to obtain much more recent examples of work by Mr.Roach."
5,WORKS ON SWORDS TOO!,"i bought a cheapy katana recently, not a legit forged steel katana...just one made from stainless...but nonetheless if im going to have a sword it should be sharp, right!? anyway my choices were to get the special oils and sharpening stones OR to get the accusharp...well i chose this and it REALLY does work...since my sword was more of a display it didn't already really have an edge on it, so it took a while to get it sharp,,,but now it is just as sharp as a chef's knife...if you already have a blade or an edge to what you want to cut it shouldn't take long at all to sharpen....5 stars!"
5,Great sharpener,The Accusharp sharpener is one of the simplest and most reliable sharpeners I have found. It's great to be able to just replace the blades and not invest in a new sharpener.
2,Why would you buy these when for $4...,...you can send your sharpener back to the manufacturer and they'll return it good as new (read the fine print on the package).
4,Great hand held sharpener,This sharpener is the best hand held I have ever used. Easy to use and the replacement stones are easy to replace and inexpensive. I will continue to use
5,A great product,"The original blades that came with our AccuSharp unit did not quite last 5 to 10 years as advertised, but did last full 3 years, performing wonderfully. I am fully willing to forgive this ""actual mileage"" and to buy the replacement blades without any hard feelings, as AccuSharp is no gimmick. It does its job, and very well at that."
3,Replacement blades,I was pleased to find this product. They do not stay as sharp or last as long as the originals. All things considered it is a good product. The only other option for me is to throw away the sharpener.
4,Work just like the original,"These replacement blades work like the original and are easy to replace. Just remove 3 screws from your AccuSharp and replace the blades as instructed on the package. My only gripe is that the replacement blades don't cost much less than the AccuSharp itself. When the AccuSharp is still like new, however, you might as well get the replacement blades."
3,A frustrating disappointment!,"Foremost, it takes forever to get a hold of this CD Single, and when you finally receive it -- if ever, it contains the short AM radio versions of both songs, instead of the extended versions that were popularly played in the 70's. The original extended versions are indeed defintive. For ""Last Dance"" the EP can be found in ""The Dance Collection"" and the soundtrack of ""TGIF."" ""The Dance Collection"" contains the 12"" version of ""With Your Love."" although it's a little bit shorter than the original 12"" version on vinyl. A good disco/dcance track should last forever, and not for the trickle over three minute versions contained herein. What a pity it is, really."
1,999 Dollars?!!!! WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?!,"eh? i'd be very suspicious of this website. for one thing you can get all the versions of 'Pied Piper' anywhere for under twenty bucks. second, the version with Donovan is not the one featured on the DVD cover, it's the Van Johnson version. another thing, they spelled Hamelin wrong.i am speaking about a particular Amazon website for this DVD, but Amazon has a bad tendency to put a review for a particular website on all the websites for a film. i'm talking about this particular website that is asking 999 dollars for this. Amazon should be more careful who it deals with in the future."
2,A minor book that fails the promise of its subtitle.,"The author often shows a nice turn of phrase or insight but this book falls far short of explaining the contributions of technology to the Civil War. Some topics are simply ignored like the telegraph and signal communications. Others are given short shrift. The significance of repeating rifles is restricted to a paragraph on Wilder's Brigade at Chickamauga. Bacon is let down by a miserable index. There are no entries under repeating rifle or Spencer for the that paragraph. Nor can one find Rifled cannon, Parrot or Rodman, submarine or torpedo. Virtually any of the 24 items in this book's bibliograpy would be a better choice"
4,Decent phone,"I needed a business phone with the following requirements:1. 900Mhz so as not to interfere with the 2.4Ghz wireless internet (most 5.8Ghz phones actually use the 2.4Ghz spectrum for receiving).2. Caller ID display on phone itself.3. Speakerphone on phone itself.4. Normal sized, rather than the tiny ones they are pushing these days.5. Adjustable ringer volume (hi/low/off), on both phone and base.It met all of these requirements. The range is kind of short, and the optional belt clip does not work all that well. Also if you press the hold button by accident (which I seem to do frequently) it's a pain to turn it off. Finally, the buttons wore out after about a year, so I had to buy a new one. Other than those minor hassles, this is a good phone. I would recommend getting one but the only place to find it is ebay. Search for KX-TC1713B or KX-TC1713."
3,Bowling shoes,As always you can count on Dexter to make a good sporting shoe whether it be bowling or golf shoes. The only problem is that Dexter always made their shoes in USA now they have followed the lead of other shoe makers and have stooped to cheap foreign labor
2,A action horror movie with lots of action and jokes!,"This turkey movie star Treat Williams(Deep End of The Ocean) as a cop who gets killed and is brought back to life.This a buddy moive much like the ""Lethal Weapon"" movies, but it does not take itself too seriously.It not too scary and I would even think that by today's standards t would rated PG-13! If you like a turkey movie once in a while buy this one! Plus it does not cost as much as the other videos they have here! Face it guys,this video is bargain! Now go buy it and have some laughs while you watch it! Also starring is Vincent Price as the villian trying to take over the world!..."
3,Weird but OK!,"I saw this movie on cable tv back around 1990 or 1991 and kind of liked it. Then it just sort of disappeared. Four or five months ago (early summer 2002) I was looking at some DVDs at a flea market and, lo and behold, there it was ... all brand new and shrink-wrapped. I think I paid a whole [$] for the DVD. It was marketed by some off-the-wall video company, but surprise, surprise, the picture and sound quality are VERY good. I think it looks as good as it did on cable. Well, the movie is still not a classic or anything, but it probably is developing a following of sorts since it is so hard to come by. Sorry, but I can't help you to find a copy of it. The best I can do is to tell you to do what I did ... search carefully at your local flea market and keep your fingers crossed. Good luck."
3,Not bad for the 80's,Some real funny parts doing the BUDDY cop movie but with your partner being dead.. Great twist to the whole buddy cop genre that over took the 80's. I diffently reccomend to watch or buy and at 5 bucks how can you go wrong
4,"zombies, piscopo, and price..., oh my","I am very excited to discover that Dead Heat is on it's way to DVD. We have officers Roger Mortis (Treat Williams) and Doug Bigelow (joey P)hunting re-animated crooks. In the course of their investigation, Mortis get's whacked and must go through the ""Resurrection machine"" for a second chance at heroism.Dead Heat: blood, guts, decaying bodies, and laughter--one of 1988's finest films and an underappreciated comedy-horror.Other notable players are Dr McNab, played by Darren McGavin (father from Christmas Story), Martha Quinn (how 80's can you get), oh and some guy named Vincent Price as Loudermilk."
4,Dead Heat,I LOOKED FOR THIS TITLE A LONG TIME AND FINALLY FOUND IT. IT IS IN A SEALED DVD CONTAINER.
5,Babyville,"This was the first Jane Green book I read and now I'm hooked! Once you start reading, you can't put it down. I recommend any of her other books too!"
4,Entertaining,"I really liked this book, which, believe me, is unusual! I had previously read ""Jemima J"", and though I don't remember much about it, I know I didn't care much for it. In fact, I was very trepidatious about buying another Jane Green book. But the title intrigued me (as I had recently had a baby myself), so I gave it a try. I'm glad I did. The writing was consistent through the entire book and the characters were likeable. Sure, maybe some of the situations were a little far-fetched, but this isn't epic literature we're talking about. It was an amusing, quick read that I enjoyed from beginning to end."
3,Starts off good...................,"But gets predictable and dull. I didn't like the character of Maeve, and her story was just too fairy-tale for me. I liked Jane Green's other books better."
3,The best of the worst,"I made the mistake of buying into the hype and buying almost all of Jane Green's books at once. Now that I've bought them, I figure I might as well read them. They are very quick and easy to read.Babyville and Jemima J. are the only two of her books that I could possibly see passing along, MAYBE. I think they are fun and easy with likeable characters.All her other books, I'm sorry, are trash. The writing is horrible and the characters are incredibly unpleasant-full of insecurities or worse, full of themselves. UGH! HORRIBLE.The women tend to be like those annoying girls that you were in high school with that were silly and full of themselves and would dump their best friend for a boy who dumped them next week and came crawling back to you. Yet these characters are usually in their 30's.But as for Babyville (and Jemima J.) are much better than the rest."
3,A little disappointing...,"I have been reading how great Jane Green's books were and couldn't wait to read one. ""Babyville"" was my first ( I even paid full retail for it!). I thought, as a 29 year-old married woman about to embark on my own family, that this would be perfect for me. After finishing it, I thought the book was okay. Maybe my expectations were a little too high? I did like how the book was broken up into three parts and the twists of how they are connected, and characters were likable and believable, but I found myself not quite understanding a lot of their British slang and jokes. I read all three of Sophie Kinsella's ""Shopaholic"" series which I love, love, love, and her British humor was funny and understandable.If I could I would give it three and a half stars, but if you skip this one, don't feel too bad. I'm not sure if I'll even venture reading another one of Green's books."
3,Good...but one part ruined the whole book.,"Was anyone else totally dissapointed when Julia basically didnt even care that Mark was living with his new pregnant girlfriend who stole Julias job? I was so bummed, I totally wanted (and expected) that when Julia found out about it, it would be a huge dramatic scene! I thought for sure with the way Jane Green was leading you on that Julia was going to one day show up at her old house with Mark and catch Maeve there preganant.When Julia found out ...the only thing it says is that she had been crying a lot about it. NOOO...not good enough. Very weak in my opinion."
5,Browsing,"I was pregnant at the time I wanted a book to read. I thought that the title was cute and maybe had something to do with being pregnant and having a baby and having a family. I was pleasantly surprised! I loved this book!!!! The book is about 3 women and their encounters with pregnancy and babies. It is intriguing to read about the different ways women handle circumstances. Each character in the book is connected in some way or another, which is another aspect of the story that I enjoyed."
3,Too much...,"I don't know exactly why, but this book made me want to skip ahead to the end. It wasn't that I was excited to see what happened; it just seemed to drag on implausibly for much too long. Jane Green is not one of my favorite authors. I also tried her Jemima J, with much the same feeling. Too melancholy, not enough joy in either of these novels."
2,WHAT HAPPENED?!!??!,"Having read JEMIMA J AND BOOKENDS and loving them, I have to say I was very disappointed in BABYVILLE. It appears to me that Ms. Green has a multi-book deal with Broadway Books and she's just writing to meet deadlines, she's not writing with a good eye for content. I can't honestly say that I liked, or could relate to any of the characters in this book. They all seemed so immature and self-absorbed and the stereotypes practically drove me crazy. I usually love British Chick-lit books for their snappy turn-of-phrase, this book didn't have any of that. It took me two long weeks to finish only because I kept thinking it would get better and I have to say: I'm barely a fan after reading this."
3,: sigh : C for compassion,"After Jemimi J, I was so anxious to read any more books by her, but babyville wasn't one of my favorites. Its really obsessive about pregnancy to an annoying point. Just imagine how Charlotte from sex and the city sometimes got obsessive with having a baby, now double it by 4.I regretted buying it, such a shame she didn't live up to her name. But maybe i'll identify with the charcters when I'm expecting or a mum, but as for now. I wouldn't recommend this book to a friend."
1,I'm offended!,"If you have ever struggled to conceive, please don't buy this book! I thoroughly enjoyed the story until the last page, which read, ""The stress of wanting to conceive can stop conception happening"". One of the main characters, Julia, who has difficulty conceiving, suddenly becomes pregnant at the end of the story, ostensibly because she has stopped trying. For those of us who have suffered through the agony of infertility, it is nearly unendurable to have idiots like Jane Green chalk it all up to stress. Women in war-torn Bosnia conceived, for Pete's sake. Stress does not cause infertility!"
1,"Horrible, why don't they have ""0 stars"" as an option.","This movie is completely awful. Out of the whole film, maybe two of the girls were hot. Some had scars on their breasts where the implants were inserted. One in particular had so much work done to her lips, it looks like she was punched in the mouth, and the lip swelled.I like softcore, but I had never seen a Seduction Cinema title before this one. Quite frankly, I would be happy to never see one again. Not only were the women skanky, but I could have financed this title with the money that is currently in my wallet.Did I mention the music drove me crazy? They took five seconds of tribal drums beating, and they played it over and over and over throughout the entire film.My advice is to avoid this title at all costs...Bottom Line: This title stinks worse than the family bathroom after dad uses it on Chili Night. I can't believe I paid for it."
5,Berlin School Roach!,"You may think of Steve Roach as this relaxing and ambient artist whose sonic atmospheres float lovingly from one open space to another. For a lot of Steve Roach music, that prior description fits his compositional style very well. And for those who love the ambient Steve Roach this Album may not be for you. For those of you, who want to know another side of Steve Roach, read on! Steve Roach had to get his start somewhere, and Traveler was in the beginning. Influenced by not only the bands of the time and the technology available, Traveler gives you a look at how Steve Roach and the Berlin School of Electronic Music melded as one. This is not floating from one space to another. No, No my friend! This is passages of sequences, minor chords, and sonic flights that change and dart from one thought to another. This is Steve Roach #2. The second album! If you like the Berlin School, then check out this album. Enjoy!!!"
3,We are accidents waiting to happen!,"""There There"" is my favorite track on the new album at this point. However, the new b-sides are not very good, in my opinion. I suggest downloading them first to see if you like them. If not, just buy the album. It's great."
4,Very good sound for the money,"I am very happy with the sound of this speaker. They do lack bass, but i bought a 10"" powered Boston Acoustics sub to compliment them.I did bi-wire mine on the advice of some other Monitor 60 owners. While not night and day better, i do think it helps. Set your subwoofer crossover level ( at the reciever ) in the 50hz-60hz range, use high quality speaker wire, and give them some break in time.I have had mine for about a year, and am still very impressed with the detail they produce. My only reason for no 5 star is that i'm sure it's not the perfect speaker, but their performance per dollar spent is outstanding."
4,"Good tone, good price","I got these to replace a set of Onkyo speakers that I had mounted on floor stands, but the kids had knocked the stands over one too many times, so it was time to find a floor standing model that might be a little more difficult to knock over and still work with the rest of the system. These were easy to install and have produced great sound - mostly TV and movie watching. I've not noticed any issues with their blending with the rest of the Onkyo surround and subwoofer from the previous system using my Denon receiver's auto setup."
4,Not bad,"I got a pair of these from a different seller for a cheaper price and for the price I paid they are pretty well worth it. I'm pushing them with a Yamaha HTR-5940 amp and they seem to handle the abuse pretty well. Does get a bit scratchy at around -15db blasting some good old Metallica but hey what do you expect for a budget pair of speakers? They work very well for home theater, very full and rich. Not much to say for bass, but for 5.25"" woofers what do you expect? Thats why I've got a sub (also from polk, psw111). Highs are a bit harsh at higher volumes but that may also be from my amp who knows. Overall a very decent speaker for the money."
2,Knizhnik,"Polk Audio Monitor 60 AM6022-A 2-Way Floorstanding Speaker (Single, Cherry)I bought these speakers with hope after my SONY-7000 tweeter broke. The sound is flat, mid range is not transparent and low base is almost absent. Working power is about 10 watt - anything higher - distortions and clipping. Aesthetically OK, but smaller bookshelf boxes sound juicier. Returned to seller.Get something with 8"" drivers and bigger. I will get back to SONY F-7000."
2,Not what I was looking for,"I bought these mainly for music and I found that they were too heavy on the vocals and drums. Guitars often ended up getting lost underneath. The treble range could be impressive at times, but it bordered on being too bright, and suffered from really bad sibilance, which I'm sensitive to. The mid-bass was overly punchy. There is also zero low end bass. I thought this might be a problem while reading the reviews, but I've met so many people who are bass nuts and need to have ridiculously loud bass that I don't listen to anyone when it comes to bass anymore. I'm not docking any stars for the lack of deep bass though, because it's quite possible these were designed to be used with a sub. Just be aware that these are not full-range by any means.Overall, the unbalanced sound and sibilance is what did these in for me, and I ended up selling them."
2,Get DW682K Corded Joiner,"Should have listened to John Bryer review...Corded Plate Joiner is gutless. I set up a comparision between my 18v and my brother's corded. The first biscuit (on full charge) only cut about 90% and then the blade stalled. Same thing on the second. Slowing down the feed solved the stalling problem but left me disappointed with the performance of the tool. Otherwise, the cuts were of the same high quality as the corded joiner. The portability is somewhat offset by the extra weight and the need to have a vacuum attached to ensure through dust extraction."
1,Not for iMac.,Beware! Tomb Raider Chronicles is not for new iMacs. It is for older classic Macs only.
5,nice to have,"in my opinion, i think these paint jars make it easy to measure your paint to thinner ratio. this is probably for begginers but hey, why work harder...work smarter right lol"
5,Consumer Reports is right!,"I bought this saw today for $99.00 at Home Depot. I did a considerable amount of research. I decided on the Makita because of the price. However, when I saw this one on sale I had to have it.In short, it is the best circular saw I have ever used. I brought it home and tore through some pretty thick red oak with a steel blade (just to see what it would do); it ripped through it easily. I didn't even feel the wood it was cutting. It is hands down the best circular saw I have ever used."
4,Solid tool,Having used a number of lower-priced circular saws over the years I decided to spend the extra money and go for Milwaukee. I was not disappointed and anticipate many years of powerful and reliable service from this well designed machine. Having bought a Milwaukee Sawzall and a Holeshooter drill more than ten years ago I can report that these tools last.
4,good saw - but also consider a wormdrive,"Everyone loves this saw, or so it seems from the reviews. I like this saw as well, I own it. I've had it for over a year and a half and I've cut everything from 1x4s to 6x6s, mostly for framing. I still think it lacks power compared to a worm drive, which isn't all that much more expensive. Here's what I'd like you to consider before buy a circular saw: try out a worm drive before buying anything. Brakes are a definate plus, for you don't want to slow down when you're on a roll and they make for a downright safer cut. Also consider the $60 Skil 13amp saw with a laser. Skil is a great name when it comes to circular saws, and what a great price. If you want to spend more look at the Skil worm drive saw. If you want to buy milwaukee, buy the version of this circular saw with a brake, you'll thank yourself later."
4,great saw,"At first I thought this saw was a little heavy for what I needed but having used it for a short time, I really like it. It plows right through wood and paperstone."
2,Said made in USA but in the box it was MADE IN CHINA,"Just a heads up. I went to a local Home Depot to check out this saw. I was dead set on getting this saw for $130 because the display saw said ""Made in USA"" right on the saw (not the box or case). I was also looking at the Makita 5007NK for $99. It was made in China. I told the lady at the register that as soon as I go through the line I'm opening the box and if it is made in China I will return it immediately. I ended up doing just that. Opened the box and looked at the saw and the saw said ""Made in CHINA"" in the same place that the display model said ""Made in USA"". I returned it, and walked over and bought the Makita instead.I'm not sure if this is a ploy by Home Depot, or by Milwaukee or what, but it sucks.Go buy the Makita instead."
3,Nice handle but sloppy base.,"I was all set to buy this product until I went to Home Depot to see it. After looking at it for a while, I noticed that if you hold the base firmly, the saw and blade can flex about 2 degrees. It appears that the problem results from Milwaukee using cheap rivets to connect the saw to the base. I instead bought the DeWalt 363. I am very happy and give this a 5 star."
3,baseplate problem,"I bought this saw based on all the reviews and reputation. When I tried to square the baseplate to the blade I checked the plate for flatness and found it to be warped. It had at least a 1/8"" dip in the middle of the plate, right where you place a square to check for 90 to the blade! I checked a display model at a local dealer and it had a dip also, though not as bad.I looked for other saws with strong, flat bases and chose the Porter Cable. The adjusting handles are small and hard to use but at least I can expect square cuts!"
5,Superb Powerhouse!!!!,"I am a contractor who bought this saw about seven years ago. It was a powerhouse. After all those years of cutting thru everything that i threw at it, it gave up on me last year. This saw cuts like butter and you can't bog it down. I own lots of circular saws, some even more expensive. About a week after it tore up on me, i bought another one just like it. It's just hard to work without the best."
2,Crappy Shoe,"This saw is awesome....except. Don't expect square cuts, because the shoe on every single one I have seen/used is warped right where you need to hold your square to set the blade-to-shoe bevel to be square when adjusting it. If this saw had the same MAG shoe as the Porter Cable, I would have kept it. But, I exchanged it for a Porter Cable, and even though I don't have Tilt-lok, I have a keyless blade change, and good square cuts."
5,Now this is where it all began,"Maybe Monstrosity released their debut a few years after Morbid Angel, Atheist Obituary or Hellwitch, that doesnt take away from the fact that Imperial Doom is a Florida deathmetal classic. And for those who have been living under a rock, this is george corpsegrinder fletcher's debut album as a deathmetal powerhouse singer and it is nothing less than stellar to say the least. Remember back in '95 when people were sayin ""who's this new guy on vocals? what happened to barnes?"" Well now you know; and with all due respect to Cannibal Corpse, take that Vile disc out of the CD player and throw this bad boy on the turntable. Imperial Doom will show you how its done."
1,DISAPPOINTING CD :@(,"It grows tiring within the first few listens. I thought it would be a better CD than it initially was. I would recommend {Immolation - Dawn Of Possession }which came out in 1991 which is a timeless classic,but not Monstrosity which is a fitting name for a poor uninspired band."
1,No support after warranty! Support abysmal.,"This product is not serviceable after one year warranty! Am informed by Buffalo tech support that the root operating system is not accessible by Buffalo or anyone except the Japanese firm they appear to only be resellers for and who do not offer support. I bought two of these Terastations and one of them failed to boot after only three months. If this happens to you after the warranty, you are out the considerable purchase price (as much as $1000!) as no one can service it. I found Buffalo tech support extremely difficult to reach and not adequately knowledgeable of their own product. Buffalo's system for RMAs is also a hassle. I strongly advise to avoid buying this product that Buffalo is maintaining an obviously deceptive support position on."
1,Read this if you're a business user,"My client had been using a TeraStation 1Tb as the main file server. It works as advertised, but after 18 months it died, the unit shut itself down and when we restarted it, it can no longer connect. Since it is out of warranty, Buffalo will do nothing for us, NOT EVEN SELL US A REPLACEMENT CORE. They offer no extended warranty, although the support supervisor was kind enough to call Austin HQ with the problem, they still won't budge. So if you are considering using this as the main file server, or any Buffalo product in a crirtical business application, BE WARNED."
3,"useful, but performs poorly","I was very disappointed with the performance of this NAS because the gigabit ethernet performed little better than 100mbps ethernet. You can not attach the box via USB, so this limited speed is one's only option.With a Maxtor 300GB USB 2 drive attached to my computer, I could copy a 717MB file from my internal SATA drive at an average speed of almost 29 MB/s (230 mbps). Using Jumbo 7MB frames, I could copy the same file to the NAS at just 7.2 MB/s using a new Linksys gigabit ethernet switch (which was very noisy, but that is another story). Switching to my 6 year old SMC 100mbps switch, I could achieve almost the same speed, 6.2 MB/s using 7.2 MB frames, and 4.5 MB/s using the default 1.5 MB/s frames."
1,"Not bad when it works, but...","I have two of these units. Both have failed within the warranty period due to disk failures. Both were using raid5 and, despite what you'd expect, the data was not recoverable. The newest unit just failed again with a broken network connection, one day outside of the 1yr warranty. I now have a very expensive set of spare parts for the 2nd unit. These devices are not bad when the work but they don't work very long. Pay a bit more money and get a better quality NAS."
1,"Can't defragment, does not support windows file attributes","Fails to recognize archive, read-only and hidden file attributes. This messes up things like tape backup. It can only support one file system and it's not NTFS. You can't defragment the drives so they are very fast out of the box, but keep on getting slower as time goes on.Probably good for a home user archiving data, but don't think about it for small business with several users that update files on a regular basis. Also can not be used in conjunction with a tape drive for performing incremental or differential backups due to the missing file flags.If you do decide to buy it suggest updating the firmware as soon as you open the box. Seems to have been a few speed improvements."
4,Nice and easy,"I work in a small office (3 users, 5 PCs). I was looking for something easy to use, small enough to take off-site, big enough to hold all our files, and safe (two previous USB external drives failed, taking most of the data with them). I'm not using it as a media server, so speed isn't an issue.So far (4 months) I'm happy. It could use better backup software but, for a sub-$1000 TB Raid system, it does everything we need."
3,Completely mediocre,"It does what it is supposed to do, but it is dog-slow - at least in Raid 5 configuration (even with the latest firmware 1.12). The lack of a defragment utility may mean big trouble down the line.One handy thing includes the ability to plug other USB drives into it and access them over the network. But for some stupid reason the Terastation has to format the drives itself in order to be able to write to them (you can access the drives read-only without the format). It formats them into an incompatible format so you won't be able to plug it directly into your PC anymore.The backup software is a complete waste, you'll have to invest in something else.For the price, it is a decent product. But if performance is at all important to you, look elsewhere like the ReadyNAS."
2,Just what I needed,"I hated worrying about disk space always running out, and with TeraStation, no more worries. Backup everything easily, make quick copies of DVDs easily, store lots of video files, etc.This product was good in 2005, not 2010. Buy an HP MediaSmart Home Server instead!"
3,a book about getting away with it,"Holmes is a gifted writer with strong funny dialog and a great plot. The book is difficult to put down. But afterward it felt like enjoying junk food on thanksgiving. You put so much into it, enjoy it at the time, but after kind wonder what it could have been. It's a sexual murder mystery heavy on the sex. But it comes down to the fact that every character is shallow, especially the first-person protagonist. This is a book about getting away with it and nothing more. If he threw in just ONE likeable character it could have really turned the book into a great one."
1,Sorry I've Tried But I Can Only Get Through The First Couple Chapters,I was really excited to get this book. I saw Mr. Holmes on the Today Show and his book sounded interesting. A good mystery is always a good read to me. This book is so hard to read because of its many characters. I lost track of who is who after awhile. It's not a fast read!
3,Has a few twists,"Ok, I admit it..I've been a Rupert Holmes fan since college (almost 30 years ago) when I was first introduced to his album ""Widescreen"". I was curious to see how his talents as a writer would pan out, as ""Widescreen"" has some very witty lyrics. This novel is hardly ground-breaking, but it has an interesting concept, and the writing has some occasionaly clever turns of phrase. In the long run, it is far-fetched and the heroine thwarts ""death"" a few too many times to be plausible. The book is fine for some light summer reading, but don't expect too much from its pages."
2,Stieg Larsson Millenium Trilogy,"The trilogy was clearly labeled as Dubbed in English when in fact it is sub titled. The reciept that I recieved also states that its 'DUBBED"" in English."
2,not in english,"I was disappointed in finding this trilogy was not in English. NO where did I see that it was stated that it was only in Swedish. They need to add that detail to their description of the product, so others wont be disappointed like I was. I was really looking forward to seeing this trilogy as I have read the books. Sub titles just dont do it for me.THanks"
2,Not what I expected,"These dvd's are subtitled. The movies are great, but nowhere did it tell me that they where subtitled! I sent them back for a refund."
3,negative,"EACH DISK IS MADE UP OF 2 PARTS AND SET UP MUST BE VISITED TO SELECT DUBBED VERSION FOR EACH PART. (AN ANNOYANCE) THE DUBBING IS PROFESSIONAL AND VISUAL CLARITY IS GOOD. THE ADDITIONAL CONTENT ADDS MUCH TO CHARACTER AND PLOT DEVELOPMENT. I COULD NOT FIND A WAY TO SELECT A DUBBING VERSION OF THE BONUS DVD. WHY A SUB TITLED OPTION WAS EVER INCLUDED BAFFLES ME. GOOD MOVIE, BUT NOT WORTH THE MONEY FOR THIS PACKAGE."
1,Aussie version,"I am very annoyed. I have purchased some items through Amazon and been told that this version is not available in Australia. I ordered these. No indication of not being available in Australia so I clicked away.Imagine my disappointment and anger when the Zone 1 (US version) was sent instead of the Zone 4 Australian version. Surely you would think that the department that deals with DVD's at Amazon would realise that there different zones in the world and send the correct items!!The Stieg Larsson Trilogy (The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, The Girl Who Played with Fire, The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest)"
2,dubbed into english?,I enjoyed the motion picture version of the Dragon Tattoo Trilogy because it was dubbed into english. This release appearsto only be in Swedish with English sub titles.
3,Not As Described,FYI....This is not Millenium the mini-series. It is actually the triology in French. If this is what you are looking for then you are in luck.
1,Don't get this one - It is missing half the movie.,The extended version contains a huge amount of missing footage. I didn't realize it until I saw the extended version and was amazed at the difference. I feel ripped off.
4,I enjoyed the trilogy very much...more than the single American version. I would rate it higher if one of the discs didn't stall,One of the three discs does stall. It continues again...probably 3 or 4 times during the viewing. I enjoyed the Swedish version much more than the American.
5,Good intrigue!,"excellent movie, the acting was at its best, good rendering of the book, pass it along to friends who were enchanted."
5,Love this movie,I saw all 3 at the movie and I can't even watch the American version. The story is so great you don't even realize you are reading sub-titles. This triogy is captivating!
3,Original Dragon Tattoo and the entire trilogy,"was spoiled by the more faithful and gritty david fincher version of first book before seeing these three films, and found it lacking in its chronology as well as telling the complete story in the Larson trillogy. it is well shot, complete in what it does unfold and the actors very good- either with subtitles or dubbed (watched both ways several times). Worth having as a more European veiw of the events in the books, rather than anglicized in your face ~ I just hapened to see Fincher's first."
5,great set,Loved these movies. The extended edition has more material that complements the theatrical version very well. Bonus footage is also very interesting.
5,Dragon Tattoo Trilogy: Extended Edition,"I am a fan of Steig Larsson's work so I was thrilled to be able to get this and watch it. I loved it.. if you are a fan of Swedish crime stories, or the late Steig Larsson, you really should get this series."
5,Dragon Trilogy,"I saw the first movie out of red box but wanted to see the whole thing. The movies are so intense you are just sucked into the stories to the degree that you don't even notice that you are watching with subtitles. (you can use the english translation but I went with Swedish and the English subtitles) After watching these movies, I dont know why Hollywood is going to remake them. Waste of time and I don't know if any actress can better play the lead. A must own movie set."
5,Pretty Awesome!,"After reading all of the books and I saw that just one American movie had been made and the leading female star to play Lisbeth did not in my mind fit the book Lisbeth I decided to buy the Dragon Tattoo Trilogy, Extended Edition and I REALLY was happy with my choice. Acting very well done,and it was nice that there were no commercials etc: Overall for a mini-series it was well done and I got to see all of the books played out. Beware! Make a few meals, pop a lot of popcorn and sit with an ice chest filled with soda next to you, because once it starts up you won't want to move! Enjoy."
5,You Will Not Be Disappointed,"Nikolaj Arcel did a remarkable job with the screen play adaptation. Noomi Rapace is a little tall for the role but does an excellent job with the character of Lisbeth. Unfortunately, the complex character of Erika Berger is not fully developed. Some reviewers have written that only Swedish language with English subtitles was available. The version I received has an option of English dubbing or Swedish language with English subtitles. Perhaps these options were not available in earlier editions."
4,Dragon tatoo trilogy review,"I never did read the three books, but did see the American version of 'Girl with the dragon tatoo' at the theater. That movie was excellent and left me wanting more. The original trilogy I purchased was inexpensive AND very well done. Although it was English dubbed, they did an excellent job. The dragon tatoo movie (1 of 3 in the package), although somewhat different than the American movie version, is quite good and would have been even better had I not seen the American version at the theater. Bottom line: you won't be disappointed with this trilogy, and it's well worth having in a collection. I highly suggest purchasing this trilogy set from Amazon."
5,Men Who Hate Women series,"I enjoyed this set even more than the original release, though it is not really all that different. Some new scenes and a few extended ones. Sadly, though Erika's role is expanded, it still seems to pull back from Mr. Larsson's original storyline of a much more passionte extramarital relationship between Mikke and Erika. Maybe just too controversial even for today's audience?? Not sure if it is my player, but the last minutes of both Parts 1 and 2 had some skipping (thus the conclusions a bit jumpy), even though the set was bought new and I could see no scratches or imperfections on the discs."
4,very good quality,"even though the dvd were dubbed in english, i didn't set the ist disc up properly and read subtitles, the 2nd and 3rd I saw were dubbed in english. The voice of Mikel sounded like that of a japanese dubbed film. Once I got used to it it was fine. I hope they make the 2nd and 3rd books in english, I enjoyed the american version of the girl with Dragon tattoo more."
5,Great Buy,Better than the english version I saw them all in the movie theater by my house! I refuse to even entertain the english version
5,Larson Trilogy,"Very true to the books, although major subplots are minimized or eliminated. Best to watch in subtitles as opposed to dubbed versions. Beautiful photography, excellent acting."
4,Consistently good,"I found myself wanting more from this very well produced series. Very interesting and moving stories that stay with you for days. An obvious European feel not just from the film locations but the essence of the movie. Very raw, and superb acting. Definitely a restricted adult movie."
3,Very Poor Transfer to Blu-ray,"All three movies are great, like that they are dubbed in English.Sorry but had to take away 2 stars because of the very poor transferto blu-ray, I can't believe they couldn't have done a better job,very fuzzy in a lot of parts."
3,the steig larrson trilogy,Great service from AmazonThe trilogy was a bit dissapointing especially the second disc I was glad that I had read the books first
2,The Girl witht he Dragon Tattoo trilogy,"Be careful in purchasing the trio pkg. Mostly all so far are in Swedish with English subtitles. Not good, read carefully!!!!"
5,Much better than The Columbia release,"I actually ran across this on Netflix streaming. A winner. Just finished watching the first 'book' and it is much better than the recently released American version. I have not read the books so can't comment on accuracy. Thoroughly enjoyable, well-acted. Enjoy!"
4,Love it,I remember when I first saw these movies. Now I have the DVD box set the films are still as engaging as they were the first time.
5,Great,"Very good movies. I recommend everybody to watch them. The first movie ""the girl with the dragon tattoo"" may be a little boring in the beginning but once you start understanding more about it it gets very good. As for the sequels, they are even better the first one. They more focused on the main character."
4,Excellent!,"This is really a five-star, except it's not filmed in my native tongue. The English dubbing is really quite good, however."
5,Awesome,"For anyone that's seen the American version, I believe you should watch the original Swedish version. It's amazing. You can watch it dubbed in English or in Swedish with subtitles (I recommend). This version is over 6 hours total and tells much more of the Lizbeth story."
4,Movie/Quality,The Swedish movie version of the books is a good screenplay and enjoyed it as well as I did the American movie version of the first book. Quality of the DVDs were not as sharp as I'd have liked.
4,Trilogy,"I enjoyed the movie. I thought the Lisbeth character not as good as in the Daniel Craig version, and the Mikael Blomquist character not nearly as good looking. But I enjoyed this version, and really wanted to see the additional books. I watched in the English version and was surprised to find I was not bothered at all by the words spoken not matching the lips of the actors."
3,Meh....plagued by quality problems,"First of all, the 1st disc arrived damaged and I've returned the whole package, but did watch what wasn't damaged.The guy who played Blomqvist was not good, not well cast at all. Everyone else was pretty spot on. The picture quality in some sections was sketchy and (for me) the whole thing had the look and feel of a made for TV special.I watched in Swedish with English subtitles because I liked it better that way, the English 'dubbed' sountrack was passable, but not great.For all the stuff about Erica they included, they never really payed off her character in the end, kinda puzzling."
4,"great books, great movies","I had read all 3 of the books before even considering the movies. I thought the books were some of the best books I had ever read. I loved the character of Lisbeth Salander and to me, Noomi Rapace captured her very well. Watching them dubbed may have taken a little away from the movie, but reading subtitles was worse because it kept me from really seeing the movie.My biggest complaint about dubbing is that you don't get the actor's real emotions like you would if you were watching the originals. I would recommend the books read too, they have so much more than could have ever been put into each movie. But I am not disappointed and have recommended them to many of my friends who are readers and movie buffs."
2,LEGENDAS E DUBLAGEM SOMENTE EM INGLES,"COMPREI O BLU-RAY PENSANDO QUE ATENDIA A REGIO 1 PARA BLU-RAY OU SEJA DUBLAGEM E LEGENDAS EM ESPANHOL, PORTUGUES E INGLES, PARA MINHA SURPRESA QUANDO RECEBÍ O PRODUTO FIQUEI SABENDO QUE ERA FALADO EM SUECO E INGLES E LEGENDADO SOMENTE EM INGLES. SUGIRO QUE O SITE DA AMAZON.COM SEJA MAIS CLARO QUANTO À QUESTO DA REGIO, POIS É GRANDE A DIFERENA ENTRE AS REGIES PARA DVD E PARA BLU-RAY. ESTOU COM UM PRODUTO FANTÁTICO SEM PODER USA-LO."
3,Disapointing,"I read the books and then saw that there were movies. I thought that, even though there may be a little plot discrepancy, there was plenty of material to make good movies.Well, I was very disappointed. The plot followed the book fairly closely - too closely, actually. In a book, the author can jump around to different parts of the story without losing the reader. That doesn't really work too well with a movie. A movie needs to flow. If I hadn't read the books, I would have had a hard time figuring out the plot. Then, add to that the fact that the dubbing was terrible. The mismatch was distracting, adding to the difficulty in following the story.I gave the trilogy 3 stars because there was some good action and it was entertaining to a degree. However, my suggestion is to skip the movies and just read the books."
5,Trilogy,Read the books and loved them. The movies were fantastic. Stuck close to the books. I watched it with subtitles.
3,"3.5 stars -- like the format, love the drawings","This is the story about a mom who buys her son many different things (starting with a hat). Each item follows the same word pattern repeating all the items that came before and adding one to the end, which is a great way to bolster confidence in reading. The boy loves everything that Mom gives him that he wears/takes all of it with him everywhere. It's silly, but I think that there's a subtle message about over-gifting as well. It's clear that the boy accepts the gifts as a token of his mother's love, but he doesn't need them to feel loved.The illustrations by Kevin Hawkes are absolutely gorgeous. They make me want to take a straightedge to the book and frame them.I felt that the story fell short a bit, but I can see that if your child ends up liking it, it's a book that could be read over and over and over again."
3,Not very metallic,"I was expecting more of a metallic shimmer with these pencils, but there was very little shimmer or metallic appearance when using these pencils for coloring and drawing on basic paper. I'll try different types of paper I guess, but so far not very impressed."
3,Doodle Dog,"My daughter got this for her 5th birthday. Initially she loved it, but the appeal wore off quickly. It is not somewhere in the bottom of her toy box. It did not hold her interest."
3,Thin but interesting plot,"When she was ten, Sarah Whitman's life was turned upside down; her father was accused of robbing his bank when he disappeared at the same time a cool million bucks went missing. Her mother, unable to cope with the humiliation, committed suicide, leaving Sarah to grow up with an ""aunt"" in New Orleans. She returns to Maine upon discovery of her father's body, which is found at the bottom of a lake outside town. Sara insists the bank heist investigation be re-opened. She also plans to avenge the devastation that the town brought to her family. Her first love, Chicago nightclub owner Tony returns to stand by her, something he failed to do 20 years earlier. But someone would rather see Sarah dead then the past revisited.Overall, the plot is a bit thin and somewhat predictable; I guessed the bad guy early on (a rare occurrence for me). But Sala always creates such engaging characters, and despite its predictability, I found it to be an interesting story."
5,Dark Water,Fantastic!!!! A wonderful suspense/mystery romance. I couldn't put it down. I hated for it to end. I loved the characters.
4,"Good, easy escapism","This is the first book I have read by Sala, and I certainly enjoyed it. It was a fast, easy read and will keep you turning the pages. Not heavyweight stuff, but great for a snowy afternoon's entertainment. Although I don't usually shop in the romance section, I will check out her other books."
4,An Exciting Suspenseful Thriller,"From the first page I was hooked! I felt so sorry for Sarah - ten years old and witnessing your father being convicted of a crime he didn't committ and finding your mother after she committed suicide - I really hoped that she wouldn't let such traumatic situations bring her down. Sarah - as a grown woman -was a very compelling character. At first I thought she was too coldhearted, but then once she met Tony I realized that she had a softer side. I really like the suspense regarding who killed her father. The only thing that seemed a little far fetched was her Aunt Loretta and her strange ""paranormal insights."" I am almost done with the book and can't wait to see who killed Sarah's father. With approximately 50 pages left, I still can't figure it out. I will definitely read another one of Sharon Sala's books when I'm done with Dark Water."
5,Love it!,"This book is terrific, it has helped me so much to make the right decisions about food and how to put meals together. Finally I have an understanding about carbs and how to eat them without gaining weight. I've even lost 5 pounds so far by following the book. It is so easy!I loved the snack section in the back, I have kids so we are always looking for new snack ideas. I am definitely going to recommend this book to my family and friends."
3,Too fast...,"I wouldn't question the dietician credentials of this author, and don't doubt that they probably have many good ideas about applying common sense to healthy cooking and eating. Common sense, however, should also tell you right from the start that, no matter how healthy and well worked out your diet selection is, guzzling it all down quickly is not going to be good for you. What's the point of putting so much effort and research into the food itself, only for it to be wolfed down in 5 minutes?"
4,Pretty Good But Don't Be Decived,Ok this cd is good but theres one problem....Theres only two tracks on the cd no matter what amazon.com says it only has two tracks. Somewhere I Belong and Step Up (Live). We've all heard Somewhere I Belong but Step Up isn't on any of LP's main releases its a good song but basically that one song for 12 bucks? I would say by a different Import like In The End with the stuido version of Step Up.
5,Linkin Park Do It Again...,"I'm a great fan of Linkin Park and own every album they've released. This is of an amazing album (Metora) and you can see how they have matured, not only in age but style as well. The more I listen to it, the better the tracks become, great job guys!"
5,It was great exept it only had 3 songs.,Somewhere I Belong is my favoritesong of all time! I loved it I alway'sblast it in my room the only thing isis that the CD only has 3 tracks whata rip off!!! For 13 bucks you should geta lot more!!!
2,1st half of this is good only 2 songs,"I recomend just bying the meteora cd because the extra trak ""step up"" isn't worth it. Somewhere I Belong is an amazing song though. I wish that LP would have put more tracks on this like remixes or unreleased songs on it. Oh well"
4,Winged Gargoyle,Ordered the gargoyle for a birthday gift. It arrived on time in a styrofoam container. The container and box was damaged but the gargoyle arrived undamaged. He is very ugly.
3,Needs to be connected to USB AND Sound card,"I bought these speakers thinking I would only need to plug them in through USB, but unfortunately, it has to be plugged in to the sound card. This wouldn't be a problem, if I were using a desktop. The sound is great, I still haven't found a problem, but now I have wires all over my desk.I got these for my laptop, and the sound plug is on the front, so it bothers me that I have wires sticking to my arms as I'm typing. I also have my computer at a slight slant, so I need to either place it flat on my desk, or put something underneath so the audio pin won't fold.So, not so happy with them, and will be returning them."
5,DEKK A225 USB speaker,"These work great. It's nice not to have that power cord with the bulky DC converter on it. ONE LESS CORD ! ! However, it would have been even better if one of the speakers had a headphone outlet on it."
4,"Cute book, just a little bit sassy","My son likes this book, but not as much as 50 below zero. I don't like the fact that the brother says ""see if I care."" To me that is sassy."
5,Cute Story,"Get Out of Bed was a hit with the third graders. They thought it was funny and asked, could it happen?"
1,Trying hard to avoid seeing the allegory,J.K. Rowling was pretty clear about the whole series being a christian allegory in the end. This is an almost painfully obvious theme in the Deathly Hallows. It is more or less swept under the rug in this painfully slow and self indulgent peice. Much more to do with Paganism than Harry Potter. Really trying too hard to use the series as a tool to proselytize paganism than anything enlightening about the series itself
3,secrets revealed,This film helped illuminate J.K Rowlings mind. Finally some insight into the magical world of Harry Potter. I enjoyed this film
3,Decent & entertaining,"I really appreciated learning a bit about the background of magic. This ties the actual, real background of magic in with Harry Potter. Some people may feel that it doesn't focus entirely on Harry Potter, but to me magic & Harry Potter are obviously related, and any time spent discussing magic should be of interest to fans of HP."
4,A much-loved album from the 70's,This album was a huge hit both musically and psychologically in Algeria in the mid 70's. Idir was the first Kabyle (non Arab) musician to make Berber music that the entire country listened to(and loved) The title track is a hauntingly beautiful song between a father and daughter and became a hit in France and was translated into several other languages. Track #5 is a fabulous dance song that no Algerian can remain seated through--and nor will you. Amazon's selection of Algerian music is simply not complete without this sentimental favorite.
5,Enchanting Berber music from Algeria,Another great CD by Idir! Both the music and the lyrics are excellent (that's Idir's style). Idir's and Mila's (his sister) voices are beautiful and soothing to the soul. The CD is a selection of songs from Idir's first and second albums that came out in the late seventies and early eighties. Highly recommended to anyone interested in discovering modern Berber music.
1,Doesn't cut the mustard,"This phone is about ten times backwards from the previous model 1701B. The batteries go out quickly and the range is not even 1/4 of the older model 1701B. I replaced my previous phone(KX-TC1701B with this one because my son drowned it in water, hoping that this one KX-TC1703B would be just as good. NOT!! DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!"
4,not a review but a question,"I am sorry this is not a review. I have to find a class 2 power supply for this phone as the dog chewed up the other one, as funny as that sounds, it did happen. The model # PQLV2 AC Adaptor. I am sorry I am contacting you this way, but you don't have a site where I can send my question."
1,neither phone charges correctly,"I bought two of these based on reviews of other panasonics. They do not apply, neither phone charges correctly and they are both going back! I will buy another panasonic but not these."
2,Not my first choice for Panasonic,"I purchased this Panasonic Cordless phone bc I already had another cordless by Panasonic and I absolutely love it, but it did not have caller ID. I generally have great things to say about Panasonic, but this is one of the worst. The problem that we have is that it doesn't hold a charge very long and it takes a good 24 hours to charge again. We also get static on the line. Other than that it is a great phone, but I would discourage anyone wanting to purchase this phone."
2,NOT WORTH THE MONEY,"I bought this phone b/c it was on sale and I have had other panasonic phones I liked. It constantly seems to ""click"" while Im using it and it has to be charged frequently. Ive had it for 5 months and Im so tired of it Im going to buy another phone. Dont waste your money!"
4,Solid phone,Clear sound and great range. Beats any 2.4G phone for clarity. A bit complex to program but it's do-able.
1,Pick a channel already!,"Bought this phone from a local store and used for two months. I finally returned it this past weekend.This phone looks great on paper. However, it functions terribly. The phone seems to constantly search for a clear channel which causes lots of clicking noises and audio drop-out. It is very similar to a digital cellular phone.Bottom line is that the performance of this phone was intolerable. If I can't use it, I can't give it any more than 1 star.Our phone before this was a Sony (SPSS9101, I believe -- silver 900 MHz spread spectrum with caller ID, no answering machine). It lasted about 7 months until it failed. Sent it back for repair under warranty. Lasted another 2 months until it failed. Sent it back and received a brand new phone. It lasted about 9 months until it failed. I love Sony TVs and receivers, but I'll never buy another phone.So, Sony is out. Panasonic is out. I bought a Uniden and we'll see how that phone works."
3,Bad sound quality...,"This phone has the typical Panasonic characteristics: good looking, solid feeling, feature rich, and good worksmanship. However, this model uses digital transmission, probably a ADPCM-based digital vocoder, so voice will ""clip"" from time to time when it is hit with radio interference. Also, it takes a few seconds for the ADPCM vocoder to ""adapt"" to the radio interference to adjust modulation, which is to clear up voice. It's pretty irritating when part of your voice is chopped... One last thing, Panasonic removed ""rapid charge"" feature from the 2002 product line up, so it will take 15-17 hours to charge up a battery that lasts 5 hours."
1,Bad Choice,"I had this phone for over a year now. Everyone I know, who has this exact same phone, including me, has the same problem with the battery. It takes more than 24 hrs to recharge and dies within next 12 hours."
2,Poor battery!!,I am really disappointed to see how long the battery lasts on this phone. I had a panasonic cordless phone before (don't remember which model) and was very impressed with the battery life. That was the main reason I bought this one but it last for only 1 day in standby mode.
2,"Beware! Wrong color, wrong price!","I've been wearing ""oatmeal"" colored GoldToe Cotton Fluffies for years, and bought some of these here online because my local store is out of stock.How hard could it be, the picture looks exactly like the socks I wear, and the color matches the saved label. Two seconds later, the socks are on their way. A short three days later, the socks arrive, and.. Wait a minute, these don't look anything like the socks I ordered! These aren't the varigated two-color ""oatmeal"" I was expecting, they're just off-white tan. I can live with that, but the kicker was they came with stickers announcing the price was less than what I paid!The socks have an attached very legit-looking GoldToe labels say ""Made in Pakistan"", style 565S, color 027 ""oatmeal"", and also have a cute ""3 Pair, $16.00"" sticker (I paid almost $7/pair with shipping). Either GoldToe's quality is slipping, or these are some kind of overstock/reject/odd-lot. Buyer beware!"
1,Gold Toe Men's Cotton Fluffies Casual Sock,"I also was shocked when only one pair of socks arrived. Normally there is three pair to a pack. What especially confused me is that the price was $9.95 (which is what one would pay for a three pair pack at a TJ Maxx's). When I opened them, the sticker price was only $7.00. What a deal. Normally I am happy with Amazon. This time I feel they won."
2,Not good socks,"I wore Gold toes years ago and remember them as very high quality durable socks. I discontinued using them because i started wearing different styles than the crew/white/standard. Now after trying these fluffies i think i remember why i stopped liking the gold toes. perhaps they sold the co. or came under new management. in anyt case these socks have no stretch in the elastic, making them basically worthless. yippee."
2,One pair,Received one pair of socks. Wish I had known that before ordering. Seems that others people received different number of socks. I guess I will be buying socks from physical stores.
2,denim heather is not blue like the icon,"The denim heather sock is a grayish color and not the same as pictured. It is pictured as ""blue"". So, if you want the socks to match your jeans, they won't."
4,Great Game!,"This is a great game. Some aspects of it are a little annoying, but for a true sierra classic, it's a great game worth having. Now I say all that to say this. Unless you feel that you just have to own it on Floppy disk, then I recommend not buying it. Download it free. Just use your favorite search engine to search ""abandonware"" and download it for free!Just thougth I'd give the heads up."
4,very pleased with Moosewood!,I like this cookbook very much. It gives lots of little hints about how to modify recipes to make them a little different. Very easy to follow insructions provided about when to start what part of the preparation and cooking. I have tried about 10 of the recipes and like most of them. I usually spice them up a little and my family likes it too.
4,excited,I have been wanting this cookbook for some time because my 52 yr old husband had a heart attack so we've completely changed our eating habits and this book has so many wonderful healthy dishes. The delivery was quick and the book is in really good condition. (-:
4,So good it was worth buying twice,"I had the soft cover edition of this cookbook on the shelf for years. It had become so used during that time that it was hopelessly dog eared and falling apart. I replaced it with the hard cover version which should last a little longer.I'm not a vegetarian, but we do enjoy preparing vegetarian meals for the family several times a week. Many of the recipes in this book are hearty, satisfying, and delicious even for omnivores such as we."
3,Sometimes Disappointing but Often Right on the Money!,"I have to admit that I'm not a fan of all the recipes in this book. I do not find a pot full of mixed vegetables all that interesting. That said--there are some wonderful recipes mixed in with the less interesting ones that redeem the whole cookbook. The sweet potato black bean burritos are THE BEST! I make them for freinds every so often, and they're always a hit. The Tropical Gazpacho is the best gazpacho recipe I have. I am also a fan of the Jamaican Jerk Tofu. Maybe it isn't the very best cookbook in my collection, but it definitely has a place there."
2,Dishes not very flavorful,"I cook lowfat stuff all the time, but I have been very unimpressed with the taste of the Moosewood main dishes. Mostly they are bland.Actually, taking ""regular"" recipes and leaving out the oil or meat has gotten me much better tasting results."
5,Creative healthy cooking for everybody...the best!,"To quote from the header for ""Mushroom Sesame Tofu Stew"": ""Plain, simple, satisfying...a dish that somehow becomes greater than the sum of its parts..."" This tells the story. The book is easy to follow, with generally common ingredients that blend together to make wonderful, tastes. As a not-so-serious cook, who is NOT vegetarian, but looking for ""healthy"" food, this book was a find that I will treasure. Recipe analysis and cross-referencing for ingredients round out an excellent diverse selection of recipes, 300 in all. Aromatic Middle Eastern Tofu-stuffed peppers, Banana muffins made with rolled oats, New England Squash Soup... Can't wait to explore the rest...yum!"
1,blech!,"Yuck! I tried a few recipes from this book, and they were just terrible. They ranged from bland and flavorless to downright inedible. The food may be low-fat and healthy, but if nobody will eat it, it won't do you much good! My recommendation: ""The 15-minute vegetarian gourmet"" by Paulette Mitchell, which is a wonderful book."
1,Beach,I was not very impressed with the recipes. You know pictures say a thousand words. Kind of a boring cookbook.Would not buy one of these cookbooks again.
3,"informative, but often hard work for little reward","There's a lot that's good about this book - the nutritional information, the homey and personal feel of the prose, the inspiration to try new things - but I do end up disappointed fairly often. A couple of recipes are favourites - the breakfast section generally, for example - but a lot of the dinner recipes are really pretty complicated for mid-week meals, and then turn out not to be too different from what I could have achieved in far less time with fewer ingredients. A book to try for a few new ideas, but not one to base your new diet on."
5,My favorite from Moosewood!,"The recipes in ""Low-Fat Favorites"" aren't time-consuming to prepare like the classic Moosewood recipes, making them more weeknight friendly. There are many ""tricks"" to make a dish seem creamy or cheesy without adding any cream or cheese -- all satisfaction, no fat!I made Roasted Vegetables Caribbean Style for a potluck the other night to rave reviews. It was easy to prepare and SO good (page 227).The ""Menu Suggestions"" feature and the indication of time the recipe takes to prepare are great for planning family dinners or dinner parties, and are included with each recipe."
2,Disappointing,"I enjoyed many of the recipes in The New Moosewood Cookbook, so I thought that I might have luck with this one too. Not so. Every recipe I tried turned out mediocre at best. I have given up attempting recipes from this book for fear of having a ruined dinner. I have held on to it though because it does have some interesting nutritional information and inventive tips like using ground rice to thicken a soup. Beyond this though, I can't recommend this book to anyone."
2,Good only for main dishes,"I found the main dishes in this book to be primarily good, although some require a multitude of ingredients that are not normally on hand. Every baked good I tried was awful! The biscotti was so hard I could not even bite into it! The bundt cake was soggy and heavy. I was disappointed and understand why used copies are $4.00!"
5,It Is Wonderful!,"I really love this Vitamin C with Rose Hips. I take it daily as a supplement. The price is great and the quality wonderful. In our house, when we feel a cold or flu bug coming on, we take this three times per day along with garlic oil capsules. It works like magic on our immune system - usually the bug is gone in three days!"
1,too big to swallow,I didn't anticipate how big the tabs were and I just could not swallow tehma nd didn't return thema nd so ended up wasting money and maybe; a good product!
3,Great right up until chapter 4,"I'm a programmer familiar with SQL and needing to learn PL/SQL to use with SQL Navigator and SQL*Plus. Chapter 4 suddenly assumes you'll need to work with the internet and all of the examples deal with setting up interactive web pages. That would be great for a shop using that kind of interface. In my position, I don't have access to servers that would post a page, so the book now sits on a shelf until it becomes relevant. There were no alternate examples. I was pretty disappointed. Other than that, a great book!"
1,"Learning Oracle Maybe, But Not PL/SQL","I've been developing with Sybase and SQL Server for about 5 years with very limited experience with Oracle in that time. I purchased this book hoping to get up to speed on the differences between Oracle's PL/SQL and the Sybase/Microsoft T-SQL syntax. From the title this book seemed appropriate for the job. In short, while the book might be an adequate, albeit SLOW, introduction to Oracle, it covers very little actual PL/SQL.If you are a programer/engineer/dba looking to ""learn Oracle PL/SQL"", interested in practical applications of such fundamental topics as constraints, foreign keys, indexes, joins, cursors, views, triggers, corelated subqueries and the like, look elsewhere. Don't take my word for it--take a peek at the index or table of contents and you'll see that the focus of this book has very little to do with PL/SQL."
4,Making memories,"This is a great ""low-tech"" adventure to share with your kids. It's a great product that is still amazing. It's a stress-free activity for you, too."
2,super small,not at all what i was expecting .... in fact i found the same thing at my local dollar store a couple months later after i had already bought this
5,We love them,We have been looking for Shrinky Dinks at the stores and could not find them so we were excited to find them on your website.
4,Fun retro craft,This is a fun craft for a rainy day. Still amazing to see these shirk and the color intensify!
3,Good but missing pieces,My kids had fun coloring and shrinking the pieces but the box was missing all the beads. My daughter was disappointed in not being able to make the jewelry the box showed on the front.
1,Disappointing,I ordered this for my daughter for Christmas. The box must have been opened and the beads fell out when we tried to make the jewelry. A waste of money!!
3,Wish It was bigger,"This sprouter is a good alternative to the plastic ones. I have two reasons why I would only give it a 3 rating. It is pretty expensive for what it is, and I wish the sprouting trays were bigger. Other than that it works well, cleans up well and grows any king of sprout."
3,"very nice, but useless","Well made, and clearly machined by excellent manufacture - but with key fobs containing the essential lock and unlock, panic and trunk open buttons, this becomes redundant. I wish it were not so, but it just gets in the way of other gear in my pocket."
4,Monkey Movie,Bought for my grandson for a very long car ride to another state kept him entertained the whole way. Loved all the movies.
5,4 pack a bargain,"Curious George: Monkey Collection, Vol. 1My grandson is almost two and walks in my door every morning saying ""Want George?"" After a few days of constant pleas, I logged on to Amazon.com to choose a DVD. The 4 pack was perfect and a good value. Thirty-Two episodes allows me to put one DVD on in the bedroom to play continually. Each day we can watch a new DVD and enjoy George nonstop. Educational and amusing-we love it!"
4,This Is Amazing Death Metal! old school.,"I have the 16 Track Digipack with ""Beyond the unknown"" & ""Serpent Temptation"".I think it is available here. Anyway this is Death / Trash 1990's style, detuned and dirty. The other band called Incubus came later. i don't know with the styles in America it doesn't take much to shove corporate Rock down throat's so i can't blame this band in changing their name.If your a fan of Death metal especially of the Florida variant i would recommend this fine album. it is available in Europe as a digipack but it has no extra's like credits etc.., Nuclear blast is the label."
4,Wait a minute...,"All these reviews of the Album state that this is NOT the real Incubus. Considereing they had the name first and been around a lot longer they qualify as ""the real Incubus."" If your looking for some Old School thrash/death this is one of the better albums realesed from that genre of metal. Great production, catchy beats, and killer riffs from the swamps of Louisiana..."
1,What's wrong with you people?,"Look, I haven't heard this Incubus, so I won't comment on them, but I just want to say that it saddens me that you people are dismissing the other, more well-known Incubus as ""nu-metal"" (which they are not and never were) or as a trendy MTV band. Trust me, I hate those types of bands too, but Incubus are so much more than that. They have truly great songwriting skills, a unique sound and style, interesting and emotional lyrics, and their albums are very eclectic and diverse. Obviously you people are just metalheads who don't like anything that doesn't have a lot of screaming and guitar distortion. I mean I like some heavy bands too but I like other stuff too. I don't know about this band, but I know the other Incubus are a truly talented, innovative band that should not be bunched in with bands like Linkin Park and Puddle of Mudd"
1,THRASH METAL SUCKS!!!,"I dont know what are you guys talking about but theres only ONE true band thats called incubus, and is NOT thrash metal. i feel sorry for those metalheads that dont like incubus, but c'mon, we all know that this metal IMPOSTOR is NOTHING compared with the real one, the one that relesed all those COOL records such as Fungus Amongus, EnjoyIncubus, Make Yourself and especially S.C.I.E.N.C.E. Besides the REAL incubus has the rights for the name, so the impostors had to change its name into ""incubus nightmares"", or some stupid name like that. Believe me, guys, ive heard this awful record and it really [bad]... its mainly distorted screamings and riffs along with plain STUPID and MEDIOCRE metal lyrics. If you want some real music better spend your money more wisely on some real incubus Cds... you wont regrest it... unless of course youre some metalhead with poor taste for music... but i tell you, this is a terrible waste of money!"
3,Very descriptive and scientific,"What can I expect? I was thinking more along the lines of Bill Bryson's A Brief History of Everything book when picking this one up. A little dry and detailed to say the least, but if you're into that then enjoy."
4,good or bad,"I did not know East Germany has produced movies like this one exploring homosexuality in a high school teacher, Phillip.Many beautiful scenes and touching moments. The director was trying hard to explore the suppressed inner world struggles of the dual identity role, almost in all of us.My problem with the movie is that many things were missing or the director forgot.First Mattias, portrayed by Dirk Kummer, was such a success, but before the end, it was lost, after he found Phillips has a wife. If Phillip was indeed his dream man and had a huge impact on his life, his late behavor in the bar was rather stranger.Phillip's figure was successfully presented in the first part of the movie, but in the last few moments when he finally was coming out, he became a weirdo.In the end, I did not find that life is getting better for our human mankind from this movie, but rather depressing and a complete waste, which may not be what the director wanted to tell me."
2,"bla, bla, bla","Very disappoiting. I went through the whole movie expecting something to happen and all of a sudden - oops, has it ended ?!! Sometimes, too much talk, but maybe it'll make sense for a Berlin guy, mainly from that time. Struggling to come out, but come on!"
1,Dreadful movie!!,"I consider the Video movie, ""Coming Out"", to be probably the WORST one I have even seen!It appeared that the editor had pick up filmed segments and spliced them together in any way he felt like it! The so-called'plot' made no sense what so ever! And it had no ending...it simply stopped!The only reason I watched it to the end, I had bought it; I wanted to see if it was ever pulled together. The anwser was a resounding NO!!"
3,slow. poor. only deeeeep feelings,"i don't know why this film got any awards. i might skip the firt part of the movie, it was about nothing. the most important things happens on the second part.""Straight"" gay guy fall in love to gay guy. When gay guy find that his friend married, he left him. ""Straight"" gay guy understands his nature, but its too late...Thats all. No ideas, no things that I can think about after movie... It's just a slow file with deep feelings sometime. No humor."
4,Torn between two worlds,"I found this movie be a surprisingly sensitive treatment of what is still a difficult subject, especially for those involved. The acting seemed realistic and life-like, not staged. I was disappointed that the audio was poorly done. Most of the time the words were barely audible and, when they were, they were so slurred and mumbled as to be barely intelligible (and I'm no stranger to the language).I wish there were more movies like this and, some day, perhpas someone will give us a slightly happier ending. Maybe?"
5,Perfect Gay Movie,"This movie touched all bases about coming out. It was a wonderful film to watch. Entertaining and funny. A film that makes you say ""WOW"""
5,The BEST bagged tea I've ever had,"My friend brought me back a box of this stuff from Ireland. I loved it so much I actually switched from being a morning coffee drinker to a morning tea drinker (Barry's ONLY!). Strong, but not bitter at all. Great flavor. A little milk & honey and I'm in heaven. I absolutely love it."
3,Average tea,"Acceptable tea, with a light gold colouring, and weighty single bags. Despite the amount of tea per bag, the tea is not very strong, even with a long 5+min soaking. As such, it will not accept too much cream or sugar either. This is fine in itself, as the tea has a nice flavour, a blend of Assam and Kenyan teas. Its taste and strength are similar to PG Tips or more closely Typhoo. Makes a pleasant, late evening tea, but was expecting more out of this popular Irish blend. For those preferring a much stronger, darker tea you may want to find another brand."
5,One of the great black teas,"I actually first learned about Barry's tea in a novel I was reading. It piqued my interest enough to try it, but it wasn't available at our local supermarkets, so I ordered a box from Amazon. I'm very pleased with the tea, it's a very robust but smooth, full-bodied black tea that I love to drink straight or with a few drops of lemon juice. I brew a couple of cups a day in a Mr. Coffee machine that I use only for tea, and it makes a great hot drink."
2,"Barry's Gold Blend Tea, 80-Count Tea Bags",The tea was a bit too bold for me. It is probably for a more seasoned tea drinker than myself.
5,Discovered this stuff motorcycling in Ireland,"After a day motorcycling around the Ring of Kerry in Ireland, we stopped at a restaurant, soaking wet and chilled to the bone from the ever present rain. I had a cup of this very tea and I was sold forever. Granted, it was a situation like when you're starved and a soda cracker is a meal. I found this on Amazon when I got home to the US and enjoy it all the time. I haven't found anything like it in the US. Very good flavor. Highly recommend Barry's Breakfast tea as well.PS: I know this sounds like something out of the J. Peterman catalog (from the Seinfeld Show) but this is really how I stumbled onto this tea! ;-) I'm reminded of that trip every time I make a cup."
3,Barrys Gold Blend,I thinks lyons gold blend is by far a better tea. Barrys is to weak flavored in my opinion. I thought i would give Barrys another try since it had been awhile since i last had it. Im going to stick with Lyons Gold Blend from now on.
5,best tea ever!!!!,talk about an instant like tea!!!Full of falvour at any stage of brewinggreat for Ice tea minial tea bag usage
5,Great read!,"I couldn't out this book down. I thought I would just read a chapter or two before bed, boy was I wrong. I had to know what happened to Marco, Payton and their children. I loved that Payton was so strong in spite of all that she was feeling and going through. Porter did an excellent job of making feel all the emotions the characters were feeling. I found myself even tearing up at certain points. I loved this book!"
4,Marco's Pride by Jane Porter,"After a failed marriage, Peyton moves back home to raise her twin daughters on her own. An illness brings her back to Italy to her ex-husband, Marco, in hopes he will take care of his daughters while she goes through cancer treatments. But, just being back with him again brings back all kinds of feelings she tried to put behind her. Marco is engaged to be married to someone else now. This book goes through a lot of emotions from Peyton and Marco as they try to figure out what they will do next. I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone who loves a good romance."
4,Marco's Pride,"I'm always looking for a good reunion romance. And I wasn't disappointed with Marco and Payton's story. At the beginning, I was wondering what kept them apart and then I was wondering what was going to bring them back together. I think I'll be reading this one more than once."
3,story,this seems like an elementary book on story telling. It appears to be well thought out and written. That's about it.
3,"Good book, for some...","I was not very impressed with this book. It was purchased as a gift for me. It was not a bad book, and if you are looking for a book to get started in story telling maybe this is the one for you.I was looking for something a bit different I admit; and my wife bought it and thought it would be helpful. Lots of great little starter stories for the novice storyteller, mostly children type stories if I remember. I did appreciate the detail given in reference to the possible gesturing and emphasis on certain key phrases when telling the stories.Again this was not a bad book at all just not what I needed, for the project i was working on. This is a Good book for a beginning story teller that might be looking for some pointers and a few nice stories to build his or her story bank."
4,Great resource for beginner's comfortable with similar styles,"This is only the second storytelling guide I've read. I'm fairly new to storytelling, and I found this guide full of good tips and ideas. The included stories are not really my style and don't fit what I do, but they made for good practice.Most of the storytelling tips referenced children. Even though my audiences are mostly adult, I found plenty of good information."
3,Some good content...lots of pages wasted on works cited/footnotes,"I loved the sample stories at the end...very useful for us beginners. The reason it only gets 3 stars is because 25% of the book is bibliography/footnote, and because most of the good ideas in this book are available in more useful detail in ""Creative Storytelling..."" by Jack McGuire. McGuire's book is geared toward telling to children, but it contains a great deal of info on the processes behind storytelling. It gives you some great steps and ideas for creating, remembering, and telling your own stories."
4,Good but not great,This album is good but it lacks some of the features of later albums that allows the listener to be overwhelmed by sound. Don't get me wrong it flat out rocks but in my opinion it is missing something.
3,great for reflux,Worked great in the beginning for my daughters reflux. But as she got a little bigger I had trouble keeping her in place. I still prefer the boppy to the cozy me. But I have found other uses now that my daughter is beginning to sit supported. She has more freedom to move but still remains more stable.
2,Non-washable = disaster,Crayola markers are great. Except when they are NOT washable. I purchase markers for my kids all of the time and wasn't paying attention with these. That red stain on my shirt will not come out. Buy the washable markers instead and enjoy them.
1,This phone stinks!!!,"I paid over $100 at a warehouse club and I have a $12 cordless phone that is much more reliable. The battery life was ok for the first two months and then it all of a sudden died. Now, the phone will hold a charge for less than five minutes.This phone was a HUGE waste of money."
4,Why all the bad reviews???,I've had this phone for about a year and a half now and except for having to replace the battery I haven't had any problems. The clarity and range is excellent and the speakerphone on the base is one of the best I've ever used.The handset is built tough. It's been dropped a couple of times and keeps on going.The only gripe I have is the fact that it doesn't have a MUTE button. What were they thinking?!?Overall a very good phone.
1,This seller is dishonest.,"This seller sended miss parts in my order after I opened the package. I try to email them, they would not reply.Do not buy their products."
1,Horrible Battery Life,"Do not buy this phone. The battery life is horrible. The battery lasts one good hour when new. After a month, the battery life reduces to minutes after 6 hours charged. How may batteries will one need to stock up for a bad phone? You cannot depend on this bad phone. Imagine this is the only phone you have in the house and during a call to 911 ... you got cut off!"
1,"Useless, battery FATAL fault","This phone could be useful if Panasonic had thought first of putting a GOOD battery, not the piece of junk those people installed on it. Won't hold charge for more than 20 minutes of conversation, leave it standby out the charger, and the battery WILL be dead after 3 hours, 4 tops."
1,next,"This is a duckbill platypus of a phone.Paper weight, chew toy, vibrator? Maybe.Phone? Forget about it."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE,"Being a bit of a techno-geek, I waited a long time for this phone to come out, since at the time, it was the first phone to have 2.4 ghz AND answering machine, PLUS it had really cool styling.What a mistake! This is hands down, the absolute worst phone I've ever gotten. The sound quality was very good at first, then steadily went downhill and within 6 months became pure static. The answering machine (and I've owned 3 answering machines and 4 office mailbox-type answering services) is the absolute worst answering machine I've ever used. You can't even change the time without consulting a manual. It is absolutely inconceivable to me that anyone, letalone Panasonic, could make an answering machine this bad. I remember having a Panasonic tape machine 10 years ago that was superior to this.You are much better off getting some $ phone/answering machine combo than this piece of junk. Don't be fooled by how cool it looks!"
1,Don't waste your time & $$'s,I have owned this phone for a little over one year. It is in a box in the attic!! I finally had enough. This is the worst phone. It all started out good & went to bad after a few months. Please read the problems in past reviews. I have had them all.
1,Terrible phone,"It worked fine for a month or two then it started flashing ""out of range""...didn't matter how close you were to the phone, even right next to the base unit. So we called their customer service, who told us to take out the batteries, unplug the phone, wait. Then turn it back on. Occasionally, this would work. Most of the time it wouldn't. Now it never works. Customer service has no advice other than unplug it.Plus, our greeting on the answering machine sounds like we're in a tin can. Terrible phone."
1,"Hate it, it's going to the trash can",I had the previous model without the keypad on the console. But I think it's similar on all features. ... Out of Range signals even when I stand 1 feet away from the console. Sound quality poor. Too much static noise. Not recommended.
2,Unsatisfied battery life,"I purchased this phone in Sept. of 2002 and already the battery only stays charged for about 40 minutes, it was advertized to last about 3.5 hours of talk time before recharging.I should have kept my cheaper AT&T 900MHZ model,which I had no problems with keeping a charge."
1,I wish you had a ZERO STAR RATING!,THIS PHONE IS THE BIGGEST RIP OFF I HAVE HAD OF ANY ELECTRONIC PURCHASE. I THOUGHT THE PANASONIC BRAND PLUS ALL THE HYPE SURROUNDING THIS PHONE MEANT IT WOULD AT LEAST FUNCTION PROPERLY IF NOT OUTSTANDINGLY...BUT THE BATTERY LIFE RARELY EXCEEDS 1/2 AN HOUR AND HAS CAUSED MANY DROPPED CALLS. ONLY THE SPEAKERPHONE IS WORTH USING UNLESS YOU WANT TO HANG UP ON THE OTHER PARTY. DONT BUY IT!!!
4,Favorite Phone Ever.,"I was kind of shocked reading all the bad reviews on this phone. So much so, that I would not have bought it back when I did if I had read them. Thing is, I don't even think the internet was invented way back then! I have had this phone forever and it still works great. Even after dropping it multiple times and braking the antenna off it still works just fine. I have the black model (KX-TG2583CB), and have had no paint rub off. I never did use the answering machine, so can't comment on that.The only reason I am retiring it is that I can no longer buy batteries for it where I live, and it is cheaper for my to buy a poorly made new one, than to pay my now huge cell-phone bills. The new Panasonic KX-TGA470C is what I am now stuck with."
2,Not a phone for your home office,This phone cannot be used within 10 feet of a computer which makes it unsuitable for a home office telephone. The reception was initially clear but degraded in a short time developing lots of interference. Despite following the instructions from the technical support line to factory reset the phone we are not able to remove the static. The phone is basically useless and we're starting over. Rather a high function phone for just home usage. They need to solve the problem with the 2.4 and electronics.
1,When it works it is great!,"Range = Unbelievably excellent.Answer machine BROKE within 3 months!Says ""Out of range"" 1/2 the time when standing NEXT to base.Static all the time now that it is 1 year old.Product looks great , works great (When Working)I own 2 of them and PAINT RUBS OFF within 3 moinths ande 1 LCD screen is burned yellow & green....Why?Panasonics' ""Quality Control"" is LOUSY!"
1,"""New"" Panasonic Phone-KX-TG2583 silver","I have owned Panasonic phones for 15 years now.My last was a large style 900hz.-long range that was going on 8 years old! It just wore out...I purchase the new 2.4hz.-I am VERY DISAPPOINTED...it has lasted exactly 11 days until it will no longer function! Beside's not working the silver finish just chips off with setting the phone back in for charging! Absolutely the worst phone I have ever owned... I am hoping to find one of the older model # KXTC1741-white Panasonic's- I have one of these without the answering machines,and it is excellent! It has been dropped,gotten wet,and been chewed on by my mastiff-puppy.This phone is the ""Hummer"" of Panasonics! Well off to find a new phone- good luck...eh?"
2,This phone is driving me crazy,"I bought this phone at considerable expense because of its features, the brand name, and assurances from a sales person that the quality was excellent. It has persistently been problematic. Every time I pick up the phone, I hear very loud and obnoxious static. That used to fade away when I began a call, but now it persists, making it painful to listen to callers. Another minor annoyance is the caller ID light which continually flashes for no good reason, instead of simply staying on. I wish I'd bought the cheaper Vtech, or maybe got a Siemens."
3,Noise in Answering Machine?,"I liked the sound quality of this phone. I recently bought a 1733B Panasonic and people were telling me the sound was poor. But with this 2583 there was an annoying ""grown sound"", when people would leave messages on the answering machine? The sound was heard between messages. I returned this phone and bought a panasonic KX-TG2563 (which does not have an answering machine). Problem solved!"
2,Short battery life,"The only problem I have with this phone is that the battery goes dead in about one hour of talk time. The owners manual says that the battery is supposed to last longer, but that is only if you are within ten feet of the base. I would get a corded phone if I wanted that limitation. Also the battery is ni-cd, which has to be fully discharged before being charged again. If it had a li-ion battery I would probably give this phone 5 stars."
2,>>--Not good for the money--<<,"I bought the phone because of all the features I was reading about, turns out it was the worst phone I have for the money!The speakerphone acts totally dependent of the handset. If you turn the ringer off on the handset, the ringer on the speakerphone turns off.I program friends/family phone #'s in the handset and when they call, the handset doesn't give me the programmed name with the number, but the caller ID name instead. Sprint's phone is excellent with this feature!Panasonic's sound quality is excellent though! And I love the look! But I'm not willing to spend $... on the look and sound alone!Also, they should make a phone that will not hang up on your party when you want to hold the phone between your head and shoulders to talk. I will be returning this phone to purchase a Siemens, I'm hoping I don't have to write a 2 star review on them.It's 2002 Panasonic, where are you!"
2,"Overpriced, poorly designed, missing features, good sound","At about three times the price of the Panasonic 2 line ""land"" phone it was replacing, I was expecting to find some extra functionality in this new 1 line phone. Biggest bummer was the missing auto-redial (dial until no busy signal) function. Second big bummer was the lack of ""function"" key and lack of functionality on the base unit, making the base unit almost worthless. Programming this phone was counter-intuitive and required the manual even for some of the simpler things. Releasing the locator/intercom key meant hanging up on the conversation in progress on the handset (baddd).Sound quality is quite good."
2,Keypad problem,Had the phone for less than a year and the #1 button on the keypad now has problems accepting the finger press. I have to push down really hard and as a result will dial two 1's.
3,"great phone, but then.........","The phone worked great right out of the box. Best sounding cordless phone I have ever used. I have had the phone for about a year now and if speak for more than five minutes, pure annoying static. Also when I go to make a call, the phone reads ""out of range"", and I'll be sitting right next to the base. I'm sorry to have to get rid of it after only a year, but it just quit working."
1,The battery life is poor.,"I bought this phone...and with the money I paid for it I was definitly expecting a better product. I go away for school so when I do call home I talk on the phone for a little while with my entire family. Well, if you expect on having a 2 hour conversation with someone...forget it!!! This means a full 2 hour conversation or the same amount of time just broken up into smaller conversations if you don't put it on it's charger. The battery life is horrible. My friend bought a cheap phone from [store]and that thing rarely makes it to the base and always gets talked on and the thing never dies. But my phone is always beeping a bit into the conversation...and I do return it to the base. It's a disappointment. Also, if you plan on using a handset...BE CAREFUL...because the other party can barely hear you."
1,Worst Phone I Have Ever Bought,"This phone never really worked. Lousy reception, one hour battery life...the list goes on. Believe me...read the other reviews...don't waste your time and money."
1,"Started great, only lasted 1 year","This phone started out great, no problems, good sound, nice feel, reasonably simple to use. After a couple months, the caller ID features started to only work on occasion. I contacted Panasonic and got nowhere trying to resolve the issue. As the months went on it started to get worse. Now after a year the phone sound is still fine, battery life is getting worse, the caller ID function is simply not working at all (""incoming call"" to everything no ID) and the answering machine speaker is now shot. Can't really make out much of anything unless you turn up the volume to maximum and then just barely. I have now replaced this phone and not with a Panasonic."
1,Piece of Junk,"I bought this phone a year ago and I end up changing the battery already once. The battery was discharging so fast and recently I stopped using the handset completely. Eventhough I charge it whole night, it is not getting charged. The warranty service is also very bad. Fortunately I bought this phone using my Visa Platinum and they covered the full price. Thanks to Visa."
1,Good for one year,"If you are the perosn who changes phone every year, then this is the one. It will start die exaclty after one year as pre-programmed."
4,Overall a Great Phone,I've had this phone for just about two years. I have yet to have a problem with the battery on this phone but I don't constantly keep it off the base. What I like best about this phone is that I can take it up the street to my neighbor's back yard in the summer and get great reception. My neighbor couldn't believe that my phone worked over there. The only complaints I have are that my microwave does interfere with my conversations a little and early on people couldn't hear me loud. The sound was soft. I adjusted it and no one's complained in over a year.I've found this to be a great little phone but now I am looking to purchase a system with expandable handsets since another old phone of mine has had it and this panasonic is the only phone in the house I have right now that works.
3,Okay.,"First of all, I have to say this phone is great for durability. My niece dropped it in the dog's dish and it still came out unscathed.Secondly, the range is really, really good. I haven't tried getting up on the roof with it yet, but I should, just to prove my point.The bad points: It makes annoying beeping noises, and it keeps hanging up on people. If you want a durable phone with a great range, buy it. If you want a phone that will never annoy you, stay away from this one."
2,Decent sound...but.....,"When I originally bought the phone last year, it was to get a good cordless for an urban area that would give me caller-ID and a headset jack (my fmr. Sony phone had neither). While the menu's are somewhat counter-intuitive and the remote call-in system is stinky, I was pretty happy - for awhile. At about the one year mark, the headset jack just >stopped working< - I found out that the phone is pretty uncomfortable to hold on the shoulder. Then, the reception went from >100 ft to ~8 ft. Then the handset mike died - all w/n 1 week! I won't buy it again!"
1,"""Out Of Range"" Problem!! (again)","It was good for a month, then handset shows ""Out Of Range"" all the time (even we stand next to its base). We sold over 30 of them out, but 80% of customers brought them back to refund. Called tech support, just a machine answered and let us hold forever!! No reply at all by using tech support forms in website. We lost at least couple grands from reselling them as a junk and still left some more from weekly returns. No responsible company."
2,Persistent static too,"Surprising to learn in reading these reviews that I am not the only one experiencing problems with constant static and ""Out of Range"" messages while standing next to the base station. It is disappointing that a company the size of Panasonic would manufacture a product of such poor quality. Thank you to the reviewer who provided guidance in how to repair the phone. Has anyone had experience with authorized Panasonic repair?"
2,Fighting detachment,"2 1/2Stupid sonics should play predictably to anyone already invested in emotional electric, if competently enough to avoid parody."
3,Broad Overview,"This book provides a very broad overview of all energy topics. Much of the information could probably be found in a more up-to-date form from the internet. The first section seems straight from the EIA's annual energy report. Do not purchase this book as an day-to-day guide for operations, calculations and benchmarks. Do buy this book if you're looking for a general description of energy topics.I say this as a mechanical engineer as the electrical sections do seem to go into more depth."
4,Scissor sharpener,"Glad I found this. It works fine, but I still would pay a pro to do my best sewing scissors. I also have the knife sharpener from the same company. I would also recommend it."
3,Scissor Sharpener not as good as Knife Sharpener,"Not as good as the knife sharpener. Perhaps because I had already sharpened 10 pairs of scissors with the knife sharpener (it did get them sharp)the scissor sharpener hasn't done anything better. Now my scissors won't cut through a plastic bread bag nor will they cut hair. Maybe I ruined them all with the knife sharpener. At any rate, when I realized the scissors wouldn't cut hair, I immediately ordered the scissor sharpener (and two more knife sharpeners) and it arrived in three days. Unfortunately, I think the damage is already done."
5,Affordable Scissor Sharpener,"Great tool to sharp both average and large size scissors. NO need to discard those old scissors. With a couple of strokes, the scissor to back to the way it was when I first bought it. I bought other affordable scissor sharpeners before this one, they are easier to use and sharpens all my average size scissors. But the prior sharpeners can't handle the larger scissors."
2,Disappointed,"I was hoping for a huge breakthrough in knife sharpening technology, this was not it. Not exactly a precision instrument."
3,not as good as the knife sharpener,I found this product much less easy to use and did not do as good a job of putting an edge on scissors and shears. The knife sharpener is great and i take one with me whenever i travel and am without my chef's choice 3 stage sharpener. The scissors sharpener however wasn't nearly as user friendly. It did improve the edge reasonably well after a while.
1,Not a good product,"I purchased this assuming that it would automatically sharpen at the correct angle for scissors. It did not. The sharpening edge must be manually set by sight on the flat edge of scissors.First pair of scissors I tried it on the flat edge of the scissors to sharpen was so wide that the throat of the sharpener was too narrow to fit in the tool.The second pair of scissors that I tried had the reverse problem. The flat edge to be sharpened was so narrow that I could not see close enough to set the tool at the correct angle.Tool proved completely valueless too me. I would give it a ""0"" if possible"
4,It works but the ad is confusing,The item works and I will keep it. The ad showed a completely different item than what I received.
2,Wait...save your cash!,"I really, really wanted to get this DVD...been waiting for NFL films to put together footage of the 1950's & 60's. But I was less then satisfied, anything on this DVD can be seen on TV, ESPN and now on the NFL channel. It's over produced with lots of talking which is OK if back up with video that last more then 30 seconds....each volume lasts 41 minutes, so you get only about two hours, but with lots of repetition. Bottom line- this is not for the serious fan...watch it on TV and not waste your money like I did."
5,These Rock!,Hey Funky Dudes of Football:vTHIS DVD rocks......i mean some of the best highlights i have ever seen. Where do they get this stuff. I was on the floor roaring with mojo nixon and other bits of the old gridiron.JACK E. JETTTHE JACK E. JETT SHOW
1,listed wrong were not the right pads,sent the wrong pads and was really hard to get them exchanged not listed correctly in the item description i would have returned them but it got to complicated for the return
4,Hitch Lock,"We have been very pleased with this hitch lock. My only complaint, and the reason for knocking off one star, is that the dust cover over the key socket fell apart the first or second trip. Either put something on there that is going to last or don't bother putting anything on there at all. Not a big deal. The unit is solid and easy to use."
2,Cheesy,"This video shows you some of the highlights of Maui, but the narrator gives pretty cheesy narration. The quality of the video is not great and when he was shooting the camera moves much too fast at times and makes you dizzy. This worked great the first time, but would freeze in spots when I showed it a second time. The ""Waterfall Hunter"" sounds pretty full of himself."
2,Beware of the static!,"Even though this phone has plenty of features for the price, I must warn you about the terrible static. The default ""channel"" for this phone is so full of static, you have to stop your conversation, press the left side of the large toggle button in hopes that you get a clear channel. I don't know how some of the reviewer's have ""crystal clear connections""; I certainly have had the opposite experience."
2,Intermittent static which was very annoying!,Good phone except for one thing -- static that would come and go. With some conversations there was absolutely no static whatsover and with other conversations I had nothing but static. I am planning to return it tomorrow.
3,Bad voice quality...,"This phone has the typical Panasonic characteristics: good looking, solid feeling, feature rich, and good worksmanship. However, this model uses digital transmission, probably a ADPCM-based digital vocoder, so voice will ""clip"" and fade in and out from time to time when it is hit with radio interference. Also, it takes a few seconds for the ADPCM vocoder to ""adapt"" to the radio interference to adjust modulation, which is to clear up voice. It's pretty irritating when part of your voice is chopped... On a good note, the answering machine works great and sounds very clear. One last thing, Panasonic removed ""rapid charge"" feature from the 2002 product line up, so it will take 15-17 hours to charge up a battery that lasts 5 hours."
2,Unwieldy user interface,"I was not happy with this phone and returned it. I found the answering machine to be very clumsy. After listening to messages, I would push erase, and the machine would say, ""Press erase to blah, blah, blah."" I would press erase again, and it would say something similiar. I had to press erase three times just to erase messages. At my house, I lose electricity often due to thunderstorms, and resetting the clock on this thing was very obscure. I had to use the manual every time as you must reset the clock from the handset. The keystrokes were impossible to know without the manual, and the machine did not have a built in guide like many do. The phone quality itself was nothing impressive. Static, with an unusual timber to the person's voice that made it sound pinched. I have never had a Panasonic product that satisfied me, and was once again reminded of why I have bought nothing of theirs in over a decade."
1,DO NOT buy this product,"Works fine until a second phone is picked up on either end of the call. Then, the phone turns into an echo chamber. This is a BAD BAD product. Do not waste your time or money."
1,Should be recalled,"Bought this phone in August of 2001. It no longer works. The quality of reception was less than good. It popped often sounding like an electrical short. Looking at the warranty, it will probably cost more to get it fixed than what it is worth. Labor is covered for 90 days while the parts are for a year. Postage and labor will certainly cost more than this lifeless mass is worth. Maybe we are just lucky or maybe you will be if you do not choose to buy this phone."
1,"Design = 5 stars, Execution = 0 stars","First off, if I could give this phone a rating for design, it would be a ""5"". Very nice features, simple to use. Unfortunately it is not well put together.This is the second version of this phone I have purchased. First I bought the KXTC1501B (the previous model). It worked great except after a couple months, it stopped charging. Some mechanical problem. So, since the economy was in a nosedive, I just bought this new model, the KXTC1503B.This phone also worked great for a while. Then one day it coughed up a digital problem. The answering machine stopped working. The phone got an echo problem. Eventually the microphone stopped working entirely.So, buy at your own risk. I am 0 for 2.(BTW, I came up with a white trash solution for the problem. I charge the battery in the new phone, then transfer the charged battery to the old phone, which works fine.)"
5,FINE PHONE AT A BARGAIN,"This telephone gives you so much for so little. It is a no brainer to setup, as it is already pre-set. Simply plug it in, charge the battery, make a few very minor adjustments to your preferences, and you have a fine quality phone, with pre-recorded highly professional messages, you select from. The buttons are very easy to push. The ringer has a sweet mellow tone, quick & convenient settings to make immediate adjustments for all of your needs. The handset is trim, light weight and very comfortable to hold, and the speaker phone feature works beautifully. A telephone like this with all of these great features, plus many more. It's Panasonic at it's best ~ what more could you ask for? You will be very satisfied and impressed with this purchase. The best phone I have ever owned and I have had many many phones. CAN'T GO WRONG WITH THIS TOP QUALITY PANASONIC CORDLESS SPEAKER, MEGA-FEATURE PHONE! BUY IT ~ I'M GLAD I DID!!"
1,Don't buy this phone!!,"I listened to reviewers about a year ago (most were positive) and bought this phone - and it's been nothing but trouble. I wish I'd waited more time, as the most recent reviews echo my feelings about this phone..which is that it's a real LEMON! Yes, it's got a speaker phone, which is great -- but this positive is more than outweighed by the terrible reception - people's voices fade in and out - and the people on the other end of the phone miss entire words and sentences when you speak. Overall, just awful. I always run and switch to the other phone, which is (a) older (b) less ""sophisticated"" and (c) was much cheaper"
1,"Works fine for a while, then forget it...","I purchased this same version (last model) of the Panasonic phone just over a year ago. The number pad now works randomly, causing us great frustration as well as many wrong numbers. I have contacted their customer support many times (via email), and have yet to receive any response.If you are looking for a phone that will last you a couple of years, then I would recommend that you do not purchase this phone. I don't recall EVER having any problems with the old rotary phones...do you?P.S. If you answer the phone, and the caller has dialed the wrong number...perhaps now, you'll know why."
4,"Cute toy, suction good enough",My six month old son enjoys this toy a lot. When I put it on his high chair tray he can sometimes break the suction after a few minutes -- but that's what I would expect. It works better if the suction cup is dampened.
2,its OK,I'm not sure if its because my daughter is only almost 4 months but the toys does not really hold her attention very well. She will look at it and touch it but it does not curb her from wanting me to pick her up. The suction has its good days and bad days. Usually when I wet the bottom before I put it on the highchair it sticks better.
2,Sucky Suction,"My 6 month old can break the suction and throw this to the ground in approximately 5 section. The suction is not strong enough to hold the toy in place on the high chair. As a toy, it's fine, but we were looking for something we didn't have to keep picking up. This is not it."
2,eh - not impressed,"My baby enjoys the toy enough, but I bought it specifically bc I was looking for a product I could stick to the tray on her high chair so she would have something to entertain her that she couldn't throw to the floor in two seconds. The suction cup is basically useless. I do NOT recommend this item if the suction cup is one of the features that attracts you to it."
1,doesn't suction and baby's hands get stuck!!!,"I bought this specifically for the suction cup base...well it only suctions to my daughters high chair tray or any other hard surface for around 20 seconds then, its tossed right on the floor with the rest of her toys. As well she seems to get her fingers stuck in the toy and then screams, I had to take it away from her because she kept getting them stuck, I was worried she would bruise her hands or worse. If the suction base worked at all I could place it just within her reach so her hands wouldn't get stuck in it, and she could still spin it. I am very disappointed with this toy and as well have forwarded my concerns to the manufacturer. I hope this and all the other reviews help any other parents looking to buy this."
1,It wouldn't suction!,"I got this product for my daugther because she is in the "" I'm going to throw everything on the floor."" So I thought OH great this will suction to her high chair. OH NO I was wrong. This didn't suction to anything!!!! I had to stuff it in the cup holder for it to stay in place. She loves the toy part but there is no suction at all."
2,bad as a suction cup toy,"Like one of the other reviewer pointed out....toy easily detaches from the suction cup. That totally defeats the purpose of having a suction cup toy. I suction the toy to her high chair and she grabs the toy out of the base, leaving the suction cup still attached to the tray. I did give it two stars because my 5 month old enjoys the toy (the fun music was a surprise to me)...it just doesn't work for the purpose I bought it for - to stay put."
2,"Interesting, but painful!","My daughter is 5-months old and finds the spinning features of this toy captivating. If she is fussy, it helps settle her down.Like most readers, I found the suction cup worthless and don't even use it anymore. I just have this as a rattle.The problem is that at her age, her movements are not controlled. Thus, whenever she tries to shake it around like a rattle, she inevitably hits herself (or me!) on the head. Being that it is a heavy plastic toy, it's quite painful when you are hit with it. She also likes to use it as a teether, which makes me nervous about all the plastic."
2,Not the same Mark Alan,"I agree with the former reviewer's opinion of the Mark Alan who regularly performs in Eugene, Oregon. However, I'm fairly certain that this is not the same Mark Alan. The clips don't sound at all like him and the picture doesn't look like him.I gave this cd one star for each of its songs because a rating is required in order to post a review, but I've never listened to the actual cd, so I don't know what it deserves. I merely wanted to post here to try to straighten out the identity. I'm sure the Eugene Mark Alan doesn't want to take credit for this cd if it's not his."
1,Not my cup of tea.,"This CD was given to me assuming it was the Mark Alan of Eugene. The wonderfully talented Mark Alan of Eugene Or, can be seen in Portland on April 9th at the White Eagle. If you never been to a performance, don't miss him. If you've seen and heard him, then I need say no more. See you there. Anyone know if he's produced anything since Brown Sugar Biscuits?"
3,Not a bad watch - interesting with interviews from her family,I was actually looking for flicks on FTM not MTF persons but thought this one looked interesting - and it was. She is very honest and the interviews and comments from her friends and family are very fantastic - it portrays not just her story but how her choices and her 'new' lifestyle effected her loved ones. It made me think of asking my family questions on their feelings about my transition. This doco got me to think and yet it also told a good story. Not at all disappointed I own this movie - definitely interesting to see the story from the other side of the coin.
5,Electronic Commerce and International Taxation,This is the most detailed work on the subject. It provides a detailed analysis of the various policy alternatives with respect to electonic commerce and taxation.
5,Review of Autopsy with Michael Baden,I found this to be excellent ..typical with the HBO Series of the same title that comes on periodocially. Well worth buying and watching. Have not found it in any stores as of yet. JCS
3,"Can one be to much of a ""feminist""?","Don't get me wrong, I thoroughly enjoy Amanda Quick's works, but this time I was left feeling so-so. The main character, Lavinia Lake is a woman on her own, determined to be utterly independent. I applaud an author who makes a female character who has her own mind, especially in a setting such as this, when the burgeoning dissatisfaction with traditional feminine roles is starting to show. Unfortunately this time through, Lavinia uttered her need for independence one to many times. Being browbeaten as a reader with this idea nearly every chapter takes it's toll.With that huge venting aside the book was enjoyable. It is delightful to see Lavinia and Tobias' feelings deepen and mature as their partnership continues. I do look forward to the next book and hope that a balance can be found between independence and annoyance."
2,Quick to Avoid,"Don't Look Back was my first Amanda Quick novel. I am going to avoid this author from now on, due to the flat plot line and lackluster mystery. I can say, however, that I was intrigued with every character that was introduced in the book and because of this, I was pushed to finish reading it. I would like to see these characters in a more compelling storyline."
4,Nice Sequel to Shady Lady,"Amanda Quick fans should love this sequel to Shady Lady. It combines mystery, romance, and historical fiction genres."
3,I Miss the Old Amanda Quick,This was a delightful book and I enjoyed reading it however I miss the passion and sizzle of her earlier books. The characters are like old friends if you read the first book. Lavinia and Tobias are like a cat and a dog trapped in a bag when they are tying to solve this case but when the passion ignites between them you find yourself looking for a bed for them.The plot is very interesting and the villian believable. This book was enjoyable but I borrowed it from the library instead of purchasing it. I would purchase this book as a papperback but not hard back.
3,Don't Look Back,"I din't like these characters in the first book. Didn't need to see them in a second. Expected more from all her latest. They are not holding my interest as the earlier novels did. Will probably continue to purchase Krentz novels, but will not rush out as I used to."
2,not her usual development,"I've enjoyed many (if not all) of Amanda Quick's books - her female characters are always educated, intelligent and very capable for the time period her stories follow. Her male characters, who seem to admire women with these unusual feminine qualities - are themselves strong and supportive. This usually makes for a novel with not only romance, but intrigue, suspense and passion (excellent beach reading). The characters are too priggish and polite to eachother - even upon familiarity. Lavinia's character seems flat and peevish - her ""heat"" is not believable and for an intelligent woman - as written - seems stupidly unaware of the obvious - I'm not referring to her purposeful naivete. Tobias' character is more believable - he seems human, although he could use more depth. Hopefully the next one will be up to her usual par...."
2,No emotional depth; uninspiring,"My book club accidentally shipped me ""Don't Look Back."" As it looked mildly interesting and I hadn't read Amanda Quick before, I kept it. Then I realized I needed to read ""Slightly Shady"" first. So I bought it and was truly disappointed. The characters, what I could make of them (with little written about their physical characteristics), were uninspiring. There was little emotional depth to the story. You hardly ever saw what the characters are thinking or feeling. I just could not get to know or even like Lavinia or Tobias. I did read both books, and by the end of ""Don't Look Back"" I was mildly amused by the dialogue. So I give 2 stars for good dialogue and great plotting. That's all these two books have going for them."
1,Don't bother to look at all.,"This sequel to ""Slightly Shady"" is just as boring, if not worse, than the earlier title. The characters are cardboard cut-outs and the plot is laughable. After reading everything that AQ (aka JAK, etc) has written, I can safely say that if the next one is like this I, for one, am not going to bother again. I think this author needs to forget the contract pot-boilers and get back to basics."
3,Mesmerism and private investigation,"I have to start out by saying this was not my favorite of Amanda Quick's books. In this one it didn't seem to grab me and make me want to stop everything I was doing to be able to finish listening to it. I had figured out by the introduction of the character ""who did it"" that it was him and that it would take a long time to get to this in the story.In this story you learn of a widow who is also a mesmerist (hypnotist) who is not branching out into the line of ""private inquiries"" for those of the ton. I do admit that if the history or mesmerism dealing with the ""nerves"" was correctly portrayed in the story than it was rather interesting.But, if you have not listened to any of her other books it is a good introduction."
2,So So,"This book was interesting while reading it. I had read Slightly Shady before this one. I found Lavina not to be so much like herself in this one, yet to me she wasn't as annyoning as in the pass. I thought the background plot between Anthony and Emiline was great. However a day within reading this book I totally forget how it ended!!"
2,Disappointing,"When you start pondering that secondary characters would make better leads, you know that the story is in trouble. Lavinia Lake and Tobias March spend too much time arguing with each other and the mystery is rather weak. The two detectives team together to find an ancient Roman-British artifact that might have supernatural powers. Between arguments the two main characters attempt to find the artifact and solve a murder. As huge fan of Jayne Ann Krentz/Amanda Quick, I was very disappointed in this novel, to the point that I could put it down and not really want to get back to it."
4,The further adventures of Lavinia and Tobias,"The further adventures of Lavinia and Tobias (as started in Slightly Shady) ... Lavinia and Tobias, now lovers and business partners, are in search of a killer. Celeste, the wife of an old family friend of Lavnia's is murdered. To complicate matters, a priceless bracelet is also missing. Lavinia and Tobias figure that if they can find the bracelet, they will find the killer. Of course, they aren't the only ones searching for it. This was a charming, light read that made me chuckle. I especially like the lively interaction between Lavinia and Tobias."
1,don't look at picture,"This item is only the metals at the front, not the router. pictures are misleading"
2,Very disappointed,Cuco sings on only 3 tracks. We are fond of the music but bought the disc because it appeared to contain songs sung by him. We are still looking for recordings of Rancheras that are sung from the heart like Cuco does so well.
1,Size is off...Don't buy this product,These are the worst filters I have had ever laid my hands on. There are no labels or any words on these filters. They look like very cheap filters. I bought six and did not fit my intake vent and contacted seller but no success. Save yourself some money and frustration...Don't buy anything like this from this seller.
5,Satisfied,This product does what it's supposed to. Nothing fancy. Nothing bad. It just plain old works. I wish everything I bought online did that.
4,Very enjoyable,"I just discovered this cozy mystery series and I have and I think I'm going to like them very much. Our sleuth is a widow of nearly 3 years with 3 lovely children. Love the characters and the mystery(s) was engaging. I'd figured out what was going on with the 2nd mystery in the book, but not who the perpetrator was. Very nicely done.This book was apparently written in the mid-late 90's, but you wouldn't guess it - it's aged very well indeed, as a well-written mystery should."
4,Quick shipping & item in Excellent condition!,I was happy that the shipping time for this item happened quickly. It was promised to ship on 3/2/09 & I receieved the item on 3/9/09.
3,Advice for the storms of life,Max gives us in a very readable format advice and reassurance for our personal storms. I am using this book for a study group of Stephens ministers.
1,Not Helpful at All.,"I read this book hoping it would help me feel better. It did the opposite. It is, hands down, the worst ""Christian inspirational"" book I have read. If you are a die-hard Christian you will get something out of this book. I am a skeptic and everything I read in this book led me further and further away from believing in God. I was so disgusted with the weak analogies and circular logic that I actually threw this book across the room."
4,How to seek calm in chaos.,"Once again Max Lucado uses seemingly bland every day events - forgetting the alarm code, misplacing a contact lens, or just reaching out to family during long and strenuous trips - to communicate how God works in seemingly hopeless or hope draining situations. He divides the book into three different subjects of conversation (and reading Max Lucado feels very much like you are having a conversation with him) - Stress of Demands, Storms of Doubt, and Sting of Failure - offering up plenty of Scriptural backed up anecdotes on how to better understand God in action, even when he seems the most distant. Some examples touched on matters that are very important to me, others just seemed quaint and diverting, but little more. Fans of the preacher who writes or the writer that preaches will need no encouraging to give this book a look, others unfamiliar with him should give it a look as well. Recommended."
4,Another Good Read by Lucado,"Max Lucado continues his excellent authorship with ""In the Eye of the Storm"". In this title, Lucado takes one particular day in Jesus' life and how the day relates to the stresses and strains we face in life and how Jesus is there to help us during those storms.Consistent with his other books, each chapter (there are 28 of them) contains about 3-5 pages of a theme and Lucado wraps the theme around Jesus' life and how He can guide us through the storms.Read, enjoy, and be encouraged to know that you are not alone in your challenges! Highly recommended."
5,"When you're in the storm, read this","I read this while in the middle of a life-storm of epic proportions, and it helped me in ways I can't even express."
4,"Fun, light and filled with helpful stories of Faith","I always enjoy Max's books on Faith and the spiritual journey. This is not exception. He weaves his own family life, his own ups and downs into the New Testament that makes his thoughts easily relatable. This one is about the turbalent times in ones life and the importance of Faith. This too shall pass, if!"
3,Not right for my HP PC,I have an older HP Pavilion which uses PC133 memory. My HP would not recognize this memory at all. Tried alone and with my original stick of 256MB. I have returned this product. 3 stars because memory is probably fine with the right PC.
4,Robust and Fun,The toy is fairly sturdy as it is able to witstand the attention and experiments of an active five year old and continue to function. the only recommendation would be to get recahrable batteries.
4,great toy for boys,I sent this to my nephew for his 5th birthday...he loves it and was crying that I forgot to send batteries with it. It's was a great value.
1,I shouldn't have read it.....,Another self-serving book. We get behind the curtain of an egocentric athlete. All of that attitude for a religious man. I should have given it away. Only for the true T.O. fans.
1,Self-serving,"Hard to believe the reviews on this page where people take this guy at his word. So he's hard-working, so what? The guy is a jerk that cares about nothing unless it benefits him. He's great at saying all the right things when his back is against the wall. He claimed he was misunderstood and promised to be a team player and show his character at this Philly press conference. Now he says the same garbage in Dallas - again misunderstood, again says he knows what is expected of him and he won't let his team down.The only worse football teammate I can think of is Lucy from Peanuts - but at least she honored her contract."
5,Great behind the scenes look,"Whether or not you like Terrell Owens, he does a good job of taking the reader behind the scenes to show what happens on the field and in the locker-room. I personally find these things fascinating.The book is well organized, starting with T.O.'s childhood and going through his days as a 49er, and his excitement over becoming an Eagle.I would recommend this book to any serious sports fan."
2,Not for use with a dove tail jig,"I purchased a ""D"" handle PC 691 to use with the PC 24"" Omnijig. Because I have a small shop dust collection is a major objective. This dust collection system works, at best, marginally when using the Omnijig. The lower collection enclosure cannot be used. The side port collects minimal shavings. I still use the system and from time to time turn off the vacumm to gauge if it is worth the setup. Yes, it does collect some of the chips, but probably not worth the price if the dust collection system is exclusively used with an Omnijig application. The PC 691 is exclusively used for dove tail work in my shop. If I'm missing something here I'd welcome correction."
1,Collects what?,"Set up the collecter on a P C 690 with a 1/2 inch 2 flute straight cutting bit. Bit was out of the collecter base 7/8 inch. Hooked up a 6 gallon Sear's vaccuum and the collecter proceded to not work. It immediatly jamed with chips. I cleaned the collecter and rechecked my setup, it should work,but jammed immediatly. To be fare the collecter might work ok on things like MDF, Particle board or Masonite but dont try anything that makes any amount of chips. I havent tryed the edge routing attachment, but I cant see how it would work much better.Will R."
3,Sleeping with the Devil: How Washington Sold Our Soul for Saudi Crude,"The book is very factual, but the writing stile is rather boring. Interesting to people who are involved in that region."
2,"Unintelligible rambling, relies on the reader's fears","If this is the way folks in the CIA write reports, the US would be wise to shut the operation down. Stream of consciousness ramblings has never been a successful way to communicate and get things done.The book presents a simplistic, misleading, or fictional version of the reality. The silly blacked out lines will offend the reader. The author's personal agenda seems to be anger at his relative poverty. There is all this money floating around the Middle East and he isn't sharing in the fun.The hysterical rants about oil corruption are hardly new, and fail to shed any insights upon human nature, American or Saudi."
4,Must read,"After a couple chapters you may feel like you're reading a novel, instead of a real story about our Government and leaders from both sides of the isle. I can think of no matter more threatening to our security and standard of living. Were key portions of the Saudi Oil infrastructure destroyed, or the royal family overthrown - chaos and economic depression would almost certainly follow. All because our leaders are greedy fools, willing to put our future at risk to line their pockets.This isn't crazy left wing propaganda, I'm a lifelong Republican. This issue is nonpartisan, both parties are responsible for making us dependent on the Saudis. Just how dependent is frightening and shocking to say the least.Read it then act."
4,Sobering View of the Politics of Middle East Oil,"Baer provides a coherent and sobering picture of our dependence on Saudi oil, the political powderkeg in the Gulf region and the twisted maneuvers by which the U.S. tries to deal with it all. It is shocking, but he connects the dots well to make it all (unfortunately) quite believable. Along the way he paints a picture of a bureaucratic and politically paralyzed CIA that had no clue before Sept. 11th, as it was too risk averse to delve into the real world deeply.I strongly recommend also reading The Prize, by Daniel Yergin, which is a long but enthralling history of Oil and its role in shaping the modern economic and political realities. This book made it clear to me that Oil is a hidden subtext to many of the most inexplicable aspects of our foreign policy."
4,Saudi Arabia corruption,"This book is a CIA operatives perspective on the dangerousness our relationship with Saudi Arabia. Specifically how the Saudi royal family could buy and sell Washington with their vast sums of money. He also talks about how the significant radical Saudi population despises the rich and corrupt royal family. Very enlightening book, and Baer's conclusions for dealing with the issues are quite surprising."
4,Learn about Saudi Arabia,"Baer goes into great length about how the U.S. Govt (Repub and Dems alike) are in the pocket of the Saudi Royal family. The oil industry is big business and means big money and no one is immune to the greed. Not as shocking as actually scary, Baer paints the Saudi Royal family as a house of cards ready to tumble and if you read the news you can see this is the case, Baer only backs it up with the kind of insight that you can get from an ex-CIA action officer."
4,Depressing Reality,"This book by Robert Baer, the ex-CIA agent involved in the Syriana movie project w/George Cloony. The book is impassioned, and ultimately very depressing -- all the information in the book about Washington, Egypt & Saudi Arabia that we don't hear/see in the media has the ring of truth. And if the book is accurate, then Iraq and Lebanon are just the warm-up for bad stuff to come in the Middle East."
2,Well written but no research,"Although this book was well written and enthralling, I found that the author cited virtually no sources for any of his claims. Granted, the author is a former CIA agent but I'm sure that basic research could have backed up many of his salient points. However, without any other sources besides his own opinion, this book fails to make its point. We can't belive everything Mr. Baer says just be cause he says its true."
2,"Compelling subject, terrible writer","Despite the fascinating-- and deeply disturbing-- premise of this book, it is so poorly written as to be virtually unreadable. Mr. Baer substitutes innuendo, unsupported assertion, and conjecture for facts, evidence, and a cogent argument. He comes across as disgruntled and sophomoric. The U.S. - Saudi relationship is such a critical, and self-destructive, aspect of U.S. foreign policy-- it is a pity it isn't better explored here."
3,An author with an axe to grind,"One theme throughout this book is that the government has been blind to the many issues in the middle east that are readily evident to the author. While there may be a lot of truth to the arguments, the tone and one-sidedness make it difficult to trust.The key argument he presents is that there are a number of mutual addictions that promulgate a dangerous situation in the middle east. The US is addicted to oil. Saudi royals are addicted to their money and playboy culture. Saudi citizens are addicted to the extreme welfare state (and thus have more time to be susceptible to extremists. In a brief aside he mentions that the Saudi Royals may have learned how to act by the American petrobusinesses that 'taught' them. And based on the accounts in this book, Saudi Arabia does seem to be run very similarly to a big business (with little in common with a country.)The insights and accounts are quite appealing. The book itself, would benefit from a more balanced tone."
3,"More opinions than evidence, and still a good eye-opener","I liked ""See No Evil"" a lot better. I learned a lot from ""Sleeping with the Devil"", and encourage others to read it as well. Given the lack of evidence to back up some of his assertions, I would suggest getting this from a library, rather than buying it. Or get the paperback. While he gives the reader a LOT to think about, there's a lot more personal anger in this book, which made me wonder about his objectivity. It has a more superficial, hurriedly written feel to it, as if he just sat at a computer and vented, without much editing or background research. Still a valuable read."
3,Politically Incorrect ... Awesome,"I like people who are not politically correct, because I am not. I like to look my enemy in the eye and tell him what I think. Baer definitely has no problem confronting the Saudis and even the US administration when it does something he thinks it should not do.I learned a lot of things about Saudi, oil, weapons trade, and radical Islam from this book."
3,"Generally Good Work, with Issues","Bob Baer's latest is just like last book. A generally good book, showing good command over the material. However, as usual, Baer's bitterness towards Business-As-Usual Beltway Politics shows through. He would do well to calm his anger towards those who ended his CIA career and focus on the issues at hand."
3,Important but not riveting,"A scathing indictment of every presidential adminstration's self-delusions about the most decadent and corrupt regime in the world. But: it seems poorly organized, unfocused, and fixated with minor players."
4,riveting work by former CIA agent - basis for film Syriana,Compelling work with a lot of details by former CIA agent of how the U.S. government has made a deliberate decision to not understand groups such as the Muslim brotherhood (a major precursor to Al Queda) despite a long history in which these groups commit suicide and murder to achieve their objectives.
4,Compelling and Informative Read,"A lot of disparging things ave been said about former CIA agent Robert Baer in the years following the collapse of the twin towers. That said, this book provides very informative background on Saudi Arabia and its importance to our economy as well as the principal actors within the kingdom. Others have said and I agree that the book is choppy in parts, depends on minor actors and its deletions are the author's attempts to make the book appear more than it is. That said, it is a great book about a fascinating part of the world we are all starting to learn about for the first time."
4,"Very Good Book, But Needs References","Robert Baer's book is very good. The basic premise, that the Saudi Government is supporting global Islamic terrorist activities in order to divert the attention of fundamentalist groups from its own corruption, is supported by a number of other books and articles on the subject. However, Baer fails to cite a single reference backing up any of his statements. I would have been very skeptical of his book if I hadn't read similar, supported, accounts in the past. A writer with Baer's credentials, a former CIA operative who should be fully credible, deflates his arguments by not citing a single reference. Perhaps much of the reference material is classified, but certainly enough evidence exists in the public press for him to have cited numerous sources.This is a worthwhile read, but it will require further homework by the reader in order to provide the missing links."
4,THEMEN 1-2,For me that i'm beginnig to lern German it's very important to have a goog material for improoving my listening skils. Themen 1-2 Cd's will give to you these oportunitie. All the situations are very funny and are the ones that use in the day by day living. If you are learning German and if you are using the Themen 1&2 Course books you MUST have these Cd's. If you are not using Themen 1&2 cours books it doesen't mathers.Cd's will be very usefull to you.
5,"its a flap disc, nuff said",Grit discs are pretty awesome for removing rust and taking off bits of paint without unduly destroying the underlying surface like you would with a grinding disc.
2,cheap and poorly made,"Bought this fan from Amazon which was delivered yesterday. Our AC broke down, so I was eagerly waiting for this fan. I chose this model as I live in a small condo, and space is limited. I am thoroughly disappointed!!!! The fan is made with cheap plastic, particularly the parts that I had to assemble. One of the notches on the base where the wire should be inserted broke, and as hard as I tried I could not get two screws to fit properly due to poor alignment. Somehow got the unit assembled and turned it on. The fan is quiet, but if you are more than four feet away, you do not feel the breeze. Since the base and the tubes holding the fan are not properly screwed, the fan is wobbly too!! I will NOT recommend this fan to anyone. I wish I had bought a Vornado instead :("
2,Lasko 2530 - Faulty remote on two towers in a row. Be careful.,"I bought a second Lasko 2530 tower when the remote on the first one didn't work. The remote on the second didn't work either. It is a major hazzle to repack these fans in their boxes and haul them to the post office for shipping. I emailed Lasko to find a solution but no help was available. Fortunately, because I bought from Amazon I will be reimbursed for shipping, which is not true of other vendors. Be careful. PS.. I like the volume of air and quietness of the unit enough to go for the 42"" model, only from Amazon, in case I need to return it."
4,Good Buy.,"Never had a tower fan before, but this was a treat to buy for the summer. The first one arrived damaged from shipping and the manufacturer stated that it is unusual for that to happen during shipping. Got my replacement in four days in great shape.The fan is quiet for the most part, but can make a clicking noise when you first start it but quickly goes away. No noise on oscillation. Stirs the air enough to feel it across the room even on a low setting. This is great for an apartment, dorm or office.Does not come with the 2 AAA batteries needed for the remote, but my apartment is small enough for me to easily walk over to it so I don't mind."
3,"nice fan, slight clicking noise has started","Nice looking fan; great height/size. Worked perfectly (very quiet, cools large room) for several weeks, but has just recently started a faint clicking noise."
1,Poor Quality,This fan worked for about a week and then stopped working. Keep in mind it stopped working when I needed it the most so it was a bit frustrating.The return process was a bit of a mess too because there is some assembly required for this fan and I didn't keep the original box like I normally do.I would not recommend this product.
5,Lasko 2530 Wind Tower fan review,"Both fans work perfectly. Extremely quiet and very efficient. I am able to keep my AC on 78 degrees (in Florida), and am very comfortable. My electric bill has dropped 20%."
2,Disappointed,We had the model before this one and until it died YEARS later we never had a problem and the fan was quiet. Now with in less than a week this new fan is making noises and we have already discarded packaging.
3,Not powerful enough,"Although this is a beautiful fan to look at, it doesn't seem to have enough oomph to cool the room. I would recommend this fan for people who have A/C and need to move the air a bit..."
5,Great Fan,The product arrived quickly! I am very pleased how quite the fan is and the remote is very handy. It takes up very little room and circulates the air both high and low.
1,Good While it Lasts...,"I received a model just like this as a gift last summer and it worked great. However, one day towards the end of summer it totally died on me. I didn't have a receipt to return it to the store, so I contacted Lasko. All they could do is tell me to blow into the fan with canned air to clean it out. It didn't work and I was out of luck because I didn't have a receipt. They would not honor the one-year warranty without a receipt, even though I'm sure they could determine the date it was made via the serial number. If you buy this, definitely hang on to your receipt."
1,This Fan totally Sucks Don't get one!!!,I tried this fan for not a week and it completely stopped working period!!I tried a replacement and the same thing happened in just one day of operation!!!!Go get something else not by this manufacuture Lasko!
1,poorly manufactured,"This product is kind of very poorly made.There are a row of scratches and dents on top of the panel when I open the box.The plastic grills have several pieces of burrs.After assembling it, I even want to return it immediately.but since it functions well right now, I would keep it.I do not recommend it if you are looking for fans around this price range."
1,DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY,"The company did not even notify me that there was an error on their system. I had to follow up to figure out that my product was ""STUCK"" in their system and has not even shipped it. The shipment was a month late.I HIGHLY advise to stay away from purchasing anything from this company. They have sense of customer service."
5,better than the old fan,"I love this tower fan, it's quiet and I love the sleep setting. My old fan was loud and creaked when it moved, this one can go on for a sleep cycle of 6.5 hours and then turns off by itself, that way I don't wake up in the wee hours of the morning cold from the fan."
2,lasted one season,"worked great for a couple of months, then the whole thing died. I tried taking it apart to look for loose connections, didn't see any. Getting it fixed is the price of another fan..."
2,Nice while it lasted...,"As with the reviewer above, I purchased this fan from another store and it worked well at first. The remote was a nice touch and the fan speeds and settings worked well. However within 4 months of owning it, when we tried to have it rotate, it turns slightly, gets stuck, and proceeds to just make a clicking sound until you stop it from rotating. Needless to say it no longer rotates, so it is now just a stationary fan. I even tried taking it apart to unjam it, but came to discover that the rotating gear was already worn down and that was the problem, so without new parts it could not be fixed. Buy another fan if you want it to last, I know I am."
4,dorm lovely,"I bought this item for my dorm room. So far I haven't been able to use it there for school doesnt start back for another 20 days but for the last month it has been a nice addition to my bed room at home. I run it every day and so far it hasnt let me down. For a girl it was a new experience to assemble the stand, but I got it done. I was surprised at how easy the assembling was!"
1,fans damaged,"I bought 9 fans, and I am very sorry but I think you searched for fans old and damaged, because they left me 5 damaged fans, it is a difficult situation because more than half of the fans came out damaged and not the s could return because the cost was much higher for me, I had to vote for them because they didn't is that I lost my money"
2,Works well for a little while...,"I bought this and spent the extra $30 over the cheaper tower fans thinking my price premium would buy me a longer life out of the fan. Turns out i was wrong. I had the same oscillating/clicking issue after just a month of use. now the oscillating gear is done and it either makes loud creaks & noises on oscillate, or it is stationary. At least it still works though!it isn't as quiet as i'd expect either. Having seen some friends' fans from Crane & Honeywell, i know this could be quieter. Lasko isn't one of the better brands, there is just so many more of them out there..."
2,Lasko 2530 - Faulty remote on two towers in a row. Be careful.,"I bought a second Lasko 2530 tower when the remote on the first one didn't work. The remote on the second didn't work either. It is a major hassle to repack these fans in their boxes and haul them to the post office for shipping. I emailed Lasko to find a solution but no help was available. Fortunately, because I bought from Amazon I will be reimbursed for shipping, which is not true of other vendors. Be careful. PS.. I like the volume of air and quietness of the unit enough to go for the 42"" model, only from Amazon, in case I need to return it. I posted these remarks under a seperate offering for this fan but it doesn't show up here, until I repost it.... I guess we have to look at every product offered to get all the feedback on the article we are interested in?"
2,Works well but not for long,"I had this fan a few years back. It worked well for atleast a year. Ultimately I got rid of it b/c I was moving and the oscillating became steadily more noisy. I tried to see if anything was catching in the motor, nothing was. I used WD40 to lubricate it....didn't work. I wouldn't recommend this one as a long term solution to air circulation."
4,COOLS AND QUITE TOO,The Lasko Tower Fan was easy to install.It cools me on hot muggy weather not to mention it does not take much space in a small room.You won't be wasting your money with this fan!
4,A Fan of the Fan,For the money this fan seems good...have had it 1 month now and seems ok...good air movement and quiet for the most part. I had an Aloha but the osilator gave out after 10 months so we will see how this one lasts.
2,Lasko Tower Fan,"This fan doesn't work on the highest setting. Very disappointing. It's to cumbersome to return, so I live with it on the middle setting. :-("
3,what happened?,"this came fast, packaged very well. plant looked great and healthy. was very happy with this purchase, but after a few weeks, it's slowly dying! i didn't repot it, since it had been shipped and been through a lot that week. so i just hung it where it gets plenty of indirect sunlight. watering moderately as they don't like too much moisture... i've had these in the past and usually easy to take care of. not sure what happened... sad :("
1,Not like the picture.,"I was disappointed in the appearance of the 2 string of pearls I purchased. They were not fully developed, we're overwatered, soggy, and damaged. I will be returning them for a refund."
2,Not too happy,Plant has never thrived and I think it is close to dying at this point. Very small even within the very small pot.
2,No where like picture,Plant was well packaged but was nowhere close to what the picture diplayed online. Definitely not worth what I payed for it. Its a hanging pot that did not even have an attached saucer to catch the water. Live & learnAmira
2,Disappointed,"Sorry to say that I was quite disappointed with my purchase of the String of Pearls 6"" Hanging Basket from Hirt Gardens. The plant was not as full as pictured and several ""strings"" fell off during unpacking and once hung. Giving it TLC and hoping for the best; the price was a bit high for what I received, I would have been quite happy had it arrived as pictured."
2,the pot does not drain,The plant arrived perfect and healthy. It filled the pot full of green I could not see or feel the soil. The pot looks like it has a bottom lip that drains. I watered the plant expecting it to drain. It does not. Now my plant is dead. I am very disappointed.
4,Deightful new houseplant.,"This plant looked really good when it came, but now it's not so sure. I'm probably doing something wrong. The plant was well-packed and thriving the day it came. I was tickled pink with it."
2,PLANTS DIE,"why do my string of pearl plants never live long. i have purchased several- and they don't live. what am I doing wrong? i love the plantsthey seem healthy, but are doomed with my ""care"". please check with HIRTS thank you"
1,Don't reccommend seller,"I was dissapointed with this product! When the plant arrived the best thing about it was the packaging. It looks nothing like the photo, it had only a few strings on it. The soil was mouldy and the plant was infested with fungus gnats.The plant was a Christmas present, it is already dying from the base out. I will NOT be buying from this seller again!!"
5,The mesmerizing allure of the desert captured in music,"If the desert were a siren, these would be her songs. This album -- dedicated to Edward Abbey -- succeeds in capturing the essence of the American desert southwest like few other recordings can. This is a very subtle and silent album that can only be fully appreciated with headphones. The sonic and musical textures evoke the expansive, solitary, peaceful and forboding atmosphere of the desert. Even the ghosts of the native southwest (Hopi, Navajo, Anasazi) come to life on a couple tracks. Anyone with an appreciation for the desert southwest will be enchanted and haunted by these pieces."
5,"Sad, Serene, Beautiful.","There isn't much else to say except Desert Solitaire is exceptionally stand out and brilliant. It is among my favorites, if not the favorite of my electronic ambient collection. In particular Labyrinth is one of the most beautifully sad pieces I've ever heard. It reminds how therapeutic to the soul solitude and solitary contemplation can be."
4,An Ansel Adams companion soundtrack to the American SW!!,"If somone wanted to get a sense of what the American desert southwest wa slike should listen to this disk. I can feel the heat of the desert in ""Highnoon"" or the awesome spectical of a large rock foundation in ""Spectre"". even the opening sequence of ""Flatlands"" conveys a hint of what is to come. After Dreamtime Return"", this is the next definite addition to a New Age collection."
3,80's Flicks That R Classic With A Twist..,"Give this movie a chance not to be taken serious. But has moments we may all go thru, Yet there is comedy, seriousness, & personal redemption. Remember the 80's had the movies that even today there trying to emulate. Think of Harbodies, Fast Times Richmond High, Porky's, Last American Virgin, give this one a view."
4,easy to watch as it seems we all want to get rich quick..,"i had a good time watching this movie as it was a nice and easy story to follow along with very nice looking woman. as long as you don,t expect a classic this movie holds it,s own and has a message for all of us.."
4,Buen Disco De Navidad,"Buen Disco De Navidad. Tiene temas alegres y uno triste, ""Si Papa Se Quitara"" Tremendo trabajo musical que contribuyo Yomo Toro como siempre."
4,Not so non-technical,This book has some good information but I found it to be more technical than I preferred.
4,Good series for a differant sort of entertainment,"I bought this season of top shot mostly because I knew the guy that won that year, but the wide veriety of weapons and challenges they came up with for them was very interesting. The interesting thing to me was that none of the ""professionals"" performed as well as the bunch of back woods nutsI spent most of my life hanging out with do in simalar situations. Get a bunch of back woods red necks bored and give them an abundance of weapons and ammo and we challenge ourselve in much the same way with out the vote offs and big money prize, but just to see what we can do. Recon thats whythe counrty boy that runs a christain youth camp for a living won, He had nothing to prove he was just having fun. GRIZZ"
3,"Not bad, not great","A little disappointed, thought it would be better with some of the names on here. It was ok, some very parts but also some dead parts too."
3,Worthwhile,"DL does a pretty good job as host and the line-up of comedians is satisfactory. This is probably worth watching, but it won't split your sides too often."
2,Not that good.,"""Chasing Shadows"" is a good song, with some great drumming by Ian Paice. But the ablum as a whole really does not follow suite. The over-long ""April"" is one of the worst things this band has done. ""Blind"" is not bad, but then again it follows ""Chasing Shadows"" and therefore just does not stack up. Early Deep Purple is best represented on ""Shades Of Deep Purple."" This album is basically for compleatist only."
5,Best Rock Album of ALL TIME,"Now come on. We all know this is the greatest DP lineup.From the strange Chasing Shadows beat to the orchestral beauty of April, this Disc has got it all going on. Every tune is a total experience in the way only DP AND rICHIE bLACKMOORE can do. Blows away everything during this era of R&R.;Any questions??? Buy this CD NOW!!!!!!"
5,Deep Purple (the 3rd album),"In my opionion the best Deep Purple album ever made.From the opening sounds of Ian Paice hammering the drums to the beautifully orchastrated April,this CD kicks. This line-up known as Mark 1 with Rod Evans on vocals,and Nick Simpler on bass,peaked with this outting.This remastered version really brings out the music.Just listen to Lords organ on Lalena and April,or Simplers bass lines throughout.Blackmores guitar playing with the occasional wah-wah cutting through the speackers.Rod Evans(arguable the best singer that Purple ever had)really shines. The bonus tracks are good,especially the keyboard in Lalena,and Ritchie's picking in The Painter.But it is the original 8 songs that bring back great memories from yesteryear.Give it a listen and you will know what I mean."
2,resuse spray,I really didn't feel this product helped as much as the drops under the tonque and I didn't like the taste. Where the drops are tasteless.
3,iLive dock station,"This dock station is decent. For the money it cost, it's worth it!It's perfect for a work cubical situation & it charges you ipod too."
4,good for under $40,"So there isn't any bass, it's a nice charger dock with remote for under $40. It looks like good and even makes a decent night-light."
1,Horrible.,"This may look cool but its very cheap and not worth 30 bucks.. I had it for not even a year and i did not use it much and then it broke. First it stoped charging which i used all the time, then later the sound stopped working. The metal peice that hooks to ur ipod some how broke but it looked fine and the sound stoped. So now if i want to use it i put a push tak behind the ipod to hold it forward and if im lucky the sound will work but wont be clear and scratchy. Well untill it falls off. Not only that but the volume and the speakers were horrible and quiet. Then to make it worse the remote which i used the most quit working not because of a battery but all of the buttons becides the skip forward broke and would not work. So if i wanted to pause or go back or turn the volume up, i would have to do it on the ipod which then it would come off of the metal peice and stop working. Do not buy this item, u can buy something cheaper that is much better."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!,"I would advise you to keep shopping and do not buy this item. It was cheap from the get go, volume very low and of very poor quality. I have owned this since September of 2007 and now even when its not in use the speakers start to pop loudly. Save your money."
1,Total Junk - Do NOT purchase,"This product actually worked okay for a few months, but the quality was poor. We encountered the exact same issues as everyone else. The volume controls broke first, followed by the power button, then total static. I'm pretty good at fixing electronics but when I took this item apart, it was total JUNK. Do not waste your money. Also, the remote is made of plastic & paper - bad!"
2,Not what I wanted,"One of the reasons I wanted an iPod dock was to hook it up to my house sound system and still be able to control the songs with the remote. What I didn't find out until later was that this particular dock doesn't have an ""audio out"" plug. I just assumed that it would be a standard jack for all docks. Perhaps I should have done my research a little bit more, but I just went with whatever was the best seller figuring that would be fine."
1,Broke after one night,"Volume control stopped working the morning after we unpacked it. Now it works only on high, with lots of static. I wasn't expecting much sound quality at this price point, but this product is ridiculously shoddy."
2,Volume control,"The same thing happened to me as it did other people, right when I took it out of the box, the volume buttons wouldn't work. It was stuck on a really loud volume and wouldn't go down no matter what. I'm going to have to take it back, and I probably won't get it again, I'll get something else."
1,Didn't work for us,"Bought this as a Christmas gift for my 16 year old daughter so she could listen to her IPod via the speakers. It looks great, but she was unable to raise/lower the volume either by the remote or by using the controls directly on the speaker unit itself. When the IPod was placed in the docking station it came out so low that she could hardly hear it. Nothing she did could adjust the audio level.Just in case there was an issue with her IPod we had a friend of hers bring her IPod over and the results were the same.The best part of this item was Amazon's return policy. No hassle or fuss and she's looking at another system to use her IPod with."
4,Perfect for my Garage,This little dock and speaker system for the Ipod has respectable fidelity and a usable remote control.Just what I was looking for to keep in the Garage.
4,Great iPod Dock wth good sound,"This iPod dock is great for a small room but is not as good for a bigger part type atmosphere. I am not sure why in other reviews people complain about the remote, but I found the remote very accessible and user friendly. The only thing this iDock can not do is play videos from the iPod, but even still the music is great for a small room. Finally the price is a bargain for the features."
1,Not a good product,The speaker quality is very poor and will occasionally make a humming sound when playing music. The volume control does not always work
2,not my favorite piece,"I bought this item as a present, the first item I bought on Amazon and I wish I had read the reviews. The bass is awful. I know I should have realized for the price it would be a bad quality, but I'm learning! I definitely would not reccommend this item to anyone. Just go to a store and get one you can really check out!!!!"
3,"It's okay, but...","I was disappointed that the remote is not full-function, but other than that it works fine."
2,low quality glossy,papers are low quality glossy and can be easily bent. Buy the high quality glossy paper separately if you're looking for better quality papers
2,Plotless Series of Character Sketches Make the Work a Bore,"This is not a book for everyone. I received this book as a gift from a relative, and that's the main reason I thought I'd try it. The book is a portrayal of E.E. Cummings' imprisonment in France during WWI, and the bulk of the work is a portrayal of the many characters Cummings saw at the prison -- and the many cruelties they suffered at the hands of their keepers and each other. While Cummings' prose is casual, ironic, and sometimes amusing, the work as a whole suffers from a lack of a plot to drive it forward. I frequently grew tired of reading one elaborate character sketch after another. Other people obviously are forgiving of this fault because they enjoy Cummings' prose so much, but I couldn't bear it."
3,A different style,"Ram Herrera looks different on this CD's pictures -- he's grown a goatee and is dressed like a salsa star. Musically, too, the music is more pop than what he's done in the past. It's still good, but I miss the more polka/traditional stuff he used to do. And he should get back in to the cowboy clothes!"
3,Meh...,"I don't think it great, it's sort of wobbly and cheap, but it is cute:) if I had paid half, I would have been happy"
2,Holes not well design,"The holes are not well design, I could not get one of the tubes into the holes, it doesnt looks good!"
1,Very disappointed,"I order this coat rack for my bathroom to hang towels, night clothes and such, so I would not have to put up big towel bars or hooks on the doors. The first one I ordered came without the ends of the poles being grooved in order to screw into the next one. I sent it back and Amazon immediately sent me a replacement. That one, the ""peg"" that fit into the holes into the poles were larger than the holes they are suppose to slide into. My husband and I had to do a lot of work to get this rack together, and had to make numerous mechanical adjustments. I'll never buy from this manufacturer again. It's not worth the money nor the aggravation."
3,Not as advertised but settled with seller,"This product was not in the condition in which it was listed. However, I contacted the seller and was issued a partial credit."
1,waste of time and money,"This entire book is just one long, drawn out sales pitch. Very few actual techniques are discussed or explained. I found the commentary to be extremely judgemental to the point of being arrogant."
1,sucks,Not at all what I expected. A whole bunch of talking about trying to convince your mind to open your hips and what not. It was annoying to listen to.
4,Good Enough,"This is a moderately priced router attachment. It's easy to attach and relatively easy to adjust. The adjustment is fine enough for most work on flat surfaces that fully support the router base.If your trying to route something like the front end of a cabinet (thin, isn't wide enough to support the router base) the method you use is to extend the guide is to screw a piece of wood to the adjustable plate. This plate can be thrown off because the guide plate shifts up and down because it doesn't meet the base of the router. I solved this by attaching a piece of plywood for a guide and making sure it was fully up against the router base otherwise the fence can shift.I've had the more expensive magic circle router jig (I can't remember the exact name) and it did more things that I never used. It dropped it. It broke and I looked for something else, less expensive. This jig is reasonably priced and does the job."
4,OVER BUILT,"Granted this thing is accurate and well made (almost bomb proof) but why so heavy and bulky.I dont think it's necessary.I love porter cable products and have used them for years.My edge guide came as a freebie with a package deal I bought.I use it and have no complaints about it other than it being just too big and heavy.If and When I buy a new edge guide it will be the porter cable model# 5043,it offers the same level of accuracy but without all the bulk. Now get out there and round something over."
1,Major flaw somewhere,"This is one of the best guides I have owned. Perhaps its unfair giving this low a rating; but, I would never use it without the router it fits on. I do a lot of normal and advanced router work. When I saw this jig and envisioned easy adjustments I ordered it right away.I never use it.I have several Porter-Cable routers that this guide will fit. The problem is that it mounts with the handles in the wrong orientation to the way you work. It is the routers problem.With the guide mounted on the router the handle orientation is wrong (at least to my way of working). I have other routers and guides which present the handles in the way I usually hold them while working. I think Proter-Cable made a major design flaw which they never addressed. Beware."
5,Edge guide for P-C router,I've used this edge quide for several projects. It's solid and adjusts smoothly. With the edge guide I had for my previous router was hard to adjust especially in small increments. This P-C edge guide adjusts smoothly with a center knob. Two knobs on the side secure the fence once it is adjusted.
2,"looks good, mounts terrible","This edge guide works for those that like little pieces falling out of it and I wish I had never bought it. There are two small stainless spring clips that sandwich between the set screws and the straight edge arm. They fall out. Mounting to the 690 router base is a pain. It slides in the two holes but good luck tightening it and having it mounted tight with stability. Adding this straight edge makes the router awkward, out of balance, and heavy. There are other and better routers and straight edge kits out there...and it has forced me to purchase another brand with straight edge attachment. Sorry. Tom"
4,edge guide,this router edge guide is solid. its built well and works well as long as you move the router slowly so it doesn't jump off of the wood you are cutting.I would recommend it for your porter cable router.
2,PG 42690 Edge Gude,Nice Product but it does not fit my Porter-Cable Model 8529 type 1 router.The edge block does not have the tapped holes in the correct location for the 8529 router
4,Pain killer !!,"One of the best DM singles, no doubt. This perfect combination between melody and lyrics makes your mind fly away... That's it !"
2,a wierd and silly horror movie if you ask me!,"Movie starts off pretty well given the low budget of the film. Looks like it was filmed by some college students. After the first 25-30 minutes the movie starts getting really dull! The friends sit around a campfire telling about the scariest things that have ever happened to them. One of the girls starts rambling on about how some guy had broke into her apartment and tried to rape her. She says how she started to tell the guy to do it to her good, she said this freaked the guy out and he tried to run off. So then she runs after him naked and screaming at him don't you want me, you sick bleep! The bad language really flies while she is rambling on with this absurd story. Although there are some OK creepy scenes, the death scenes are totally confusing and wierd! Not a good movie in my opinion!"
1,pull through sharpner,"Pull through sharpeners do not work their a gimmick you see the angle of the bevel that makes the edge varies from steel to steel the only way to sharpen a knife or anything else for that matter properly is to do it by hand or buy a machine that will run you close to 1000$s the ""edge"" that these sharpeners leave while it may feel sharp to the touch it's whats called a false edge do yourself a real favor skip this and get a DMT sharpener I make knives and handle all sorts of sharps on a daily basis this item is a edge destruction machine"
5,Mental Illness,"The movie is an interview with Dr. Kay Redfield Jamison, she talks about her personal and professional experience with Bipolar (Manic Depression) disorder. She is a Professor of Psychiatry at John Hopkins Unversity. Her own experiences with depression and suicide help make the movie more real and personal. A good movie to understand what Bipolar is, the causes, treatments, and potential for recovery."
4,Ambient,An ambient dream sound scape that captures the feeling and majesty of the Himalayas.Played on Sirius radio #173 late nights.
5,5 stars on all counts,"though i would have to say, his PARIKRAMA deserves 11 stars....his work is simply outstanding and highly recommended"
4,Great Remixes but only 50% of the single,"These are great remixes, but I see no point in buying this when you can get the FULL SINGLE (In Your Room pt.1) with bonus live trax and 2 of the most IMPORTANT remixes of IN YOUR ROOM ever made. (See my review in IN YOUR ROOM pt.1 single) If you really are set on this however, you can't go wrong. The Apex mix is absolutely awesome, assuming you like AMBIENT music. The Jeep Rock Mix was MADE FOR BLASTING OUT YOUR CAR on a nice drive, and the Higher Love remix is very well done."
3,A nice overview of a good comic strip.,Summer 2004 Reading List - Mini ReviewThe Dick Tracy Casebook takes 7 adventures (one from each decade 1930's through 1980's and one more form the fifities) of Dick Tracy comic strips. Max Collins and Dick Locher were writing and drawing the strip at the time this book came out in 1990. Each adventure comes with a well written forward by the editors that gives excellent insights into Dick Tracy over the years and especially to his creator Chester Gould.
2,Disappointing Adoption,"The early chapters on human evolution are brilliant. Then comes a 60 page chapter on Agriculture which offers a catalogue of early sites and only alludes to Abu Hureya and the younger Dryas. The chapters on Mesoamerica and Peru are awfully sketchy. How do you manage a chapter on Peru without mentioning mit'a labor, split inheritance, or royal mummies? Don't be in any hurry to adopt this book."
4,Great vendor,The book was shipped exactly as described and was shipped promptly. The contents of the book are a joke but if it is a required text for a course this vendor will take care of you.
4,Almost perfect,"First of all, if you are even mildly interested in Archaeology, this is the book for you. I am majoring in the subject, and found this book to be extremely informative, and above all, entertaining and easy to read. I have only one complaint, and that is the lack of important word definitions on the actual page. Vocabulary is done in bold, however the text requires you to flip to the back of the book and look the word up in the glossary. This can get somewhat annoying when you are reading for long periods of time, as it can break up the flow."
3,It's okay!,"I am a fan of both Michael Cain and Michael Keaton (never been a better Batman), but this isn't one of their better works. I'm not a movie critic by along shot so you won't get any of the tech-language here, just an honest like or dislike opinion."
2,Hmmm,"The movie itself? Not so good. Its a pretty predictable thriller that tends to drag itself on an on. While I will admit there are some interesting scenes, the movie really doesn't pick up until the very end when the music kicks in for the credits. Its just so haunting. Unfortunatly, I cannot say the same for the rest of the movie. To make a long story short, my opinion is if you do happen to decide to pick this movie up, don't expect greatness. Although Michael Keaton and Cane aren't bad in and of themselves, the rest of the movie is pure...well I leave the rest of the sentance up to you to decide."
3,Quicksand DVD,"I watched this movie once and then placed it among those DVDs, which I probably will never watch again. The enhanced 1.85:1 picture is very good and has contributed to my three-star rating."
4,Neat Flick!!,"It seems that not alot of people have watched this little gem of a film, by the number of reviews that it has...but I have to say, that with the likes of Michael Keaton and Michael Caine, this film delivered a great action movie!!! The script was in a nice tight package, and the actors took the parts well. It was one of those films that made me wonder what was going to happen next.Christopher Berry"
5,Nice Change Of Pace For Two Great Stars!,"Thoroughly enjoyable film, great soundtrack, locations and story.Miichael Keaton is well-cast as a mild-mannered excecutive whose life is sent into turmoil when he goes to investigate shady deals being made through his company. Michael Caine as always is superb and really has fun with his role as Movie Star Jake Mellows. The supporting cast is great and the plot is well written.Note: Watch the featurette after you see the film."
1,Plot Holes Galore,"Five stars for Michael Keaton (I could watch that man read the PHONE book). The movie however, STUNK.There are sooo many plot holes and oddities in this movie (the girl lying ""dead"" in bed is blinking, no blood on the white sheets even though she's massacred), Keaton's character is somehow easily able to go from area to area without any transportation. He's able to send email without logging into any email service. It takes him 5 minutes to padlock a woman in a caged room and then is able to get her out of there in 2 seconds (and HOW did he get the key?). The whole movie is like that -- where you watch it and go, ""WAIT a minute. You can't DO that!"""
2,Not as good as I'd hoped..,"I really wanted to enjoy this crime thriller because it starred two of my favorite actors, Michael Keaton and Michael Kaine, but as much as I tried to be objective, this one didn't shine for me. The story never came together well because the directing and editing was simply awful. Even the star power of Keaton and Kaine couldn't overcome the lousy directing. The scenes were chopped and stapled together with impunity.This film had the potential to be a success. It had a reasonably well written script and the right actors to play the parts. It's a shame it didn't turn out that way. I own the DVD, but it's one I won't be watching again any time soon."
5,Good one,"It's a fine book for the people who are beginners in Mongolian history field. Recommended. Only thing that's missing on Mongols' subject in Osprey books is that they don't have anything from original Mongolian sources (Osprey books use either Chinese, Russian, or Arabic sources mostly)! But as I said before this book is good for beginners and you won't be dissatisfied."
2,Terrible product,I gave this accessory 2 stars because of the following:1. The plastic base made black marks on my work pieces that I had to sand off after using the router. The factory base works fine.2. The base was so rough that the router would not slide on the surface of the wood (oak). This caused the router to chatter and cut unevenly.3. It only picked up about 75% of the chips. I still had to sweep after completing the project.I received this as a gift last Christmas. I don't expect to use it again.
5,A Must-Read for MR Professionals,"Mental Retardation: Nature, Cause and Management is an easy-to-read review of the many issues and concerns related to mental retardation. Educators, mental health providers, residential program staff, health care providers, administrators, policy-makers, and students are offered a wealth of information related to avariety of topics, including: etiology, impact of MR on individual psychosocial functioning and personality, history and nature of support services for persons with MR, MR & sexuality, and dual diagnosis.Baroff summarizes the relevant research from a variety of disciplines ranging from the genetics and biology to linguistics, psychology, and education. He also provides detailed descriptions of common services, programs, and practical dilemmas encountered by persons with MR and the people who care for them. The 50-page bibliography is, in itself, an important resource."
4,a big surprise yabba dabba do,"After reading so many negative things I almost did not buy, I am glad I did.for those who do not know its a prequel to the the first first film, but it shows how Fred, and Wilma, Barney and Betty first met, very cleaver ideas. Fred would be younger so he looks younger then what we see in the cartoon or first film, but they play play the parts as you would think they would,My only gripe was Kazoo. They really did not need to add him in, he did nothing to film to carry the story or make it better. Besides Kazoo came long after they all met. That's why its 4 stars, not 5If you enjoyed the Flintstones as a kid, your love all over again. Rent the film for yourself. Then you can think for yourself if it is worth seeing.What so cool too is it truly is for both kids and adults. Not many films like that anymore."
3,Entertaining,"I hated the first movie, but thought this one was mindlessly humorous. And Dino definitely steals the show!"
3,Fun for the family,This is a good video for the whole family. My 4 and 6 year old children liked the video and it was enjoyable as an adult to view. The classic Flinstone moves are nostalgic.
5,"G.C.V. Great,Cool,Vegas","This movie is one of the funniest I've ever seen.The first time I saw it I laughed so hard my side hurt for hours.The casting was great,Barney and Betty sound like the real cartoon characters. The special effects for Dino make him look like a real dinosaur.I don't get why people think it's so boring,it's hysterically funny.If I directed the movie I wouldn't change a thing.I think this movie is the best.If you haven't seen the movie you have no idea what you've mist."
2,Quartet Wood Music Staff Liner 6x8,I also was unable to get the chalk to stay in the prongs. I plan on using pliers as one other customer to see if that will hold them in. I purchased Prang dustless chalk which is too small for the prongs.
2,Don't like it,The chalk will not stay in place. Falls out every time Attempt to draw lines on chalkboard. Waste of money.
2,Music Staff Liner,"On the plus side this product has a descent hand grip and it is light weight. On the downside, the chalk doesn't stay well positioned in the sockets. Unless you are always using brand new chalk sticks the chalk has a tendency to wobble and fall out. This tends to happen even if the chalk stick is only slightly used."
2,"Great idea, not practical","I have fond memories of using these back in the 1980's. This doesn't seem to hold the chalk pieces at all. They fall out or through, perhaps they are thinner than ""normal"" chalk. I'm not sure, I have also tried pinching the metal closed around them and it hasn't helped either. Disappointed..."
5,Great product,"Since I am left handed when I write on the chalkboard my writing goes up or down, but not anymore with this music staff liner. I use this to make lines for me so I can write on the chalkboard. I am very happy with this purchase."
5,"Great book, lots of detail","I'm anxiously awaiting spring to arrive as I flip through the pages in this book as there is about a foot of snow on the ground. I also like how it gives a lot of info. on prepping for spring. It puts me in a calm, serene mood as I look at the pictures and it gives me a lot of ideas."
2,For Caine and Frankenheimer fans ONLY,The Holcraft Covenant is nothing more than your average 80's thriller that has the benefit of having a top-notch leading man and director attached. The picture looks excellent and there is just enough intrigue added to the film's premise to keep the viewer on board the whole way. Frankenheimer displays his trademark visual flair without going over the top(as many were guilty of at the time). The one thing that really detracts from the film is it's obviously low budget and irritating synth score. It is an overall average adaptation of a fairly decent Ludlum thriller that is worth picking up only for the excellent picture quality and commentary by the director. It is a delight to hear Frankenheimer discuss one of the film's most exciting scenes being filmed and constructed around of the absence of a leading man! For Fans of the star and director only.
4,Excellent Michael Caine Thriller!,I don't get the negative reviews! This movie starts off with Cainefinding out his dad was a nazi and left him millions of dollarsto do what he wishes but he's being set up by a new nazi party!The mystery and action are very good and Caine is great as always.I highly recommend this one!
2,Urgh,"Gosh, this is bad. An utterly straight-faced, very silly spy thriller that isn't very thrilling, or even professionally put together. 'Jabootu's Bad Movie Dimension' (at www.jabootu.com) has a lengthy review of this film which highlights the badness. It all seems to belong to another time and place, a period when locations on the French riviera seemed glamorous. The writing and acting are both quite bad, and Michael Caine is very obviously paying for a loft extension with this film. There's a semi-happy ending, though - the once-great Frankenheim went on to do 'Ronin', and Caine seems to be back on track, too."
3,Good Movie,"If you like British actor Michael Caine, then you will appreciate this series of espionage movies with an international European setting which gives the movie its credibility."
1,Probably the worst Ludlum film adaptation I've seen,"I rented ""Holcroft Covenant."" If you are a Ludlum junkie and you've got to see the film, I don't suggest a purchase until you have seen the film."
1,Truly Awful,"Having just read the novel, I am sitting watching the film and can't even believe that it is supposed to be the same story. Truly truly awful."
2,"My copy of the DVD was defective,","The DVD lacked some chunks of the movie. There was no viewer menu, no ability to navigate the scenes.As for the show, it was pretty good. For some reason, however, the bad guys had to prove they were evil by engaging in incest. I guess Hollywood couldn't expect an audience to understand killing for money as a bad thing. The plot is somewhat corny and ripe for satire, but the movie has good production values. Michael Caine plays his role perfectly, of course."
1,what a stinker!,"Absolutely awful musical score (vintage Japanese sci fi screeches - by composer Stanislas, never to be heard from again) sets the mood for a poorly written, terribly acted movie that no doubt cost a bundle, had a good cast and great locations, but man they couldn't have ruined this one any more than they did!Just goes to show that even the bigger stars need any work some years, but I bet this stinker set Caine's and Tenant's career reps back at least a decade. If you insist on watching this one, be sure to be prepared to self-medicate early into the show. Don't worry, you won't miss a bit of plot - what there is of it."
2,"THE RETURN OF THE BAD BLOND NAZIS , PART ONE : THE CHILDREN","Poor John Frankenheimer ! Forced to defend a movie he has obviously directed to pay his taxes. Allright, at that time (1985), few directors have resisted the Cannon Group pressure. This company hired well-known directors, screenwriters and actors and produced a lot of bad (when I say bad, I'm still nice) movies.Now, we have a Robert Ludlum novel about a nazi conspiracy, a good actor, Michael Caine, two or three old public favorites, Lilly Palmer and Mario Adorf and an action movies director : John Frankenheimer. Result : great cinematography but a marmalade thriller which will not be the highlight of Frankenheimer's filmography.Too bad MGM chooses to present this movie because sound and image are first rate. Berlin and Lake of Geneva's country are well photographed and the first five minutes of the movie, shot in black and white, are the only reason why I don't give a 1 to THE HOLCROFT COVENANT.An unnecessary DVD."
3,A predictable thriller,"I purchased this DVD as I am an admirer of Michael Caine. At his best very is is very good, however, this is not his best. Some of the action seemed to be totally contrived and staged. I do not think the movie is one of Michael Caine's best and if he ever looked at today he would have to shudder."
3,Pretty good childrens game,"For a child who loves cars, I bet this game would be amazing. Even if they don't love cars, it should still be a pretty good game.Owned it when I was a child, and have re-added it to my collection."
3,Daevid Allen & Russell Hibbs - 'Bards Of Byron Bay' (Bananamoon Obscura),"Don't know too much about this performance, except that it took place in 1995 in front of a small crowd - Byron Bay, Australia. # 4. Plus the fact that it was (another) duet gig with Daevid Allen {this time} with Russell Hibbs - acoustic guitars & vocals. Keep in mind the sound quality isn't that great - some hissing and drop outs do occur from time to time. Still, it should somewhat satisfy some Gong followers. Songs that make for decent listening include ""Came To Find Her"", ""I Am A Freud"", the catchy ""Perfect Day In Paradox"" and ""Lord Of The Wild Places"" (maybe the CD's best track). Noticed this archive recording was somewhat humorous - see what you think."
1,Buy a text book,"This program was not what I thought it would be, it is like buying a text book for you child and having them take the review questions at the end of each chapter. It is boring and not interactive like you would expect from a computer program."
2,not user friendly,I had hope this would encourage my son to study but it doesn't load easy and it is not as user-friendly as I had hoped.
4,Husqvarna Titanium Force String Trimmer Line,"Very good line, and works well in my Husqvarna trimmer. Lone complaint is that it seems to get eaten up a LITTLE faster than the older Craftsman line I was using. All in all a good product if you can get it at a competitive price."
