2,"nice machine, but...","My brother and I have had this exact same model for the same amount of time. We got them used, but they were still in great condition. A few months after getting them, my brother's IR went out, but mine was still functional. Several months later, my mouse started flying erratically around the screen. After a day or two of that, I started getting 8611 error message booting up. It takes a lot of time and patience to get this notebook to boot up. After researching the error, I found that this is a very common problem with the 600X. When I can boot up without receiving the error message, I don't turn off my notebook unless I'm sure that I won't be using it again anytime soon.While I loved it dearly when it was fully functional, it's not worth purchasing to have a notebook that is only funcational less than half the time. My brother, however, has yet to experience any problems such as this."
4,Drop it and it doesnt break.,This is the most amazing laptop for surviving a fall I have seen. No bells and whisles but when your out in the field it will boot.
5,Fantastic!!,"Buy This CD!! It is a vanguard record, with a powerfull STORM of elevate drums and percussion!! Jo Jones play on it, too! Buy too the other great CD that is a sequence of this : Art Blakey Drum Suite."
1,Very Very Disappointed!!,"This bib made from bad quality materials, looks cheap, not worth the money you paid for!! Don't bother buying it."
2,Picture is deceiving,"The picture led me to believe that this was a multi bib pack. However, it is only for one. There is nothing special about this bib either. Save your money and pick one up at the store."
3,Disappointed becos no Adapter,I am very disappointed at buying the Nokia Compact Desktop Charging Stand for Nokia 8260 Phones because it does not include an adapter to charge the phone. The adapter provided by Nokia does not work with this charging stand cos they're apparently different sizes. And this price is way too high for just a stand ! :(
2,WRONG DESCRIPTION,"The product listed is NOT a dual charger...I ordered it and it took over a month to actually receive the product and it is a single charger. After more research, I believe that the dual charger is not yet available for the 8260, but that the 8290 dual exists. And keep in mind that this does NOT include the AC cord...you are to use the one that came with the phone or purchase an additional power cord for the charger."
2,"True, not the most useful accessory but.....","I must agree that this charger stand is not the most useful accessory for this phone. I must say however, Nokia does not claim this is a two-slot charger. Also,it is important to note that the plug DOES fit into the stand albeit - snugly. Make sure that the plug going into the stand is the right end - notice that the transformer has a ""wing"" shaped slot for the larger end of the cord. If you try to put the wrong side - the ""wing"" shaped end-into the charger it will not fit. This stand is not so useful because the charger plug is so simple to begin with. Save your money and buy a buy a case for this phone instead - it scratches too easily."
4,"Works great, not sure why the reviews are so low",I just purchased a 8260 phone from Amazon and bought this as an accessory. It works great. The power cord that came with the phone plugs right into the charger. It looks great on my desk and I would recommend it as a nice base to park your phone when your not using it. Only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is the price is a bit high for what you get.
5,"Works Like A Freakin' Dream, Others Don't Know Jack!","Let me start by saying that the other people that supposely bought the Nokia 8260 phone's and saying that their charger does not fit into the charge are foolish. There is only one way the plug goes in, the other end is different anyway, so it tells you if one side does not fit then try the other side. I bought this charger and it works like a DREAM, PERFECT, No Problems what so ever. Like I said this is a great product. They can do better on the price doe."
4,God from another planet ... that just may be possibly so!!!,"A reviewer below calls this work of literature fraudulent because, among other things, it states that God once had a physical body while living on another world. Its irrelevant to me whether or not this book is true, but that the author was daring enough to speculate on the true nature of God, which she believes to be another human being like us, albeit now way far advanced spiritually beyond any Earth human. There are those fundamentalists that believe in the inerrancy of the New Testament, but in fact much of the New Testament is itself fiction ... just read some scholarly works on the Bible for yourself. Anyway, hands-down to Angie Fenimore for daring to make God finite and concrete to us all, in place of the infinite, abstract ""unknowable"" God that we are culturally led to believe in."
3,"cute wig, but does not look like the picture and not from Disney","The wig is cute, but it does look different than in the picture..and when I ordered it I was misled by the title. I thought it would be an actual Disney wig, the wig is just a bob wig with longer hair in the front and shorter in the back...the red headband is home made and that is obvious. I got this for my four year old daughter and I'm not really satisfied with it, it's more of an olde lady wig."
3,"Short and Kinda lackluster, yet cute...","""A Time Before Me"" is just another in a long line of gay-youth orientated books from Iuniverse. At the center of the novel is a sweet and naive boy, Mason, whom the novel follows from the end of his high school experience and into the months after his graduation.The Book is separated in two, almost equal parts: a segment about his lackluster life in a small town, and the other about his adventures going out on his own in New Orleans, living with his 'crazy aunt.' But alas the book is full of cliches, and honestly never allows the characters to truly grow and learn from each other. The author glosses over important aspects of the story, and never really knows how the balance the story. You are left wanting a lot more - and not in a good way."
4,Surprisingly good,"As I started this book, I was afraid that it would turn into a preachy, all-is-good-in-the-world, non-realistic novel (a la ""A Better Place"", by Mark A. Roeder). I must say that I was completely surprised. Mason is a character you definitely start to care about. And although he makes a few classic gay newbie mistakes (why does everyone fall for the friend that is going down the wrong path?), I still wanted to find out what was going to happen next.The only thing that saddened me a little was the fact that Perrone's descriptions of New Orleans made me feel bad that I never made it down there pre-Katrina.This is a great beach/travel read."
3,A Time Before Me,"""A Time Before Me"" is about a gay teenager who moves from a small town in Mississippi to his aunt in New Orleans.Some of the characters are on the stereotypical side but others are better developed and likeable, such as Aunt Savannah.""A Time Before Me"" is part coming of age novel and part romance, with the focus on the coming of age part of the story. The romantic plot is a bit underdeveloped. The book is a quick read but the ending is something of an anticlimax of what was an overall good read."
3,A sweet comedy,Very fun German Sex Comedy. The DVD realize by MYA COMMUNICATIONS is good. It 's come with english subtitles.A must see if you are an Edwige Fenech fan.
2,gift for child.,"Not good, has eyes that could be removed and dangerous. I did not give it to the child."
1,The most horrible romance ever written!,"I wish that I had never read this book. I can't understand why Amanda loved Tony so much when all he did was treat her like dirt. Tony's mistress Letty was no better either. She did everything she could to torture Amanda, and Tony didn't do anything to stop it. Tony and Letty were one of a kind. They were both cruel, selfish, and disgusting. I kept hoping that Amanda would come to her senses and marry Nathan, a man who really loved and appreciated her. There was absolutely no romance whatsoever. Please don't waste your time with this book. It would be more fun to count the tiles on the floor."
1,atrocious,"this was by far the worst of connie mason's book I have ever read. in this story the heroine is raped by a drunk at 16 then when she is sent to newgate for stealing is again sexually abused by a constable to keep from beihng raped again. then she is made to do sexual favors by her owner for having his son. then a malicious woman gets her captured by indians and again raped. then she is forced to pretend to have sex with a slave by the same women who got her captured by indians. i thought that was horrible, i am truly dissappointed in Ms. mason considering i have read almoast all her books and this one contained what it did. i would have given it no stars but the idea behind the story was good."
1,WARNING,"I'd give this minus five stars if it was an option. Anyone contemplating reading this book must be aware that the heroine is raped, beaten and flogged (the first two by the 'hero' - that's right folks, the 'hero') and cheated on (again by the 'hero') and then raped about four more times by various other men, while the 'hero'...er...what was he doing again? Oh, yes! Having sex with his skanky mistress (who later orchestrates another rape for the heroine to endure). Honestly - a WOMAN wrote this rubbish? What more can I say? Romance it is NOT."
1,HORRID...,"I am an avid fan of Connie Mason. Before this book, I purchased a copy of the ""Black Knight""...what a remarkable book. However, I have one question concerning ""Caress and Conquer"", what was Connie Mason thinking! This book made me what to slap both lead characters. The one character I wanted to slap both ways and tell him to be a man was Tony. The things he did to Amanda; I for one would not want to go through the things she did with this ""so-called"" man. In this day and age, I do not think any other woman would stand for what he did. If he only learned to keep his pants buttoned-up. Thank you for a hellish reading. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ANYBODY. However, I will continue to purchase any Connie Mason books since she is one of my favorite authors at my own risk...."
3,If you're looking for literate SMUT...,"If you're looking for intelligent literature, look elsewhere. If you're looking for something a bit low-brow and melodramatic, then this is the book to read. I was a bit offended in the chapter where the ""heroine"" is kidnapped by the Cherokee Indians & sexually assaulted, but other than that, the book was pretty fast paced and easy to follow. None of the characters are likeable, even the heroine. The so called love interest needs a hard kick in the nads; and usually the male lead in the book has a facade of virginal tendencies while being the best lover the girl has ever experienced...in this book, he's just a man-whore. Romance novels are supposed to give the reader a feeling of hope in that there is love waiting for them out there...this one kind of left you a sick feeling after watching a bad made for TV movie. I like smutty romance novels once in awhile, and this one is by far one of the most memorable."
2,Are you kidding?,"This book rates nowhere near as good as all the others she has written. I found Tony's character to be selfish and very cruel to Amanda. She even bears his child early on and he's still his cruel self to her and her baby. His mistress is even worse! She treats Amanda horribly while Tony does nothing. If you ask me Lety the mistress should not have been in this story as long as she is. She worse than Tony by orchestrating Amanda's rape. Speaking of which there are too many of those in this book. I'm surprised Amanda didn't shoot Lety AND Tony, it would have been fitting. Come on. I read this in 1993 and its still not Connie Mason's best. Don't waste your time."
2,"Different, but not good","I've read numerous Connie Mason books, but this one is by far the worst one. I appreciated the attempt to make the story different from usual romance novels which at times seem to be the same story with different names, however, the book was annoying. The main hero was a pig, the heroine was constantly in different bad situations, and the villianess wasn't just evil, but she was sick. None of the main characters are very likable. If you are looking for a romance book that is unusual and does not follow the normal path, I would recommend this book for the simple fact of reading something that has a very different plot/characters than any other romance book I have ever read. However, I would also say that the book is very long and half-way through it I couldn't wait to just be done with it. Every scene in the book has to do with the hero being naive, the heroine is in trouble, and the villianess is the cause of some sick, twisted plan."
1,hell no!,"I can't believe i fell for that one five star review and ordered this book! this book was a fest of rape and abuse where the heroine is raped continuously from the beginning to the end by at least 6 different people the single guy who apparently loves her abuses her a bit too ,boots on necks ,forcing slaves to rape ,wardens raping, Indians raping,attempted murders ,child abuse and so on and if these are not enough you have the hero changing woman like you change gloves and enjoying it at that right in front of the heroine and she forgives him multiple times ,but still says he loves her!shocker of all shockers the ex mistress is evil personified not just jealousy but serial killer tendencies . If the absurdity of so many atrocities happening in one book, and to two people was not put down to the genre you have to laugh out loud at how comical it all was and not in a funny way!!!!"
2,150 PAGES TOO LONG,"This book so needed an editor. There were so, so many punctuation errors, especially quotation marks. The worst part is that this book is a reprint from another publishing company.The story was a long soap opera of convenience and a guilty pleasure. Let's not fool ourselves, I did finish it after all. I'll give you one guess on how the hero recovers from his three months of amnesia: that's right, he gets hit on the head again and all the sudden remembers everything."
1,don't buy this unless you are a sadist!,"too much pain and suffering in a romance novel! a few difficulties is expected, but NOT THIS AMOUNT OF SADISTIC PAIN!"
4,Maintaining the status quo...,"The Squadron/Signal series has always been good value for money and this one is no exception. The Brewster Buffalo was deservedly much-maligned due to indifferent performance, stability issues and manufacturing defects, making it dog meat for any Zero pilot. It was, however, an important factor in the early battles of WWII. The book gives little indication of the general feeling of allied pilots towards the F2A; only the Finns were able to make it work at all and much is made of that, which gives the reader cause to ask why. Otherwise, this little book covers the brief history of the aircraft quite well. The illustrations have always been a strong suit of this series and this one is among their best. Good value for money is the key here."
4,this was a big hit with niece and nephew,"i really had trepidations buying this as an xmas gift, but time was running out and i had to do everything via my computer. i did not wind up spending xmas with them because i came down with the flu, but they called me after opening this present to say they absolutely loved it and best of all they could share it. they said it was one of the main hits of the night. i don't think you need to hear anything past that."
4,Scheduling With Suretrak,"If you are struggling with the manual that is provided with the software, then you will really appreciate this book."
2,Duplicates the Uncensored Bosko DVDs,"This set only has 5 actual Bosko cartoons on it, and all 5 (as well as many others) are already on the ""Uncensored Bosko Volume 1 & Volume 2"" DVDsFrom Volume 1:Ain't Nature GrandBig Man From the NorthBattling BoskoFrom Volume 2: (which has long been unavailable, so this Cartoon Craze DVD may be your best bet for these two for a while.)Bosko ShipwreckedBosko and HoneyThe next three toons are from the Famouse Studios DVDs.Sudden Fried Chicken (1946)(Herman the Mouse)Stupidstitious Cat (1947)Hep Cat Symphony (1949)Then there is an interesting foreign cartoon:Mr. Rossi on the Beach (1964)"
2,dissapointing...,"I know no one who appreciates this man's music more than myself.From the early days of the enraging Jam to the sophisticated eletronic-pop-soulful-bossa nova Style Council to, finally, his latter solo carrer..I like it all. This record, however, does not live up to its expectations. I agree that the selection is one of good taste, but that's all there is to it. The title is misleading, since he does perform any of the songs here, and some of them are a bit difficult to live with. Let's wait on another brillant record from Paul. He deserves it and we do too.."
1,My daughter couldn't finish this!,"Sorry I bought it. She loves the Nutcracker ballet, so I thought she would like this! I was wrong; she came and said, ""Mom do I have to finish this? It's boring!"" Wish I had rented it for 48 hours instead of buying it!"
3,3 stars for sets and costumes,"This production gets 3 BIG stars for design! The sets are wonderful and deserve 5 stars! I have to deduct one star for the weird sexual undertones in the Drosselmeier/Clara relationship. It's bizarre and horrifying! One star off for giving Clara and the Nutcracker the Sugar Plum Fairy/Cavalier pas de deux. It's okay when ABT does it for Baryshnikov, but annoying for any other reason. If you are looking for a wonderfully accurate version I suggest you rent the SF Ballet one.Tchaikovsky, P.I.: The Nutcracker (San Francisco Ballet, 2007)"
4,Great version but Amazon's data is wrong,"This is a beautiful version and my children love it. We're anxious to see this at PNB in Seattle next year when the kids are old enough for it in-person. However, Amazon's cast list for this is totally inaccurate. No stars in this one - just PNB dancers."
3,Attractive coffee table book...,"This is an attractive coffee table book. It is not as informative as I had hoped, though. The text is poorly written and just doesn't get into the depth I was looking for."
2,Not the best...,"I bought this controller used and am taking it back.The batteries have a tendency to fall out mid song since the cover doesn't hold the batteries down well especially if you are enjoying the wireless aspect and are running around.The buttons are more difficult to push and are spaced differently from the standard controller. The whammy bar is not as responsive and accurate and the tilt sensor is more difficult to activate.The guitar is also smaller than the standard controller.As a plus however, the wireless does work quite well and I never had any problems with it.Overall the guitar works O.K. as long as you don't want to ""rock out"" too much and risk knocking the batteries out. If you're looking for a cheaper second guitar for when your friends come over this guitar will suffice, but be prepared for your friends that play with a normal controller to blame this controller for their mistakes."
5,Comfort Guitar,"This controller is smaller and more comfortable to use than the normal guitar. In our experience, we get better scores with the smaller guitar than we do with the full size guitar. The version of the guitar that we have is wired only, which is great because there are no batteries to mess with."
5,Excellent case!,"The Ericsson leather case is hands-down the best cell-phone case I have seen. Your phone is almost completely enclosed in the case, which significantly diminishes wear on the phone. And your phone is held horizontally - no more having to swivel the phone so it doesn't jab you in the leg or the gut. You'll forget that you have your phone with you! It's easy to get the phone in and out of the case and you can use the vibrating alert on the KF788 while the phone is in the case.The case has held up VERY well in the year+ that I've been using it. There's no question this accessory is worth it's price."
1,"bulky, clumsy case","This is one of the worst cases I've seen for the Ericsson T28. I returned it the same day it arrived. The T28 is a small, quick-operating phone that becomes very bulky and slow to access in this case. It's a hopeless design--a case that is better suited for eyeglasses.I bought a...third party case that protects the screen (the main point of a case) and still allows instant access to the flip-out panel, volume control, and recharging ports. It protects the phone from abrasion, but fits snug and maintains the thin, small, and wonderfully pocketable size of the T28. Unfortunately, none of the Ericsson cases offers these abilities."
1,nothing useful in the book,I get this book in college. I am student of CNC studies and machining. This book did not have the knowledge we need and teacher did not like useing it because mistakes in it.The CD does not work for almost half our class.Vic
1,Terribly simplistic,"I take exception to the previous reviewer's statement that the average machinist reads at a grade 7 level. He must not confuse his own reading skills with those of others working in the trade.CNC Workshop is a big disappointment. As the other person pointed out, you can get far better simulators (freeware) from the web. There is very little of use to anyone but highschool kids in this book.Buy Smid's or Mike Lynch's book for REAL cnc knowledge."
4,Non-interupt system problems not as evident with this unit,"a common problem for all speaker phones whether you're at your office or in your car is the mic-interupt feature. This is a necessity for most phones to eliminate feedback, cutting off the speaker as soon as you begin to speak. This unit does the best job of keeping this irritation to a minimum while stille using the speaker. of course, if it's still too much of a walkie-talkie sinsation to you, you can always use the included ear-piece to cut it out all together."
1,Not really wind chimes,I too was looking for a CD of wind chimes. The wind chimes were over powered by the ocean. I did not find the CD relaxing at all.
1,OCEAN,"This CD should be called 'Ocean'. Can barely hear the windchimes, think I hear a background of a sax, which might make it a little more interesting, but not much. Waste of $$."
1,"Should be called ""Ocean Waves""","If you like to hear the ocean you will love this CD. If you want windchimes do not buy this. Disappointed to say the least. Maybe the Goodwill can sell the CD for something, cause that is where I am sending it."
3,Andre Isoir at his medium best,"The choir in this piece gets 4 out of 5 stars. The only reason it gets an overall 3 is because whether it's a combination of microphone misplacement, or lack of engineering, that the organs do not sound as rich as they could be. I am an avid Isoir fan, but I think I'll be selling this disc on eBay."
1,"It's a Behringer, what do you expect?","Unit works intermittently with Logic. LCD goes blank and the faders slam to the lowest position when a session is opened up. A call with tech support yielded no help. He was irritated and passed on his frustration to me because his computer wasn't working (maybe Behringer made his computer too?). Now I have to ship this unit back on my dime so they can send me another one. Anyone want to buy the one they send back to me for real cheap? I'll be unloaded every Behringer product I have and will only buy real gear. Not gear marketed towards the cheapest home studio around. Do yourself a favor and save up a little and buy a real DAW controller, not this one."
1,I have a question,I was out the other day with my boyfriend and he was looking for the plastic carrying case for the phone. The one that hooks on his belt and he couldn't find it anywhere. He has one for his pager but he doesn't like the leather one that the phone is in. He has had the plastic one for the phone before but he has broken it. We need to find a new one and I was wondering if anyone knows of a place I could buy one. We were in the mall and all the phone places didn't carry them. I don't know where to go next. Thanks for the help.
1,"Beware, Phone Falls Out! and No protection for faceplate","Ok, I'm glad I'm not the only one who's phone has fallen out of this case. ONLY buy this case/clip if you want to carry it on your belt, not for protection, but be careful! My phone fell out of the case today at lunch as I was leaving and the LCD is now broken and does not display ANYTHING. The phone does not come unclipped, the weak velcro that holds the case closed around the phone just comes undone, and the phone slides right out. But also, it does not provide ANY protection for the face, the most fragile part of this phone, and so the face is very scratched. (but this also is an inherent design flaw in the phone itself) So now I am going to have to replace my phone because this case/clip does not provide any protection and actually is prone to not holding the phone. Back to the drawing board, guys."
1,The most worthless purchase I have ever made,"I bought this case thinking that it would protect my phone, but it does not come close to doing that. There is absolutely no protection for the faceplate, in fact hardly any leather to protect anything. The phone is also prone to falling out of the case easily. The case does not even do what it claims to do, ""enhance the beauty of the phone."" What a piece of junk. Do not buy this case unless you want to destroy the beauty of your phone, which I think looks quite attractive without a case, and potentially destroy the phone itself."
1,lost phone,"As reported by other people, this carrying case really looks nice, *but* you will lose your phone. I got the carrying case for Xmas, lost the phone on January 10. It separated from the clip."
2,Nokia case alternative,"After reading posted reviews, I found I must attach the holder to my belt, then attach the phone and case to the holder. It looks like a very useful case, but since I don't wear a belt often and wanted to hook the clip to the top of my jeans, this case wouldn't work. I instead purchased a Motorola StarTac case. I removed the inside plastic from the top half of the case and attached Velcro to both top and bottom. I now have a case with a clip, and it closes to protect the front of the phone. It's still easy to remove the phone from the case for use. Thanks for your reviews, they helped a great deal."
2,phone falls out,This case attaches very well to the belt clip but the problem is that during the first few weeks of use (and sometimes beyond) the phone can fall out of the case. The phone is held in by a velcro peice near the top of the phone and it can catch on stuff (like a coat) and come undone. Then the phone falls out (but the case stays firmly attached to my belt. Also since the case does not cover the front of the phone there is nothing to protect the display on the phone and it tends to scratch very easily.
1,YOU WILL LOSE YOUR PHONE IF YOU USE THIS CASE,"Though the clip on the phone is nicely designed and sturdy, the actual leather case leaves much to be desired. The case is barely large enough to strap over the top of the phone. This, along with the limited velcro surface area, cause the strap to come loose easily. Furthermore, the phone attaches to the clip on a rotational pivot, allowing the case to turn upside down on your belt spilling the phone. I lost my phone 2.5 weeks after receiving this case."
4,NOT ONE FOR ALL FOLKE'S,"Folke is an oberserver from Sweden for a scientific experiment documenting the cooking habits of single males in a town in Norway. When he is finally admitted into Isak's home he sits in a tall chair and keeps track of Isak's movements in the kitchen. Folke is forbidden to talk to or interact with his subject. Folke becomes frustrated with his job because Isak preferes to cook in his bedroom instead of his kitchen. Folke has to break the rules to break the ice with Isak. They become fast friends and when Folke is forced to return to Sweden when he is fired from the job, Isak finds he can't live with out Folke.This was a very funny film underneath the moody and gloomy landscape. The chair and the tear drop trailer are just perfect. Isak's friend is really corky. This is an easy one to watch and one I will always enjoy viewing"
4,"a funny, gentle, touching gem from Norway","This sweet, low-key film from Norway took me by surprise. It unfolds slowly, with dry wit and growing affection, as two middle-aged men, one from Sweden, one from Norway, put aside long-established mutually-engendered stereotypes, suspicions, and mistrust to establish a new grounds for friendship. Patience with the deliberate pace will reward the viewer with a richness and satisfaction rarely found in films today. Definitely a keeper for viewers who enjoy movies like The Castle and The Station Agent. Could easily be 5 stars were I not so annoyingly parsimonious."
3,Great but...,"Great read and I am loving the language. BUT there are no exercises for one to practice with! ARGH.It would be a far better book if there were exercises so one could practice the concepts just learned. It one thing to go ""Yeah, I get that"" but it's another to be able to reproduce it with the right syntax etc. Anyway, not to diminish the greatness of the book but it whetted my appetite for more Ruby but left me hungry. I ended up using PythonChallenge.com but it's not mapped to the book so it made it a little more difficult to learn."
1,"Overhyped, Overrated...","This book is written by an expert in Ruby. An expert in the language, perhaps, but not an expert in writing teaching books. This is NOT a book for beginners, despite what it says on the jacket. The examples introduce multiple concepts at once which simply serves to confuse anyone trying to come to grips with what is a very complex and sophisticated environment. And there are simply not enough examples. Perhaps if you are coming from another OO environment you won't find this book so obtuse. But for me, it skims over the most complex subjects in a breezy manner which simply frustrates and infuriates.I hated it."
3,"Good, but far from perfect.","This book is a great reference, but the tutorial is somewhat confusing. This has two main reasons:1. Ruby itself is a somewhat confusing language. Really. Don't believe all the hype surrounding it. I'm not saying it isn't good, but it uses lots of concepts which aren't that common in other languages and the syntax is unnecessarily bizarre sometimes. Python has everything Ruby has, but it's *always* legible, clean and - let's face it - beautiful.2. The top-down approach of the tutorial isn't efficient if you've never programmed before. I have a good deal of experience with other languages, so it was quite straightforward to me, but if that wasn't the case - and this book is also targeted at the newbie audience - I'd probably be lost sometimes.That said, this is still THE book to get if you're interested in learning Ruby, at least until someone writes a better one."
3,Good but not for newbies,I am a fairly confident procedual programmer with a little bit of object orientated programming experience (1 semester at university). I like the syntax of the language and the book did a good job of demonstrating this. If you haven't been taught OO programming you may find this book difficult to understand. I had to go back and look at some old java text book to understand certain concepts.Overall the book is OK. It could definatley use more examples and real world scenarios besides the jukebox example. The bulk of the book is a reference library. Not that this is a bad thing.
4,Programming Ruby,I found this book to be very informative. I am new to Ruby however I have read many other programming books. This book is comprehensive a very good guide for examples for code and most of all the book is laid out in a very comprehensive way. I had no problems finding code concerns that I had and needed to understand. This book is for the serious Ruby programmer.
5,Must have for any Ruby programmer,"I'm not sure how much the times have changed, but I got the second edition of this book on pre-order. At that time it was a fantastic references. It told me everything I ever wanted to know about the Ruby language. From the nice tutorials at the beginning to the excellent language and API reference toward the back. It even goes into some of the nitty gritty implementation details and has a chapter on writing C extensions."
2,Not for a Java programmer,"Information is set in a haphazard manner. Cannot get a clear picture of how a Ruby program is structured.For ex: Chapter 4 is on ""Containers, Blocks, and Iterators"". Chapter 7 ""Expressions"" again has different information on Loops, Iterators, For ... In, Variable Scope, Loops, and Blocks etc."
1,ad hype,it is a nice programming language until you see HP cloun services operating in their tiny internet room and mam whatever hoping to save some money by fusing that spirit into the service. go south and keep on spinning
4,All the information you need,"A Great way to learn ruby and a great reference guide once you have - contains all the information I needed to learn ruby, clearly set out in a chapter progression that facilitates moe advanced learning as you go along."
2,not that good,"Sorry but to me this book is not that good. I feel like the authors lack real programming experience. The JukeBox example seems out of a bad OO book, and I found few real-life examples.As a comparison I also recently red 'Dive into Python' from M. Pilgrim and wow! the difference was striking. I wish I could find a book like that on Ruby."
3,Not their best,"If you're starting out with Tarentel, I recommend ""Order of Things"" before this cd. Tarentel have a nice touch with mellow, minimalist ambient, and a track like Ghosty Head is particularly beautiful. Ephemera comes across, however, without the transcendence or beauty, and it comes in a bit short on time. Tarentel fans can make up their own minds, but this is not the place to start for an otherwise fine minimalist ambient composer."
5,Ephemera is Ephemeral,"Simply put, Tarentel knew what they were up to in putting together this record. From the sprawling 'Looking for Things' and 'Searching for Things"" to the ambient guitar feedback of 'Two Sides of Myself Part Two' this record nails down the post rock genre. I personally find this music to be soothing and I frequently put it on as I drift into sleep at night."
5,"Great Product , low power feature excellent",This 56k modem has a low power consumption feature which is very useful in prolonging the battery life of a handheld. I have tried other pcmcia modem but this is the best one of them all. Definitely worth the purchase.
5,Charm Bracelet,I ordered the bracelet for my daughter's birthday gift. She loves it. I haven't seem it yet. I'm in Afghistan.
2,Decent sound. Poor construction.,"I've had these for two weeks. The silicone ear pads fell off in the first week and I had to replace them with aftermarket foam ones. Now, the metal screens over the ""speakers"" are falling off.The sound is pretty good, though, and I like having the volume control on the cord. It's a shame they aren't built better."
2,i luved them so much they fell apart,"I wear my headphones religiously. I just bought these 4 months ago and after nearly daily use, they're falling apart. The comfort cushions went first, then the inner screen, now the wiring is failing and sound is spotty. I also have a hard time keeping them on or in my ears, the over the ear piece was too big and provided no help.These are good for occasional use."
3,Very pretty,I got these for my 24yr old daughter because she likes pink. She borrowed her brother's blue ones and they broke easily. A friend's pair didn't last too long and I guess I expect these to break soon with normal wear and tear.
3,Beware! - Small Ears,"Other reviews stated the comfort of this product and the adaptability for people with small ears. If they fit my small ears, I believe they would be very comfortable. Sound quality is good - but did not work for my small ear problem."
1,"Fine while they work, which is not for very long","They were comfortable and all that while they lasted, but that was only about two months before the internal wiring started failing and I could only hear from one ear and then the other, and then only when I twisted the cord into three loops held at a just-so angle... I use headphones every day, so I expect this end to come to all of them eventually from being pulled in my bag and generally subjected to heavy usage. But usually, a $15 pair will last at least 6 months before needing replacement. These fail even the cheap stuff durability test."
1,They hurt my ears & their return policy stinks! Don't buy them!,"These didn't fit in my ears. They are very uncomfortable, and after an hour on the treadmill, they actually made my ears sore. The second time I went to put them on, I noticed the rubber cushion was missing from one ear piece. Luckily I found it in my gym bag, but that tells you they are easy to lose! And one size doesn't fit all, but they have only one size rubber cushions.So I wore them twice and got disgusted and threw them on my kitchen counter with the thought ""I'll return them to Amazon later."" Well, 32 days later and I finally read their return policy to find out I'm 2 days late AND I would have gotten only 80% (at the MOST) of my purchase price AND I would have to pay the shipping for returning them.Thank goodness I'm out only $13. I ended up going to Target and paying $30 for great ones from Phillips. Because of their lousy return policy, I'll never buy from this dealer again. Beware."
1,Poor fit for runners with ears like me,"These kept falling out and falling out until I pitched them into the dumpster 10 minutes into my first run with them. And, who on earth needs a volume control along with a six foot cord to the ear phones. When is someone going to understand that people need about 18 inches between ipod and ears?!?!"
3,Mediocre,"The piece that goes over your ears is softe and flexible, but the casing on the ear buds fell off fairly quickly, and I then had to insert the hard plastic into my ears, which wasn't comfortable. The volume control is terrific for running or at the gym so you don't have to fiddle with the Ipod. After about 5 months of fairly heavy use, the headphones just broke completely. So I don't think this is a well constructed product, but the volume control is a nice feature."
5,Great Great Ear Clips,"This is the BEST ear CLips I've ever had! LIghtweight as it advertised, it's really really soft that makes me feel so great even with my glasses on. I've been suffeing because I love clips type, but most of them can't stay along with my glasses. But this iLuv one works perfectly. It's also great for bed use. I can simply feel nothing but music around! I'd like to get another pair in another color! (it'd be awsome if it's available to change covers :P)"
4,Love my new earclips,"I have sensitive ears, and the earbud type earphones that are included with iPods, etc really hurt my ears. So, when I saw these, I was pretty excited to try them. They are great! They don't hurt my ears at all, and they stay in place well!!! The ear clips are soft, smooth, flexible plastic, so are very comfortable; and the part that goes in your ear is even softer. I'm not really sure what to compare it to. The only problem (if I had to come up with one), is that they are so flexible, I haven't quite mastered applying them quickly--it takes an extra second or two, but that is fine by me. It is well worth it for the comfort!"
4,Extremely comfortable,"These are super comfortable and easy to pack for travel. The soft rubber ear clips are excellent for extended wear. These are NOT extremely high fidelity, but they allow you to enjoy your music and still hear the world around you...sometimes a necessity. For noise canceling, you'll want to find something else, but for general use when you need to hear the kids, or traffic, or your boss, these are unbeatable for comfort.The small bud fits right into the opening of the ear, but the ear pieces keep it there. Unlike ordinary ear-buds, these don't fall out. The ear clip is very soft, flexible rubber that you can wear for hours without discomfort. I have lots of these so that I have a pair wherever and whenever I want."
1,Horrible for Running,I wore these for a run and couldn't even believe how bad these wore. I ran 3 miles and by the first half mile i had to take them off because they kept bouncing out of my ears. If you sit still these are decent headphones but even walking makes these bounce out. I have normal shaped/sized ears and was greatly dissatisfied with this product.
5,LOVE THEM!,These are super comfortable and they actually stay in place! The sound is great and they work well with all types of audio/multimedia players. I especially like them for my laptop. They don't leak a lot of noise so I am not bugging everyone else around me. Its fun that they come in all sorts of cool colors!
2,iHate,"I love ear clips. These I hate. I think my ears are ""average"" size. These will NOT stay on my ears. I cannot imagine trying to be active while trying to use them! The ear clips are a bendy rubber material. It does not bend or adjust at all. I wish I could return them.On the positive size, it has a volume control on the cord which is nice."
1,cheap earphones,the product is crap. The first one I used broke the first day. I guess if you buy cheap you should expect cheap. I wore them while I walked and they just do not last the wire broke at the plug.
4,iluv headphones,"I really do like these iLuv Ear Clip Headphones. What I don't like is that the little rubber rings come off easily and get lost. Without these rings they are no longer comfortable to wear. The rings, make for comfort but also, I think, they help block out back ground noise.I could not find replacements for my first set of headphones' lost rubber rings. I bought another set of headphones and lost one of the rings after about 2 weeks. I tried the little foam/spongy covers but they won't fit, unless the rubber rings are on. I like the headphones because they are lightweight and not as ""big"" as some other headphones. I have 2 sets of headphones and one set of the rubber rings between the two. If I lose another ring then neither one of these will make me happy. It would be nice if we could buy replacement rings. I'm thinking I may have to look at other brands."
2,Too bulky on tiny ears,"If you have smaller ears, these aren't for you.Admittedly, buying earbud headphones has been troublesome for me because my ears are smaller than average, so I expected to meet with problems when I ordered these. The part that wraps around the ear is actually very flexible, but far too large, and the actual ""buds"" are big with the cushions attached (remove the cushions, and they aren't bad).The sound was average, not mind-blowing.Add another set of headphones to the casualty list."
1,Lasted one week,They fell apart within one week of normal/light use. The headphones that you get for free on airplanes are of higher quality.
2,Large bud- wont fit in ear.,"The item is deceptive, it looks like it is an in the ear phones. The product mainly hangs off ones ear, and the plugs are too big to fit in a normal sized ear lobe. hence they just hang off the earlobe. sounds ok, but does nothing to block off ambient sounds."
1,not pleased with purchase,"most reviews online ranked this product fairly high. unfortunately, i was not pleased with the purchase. the pieces were too large for my ears, so they did not sit comfortably. also, the sound quality was so bad that i could even hear the words to my songs."
4,Comfort,"These are designed for comfort. They do not fall while running and are great for those who like to fall sleeps to music. The sounds quality is not so great. The volume control in the cable is a nice feature. Overall, good deal for the price."
4,"Lightweight, cute, and comfy","I've tried many earphones over the years, and I ordered these for my new iPod nano because I hate the ones that come with them. I was very happy with these--they seem to hang just right on my ears, and the large surface of the speaker makes listening easy without too much fiddling around. I'm not an audiophile, so I'm primarily looking for comfort and ease of wear instead of hifi sound.Unfortunately, the connection went bad after a couple of months, which I think was my fault from leaving the earphones connected to the iPod in my purse. Since then, I have tried two more inexpensive sets other than these--which were terrible, so I'm trying again, and I'll be more careful!"
5,great!!,"I like these because they STAY PUT when I exercise and I can still hear the music very well even if they come out a little from my ear canal. I also REALLY like the volume control in the cord. It makes it so easy to turn the volume down to interact at the gym. Plus, blue is my favorite color! Enjoy!!!"
5,These don't hurt!!,"Bought these because the ones that came with my ipod hurt my ears soooo bad! These hang over the ears and don't put a ton of pressure against the inside of my ear, and still give good sound. I also really like the volume control on the cord - don't always have to get to the ipod wheel to change the volume."
2,"Cute, Portable, okay sound and thats it","I bought this after a friend recommended it when I complained about my earbuds hurting my ears. The price was nice however I watched the entire 1st season of Gossip Girl on my Ipod and after 2 hours of wearing these my ear was in more pain than my earbuds caused me!! The do no fit well since I also wear glasses :( My ears hurt for a few days afterwards. The sound was just OK not great at all for music, they did well with watching something or listening to podcast or audiobook. I would not recommend these to anyone who wants to hear music."
2,"Good sound, poor construction",The ear buds fell off the same day they arrived.Not well constructed. Sound is good.
2,Not Durable at All,"These headphones seemed just want I wanted when I got them. They fit well, were comfortable and sounded great. However, less than a month has gone by and the wires have broken right off, near the volume control. I have been careful and stowed them in a case after each use. Even $20 headphones should last more than a month. I will not buy them again."
1,Terrible!!!!,BEWARE!!! The first pair I bought broke after about a week. I can only get sound out of one ear. The second pair I bought had the same problem from the moment I took them out of the box. I will never buy these again!!!!
2,Broken wk 2,"I thought I had gotten the best deal in ear buds for the first week. It is comfortable, lightweight, love the volume control on the cord, stays in place during exercise. The soft plastic cover on the ear bud fell off the 2nd week. I was able to put it back on. But it proceeded to fall off again with every use. Too bad they can't fix that problem, it would be great, but until then, wouldn't recommend!"
1,Don't stay in ears,"Maybe I just have weird ears, but these would not stay put, even when I was just sitting still. Everything else was great (quick delivery, etc.) but the product itself was just shoddy. I hope I just got the one bum pair, but it's something to consider if you are thinking about buying these."
3,Is the problem my ears?,"I'm sure these fit someone's ears, but they don't fit mine. I've been looking for earclips that deliver decent sound and don't require a lot of fiddling. I can't wear any sort of earbud in one of my ears, so I liked that these had the option of being worn either in or out. The problem is, they don't fit either way. Maybe I have the world's smallest ears, but these don't come anywhere close to hugging them, which they'd need to do to stay in place. The sound is very distant as well. I like being able to hear sounds around me when I'm walking to work, but I also like being able to hear my music. I've tried wearing just one in-ear, and that doesn't work either. When I did success in getting it in briefly the sound was much better, but because everything about this earclip is large, it was too painful to be worth it. Should I be looking for child-sized headphones instead?"
3,good sound short shelf life,"These iLuv earphones with ""ear handles"" have good sound, a good price, and the handles help them stay on your head since it's rare to find plugs that exactly fit your ears. Unfortunately, the rubber sealers that fit the ears fall off and lose themselves in the bedclothes and eventually a wire works lose so that only one side of the earphone works. Not bad for under 20 bucks. I bought three pair four months ago and I have one left that works on both sides and I cannibalized the rest for the rubber sealers."
2,Fell apart after minimal use :-(,"Bought these for use with my laptop and loved them - but alas, the good times were not to last. First the rubber thingies fell off, then the screen for the soundpiece fell off. I can't use them at all now since I can't find replacement pieces to repair them. It's a shame, they were super comfortable with good sound - just shabbily constructed.Spend the money to buy something of higher quality, you'll be glad you did."
3,EARBUDS,THEY ARE HARD TO PUT ON BUT ONCE ON ARE PRETTY GOOD. MAY BE MY EARS. THEY STAY ON WHILE MOWING THE GRASS AND THAT COUNTS WITH ME....
5,I luv iLuv headphones!,"Comfortable, great sound, volume adjustable. I got them as a gift last Christmas and bought these to replace a pair that my husband lost and a couple extras for gifts. Happy to find them at Amazon for a good price."
3,Review,I used these headsets for about a month then lost the rubber earbud-so now I can't use them at all. I did like being able to control the volume. They were comfortable to use-but now have to go look for another headset.
5,Great headphones,"Great headphones, the best for workout, wouldnt slip, volume control, I use it with the mini Ipod and is great!"
1,Arrived unusable,One of the ear phones didn't work right off the bat. Very disppointed in this product!
1,second pair,i am throwing away my second pair of these ear buds...1 bud keeps going out and you know how annoying that is when you are working out...ugh! so it is frustrating and another $10 down the drain.awful awful ...and will not buy again
5,A great Follow up,"I was very excited to hear that audio karate had a new release. Their previous album 'space camp' was an excellent mix of great guitar work and great emotion filled vocals which left other bands of its genre far behind. On the new record we find the same, if not more, creativity behind the guitar parts. And vocalist Art actually seems to scream a lot more on this album, yet the record sounds just as melodic as Space Camp. There is a slight change of style however, they took a step away from their pop punk intirior and replaced it with more emotionally charged breakdown parts. At first the record seems a little slower and is harder to get into then Space Camp was. But after 2 or 3 listens this record proves itself to be more inspiring and original then Space Camp."
2,Not That Funny,"It does have its funny moments, but it's not laugh-out-loud funny like Little Britain (which I recommend).It's kind of boring."
4,Brilliant observational humor,"Catherine Tate is very talented. Her characters are hilarious, and her ability to do such different types is amazing. Her supporting cast members are also quite good.Americans may have some difficulty understanding the accent(s), but for the most part her scenes translate well. It seemed to me that there were sketches that had been cut from television so it was nice to see some new things. However, I was puzzled as to why there were no extras included on the dvd. I would have loved to have seen interviews, bloopers, etc."
3,Tate,This one was ok. We did not like it as much. So it was just OK.This is not fun. This was not to our liking.
1,WITHOUT A THOUGHT,"Tavis Smiley is an empty headed provocateur who has been attractively packaged by a bevy of handlers. This book is pathetic and trite, hardly worth the paper it was written on. I got the book because it is Smiley's earliest, but he is about as simple then as he is now. Black American ought to be ashamed for embracing this lightweight as a spokesperson."
1,CRAP!,SPONGE BALL is more like it only lasted 3 weeks then the ball started loosing shape. could not use it for practice wouldn't track. as a play ball maybe but still morphed into a oblong shap after the kids played with it
3,"product great, packaging not so much.",everything on the packaging was in Spanish... I gave it to a 5 year old who reads. So needless to say I had to turn it into an educational opportunity. It would have been nice to know that up front though.
4,Great Starter Soccer Ball!!,"Especially if you have SpongeBob fan in the house! My 16 month old is already a major SpogeBob fan. Plus she loves to throw and chase after various toy balls. I was hoping this soccer ball would inspire her to having an interest in kicking a ball around with me. Well, it definately gets her attention which is good because this ball keeps her from getting bored with kicking the ball around with Dad. I'm glad I got it. She gets extremely excited when I bring this ball out and she takes great interest in carrying it, throwing it and running after it. I think this will help get her involved in the kicking aspect rather quickly as she gets a little older.The ball itself is great quality. It looks and feels durable enough for some years of abuse. The graphics are durable and eye catching.So if you want an attention holding soccer ball to start leanring the ropes or just playing around, I think this one is a winner...especially if your kid is a SpongeBob fan like mine is."
3,Hours of fun,"Bought this to wear out the dog. He will chase this longer than I want to run him around the house. Good value, works well with interchangeable heads."
3,Better off paying the extra bucks from the pet store...,"I bought this so the cat could have some chasing fun. I paid a dollar for it through amazon, but ended up paying $6 in shipping. These things can be found at the pet store for about $6-$8 dollars anyways and then you'd have the option to return or exchange it.So... I don't know if it's just this vendor, but this particular laser is cheap... the switch is glitchy and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. I've owned others, and I can't say they are much better built, but this one seems a little more sub-par in craftsmanship. The only sort of neat thing is all the different projector heads you can put on it that it comes with. They are pretty much useless as the plain ole dot is best for kitty chasin, but kinda neat to see them all... after that... they just become garbage.A so-so buy. Better to just get one next time you're at the pet store."
3,Summary,"OOP! <B>She was a gambler and a winner. Would she risk everything for one man's embrace?</B>Beautiful, passionate, ambitious,Raven McCord used her charm and her gambling skills to escape the poverty of post-Civil War Texas. Left penniless by her father's excesses, Raven made her way to the top of the demi-monde as queen of an elegant gambling casino.Though still obsessed by the memory of Mark Bennett, her first, lost love, Raven was drawn to two powerful but very different men--Carl Randall, rising cattle baron, devoted and determined; and Devery Scott, wealthy author, aloof but magnetic. When Mark returned, she was forced to gamble all on a choice that would determine her happiness--and the future of her daughter Rebel, as lovely and headstrong as Raven herself."
5,Wonderful ideas...,"to help a friend with a chronic, painful illness. So many times people say ""let me know if you need anything"" and they mean well, and while flowers or a card is nice, this book includes very useful ideas that really do make a difference in the life of a chronically ill person.Suggestions such as ""changing her sheets"" or ""mop the kitchen floor"", while small things, really add to the comfort of someone suffering with arthritis or other painful illnesses. This book even includes ideas of what not to say to someone who is ill. All in all, a gem of a book. Wish I had found it sooner."
5,Probably the best book about marriage and families that you'll find!,"This insight to the purpose, member roles, and ideal structure of a successful family is invaluable. It was written by a professor at Brigham Young University. It takes a spiritually oriented approach accompanied with just plain common sense so that can benefit anybody."
1,Gods of ancient Crete,"You want /good/ temping advice, go to notmydesk.comYou want pure dreck, buy this."
3,Too cute for its own good,"Hasset has some unbelieveably good and comforting things to say. I'm temping in New York right now and, after reading the book, feel much better about it.The humor, however, was too much: humor should be a spice to delicately flavor instead of a sauce to drown.Too many asides: too many jabs in the ribs and knowing winks. Get on with it already!Some segments were so downright poorly written and confusing I had to go back and read them two times to figure out what he was getting at.I did like that he wrote from a temp's view instead of a client's. He understands that there's a lot we'd rather be doing at work than working. He shows how to get around it. It's great."
1,Mossadegh:The Same Old Story in favour of MULLAHS!!,"It is a collection of articles from a Conference, nothing new,nothing more, nothing less! The future came and gone with the departure of MEHDI BAZARGAN, who was an important figure in Dr. Mohammad Mossadegh's period of time, and, tried, again, to form the government in 1979, but was overthrown by MULLAHS in 1979.FINISHED. FINISHED. THANKS."
2,rating-movie cut explicit matters out,"i enjoyed this movie for a long time\i did;nt like that some of the scenes were cut out\\like the rape scene-and some fight scenes,overall the movie was great..............."
5,3 y/o son loves it!,"It's a big toy, but no problem for my 3 y/o to easily lug around. His sister prefers Dora to fly the X-wing; who am I to argue."
4,"Great card, but one significant complaint","I'm using this card in a Mac Pro. Performance is fine, and the card does pass SMART data and temperature to OSX (several other cards that I tried don't). Unfortunately, drives connected to this card never spin down. Doesn't matter if the computer has sat idle for hours (with the internal, and Firewire drives having spun down), the eSATA drives keep spinning. Same thing when the computer is put to sleep, or when the drives are unmounted from the desktop.Sonnet tech support confirmed that the card blocks HD sleep commands.It's not a deal-breaker, but still a disappointment."
5,Works Well,Product was easy to install and works as prescribed. I am running a 5 drive enclosure and it works great. The only thing I have not figured out yet is how to display the drives that are attached during bootup. Not a show stopper however. Will purchase the product again.
2,Great card if you don't use sleep mode...,"This card was super easy to install and it worked immediately. I have a 2011 8-core Mac Pro. The only problem....if your computer goes to sleep, it won't wake up unless you reboot. There's a compatibility issue with the Mac sleep function and the way the card operates, which I confirmed with their support people. Basically if you use the sleep mode, you're SOL."
2,Buggy Mac OS X driver,"This card works well for fixed installations. But if you intend to use eSATA docks where the target drives come and go the Mac OS X drivers are buggy. The effect of powering down or unplugging a drive connected via this card is that an internal data structure in the OS kernel is left dangling which causes a several minute blue-screen delay when logging out or shutting down.I'm a software developer and have sent several bug reports with loads of diagnostics but after 4 months nothing has been done.Obviously, if I'd known their software was broken I would not have purchased this product."
5,"Nugent is a subtle, powerful writer!","Live Girls is a novel suffused with an unforgettable atmosphere; the world it conjures can't easily be forgotten. Anybody who cares about the craft of writing (particularly aspiring writers), should read this book to learn how much can be done with a first person, intimate narrative, without 'writerly' showing off or horrible sentimentality. Yes, it's dark and creepy, but people who criticise the book on this basis seem to miss the point completely. I wish Nugent would write another book. Is there another book I don't know about?"
3,Darkly comic novel of a girl who loses her purpose.,"Actually, it isn't sure that she ever had one. But anyway, I loved Nugent's first book, City of Boys; and I find the same scary, detail-ridden, enjoyable (if you don't insist on taking it seriously) sense of humor here. I've read some negative reviews and I want to tell them, lighten up. No need to be like, or judge, Catherine to follow her journey."
2,Depressing and pointless.,"I *loved* Nugent's prize-winning story, ""City of Boys"". It'sone of my all-time favorite short stories. But the charm ofher style is not enough to carry a novel in which nothinghappens, which has no likable characters, and which presentsa world which is so pointless that it's not worth readingabout. Sorry to say this, but don't waste your money -- ortime! -- on this book."
1,"Morbid, Unfocused, Depressing","I'm all for what I'd call cynical-aesthetic if there seems to be a point to it - if there's a place that it's all leading me towards in terms of understanding human character or experience in this end-of-the millenium maelstrom we live in. But this novel, which starts well enough and kept me reading so I could find the point, just didn't have enough of one. (Yes it's tough being unloved by your parents and living with memories of a dead sibling in a world in which women are objectified, blah, blah, blah. But then what?] Makes me want to return to 19th century fiction frankly - or at least some of the 20th century writers who know about plot, character, and dare I say it, IDEAS! If you want existential female angst go back to Joan Didion's 'Play It as It Lays.' Now that's a book. Lucky Beth Nugent, though. The porn-show theme gets her published - earning her some money and some readers - which says more about our world than her novel does. Don't waste your money or time."
4,"Heavy stuff, but interesting","This is a book by a scientist, and he was writing for other scientists--But it can be read by anyone with an interest. The author watched a prairie dog town for several months a year for over a decade, marking each of the animals so he could track individuals. He describes details of how he made his observations, but most of the book describes the habits and social behavior of prairie dogs, just as the title says. The book has a LOT of detail, but is readable and interesting. Some is rather surprising, such as prairie dog mothers who attempt to murder their nieces and nephews, but who, if they don't succeed, will nurse these same infants a few weeks later.Recommended, if you want to ""know it all"" about prairie dogs! For less intense studies and gorgeous photography, look for ""Prairie Dogs, Sentinels of the Plains."""
5,Just about everything you wanted to know...,"For those interested in learning IN DEPTH about prairie dogs in general--and the black-tailed in particular--this is the book to have. There are probably better books that discuss PDs at a more introductory level. But if you want to get serious then you need to go to the experts, and Dr. Hoogland is ""it"" when it comes to this fascinating and important Plains animal. The writing is not light, but is certainly readable and understandable for a non-academic reader. The author's passion for his subject is evident throughout, and the lengths he and his team went to to complete their research is fascinating as well."
3,All for one and one for all,"""Sister Girls"" was an enjoyable read. Although, I expected more from the author, based on Angel Hunter's previous works.The story is one based on the friendship of four professional Black-American women, in different stages of their lives; all having different concerns to come to terms with.Crystal, a rape victim, has to come to terms with her rapist, the rapist's so-called father, her biological mother and also a high school sweetheart who is now a police officer in her state.Susan has to come to terms with her substance abuse addiction.Elsie has to come to terms with her sexual preferences or is she really in the closet with it?Jewell has to come to terms with her baby's daddy and her dating/love preferences.The fashion in which these four ladies lives are entwined is both interesting and special. Even though I enjoyed the book, it really didn't gain much interest until I was near the center of the story. All in all, it's still a decent read.Star Rating: *** 3.5"
4,Co Workers,"Sometimes the people you work with become your extended family which Crystal, Susan, Jewell and Elsie soon learn.Crystal and Susan have been friends since college. Once brainstorming they decide that a law practice is the right things for them. They are tired of working for someone else when they can get the job done on their own. With finances and other obligations they decide to bring in a third member, Elsie. With Jewell interviewing and hired as the receptionist/secretary, this rounds up the group of professional black women.Each woman goes through their different battles and learn that sometimes you need a someone to lean on, who will not judge you and can let you know when you are wrong or right, the definition of a sistergirl.Though at times the story gets a little too predictable it was a good story with a good thought to it. I don't think these ladies were necessarily sistergirls but close coworkers."
1,Don waist your money...,I just got done reading this book and was really upset that I waisted my money on it. The title was all wrong becuase it seemed as if these girls barely knew each other and all of there story lines were so cheesy. I higly recommend that you borrow this book from someone or the library instead of buying it.
4,Sister's With Issues,"This book wasn't bad. It goes to show women from different backgrounds, can throw their egos away, and become friends. These women deal with issues such as being raped by a father, drug addiction, accepting their sexuality. I liked it."
3,"if you must read this, borrow it from the library","I agree with the other reviewers.....this book was just O.K. It's one of those books where you find yourself skipping pages so you can get to the exciting parts. Unfortunatly the exciting parts never come. This book deals with homosexuality, rape, drugs, and a bunch of other issues. For all the drama that these girls had, the book could have been a whole lot better. If you're a reader who loves suspense, excitement, interesting characters, I would suggest you try Drama Queen and its sequel No More Drama by Hunt instead. Shiesty, Black, and Down Chic were good also. If you really want a spicy read, read Swingers.However, if you must read this book (and if you have a lot of spare time) borrow it."
3,not what I expected,"I was not pleased with the books, I purchased three only read one. It was a big disappointment. I will just stick to the authors that I am familiar with..like Zane, Yoshe, Jerome Dickey."
4,Pretty good,"Worth it for those who really enjoy the hymns. Not as strong as the first 3, but still some strong music, and of course, as always, amazing lyrics."
1,"For it's time... eh, it was still crap.","When I bought this light it was one of the few LED lamps available for on-camera use that were under $500. Even with that caveat, it really was pretty abysmal. It definitely created a serious hot spot of light (when it had enough reach to hit the subject in the first place) and, most importantly, installing and changing the batteries was so complicated (they had to sit in the compartment JUST so or the light failed it work. I had to keep a piece of gaff tape on the back of the light to help hold them in even with the door in place.)"
2,Disappointing,"I saw the Trinidad Steel Band in a high school assembly when they were touring the United States. I remember their performance being vibrant, energetic and magical. This CD is not, sadly. The recording itself it poor (very muffled). There are a few pieces with flat vocals that would have been better left off.There is something interesting and wonderful about steel bands. You won't feel it listening to this CD. Sorry."
2,Fans of the original - run away,"For fans of the original recording of the Journey to the Centre of the Earth concert (1974), this version will probably be a disappointment. While the original recording does have its flaws (most reviewers would reference the vocals here), if you're like me you've been listening to it for the better part of 30 years, and by this point the ""flaws"" are as ingrained in your appreciation of the recording as the keyboard artistry of Rick Wakeman. The music is mostly the same, but there are some key differences, most notably (to me) the part right after ""...and in silence, they waited for the storm..."". To make it even less enjoyable, the narrator sounds like Eric Idle doing a Saturday Night Live parody of the recording.In short - stick to the original."
3,Did you like Sword and Fist?,"If you liked Sword and Fist, and/or you are interested in playing a Cleric or Paladin character, this is a good book for you. It has alot of new spells, new armors, new prestige classes (some of which are very cool) and of course, new FEATS. So really, anyone could use it, no matter what character class you play. On the other hand, if you are looking for alot of ""source"" matierial, or ideas on how to play these classes, then this book will disappoint you. It is very much a RULES book, expanding the mechanics of the game but not the culture of the game. The exception to this is a nicely written section on various kinds of temples and what one could expect to find in them, but I found this information to be a bit obvious. The best reason to buy the book is for the new spells and feats. If you aren't interested or cant keep up with the ones alreay out there, you will do well to save your money."
3,The older book was better,"I am referring to the Complete Guide to Paladins for 2nd edtion. That book had far more material in greater depth than Defenders does. Again, this book also seems underdone, like so many 3rd edition books. The most useful material was the section describing how the faiths of specific alignments, and deities, work. As for the rest, it is ""overbalanced"". Most of the feats are so ""balanced"" as to be worthless, as are the prestige classes. The kits found in the Complete Guide are better, I think, with real balance, not +'s and -'s canceling each other out. The organizations listed were a little better, but again, the Guide had more interesting ones. Although I have focussed on Paladins, the same holds for priests. The Complete Guide to Priests wasn't that good, so I can't recommend looking for it. Overall, I wouldn't bother buying this again just four about 10 pages of useful material."
4,Church Lady's Revenge!,"More than Sword and Fist, Defenders of the Faith is geared towards those characters with a religious bent. The four divine spellcasting classes have power-ups here. More spells for you to pray for and an overview of most of the major faiths as described in the Player's Handbook arranged by alignment. The feats are geared more towards clerics and paladins but many of the items in the equipment section can be used by anyone. In fact the illustrations are rather useful for both players and DMs alike. There are even suggestions on how a pc relates to a particular temple as well as how to handle the day to day workings of these houses of worship. While it's geared mainly towards clerics and paladins, rangers and druids will find things they can use here as well."
3,Third Edition,"This third edition for paladins is a big step up from the 2nd edition Complete Paladin's Handbook. For kits, here called prestege clases, they offer very little drawbacks to special abilities with the sub class kit. Also explains evil anti paladins, who are embodiments of evil. As members of the warrior group, your paladin can use any weapons and any armor. A paladin is a holy knight, similar to a straight knight class offered in the third edition in the sense you're supposed to always be lawful good in alingment. Knights also have spells and can use any weapon and armor. The Complete Fighter's Handbok 2nd edition offered paladin like kits without the foolish stuff of a straight rigid paladin. I like it."
3,Not as good as I hoped,"While it does have some useful feats, it's selection of new magical items and prestige classes are below par. It lacks the requisite Dragon Slayer prestige class and any new Holy Swords. Also gone are the days of wonderful full page pictures."
3,don't buy and expect to find useful information,"I have mixed feelings for the book, I like the fact more spells, dragon mounts, new mounts, new items, etc.. I am disappointed as always on the prestige classes (the ones in book vs sword and fist are not even interesting but still have the ridiciulous prerequistes and not worth effort special abilities and the book doesn't even deliver a good multiclass paladin/ prestige class character). It seems that wizards has developed more hideous broken material for metagamers to hide fact rest book worthless: divine sacricfe (I fell out my chair when read this, unbelievable), haste armor (all the time, no charges, no 1/day), metamagic feat (deals +cha modifer damage, unbelieveable) and everything else seems feeble. It seems wotc can only make unbelievable unfair and broken items/feats/spells or totally worthless feats/spells/items. If wotc doesn't produce something worthwhile with realms books, they will have proven the naysayers right."
3,Ordered two sets and got pink spoons for both!,I agree with another reviewer that amazon should either sell gender neutral spoons or sell the pink and blue separately. The spoons I received are an annoyingly bright hot pink. Buyer beware that you are probably going to get pink spoons.
2,Too big for my 7M old mouth,"I don't like them that much. The handle has a strange shape that makeit impossible for my daughter to hold, plus it is too big for hermouth so she's just playing with it and not eating from it.Another thing is that in the picture you see 2 blue spoons and I got 2pink ones (I have a daughter so it was ok for me).I have to add that my baby eats preaty well with other spoons (gerber and the first years)"
5,Toddler spoons,"These spoons are easy for my two and a half year old, twin granddaughters to use. They are able to glide the food from their plate to the spoon. Because of the design, the food stays in the spoon, giving them a sense of accomplishment and independence."
5,Perfect Spoons for Toddlers,"Our Occupational Therapist recommended these spoons for our 19 month old twin boys. They were having a hard time with all of the other spoons on the market, but figured this one out right away. They are perfect for eating Cheerios, yogurt, applesauce, etc. Due to the holes in the spoon, the food is able to stay on easier without sliding off. The handle is curved perfectly for little toddler hands to grasp. I went out and bought spoons for all of my friends with toddlers. They are hard to find."
4,good spoon,"i just got these, and my daughter loves to feed herself...but i thought a fork comes with the spoon, not 2 spoons...all in all, its easy for her to use"
3,We must be doing something wrong...,"The other reviews rave about how the food stays on the spoon...I'm not sure what we're doing, but we must be doing something wrong.Right now, my daughter is 1, and still used her spoons more as toys than as utensils. I get that. But when I do get food on her spoon and she does get it in her hand and starts moving it to her mouth...the food falls right off.I got the spoons because of the great reviews that the food miraculously stays on the spoon...but haven't actually experienced that yet.Disappointed and hoping for better results as we use it more..."
5,Perfect for little hands,"These spoons make it easier for my son to eat yogurt, oatmeal, or anything else in his bowl. The handle thickness and width are perfect for his little hands and the angle of the bend really helps him make it to his target (his mouth). We've liked other Sassy spoons, but these have been the best so far."
2,Not impressed - Nuby beats this,"I bought these spoons because of the good reviews, but wasn't impressed. The holes weren't a problem, but didn't seem to be a benefit either. The handles are just too short. Not only did they usually end up down in the bowl, but they weren't easy for my kids to hold. We much prefered the Nuby spoon & fork set, which we got at Walmart under their store label. They worked great from when the kids first started feeding themselves, and my 4 year old still prefers it over a metal spoon."
1,Censorship,"I rented this DVD from Netflix, and had high hopes for it. It was rated NR and would contain graphic sex scenes ala Shortbus and 9 Songs, however I was horrified to see this little grey circle censoring any naughty stuff. This completely ruined the viewing experience for me, and I would caution anyone renting or purchasing this DVD to make sure they get an uncensored copy."
3,Strange psychological thriller,"Strange introspective study, full of Bergman references. Australian dancer goes missing for 12 days then returns, disturbed. Films that rely heavily on imagery are rarely very successful and this is no exception, though it is refreshing to see a new director who is not afraid to try a new approach. Tom Long is exceptional as the lead and the dance sequences are both very impressive and perturbing. The plot is too diffuse and fantasy-laden, however, to make a real impression. Has been tagged as a gay movie, which is absurd, though there is a very strong and at times expicit sexual element. Possible interpretation: thoughts of death destroy sexual desire ? Curiosity value."
4,"Works well enough, but the cost....","This battery from Nokia, honestly works pretty well. It is the battery that comes with your phone if you own the Nokia 8260. It charges and keeps charges pretty much as the manufacturer has rated it. I found the battery life lasted maybe even a little longer than Nokia had rated it. This in part, may have something to do with my service provider. I would definately reccomend you stick with this OEM battery - the aftermarket battery I bought weeks before this one, didn't really last long at all before it died on me. As far as the price is concerned,well... I am mystified by what seems to me to be excessive. This battery alone cost about half the cost of what I paid for the phone itself. However, this is not a consideration if you spend enough time on the phone to warrant the need for another battery."
5,Knitting: The Baby Surprise Jacket,"A great addition to a knitter's library. Anyone could follow the directions given because you can stop and restart the video, anytime. That way, you don't lose your spot. I found the video to be a great assist in completing this beautiful jacket. I'm glad I purchased it! I also learned a few new tricks along the way. A very relaxing way to knit an Elizabeth Zimmerman baby sweater. I wish there were more project knitting videos like this one out there. It allows already experienced knitters to hone their skills and inexperienced knitters to avoid the many pitfalls. Thank you for offering this winner! I wish I had purchased it sooner..."
1,This is not the 2004 film by Emir Kusturica,This is not the 2004 film by Emir Kusturica despite what the search engine says.
5,The best Nokia Product,"Folks, dont think about it. Just buy it and beleive me, you will be very happy and safe using your cell phone at the car. Beleive me, its the best thing i ever purchased."
2,No Suction,"Either I have the world's strongest 13 month old, or the suction feature on this bowl is non-existent."
2,Little Suction,"I bought this suctioned bowl and one other (the Munchkin stay-put) hoping that one of them would actually stick. I like this one slightly better because the rubber suction part comes off for washing, BUT neither one of them really suctions that well (this one marginally better than the Munchin) on our high chair tray or wooden table. Suction seems to be better on our glass coffee table, but of course that's NOT where we need it!"
2,Disappointed performance,This did not work for a 10 month old. First serving and baby pulled it off and the rest... well imagine the mess. The material is of quality. Sassy Baby Less Mess TODDLER Bowl ... did not deliver.
1,Horrible,"I gave up on this movie about 40 minutes in. The trailer looked intriguing, but the body of the work is voice-over translations of incredible stories told by a long-bearded, Austrian man whose life story is incredible. Production quality is terrible as well. Do not bother with this movie. I'm sure there are dozens of better produced UFO clips on youtube alone. Should not be in highest rated."
5,Cute Raccoon,This pet is soft and very cute.The Negatives about Webkinz are the glitches and sometimes it takes a while to get on.Positives are you get to play lot of fun games and decorate your rooms.
5,Rascally Raccoon,"The Webkinz raccoon is Super Soft and Cuddly. Great material/quality. Get your hands on this Rascally little guy, before his price sky rockets, just like many other RETIRED Webkinz. He was a wonderful addition to my ever-growing collection."
4,Its a Webkinz,"Its a racoon Webkinz, not an encyclopedia. Get it if your kid likes Webkinz and racoons. Otherwise maybe get them a dog Webkinz."
5,Very cute and my daughter loved it!,My daughter became a recent fan of Webkinz and I wanted to get her one that was more unique. I found this one and it is adorable. She is happy logging online to play with it virtually and also takes it along with her during the weekends.
5,Webkinz Raccoon is Champion,"My 7-year-old son has the Husky, the Yellow Lab, the Brown Arabian, and the Raccoon in his Webkinz collection. The raccoon is by far the cutest, and he is also the smartest in the online ""school."" He named his Risky, and has had way more fun than I ever imagined he would with a stuffed animal. We haven't had any of the problems with the Webkinz website that others have mentioned. In fact, it has worked like a charm and is easy for my 7-year-old to manage with very little assistance. These toys are Champion, the raccoon especially."
5,Webkinz rock!,"I had never heard of webkinz till late '07.We moved just before the start of the 07-08 school year and several of the kids there had webkinz.So of course my kids had to have one too.Well, they are really cool and a great learning tool.They come with a secret code and you register it online at webkinz world.You get to name it and print an adoption certificate.Online they do things to collect ""kinzcash"" they get to purchase things for their pet's room.They also have to feed it.If they dont it gets sick and it has to see the doctor.I just think they r great.It helps the kids understand there are needs that come before what they want.And this was a fabulous seller too.I'm sometimes leery of ordering from 3rd party sellers but ""angieskidzone"" is topnotch."
3,Bladed warped very easily,"I thought the knife was great until the blade started warping. The blade seems to be made of really weak metal. I only subjected it to normal cutting ( opening boxes, letters, etc.) I expect more from Cold Steel. I like their products, but this one did not meet my expectations."
5,"A superb blade! Very sharp, well balanced, cuts quick and smooth.","I own one of these knives and it's one of my favorites. The solid piece of metal that this knife is made of makes it very certain in your hand, and they also got it very well balanced in my opinion. I don't mean for throwing, since I don't throw knives, but I'd bet it would be great at that too. Despite what the blade looks like (a cross section would be a triangle), it is VERY sharp and cuts through tough stuff very fast and very easily. Be careful, because you can slice your hand wide open and not even feel it, don't ask me how I know. All in all it's a great blade, I think everyone should have at least one if not two or three or four or ... well, you get the idea. Hope this helps!"
3,"Good, but not what I expected","It is not a book for those looking for reference or technical information.Besides, do not expect to have a view of pencils in general but italian."
5,Excellent Set!,If you were a teenager in the 1990's and tweenties in early 2000's these directors were a vital part of music culture. Be sure to check the other Director's Label Series from Palm also.
5,Extra content not so good,The new videos and interviews are not so good. If you are buying this box buy it for the original content. This extra content is really not so good.
4,As natural and honest as you're likely to get,"Four and a half stars actually. A documentary classic for sure, from one of America's most important filmmakers. The choice to interview his own parents pays off big time, as they're willing to get much more personal with Martin than they would with a stranger. The interaction between mother and father in front of the son, who's already a longtime participant in their relationship, and who they're already accustomed to pointing cameras at things, is as natural and honest as you're likely to get. The recipe, the stories, the threat on the cameraman's life: Classic. Of Scorsese's shorts, only American Boy with Freddy Prince gets a higher rating from me; and why is that not part of one of these DVD boxed sets? Release it already, what are'ya waitin for!?!"
1,A totally ridiculous book with almost no content,"This book is a waste of money, there's almost nothing in it. It reminds me of the terrible ""Presenting C#"" book (although I will grant that it is much more accurate).Any other C# book is a much better buy. For example, if you want a quick treatment get ""C# Essentials"" from O'Reilly. For learning C#, get Archer, Liberty or Gunnerson. For a complete application oriented book get Troelsen."
5,It's a Carhartt-need to say anything else?,"It's a Carhartt, you get what you pay for and these are great work horse jackets. Bought through Amazon solely on price and color availability. The product speaks for itself."
5,carhartt jacket,"I purchased a carhartt quilted-flannel lined duck jacket for my grandson.We were very pleased,not only with the fit and quailty,but the price plus free shipping."
5,Excellent Jacket,"This jacket is excellent but not perfect. I am 5""10"" and weigh 180 pounds and the jacket fit perfectly. I ordsered a XL. The bad is the hood. As you can see in the picture it kind of lays high on the neck. This makes wearing a hat difficult, the hood keeps pushing on the back of the hat. I am hoping the hood will lay more flat with wear. The zippers were a little bit rough at first but with some wear they move smoothly. My previous Carhartt jacket lasted about 5 years and I hope to get the same life out of this. The materials used are the same as the old so I am expecting the best."
3,WAY TOO BIG,"Ok, so I took my chances and ordered a Large because that's what my husband's size is in Carhartt jackets. It came and I wasn't surprised after reading other's reviews that it was way too big. Otherwise, it is exactly like picture."
4,Great Value,"This jacket is a great value. The external Duck fabric is tough but not rough. I bought this and the Arctic lined jacket at the same time. The quilted lining seemed warmer, so I kept this one and returned the other. Other than the lining, both jackets are exactly the same. Below are a few key observations:Pros:1. Durable2. Warm3. Nylon lined sleeves keep shirt sleeves from riding up when putting the jacket on4. Lot of jacket for the money5. Wind resistant6. Quality zipperCons:1. This runs small. I weight 160 and the medium is well fitted. It also runs short.2. As another reviewer noted, the front hand pockets are small and unlined. They will provide no warmth in the winter.3. Stiff at first4. Attached hood can get in the way"
2,jacket,"great warm jacket but its a little stiff and the wrist fold in, i hate that because then snow gets in there"
5,Wonderful product!,"My husband uses Carhartt jackets for work - and he's a coal miner. Since they held up so well to heavy-duty use, I bought one for my father. It'll probably last him 10+ years, considering we live in the south, but he loves it! It fits well, is extremely warm, and was a big hit.It also came exactly 2 days after ordering. Wonderful service."
1,coat color,"Be careful and inspect the color of coat prior to using and washing. After my husband foolishly washed it, (because it was so stiff), he found out that one side of the coat was black (is what he ordered)and the other side was dark blue. This was also true of the hood (one side black and the other side dark blue) Some lighting make it look normal and with other lighting it is very apparent. We returned it for another black coat, but I fear that because we washed it they won't accept it. Amazon was quick to replace it but they have strict policies on washing an item prior to returning it. My husband said that shouldn't make a difference since no one would wear it anyway whether it was washed or not. The replacement black coat looks great and the way it is suppose to look!"
2,QUILTED DUCK ACTIVE JACKET,"It is a very solid and well made jacket, but not what I had in mind for a soft, comfortable coat. The company was great about taking the return and credited my account."
4,4 1/2 stars,"This coat is stiff to start but should loosen up with wear and washing.The good:nice and warmlooks to be weather proofthe inside doesn't grab clothing ( like fleeces) so it is easy to layerplenty of pockets, easy to get toThe bad:heavythe hood doesn't detach and is hard to get out of the waysize appears to run slightly smallThe ugly:needs a commercial size washer to wash or by hand"
4,Keeps me warm,"Great, warm coat. Having trouble getting used to the hood/collar when driving. It is bulky, between my head and head rest in my truck. These coats come a bit large which is great if the weather is extremely cold so you can dress in layers.I would recommend this coat to anyone who will spend long times outdoors this winter."
5,Quality coat,"Carhart is a good, quality brand. I have never purchased a inferior piece of clothing for my family in twenty years."
4,Good coat,"Good coat, great Carhart quality. Sizes run big though. I previously had a size large (5'8"" 150lbs), & it felt big, so I ordered this size medium, & it feels about the same size. I wish I would have went even anothe size smaller."
5,Best Carhart overall!!,"I bought this coat for my 16 y.o. for Christmas, HE LOVES IT!!!Five yrs ago I purchased the same coat for my now 20 y.o. and I knew it would have the same Carhart quality.I was NOT dissapointed. WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!I HAVE FOUR BOYS!! The 22 y.o. was jealous :(MAY PURCHASE AGAIN FOR THE 8 Y.O. :)You can throw this in the washer/DRYER EASY!!!My son works at the local feed store, and on cold days it works great!!"
1,satanic drivel at its worst,"A relic of the Satanic Panic days of the early 1990's, this book should be consigned to a museum and NEVER read by anyone who doesn't understand that it is obsolete, out-moded, disproven and utterly bogus. If you do read it, pay special attention to the sections wherein the author discloses her lengthy mental health history. That explains the rest of the foolishness."
3,"""Advanced"": A Tricky Word","This book certainly gives positive, helpful, compassionate advice for sexual abuse survivors who are ready and willing to take some serious steps in their healing, and for that, I've given it the stars I have. However, the promise of advice for the ""advanced"" healer fell somewhat short for me. So that's why I didn't give anymore stars--that disappointment factor. Most of the ideas presented actually seemed more suited for someone just beginning the healing process--and perfect for a beginner who's interested in knowing where his or her healing journey could take him/her. So, if you're a survivor just beginning to heal and are ready for some real, straight-forward, solid advice and information, go for this book...if you're towards the far end of your healing journey, rest assured you already know most everything this book has to tell you."
2,Is this too much to believe?,"It is difficult to absorb all the information, especially the person just beginning to heal. I'm not sure what I believe, but I am definitely skeptical. The author did not even know of her abuse until hypnosis. Her memories were not recovered until this time and the abuse was so horrible,almost beyond belief. Often, while reading, I caught myself thinking that it could not be true or that the author had gone to far. She is very quick to suggest that it is 'always abuse.' I would not recommend this book to someone just starting to seek help for abuse issues."
3,This book was okay but...,"I wouldn't put this book on my list of top-ten most helpful for survivors. Ms. Finney addresses a variety of questions survivors have, however, I am weary of any book that recommends recovering memories through self hypnosis...the author herself did not remember her abuse until she was under hypnosis. In this age of False Memory Syndrome hysteria, it is probably not the best idea to go digging around in ones past with self hypnosis...."
4,Different Banco,"It's a great CD. It's a different CD. I would call the music more streamlined (if that's an appropriate term), with lot of emphasis on vocals and lyrics."
5,The Hunchback 1997,This was a wonderful movie. I am look forword to the DVD when it come out. The acting was great. One of the best movies in a long time.
5,Great movie,"Looked for this for years- I dont even know if DVD was released in the US. Canadian but still plays great. Great movie drama- lust, anger, greed, ambition, sorrow, WONDERFUL ACTING. Fast service from seller- Thank you"
4,For a Wonderful Grandchild,This book was shipped directly to my grandchildren in Australia. Therefore I haven't seen the book & don't know whether it has arrived. Sorry
5,Outstanding,"Sells is a first-rate martial artist, and this video is an excellent production. It shows not only the three kata from several different angles and different speeds, but shows the bunkai for every move, something all too rare in martial arts videos. Moreover, his bunkai are realistic, devastating, and not contrived, unlike many ""bunkai"" on martial arts videos. Bravo to Sells, who also has written one of the best and most complete books on Okinawan karate, ""Unante."""
3,Not too bad,The capacity is not that high. But good enough for most of the Nokia 8260 or 8290 models
3,Not exactly the same as the real test.,"Well, I was expecting something that would let me gauge the difficulty of the ACTs and the practice tests in this book, didn't really cut it.First of all the English and Science problems were way too easy in this book. It gave me a false sense of security as far as timing was concerned. Actually that was my main problem with this book, so it would be best try to finish these tests with at least 5 minutes left."
4,Heartwarming,"Standing The Watch is a heartwarming story that will take you through a range of emotions, including tears and laughter. Author Rebecca Brown guides the reader through her father in-law's final days which she and her husband lovingly attend to in every way. The couple brings an attitude of honor and gratitude to a time that most people turn away from. If you are worried about death or taking care of a loved one who is dying, I highly recommend this book."
2,title is not the same as content,I expected this book to be useful for preparing for the proficiency exam . It is so Academic and doesn't help me at all
4,One Man,"I bought these to go a long with my (Biolite) stove for my bugout/camp bug.These pots weigh nothing there super light the fold up tight so they don't rattle, and the mesh bug is nice as well to hold them together. Great for cooking one man meals and hot drinks.what I dislike about it is there no hand guard for them they get very hot need to wear gloves or use a rag to hold them. There size is great for one person but that about it, if you're looking to cook for a group you going to need a bigger pot."
4,Very handy for the little ones.,"The minute I gave these to my grandson, he knew they were for him and him only. They were easy for him to grip and use."
2,Pointless Fork,"Our experience with the E-Z Grip Spoon by Sassy was fine, but it is wasteful to package it with a useless fork. Read more about our experience with Sassy utensils at Raising An Omnivorous Child on wordpress. Check out ""Pointless Forks and Perforated Spoons"" in the Dec 2009 archives."
3,Good CD for someone who collects her CD's.,"A very good CD, with lots of all songs from Mexico, if you are looking for a nostalgic CD, this is the one!!"
3,A Fine and Determined Woman's Tale,"It is a very readable thriller, like almost all the thrillers by Stephen Leather. But I like it best for the invention of a delightful woman who was a long suffering housewife, wedded to, and then separated from a gangster. But she turns the tables on him and makes off with almost all of his ill gotten gains, not forgetting to invite her husband to join her!The gangster is less convincing that other such characters created by Stephen Leather, but his wife is absolutely delightful. She makes the novel a comic thriller (if such a thing were possible!)."
2,Not all it's made out to be...,"I was pretty dissapointed in this album, especially since most reviews I've read are very enamored with it. The only song I liked on the album was 'Paranoiattack', the rest were not up to par with what I expect from the Faint. My personal favorite would still have to be Blank-Wave Arcade."
3,Oh how I wanted this album to be better...,"I'm not saying that the new Faint CD is terrible, I can give it a good 1/2 a listen and some of the songs get stuck in my head enough to make me put the CD in again, however as far as I'm concerned it gets a bit tough to listen to all the way through.It started off great, but I got bored 1/2 way through. Very disappointing since Danse Macabre was one of my favorite CD's in 2002-2003. Glad to have it in my collection, but all it made me do was want to listen to Blank Wave Arcade or Danse again. Not too impressed!"
4,Pretty Sweet,"This is a great danc-y album in keeping with your typical ""Faint"" sound. There are some great songs on here (Southern Belles, I'm looking at you) but there are overall more low points on this disc than there were on Danse Macabre. Certainly, this record is dancy and hot, but overall I'd rather listen to Danse all the way through than this one."
5,Synth Candy For A Ritalin Addled Age.,"I love The Faint. Danse Macabre was a masterpiece. And the follow-up is more of the same. Synth candy for a ritalin addled age, i mean that in a good way though. You can danse to it, and I think that you should, cause i do.If you like this album check out The Rapture, The Sounds, and Broadcast (which is a bit slower but in the same vain i think)"
3,I would like this more if the songs didnt all sound the same,"There is no denying that The Faint is a great band, with techno, emo, pop-rock they have changed the underground emo scene for the better, however this album, unlike Dense Macrabe, has most of the songs with the same exact beat and the same exact tone of his voice. Now there are a few gems(Dropkick the Punks,I dissapear, Southern belles in London sing) but for the most part even though most of them are alright all of the songs sound somewhat the same. So, in contrast buy Dense Macrabe instead, but if you are a MAJOR Faint fan this is just what you are looking for."
2,Drenched in boredom,"2 1/2Indie electronica that helped mildly pave the way for acts like Panic at the disco to break through will be as good as you consider that reference, as I find the disc nowadays to remain merely competent throughout, featuring decently produced but ploddingly predictable edginess."
5,White Mountain Puzzles Washington DC,White Mountain Puzzles Washington DC. This puzzle presented a challenge. Fun for the whole family. Guests would stop by and put in a piece or two.
5,Cool and Gothic looking Anime,"This is it, the last trio of epsiodes that brings up more questions rather than answers. The last two epsiodes are a real mind trip and makes you want to do two things. One, take a step back and say ""Woah"" and two, take a second look at the epsiodes to see if you miss anything. While this series dose end with one ot the biggest cliffhangers that I have ever seen before, and while you don't know how it end you do get the feeling that things are going to be a little, despite the fact that you don't know for sure. While this did make me a little upset that there was only 13 epsiodes, half the scripted epsiodes which were 26. It was still a fun and wild ride."
5,The Great Climax to Series One,"First of all, if you want action this is the best of the four volumes. It gets very confusing near the end, but I'm sure it will pay off in the second season. These final episodes are the coolest, and one of the best things is that it introduces the fact that there are other Bigs;Roger isn't the only one with an awesome megadeus. I don't like the last episode though. It's scary.(laughs)"
5,chrome cover,i been looking for one of these for a while.excellent product and a good price and was deliver on time
4,A must have for the lady in waiting~,"Read the book once, then go back and use this wonderful devotional guide to help you. It helps you look deeper into your own walk with Christ and your spirituality as a ""lady in waiting"". It really doesn't matter which lady in waiting you are - married, divorced, single, widowed. This book and study guide go hand in hand. You can look back and see how you've grown in Christ."
3,good raw material --- good stories ---- not great analysis,"Untold and almost lost history of labor battles in Hollywood in the 30's and 40's. Good solid information, lots of facts, but not really strung together as well as one would like. It's the raw story of the Industry, and the way it used the Mob to keep out the Communists, while decent progressives got smeared, smashed, and squeezed out cause caught in middle. Which is already more analysis than the book offers....if you're willing to take the raw material and analyze for yourself, it's worth giving it a read."
4,Insightful,This book is great for people who want to understand literature and how it pertains to stereotypes.
1,Season 3 Digital Transfer Quality Stinks!,"What was this studio thinking? The digital transfer quality on Seasons 1 & 2 is good overall. However, Season 3 is another story. It stinks! Many of the episodes are bleached (color-wise) and blurred. Looks like they confiscated some used video-tapes and did a transfer using a consumer-end VCR with no digital enhancement other than adding chapters (one thing that was nicer than Seasons 1 & 2). And even the transition on some chapters is noticeablely chopped (almost like some one stopped the playback while still recording). My guess is that the studio's greed set in and they decided to accelerate the production timeline for Season 3 and get these out on the market at the sacrifice of quality so they bring in those $$$ faster. For such a wonderful series as this is, it is a crying shame to see such a low quality transfer to DVD as Season 3 is. I purchased Seasons 4 & 5 which I have not yet viewed. Hopefully they are not as pitiful quality as Season 3."
2,"""What an assume Christmas present!""","I ordered this DVD set for my wife who is a huge Little House fan. I was confident that this was one of the best Christmas presents I ever gave her. My wife loves it. She had been taping episodes for quite some time from a TV station that didn't come in very well. Nearly everyday after she got home from work, she would watch the episode that she had just taped, even though she's seen all of them many times. Well, now that she has the 1st 3 seasons, she still watches an episode after work, but instead of the fuzzy picture on the VHS tape, she watches an episode on DVD. I must admit I end up watching some of them myself. It's unfortunate that no one makes quality shows like this anymore. A lesson to be learned in every episode. (By the way, the picture quality is fine, definitely not an issue for shows that are more than 20 years old.)I think I even learned something from the episode we watched after work today."
4,"Nice, but packaging could be better","It's a really cute, nice train car, but since the tree logs are not attached to it, they should have been better packed. The loose logs could have broken or scratched the train car (it didn't in my case, but I was just lucky). Overall it was good for the price."
5,"Excellent product, brand and price! Can't find these in any office supply store!","I'm so happy that these disks are still available for purchase! I have a whole box somewhere that I can't find, so I had to order more. These seemed to be the best buy for the amount of disks that I needed and a good brand name. They were in the original wrap, so they were new as was stated. I've already used one, and it works just like it should. I have an old Sony Mavica camera and I find it easier to use, and it takes better pictures than any of the other newer digital cameras that I have. Maybe the others are just too technically advanced for me?! If I need more, I will definitely buy from this seller again!"
5,"great price, fast delivery, great performance",Does exactly what it is supposed to do. No problems at all. Makes backing up computer data from Microsoft XP possible.
4,Added Bonus,This volume has more episodes compared to the first volume. These compilations provide variety the GBA.
3,Fun. I guess.,"This game is great, until about three days of watching it. The best episode is That's Life. The most boring one is Father Time. Overall it's really funny. I reccomend it to all Fairly OddParents fans."
1,Buy it for the cover picture only,"Just because someone puts the word ""Masonic"" on something doesn't make it worthwhile for a Freemason to buy. Such is the case with this CD. The music quality on high-end equipment sounds like it was being played through the 8-track in an old AMC Pacer. If you were looking for music for anything to do with a lodge presentation - or even your own easy listening, don't waste your money on this or its sister product, Volume 1. Really poor sound quality."
5,Love it :),"I love my lime green phonewrap! The soft wraps are the best for the v2397 phone and I would highly recommend any of them. It's nice because they provide the phone with extra grip and a bit of bounce when you drop them :).Buy it, it's worth it.. the generic wraps that you buy from the kiosks aren't as high of a quality.. spend the extra couple bucks and get the authentic Motorola accessories."
2,Where is this going?,"Im really starting to get fed up with Leisure Books altogether. Most are mediocre writers with no skills to develope dimensional characters, interesting plot (if any at all), and believable diolouge.This book is a prime example. The premise sounds interesting enough, Bram Stoker meets Jack the Ripper, with a couple of other Victorian writers thrown in, but it goes no where. Most of the book is sappy, pointless diolouge.I give it 2 stars because I liked the idea, nothing more."
4,"Not too bad, not too bad at all","Yes the book was not entirely accurate but it was still beautifully written. It kept my interest from the very beginning and I could not stop until the last page. It has a great story behind it, and is extremely descriptive (do not not read while eating or if you have a weak stomach). I loved the book and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good horror story."
4,kodak easyshare z7590 5mp,"Fairly easy to use, with the prompts on the screen. Can still be a bit confusing, however, considering the number of settings, etc... I will admit, however, that the number of settings was a plus when trying to decide what to buy. Does take some beautiful pictures!"
2,Service and manual not good,"I would not recommend this camera or the printing dock that comes with it. Several issues. It shipped to me directly from Kodak with a bad SD mamoery card and that has been a hassle to get Kodak to replace it, several phone calls, e-mails-some of which they don't respond to, and still no replacement a month later. Further the manual is not well written for instructions on fine tuning the camera. The printer dock manual never specifies which photo paper is needed, more phone calls. It takes 4x6 photos but the paper needs to have tabs at each end to work in the printer, and it does not work with standard 4x6 photo paper. The customer support phone number conncets you to somewhere overseas(I believe) and is less than helpful. I have owned or used extensively two cannon digital cameras, a Fuji digital, and a Nikon digital all of which have been better to deal with."
1,Don't buy this,"I have the immediate predecessor of this camera, the DX 6490. The autofocus stopped working during warranty and just after. The company wants $175 to fix what is now a 250 camera only two years old (cost me $600). Junk!"
5,Thrilled,"I am thrilled with my new camera. I am still learning some of the more complex features, but I was very quickly able to pick it up an use it. A lot of it is almost intuitive. Probably the biggest plus in my opinion is the ease of control. The various buttons, joy stick, toggles, etc. are very easy to reach and to operate. Even early on I can remember which button does what and I haven't made too many mistakes. It is great."
3,Its good but.....,"I think that the camera is good but it has flaws. Like in video mode you cannot zoom in or out while recording. You have to stop recording and adjust then start again. It takes good pictures, but for the same quality you can get a sleek smaller camera, it is really bulky and akward. If you want a good quality camera that is versitile this is not the camera. It is a great beginner type but you will want to up grade as soon as you can!"
4,great pictures!!!,"This is a great camera that takes beautiful pictures. I first bought another digital camera that takes 8.0 mp, but it didn't take great action pics. Returned it and bought this one instead! No regrets whatsoever!!! I love the zoom and the lens... pics almost look as if i took pics from my old 35mm camera."
3,Advanced amateurs? Don't bother.,"I bought this camera for my wife and poked around with it over the weekend. It has good enough picture quality for the price. Nice build, big LCD screen... A couple of things bug me, though. In manual modes, the camera is still controlling the way you take the picture. In aperture priority mode the lowest shutter speed is 1/8. It tells you to pop the flash, and if you don't, just takes underexposed picture. Also, fill flash mode doesn't work like it should - you can't slow sync the flash, it will just set the shutter speed to 1/60 no matter what. Still, you can get around with full-manual and shutter-priority modes. Even though it will disrupt your established workflow."
4,great motivation,"The book is great inspiration for people who work with kids or if you are wanting to motivate people who work in children's ministry, this would make a great gift."
5,Fantastic bird feeder,"This bird feeder is exactly as described. It's well built. Easy to install. And holds lots of bird seed. What it doesn't tell you is although we've had an unusual amount of wind and rain, the seed remains dry. What a fantastic bonus!I would highly recommend this bird feeder to all the bird lovers out there!!!!"
5,best bird feeder out there,1 of: Nature Products 431 Green Classic Pole Mount Wild Bird FeederWe had this feeder for 35 years and it finally couldn't take another NH winter. This is easy to fill and it keeps the squirrels out. I searched high and low and was happy to find it on amazon. If you have only one feeder- this is the one to own.
5,Third feeder in 25 years,"Our first NAPRO bird feeder served us and the birds -- but not the squirrels -- for almost 15 years. It was finally done in by the same storm that tore the roof off our barn. We bought a second NAPRO feeder immediately and it lasted over 12 years until a black bear bent the pole and pulled it down. Although it was battered and several of the metal feeding openings were bent, it was still useable, so we bought a new pole and put it up again. Unfortunately, the second pole was too short. A week ago a much larger than average raccoon pulled it down and finished the job the bear had started. This will be our third NAPRO feeder in about 25 years. We will keep buying them as long as NAPRO keeps making them -- they are that good."
3,birdfeeder review,"I was excited to receive this bird feeder because it appeared very efficient in design. It is just as pictured and is very well constructed; however, the birds don't really seem to like it as they go to my other feeders much more readily. Not displeased with it but wouldn't purchase it again. Will try another type of seed in it to see it 'visitation' improves."
1,Definitely not squirrel-proof,For the first week seemed to resist squirrels but then they learned to climb the post and cast off the lid. I even caught one squirrel inside the feeder feasting away after removing the lid. Then tried greasing the post with petroleum jelly as one reviewer suggested but that was totally ineffective. The next step was drilling some holes at the top of the feeder to secure the lid with plastic wire ties. That must have frustrated the critters enough to do the damage shown in my photos.
4,The best bird feeder I have owned,"I have some very determined squirrels and rats that live in our yard. This is the only feeder that has consistently defeated them. They climb the pole and bite at the baffle but are unable to do anything else, drop off and wander away dejected. It is also rainproof so there is no gross mold or seedlings that have to be cleaned out.It is a hit with the birds, even scrub jays try to bend down to get at the holes.The only negative is that the birds tend to throw the seed out onto the ground because there are no catchment dishes (if there was it wouldn't be as rainproof I guess) but I changed from millet to sunflower seeds and it seems less of an issue.Now the squirrels sit under it, rather than raiding it."
5,So far so good,"After having squirrels defeat several other feeders - decided to try this one. Closest I've seen after 2 months is a bushy tail sticking out from under the baffel - they have left for easier pickings. You do have to check the feeding holes peridoically - seed hulls tend to get wet from driving rain, and turn into little bricks"
5,A wonderful story and a history lesson at the same time.,I loved this novel and all the historical facts are like icing on the cake. I can't wait to walk on the Santa Fe Trail and I'll keep my fingers crossed that I just might see a ghost.
3,May the Farm Be With You,"I wonder whether this was inspired by Store Wars - definitely worth a watch. Darth Tater makes an appearance - but he's like the Mr. Pototo Head I had when I was a kid (a long, long time ago in a state far away) - he's made of a real potato. http://www.storewars.org/flash/=W="
4,Tater Tot.....I Am Your Father!!!!!,"This toy caught my eye and I, the parent, had to buy it. Yes, I am guilty. It is limited in parts, but so is the regular ""potato head"" when you buy it. It is priced about the same, so you choose. It turned out to be a good thing for me because I have 2 kids and had only 1 ""potato head"" at home. We already have a silly suitcase loaded with parts. It was win win for us. We now ""have it all"". I would like to suggest to the toy makers to make a deluxe Star Wars potato head. Ideally it would come with Leia's hairbuns, Yoda's ears, a stormtrooper helmet, Jar Jar ears, etc. (You get the picture)"
3,Can't get enough of the Spud,"I purchased this for my ""Star Wars"" loving son in law. Given that he is 35, I wasn't worried about its educational value, just it whimsy quotient. Mr. Potato Head is a family favorite and this one is cute."
2,What's with all of the 5 star reviews?,"Yeah, it's cool, excellent idea, cute, but...THE FRIGGIN PIECES WON'T STAY IN!!! the limbs will NOT stay in at all, no fiction."
3,Darth Tater,The back of it was not fitted correctly and it would not stay on regardless of the age of the person trying to make it say on
2,Morality Check,"I find it very disturbing to see a toy made satirizing an intergalactic mass murderer and war criminal who held the entire galaxy under the boot of the evil Empire. Prior to his redemption as Anakin Skywalker, Vader indiscriminately committed torture, oversaw the destruction of an entire planet and murdered officers under his command. What kind of message are we sending to children by making a toy celebrating this man's misdeeds? What's next - Adolf Eichmann, Pol Pot and Joseph Stalin Potato Heads?"
5,Darth Tator is a fun gift to wrap up the series,I purchased this as fun gift. It turned out even better than I expected.
3,Maybe A Good Toy.,"I am the Star Wars FanaticI have only played with this toy once then I sort of wanted to return it. Not that bad but sort of. I heard from a friend it is fun but its not. I still can't believe I got it. But, if you're like 4-6 get it. You can rearange the Potato Head figure and mess around with it. Mr. Potato Head Darth Tater???? Well, maybe you can have fun with it if you're a toddler or in pre-school but not if you don't like Mr. Potato Head anymore (like me)."
5,I taterly love this toy,my teacher brought this in to school and he isnt even a star wars fan. when i saw it and read the darth tater name i thought it was hilarious and got one myself and i hate starwars i just love darth tater tho
4,Not Just for Kids,Mr. P as the dark lord is just too cute. He is a must have for Star Wars fans of all ages. I bought one for myself and one for my husband. My kids are so jealous.
4,excellent adaptation of the great villan,very considerate products for the star wars fans. i can't think of a better compliment.
4,Give in to the Warped Side of the Force!,This is in the top 10 of the all-time great pop culture icon parodies! No more need be said.
4,Darth Tater and Mr Potato,"2 1/2 year old grand son enjoys playing with it. He also has the original style Mr Potato Head and discovered parts are interchangable. I had to glue feet on original as they were continually falling off and had the same problem with ""Darth"", glued his feet on and now no problems."
5,Darth Tater Review,"Darth Tater is lots of fun. While he can be the evil Darth Tater, he can also be mild mannered Mr. Potato Head. We love him very much."
5,Can't help but smile,"As a kid I loved using Mr. Potato head and bought this as a gift, but may keep it as it makes me smile when I see it sitting on my counter."
5,Smiles!,"Darth Tater helped me make a special girl smile, which was the end goal! So, it definitely did it's job. She is enjoying it very much. Thank you so much for the ability to create smiles and happiness in others!!"
5,Great concersational piece,Everyone at work asks me about the new addition to my office. Great for kids and kids at heart.
4,Fun toy for a star wars fan of any age,"There are 2 types of people that this toy will be perfect for. 1) Kids who like Star Wars, and 2) older kids who like Star Wars. I fall into the latter. The parts are pretty durable, they are kind of difficult to put into the potato. The best partt he fun factor of this toy. Its just plain funny/weird to see Vader crossed with Potato Head. This is a fun toy for those who will appreciate it."
4,The tator is well done,I bought this guy for my nephew (just turned 4). This is a fun toy and one neat cross over into the Star Wars universe. I know my nephew will have fun with his Darth Tater. May the spuds be with us all!
4,Starwars Potato-Head,"First appearance this toy is super funny. Who thought of making a potato head into darth tator? It's a very creative idea and that's why we bought two. One is to play with and the other is save as memorabilia. Our son loves it and plays with it quite often. As for educational purposes, he's five so this toy is not a large source of knowledge for him, but I can see it being very educational for a 2 - 3 year old."
5,"""May the Fries be with You""",Excellent idea to brighten up the office of any 30 to 40 year old who remembers playing with this toy as a child. Even angry colleagues coming into to my office can't help laughing at his Vader helmet and sticking out tongue. Great for breaking the ice and having a laugh. I tell people you can tell my mood for the day by the face I put on him in the morning. May be worth a bit 20 years from now as well so I bought 3 of them.
4,Stabilizer is a must for all pools,"I've not tried this particular brand of Pool Stabilizer, but had a pool most of my life and was a lifeguard for many years. The use of Stabilizer is one of the most important chemicals for your pools maintenance. It will quickly pay for itself, since you will use far less chlorine. It ""stabilizes"" the water, by lessening the effects of the sun lower in the chlorine content.To apply this product, you should pour it in a ""leaf net"" and slowly try and dissolve it into the water. You NEVER POUR IT DIRECTLY INTO YOUR POOL. You can also try pouring smaller amounts directly into your skimmers. It will still settle on the bottom, so you'll have to vacuum it up, but that will allow it to better dissolve into the water.Many people don't add stabilizer and spend to much on Chlorine and always have the chlorine then either too high or too low. I'll save the virtues of a proper PH and Quality Test Kit for another review.Best of luck to all."
2,"don,t waste your money on this",i bought the chlorine stabilizer for my pool and i poured it in my pool and and it sunk to the bottom insead of dissolving in the pool i wish i never would of bought it
5,Rush to your book store!!!!,"Once I started reading this book, putting it down was impossible. Dick Waterman's stories about the various blues musicians were as impressive as the outstanding photos in the book. It felt like I was pulled inside this incredible book and for a moment felt like I personally knew and was living with these people. The believability of this book was truly enhanced by Dick Waterman's honesty. He truly says it as it is. This book is not only interesting for blues officianados, but also for anyone interested in American history, great photography and captivating stories."
5,Da Blues,"As well as other types of photography, musicians have been part of my life since 1966. I've done photography for everybody from the Beatles, Janis Joplin, Chuck Berry, Peter, paul & Mary and others and to capture visually a true image of them is very difficult so when a photograph you've done of them IS truly them.""Between Midnight and Day"" is a wonderful look o the inside of legendary Blues musicians."
4,"Self-awareness is the key to self-control, and Thayer gives you the knowledge to gain self-awareness","Great book to get a scientific overview of the basis of moods and how moods influence behavior, especially in regards to eating and exercise. It does contain some self-help advice, but most of the book is about distilling knowledge based on scientific research. The assumption is that this knowledge will help people become AWARE of their moods and how they affect their behavior, and that this awareness in turn is the best basis for regulating oneself (in this case regarding especially eating and exercise). The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is on style, because in certain parts of the book the author can be a tad repetitive."
4,Excellent explination of hunger & stress,Will enlighten you on the balance of hunger and stressors in alignment with hormones and other body chemical processes. Fasinating & helpful to one's own nourishment and lifestyle.
1,Don't Buy,"DVD was outdated, did not meet my need for students, only talked about floor nursing and did not explore other nursing positions."
4,Careers in NUrsing,"A bit hokey and old fashioned, but a hoot for those who went through nursing education in times past. Great new condition and arrived timely."
3,A Nice Romance Story,"Someone gave me this book to read and I wasn't too particular in reading it because I thought the book was about the couple on the front cover -- and since I don't know them or know of them, I felt like I didn't want to read about average people who have gone through things in life just like I have and everybody else. Unless the couple was a celebrity, I wasn't interested in reading about their lives but I was wrong. It ended up being a cute romance novel on celibacy.I guess being celibate is a popular subject these days. The talk used to be ""safe sex"" or ""wrap it up,"" but now I'm reading about these authors who writes about ""save sex for marriage,"" like in this other novel I read called Lust of the Flesh (which, by the way, is an excellent novel)."
3,OK,"Amani has made a vow to God to remain a virgin until she marries, but that's a hard vow to keep when she starts dating handsome basketball player Marley. Marley is also a christan, and also find it hard to remain pure until marriage. I was rooting for the couple to remain virgins doing the whole book. It was a different look with the female initiating the first sexual move. I liked the book, but felt that it was missing something, at times the story was boring for me."
5,You gotta read it!,"This is a wonderful story of love on so many different levels. First Love is a must read for EVERY young person out there, who's searching for...whatever. Themselves or someone else. This is a great thought and discussion tool for youth groups, and adults, too, in that case! The issues present in this story are universal, regardless of age, race, socio-economic status, religion, etc. In fact, parents, it's a great book to read WITH your children. I'm so glad someone has written engaging, sensible, throught-provoking, enlightening, emotional, realistic text that focuses on what love is really about. GOD. Thank you, Yolanda!"
4,I Wish I would have waited,"I feel that this book is a good example for youth growing up in the 2000's. They need examples of those who are faced with same challenges as they are. This book will help them to see that somepeople are stronger than the will of the body. Some people do fear God and believe what he says in his word and some people want to do the right thing. Good work Yolanda, I should have read this book when I was younger, I believe the example would have helped me to make some different decisions. This is a great bookfor those who want to date and live a Godly life."
5,Modern Love of God,"Ms. Callegari truly moved me in her novel. Her character, Amani Shepard was the classic example of a damsel in serious stress, with and urban twist. Amani has to choose between her true love in the natural and her spritual love for God. Although she faces some moments of temptation she knows who she must obey, her heart. Yolanda did an excellent job of keeping up with the times and making the novel welcoming to young and old. I would definitely suggest that any and every young teenage girl, especially ones that are in love, to read this novel."
2,Too long and too preachy,"Let me start by saying that I am a Christian woman who received Christ at the tender age of 12. I kept my virginity until I was 23 years old and married. I agree with this author that it is the right thing to do. However, I found this novel to be way too preachy to get that message through to the youth of today. The scriptures, quoted lyric to gospel songs and such were overwhelming...even for me. It was hard to complete the read because all the mini-sermons kept weighing down the message behind the love story. I never completed the entire novel because it just seemed to go on forever. The story was over well before the book ended in my opinion. The message that this author was aiming to get across was a good one and one that needs to be spread. However her means of spreading the message is ineffective on a large scale."
3,Nice Idea needs modification,This style clip for the 8260 is really the only clip that Nokia themselves make. The clip needs to have the ablility to clip better and grip. I found that while it stays on the belt you have to be carefull not to let the phone drop.
2,Not designed for other than hooking onto a stationary object,"The ""hinge"" of the clip is too low on the phone to allow one to clip it into a pocket, purse, etc. without the risk of falling out (i.e., the top of the phone becomes too exposed). I have an Ericsson phone that has a hinge closer to the top of the phone that worked perfectly. This one doesn't. I agree with everyone else that the clip is too short for a belt. That leaves as the only practical use to hook it onto a stationary object - such as the mobile phone holder in the car. I use the holder that I used with my Ericsson phone and it works well."
3,Tries to be too advanced for a Dummies book.,"I noticed the other reviews agree with me; absolute beginners hate this book, but professional programmers find it helpful. The author seems intent on describing ""real"" applications, but wants to keep the book brief; around the size you'd expect a Dummies book to be. As a result, the author has to be too brief when explaining Java basics; hence the bad reviews given by beginning programmers. However, if you're a professional programmer the brief explanations are enough to get you going, and the ""real"" programs are much more illuminating then what is usually seen in programming books. Personally, I would have written two Dummies books; one for the absolute beginner, and a second book for graduates of that book and more advanced programmers (kind of like the Core Java books)."
1,Not helpful for beginners,"I am pretty insulted that I bought a ""Dummies"" book, and had trouble following it. I got to chapter 5 and quit reading. This book starts off stepping through code examples, glossing over concepts such as methods, classes, and constructers, and then doesn't explain these concepts in detail until later chapters. It seems that the chapters could have been arranged better. I don't recommend this book to beginner Java programmers."
2,Huh? Did we see the same flick?,"I am sitting here reading reviews of this movie and I see words like ""fright"", ""scary"", etc. What? If this is scary, then ""Beaches"" is a hardcore snuff film. This movie is totally not scary. It's about Korean high school girls and that's it. Yeah, one girl offs herself, and the others sit around and discuss her. It's weak. No nothing. If you think this is scary, I bet you are deadbolting your doors after a good healthy dose of Barney or Dragon Tales. Watch Ju-On if you want scary. If you want Korean scary, watch Bloody Beach or Scissors. This is the weakest link."
2,Somewhat useful if you can stomach it,"This book is essentially split in two. The first half is older and written by David, the second half is newer and written by Peter. I liked the sections written by David, but he was often a bit vague in explaining things. There was a lot of what and not a lot of why. Peter on the other hand goes into great lengths to explain the minutia of his naming conventions. Where David lacks, Peter is superfluous. Often the two differ in opinion as well. Neither of them really get it right and I am left with questions and wishing I had a better book on scything. Additionally the parts written by Peter are filled with disdain for anyone other than him and his elite little home schooled family. The book drips with narcissism to the point where towards the end I became disgusted with it. Two stars for being the ONLY scythe book. If you can, find someone to teach you instead of slogging through this mess."
3,Better than nothing,"In that this seems to be the only available book on scythes you could say it is the best book on scythes. The author drifts into New Age gibberish twice but then only for a moment. The rest of the info seems to be good; and this is certainly a great beginer's book. My complaint is that it does not go beyond a beginer's book. The book will help you get started, but if you buy a scythe you really should find some old hand at scythes to further your education."
1,Unused Brad nails,"Wrong quanity sent. (1000 vs 5000). Very quick replacement was also only 1000 nails. Returned both items to Amazon for refund. After 4 emails and many weeks, still no refund. Product may be ok, but Amazon has a problem in correcting this miss-labeled item."
5,Fun for Christmas and beyond,My nine year old grandson was singing along to this Christmas CD long afterthe holiday season.. His mom finally had to put it away until nextyear or it would have been Christmas all year long at their house!
5,Great product--not so great shipping,"The Wedgewood place setting was fine. However, the shipping material was not adequate to eliminate breakage. Amazon responded quickly and efectively to rectify the situation."
3,Good maps,"For my week in Hong Kong, I used Frommer's guide as my main guide, but took this as a secondary guide because of its maps. It has very good local area maps for the neighborhoods it covers, showing sights, hotels, restaurants, and shops. I found it most useful for locating shops and sights.Unlike the other HK guides I looked at, this one includes the written Chinese names of the places it covers. This could be useful if you need to give a taxi driver written destinations.The book's coverage is very limited. I would not recommend it as your only guidebook. I found it worth it for the maps, but it's a bit expensive just for that."
2,There are better books,"I bought this to have a small book with decent information to take with me when I was out and about. While this book has some nice information on places to visit, it lacks information on how to actually get there. So you see somewhere you want to go but you're stuck trying to figure out exactly where it is and how to get there. The maps are very mediocre. The pullout map that came with it is useless. I definitely wouldn't buy this one again."
4,Finally a well designed book on web design for designers!,"This is a professional book, written for an audience with some visual sophistication and understanding of design. Unlike many of the how-to books on web site design, this one does not assume you were born yesterday and need to know how to get cool quick. McKelvey has written (and designed) a well thought out presentation on designing for the web today, broadly and effectively covering the major issues we all face: site structure, page layout, type, and color. The text is brief and clear, the examples are well chosen and beautifully presented. Form follows function, each book page makes sense. The analysis of how pages and web sites are put together is insightful, his examples well chosen. Only the title of the book is a puzzle, an attempt to coin a new term? When I think of ""hypergraphics"" I think of obnoxious animated GIFs, not the web sites McKelvery has chosen to explain."
2,NOT SO GREAT,I read the reviews for this book and thought I was getting my dollar's worth. I was mistaken. This was the first book I studied and I found several gramatical errors and I didn't find the strategy helpful at all. I thought I was doing great until I picked up the Kaplan book and realized that this test was going to be a challenge. Anyone who uses this book as their main source of studying is in for a rude awakening.
3,Barely enough to hone your GMAT skills,"Princeton prepares well for beginners who wants to familiarise themselves with the GMAT. But, it is not thorough enough to cover all types of contexts to score a high GMAT score.As for the CD-ROM, although there are many questions to practice, the format of the practice test does not come close to the real thing, which makes it quite ineffective.When sitting for the real test, I was panicking because the questions formats were different especially in the Verbal part. Consequently I did not do well, and am planning to redo it!"
3,Good insights - but a bit simplistic,"As part of my recent preparation for the GMAT exam, I purchased four study guides - The Princeton Review, Kaplan, Barrons and ETS's Official Guide - along with their associated CDROMs. Out of the four that I purchased, the Kaplan book was by far the best. It had a well-structured approach and a set of diverse and challenging practice questions (especially the practice CATs on the CDROM).However, the Princeton Review also had a number of redeeming features. It had some good pointers on ""thinking like a GMAT examiner"", it was chatty, informal and therefore easy to read, and its formula approach to the Analytical Writing Assessment section was very helpful. The downside was that it over-simplified the approach to some GMAT question formats and therefore missed some of the subtleties of the GMAT test. If you only going to buy one GMAT study guide, I'd strongly recommend Kaplan. If you buy two, then this is the natural second choice."
3,Questions are too easy,"The test taking strategies and presentation of the material is excellent, with point form summaries for each chapter. I found the points in Kaplan scattered and burried between excercises -- harder to summarize the main points into a list for quick review.The questions, however, are way too easy. The Kaplan book does have questions similar to the level of the GMAT.I would personally buy this book to learn the concepts, Kaplan for the questions. This combination worked best for me."
2,Questions too easy,These questions are too easy. Don't kid yourself if you score high on a princeton review practice test. Kaplan has more difficult questions that are comparable to ETS.
2,The CDROM software is Hopeless,I bought this book 2 days back. The software is irritating and hopeless. I am a software engineer and even then I am finding it very irritating. People with no or little computer background will have a tough time using the software.
3,problems in the software provided by the book,"The book in general is ok, but there are several serious problems with the software provided:1) It has bugs in the evaluation of the exams section: it's easy for you to spend 1.5 hours solving an exam and then get no results for it. It's very depressing.2) The software is obviously developed by some amateurs due to it's extremely non-user friendly interface and unclear buttons meaning."
1,"If I could, I would have given this book a 0 star rating","MBA aspirants avoid this book , waste of time and money.Instead, I would highly recommend getting ETS guide and Kaplan with CD book.They both are good books.Additional to these if u have time and need some more books to buy I would say get Barrons,Peterson or Arcos, they are pretty decent"
3,Good but not THAT helpful !,"I thought this would be a good book, considering its from the Princetion Review and everything but, it was just about OK.The book does not offer any real full length tests and is not as systematic in its approach as the Kaplan book.Buy it if u must for the CD !"
4,A fairly good book,"This is one of the many books I used and this is one of the two books that helped me most. The other book was the Official GMAT guide. I did not use Kaplan. The tests on the CD are a fair represenatation of what one can expect in the real GMAT. The maths sections are bit easy as compared to what one can get in the GMAT but verbal sections are pretty close to the real GMAT. On the three simulated tests I scored 710,670 and 730. My score in the real GMAT was 750. My scores in verbal and quant. sections in the simulated tests were very close to my real GMAT scores, between 45 to 49. On the flip side, the book is very verbose. I didn't pay much attention to the tricks and strategies discussed in the book but the section on reading comprehension is definitely worth a look."
2,Get Kaplan & ETS books,"Although some part of verbal & math section in the book is quite helpful, the GMAT test from the CD is too easy, doesn't reflect a real question in the test.Get Kaplan & ETS test-prep materials, allow 2-3 months for intense study, you will get a good results. Score above 650 is not impossible, if you study hard from this two books."
2,Beware of Quality Control Problems,"I own 2 of these.The first I bought used and it sounds and plays wonderfully.Given that it is a short scale bass, I decided to buy a second Allen Woody to have as a back-up. I ordered one from an online dealer. The bass arrived and it had no output jack, just a cavity where you would normally plug in the bass. A replacement was sent. On this one the pickups did not work. The dealer had me take it to an Epiphone approved repair outlet. They got the pickups to work but the tone control control was either treble full on or bass full on. Back to the repair outlet where they could not remedy the problem with the tone control after 2 visits. Eventually, the dealer gave me a partial refund on the bass to offset the defective tone control.I would not recommend buying an Epiphone online. You have to play the unit you buy to make sure everything functions. If it does, you will have a bass you are happy with."
4,awesome,"love the dudesons. i remember watching them on spike tv all the time. movie is great, you can get it on google video or whatever, but definitly worth getting it for the commentary and the extra features."
4,Different,"The equivalent of Jackass 2.5 in my opinion. Funny stunts, great footage, and hilarious. But there is just as much interviewing as there are stunts. Regardless, BUY IT NOW!!!"
4,"""Pain is momentary, film is forever.""","These guys are CRAZY!!! Jackass has nothing on these guys. I have always been a big fan of jackass, viva la bam, and the wildboyz so I had to give these guys a try. They are so insane, you cant help but watch these guys do extreme stunts that just dont compare to anything that you have ever seen. They have been friends since childhood and do crazy stunts together. These guys were ever before jackass, so they are the real jackasses. if you love jackass and all those other shows that are similar and want to add to your collection, this is a must."
1,Made my skin worse!,"I couldn't believe when I read the other reviews about this product. Had to try it myself. So I figured if it had a 30 day money back guarantee I would try it. It not only did not work, but it made my skin so much worse. I was getting huge cyst like pimples and I never had that. I thought maybe I just needed to get used to it and that your skin always gets worse before it gets better. Not the case with this product. I stopped using it and my skin cleared up or should I say went back to normal. I did not want to leave a bad product review without contacting the manufacturer first. Unbelievable! Money Back guarantee my A**!!!!! They sent me an email stating that since I already used the product they cannot refund me. HUH? don't you have to try it to see if it works for you?????? WTF!!!! Anyway, needless to say I'm not happy. I should have listened to the reviews. These are really helpful. Heed my warning...do not deal with Murad! or at least the company that is selling it."
1,Save your skin and don't waste your money,"I read all the reviews on this product after seeing the infomercial on TV. Being an optimist, I decided to try the acne complex despite the fact that some buyers were pleased with its results and others were extremely disappointed. I am in my mid-twenties and have had moderate acne since I was 13. I have tried every over-the-counter product around. For me, Murad worked well for the first week. My skin was completely clear and very smooth. Then I started getting large, painful cysts that took a long time to heal. I stuck with the complex for 5 more weeks (through the ""purging"" phase) but things did not get better and I gave up on it. Now I am back with Proactive, which is not 100% effective but at least doesn't make my skin worse."
5,Excellent value,I bought this on sale here at Amazon for $15! An amazing price on an amazing set of products. They do work and are gentle on your skin. They are perfect for even sensitive skin. My daughter who is 12 uses many Murad products and never has any adverse reactions. She has very sensitive skin and none of the Murad products have ever caused any reactions. Highly recommend this product and all Murad products in general.
2,"Didn't work for me, but maybe for you.","I can't really remember what this product did for me because I took it a while ago, but all I know is it didn't work. However, we are all different so maybe it might work for you."
2,my opinion on product description,"It would be helpful to include the expiration date for these items. Furthermore, this package looks like a partial starter kit, which actually sells directly from Murad for $29.95: is it REALLY a $60 value/list price? Murad's 60-day supply, which sells for $59.90 contains much larger size products; a 4.5 oz cleanser, for example, and not a 2 oz one. My opinion is that this is a very straight-forward description of the product in question. FYI, I did not purchase any products from this user, I'm simply posting my opinion after shopping around for the best value for Murad products."
5,Awesome Fun,"I got this for my 40th birthday. It is so fun. The hit of our fourth of July Celebration! I actually had people come and personally thank me for making their ice cream!!!!! We just chopped up lots of M&Ms, butterfingers, and Reese's Peanut butter cups tooo. But the brownies in choc and vanilla stole the show!!! Great fun for the kids too!"
1,Corrosion on one of the spades,"On opening, I discovered that one of the spades I received has substantial metal corrosion on the handle and the chrome-type finish is flaking in places. Avoid."
4,A great bad idea!,"We really love this product, but the spades do take a bit of getting used to. No quite as easy as a scoop. Of course now we buy more candy, so we can put it in our ice cream. Plus the kids want both every night now! But a great product that does just what we wanted it too!!"
2,outdoor fireplace review,"The quality of the interior grate is very poor. We had 3 fires in the fireplace and the interior grate rusted through (from rain) and broke into pieces. The first time we put the top cover on, the cover turned white hot and started to melt. Other than those items, the basin itself is nice to have a fire in."
3,Needs protection from rain.,"Product works great on patio, but it needs protection from rain.It quickly filled with water and was difficult to empty. The rain will soon rust all parts if there is no way to keep rain out or to let it drain."
3,weak follow up effort,"i really liked chilled ibiza 1 & 2, so i was expecting a lot from this collection. unfortunately, it wasn't anywhere near as good as the first two in the series. it seemed to have a completely different feel to it than chilled ibiza 1 & 2. overall, this was a big let down and i wouldn't recommend this to fans of the series or anyone i guess."
4,An exercise in the psychology of human relationships,"The Nestucca Retreat explores the complex relationships of a married couple who have lived their lives vicariously through a friend. The struggle to carry on without him was very real.There are a myriad of characters that share their experiences of life with and without J.Cunningham Raleigh. The surprise guest really throws a wonderful spin on the plot. I had the privilege of growing up with the author in a small Texas town and the time period, the places and some of the characters are very real! This is a well-written book. The pace is steady and kept my interest. I did see the ending coming several chapters beforehand and I didn't want it to end that way. I thought Jake's sister and her husband were two characters that the book didn't need as there were enough people to keep track of as it were. I strongly recommend this bok for anyone that survived the 60's."
1,Bad Description,"The product is fine, the problem is the feature description does not match what the product is. I was mislead because of product description. It is NOT used to connect to anything, except to sync the cell-phone's phonebook. Also, the product does not work with ALL Ericcson phones as described in the features."
2,Objectionable book title,"A brave endeavor to tackle a challenging subject. At the same time, however, the book title threatens to discredit both the author and the subject by pathologizing sex (i.e. as ""sleaze"" and ""disease"") while reinscribing the Orient (i.e. Japan in this specific instance) as the locus of (sexual) ""disease."" We all know that controversial sexual practices and underground adult industries are not specific to Japanese society. Then again, this book can be read as an ironic cautionary tale for the voyeuristic Japanophile who hopes to get laid in Japan."
1,A book about sleaze that ens up being sleaze itself.,"This publication is a series of clippings from books, magazines and newspapers on Japan's criminal underworld. It contains a mindbogling 1186 end-notes and little, if any, original ideas. Unless you enjoy reading a hundred cases of schoolgirls selling their dirty panties, don't waste your time reading this sleaze."
1,You are a one racisit mafo,"Dr. Hayes,If you hate Japan and Japanese culture so much, who forced you to live in Japan? I am sure you are as bitter about Jews, Blacks and many other groups. In summary, you are one bigot and racist dude. You should not be allowed to teach in any schools and forget about the tenure."
1,Bad Book,"If you don't like Japan, stop being on a Japanese payroll and go back to your potato farm. Sick of these Japan bashing books; if you have anything reasonable to say about my country, rant in Japanese. Ichigaya high sucks but you can't leave your paycheck; you're a real big man."
1,Ineffective as pet deterrent,"I bought this to deter my cat from jumping on my dining room table. No matter where I put the device on the table or how I set it, the cat only set it off if he knocked the device over. I tried with and without a tablecloth. It worked slightly better with the tablecloth off, but my table looks terrible without a cloth and the better performance may have just been because it tipped over easier when the table was bare."
4,It worked for our dogs!,"I bought 2 and within 2 weeks my dogs were trained not to jump on our bed and sofa even after removing the device. I don't think it would work well for cats because cats are much more graceful than dogs and make less of a vibration when landing on a surface. We have a 9 pound dog and a 45 pound dog and it works for both. Dogs forget, so every so often we have to place the Tattle Tale back on the bed and sofa as a reminder. The only drawback is that it's loud, so be careful around sleeping babies! All in all, a good buy for the money. It's so nice to not have to reprimand your dogs, but just have a device do the work for you!"
5,Elizabeth and After,"Though Elizabeth and After has a gently-propelled plot and wonderful characterizations, what makes this novel so unique and special, for me, is the crisp and fresh writing. There's nothing labored or falsely ""poetic"" in the prose. Everything works and this is altogether unusual in contemporary American/Canadian fiction. For this reason, I consider this to be the best novel I've read this year. David Unger"
3,an interesting story,a beautifully written story with interesting twists along the way. Slow paced but worth the read.
2,over-rated!,"I was very disappointed with this book. I can understand people liking it but I cannot see why anyone would think it a great novel. The best thing about it is the writing. It is a well-written book. The plot is somewhat mechanistic. The characterization is also frustrating; the good people tend to be passive and the bad ones tend to be totally bad with no redeeming features to create a sense of well-roundedness. Finally the moral vision is somewhat bleak with so much sinister corruption in the town. If this is what small town Ontario is like, no wonder we have situations like the tragedy in Walkerton.This novel bears no comparison with a novel like No Great Mischief by Alstair Maclean, which is just in another league altogether."
4,Good one,"Von Däniken has an interesting theory about the ancient gods. It is a theory worth reading and thinking about. No one knows what the true is; maybe the Bible is right, maybe von Däniken, maybe....."
1,God weren't astronauts,"I read this trash-book here in Brazil.This book is so bad, that I didn't finished it.This book is absurd, ridiculous and senseless.Please, don't waste your money and time, reading this trash-book."
5,Wipeout will keep you coming back for more,"The speed, the ships, the courses are superb. This title continues to set the level against which all race games are measured. There is more than just racing to this. Unlock the zone and you will never be able to leave, trying to get to the next zone. There is no limit to the number of zones.Enjoy the feeling of seeing your oponent disappear through the force of a quake. Use your air brakes to make the jump and take you round the corners of the corkscrew. Addictive as hell, not to be missed."
2,Bam....... Uh.... What happened?,"Im a fan of the Wipeout series, not a big fan but just a fan. I do like the thrill the series gives with super fast hovercrafts and the blazing techno soundtrack that is accompanied in the game. But this one just doesn't do it for me. I mean all you will notice is improved graphics which isn't really impressive, better and bigger environments but that is about it. No replay value to it. Of course you can play with a friend head to head but that's not much fun after a while. You'll also notice that the controls are alot and I mean ALOT stiffer than the previous wipeout games. The controls can get a little frustrating at times especially when you get to the higher levels of speed.I say give this one a rental. I don't think it's worthy of a buy for your PS2 collection in my opinion. Such a disappointment but oh well. Oh and one more thing. THe soundtrack for the game is a little old and outdated for me."
1,Wipeout Fusion,"hi everyone,Wipeout Fusion is here out in Europe, so I decided to give it a try... If your looking for the 'original' wipeout feel, like wipeout 2097, wipeout 3 or wipeout 64 DON'T buy this game. The only thing related between wipeout fusion and the wipeouts described above is you are flying a ship which can fire weapons.Sensitivity has changed, weapons is not as good, music [is not good]!Now don't get me wrong, I love wipeout 2097 & wipeout 3... I would rate them 5 stars..."
5,My favorite racing game - best in the Wipeout series,"Upgradeable anti-grav units. Easy to handle controls. Ample unlockables that actually add replay value. And yes, I love the music. I can't say enough good things about the Wipeout series, and Wipeout Fusion continues the fun ride that began back on the PSX. This remains my favorite racing game of all time, and one of the reasons why I really don't need a PS3."
1,Wipeout Fusion,"hi everyone,Wipeout Fusion is here out in Europe, so I decided to give it a try... If your looking for the 'original' wipeout feel, like wipeout 2097, wipeout 3 or wipeout 64 DON'T buy this game. The only thing related between wipeout fusion and the wipeouts described above is you are flying a ship which can fire weapons.Sensitivity has changed, weapons is not as good, music ain't great!Now don't get me wrong, I love wipeout 2097 & wipeout 3... I would rate them 5 stars..."
1,Wipeout Disappointment would be a better title,"I've been a huge fan of the wipeout series from day one (I even liked Wipeout 3, despite its many faults) and I must say that I am very disappointed with the performance of this game....Huge load times, bad menu interface, & weak AI. Graphics, of course, are much sharper on PS2 that previous versions but despite this the game seems much much more sluggish than any of the PS1 games...I just doesn't have any ummph at all. This was easily the least fun game I've ever played on PS2. Looks good and goes nowhere."
2,Ultimately unsatisfying.,"If i wanted to play a PS1 game, I would have bought a PS1 game. The graphics of this game are aweful compared to the capabilities of the PS2. If my quest to find a F-zero successor I was surely disappointed. The gameplay and track design are actually solid but there are some nagging issues that I can't seem to get over. (I really tried hard and wanted to like this game) One issue that got the better of me was the fact that there was no count down at the beginning of each race.After 2 weeks I had to trade-it in for Extreme 3G (an awesome game), avoid wasting ur money on Wipeout Fusion and be certain to rent this title first.I suggest that you also give Extreme 3G a whirl, u will not be disappointed."
4,Pretty Good,"Worked fine, took a little tweaking to get the range of action right. All of the listed items were in the box. Hard to tell when the shock collar battery is running down. Need to replace it on a calendar."
2,Does not keep beagle in yard,"We bought this updated fence in hoping it would keep the beagle in the yard. It didnt work. He still runs right threw the fence. We know fence is ""hot"" as the light shows us the connection is good. We tried highest settings on everything we could and beagle still runs through it. He won't come back through it, but he has not issues running out of it.Anyone need a beagle?"
2,Very labor intensive to install,"Labor intensive to install - pvc pipe doubles the cost. And if you don't make a circle with the wiring you have to dig a double tranch to loop back around. The collar is horribly bluky. If we move, I will be choosing a different option."
3,instructional dvd?,"works well, but the ad says it comes with an instructional dvd, which was not included."
3,Very strong deterent,My dog is stubborn but this has stopped him from willingly going in the yard. I will have to work with him more to put his mind at ease so he will go out again.
4,"Roaming, jumping dog... our best solution.","We adopted a dog from the shelter. He is very sweet, but a roamer and jumper. Our Vet said he was a great dog but to keep him in the fence buy one of these and crank it all the way up. Beau yelped the first 2 times, but learned quick. He is staying within the boundaries we set (about 2 feet inside the fence). We feel a lot better now! We called the company to discuss installation. You do not need to bury the line. We have it along our fence, but buried it past gates. Only problem is that the neighbor's dog broke it with her nails. The unit gave a warning that it was broken (a complete loop has to be made). The pieces were easily spliced together. For the part across our deck we used staples and attached the wire at the top under the eaves. When Beau gets close to the wall he won't get shocked because it is further away from the 2-foot distance we set. This was the best solution for our situation. Now our sweet Beau stays at home."
4,Large dog,"Only works in large areas, doesn't work in confined spaces. Now all I have to do is make a zapping sound and my dog stops any riotous behavior. I can also put up a yellow wire anywhere and my pet would come anywhere near the wire."
3,good customer service,"Our in ground system lasted only 3 months due to a bad lightning storm. I fully expected to have to purchase a new one but when I called, the company replaced our system but highly recommended the lightning protection kit. Until the lightning, it worked well. We did not do a good job in training our dogs and due to our errors, they basically trained themselves. They are big puppies (85 and 105 lbs) and they stayed in the confined area 99% of the time and we had it set to the lowest setting. It was relatively easy to set up but not if digging the trench by hand. Rent a trench digging machine - it saves so much time. Also, one of our collars was chewed off within about 3 months as well and had to be replaced. The receiver is fine but the collar itself was too damaged for use."
2,Lifetime warranty it is not,"I have had this product for over 10 years now. When you buy this product it plainly states limited lifetime warrant but don't believe the sellsperson this isn't true. I spend an average of $75 a year to keep the transmitter working, doesn't take much lightening anywhere in neighborhood to ruin these things and petsafe charges to replace them. The lightening protecter they sell is a total waste of money as it only reduces the chance by very little the transmitter doesn't get a hit. I keep 2 transmitters because it never fails to go out 2 days before we go on vacation."
1,Radio Fence,"Spent 2 days installing unit. The wire is brittle and tiny, the instructions are poor, and it is very unstable. It took less than an hour for my 30 pound dog to destroy the flimsy web collar. I replaced the collar and the unit worked for about 1 day and totally quit. It is a piece of junk... I would stay away from this. I bought this to keep my dog from climbing a cyclone fence and getting hit by a car. I am glad it failed before I placed any confidence in it."
4,At Last....,"....Lookee Here, the DVD is here! No wonder she is the Arab Diva. Quite enjoyable. Why 4 stars? Few moments in the first two video clips could have been better. But Natahca Atlas Rules! The live performance is so dynamic, natural and moving. Of course waiting for more of her work. It is always a good occasion and one of the pleasures to break the routine of the daily grind."
5,Very nice and refershing,"I love Natacha Atlas. The video quality may not be as good as the American videos but it is very nice, and I know it it better than most of the Lebanese music videos that come out of the Middle East. She has her own distinct way and she doesn't try to emulate wester vidoes."
2,Very blusey,You have to really like blues to like this cd. I have a hard time with it. Don't think I've listened to the whole cd yet.
5,From Leuctra to the Battle of France,"Simon Goodenough examines the commanders and the battles that made them famous. From Epaminondas at Leuctra, to Erich von Manstein and Heinz Guderian in France in 1940. Who else is profiled? William the Conqueror, the Duke of Marlborough, Napoleon, HoratioNelson, Themistocles, Grant, Belasarius, Alexander the Great, Douglas MacArthur, Ramesses II, Joseph Pilsudski,Montgomery, and current Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.A must read."
1,It was really bad,This CD wasn't what I thought it would be. The lyrics and the beat of the music didn't go together real well. This CD was totally wack. I wouldn't buy it and I wouldn't suggest that anyone else buy it either.
4,"Slashing Swords, Flashing Puns","More fun than ""Bored of the Rings"" and more puns than ""Rocky and Bullwinkle"". If you like swords and sorcery stories, but have a sense of humor about them, you'll enjoy this book. Read it for both the swordplay and the wordplay."
5,"The best, but skip if you own the Third Edition","This is arguably the last word in watchmaking, generously and clearly written and illustrated to provide just about every practical piece of information you need.I have owned the Third Edition for some time, and was very excited to see an update, especially in the wake of Mr. Daniels' passing in October 2011. I was disappointed to find that the only updates seem to be two color photos of Mr. Daniels, eight small photos of his shop from 2010, and the changing of ""fifty years"" to ""sixty years"" in the Acknowledgements. The Preface is still called ""Preface to the Third Edition."" The table of contents and index are also identical.So, if you are one of those lucky ones who already own the Third Edition, you're probably better off saving your money. If you weren't able to obtain one, and are somehow living without this amazing tome, you owe it to yourself to buy it now."
3,Not for the casual listener,"The insert in the case has a brief history of the Highland bagpipe, both in English and French.This is a wierd collection of piping performances from someone who apparently brought a tape recorder to several different events and held it out to get whatever sound they could pick up. The sound quality varies with the selection. The bands are not usually identified. In one track you can hear as a parade marches by. The pipes get louder, then fade as the drums grow louder. You can hear crowd sound on most of the tracks. Most of the selections are standard pipe tunes. Even with the marginal quality, I enjoy listening to the cd sometimes and hearing the various sounds of the different bands. I like the atmosphere of being at a parade or highland games. You won't listen to this cd to appreciate really fine sounding pipes or admire great playing in a studio setting. But you will be able to enjoy how pipe bands normally sound in real life, playing for crowds."
1,Macintosh users should avoid this one.,"The device seems to work, however, it will not communicate with my Apple machine. I was successful in getting it to work on my past laptop after 3-4 hours of experimentation. This last device was loaned to me and I got it working. So I bought one for myself, and have struggled with it for three days now. The manufacturer is no help at all. They provided me with a new driver--which was the same as the one I was using. The issue seems to be the OS X software and the method to link up for communications. All the Mac software queries send you over to Windows configuration--which doesn't work on a MAC.So I don't recommend this product or this manufacturer for any Apple users."
2,"Powerful, but Big","This battery adds 3/4 inch to the length and 1/4 inch to the depth of a T18, which is impossible to tell from the photograph. It also adds a corresponding amount of weight. It fits loosely on the phone and moves about a bit, though it hasn't disconnected itself. Because of it's size, it will not fit in Ericsson's desktop charger. The connectors aren't different, the charger is just designed with a smaller slot. So there doesn't seem to be any way to ""discharge ni-cad batteries to prevent memory damage."" I have doubts about it's long term usefulness. In it's favor, it does hold a great big charge - good for about three days at the rate I use my phone."
4,"Incompatible with ""Ericsson Dual Slot Charger""","This battery is physically longer and fatter than the standard battery. Don't expect to get a normal size battery with more capacity. Its not that much bigger but the size caused it to not work with the charger I purchased along with it. I didn't get to use the battery because I returned it. Do not purchase this battery for use with the ""Ericsson Dual Slot Charger""."

1,Are they for micro-spray?,"Half of these items I received were too large for micro-spray nozzles. All were marked Olson Irrigation. Half were correct diameter for micro-spray threads, half were oversize."
2,"Some love it, some hate it","Mixed reviews. Always hard to come to a conclusion when half the reviews are 5 stars and the other half are one. So let's break it down: Sound, very good. I had to toy with my 5.1 settings a bit but finally got it and was happy. Sight: great, sharp video. Extras, good, some cool old footage. So what's the problem? First, I really wish this was a normal show with just Moterhead doing its thing. Instead we get about a third of the songs with guests joining the band and it's totally lame. Secondly, as seems to be the current fad the video jumps all over at that ""MTV generation/beyond short attention span"" rate. The cameras are not still for a second. I'm in my 30s and I know that the younger people have grown-up with this sort of thing but I still cannot get used to it. So there you have it. If you don't mind strobe-like, video game-like camera movements and hacks like Doro destroying Motorhead classics you will love this DVD."
5,Ignore the negative !!!!!!,I don't get the (few) bad reviews this dvd is getting. The sound and picture quality are above standard and the camera movement captures the excitement of the show. The extra features alone are worth the price. If you are into Motorhead this one will not let you down!!
5,it;s a bomber,"Twenty five alive, dvd. It's motorhead. If your a true motorheadbanger, this is for you. Watch on large screen tv. with surround sound, it's the next best thing to being there. It's put out on a german label, will play on any machine. The first 20 songs are prettys much the usual set list, God save the queen, You better run & broken, the exceptions. The last three are well worth the wait. Bomber. Ace of spades & Overkill, done just so right. Accompanied by the bomber (HE 111), from thier early tours. These songs not recorded @ same venue as previous 20. they were shot @ european outdoor festival. Lighting is very good as bomber set hovers feet above band. Lemmy, Phil & mikkey are very electric during these songs. The last, Overkill, has guest guitarists. Fast Eddie among others. Brian May appears also, to this day I've no idea why. That aside I like the hell out of this DVD. There is never a bad Motorhead song, only poorly produced ones"
2,"Good material, bad sound, bad footage","This DVD only deserves 3 stars for the following reasons; the material is good, the list of songs is really representative of this group. The sound is disappointing, all the songs in the main concert begin with good sound, but as soon the camera zooms out the volume is reduced and many times it varies during the song. The footage is disappointing as well, the are no good angles, seems like the cameras are statical and they only can zoom in and zoom out."
1,Worthless,"Not only are the screws cheap (they threaded immediately, forcing me to use a handheld screwdriver), but the straps don't tighten at all, either. The furniture isn't any more safe than it was before all the trouble of installing them. Completely worthless."
1,Terrible,These might have worked better if I had bought different screws. I just couldn't get these to work at all.
4,"You may need different screws, but a good product overall","These are very well-designed. Easy to install and gives you a bit of room behind the furniture to access plugs and such.We did have problems with the screws breaking, but only when we were trying to install the straps on older, brittle wood furniture. When we attached the straps to our new dresser, the screws went in amazingly easily. So if you have older wood furniture (or wall studs, for that matter) go and buy some proper wood screws and use those instead!"
5,Safety for my kids,Now I a can leave my childs room without being scared that big desk going to tip over on them. I never had these growing up but I have had heard horror stories about dressers falling on kids. It is only couple bucks well worth it.
4,Quick intro to unfamiliar topic,"This is the second Introducing Graphic Guide I have read (Introducing Sartre was the first). These guides are a great way to quickly learn about subjects you have heard about all your life but actually know nothing about. (I learned enough about both of these philosophers to know not to bother reading any of their works. I also developed a deep sympathy for poor Nietzsche, who probably had Asperger's Syndrome or something similar. For a great philosopher, he lived a truly miserable life.)The only negative thing I can say about the guides is that I didn't like the illustrations in the Nietzsche Guide, which I found wierd, sometimes confusing, and often depressing. But then, that was what Nietsche was like!"
3,"In my opinion, the ""Introducing"" series are well worth the money","I can only give this one 3 of 5 stars. Maybe it's just me, but I thought this book was about as entertaining as one of Nietzsche's books. Long, dry, boring."
1,Dried up,"These are not for a 4 year old that may not put the cap on all the way each time. They dry out VERY quickly. They didn't even last a week in my house. I assume they may work longer if the cap gets put on ALL the way?????? Very disappointed, all our other markers work, not these"
4,"Sweet, cute, and simple anime ...","Hand Maid May will offer you nothing you haven't seen before as an anime fan. Still, I give it credit for being consistently entertaining, fun, and featuring really funny characters. It's great to see a ""harem"" anime where the women are actually friendly and not out to kill each other. I love the energy of the quasi-villian, too.However, as cute and funny as Hand Maid May is, the show also has its fair share of touching moments, especially in the middle and the end. If it weren't for the irritating OVA, this anime would be really great, if not original. As it is, it's just good, but that still makes this show well worth your time.P.S. And no, it's not sexist."
4,"A fun little anime, not to be missed!","atthecon.com reviewed this anime. This was a fun little anime, not too deep, not too much fan service or slapstick. A lot of fun. If you like this type of genre then you will enjoy this anime. 4/5."
1,"cute, butt...","The story is a cute idea, and May herself is very cute, too. But...or should I say ""butt""...the panty shots and boob jiggles get to be a little much even before the first episode is over. If only real life were like this...It's all silly-cute, I guess.Actually, the part I find offensive is the antagonist, Nanbara. His voice and actions are so painfully annoying, I found myself muting him whenever he made an appearance. I can't tell you how much I hate that character, and when you first pop in the DVD, it opens to ""Nanbara's Room"" which is just too excrutiating to describe.If you're a hard-up anime fan and the only time you ever get to see a pair of white, cotton panties is when they're drawn on short-skirted cartoons, then this title is definitely for you!"
3,"Less is More - Sadly, they don't agree.","I really wanted to like this series, and for the first few episodes I did. Saotome, Kasumi and May make for an enjoyable show. But once Kei, Mami, Rena, Sara, and the annoying Nambara get added to the mix, the show is just diluted beyond hope. It's a Tenchi / Hina formula that just doesn't work and too many characters are just plain annoying.Not to give anything away, but later in the show things come together and wrap up rather well, if quite a bit stretched. The ending is quite nice. This series had a chance of being great, but it ends up simply sub par. If you really like Robo Girl series and Tenchi / Hina series, give it a shot. The first few and last few episodes are quite worth watching. Sadly, the middle is rather filler.- Rirath_com"
1,Not My Cup of Tea,"When writing this review I had to click the ""I am over the age of 13"" and maybe that's the problem and why I disliked this anime. You must be 13 or under male to enjoy this series. If you like a lot of fanservice you'll love this series and I'm not saying I don't like a little fanservice but this series seems nothing but. They beat you over the head until you beg for them to stop. The start menu is confusing and I almost thought I had a defective disk until I hit every option and it took me to the real menu. The villian is extremely annoying and Sara whose main job is to repo May is incompetent. It's story after story of how they fail to repo May along with panty shot after panty shot. You'll never mistake this for any anime with a substantial plot. I understand this is harem anime but there are good series that fit under the genre. Gertrude Stein once said, ""A rose is a rose is a rose"" meaning things are what they are. This anime is a turd is a turd is a turd."
2,one up for the little ecchi,"If you're under 13, this is not for you. If you're above 18, why would you get this one? May is a special robot, a cyberdoll with a maid program who lives with an engineering student Kazuya. A cyberdoll with feelings? Actually, those humanoid robots with feelings are nothing but old concepts already. As much as this anime tries to be a touching comedy, there are more perverted scenes than comedic lines that you will notice. No, it's not like Ranma 1/2. Ranma 1/2 can be ecchi but Rumiko Takahashi knows how to concentrate on the great script and charm slapstick. (...)"
4,Real HipHop outta...Where?! Seattle?!,"I've been onto these guys for awhile. I was surprised to hear that Seattle is back in the rap game so many years after Sir Mixalot.This is nothing like the Seattle rap we were all hyped on back in the ""I Like Big Butts and i cannot lie"" era. This real, genuine, original Hip Hop in the tradition of KRS 1, Black Sheep Swollen Members, Dilated Peoples. Anyway, You get the picture.Do Not Sleep! please belive it...this is the stuff!"
5,Nice Shirt - Good Price,I wore the shirt a couple of times. My only negative comment is actually about the cleaners. They have lots of problems with pleats and seem to think that it's acceptable to send you back a shirt with pleats ironed in different directions. I have to hand iron any of my formal shirts with pleats.
4,pretty good workout for the lower body,"I am not too crazy about Denise Austin, since I find her sort of annoying, but this workout really isn't a bad one. I really feel like I have toned my lower body after I do this exercise video."
5,A great book that teaches values using real-life examples.,"The title caught my attention but the comment that it was ""everything William Bennett's book should have been and wasn't"" was what sparked the interest to buy it. And I must say that our family agrees with that comment. Unlike Bennetts' book, this book is one that gives examples of values and situations in which young and old alike find themselves. Our family uses this book,one chapter a night, to read, discuss and learn each of the values. It is a great tool to use with our twin eight-year olds. The way we utilize it works for us and truly makes lasting impressions on our children. We limit the sessions to weekly or we run out of chapters in two weeks. We go back and revisit certain chapters if situations warrant. A great book that teaches values by real-life examples. We reccommend it for any family with children."
5,Excellent book for adults and children alike,"This is a wonderful book to help teach children values and to remind us, as adults, of the values we hope to emulate. My son and I read this together and it has led to many interesting and stimulating discussions. The stories are great learning tools, as are the suggestions for activities and discussion. I highly recomend this to anyone - with or without children."
5,A Manual For Success,"I had the golden opportunity to hear Rabbi Dosick, give a lecture several years ago at Temple Bet Breira in Miami for their annual ""Scholars in Residence"" Week. Rabbi Dosick touched upon several things as it relates to this informative book about parenting. Golden Rules is not a preachy, rigid stance but a personal, yet provocative approach that parents can take to show their children how they are an important part of the world society and how their contribution can provide a means to help the less fortunate. One walks away from this book with a somber sense that our respect of God is determined by how much we're devoted to service."
2,"Love the book, but...",...can't give it as a gift with the library markings on the spine! REALLY!?! Shouldn't you at least have disclosed that in the description? I like giving this gift as a baby shower gift. It's a lovely book for new parents to point out the important things.
1,Very Superficial,This commentary lacks scholarly depth. There is no real theological or exegetical insights here and I was a bit disappointed to find the commentator making a claim for universalism on the basis of this epistle. Very disappointing overall.
3,3 - 4 seconds of silence between songs....,"The songs are very upbeat (except Sugar, Sugar and More today than yesterday...not sure why they are on there while all the other songs are upbeat) but I bought the cd for a dance party and can't use it because of the looonggg 3 - 4 second silence between songs....which would seem like an eternity if you have people standing on a dance floor in complete silence."
4,Great diapers,"We were looking for disposable diapers that were somewhat better for the environment and happened upon these. We really like the fact that they are chlorine-free since dioxins (by-products of bleaching) are harmful to our environment. However, warning: they do resemble paper bags. :) We're not sure about if the dioxins stay on the diapers and affect our baby but we figure we could do without the chemicals. We found these diapers to be very absorbent and had very few leaks since we started using them 1.5 months ago. The only cons: they're a bit more bulky than conventional brands & a bit more expensive . But, they do go on sale occasionally, so we stock up then. :)"
2,Yuka is VERY sexy....sometimes...,"Don't get me wrong. Half the DVD is Yuka being happy, smiling, while in a swimsuit, talking about happy memories and being bouncy. Great stuff.The other half of the DVD is her standing in one place, as comfortable as a GI standing on a armed land mine! I blame the director. This is NOT a photo shoot for a magazine, this is MOVING pictures. The whole thing should of been her, talking about her life, being happy, smiling and mostly half-undressed.The DVD has a photo gallery in it and a glossy fold-out came with my DVD, giving birth date, height, measurements and blood type (which was cool), but I had to take away three stars because of how 'artistic' they tried to make it(sorry Yuka).I'm going to buy the Race Queen DVDs and review them also. I bet Race Queens don't just stay in one place and look serious!"
3,Good but could be better,"So the shipping was fast and the product was as described, the only thing was the lack of adapters and the old fasion style connections for oil and the extremely big sensor for the water temp. It is huge, so if you got a import it can be tricky to install. I have a 328 BMW and i went to so many places to find the adapter needed to fit oil to the oil pressure gauge, turns out the only place i could get one was a guy who makes them...lolSo again the product is more friendly to domestic than imports and works great for the price, but next time i will go with something different..."
5,love greek!,"Love the show, and I'm happy to have started my collection. Also bought Greek Chapter One. Will buy the rest."
5,For the true Greek fans!,"If you are a ""Greek"" fan just like me that has followed the program from the beginning to its very end, this is a MUST in you collection!! You can enjoy the series from the comfort of your home and you can spread the word about this great series! I've got all my friends hook with it and they cannot believe that it finally ended."
4,"The oval lady, beyond the surrealism","I had read this book a couple of months ago. In my opinion, the short stories of The Oval Lady go about the nonsense and deep messages about society in a way that few authors can get. The Oval Lady crosses the barrier of surrealism and takes into short and easy-to-read stories the wide imagination, personal mithology of Carrington. I strongly recommend this book. Once you get into the world of Leonora, you will charmed by the way she writes and explores her own oniric world."
4,Simply great compositions with unsurpassed complexity.,"This is a very intense cd set. The music composed and compiled in the set was made by some of the hard core new age artists i.e Robert Fripp, Steve Roach and some others that are equally good but not as well known. It is always new sound regardless of how many times you listen to it. It is mood music. Eventhough some of it sounds ""dark"", it inspires a sense of awe in listener. It will envelope itself around your being. It is music to listen to with the ears of your soul. It is like a story of the modern day living in a dark society. It has remained one of my favorite music no matter what else came my way. I Do recommend it. But, it not for everyone. You have to listen to this and absorb it thoroughly before you can get it's full effect.Great music for creative work. Meditate with the dark side but become enlightened!"
2,Not my kind of thing,"I bought this album for one reason: its second CD starts at track 11. Other than that I really didn't have any reason at all, but I really needed it to test some software I'd written. In retrospect, I would've been better off just burning a CD myself and putting some random music on it, because this album is just not my kind of thing. If you don't like New Age music, stay far away from Swarm of Drones!"
3,my husband likes it,"I'm completely indifferent about this CD as I'm not a big Willie Nelson fan, but my husband really likes it."
2,To many characters,"The first couple of pages promised a nice cozy mystery novel and a sleuth, Louise Eldridge, who would be fun to spend an afternoon with. Not so. Way to many characters are thrown into the mix, and the victim seems not to have even one redeeming quality. The newly elected First Lady is silly, the dialogue is forced and plot withers like a vine after the first frost."
1,Horrible,"I can't believe someone would write such a depressing story. How cruel the story was to the monster, who only wanted friendship. His only friend was a stone rabbit. At least he had that. Then one day the monster didn't come out of his cave. What!??DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK"
1,Tried to be open minded...just didn't work.,"A pity the art work is so good because the text is so awful. I passed the book around the library and we all thought it was a bad book with no redeemming social value. ""If you are not beautiful, crawl in a cave and die with no friends or future"" is not a message I want to give young children. Prozac would have to be given out with their snack. Pass this one up."
1,"Terrible message, lousy illustrations, boring prose","I often read customer reviews and rarely write them, but in this case I felt obligated to warn fellow parents about the negative messages in this children's book. This story teaches that even if you're beautiful inside, physical unattractiveness will doom you to a life alone. The prose and illustrations are mediocre at best; quite honestly I'm not sure how this book made it through publishing. As a parent, I wouldn't even give it away. I'd give it zero stars if I could."
1,Zero Stars,"The message I got from this book is that it doesn't matter what kind of person you are, it only matters what you look like--and if you're unattractive, the whole world suffers until you die. So if you want a book that makes you feel ugly and alone, this book is for you!"
1,terrible book,"This is one of the worst picture books I have ever read. I kept waiting for there to be some sort of uplifting or positive note and there wasn't. Don't buy it, it's depressing."
4,A thinking book,"I loved this book however,I would not reccomend this it for younger students. It is a nice departure from the happy endings we've come to expect in picture books. It is a thinking book. It would make an excellent read-aloud for older grades and would provide endless discussion topics ranging from: beauty, rejection, isolation even bullying. Perfect for those awkward teenage years when everyone feels rejected and friendless at one time or another. Students should be guided through this book and helped to understand its messagesBethany-Preservice Teacher"
5,2 year old LOVES this vanity,"I bought this for my 2 yr old neice and she can't get enough of it. She loves the extras - like the nail polish, lipstick and blow dryer. She plays with it all the time - can't get enough. Good quality plastic - sturdy too!"
5,"dan wesson 6"" barrel","this holster fits my dan wesson 15-2 6"" barrel like a glove. the leather work is good and the hardware is good. the stiching is good. strong side and cross draw work just fine. all around bang for the buck A-1. metal mike."
2,If you are looking for a blast from the past....,"Slow Ride and Woman from Tokyo were definitely not the original length, and I was quite disappointed. If you actually remember these songs, you will find yourself anticipating the next few bars of music, jamming along, and suddenly, BAM, it's cut off and skipped to another section! Despite the nice selection on this CD, having those two songs chopped up took away from the whole experience. I will be more careful next time!"
3,Dry and too fruity,"These are not awful if eaten with a cup of tea, coffee or milk -- but they are very dry if eaten plain. I do like how they have less sugar than most granola bars and are not a choking hazard for toddlers like hard snacks can sometimes be. I am a fan of the oatmeal raisin mini cookies, and of the regular size EB cookies, but this flavor tastes very fruity to me and not very chocolaty. I think the double choc cherry tastes better than these. Happy to have them for last resort snack-on-the-go needs, but not my favorite."
2,poor quality control.... moldy,"My kids love these, and we've ordered them often - but as was the case with at least one other reviewer, this batch came in with some mold. (I freeze them as soon as they arrive, so had the have been moldy upon arrival.)too bad - but at this price, won't run the risk of having to toss out product."
5,Breakfast Cookies,"Erin Baker's products are a favorite for my family. The breakfast cookie mini's are great for snacks & coffee breaks and especially good for traveling.This is a denser product than a regular cookie, nice and chewy and filling with only 100 calories."
1,This is book is boring and to long!!!,This book is so boring it took me three days to read it. I did not want to finish it but I paid for it. It starts okay then goes down hill from there. It was no need for this book to be so long. I LOVE her other books but this one is not as good as the others.
1,Shoulda let somebody else tell the story Woulda been better..,"I have tried to give this author the benefit of doubt, first book was so ghetto I didn't think I could even finish it however the storyline was pretty good so what do I do? Go buy the next book it was a sequel what can I say? And I truly though her writing skills had improved. So I go out and buy this next book. First let me say what the hell did it profit for her to write about the characters daughter seeing her grandfather's peanut (as she calls it in the book) and then to say how it was big and almost touched his knees!!! Right then I knew she had lost her mind. (The author) once an again a good storyline had somebody with more experience had written it. I am not a hater I am an avid reader I know a good story when I read one. Looks like this one will also have a sequel I will wait until I see it a garage sale."
4,La Jill brings the drama!,"""Shoulda Woulda Coulda"" was an easy and interesting read. It is the story of a young woman named Paige. Paige is dealing with so much from an unfaithful mama's boy of a man and baby father, Marlon. Marlon's psycho drunk mama Ms. Lucille, who Paige has a fight with (too funny) and who wants nothing to do with Paige or her grandbaby Myla. Not to mention Paige recently lost a child...I really felt for her. I'm glad thing turned out the way they did. Very good read!"
5,5 STARS... WOW!,"This book was a excellent. I could not put it down. I hope there will be a part 2. This was my first book by La Jill Hunt. It gave me some very insightful tips for my own life situation. All in all, I would recommend every woman and man to read this book."
4,now that's drama,la jill hunt keeps up the title drama queen in this new classic. keep it coming jill
4,Good Read,I enjoyed this book and I can't wait to see what happens in the sequel. Celestine got on my last nerves and the sad thing is that I know a couple of people like her. Keep up the good work LaJill.
3,And Didn't,I've read other titles by LJH and this one did not dissappoint me. Seems as though her style is always the same. The book entertained and kept me reading and that's what I bought it for. I was looking for a little more drama I guess but I'm not the author. I'd buy her next one seeing as though I have all of her others.
5,"""Must Read""!","Wow! La Jill Hunt storytelling is Awesome!I couldn't put the book down!I finish it in two days!This is a definite ""must-read""!Can't wait to read the follow-up to this book."
5,La Jill loves that drama,"La Jill Hunt brings the drama again introducing Paige Michaels and her ""I wish I had done this and that. This was a real page turner. I finished this in 1 day even with my two little girls running around... Thanks La Jill. I'm one of your biggest fans!"
3,A little disappointed,"I was extremely pleased with these pans..size just ""perfect"" for the two of us.. and, would have given 5 STARS....however. the house smelled like ""burnt rubber"" after using pans in a 325 degree oven. Even after washing them if you brought the pan near your nostrils...you could smell the silcone as if it had been burnt.I had originally wanted to purchase white ceramic au gratins but thought that the Anolon would be the right way to go. the nonstick interior is perfect..if you can get past the smell. I will try using a few more times..perhaps the smell will ""burn"" off"
4,Ease of Use,These casseroles are perfect for making up individual pot pies or lasagna's or whatever. They clean up very easily even if you do not coat them prior to use.
5,Floating on Air,Very comfortable! Almost fell asleep while floating on air. Construction seems strong and has locks that keeps the chair in any position you desire. One word of caution; if you have a big butt you might want to consider the X-large size. I wear a 36-38 pant size and I had about 2 inches on both sides. The width is comparable to airline seats.
5,Terrific Zero Gravity Recliner,"This Faulkner chair is extremely WELL MADE-- very sturdy/ a little heavier than some/ but worth it! Fabric is very comfortable/ not ""scratchy"" where you need to cover it with a light blanket or towel. Mine stays on a convered patio-- and I feel ""like a ""queen"" when I set it back into the full back/rest position-- be careful-- you might fall asleep in this wonderful chair-- and you awaken feeling no back pain/ just rested and well ! Ordered it from Amazon!"
2,too fast!,"Not much ballet here, felt very much like an aerobics class. Nice combinations but tempo is way TOO FAST for much of it. Not that the movements are too difficult at all, but it's just crazy level fast. Hard to enjoy, felt very frantic."
2,Beware of your joints!,"I began ballet last year (being 23) and I thought this DVD might be a nice cardio-oriented workout which at the same time might allow me to use movements I know. Oh my! I don't have any knee problems and yet, after only 5 minutes, my knees were cracking loudly! Why? Because pliés or reverences are NOT supposed to be fast-paced, it doesn't allow you to concentrate on your form and while trying to keep up, you naturally shift you position and harm yourself. I will not use this DVD again. Working out is supposed to lead to good health, and while it seems very efficient for toning and shaping, I don't want to end up with joint problems I didn't have to begin with, for the sake of appearances."
4,Great All-Over Toner!,"When I first heard of these ballet workouts I shy-ed away on account of my lack of coordination. However, I decided to give this one a try after seeing a few trial clips online. I really like that it is low impact which is great for anyone with joint issues. I also like that it's right to the point: hits the thighs, hips, butt, and abs right away. It's also not time consuming if you break up the segments such as doing the total body three days a week and the arms and abs two days a week. I use this routine along with a steady jogging/walking regimen as well. You also don't have to be coordinated. It may take a few tries at first with some moves, but if a clutz like me can get it, anyone can!"
4,Dance fun,"This DVD provides ""dance type"" exercise for those who enjoy that. Good direction is given for the steps and exercises, but it gets very fast to provide cardio and I am doing it at my own pace, slower. I feel I can work up to the faster pace, but the exercises are still good done slowly. I like the format with a warm-up, a cool down and the three options of exercises for upper body, leg and hips (barre), and core. It makes it possible to do a workout that includes the whole body or to choose to do one section at a time. Having done ballet growing up, these exercises are fun for me and helpful."
3,Nice,"Very nice, calm, flow is well you will be chiseled when you do this workout. Great for beginners also because there is a moderator."
5,Best Workout!!!,"You will love this workout if your looking to tone and enjoy working out at the same time! It's an easy to understand instructional video on the Barre method. You can get a full body workout or choose to focus on arms, legs, or abs by themselves if you want. I would say its a must have workout video!!! I LOVE IT!!!"
2,Sorry Andrea,"Disappointed. I dont like giving negative reviews, but this was not what it was sold to be. The music didnt match and felt very 90s aerobic video. The moves were OK but not the ""lean and Chiseling"" results that it claimed. I have probably done around 100 videos and DVD's over my life time, and I would list this one near the bottom. Sorry Andrea."
3,Watch out,"Good for cardio, but be careful, you can hurt yourself because of this fast-paced workout : you don't have the time to watch your posture. And the stretching section is way too short."
5,Excellent,"Excellent workout, but challenging too. I love it. I hope this will condition my body. I know it will along with the other ballet DVDs."
5,Great workout!,"Great barre workout, wonderful cueing. Would definitely purchase more Xtend workouts. Easy to do sections if I don't have time for the whole workout."
3,Dancer body BUT BEWARE of injuries,"This video is great for toning areas you never knew you could tone . . but as a fairly active 30something female I have experienced several injuries mostly from staining my calves and hip muscles. I use the ""easy"" model to follow, and again, the video is great for whipping you into ""wedding"" shape - just wait a couple days in between and make sure to stretch!"
3,Too Fast Didnt like DVD.,"I didnt like this dvd. The music was too fast and too hard, couldnt keep up, probably rate this dvd advanced workout.Regards Carol . Australia."
4,"Good, not too difficult","This is a great lower body workout, I felt like it started out a bit slow, but my legs were sore the next day, so it must have worked! I like that it's different, with the ballet focus, than typical work out and aerobic videos."
3,Didn't deliver,"I wasn't impressed with this workout video at all. It seemed more of a strength and stretching workout then a toning and shaping workout. The moves are very simple and straight forward, but I didn't even break a sweat doing this workout."
2,DVD sound is 1 second off from video.,"So when she's instructing, her moving lips is 1 second ahead of hearing her instructions. Not a bad video in terms of exercise, but when you're following her direction, you can't help but notice this."
1,Boring,"Quite simply, it is boring. I also find the instructor a bit annoying, but that's my problem! I'll dust it off every now and again."
1,I haven't lost weight yet.,I have been exercising to this dvd for the last month. I still have not lost weight. Very disappointed. I am going to stick with watching the Biggest Looser.
1,Many deep and quick knee bends ... painful for this regular exerciser,"I bought this DVD confident in the other positive reviews. However, to my great dismay there are many quick and deep knee bends that left me, an active person in my thirties, in agony. I am trading this in for an Amazon $5.00 gift card tonight."
1,Starts out Fast with Lots of Cardio,"This routine is not for me. I previously purchased (and love) Barre3 with Sadie Lincoln which is a compbination of pilates, yoga and ballet. I thought Xtend Barre: Lean & Chiseled would be a variation of this; it is not. It is very fast paced with a lot of cardio right from the very beginning of the routine. No instruction on range of motion or body positioning. If you're not up to that kind of strenuous speed, or not familiar with the correct moves, it seems to me that you could injure yourself pretty quickly. This routine would just be another dust collector for me."
3,little to advanced for a beginner,Little advanced for a beginner. I am hoping the more I do this the easier it gets. Keeping my fingers crossed.
4,Awesome workout!,This is exactly what I was looking for! I used to dance ballet and really missed how my body looked while doing so.My work has prevented me from going to ballet class and this workout works my *dance muscles* exactly what I wanted to getthat long lean dancer body back!Love it!
5,A really nice compliment to other barre workouts,"I started barre workouts way back with the Lotte Berk series, moved on to Burr Leonard and last year, Exhale's, all of which I really enjoy. I was still looking for something a little more cardio but in this same genre and I found it with Xtend Barre. I LOVED this DVD - it was fun, reminded me a little of my ballet classes as a kid and it really gave me what I was looking for on the days I need more cardio. Andrea is a great instructor, perfect! I still love Burr's new DVD's and Exhale's, but this is going to be a staple in my DVD rotation. Love it and highly recommend it!! As a side note, I am a dressage rider and while I loved the visual results from the Jillian Michael's series, it virtually ruined my riding, which I find interesting since Jillian herself is a dressage rider. This DVD is perfect for including cardio while also allowing my body to remain supple and flexible, which is a must in the saddle."
4,I was dripping sweat....,"When done correctly this is a great workout. I say correctly because if I had not taken previous dance classes (just some adult ballet) and known the correct placement of knees, hips etc...I don't think it would have affected me as much. I have friends that have never danced and it did make them sore but I didn't see them dripping sweat like me..haha...My only negative is that having taken some dance some of the movements are a little fast. I prefer to take them a little slower and do them correctly than speed them up just to say I kept up with her pace. Overall I think this is a great workout even if you have never taken dance before...especially if you aren't used to all those releves and arabesques!"
4,Great workout,"Very enjoyable total body workout. The separate sections for arms, abs, and legs are very effective. It doesn't feel too hard as you are going through it but it gets my heart rate up and I'm usually a little sore the next day."
2,Xtend Barre,"I can't say that this tape was bad, it was just too difficult for me and have done several Bar Method tapes with no problem. The biggest problem was that Amazon charged me $18.81 plus $2.96 tax for restocking!! Huge waste of money!"
2,Tries to include everything and doesn't cut it,"I was looking for a ballet type workout, but the problem with this is that it tries to include a cardio section and other things. The exercises are rushed through, and not enough reps are done to feel anything. I didn't even break a sweat, and didn't feel any muscle use like I usually do when I start a new workout."
1,Have not received the product yet!!! it's been almost a month!!,I've placed my order on January 4th. It's January 29 and haven't received it yet.... and haven't heard back from anyone!!
3,Too old and out of shape,Instructor goes too quickly and doesn't explain much about working up to some of the positions. Users should definitely have prior knowledge of what to expect.
4,Fun but great workout!,"It's harder than it looks, but it's a great workout that is lots of fun to do! Glad I bought it!"
2,Pace way too frantic/manic for me....,"I wanted to like this DVD. A lot of other people certainly think highly of it. But I just couldn't believe how ""fast paced"" it was...and ""fast paced"" is not the right term - manic is more like it. Although I'm in my mid-40's, I have been very active/fit my entire life, I do pretty intense yoga and exercise DVDs don't usually throw me for a loop. With this DVD my knees and back routinely hurt the next day and I was afraid I would eventually injure a joint. The exercises are good, but the pace is frantic. In fact, when my 9-year-old son saw me exercising to it, his comment was ""Mom, you look like one of the chickens when the dog is trying to catch it."" Not sure what exactly that meant, but I knew it couldn't be good. Gave it away the next day."
3,The music is annoying,"I find that this ballet workout is rather good, but there are two points I dislike: the music is horrible and I do not find it fitting for the kind of exercise being done. Second, she insists too much on doing movements fast.I have recently tried the ballet workout of Jennifer Gallardi and found it considerably better, even if the movements are similar.However, if you don't mind the music or can turn down the volume it gets better."
4,Adding this to my regimen,"Last night I did the Barre workout (Fitness TV). I had taken ballet as a young girl so I was already familiar with the positions. Even so, this workout was challenging! There were points where I was out of breath and at the point of muscle failure! I definitely feel stronger in my core today, and I find myself zipping up my abs and standing up straighter too. I wanted to add that I have knee injuries and this workout did not bother me one bit, although I was sore afterward. I will be adding this to my workout regimen of stationary bike and plyometrics."
5,My favorite cardio ballet workout by now!,"I think this workout is carefully designed so that your body feel challenged yet energized after doing it-not like those just tire you out and left you feel uncomfortable. The coach's instruction is to the point, without the annoying chatting in some workout which distracts you. Overall, I love it and do it at least once per week."
4,"Great workout, awful music...",LOVE this workout but the music is migraine inducing. Another review mentioned manic and that is spot on. I would expect the music to be fluid and flowing like the moves but it's nightclub-esque however without the melodies....mostly just frantic high pitched beats. Doesn't fit the workout in my opinion. I guess it's good I can turn the volume off:( . Otherwise a great product!
1,USELESS,Well what do we expect for $129. Live and learn. Typical of Asian machines it's very poorly made. Expect to put in many hours 'tweeking' it - which by the time you end up doing that you could have made your own. I'll end up using the parts in a redesigned format. Save your money and build your own.
1,Superficial History,"You will learn very little about Zhukov upon reading this book. The majority of the work is merely a brief summary of the war on the Eastern front 1941-45. Any detailed descriptions of Zhukov and his life are confined to his early years leading up the Russian Revolution of 1917. There is no insight into his methods of waging war, his mind, his strategies or what moulded his thinking on waging war. There is not even reasoned assessment of Zhukov the soldier at the end of the book. At times one wonders whether this is a biography or merely another potted history of the war on the Eastern Front. There are passing references to greater works by John Ericson and William Spahr amongst others. You will find nothing new or enlightning here. Rather read, Otto Preston Chaney or William Spahr."
1,Needs a good editor,"Picked this book up thinking it would be a sort of refresher on the Eastern Front. Unfortunately the writing is rather poor, leaving this reviewer utterly confused as to what the late Mr. Colvin was trying to say. The maps are also terribly inadequate with many of the place names mentioned in the text no where to be seen. With all due respect to the author(who died shortly after finishing this work and which may account for its many shortcomings), if studying the Russo-German War is a pastime of yours, you would be better off looking elsewhere."
4,"Excellent bargain, well worth the money!","This is an excellent neck machine without the big price tag of a professional or gym machine. The small footprint allows it to sit in a limited space and the weight is just right for an easy or extended, harder workout. If your gym does not have a neck machine and you need one this is the one for you!"
2,"Looks Really Nice, But No Assembly Instructions Included","Waiting to see how fast the company can get me assembly instructions, it's lying on my garage floor in pieces right now, seems like the pieces are very solid....I'll complete the review once instructions are received and I've had a chance to use the neck machine..."
3,Bye Bye Easy...,"I have followed you since the beginning but when you do something (twice) and then punish Bonnie for doing the same thing. Nope - I'm thru with ya. I realize the book takes place in an earlier era but I can read plenty of stuff that doesn't smack of Double Standard so again, I bid you goodbye - forever."
1,you really have to be hard up for a book to read,"I can't remember ever reading a book that I enjoyed less. The Easy person is so forced that no one would or could believe him. I,ve read other books by Mosley, but this, Easy Rawlins should just go away."
2,Used/Like New?,"I had no idea when I put this in my cart that it was a used book, and I think $5.62 for a used, dinged-up paperback it too high."
2,"Good reading,BUT",I was very disappointed with the end of this novel. It was as if something was missing'
2,Cinnamon Kiss,"Walter really surprised me in this one. I heard good things about his writting. Story was way slow, it just didn't keep me interested. The only reason I finished it is because my book club read it."
3,Just OK!,"Cinnamon Kiss, the latest novel of the Easy Rawlins Mysteries, was just an okay read. Although the novel was full of many twists, turns and unexpected events, it was not a page turner. Some characters were underdeveloped and Easy's behavior was frustrating. He seemd to go out on a limb unnecessarily.It has been suggested that reading all the previous books in the Easy Rawlins series would be beneficial to understand the characters in this novel."
3,Cinnamon Kiss,"First time reading a Mosley book. Way too many characters !! I forgot who was who and had to go back to refresh my memory. Overall, I felt the book is just OK. Not exciting, but it kept my interest.A from Austin"
5,Vintage Easy Rollins,"If you like Easy Rollins you will like this. It is that simple. Walter Moseley seems to get better with age and so does Easy. He smarter, deeper and more sensitive. Great read. If you haven't read any of this series start further back with Devil in The Blue Dress or Black Betty. But it's all good."
5,Synopsis,"(From the back cover)Cheetah & Leopard... no animal can match the intensity of their power and grace. On the horizon, the next victims draw near - crouched in the grass, senses honed, an explosive rush, claws extend and then the final clamp of fangs in a jugular embrace.Discover what separates these predators from all others. The cheetah, ultimate tactician, single minded in its abandon for the lightning-fast gazelle. And the leopard, an invincible opportunist lying in wait for the unwary. Both driven by pure instinct and the constant pressure to kill."
3,Hmm... a beat alone can't make a song great,"as much as this is an impressively inventive album, it lacks something. it seems to be like a heavy beat with some background sound. i think weak is what i'm trying to say. not much to each song, with thrE3 exceptions: ""Prime Audio Soup"", ""Oblivon/Humans"" and ""Acid Again"". other than that i find the album only good for mood music."
5,A Gateway Album,When I first purchased this CD in Phoenix 2 years ago I couldn't tell the difference between industrial and trance music. Wow! Was that a long time ago...This CD is an extraordinary accomplishment in music. Jack Dangers a.k.a MBM is truly a genius. This CD has something for everyone. I can listen to this no matter what mood i'm in. I love track #2 from the Matrix... This is a MUST have!!!
2,Aggressiveness and emotion do not great music make,"Contrary to the Amazon ""best of '98"" review above, I believe that MBM represents much of what's WRONG with the current wave of ""electronica"" groups. What I perceive in this cd is techno effects for their own sake, wild, bangy drumming that seems ultimately aimless, dissonant jazz effects that worked for Coltrane but seem pretentious in this pop music context, and the kind of pretentious lyrical aggressiveness that has made alternative rock music a bore in recent years. There is some inventiveness here, and people who like their music noisy and loud will like some of this, but I found it disappointing."
3,"Not bad, but not essential either","I'm a big Meat Beat Manifesto fan, and while ACTUAL SOUNDS AND VOICES is pretty good, it's not their best album by a long shot. It sounds mostly like the stuff that couldn't quite make it onto the truly awesome and excellent SUBLIMINAL SANDWICH. Worth getting if you're as big an MBM fan as I am, and if you absolutely couldn't get enough of SUBLIMINAL SANDWICH. But if you can only get one or two MBM discs, there's better albums to be had than this one."
1,where's the voices that are prmoised??,"I have been listeing to MBM since i was about 15, back in 91. I am a huge fam of 99% and satyricon, I am not however into their electronic music without vocals. I pretty much gave up on them b/c they abandoned the vocals, which is what made them industrial, which is what they were considered back then. I am not sure what you would call their music now, but when i herd of this album i got really excited that jack dangers would go back to adding vocals to the music. what a dissapointment, out of 15 songs, only 3 have vocals and it is not his usual rap style vocals. so if you see the title and think 99% or satyricon, dont be fooled, you will not like this CD. I do like some of their stuff that is loaded with really cool samples, but i didnt find much of that on here either, just a lot of really repetitive music that doesnt really go anywhere and doesnt have much power or emotion."
4,"A strong ""Florencia""","This is a good performance -- the artists are all strong and both they and the conductor have the feel of Catan's lush music and powerful emotions. I felt that the sound was a bit thin, so that some of the ensemble passages and, especially, Florencia's magnificent closing aria did not come through as strongly as they should have. If you have seen any of it sung live you will feel a little remote from this recording. All in all, however, I liked it."
5,the other half of music done in Africa,"Yes, I like this. I thought I liked the first one better, ""South Africa Homecoming,"" but maybe it was the beautiful animals. Now that I have heard this DVD a couple of times, I am so glad I bought it. Those little kids are so cute.Thank you Bill and Gloria for providing such wonderful music, information about other countries, letting us see other brothers and sisters, and sharing your lives and theirs with us.Mickey Thorne"
5,THE BEST CD EVER,I have bought a lot of Cds and i have over 500 cds at home and this is in my top ten. This is the best music i have ever listened to in my entire life. I highly recomend you buy this CD
1,The cheesiest stuff available!,"Man, I felt my IQ points just dropping away as I listended to ""Greetings from gotham city""...Overall, I must say that I just can't believe that ANYONE can take this stuff seriously..I mean, just look at him! What a waste of a perfectly good batch of blank CD's."
3,an insightful look at entrepreneurial terrors,"An excellent 200 pages book which is unfortunately 300 pages long. The first 100 pages are mostly self-absorbed blah blah and I nearly quit reading around there out of boredom. But then it gets good, really good. The rest is a very well-written story about the agonies of getting first funding and it's a cliff-hanger. Disappointingly, it ends there and we never know how the venture did once it got funding."
1,This book leapt right out of our hands-into the garbage!,"The fact that this book was about the 'dot.com' industry, did NOT make it interesting. In fact it read like a book that was really boring...like the way really boring books are. Get the idea? The 'author', realizing his first draft was 30,000 words short, felt the need to double his descriptive sentences by repeating them. EX: ""There was something between us that had been torn. It had not been torn before."" Or, ""...farther than the eye could see. They were beyond eyeshot"".Does the author think that unless he is redundant with his descriptions, driving his meaning into the ground, that no one will get it?It was difficult to even enjoy this so-called ""wild ride of a story"", when one is so distracted by the lame descriptions of being naked. Being caught in the blinding snow. And being naked.This story ""races along"" like a broken push-mower clogged with wet grass."
1,From Yuppie to Millionairupy,"Tom Ashbrook's song of himself is yet another chapter in his self-centered world, where he goes from being a boring yuppie newspaper editor to a still boring capitalist. He is the embodiment of a special world viewpoint, a man of privledge who nestles deeper into more comfortability. I'm sorry, but I'm not impressed."
1,E-Commerce Hype,"I thought that this story has been already told from countless perspectives. The Author (a former journalist) joins an internet start-up created by an apparently miserable, full-of-himself CEO. The Author works with this monger and eventually gets him to succumb to a share of the company, based on his share of the efforts.Please .. the hype on this book is unwarranted. Who needs to hear about another e-commerce start-up. Lets read about a success story. The final chapter on this story hasn't been written. The company has not gone public and has not faced the real e-commerce world.Nice try Tom (Author) but save this story for your kids and grandchildren. When the final chapter has been written - release it for reading. Not today!"
4,Personalizing Business Makes Good Reading,"Excellent account of leaping from job security to job risk for the rewards of founding and growing your own company. This is not a ""how-to do it"" book. It is more of a ""what I faced book"" with helpful pointers along the way-- the book does shows the steps in general terms of what an entrepreneur with a vision must do to succeed. Passion is a driving force and Mr. Ashbrook's account showed that he and his co-founder had it. The book is a touching and interesting read, with informative business points interlaced in it."
5,Be transported to another time and place,"This compilation manages to transport the listener to another world through the use of a variety of sound sculptures, atmospherics, and lush synthesizers. The ambience induces relaxation through the creation of organic soundworlds. A must have for any fan of ambient minimalism or anyone else who just wants to relax, ahhhh."
4,Good Read,"I thought it was a good quick read book. He had a few things in it that were very very insightful. While it's not a deep in depth book, I thought he did pretty good. (I have to say he did good because he thinks just like me. lol )Besides he predicted was is now happening on Wall Street to the letter. He seems to know his stuff and doesn't tout himself as being a super intelligent PHDD EEconomic ID alien know-it-all. He simply presents his ideological opinion of the current economic banking system along with the Bible. Yes the bible. He was a banker, congressman and a pretty smart guy to foresee what is now happening on Wall Street. If you have any interest in the markets, this is a must read."
3,"Seemed dated for a ""revised"" edition","The best part of the New Economic Disorder was its review of the world's financial system. Though the book was copyrighted in 2008 and its cover stated it was ""revised and updated,"" the book nonetheless had a rather dated feel to it, with most of the charts, graphs, and financial examples from the early 1990's (more current material should have been used for a ""revised"" edition). There were a few brief references to more recent events, but overall this book seemed like it had been rather hastily cobbled back together from an earlier decade-old edition to capitalize on the current financial meltdown. I never could find the date of the original edition of the book and wonder exactly when it was first published. Not bad as a quick financial overview, but there are better books available if one wishes to understand the causes of our current financial mess (e.g., ""The Coming Generational Storm"" by Kotlikoff & Burns, or ""America's Bubble Economy"" by Wiedemer et al.)."
3,Sounding Board,I was pleased at the Biblical references in the book but I was more interested in suggestions about how to weather the coming crises which Larry Bates FINALLY got around to making. When I googled him I found that he sells some junk at his seminars and that displeased me somewhat.
2,"A better book is ""America's Financial Reckoning Day""","I purchased several books on America's financial situation from Amazon - America's Financial Reckoning Day was the best.The New Economic Disorder just does not compare. The New Economic Disorder gave a general overview and not much of anything else. Whereas America's Financial Reckoning Day gave a very thorough understanding of the history (details, dates and persons) of America's financial situation.The New Economic Disorder had larger fonts, smaller pages and fewer pages. America's Financial Reckoning Day had larger pages, smaller fonts and many more pages.You will not get your monies worth with The New Economic Disorder."
1,Larry Bates is a crook and a fraud,"Larry Bates tricks people into sending in money to buy gold, and then he will no send people the gold they have purchased...don't fall into his trap!!!!!!"
3,A Little Disappointed...,"While the author certainly has a personal history pertinenet to the topic of the book I was disappointed that it did not truly educate people. While he distinctly makes his point about what will be 'needed' monetarily once economic collapse happens, I am sure he has a vast knowledge of how to handle one's finances prior to that time which he did not share. Would not recommend..."
5,The New Economic Disorder,A very informative book and a must read for all concerned Americans who want to know the truth.
5,The New Economic Disorder,I learned a lot; also changed the way I think about our money system.It also changed my life.The book was in very good condition.Had a great price.
4,"Larry is right on,wish there was more info on....","Positives: I just finished reading this book this morning. Larry Bates is spot on in his book. Great background information and details justifying his stance. He also uses scripture to back up some of his claims...that was great.Recommendation: I wish there was at least two chapters (or one really informative chapter) on how to better prepare. For those of us that have been preparing for a while, I really looked forward to him S-P-E-L-L-I-N-G out details of preparation in case there was something I missed. I went through 15 chapters of doom and gloom (which was reality and life as we know it)- I just think people need more info on how to prepare. Some just don't know what and how to go about it. I hope he comes out with another book detailing the how to's for those people that just don't get it. -Overall EXCELLENT book. Recommend for all that can handle the truth."
5,amazon order/delivery,"very timely delivery, terrific price. great book (so far). bought this book because of Larry Bates' experience and because he is a Christian. looking forward to remainder of book."
1,Don't buy this,"This toy looks like it would be fun but it is not a good toy. The lid just falls off, making this the most frustrating toy ever for your baby. If they even lift the box up a little bit to try and fit the shape in, the lid comes right off. My son loves all shape sorting toys but he likes to manipulate the box and turn it around in his hands to find the shapes. Totally unable to do that with this toy. Very disappointed in this, especially with it being a Melissa and Doug toy (I usually love and trust this brand)"
2,Not Up to Melissa & Doug Usual Quality,"I was disappointed that some of the paint had ""bled"" into adjoining spaces, and the wood was very, very rough, rather than the smooth wood I had expected. I was quite disappointed."
1,Splintered and rough wooden edges,"We received this as a gift. The edges of the wooden box were rough, made or cheap wood and splintered. There were splinters sticking out and I would not let my little one play with this. Also in order to get all the shapes in the box you have to shake it, shift it, or let the other shapes out in order to keep playing. I just dont like the design but mostly Im disappointed with the quality of it."
3,I thought this was a great product...,Until I got it delivered. The edges on the shape holes are not sanded well and they splintered immediately since there is a very thin wood veneer on this product. The lid also slides off very easily. I bought a generic plastic one that actually gets more play time than this one does
5,Great toy!,"My toddler has found many fun things to do with this toy. This is one of his favorites. He loves stacking the blocks up to build a tower as high as he can. He is also starting to learn the names of the shapes. He's learned triangle, square, star, oval and said hexagon tonight. I've found this toy to be very durable. He chucked the container portion on our kitchen floor the other day. I thought for sure it was a goner but it just ended up getting a small ding in the corner.Overall this is a great toy and I recommend it!"
3,"melissa & doug are great, but this toy is lacking...","We have tons of Melissa & Doug toys and really are impressed with their overall durability, educational value, and price. However, this is one of the few pieces I would not buy again. The shapes are chunky, varied and colorful, but the design is flawed. It is very difficult for my daughter (received it at one year is now nearly two) to get the shapes in the holes because of the layout. She has other shape sorters that are much more child friendly. Overall this is not an enjoyable toy for her."
3,Shape sorting cube,This is a good educational toy; however it is quite challenging for a 2year old to get the shape into the correct slot. Some of shapes are too similar for example the square and the rectangle. The diamond shape when turned is very similar to the rectangle also. It is somewhat frustrating for a young child. I am sure in another 6 months it may not be. I would purchase this shape sorting cube for an older child.
3,Even hard for me!,"Some of these shapes are so similar that even I have a hard time figuring out which whole they go through! This has been a source of great frustration for my 15 month old but he keeps going back and trying over and over. So, I rate this high on education but low on fun. The lid is hard to put in place, but that too is part of the education I suppose. The materials are all durable and seem well made."
4,fun for a kid,"The paint on the shaped blocks rubs off on theplain wood, so you get little stripes on thecube. It seems to be durable enough and I likethe ""old school"" toys mixed in with the newerones. I think it's a good toy for that."
2,Stupid design,"There's no way to make the lid stay on, so the kid is like ""Hmmm, to get the pieces in the box, just put the pieces in THE GIANT HOLE ON THE TOP. No shape sorting necessary."" Really terrible design."
4,Nice learning toy,very clear and direct to the kid mind.nice way to learn specialy for kids who speaks english as there second language.
1,Top isn't hinged on and bad construction...WOULDN'T BUY AGAIN.,"Melissa and Doug Products could use some work..We bought the shape sorter for christmas and not 2 weeks later the top split. Now there is no top and 3 blocks are basically useless. Also the paint on the blocks doesn't stay on very well. We ordered about ten differen M&D; products and really aren't happy with quality, size or construction. The paints on most of their products is already coming off or chipping away. The wood on some has broken or splintered away. Now I must say our daughter is 11 months old and not rough on any of them.I would be careful if you do purchase and keep plenty of glue around for all the broken pcs."
1,"This toy is frustrating, the lid does not stay on!","I bought this for my son and how the lid is made it does not stay on so that you may turn it to put the different shapes in. Also, when putting shapes in, it gets so full that other shapes will not fit in with out a fight. I would highly recommend tupperware's shape sorter before I would ever buy this one."
1,what is the point?,"My husband and I bought this because it looked great...a wooden shape sorter. Yeah, okay. First the lid doesn't stay on. Second, my 17 month old learned about 5 minutes into playing with it (he started a few months ago), that the blocks don't necessarily have to go into the shape it corresponds with. Now it's pretty much a noise maker. Dump the blocks out and put them back in. Don't waste your child's time with this one...the same thing can be accomplished with some dry pasta and a shoe box with a few holes cut in the side."
1,scary,"my child received this as a gift but i do not recomend you buy this item. is a wooden box with sharp edges, my husband tripped on this box and cut his knee, it has since been away from my son and on a shelf. that's all the use we will be giving to it. just the thought of my child hurting himself with this box scares me."
2,Very difficult - weirdly constructed,"This very difficult shape shorter. I would guess that 3+ is a better age range. The shapes are very similar and sized the same. If I sort them by side my 2yold can do it but he doesn't really enjoy it. We have another that is much more fun.Also, the lid comes off for no reason. I can't see any reason why they would design it this way. At the very least, how about a hinge? Child labor too expensive in China? Like many M&D; toys, you get what you pay for..."
5,Great toy!,"This is a great toy! It's well made and colorful. My son loves it, he likes to use as a shape sorter and he likes to use the shapes as blocks."
5,Excellent toy,I bought this toy couple years ago for my son (he was around 2 that time). It definitely helped him to learn shapes. He could play multiple times a day with this toy never seemed being bored.
3,Disappointed in the quality,"I was expecting a solid, good quality wooden toy. The cube itself is just that. Beautiful, solid wood, well put together. The rest of the toy disappoints, though. The paint on the blocks started chipping the first time we played with them. The lid is made not from the same wood as the rest of the cube but thinner cheaper laminated wood. Where the cut-out holes are, the first laminated layer has chipped away in places. This doesn't prevent the toy from being played with, however, I am much more wary of my daughter trying to put the blocks in her mouth because of the chipped paint, and it's just not going to be as durable as I expected."
5,gift for my neice,"This was a great educational gift for my young neice. She will be able to use this for quite some time, and since it's such a durable toy, it wil lbe very nice to pass along to other family members to come!"
2,"Middling Quality, Middling usefulness","I am not impressed by the quality of Melissa and Doug products, especially compared to brands like Plan. M&D seems to skimp or wood quality and on the objects' finish. This shape sorter compares unfavorable to Plan's 3-shape sort. The M&D sorter arrived cracked. The blocks aren't very smooth and don't feel great in the hand like Plan's do. And more isn't necessarily better. There are lots of shapes here, but our child likes the box better than sorting, while she loves to sort with the Plan sorter. I'd recommend the simpler, elegant Plan sorter over this one. And coupled with what I've seen of M&D products, I'm going to bypass them from now on and spend a few dollars more for toys that will last multiple children (and grandchildren)."
2,Very poorly constructed-- can't believe this was made by beloved Melissa & Doug!,"We usually LOVE Melissa and Doug toys and were so sad that this one didn't work out for us.The concept is fantastic-- a wooden shape sorter that helps with important developmental skills while being eco-friendly and safe for children (no dangerous paints or chemicals).The execution on this item is not good. First, it has very sharp corners and the wood is flimsy. I don't feel comfortable with my toddler playing with this-- too worried he will hurt himself. We have lots of wooden toys, and they all have rounded corners and a soft finish. But this shape sorter is rough and not well made. The wood is thin and cheap. It looks and feels very cheap.Second, the shapes and colors are so similar to each other that its easy to get confused. The designers should have put more thought into use of colors and shapes.A disapointment for us."
3,Add your own velcro to hold the lid on,Great toy except for the lid not attached. Simple solution - self adhesive velcro in the 4 notches. Worked for us like a charm!
2,Poor design,"I should have heeded the warning of other reviewers. Could the design be any poorer. There are two plain sides, and one of those couldn't be the opening???? While my 21 month old tries to put shapes in the top, it slide about.Also, I'd pay attention to the comments about the shape similarity. While I want this to be challenging for my child, I don't want it to be frustrating. Not the best $$$ I've ever spent."
5,"Great toy, solidly built",We love this toy for our 2 1/2 year old. He is into shapes and loves to find the holes to put them in. It is a great step up toy to the plastic 5 shape hole bucket.
4,Fun learning toy...,"A fun toy for learning shapes and puzzle solving, or for simply playing with the blocks themselves. The solid wood blocks are sturdy and fun to stack and dump in and out of the box itself."
2,splinters and poor quality,"I loved the idea of a wooden toy - durable, high quality, etc. I have gotten my daughter a number of toys from various wooden toy makers and European toy makers. I ordered this shape sorter and am not happy with the product. The newer version (we got this for Xmas 2012) has a plywood box, and it is unfinished. I don't have a problem with unfinished wood or plywood, except many of the box's edges (outside and within the shape holes themselves) are poorly cut and VERY jagged. It is unpleasant to touch, but the biggest problem of course is that it can give you splinters. SPLINTERS! Really, Melissa and Doug? Have you downgraded your quality so much in favor of upping your profit? I won't be ordering again."
2,WHY????,Why would this company make the square/rectangle holes so big that every other shape can fit into them. I bought this so my son could learn shapes and now he thinks that all shapes fit in sqauare holes. This toy was a huge disappointment. The quality of the product looks top notch but when you use it you feel robbed!
1,Unfortunately not up to LCI standards,"I love LCI products.. especially their fuzzy puzzzles :)However, this one doesn't live up to my expectationsProblems:1) The top doesn't stay on. What's the point if you can't put all of the shapes in. When you turn it the top falls off and the shapes fall out. It's not even hinged.2) There are some pieces that will fit through the wrong hole."
1,Junk,"What a waste of wood. The lid falls off when you turn it to put peices in the side. I can't believe Lights, Camera, Interaction made this."
3,12-piece wooden shape sorting cube,"Great for developmental play for the early toddler and preschooler, however, the cube does not close so peices are constantly falling out and getting lost."
1,"Very poor quality, DANGEROUS","Unfortunately, I bought this toy on a whim at the store when I usually read reviews first and I highly regret it. This product is of very poor quality. We have owned it for 2 days. Like others have said, the lid is too easy to remove and just slides right out by merely turning the cube. Not too much of an issue (right now anyway) because my kid is of an age where she just likes to remove the shapes from the box and not put them back. What concerns me the most though are the splinters. Mine has splinters of a good enough size that they could be a choking hazard on in addition to ""just"" poking into skin. The box is just splintering off around the shape holes. I took this immediately away from my child. Too bad. I'm going to try and return it."
1,Poor Design,"I usually like Melissa and Doug, but this is a very poorly designed product. The box is made with shapes on five sides, obviously to play you should be able to turn the box at different angles. But the lid just sits on top, so it falls off if you turn it. It's a useless box with shapes cut in it, waste of money."
3,"Wood is better than plastic, but...","I was thrilled to find this Wooden Shape Sorting Cube so it could replace our plastic one. When it came, however, I immediately thought of putting hinges and a snap or closure device on the cover so that we couldn't misplace the top and so that kids could use the top shape sorting panel just as easily as the other sides and that it would remain one whole block. Within the first week my two year old split the cover - it is too week with the shapes cut out of a single unsupported piece. We suspect he either hit it with his toy hammer or steped on it. We're going to have to gorilla glue it so he can play with it again. Conceptually it is wonderful - an oldie but a goodie! Structurally, it could use some work."
3,nice price for the product,My son loves this toy. The main problem is that the removable side (used to retrieve the shapes) falls off all the time. It would have been perfect if the top fitted tight enough to stay when the box was turned.
4,"Despite other reviews, MY kids like this one a lot!","My kids (girl ages 2-1/2 and boy 1-1/2) have had lots of fun with this toy. The older (girl) got it when she was about a year old. The only negative I have observed with their play is that sometimes when the shapes have collected at the bottom of the toy they preclude/obstruct adding other shapes into the box. As for the top coming off, that hasn't seemed to bother the kids at all. It IS a more advanced shape sorter, but since we already had a simple ""3-shape"" sorter toy it has been a fun challenge for the children.(Added 2 years later: My kids are now 3-1/2 and 4-1/2 and they still from time to time pick this one up and play with it. WOW!)"
4,fun for toddler,"My two-and-a-half year old son loves this toy! However, I bought this for him when he was one-and-a-half and, unfortunately, he broke the top.The top of the block is definitely flimsy and breaks easily. My husband super-glued it, and, so far, it's staying together.My son loved fitting the shapes into the holes when he was a little younger and now loves it because he's learning the names of the shapes. This is a toy that has grown with him.What more can you ask?A little more durable maybe?"
3,12 piece wooden shape sorting cube,"This item is durable and educational, but not the quality I would give for a gift. It is not made in an attractive format that my little ones were enthusiastic about. By the ime a I paid the postage and cost of the item, it was too costly to send back."
4,loose lid,I love the colors of the blocks and the unique shapes. My son plays with the toy occasionally but only because he is still a bit too young (14 months old) to appreciate the shape sorting. I do wish the lid was attachable and I actually put strips of velcro on it to keep it in place as my son turns it upside down.
4,"A Little Complicated, but fun","I got this toy for my 2 year old son. A few of the shapes are very similar so I had to help guide him on some of them, but when he got one in the correct place he was so proud. We have only had it for a short while, but I think it is going to be a great teaching tool for my son. He likes all of the different colors as well. I would recommend this toy to parents of 2 year olds and above."
1,Bad Choice,"I purchased this toy thinking like everyone else that it seemed great in the box. However, outside the box it is useless. The top does not stay on. I called Melissa & Doug and informed them of the flaw in the product. They explained that they did not attach the cover out of fear of little fingers being caught in the ""door"" when child tries to close the top. I am still sure there are work arounds. I personally LOVE Melissa & Doug products, but NOT this product. They have a great customer service!"
5,Shape sorting cube a hit!,This sorting cube has one side of the cube that slides in and out so you can turn it on it's side without the side flopping open! Wonderfully sized pieces for my 1 year old. We love this toy here!!!
5,"Great shape sorter, takes time to learn","I was surprised about the low ratings of this sorter, but went ahead and purchased it anyway as I like Melissa & Doug and I like wooden toys. Once the item arrived and I gave it to my baby, he didn't know what to do with it (at 10 months). Now at 11 months he puts the pieces into an open box, I put one and he puts one etc. The lid is sturdy on the item I received, so I don't envisage it to become a problem in the future once we start putting pieces into the designated holes; the box also fits all pieces fine. I forsee this toy to be much fun for a long time, in fact after getting pieces into this box my boy has started to collect items on the floor and put them into other boxes/baskets."
4,A Classic Toy,"Our two little girls love this toy. It's a great learning tool for our youngest, who is 2yo right now. The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because, like so many wooden toys, there are sharp edges on the box I believe could have been filed down for added safety. This product is geared toward toddlers, so there is added risk for injury. Ours is put up when they are not playing with it so no one will fall on it."
2,Skip this toy,"Skip this shape sorter. The lid falls off, and there isn't enough room in the cube for all of the shapes. There are a lot better shape sorters out there."
4,Nice,"Very nice item, My 3 year old found the different shapes a challenge and my 2 year old just got confused and frustrated. the lid is an issue for sure. would rather it was a lifted one with a magnet catch or something.."
1,Doesn't work,We agree with the other reviews- the lid doesn't stay on and the shapes go through any hole and fall out all the time. Unfortunately we're going back to our plastic one that is more functional!
5,great toy!!,"We love this toy for our 2 yr old niece. She is learning colors and shapes. I love hearing her say octagon, etc... It is one of the few toys that actually keeps her quiet and entertained for a while. Once we showed her they all fit and she could have success she was hooked! Very durable and the colors do not bleed at all.Great toy Great price! I can see it will last for years and be a perfect hand me toy in the future without looking beat up."
1,Ouch! Splinters!,"Fortunately (?) the splinters went into my hand and not my daughter's. I've had this problem with several M & D products. The unfinished wood is truly just that--not adequately sanded or in any way sealed. We had problems with splinters from this toy and a couple of puzzles. I wish I could love Melissa and Doug, but so far I've just found them to be dangerous and painful."
2,Just okay.,"I love that this is made of wood. The shapes are sturdy and chunky, just like they should be, but the box is not sturdy at all. The base of the box split at the seams after three days of barely playing with it. The top slides off way too easily so when my daughter turns it around/upside down to find the right side for the shape, it often slides opens and spills everything out, which is frustrating for both of us. Also, it's pretty challenging for my 22 month-old. There are absolutely no clues to help find the right hole like other shape sorters have, such as color coding or texture on the box. My daughter is basically uninterested in playing with it and I wouldn't buy it again."
2,Poorly designed Shape Sorter,"We bought this for our 19 month old because we love the idea of well made wood toys, and she needed a good shape sorter.This seems to be both of those at first glance. However, when you watch how the kids use this, you realize that they are not learning much. Most of the shapes fit through the hole corresponding to another shape. For instance, the long triangle slides easily through the circle's hole.Perhaps an older child that knows that you only score points when you play by the rules would be able to use this as intended. Otherwise, my child uses the basic Fisher Price plastic shape sorter (4 shapes, each goes in only if placed in the right hole). That taught her what shape sorters are meant to, and she's very good at it!This toy ends up being quite confusing; so other than the colorful, well-made pieces being used for parent-child play and instruction (or as projectiles), the toy ends up rather neglected."
2,Tossed shortly after purchase,"This item was purchased for a 1 1/2 yr old. He and I found it very frustrating that the lid kept coming off. He did enjoy putting the shapes in the blocks and learned a little from the cube, however his joy over building with Mega Lego Blocks delivered the cube it's short lived welcome."
3,Better options out there,"We purchased this toy and I have to say that there are better choices out there for shape sorters. I think there are a couple flaws:1. too many choices/shapes. Some pieces are about the same ""general"" shape, which confuses little ones. Less complicated = better for young ages.2. the lid comes off pretty easy, which makes it hard and frustrating for infants.Not impressed with this one..."
2,"Looks good, but poor design for actual use","I commend Melissa and Doug for the nice variety of shapes this cube offers as well as its classic wooden toy appearance, but that being said, actual use of this cube is cumbersome and faulty. A bit too heavy for tiny hands to turn and look for the appropriate hole, it also becomes frustrating when the lid falls off (no latch or hinge to keep it on) or it is almost full with blocks and you are trying to push in one of the shapes in the lower portion of the cube and it won't go in because there are blocks inside sitting on the bottom. If the lid latched, you could turn the sides facing up and easily insert the shapes, but not so. I sold my daughter's on ebay and got her the classic plastic Playskool one that has a snap lid and that is lighter weight so she can turn and tumble, looking for the right hole for the shape she has."
2,Don't waste your money!,I agree with the last reviewer...the lid does not lock down-I have it collecting dust on the shelf- I like the idea that it was wood and it is made to last but they should have put a locking lid to keep the shapes in all one piece and so the child can pick up the box with out having the lid fall off.
1,bad,"I wish I could have given this item 0 stars...what a waste of money. The lid doesn't stay on, the pieces fit in multiple spots there are enough great shape sorters out there that you don't need to buy this one"
3,what a mess,"My son is 2 1/2 years old and we bought this for him last Christmas (2001). We were looking for something along this line and being from Imaginarium I thought it would be good. There's a major error in the design of the toy. The blocks fit in numerous different holes so there's no reason to find the correct hole to put the correct shape in. The rectangle turned sideways fits in at least 3 or 4 different holes.So, as a learning toy there are other sorting blocks that are much better. My son has more fun throwing the blocks around. He loves to put the blocks in the holes and he does enjoy the toy. It is well made and sturdy, but as an educational toy it is lacking."
4,good,"good quality (but I need to sand it down better myself so baby gets no slivers)lots of colors and shapes, and a shape cheat sheet on the bottom."
3,I wanted to like this more..,"Ok. So I liked how it was wooden and not plastic. However, it was hard for my kids to do some of the shapes. I usually love M&D toys but this one I would pass on."
1,careful,The shape sorter is really cute but the edges are sharp and the paint in the shapes came off on my daughter. She only played with it once and I had to get rid of it. Be careful with this toy. I would nit purchase it for a child under three.
2,poorly made,We played with this toy once and the lid will NOT fit back on and now all the wood on the sides and everywhere is cracking. Waste
2,Lid doesn't stay on!,"My twins love shape sorter toys. Once my kids figured out how easily the top lid came off, that was the end of it! They are no longer interested in figuring out the shapes; they only want to lift off the lid and throw the blocks in it! The lid doesn't lock in or anything.Basically, don't waste your money on this one; there are better ones out there."
2,not great,"there are blocks that are almost the same shape as others; it would be difficult for a young toddler to figure this out. heck, it takes me a minute to do it. the corners are not rounded, so there are sharp wood corners!!"
2,Good for older children,"I thought my twins would love this shape sorter because they love their plastic one. Since it has so many shapes I thought it would be a lot more useful than the plastic one that only has four. Here's a tip, make sure your chid is older than 3 before using this toy. Younger ones want to put the pieces and the lid in their mouth. My daughter got a splinter in her gums from chewing on the lid. Also, it's really hard for toddlers. The shapes are poorly cut so it's not obvious that a parallelogram hole should fit the awkward looking chunk that is supposed to be a 3D parallelogram."
3,Maybe she'll like it more when she's older,"My 1.5 year old just isn't captivated by this toy. Also, some of the shapes are just a tad too big for the holes so it's hard to push them through. Also, the shape openings on the box are lightly peeling a little but. Not a problem, but I wasn't too happy about little pieces of wood coming off it. I pulled them off and no problems so far. Maybe she'll like it more when she gets older. As shape sorters go, this is a nice one."
1,Bad design and construction,"This cube is badly designed - the shapes are too similar so it is very difficult for my 20 month old to find the right slot. In addition, other shape sorters use color coding on the cube to help find the right slot, this one doesn't. The lid won't stay on, it slides off when the box is turned over. As it has to slide on my toddler (who adores putting lids on and off boxes) can't put it on himself and gets very frustrated. It is made of wood, but it is cheap MDF and poorly constructed. There are much better shape sorters on the market."
2,"Cute, but not sturdy or safe","A cute, fun toy. But the wood is so flimsy! It just peels apart. My son has brought me pieces of wood which he has easily broken off and chewed. Any curious toddler could tear it apart or snap the lid in half. We've had this toy for about two months, and there are several pieces of wood missing. They're sharp, too. Buy a better shape sorter. Plastic would probably be best. I'm wishing I'd bought the tupperware one. Oh well."
4,The way toys aught to be made,"This is a well made, sturdy toy. The shapes are brightly coloured and attractive to children.I was nearly put off by the bad reviews regarding the lid. But my nearly two-and-a-half year old has no problem with it. He fits in the shapes on the sides first and finally searches for the ones on the lid.He enjoys the easy opening and closing and likes to tip out all the blocks when he has finished.Guest's children have also enjoyed this toy.Thank God there are still companies willing to make good quality products.A parent tired of poorly made, cheap toys."
2,Great Idea..poorly designed,"When I had this on our wish list, there were no reviews written about it. When we received it as a Christmas present, we were excited to let our daughter play with it. As soon as we opened it, we couldn't figure out why the lid didn't stay on. You can't turn it without all the blocks falling out! Our daughter still likes to play with it, but it's frustrating for adults because of the terrible design. True, there also some holes that most of the blocks fit through regardless of their shape! I WOULD NOT purchase this...there are many superior products on the market!"
3,OK toy,The side panel that slides off & isn't as sturdy as I've come to expect of M&D toys. It already has a crack in panel & it may have already happened when the toy was delivered to us because it seemed to be there when it arrived but I don't know for sure. There's one shape that fits into 2 different shapes and sometimes it's confusing to our child as we are trying to teach the different shapes.
1,"I love Melissa & Doug toys, but this is a big disappointment","I ditto the majority of the reviews of this toy. Although I really like most of the Melissa & Doug toys, I cannot figure out how this one is still on the market...Again, the fact that the lid will not stay on makes the toy nearly useless. The child cannot turn the cube in any direction to find the proper hole for the shape,and if she does, the top falls off or the block falls out. What is the point? It becomes just another box to keep blocks in.My 21 month old daughter simply takes the blocks and dumps them in other containers, it is completely useless as a shape sorter...I have to say it was a big waste of money, unlike the other toys by this manufacturer."
1,Disappointing for sorting intentions,"This toy just sets a kid up to fail. So many great shapes, but so useless for all the reasons already stated--the top comes right off and the pieces fall out as you turn the box. My 20 month old son does enjoy stacking the shapes. I have now put the box away so he doesn't get frustrated at not succeeding."
1,"lid falls off, what more to say?","A complete waste of money -- the child cannot manipulate the cube to look at different sides, because there is no latch that holds the lid on! It simply falls off, and all the shape blocks fall out, too. Very angry to have purchased this. What a ripoff."
3,So-so,I read these reviews before I bought this toy so I knew that the lid didn't stay on and I bought it anyway. Another problem about this is that the shapes don't all fit in the toy easily. You have to shake the toy (and hold the lid) to move the other shapes out of the way for the other ones to fit in properly. I would look for a different shape sorter if I were buying a new one. It IS very durable though.
3,longer-term effects,"My daughter got this at 9 months. We played with it a little. Six months later, it was still in use, but not much. Now, she's about to turn 5 yrs and still plays with it intermittently, as well as mixing these blocks with other wooden blocks and using the box as a foundation for towers.At 3-4 yrs old, she was much more intent on finding the matching hole than at 1-2 yrs. Now, she manipulates her doll to put the blocks in.The plastic shape-sorters? They've been ignored since 18 months. I suspect bad reviews come because the toy is a little too complicated for an infant's first shape-sorter."
2,more difficult than it looks,"I picked up one of these shape sorters for my son, who loves puzzles, when he was two. He definitely was interested in it but more often than not ""cheated"" by putting a piece in the wrong hole by twisting it, or opening the top and dropping it in. His occupational therapist said this puzzle is far more difficult than it looks because of the many surfaces on each block. We put a sticker on one of the surfaces that should face out when you position the block properly and that helped my son figure out how to put the blocks in the right way. Still, I think they should have thought out the design a bit more."
1,They Missed The Point,Very Cute.Doesn't work.My son puts any shape he wants into any hole which defeats the purpose of the toy. The best shape sorter I had was a clear bucket with 4 basic shapes on the top - I gave it away but wish I could find that one again for my 2nd child. I'm giving this toy away too though I feel badly about offering a toy that does not work as it is intended.
2,Well this is a good makeshift shape sorter...,"my kid however, lost the lid to it within a couple days and then it's pretty much a glorified basket!To each their own!"
4,Ken's so cool,"This is Ken Nordine we're talking about. What's not to love? I do like his longer form pieces better (hence the four stars not five) but this one is full of short and snappy stuff. Okay, four and a half stars."
2,Too Many Preservatives,Looked like a good product but I would not order it again. There are way too many chemicals in it. Are these folks unaware of how bad parabens are for health? They should change the name from NaturVet to ChemVet.
1,Won't play,Defective disc.. stops playing after a few minutes. Waste of money. Too bad as I loved the show as a kid.
5,Have a 4 and 6 year old at home?????,I remember watching Speed Racer when it first came out. I was 4 years old. My two boys are now Speed Racer junkies. They have worn out this DVD. I even had to shell out 12 bucks for a Mach 5 Hotwheel.It's great for kids. They don't make cartoons like this anymore.
4,"Great series, but a few problems","It's great to finally see this released on DVD. The picture quality is great. The sound is mono, but in it's own way adds to the memories of the original series. I had a slight problem with the following:1. No chapter selections within each episode. Once you select an episode you're stuck with using FF or going back to the main menu.2. The end credits are not original. Nitpicking I know, but if you are going to give us the original, make it all original.Having said the above, the stories are still fresh. It was fun watching and remembering sitting in front of the old black and white waiting for the next episode. Can't wait for the next volume."
2,OK; Should be Better,"The quality of the video and audio is great -- much better than I've seen on video tapes (most of which were recorded at EP speed). But it's pretty [bad] that they changed the graphics for the opening, and even [worse]that some of the episodes are recorded at the wrong speed -- they play a little fast (you can tell because the voices on those episodes are higher pitched, as is the theme song). That's bad.Also bad is the misspelling of Jack Grimes' name as one of the voices. On the videotapes, it is correctly spelled Grimes; on the DVD it is Crimes. That, along with the fast playback on some of the episodes shows that little care was used in putting this DVD together. Family Home Entertainment should be ashamed. I expect more."
4,Love this series,"Brought back younger days"". I really enjoyed this one. It brought back younger days. I know that now I got to buy the other season DVD. They still are really entertaining to watch. And it still have the old feel of it."
3,"Nice, yet disappointing","Although it's nice to be able to see the Speed Racer episodes I enjoyed as a child, the quality of the video on this DVD is extremely disappointing. The video is obviously compressed and looks terrible. I guess the producers of the DVD figured that nobody would notice if they saved on production costs by compressing all of the video onto a single disc. Even though it's a cartoon, the image degradation is very apparent. I'm hoping that someone brings a better version to market in the future."
5,Speed kills.....,"I am so pleased to have Speed Racer back in my life, and especially in the life of my 3 year old son. I don't imagine there are many really young Speed fans anymore. How sad. We were even able to get him toy Mach 5 cars and he knows all the characters. This DVD is a great way to re-introduce yourself or your children to this great series. I wish and hope that more episodes will become available. The only downside is a sparse list of extras on the DVD. I hope that the company owning this franchise will see that there is still a demand for this great show and for related projects.On a side note, Speed Racer items are available at the official Speed Racer web site. Ebay carries a number of Speed Racer items also, including the Japan-only Hot Wheels Mach 5.The only hard part is, do I buy for my son to play with or for me to collect!"
2,Where's The Japanese?,"It shows they did not put much effort into this remastering if they couldn't include the original Japanese language track. Absolutely a crime to not do so in my opinion. Dubbing movies and television shows into another language is possibly the worst thing that happened to movies, and this is no exception. (Sorry people who never saw the original series living on nostalgia, but it's true.) Also, many scenes were cut for the American broadcast for 'violence'. So please, why the edited version on DVD? 2 giant reasons not to buy this set, but if you're a collector and want a rubber tire for your DVD collection, I can't stop you. But you have been warned along with countless others giving this DVD a mediocre review."
3,Cool for a 1st grader,"I really dug Speed Racer when I was in 1st grade, it had the coolest car, Racer-X was mysterious, and Trixie was hot. Having seen it again years later as an adult, It was fun to watch, but I'm not sure I can sit through more than a couple of episodes. I gave it to my girlfriend's son who is 4 and he appreciates it far more than I do now. I look forward to the live action version by the Wachowski brothers. However, one critique after seeing a still of the movie car, the camber is totally off on the wheels for the Mach 5 to make it effective in the corners. I'm just saying, not even Michael Schumacher could win a race with that much postive camber."
2,Disappointed,"As a minister, I was hoping to find some stories here that I could re-tell. Times have changed, I guess. Many of the stories seemed too long to use today. Some were boring, others dated. Only a couple seemed suited to the Christmas season (which was what I was especially looking for).The back story on the author (a Huguenot minister in France, during WW II) is powerful. He was a faithful, inspiring, and courageous pastor. No doubt the stories he told were deeply moving to his parishioners. But IMO they are not very useful to pastors today. In themselves, they are probably not of much interest to most readers. I would much rather tell a story ABOUT the author, than a story BY the author.Angels and Donkeys: Tales for Christmas and Other Times."
4,Cool!,"I owm this case, and have for a while now. It is a good product and the only reason I am getting a new one is because I need more ports for peripherals."
4,Great idea if a wedding is coming up. . .,"My little flower girls thought this doll was great. They were in a family member's wedding and Jennibelle was the perfect fit to their new experience! Of course, with her pretty veil and gloves, she is really cast in the wedding party. But they don't mind."
5,Love the groovy girls Jennibelle.,My 3 year old grandaughter is going to be a flower girl in a wedding and I thought this little doll would be a perfect gift to give her. She can play with it on the plane going to the wedding!I'm sure she'll LOVE it!Many thanks!!!
1,NOT HAPPY,"FIRST ..amazon doesn't tell you the measurments of this doll...looks rather big infact its a small barbie size doll,i feel i was over charged for this item as i thought it would be bigger,bought for my 2 flowers girls which i need tonight(GOOG THING IS IT CAME JUST IN TIME) but i was complety embarrsed to give them this small thing as there gift! if i didnt need IT WOULD HAVE GONE BACK.TOO MUCH MONEY FOR A BARBIE SIZE DOLL THAT LOOKS ALOT BIGGER!..i usally have no issues with amazon,very unhappy this time..this will give me a reason to rethink useing them"
4,Entertaining Read,"Having lived during this historic time, I thoroughly enjoyed the story and all the of the characters. The book does a great job of describing Marilyn Monroe. No one else has ever come close to her. The authors may have been overly generous in characterizing Nikita Khrushchev as having a soft side. No matter, they have gathered much research and created a marvelous story with treachery, humor, suspense, and a host of famous celebrities."
3,Bombshell,"This book is actually based on history Interesting to learn what happened, and how we American people, are often kept in the dark."
2,Cute but lightweight,"It's a quick read for an airplane ride or weekend by the pool. Really wish an editor had pointed out to the authors that every third sentence has a bad cliche. Reads like a first time novelist wanting to capitalize on MM's enduring fascination to us. However, the story is direct and doesn't insult with plot holes."
4,Not a lot of Cash,"It has been awhile since I watched this concert. There is one thing that sticks out in my mind: there were probably only four Johnny Cash songs. The rest of the songs were guest singers. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it. I was just hoping for more of the man in black, himself."
3,Maybe...,Maybe this was a bit scary for my 8-year-old to watch but she watched it anyway. She loves anything and everything dinosaurs!
4,Good show,"Ok, you are just here to have fun. The premise of pre historic animals coming through a portal into our time is just fun. A British program with truly good acting."
5,Awesome show!,"This show was fantastic! If anyone wanted to watch Terra Nova for the dinosaurs, watch this show! The British show has a great cast, great story line and there's never a dull moment. I sincerely hope they renew for a Season 6 because it is too good to leave behind. They did a great job with the CGI and the acting is quite believable, one of the best sci-fi series I've had the chance to watch."
5,Can't wait to see more,Great show well thought out excellent story lines and great characters get you thinking while you enjoy a good story looking for more
1,same as volume 3,This is the same as the second half of volume 3. and it is not for use in the US. when I plugged it in it shut down my player
5,PRIMEVAL 5,"WE WERE SORRY TO SEE IT END. BUT IT WAS FOR FREE UNTIL SEASON 5, THEN THERE WAS A 1.99 CHARGE, PER SHOW. SO WE SWITCH OVER TO UTUBE AND WATCHED IT FOR FREE. BUT WE WILL MISS SEEING THIS SHOW. CAN IT COME BACK."
1,Primeval 5,Disappointed. Was not informed it was not for my region 1. It needs to be more clearly stated what regions these movies were for. I will have to return it
4,Primeval is a great show,"I really like this show.Season 5 is rather short though,may be the end of the series.More political intrigue and such.I didnt like the 1800's woman brought into the show, the whole ""Jack the Ripper"" thing has been done to death.That plot may have started in season 4. All in all I liked this series but it is now on streaming netflix right after I Paid for seasons 4 & 5-like 2 weeks later.That stung a bit but Amazons picture and sound were very good.Netflix is always good too."
5,Super Egos and Super Beetles,"Connor and Philip create a man made anomoly never considering the consequences. Enter super beetles from the future that can eat through concrete and wiring as they munch their way through the ARC and out into the underground parking garage. As the ARC team tries to contain the disaster, Philip demands that Connor keep sending data from his made made anomoly. Connor begins to have second thoughts about his work with Philip, but realizes he may be too late to change the man made catastrophe Matt came to stop."
3,About 3 seconds of silence between songs,"The songs are good but I bought the cd for a 50's dance party but cannot use it because of the longgggg silence between each song (about 3 - 4 seconds)...which is an eternity if you think of people standing on the dance floor in complete silence! Not sure why it's a ""dance"" cd but has pauses...hmmmm. I'm not sure why ""Ain't that a shame""(mellow song) and ""The Rock and Roll Waltz"" (really slow) are on a dance cd...all the rest of the songs are really upbeat and I could think of a hundred other uptempo songs they could have used instead of these two."
3,Disappointed for the most part,"It contained a lot of good songs, but some of the songs were so hard to listen to that we stopped playing it after to the first playing."
1,you sent me the wrong CD,"I would have enjoyed my order if you had sent me the one I requested: Chart Toppers - Romantic Hits -50's/dp/B0000060m4; instead you sent me Chart Toppers -Dances of the -50's. Your return policy wasn't convenient. I think you owe me the correct item;will return other,but opened if you provide mailer. I ordered the romantic hits specifically for one track something Santos. Thanks for asking, but I don't want to order more since the first time you didn't send me what I ordered, and that was a real bummer.Sincerely,Theodore L. Wood"
4,Another Great Thriller!,"These Dolly books are hard to find, but worth the effort. This one is an extremely whimsical story about a very talented trained Nanny. Oh how we all would love to have a Maggie Bee Nanny looking after our children. Every time I read a new selection in this series, I can't help thinking how good they would be if done in film. The stories are fast-moving, funny with lots of suspense. The characters that are in each book are wonderful. In this one we encounter Eskimos, anthropologists, a millionaire toy manufacturer, and lots of wonderful children and babies - and of course the inimitable Johnson Johnson. We also travel all over the place - Winnipeg Canada in the dead of winter, New york and Yugoslavia. We also see more of Dolly in this series. For those in the know, Dolly is a 52 foot luxury yacht. These books are a lot of fun to read, and I will be sorry when I've read my way through them all."
2,Dolly and the Nanny Bird,"Interesting diversion on Dorothy Dunnett's part, to her historical fiction, but for me not nearly as compelling,good,or wonderful as the historical novels Anthea Buchanan"
4,multipurpose instrumental music,"This is an album so non-contextual that it can enhance any activity -- sort of a sonic Mrs. Dash. It puts one at ease; it's not romantic, wistful, aggressive, preachy, topical, danceable, or pretentious. It's even interesting enough on a musical level to cause you to rethink your whole attitude on the use of pinball machines as percussion instruments. Also well-suited to accompany a make-out session with that special someone, even if they're not inflatable."
4,Lounge music in a constantly shifting alternate universe,"Instrumental lounge music that is changing and unusual enough to pique the interest of more sophisticated listeners. Sort of like dub, but with enough attention to design and production to keep you off balance at all times.Quirky, enjoyable, unusual are all epithets I would apply. You may not be moved to ecstasy or tears, nor will you see a vision of the Divine, but you and your friends will find your chatter pleasantly stimulated enough that this may become the album you reach for when socializing."
5,good value for the money,"bought these shoes about a year and half ago to play cricket, they've held up VERY good. They've stood up good to the wear and tear of playing games as well as weekly practice sessions. worth a guy definitely."
5,Collectors Edition William Bell,Very Satisfied with with CD and the shipping process. I received my item in 3 business days.
3,Norton Blade,"Better than the blade that came with my wet saw, good all around value for the money. There are better, but obviously for more money."
3,Sophmoric but entertaining.,"This book had a catchy title and cover. That is what initially enticed me. Once I read the synopsis, I was into it even more. Sometimes you need a light and entertaining read. This book is great for that. I thought the character development was poor but the overall ensemble and the switching from piece to piece helped keep you from getting too bored with one piece of the plot. Overall this is not a bad book, It's just not one you'll call a classic."
5,A REAL GOOD READ !!!,"I like the way Jeff sets up situations for his characters in this novel, making it fresh, witty, entertaining & truthful at the same time. Good Work !!"
5,When you're in your twenties - and want not to feel alone...,"READ THIS BOOK.Forget the above hooey about characterization and other literary technique evaluation. If you're reading books and dissecting them for their composition then you probably don't enjoy many books. If you're reading books looking for something to identify with then THIS is your book.This book was excellent, full of at least one or two characters that anybody could identify with. It's been a long time since I read this book, but all I know is that when I read this book, I found it to be the most vivid book I'd read in a long while... the text reads almost like you're watching a movie.But what else can I say? If you're stumbling through your life wondering what a 20 year old is supposed to do -- read this book... maybe you'll get inspired."
1,If I could have given this book zero stars I would have.,"This book is utter crap. From a pure storytelling point of view it lacks everything one learns about in 5th grade composition class. Content-wise, it is a joke. (Case in point: Jeff Gomez seems to be the only person in the western hemisphere who is unaware that a VW Bug's engine is in the REAR of the vehicle.) Just reading the first sentence of each chapter, anyone could guess the ultimate outcome of that particular ""plot-lette,"" since Mr. Gomez's cliche-meter was apparently out of order when he wrote this uninspired, insipid fleck of drivel. One wonders how he was engaged to write a sequel to this! And anyone who has to drop the names of that many indie bands in one book is obviously shooting their wad all at once. This will go down as my pick for the least-literate, worst-written piece of writing of all time."
3,Got some time to kill?,"Not a bad effort, but really no characters I could sink my teeth into. It's a great concept. Follow a band once they get back from a drawn-out tour, not a bad idea. I just kept waiting and waiting for something, anything, to happen. I was filled with promise at the start, but felt cheated in the end."
1,Similar To A Train Wreck,"Unfortunately the topics approached in the book are things that I have in common in my life. I have been a musician, an owner and producer of a very independent record label, employee of a record store, and a fan. The only one of those subjects Jeff Gomez seems to have in common is the fan. Every perspective of his writing is from the view of a fan who has never even remotely lived the experience, but only thinks he relates because he likes a bands songs. If he had written a book about being a a very excited fan I would have been more interested. The only characters that seem even slightly tolerable are the two guys trying to start a zine, probably because that's the only thing in the book Gomez has any experience at.The whole experience was like witnessing a train wreck, I wanted to stop but I just couldn't look away."
1,all noise and no substance,"Definitely one of the worst novels I've ever read, and believe me, I'm usually not this critical. ""Our Noise"" was obviously meant to cash in on the Generation X trend of the early nineties. In any other circumstance it would have no place being published. There basically is no story, no interesting characters, no writing skill, and no point. The characters are just there to fit every indie cliche - the local band, the fanzine maker, the record label guy, etc. etc. And yes, surprise, they are all angsty about their small town existence and mainstream culture in general. I get the feeling that Jeff Gomez wrote this book for no other reason than for an opportunity to namedrop all his favorite (semi-obscure) bands and labels to prove his indie cred. Sad."
2,But why did I read the whole thing?,"I barely made it through the first chapter of this book a year or so ago, noticing the same things everyone else has (shallowest characters ever, needless posturing). Then I forgot all about it. However, I recently picked it up again 'cause it was there. The first thing I realized is that there were way too many lame people to keep track of. If Gomez would have chosen to dedicate some character development to four or five people instead of spreading himself too thin, then maybe I would have found these people more intriguing. In his defense, I did read the whole thing. And there were the rare occasional cultural references that clicked; unfortunately, they were overshadowed by the multitude of lame ones. It's sort of sad that the only thing I come away with after reading this novel is that you don't have to be a genius writer to land a book deal. I guess that's not a terrible lesson to learn. I won't be buying the sequel."
1,Drivel,"What a waste of a promising storyline. I, like many other twenty-somethings with dead-end jobs and too much education, can, in theory, idetify very strongly with Gomez's characters. But these personas are flat and uninteresting, and reading about them takes more effort than it is worth. The dialogue is pathetic, and the irritatingly glossy description painful and transparant. Save your money for your next box of Mac and Cheese."
1,embarrassingly bad,"this is possibly the worst book i've ever read merely because it's trying so, so hard to be ""cool."" i couldn't stand the constant barrage of gratuitous pop culture and music references (and yes, i got them). it was almost fascinating to read just to try and figure out what the author, not to mention the editor, could possibly have been thinking. no character development, no plotline...a whole lot of nothing going on."
1,Not the best book in the World,"Let me say how dissapointed I was when I read this book. I had already read his second book, Genuises of Crack, and loved it, so I was all to eager to read this one. WRONG!! The book was very slow going, the charecters made no sense and the story was just plain boring. My advice, go read something else."
2,Perhaps not the worst book I've ever read....,"As intriguing as the synopses make ""Our Noise"" sound, I found myself unbelievably disappointed with what I read. A few of the characters are amusing, but the writing itself, with its tired metaphors and 'look how hip I am, I know who the Blake Babies are' style, falls far flat. While it may describe a small-town indie scene, I couldn't help but find it completely unrealistic. What's worse, there is ultimately no plot resolution... What is Gomez trying to tell us? Not a clue. There must certainly be better books out there in this same vein...""Our Noise"" is mildly humorous storytelling at its worst."
3,Nice quality poor fit,The bench seat cover does not fit nearly as well as the bucket seat covers. The quality is still good though.
1,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed when this book arrived...I had googled for a ""kids'"" version for a GBOWR....I work with school children. I was expecting a book with color pictures, larger print, etc. I received a 1980 paperback, yellowed pages, smelling slightly musty...tiny print...certainly NOT a kid friendly book! Will not buy from this site again!"
3,A History of Boeing,"A fine brushstroke look at how Boeing got started, the men who built the company and its entry into the jet age."
2,"not a ""high flyer""",This book did not interest me at all. It takes first about 200 pages to come to the most important time for Boeing in the commercial airline industrie and even this is not well documented. Written by someone with obvious no feeling with the airline industrie and could have been well written in no more than 100 pages.
1,Awful,"Incredibly boring, uninteresting book. With no experience in the aviation or airline industry, the author relies on few interviews and going through the memoirs of some executives. He has no passion for his subject. It would be an OK book if the author had any writing talent. But he is a lousy writer and it shows on almost every page of this book...."
5,"Examples of living life to its fullest, presented in song.","This CD presents, in a mix of country and popular styles, a view of living life to its fullest. The title song describes what might have happened if one were to turn south, instead of north, on the way to a corporate assignment. Once you get your toes in the sand, nothing else seems to matter.'Livin' Till The Day I Die' describes how many young men grew up during the 60's and reminds us all to take that occasional chance. You might just end up a winner but if you lose it will still be a benefit because you tried anyway.'The Things You Do When You're Drinking' describes a few faux pas which may have been experienced by anyone who has overindulged in an attempt to have a good time.""Laid Back And Key Wasted"" contains a good mix of song ideas presented to please almost everyone. An excellent first presentation of all original music."
1,Frustrating,"Peggy Lee was a great artist; we find here many rare performances which are cut short, with the narrators talking over them. About every solo is ""filled"" with a voice-over that says ""she was the best""..."
3,good not great,this CD is OK but not great -- original artists and 15 good 60's songs (but not all my favorites)
1,Was this photocopied?!,"I am in a class in college where this book was a necessity. I searched by book code, and the edition that came up in paperback looked right. I saw that the Kindle edition was much cheaper, and went for it. I was terribly disappointed to find that this Kindle edition is the WRONG or MISMATCHED edition, and that the paperback is completely different. I ended up having to buy the hard copy instead. Terrible quality, and it doesn't even allow you to jump to pages you want to read, doesn't register the text as text, and appears very faded as opposed to the crispness of all my other Kindle books. Do not get this."
5,Under the Radar,"""Let Go"" is the highlight of this recording for me, featuring top names in the music industry, namely Dave Alvin and Don Heffington, and is well worth the price. Amy is a well-established musician, having known of her work for over 16 years from her time in Austin to the present. She deserves to be heard. Have a listen."
4,A little smaller than I thought,"This ball is a little smaller than I thought, but really a good size for my 2 1/2 yr old daughter. She kicks it around and it's been in our backyard for about 5 months and it still looks and works great. Overall, good buy."
4,Nice,"As seen. Not a ""full size"" ball but good for a 4-yr old. Hoping that it holds up, but it seems fine."
4,Nicely done,"I enjoyed this television show, mainly because all of the characters were different. I appreciate how Townsend touched on a diverse amount of issues, such as the transition from being rich to experiencing poverty, racism, single parenting, alcoholism, GED, breast cancer, domestic violence, infidelity, widowhood ETC ETC. Although, I thought that the television show had gaps in the story, I would recommend viewing it on instant for $2.99 versus buying the dvd. Another option would be to visit the website and view MOST of the shows for FREE!SITE: [...]"
3,It was okay,This was another slow movie but kind of true in some people cases. It was okay to watch if you had nothing else to do and couldn't find anything on TV.
1,LOW BUDGET,"All I can say is, SAVE YOUR MONEY AND TIME! Horrible low budget movie with a weak story line! I can't believe Monica Calhoun did a movie with such a terrible story line!"
2,diary of a single mom,"I felt very disappointed during this movie. I thought it would get better as it went along, but it did not. It would have been a great play that's why I purchased it because I thought it was a play. However, after I seen That Robert Townsend was the writer and noticed some of the actors and actress that played in the film, I decided to give it a shot and not return it. I just expected more from the film than what was actually there. If you really want this movie I will sell it for five dollars."
2,Not Very Durable,"This tool set just arrived yesterday and my 2 yr. old only played with it for about 5 minutes before the hammer broke. He was just hitting the nail into the side of the toolbox into the slot and the hammer split into two pieces. Obviously this toy is not very durable and I definitely would not recommend it. Now I may look for a plastic tool set, maybe it will last longer."
2,Caution -- splinter hazard!,"I was excited when we received this toy as a gift -- I think M&D products in general are pretty neat. But about 10 minutes after my son started playing with it, he burst into tears as he had gotten a huge splinter in his finger. I took a closer look, and it is quite obvious that when the holes were drilled in the tool box, they were drilled too fast -- the inside of each hole was broken out like it had been punched through, and there were up to 1/8 inch slivers of wood that could easily break off of the product. The wooden bolts also have some drill issues -- the paint is chipped around the holes (it was clearly drilled after painting). Even the inside of the wooden flat pieces to hammer or screw through are somewhat rough. All in all, disappointing craftmanship on what seemed like a nice product at first."
1,Chemical smell...WASTE of money!,"So reading peoples reviews about the ""chemical paint smell"" I thought some may be exaggerating about the strong odor....BUT NO they are not! I just wasted my money because I will not let my 1.5 year old boy play with this. The smell is so strong it kinda made me sick after sniffing a a few of the tools. My 5 year old son even said ""Mommy, that hammer smells funny!.""I washed the hammer and the tool box and only gave those items to my son...but I think I will actually call it a loss and throw them out.DO NOT waste your money...find a ""green"" product. I have found ""Green Toys"" here on Amazon and will try and only buy their product, though items are limited...but great selection of fake food."
4,Overall it is good.,"Overall it is good. My son is only 14mos so all he is doing is banging around the pieces but I can see him growing with it. Only one of the pegs fits snugly like it is suppose to so he can hammer them in but the others are loose and a disappointment. After the Chinese Lead Paint scare, I worry about any product like this."
4,Great introduction to tools & hardware,"My two-year-old daughter loves this tool kit! She loves helping my husband and me when we fix things around the house, so we thought we'd give her her own set. My only complaint is that the bolts are a little too long and can be frustrating for a little one (or not-so-little-one) to thread the nuts on. I'm sure she'll grow into it nicely."
3,Two refunds for this tool kit,"The first time I ordered this tool kit it was with Hastings and they had sent me some Breaking Dawn stickers instead of the tool kit I was very mad but they sent me a refund. This time I ordered it with Amazon and after a long wait to get this tool box it was cracked on the side. Of course I asked to send back the tool box but Amazon sent me a refund since I am such a faithful customer, since they let me keep it I fixed the tool box with gorilla glue and it was as good as new my boy loves to play with it he goes crazy. So I would recommended it, it was just an inconvenience to have to fix it but I got it for free so I can't complain!"
4,Cute toolbox but not toddlers,My daughter got this for Christams and she loves it! She is almost 5 years old and she still needs help getting some of the screws out but it keeps her occupied for at least 30 minutes when she plays with it. For the price you can't go wrong but this is not for smaller children. It would be hard to use and there are some sharp tools. We have taken it in the car so she has someone there to look over her while using it.
5,Great learning toy,"I bought this toy for my ten month old knowing he wouldn't be able to use it. I wanted him to have something to chew on while I quietly used my own tools fixing this and that. I checked that there wasn't any dangerous tiny bits to swallow and gave it to him. He chew a bit, spent a lot of time watching me and my husband showing him how it works...And now our one year old is almost able to use a screw driver and definitely knows how to use a hammer. I wasn't expecting that much from this toy, not so soon, and I'm really pleased!To me a great toy is one that will be enjoyed for years. This one is a good example.This said, my son is never left alone when playing, especially with that kind of toys. I believe that supervision is the best security."
3,Nice but a bit too simple,"This was a gift for our 2.5 year old. It's nice. I like that it's made of wood. It's a good start for teaching how tools work and what they do. It's somewhat versatile in the combination of hammer, wrench, screwdriver, nuts, bolts, and a couple of pegs (nails). However, you can't really build anything with it. Basically, you're just attaching one thing to the other in line, instead of having some angled pieces so you can make something interesting or recognizable. In that aspect it's disappointing and while our daughter was excited about the toy at first, she quickly lost interest, and rarely goes back to it. The age recommendation is 3-6 years. That's a joke."
2,Not the best tool box at all...,"This tool box has way too many 'pieces' and not enough tools. And the tools are not very realistic either (more of a mallet than a hammer). The wood has splintered and the paint is chipping off too. The screws are untouchable, and we have had to throw a lot of them away because the splinters are so bad after having been threaded a few times in the holes. Not at all impressed with this tool kit. The Green Toys tool box is leaps and bounds better than this one. Not only is it made from recycled material with no chemicals, but the tools look and work like real tools. We have had both tool boxes for over a year, and my son uses the Green Toys one nearly every day, but barely touches this Melissa & Doug one."
3,'Nails' impossible to remove,My son got this toy for his second birthday. He has really enjoyed playing with it along side his grandfather who is doing some remodeling. There have been two problems that we have encountered. The first is that once the 2 'nails' have been hammered in to the holes on the tool box they are impossible to remove without resorting to adult tools and strength. The prying end of the hammer does not fit around the nail and they fit too snugly for even by very strong husband to pull them out by hand. The other problem is that the box is too small for kids to easily use as a platform to build off of.
3,a little advanced for my 2 year old,thought she would love this as she loves to help Daddy do anything with tools and she loves the cobblers bench she has already. But she has trouble working the screws and the tools. I think she is just not ready for it yet. Anticipate she will grow into it. BTW she loves the hammer she bangs on the tool box and the other tools so far they have stood up to this abuse well.
1,Made in China.,"Once again, I ordered this product because it was listed as made in USA. It's not. The label on the bottom of the box says ""Made In China"". Am very disappointed in Amazon's listing of this product."
1,"MADE IN CHINA, NOT USA","I was determined to only buy ""Made in USA"" products from now on. I did a ""made in usa"" search on Amazon and was pleased to find this for my 3 year old grandson. As soon as I got it I searched the label for that ""Made in USA"" print. All I found was ""Made in China"". I am very disappointed and am sending it back for a refund. Don't trust the ""search"" option. The other items I purchased from ""Green Toys"" out of California are WONDERFUL. SUPPORT THEM !!!"
2,Nice but parts not compatible with workbench,"We got this because we thought it would give us more parts for the M&D workbench, however they are different sizes. It's fine on its own but one would think they would be interchangeable from the same company."
3,it is alright,the screws have already come apart and my son has only had them since Christmas. It isn't to big of a deal because we have wood glue. But I feel like the price you pay for Melissa & Doug toys should mean that you don't have to repair them yourself.
4,"Cute toolbox, but it could use some changes","I bought this for my 2 year old Bob the Builder fan. It is difficult to use the toolbox to hammer into, but if you turn it on it's side your builder can hammer all day long. It's a little tight at first, but after you hammer a couple of nails and pull them out it gets easier. I like this toolbox because its a little more difficult for little hands. My son has to really think about hitting the nails and turning the wrench and screwdriver, but he can do it. This set looks real and my son loves that. If he sees his daddy using tools he will go get his tools so he can help. Some kids might get frustrated with it, but I think that it's teaching fine motor skills.We love it"
2,very limited,"My son LOVES most construction toys and barely touches this one. While there are ""nails"" and ""washers and screws"", they are awkward to use on the toolkit - mainly for lack of space. Very cute, though, just not terribly practical."
1,DON'T BUY - incompatible with other wooden sets from the same manufacturer,"Don't bother to buy this, if you think of providing your kid(s) with an extended wooden construction kit by adding pieces from various ""Melissa & Doug"" wooden construction sets together, as the various sets are INCOMPATIBLE (screw threads and lengths, plate thickness, etc). A true disappointment. The whole series is poorly conceived, with no thought given to compatibility between - and therefore expansion of - sets. Worse yet, quality is poor: threads on screws tend to chip or erode very easily during use, leaving saw dust all over the play area. The number of pieces is too limited to allow for more than the construction of two or three toys, and one must disassemble an existing construction before building a new one."
2,Dangerous and Difficult Toy,"Although it is a neat concept, we don't let our son(s) play with this anymore (and haven't since a week after we purchased it). The screwdriver is a hard, sharp wooden tool that could really be dangerous if he slips or falls on it. Also, we hammered in one of the ""nails"" and even my husband couldn't get it back out again. There are lots of other ""tool kits"" out on the market and for safety's sake, I would suggest choosing something else."
1,Very Disappointed,"I bought this for my 2 grandsons, ages 3 & 6. They love to watch their Grandpa using tools and I thought this would be perfect for them. There are only two pegs to hammer. Some holes are too tight for the pegs to fit into and other holes are too big and the peg slips right through! There is absolutely no use for the screwdriver at all. You must use your hands to screw the bolt onto the head of the screwdriver. This toy is more for sorting colors & shapes. I was very disappointed at this Melissa & Doug product. It's purpose is not to use tools at all, so I don't know why it's called a tool box! My grandsons spent about 5 minutes with it and then walked away. I didn't blame them!!"
3,Just Ok!,"My 15 month old son loves to hammer on this toy. I wish that it would have come with more nails instead of screws because the screws don't really do much (they're mostly just scattered around the house for me to step on). Otherwise, the product seems very durable and is a great toy to take along to Grandma & Grandpa's house!"
5,Great Toy!!!,This was a great toy for my tool loving nephew! He loves it and plays with it all the time while daddy works too!
5,Worth so much more than the price!,"I got this for my 18 month old son. The minute I opened it him and his 3 year old sister were fighting over it. I was surprised at how many things are in this. Melissa and Doug products are normally so expensive, I wasn't expecting too much. This came with a wrench, hammer, screwdriver, screws, nuts and bolts. The pieces are large enough that they can't be swallowed by a little one.My 18 month old can only hammer in the nails and screw in the bolts. He can't quite use the screwdriver, however he loves holding on to it and pretend he's fixing things around the house. The hammer is his favorite.My 36 month old girls has mastered all the tools and loves to sit and play with this set for 30 minutes or more at a time.I love the fact that everything conveniently fits inside the toolbox, so it's easy to clean up and the kids can take it along wherever they go.The box also comes with educational extension activities, which include learning colors. Love it!"
4,Very good purchase!,"My 2-year old son just loves it! Very durable, nice and educational. It's also very light-weight and resembles true tool-box a lot!"
3,Small wooden tool set.. durable but not helpful!,"After reading tons of reviews, I chose this item as it is durable, wood, well constructed. Of course, like many other buyers, I did not realize how small it would be! it is so little! may be for the little hands it is okay. but it seemed so tiny for me, when I saw the box! My son is just loading his tools and carrying the box around the house. He just did not play well (as it is too early to say now in one day!), But he said he loves that. he was the one who was asking for a tools box. a bench kind of box could have been better for working, but they are all more expensive or cheap plastic. it looks cute and rich! one discomfort with this toy is, ones he hammered, it would be hard for him to take it out by himself. and finally he does not show any interest in it, as the activity he can do is too few.."
3,My expectation was little more...,There is very little kids can do with the pieces provided. I bought this for my 3.5 yr old son.
2,Spend Your Money Elsewhere,"I purchased this to go with a wooden tool bench made by Guideco that my son really enjoys playing with, but the pieces dont fit in the toolbench. And the tool box doesn't stand on its own as a toy. He would never play with the tool box and its contents without the toolbench. If you are in the market for a tool bench, consider the one from Educo. Its a little more expensive, but looks more engaging than the one from Guideco."
1,Badly designed and executed,"I like all the other Melissa and Doug toys we've gotten. This one isn't good. Don't buy it. The screws are too long, and screwing them down is boring. The screwdriver doesn't fit into the screw slots well and just causes frustration. The ""nails"" (pegs, really) slide easily into and out of any hole, making the hammer superfluous and the pegs useless.I'm not sure whether to take out the pegs and hammer and just throw those away -- they only serve to confuse.M&D; products are generally better than this. Perhaps they'll fix the design. Until that happens, don't buy it."
3,"Cute, but difficult","This is a cute set, but difficult for my toddler to use. The heads on the screws also don't stay together very well."
5,Aspiring carpenter really loves this tool kit,"My son is three and he's a devoted tinkerer. The Melissa and Doug tool kit thrills his soul. He ""repairs"" stuff all around the kitchen while I cook. The pieces are great quality, the right size for his level of manual dexterity, and you get a lot of variety in the kit (nuts and bolts, stuff to hammer, stuff to screw, etc.). I like the tool box because I love any toy that comes with it's own container. Makes pick-up time simple. In a world overrun with plastic and battery-operated toys, it makes me feel happy to see my kiddo preferring wood ones."
4,Overall happy,"Overall I think my kids will get pretty good use out of this toy (3 yo twin boys) and it seems to be of good quality. I am however very disappointed that the screws are not compatible with the Melissa and Doug workbench. My parents bought the work bench for the boys and bought each a tool kit thinking they could build more and bigger toys with the expanded set. They can use them with the connectors from the work bench, but the screws, nuts and connector blocks have a different threading size than those in the tool kit."
2,poor quality,"We were quite disappointed with this toy. One of the end pieces fell off right after just opening up the package. The pegs are too easy to hammer in and our granddaughter likes more of a challenge than what this toy has to offer. It's too easy, and the quality is disappointing. Once again, ""Ya get what ya pay for!"""
4,A good historical adventure,"Cole's prose is sometimes awkward, sometime vague. The Sea Kings was self-published which is a shame because it would have benefitted from a good editor.Nonetheless, this is a good story with distinct, three dimensional characters and lots of historical detail. Our Minoan hero travels from Mycenean Greece to ancient Babylon and Egypt with encounters with traders, slavers, soldiers, and beautiful women along the way. Cole gives us a great taste of the ancient world as we follow along a likeable, believable lead character. Recommended to fans of historical fiction."
4,"A good tale, grand scope, well told.","The story is set in Crete 1734-29 BCE but because the young male protagonist Tanuati has chosen to embark on a trading career we see Babylon, Egypt and Malta as well. I was delighted to find a novel set in the fascinating period of the Bronze Age Mediterranean. Not much of this kind of material is available to the non-academic reader. The Minoans had a beguiling culture and I admire Les Cole for doing the research required to make this a convincing read. Make no mistake, this is no history text book. The hero is idealistic, intelligent, romantic and impetuous and there's plenty of action."
5,Fabulous puzzle!,"I bought this toy for my little one just shortly after her first birthday. She loved it. She has always been fascinated with opening and closing doors, so this kept her entertained for long periods of time. It didn't take her long to learn how to take the pieces out and remember where each one goes. Now, almost a year later, she still plays with this puzzle."
3,One Broke in less than 3 weeks,"I have been using these covers for three weeks now, and they work well preventing my toddler from turning the knobs on the stove. We also determined in order to use less finger strength, rotate the cover so the opening latch is not in line with the top of the stove knob. (My 66 year old mom has no problem opening them.) The only problem we've had so far is one of the latches broke on a cover. I haven't contacted the company, yet to determine how well they stand by their product. Otherwise the product works as advertised."
2,Not so hot,"I confess that I got the knobs for my dog, who turned the gas on once. But the problem is that I cannot open the things either. It takes a fair amount of hand strength to open the knobs. I will have to find another solution. The idea is fine, just not the actual use."
3,its a decent product,It keeps my toddler from turning the stove knobs which is what it is meant to do however it is very hard to open for adults and a hassle to use.
4,"Strange days, indeed","This album spotlights some of the most peculiar music ever recorded. The tracks were all taken from one person's record collection. They were copied right from the old records, so they have some scratches and pops on them. Despite the audio flaws, this is a fun CD. You get moog instrumentals, novelty songs, word jazz, Hawaiian music, xylophone instrumentals, children's gospel music and some things that are uncategorizable. Recommended for fans of cool and strange music."
1,this cd sucks,"you know i thought this would be a great cd but no it is a total piece of dreck exceptfor ken nordine he is a god in spoken word, i wished i would have bought two coppiesone to poop on and one to cover it up."
3,it's okay,The dividing bars didn't fit when I inserted them into rack. Disappointed since this isn't a cheap item. I just ended up taking them out. Otherwise it works great in my pantry to stockpile cans when they go on sale.
5,Deluxe can storage rack,Deluxe Chrome Canned Food Storage Rack This is a great product. No more can food turning over or around. Keeps everythingorganized. My cabinet shelves always look great.
5,Perfect for organizing can storage,"Easy to assemble, sturdy, and exactly the thing to help organize, store, and know what I have in my cupboards."
3,"I wanted to ""love"" it...","It was a pain for me to put together although I will admit building things...even simple things...frustrates me. It's strong, but not as strong as I'd hoped. I have the large ready-to-eat soups on there and the metal began to bend."
5,great storage,"strong and easy to work with. came in a timely manner. saved me tons of space in my pantry, would buy again"
3,Good idea but design needs improving.,"This works well for its intended purpose but it was impossible for all of the components to fit together. I was able to get the shelves on finally (the top one took two people and fifteen minutes - seriously), but I was only able to attach on of the dividers that separate the ""aisles"" of cans. You shouldn't have to physically damage the product for it to assemble properly. It is still usable and saves a ton of space in my small kitchen, but I was disappointed in the quality."
2,"Made in China quality, with worse instructions.","Quality of construction so poor, this must be made in China. Only thing worse was the instructions, which consisted of only the following warning, "" if put together wrong, parts will not fit."" No other instructions."
3,Okay product...just not for wire shelves,"This product receives three stars because it does not sit level and steady on wire shelves. Ideally it should be set up on a solid surface. I used zip ties to secure mine to our wire pantry shelves, but this is not ideal. I am fairly certain that the cans stacked and organized in rows takes up the same amount of cubic space. Wire brackets used to separate cans often slip and don't stay in place. Unit can be frustrating."
5,"Once you have it assembled, it's perfect!","I do wholeheartedly agree with other reviewers - assembling this thing IS a real pain, and the instructions are lacking. It took me some guesswork to figure it out. But once I did, the thing is sturdy and has made such a difference in my pantry.I like that you can modify the width of each ""divided"" area. I can store everything from big 28oz cans, jars of spaghetti sauce, to small tomato paste style cans. I bet this would be great for baby food, too. I used to literally lose cans in my pantry... stacked up and in the back... now I can see what I have right away, and what I'm out of.Initially I did think this item was overpriced. But it's standing the test of time (8 months now) and I'm super happy I got it. It's worth the money."
2,parts don't fit together,"It is strongly built and works well BUT,1. Each shelf had a hook on each of the 4 corners to attach to side frames. However, the back piece was too wide and one of hooks on each shelf would not attach. I fixed this by using 1 1/2 inch 'S' hooks.2. There are six divider rods, two for each shelf, to divide the rows of cans. They were too short and would not fit. This is not a problem because the dividers are not really necessary. It works fine without them.3. It is fairly easy to assemble but it would have been nice if a one page exploded view were included for those not so mechanically inclined."
5,organize your pantry in a small space.,I have very little cubboard space. I could never find anything without climbing on a step stool and hunting and hunting. Now I can take a glance and find things quickly. Makes things look organized and it is very easy to put together.
2,Not as great as I first thought,"I've had this product for about three weeks. It seemed sturdy enough when I first got it, and it came together in about a minute flat, but I've yet to fill it up entirely, and it's already starting to bend in the center of the top two racks. I'm not super excited about that development but we'll see how it holds up. Initially I was going to order a second one but now I think I'll do some more shopping around. I'd have preferred to have everything match in the pantry but not if it's at the cost of breakage and scattered cans at some point."
4,sturdy & utilitarian,"I am very pleased with the Organize It All Can Rack. It is very sturdy and even holds jars of spaghetti sauce securely. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I would like for the rods on the shelves to be closer together to accommodate smaller cans. I purchased 3 for my pantry and they solved the problem of trying to stack cans only to have them fall over when looking for something. Everything is visible and accessible. Great product, shipping was right on time, and arrived in perfect condition."
1,Didn't work out,"Lucky to all the other reviewers who received a good product. I hoped mine would work out. The material on the rack is sound. However, the design is flawed. Upon assembly, the can dividers stayed in place on the top rack but was LOOSE on the middle and lower rack; it would not stay in place to be considered a divider for cans, which are heavy. I had trouble getting a full refund with the seller (OrganizeIt) because of this defect, but that's a review for the seller, which I'll certainly leave feedback on."
3,Satisfied,Its hard to reach in back to put new cans. Dividers move real easy would like them to stay in place better. Otherwise it works just like it should.
4,3 tier can rack,"I recently purchased 3 of these. They were easy to assemble. The only problem I had was if you double stack the top level, It sags a little, so I don't recomend double stacking. Other than that, I am very pleased with tham."
1,Incorrect information in listing,"The dimensions stated in the listing are NOT the correct product dimensions. We ordered three of these and cannot use any of them because they are not the size we thought they were. Sending them back. The ones I got were 17.75"" wide, 12.75"" tall, and 14.75"" deep. Too bad, because they seem like a decent product that we could use if they were the right size."
5,It didn't fit,I have not much space in my kitchen so it didn't fit. I have to send it back. It took a while but they attend me great.
4,Pantry is much better!,"Helps me fit a lot more into my not very big pantry. Makes it easier to find things. Bigger than I expected, so make sure you read the dimensions before ordering. Luckily, it still fit for me, but my top rack can't fit much. Would have probably ordered something a little smaller had I realized that, but I still really like this!"
3,can good storage rack,"I ordered this can good organizer which came in time and packaged nicely. Not too difficult to put together and it is sturdy and nice looking. Big problem though, I can not use it anyware because it is too too deep that it won't fit anywhere. It does not rotate cans and therefore I really don't know what I have in the rack."
2,Baffled by directions!!!,"I don't normally write reviews, but I've rarely been so frustrated with a purchase from Amazon, so I had to do this. Seems like a quality, sturdy piece that would organize my pantry but I can't get the darn thing together! No matter how I ""flip"" the thing or whatnot, I cannot get the thing to even sit flat, let alone line up. And what is up with having customer service hours open for only 4 hours with a long distance call!?!? The reason I gave it two stars is because it does appear to be of good quality, but the quality is quickly lost on the directions!!!!"
4,Works fine,It works well but I put it in my lower cabinets and it is not too easy finding the right can because I have to crouch down and look in a dark cabinet. It would be perfect if it was counter height but who wants a big soup can disposer on the counter.
5,"Great for pantry organization, if your pantry is big enough","This is 16"" deep, 17"" wide, and 13"" tall. I got it put together easily enough, it's very sturdy. I got over to my pantry and my pantry door is only 18"" wide. It just fit! Love it, as I was tired of stacking and layering my cans."
2,poor customer service,"When I received my unit, a few pieces were missing,I called the company and was told they would get thepieces out to me right away. 2 1/2 months later, stillno parts."
2,too much to take apart,"Same as the quality section above. I would not recommend this product to anyone. I considered returning it to them, but since I had it assembled, it was too much to take apart and put in the box as received."
2,putting it together is a major pain,The rack looks good and appears to be durable. But putting it together is a major pain because the shelves for the rack do not fit. You have to bend the edges of the shelf hooks so that they fit into the structure. The wiring is quite hard to bend and it becomes an issue.
3,Can't see cans in back.,"Sorry. In the end, it's easier to see labels and grab cans stacked vertically in a cabinet than it is to use this rack.I would not buy another."
5,Excellent pellets!,I get incredible accuracy from these out of my Webley & Scott Vulcan springer. They're consistant enough in shape and weight that I can't notice any difference in them when I shoot out to 35-40 yards. I use the gun mostly for rabbit and squirrel hnting and I haven't been disappointed once with them. I'll buy these til the gun falls apart!
4,Comprehensive and Detailed,"This is, in my opinion, the best biography of Voltaire. It is comprehensive, detailed, and so full of detail that one can get a true sense of the man and his times. Beserman establishes himself as a true authority on Voltaire, and this work his chock-full of almost every possible detail.For a cursory overview of Voltaire, there are other books, but if you want a true picture of the man, the myth, the legend, this is it. Highly recommended for the scholar or the layman interested in the heroic French philosopher.It has also led me to the original works, such as La Henriade, Zadig, etc."
3,Review by Yobe the Mage,"I expected more changes in the game's most recent upgrade, but was disapointed in the few changes they made. Consequently, World of Warcraft is kicking Asheron's Call's butt. Too bad because at one time Asheron's Call was the best multiplayer game on the internet. Now World of Warcraft is dominating by a huge amount. Thanks for the chance to comment.Jim French"
5,Asheron's Call? the bomb.,"I Have been Playing Asheron's Call since 1999 (on and off) and i am currently playing, this game is very well put together and is very well liked, especially to the people who dont concentrate on a plot or story line, once you finish the tutorial, your free!, the game is great and the new expansion material is very creative and fun. The enviroment is also very nice, there are many many people who will help you (the people who are mean can be reported at a last resort, but mainly ignored), including me =). just for a warning, the different servers may vary. also if you dont want to die alot and get frustrated DONT PLAY DARKTIDE IFSO, it is a PvP, or Player Versus Player Server, meaning once your out there your a free kill to anyone. if anyone new kids, need help im Grasp Of Demon, or Death's Sage, on the MorningThaw server (Note: in my opinion, its the best, please join!)Thanks,Gamer Name, Grasp"
1,Fine if you are over level 180,"First on the new graphics... I have not seen them yet as they have not been released.For all new items you must be over at least level 130 to get to the new island, except a few dungeons camped by people macroing.All patchs that have come out since release are aimed toward extream high levels. Or melee. Case in point GW quest last month. No low level could kill a pumpkin lord. The buffer was camped by a level 210 to get the goodies. This month content is all mage resistant if you are under level 150. The one new orb intrduced into the game is buged. The so called event you had to be over level 100 to attend.I have been waiting since release for a answer from their tech support on migrating problems with 2 of my accounts. They offer no support unless you want to make a long distance call.So unless you are a high level melee or very high level mage do not waste your time and money on this. It is not like the old days where they added something for everyone."
4,"Great Game, Wonderful community","I've been playing AC for going on 5 years now. I have many friends in the game, and am a member of a very active clan.Seems like nobody plays AC without having passionate feelings about it. Even the nay-sayers act like they've had their favorite toy trifled with, and are bitterly disappointed.The game is very well balanced with tons of content for all levels. It has exciting, heart pounding quests, and hunting for solo or group play. And there are a lot of people that play the game for the purely social aspect. Camaraderie abounds in my and other clans."
4,Set aside an afternoon and read this book!!!!,"The most horrific thing a child could experience has happened. There, right before his eyes, the most important person in his life is humiliated, beaten, and then killed. Adding insult to injury, the killers are set free and rewarded with a court settlement of his inheritance! If you ever wondered what serial killers are made of, you've found the perfect recipe. Billy never stood a chance with his alcoholic mother and abusive stepfather. Travel with Billy as he follows his misguided conscience and attempts to avenge all the wrongs in the world. You'll feel his pain and that of his victims!!!"
1,Please Don't buy this CD,"All I could hear was a woman trying (not Sucessfully) to sing. Her voice is strained, manufactured, and without any emotion whatsoever. No heart, no soul"
3,Helpful intro but a poor reference,"This book really did get me off on the right foot. It provides a helpful perspective that was invaluable to a Subversion beginner. The tone is just right.However, as I started running into problems, the book fell flat on its face. I couldn't find anything related to my tasks in the index, and there seems to be no coverage of simple concepts like removing directories or groups of files, nor are there any tips and tricks or scripts that might help to maintain my repository. And though there's coverage of a popular Windows GUI client, there's just no help for Mac developers.I have to give this book three stars. At this price, my hopes were a lot higher."
3,"Nice book, covers in some way a wide range of questions about Version Control and Subversion","This book is very nice on its propouse. Covers a lot of questions about Version Control and Subversion. Actually nice and objective explanations on the uses and the greater resources that this tool offer us.The thing that really is missing here, for me, would be examples of ""pragmatic"" setup of diversified envirioments, I mean, a good evirioment for Web App developing is completely forgotten here. And so for other applications too, such as the development of this self Book. They mentioned as greate note that they used Version Control on this book, actually moved to Subversion, but no topics on Subversioning a Book development.So, I just think they could expend another hundred pages and go deepier on pratical examples of more sorted applications that Version Controling with Subversion can have."
3,Pragmatic Version Control is a 'must have' reference book,"I had been using subversion for a few years before I got this book. I was not good at it, I wouldn't even say that I was proficient! This book met me right where I was and helped me to gain confidence and proficiency.It was a little bit of a pain to have to follow through the examples from the beginning of the book. Nonetheless, I find it to be very useful."
3,Too wordy by far,"This book is targeted at someone who is likely already familiar with version control systems (as it frequently refers back to differences with CVS), yet tries to be for the beginner as well. As an experienced user (as I am) you will have to wade through a lot of verbiage to get to what you want. The author uses a conversational style. I got all I could from this book in two frustrating hours, when what I really wanted was a more terse reference."
4,A great title for the controllers,"I liked much the discussions within, but the subjects wider than presented here. But still this is worth the price.Also nice and small to read, which is helpful."
4,Words of Ghandi,"I enjoyed reading so many of the sayings and quotes that Ghandi had shared with us. I wish there had been more history on Ghandi, but the inspirational words were wonderful."
1,THIS CANDY IS NOT GLUTEN FREE,The listing for this candy says it is gluten free. It is NOT. It contains wheat flour. This candy has made me sick. I trusted the Amazon listing instead of the fine print in German. If you need to eat gluten free do not buy this
5,Best Haribo gummies,By far the best Haribo Gummies. Variety is great and it's always a surprise what you get.
2,you get what you pay for,"bought two. one came with a cracked lense crystal - easy return though. the one I use is giving me trouble with the volume on the mike and sometimes I don't get video. Since is doesn't come with a helpful how to use book or any website support I have been on my own. When it works, my picture and sound go through."
5,Great seller,"Great seller prompt delivery and excellent condition and still working great, first one was DOA but replaced quick and works as advertised even better"
5,Awesome workhorse,Had my last one for 12 years. Just got a new one. Worth the money to have a hairdryer designed to heat hair but will not burn it like a cheap hairdryer can because the mechanism is typically too hot and too close to the hair. This is a high quality product that arguably saves money since you will keep it for a long time and not buy several cheap hair dryers in the meantime.
3,Not Quite Professional Strength,"I have thick, curly hair and need the heat that I have so far only found to be available in a professional model to straighten my hair. This one does not seem to get as hot as the professional ones I've used so I can't get my hair to straighten like I would like. However, it is lightweight with a long cord, so it will be great for travel."
1,What Idiot designed this thing?,"This is a frustrating product I recieved one and the lights stopped working the same day. So I ended up getting another one and it arrived not working. The case is hard and sturdy, don't plan on getting your iPod out unless you have long nails or a screwdriver. I think the company is messing with us."
4,fun music,"Love the case. Wish it had an off button. And the extra compartment on the bottom for the batteries adds bulk, however I am not sure where else the batteries would go."
5,Foodsaver bags are great!,"Have been using these for awhile now...whether they go in the freezer or in my pantry, the bags keep my stuff as fresh as the day i ""savered"" them."
4,Very good and to expensive,"I think the foodsaver bags work great, but cost to much. Don't put cheap things in the bags or your savings will be gone."
5,Best deal on the Web!,"As always Amazon delivers great deals for their customers. Shipping was lightning fast too. These bags are of excellent quality and they keep your food fresh and freezer burn free. Since I discovered the food Saver machine and bags, I have saved lots of $$ because I no longer have to re-buy food that has gone bad by storing it ineffectively.Thank you Amazon for making this available to your customers =)"
2,Sometimes they seal; sometimes they don't seal,"I bought these rolls the same time I bought the Rival vacuum sealer. The vacuum sealer came with a few bags which sealed perfectly. However, the Foodsaver rolls (3 pack) sealed unevenly. In other words, some seal and others don't. I have tried every variation possible to get the bags cut from the rolls to seal, and if the bag won't seal, it just won't seal. As a result, I won't buy rolls again. I'll buy bags which I know do seal."
5,Foodsaver bag rolls at a great price,"Fast shipping and a great price for these Foodsaver narrow bag rolls, which are hard to find."
5,The only way to go,Don't go with knock offs. I have yet to find one that seals and performs as well as the original. At least for now they are worth the money.
5,Tough bags,"I love putting food in these bags. Especially prepared foods. You put them in the freezer and when you want to make them for dinner, you boil some water and put in the frozen bags. You have a perfect dinner in a very short time. They also really do prevent freezer burn much better than Ziploc bags."
5,Love it,I love my foodsaver and this roll lets you create whatever size bags you want to use. Love it all!!!!
5,Most excellent,I have tried the off brands and the Sears brand bags. I will never stray from the FoodSaver brand of bags again. I have an older base model FoodSaver sealer that works well harvest season after harvest season.
3,Basic functions,"I purchased this phone as a ""back up"" in the event my main phone became inoperable (which it did) but I digress. This phone is great for the basics only. Texting, speakerphone and of course voice. The call quality is o.k. speakerphone functions fairly well, texting can be a hassle, having to search out the letters below the numeric value on the keys (I'm used to a qwerty key board) I agree with the previous review, you get what you pay for."
4,"Good story, but not a classic","I read this story with my 11 year old daughter and she really liked it, which I think is more important than whether or not I liked it. The idea of book characters having lives beyond the story in which they live is nicely done and I very much like that Princess Sylvie is strong and thinks outside the written confines of her part in the story. Others have noted that most of the characters are flat and not well developed. In my view, that is one of the story's themes. They are underdeveloped, because they cannot think beyond the lines written for them. Princess Sylvie can, which makes her unique. Overall, a very good book and I very much recommend it."
3,I wish someone else had written it,"This is a story within a story. Princess Sylvie is trapped in a book, reliving the same story for 80 years or so, each time a Reader opens the book. When the book is set on fire and burns to a crisp, the princess and many of the other characters flee, crossing over into a Reader's mind, where they become part of her subconscious. Interesting concept, clunky and sometimes boring execution. Some cute moments. I think a different writer could have gone far with this idea."
5,A true tale of wonder,"I picked up this book on a hunch a few years ago - and how right that hunch was! Funny enough to hook a 6-year-old, touching enough to hook an adult, and adventure enough for both... this book has a place in my heart right next to Rob Reiner's wonderful film translation of ""The Princess Bride"". There is a rich subtext of dealing with aging, death and loss that gives the story a depth that most children's fantasies lack; but it's handled so deftly that you don't see it so much as feel it.I read it to my daughter when she was six; when it ended she immediately made me go back and read it all over again (the only book that has elicited that reaction, so far). She asked for it again the next year, and the next (she can read it for herself now).*Highly* recommended, particularly for reading aloud!"
5,"I finally ""get"" Buddhism","Well, not really. But at least I now know the famous story of his life, and have a very good overview of how the movement has split/changed over the centuries. Very good book."
5,Ahhh...so thats how it began!,"Very interesting...if at all interested buy it. Gives great insight. Love how the early monks would tell nonsense riddles that make sense if you ""get it"""
4,great quality,"The blocks are great. The quality is great and the graphics are nice and clean. My baby and I play with these together. I show him the pictures and recite what they are to him. He loves them. My only complaint is that the picture is deceiving. There are only 26 blocks, so there are two empty spaces in the tray. The picture looks like the whole tray is full."
1,VOL. 4 DVD John Wayne,"It would be nice to know a little about this movie , there is no info about it here. So therefore , how do you know which one it is , what the title is , or anything about it. Info on this and more that has no info listed would help in the sales of them."
2,DJ SPOOKY THAT OVERRATED KID,"This is OK. But a lot of his skill seems to be in playing two older ambient peices over each other, then adding a cliched hip hop beat fed through a distortion box.....and there's his SHAMELESS self-promotion...writing about his own music under his real name without mentioning that the musician he's proclaiming to be ""the future"" is really himself is unforgiveable.Listen to SCORN instead!"
4,Ambient Masterpiece,"For anyone who associates DJs with corny dance remixes and dull club beats, DJ Spooky will blow that image away. ""Songs of a Dead Dreamer"", a collection of primarily ambient and textural works, is a dark and atmospheric work that shows Spooky's astounding ability of combining a variety of sources, from classical to electronic, and combining them into a smooth and beautiful whole. Anyone who is interested in the dark side of the ambient movement, especially fans of early Tangerine Dream and Klaus Schulze, should get this album. There is a somewhat self-indulgent but still interesting essay also included in the liner notes. Though Spooky does proclaim himself a ""music futurist,"" the tag line is surprisingly true. For anyone willing to slow down and listen, this album is an ambient classic."
4,"dark, foreboding, and a damn good listen","Your driving downtown, the bars have closed for the night, and somehow you've managed to get yourself lost in the bleak concrete jungle. You pop in your favorite DJ Spooky cd and become convinced that you are being followed. Looking for a dark, after-hours, paranoid mood? This is your album. As a whole, the album is a coherent piece that should be heard in its entirety from beginning to end. That said, there are several stand-out tracks that have become personal faves: the smokey film-noir jazzish ""Nihilismus Dub""; ""Galactic Funk"" which has a nasty 1970s inspired funk groove; and ""Juba"", an African-inspired piece sandwiched in between some organ playing that sounds fit for a baseball game; and ""the terran invasion..."", which has a distinctly Eno-esque quality supported by a reggae bassline. Well-worth the price of admission. Check it out."
2,Full of preservatives!,"I need raspberry purée or a similar substitute for use in my salad dressing recipe, which actually uses very healthy ingredients. The Lyons dessert sauce has high fructose corn syrup as it's primary ingredient. This tastes like it has a lot of preservatives. Sometimes it's true that you get what you pay for....a bottle of junk. I am going to look for a healthier alternative."
4,'Throne Of Drones' - Various Artists (Asphodel Records) 4 1/2 stars,"First time I heard about this release,a friend of mine more or less HAD to remind me that I was a fan of at LEAST some drone,which is rhBand and Flying Saucer Attack.Until THEN,I assumed those two artists were tagged as 'noisy space rock'.Had no idea as to what 'drone' actually meant.Well,I do now.I was quite impressed with 'Throne Of Drones',where you get an introduction-like cut of such artists as Robert Rich,Steve Roach,Jeff Greinke,Rhythm And Noise,plus nine others.These tracks are able to transport your mind on a galactic trip to unknown hemispheres.A great place where ambient,new age and drone collide on extremely friendly terms.A should-have."
4,The Millonaire Real Estate Mindset,Very Informative it has helped me so very much.After reading this book I now have The Millonare Mindset.
4,...,"A motivational material. if it'll motivate you to get up and get more knowledge on the subject, kudos for the author."
2,Hula Hands,"This book visually is very appealing. Lots of beautiful photos put together in a lovely presentation. I was disappointed however, in the content that clearly focused on the Hollywood idea of Hawaiian hula and all the commercial aspects of the art. Not a serious study of hula, as I expected it to be."
2,Stale,I was so looking forward to this item as I grew up eating it when I lived in Germany. I was disappointed that the candy was stale.
5,Historian,This is the most accurate account of the Battle of Britain I have ever seen. There are also 3 other videos in the Heroic Missions series: The Forgotten Squadron; Northwest Passage; Behind Enemy Lines.
5,one of the better GBA videos,"I would have to say that this GBA video is probably the best that I have seen, I have three others. It plays crisper, plus the audio and video seem to sync up better and not fall out of line with eachother as the video plays. I would recommend this video to people who have a GBA/DS and love Sonic games, and videos, on the go."
5,Not Romantic,"They're all great songs to own but the CD is hardly romantic. The song ""Time in a Bottle"" was for Croce's son. The song ""Everything I Own"" was for Gate's late father. The song ""Vincent"" was a tribute to Vincent van Gogh. ""Baby Come Back"", ""All By Myself"", ""On and On"", ...romantic is not the first word that comes to mind. So... ignoring the title of the CD, you do end up with a nice collection of 70s songs. For that I give 5 stars."
3,Weakest entry in an otherwise brilliant series..............,"Compared to the other volumes in the ""Chart Toppers: Romantic Hits Of..."" series, this installment is rather weak. Sure, there's a few good love songs to be found on this CD, but only several light up an otherwise dull compilation. If the truth be known, I found most of these songs somewhat depressing - especially Jim Croce's, ""Time In A Bottle"" and Don McLean's, ""Vincent"". I can't imagine ever being able to 'get-in-the-mood' with those melancholy tracks! It's worthwhile buying this if you've collected the first two volumes and are planning to purchase the next one too. But I'm sure you could find a better romantic 70s CD if you looked.Jon."
4,Super Gift,I have another boss who loves 40s and 50s music. I bought this for him for Christmas and he loves it!
4,Easy to listen to,This is a great compilation of some of those oldies that will bring memories flooding back. The tracks have been very well chosen and there's lots of good listening on this CD. Recommend to anybody who loves the early rock music and its' origins. Can't wait to get my next selection in the same theme.
4,Better than most,"The problem with ordering these CD's of the 50's is that you always miss that particular song you loved so much. This CD has most of the good ones. We were quite happy with the selection and love listening to it. When it arrived, there was a problem with the CD, as it stuck on one song and would not play forward. Amazon corrected this immediately by sending a replacement CD. I was really impressed with their response."
5,1950's Classic Collection,"If you liked the Chart Toppers, Big Bands of the 1950's. You'll get hours of listning pleasure. A Must for your collection"
5,This is one of the best vintage collection of songs.,"I'm so happy I bought this as a gift for my father, not only because he loves these songs and grew up with these songs, but I personally, know of them from various movies.I must say that, even though I'm in my twenties, I find all, and I mean all, the songs of this album are unique, and exceptional. Who can resist the sweet sounds of Ritchie Valen's ""Donna"", Frankie Avalon's ""Venus"" or Doris Day's ""Que Sera Sera"" to name a few. You can sing along to each song! I could sit back in the twilight hours, with a glass of mellowed liquor and take a trip back to the fifties when I listen to this CD. Its as if I actually lived through that era.You won't be sorry you bought this album for a loved one or yourself...."
4,Good stuff!,"I bought this CD for one song only (Sleepwalk by Santos & Johnny). When I first heard it, I was surprised by the number of really great songs on this CD from that era that I already knew and really enjoyed. All songs are by the original artists which is a must. Great CD!"
5,Inadvertently ordered this cd but was presently surprised.,"I ordered this cd by mistake instead of one from the 60's but now I am glad I did. The songs sound the same as I remembered -- all the original singers. It was great to hear Pat Boone, The Drifters, Jimmie Rogers and the other artists again. This would be great addition to anyone's cd collection."
1,A Poor Excuse For A DVD,"Don't get me wrong. I LOVE the story. I've seen it in the cinema in the 80's and I still love it. But the issue why I gave low ratings is because of the DVD. This is the first time I've seen a DVD where the makers of it, puts watermark images of the company in various scene in the movie. Talk about advertising!Second, on the cover, it was written that the movie has undergone digital transfer. The only thing that I think, where the movie got it ""digital transfer"" is from a poor quality VHS tape to DVD. This is absurd! Even the soundtracks bear the quality of a bad tape recording.I've watch other Sonny Chiba's movies from the 80's in DVD format like Ninja Wars and GI Samurai aka Time Slip and both quality is what a DVD should be. This one is clearly an attempt to make a quick money at the fans of the man.The first 2 reviews, refers to other movies and not the one in question. To Amazon, please remove this item from your listing."
2,There may be a reason this is out of print,"I.A. Richmond, though a meticulous historian, seemed to me to be trying his best to drain every drop of life out of this account of Roman Britain and he fairly much succeeded. I am used to reading historical narratives or at the least, reading historical accounts, where at least events are put into chronological order. Instead, the author, reels out lines of fact with very little linear connections at all. However, I will say that unknowingly to myself, I did find I had a wealth of facts about Roman Britain floating around in my head, but with no connections to anything. Possibly the most frustrating thing of all, is that Richmond never gives a reason for Roman's leaving Britain, or even a definitive period of time, when the Empire's grasp receeded, simply talking about Roman influence up to the 5th A.D. and then giving no reason, no explanation nor any following life after Roman recession."
5,Knife of God,"This knife is a godsend for anyone who loves cutlery. as soon as i held it, i could feel how perfectly weighted and balanced it was, and how sturdy it was. It came sharp, and included a catalogue and sheath. The steel is tough and difficult to sharpen, and the sheath is leather and stamped nicely on the front. The handle of my knife is starting to smell like beef jerky because of the leather, but that's a good thing. I haven't really used it for much, as i am trying to keep it nice... but it's definately a prestigeous blade."
4,"Great for is intended use, just don't push it","I've had my KA-BAR for about 13 years now. The blade holds its edge well and is easy to resharpen. Generally it's very well constructed and tough. I've hammered in tent stakes many times with no problem.I used it for quite a bit of batoning small-diameter wood for kindling over last winter. I understand that it's a ""fighting knife,"" not survival knife, but I thought it could take it, and for a long time it did. However, eventually the narrow tang bent just slightly inside the handle (enough to set the blade at an angle), and the butt cap retaining pin fell out. I was able to straighten the tang with the blade secured in a vise. KA-BAR sent me a new pin, and the reassembled knife feels solid again, but I'll restrict it to lighter use from now on and save the more serious work for my full tang Ontario Rat 7."
5,Serving In Combat Now,"I ordered this knife so that I could send it to my nephew, a US Army Airborne Ranger serving in Afghanistan. He LOVES it!!!!"
5,Krypton,"Krypton is great band, that plays quality music. Krypton's songs are cool, and their CD is worth buying."
2,"Very loud, battery hog","I think most battery operated toys benefit from having volume control. This is an extremely loud toy when it beeps. Also, it's easy for a kid to leave either a car or remote control on and drain the batteries completely (my husband even did it once) because there's no automatic shut-off. After that happened a couple of times, we just shelved it for a while. (Each remote takes 2 AAA batteries and the cars each take 3 AAA batteries, so yeah, 10 AAA batteries!) Lastly, if you own a pet, the wheels are small and can get seriously tangled up if you haven't just swept your floors; you have to take the whole thing apart to clean them out. On the upside, the kids do love it, a definite attention grabber."
1,Complaint,"One of the cars didn't work at all, but shipping too expensive to reurn.Disappointing christmas gift."
2,Get what you pay for.,"Honestly, they work alright usually, but if you use them with aluminum lugs then they'll stick to them and it's a real pain to get them off. I dont think I'd buy these again given the opportunity."
3,questionable quality,The set is ok for the price but I don't think the smaller sizes will stand up under use. Buy the chrome vanadium set instead.
4,Great,"This is a great cd. I first heard of concentration camp when they appearred with master p in the how you do dat video.Well if you listen to this is you will relize that they are on the same type of vibe as master p in his heyday. And the cd sounds great i like track 4 with master p. I think its track 8, it has the same beat as how you do dat.I dont know who made the song first though.I think concentration camp did."
2,Half the Story,An important book for all the details that it fills in on Cuban baseball before the Castro Revolution. But there is little here about the mysterious role of baseball on the island after Castro's rise to power. This book is more of a personal memoir of Echevarria's own childhood baseball memories than a true history which explores the full Cuban baseball story.
2,The Pride of Havana: A History of Cuban Baseball,"Although the book offers a TON of information on the history of baseball in Cuba, there is definitely way too much reading and not enough pictures! I would have liked to see pictures along with the reading."
5,Life altering,"This documentary truly gives you hope to keep moving forward when you think you can't continue. Grief and loss is so unique and to see true survivors make the journey and come through to the other side of the most tragic event is inspiring and should give hope to anyone viewing this piece. Despite such loss, life continues and can still bring joy despite such pain."
5,Rebirth DVD,"This documentary was done so well considering the subject matter...survivors of the 9/11 attack in NYC. The documentary follows the lives of 5 people and how their life stories unfold over the next 10 years. The film spends time with each of them and how they coped with such a horrible tragedy and loss of a loved one. Over the time span of 10 years it also shows how they started to heal, rebuild and live again."
5,These guys have IT!!!!!,"...Passion, soul, awesome talent!!! Make it a point to see them live!!! We saw them on the West Coast (Portland) and it was just cool serendipity...we found out they were from here in PA!! Best show we've seen in years, better than the ""big"" names!!! I'm anxious to buy their next cd when it comes out soon!! We hope to see them live here on the East Coast soon!!!"
4,Like it,It's a perfect helmet for displaying in the office. We tried to use it for a Halloween costume but had to remove the side cushioning to get it on my boy's head.
5,profound and prophetic insight into the enterprise of God,Roland Allen was a true prophet. He saw the things that needed to be pulled down in the sorry partnership between the gospel and colonial Brithish culture. He correctly saw the principles of Scripture and spoke them boldly at a time when not many people wanted to listen. This book brings fresh revelation to Christian ministry even after a hundred years of Holy Spirit restoration.
2,Not worth the money by a long shot,"This book did not even come close to covering all the objectives on the exam. The book briefly mentions the topics of the Auto-update server, the Pix Management Console, and the FWSM.... and when I say briefly, I mean a single paragraph and that's it. Make sure you know these objectives before taking the test! I failed the test by less than 50 pts, I am pretty sure had I known these items I would have passed easily. Search on Cisco's site for the documentation on these topics and make sure you know how to configure them and what tabs do what. I have over a year configuring dozens of Pix's for customers and have to say I was pretty dissapointed that I failed not from the cabability of installing and configuring Pix's, but because I didn't know what the support tab in the Pix MC did etc. Hope you have better luck than me!"
2,has to be a better one,It seems that there was a hurry to get books out before the new tests arrived. And this can hurt if you dish out money for an exam. I am disappointed in the ccsp series from cisco press. The book gives a good overview about the PIX but thats about it.
4,"Solid book, does have some proofreading mistakes...","As the previous reviewer noted, this book does contain some mistakes which should have been caught in proofreading. That being said, they are easily identifiable and do not take away from the overall content of this book. 5 stars on content, minus 1 star to the editor."
2,Frustrating,"I have read many of the Cisco Press books and have been generally pleased with the accuracy and coverage. Unfortunatly, this book has neither. I would like to think this is because the book was supposed to address the beta exam and the new Pix exam. Overall, this guide did not adequately address some of the objectives for the test. In addition, some of the test questions on the CD-ROM had incorrect answers. The book also had syntax errors in their examples. My suggestion would be to read the command reference, configuration guide and do some hands-on work or labs and save your money on this one. Hopefully a revised version on this book will be better...."
2,"Fine as a product manual, not enough for anything else","This book is perfectly fine for introducing you to the PIX product line and for giving you an overview of the commands, etc. But, that's about it. If it came free with the box, I'd be perfectly happy that Cisco included it. Beyond that, it's not of much use. It is really written from the perspective of describing what the firewalls are intended/supposed to do as opposed to assisting you with actaully configuring them in a production environment. And, certainly not enough to help you with the exam. ..."
2,Should have left this one in the oven longer...,"Most of the other reviews that cite the inaccuracies and errors in this book are accurate. This book really reads like it was rushed through writing and editing. The new products and relatively new portions of the exam are discussed at a pretty supreficial level, but nowhere near enough to help you pass the exam or work with this stuff in the real world. This results in a book that is at best insufficient and at worst downright wrong in many instances. It really feels like at the last minute they included the new exam and product coverage."
4,A little outdated now,"Good information in here. It's good if you're looking for a cheap way to study. When you upgrade to Pix OS 8 some of the commands are the same, but you implement them at different config levels. You will conf t and then int ethernet0 to configure the interfaces for example. With the older OS it's completely different (which the book contains information for).I recommend a newer book (or a revision) if you're actually studying for the test."
3,Fine if it had been proofread properly,"Wait for the next edition of this book is my advice. There are numerous errors in the text which some basic proofreading would have discovered and the exam provided with it is a joke, there are so many incorrect answers."
1,"Fair at best, very poor practice exam","The study guide is only moderately valuable, and sometimes confusing. Worse, the practice exam is sometimes blatantly incorrect.Example: What kind of protocol is easiest to spoof?Possible answers: UDP, TCP, ICMP, All protocols, or DNSThe ""correct"" answer is ""TCP is the more difficult to spoof...""I've found a few other errors, making the practice test virtually useless. In the example, the given answer is correct for a different question. In some cases, the answer is actually wrong for the question.I'm disappointed that an ""official"" study guide from Cisco Press has so many issues."
3,daunting,"This is a textbook designed for a one semester undergraduate course in cryptography. This makes it seem a little tamer than what it is. Crypto buffs will enjoy it, and there is little here than is not in some other advanced texts. What is of value is a section on RIJNDAEL, the new advanced encryption standard.Useful as a starting point but not as easy to follow as some other texts. You better like this stuff already or you shouldn't dive into this book."
2,OK- for your average Joe,"This works good for someone who just wants an easy thing you can plug in and go, but for me it wasn't a good solution. First, not only did I not want to use my cigarette lighter (I need it for a radar detecter) but I didn't want the speaker hanging off my my dashboard. Second, in my car (Audi A4) the cigarette lighter is in an awkward location near the gear shift. I have to place the speaker upside down to work, so the cables flop down the side. Third, the phone doesn't click in like a normal hands-free kit does, you have to stick two cables in the little holes each time you place it in the cradle. And fourth, you need to replace the battery cover with one that has a clip attached in order to attach to the cradle. This adds a little bulkiness to the phone for people who carry it in their pocket like I do.I don't know why Nokia can't make a real hard-wired hands-free kit for the 82xx phones like they did for the 61xx phones. The phones are becoming real popular."
3,The good and the bad,"As other reviewers, I wish Nokia would make a real car kit for the 82xx series. The big pain is that you always have to plug and unplug the power and speaker cables. I thought that all the plugging and unplugging had worn out the speaker/mic plug on my phone because the people that I called would complain about static that would go away if I moved the speaker plug slightly.Now I have a new phone and still the same probs. The power and speaker plugs are on a ""Y"" cable and Nokia made the speaker plug cable of the ""Y"" a little too long. This puts pressure on the phone's receptacle and causes the bad connection - poor engineering.Also, my car doesn't turn off the cig lighter's power when you turn off the ignition, so I always have to keep pulling it out of the cig lighter to turn it off.It's a shame that this is the only solution available from Nokia."
4,A very nice hands free kit,"This hands free kit is a great idea, it requires very little installation and it keeps your hands on the wheel while driving and talking. Be safe, use a hands free kit while driving"
5,A very good book,"I do not work directly in the field of automated inspection, so I need a book which introduces key concepts in the field without unnecessary derail. This book does just that. The ideas on features extraction and synergistic classification in the book have been invaluable in my research work. References given will be useful for those who seek further in depth understanding. The book is also useful for lecturers as it contains problems that can be used as examples in class or as the basis of exam questions. My AI course has benefited a great deal from the attached CD since it can be used directly to set up practical sessions in image processing. In short, both serious researchers and lecturers in the field ought to find the book very useful and beneficial."
1,This thing can't be raiting!!!!,Please dont thing that you are getting e book. Tthis thing is just 2 pages of useless document & I feel like a silly.
4,A willing suspension of disbelief,"The most gothic thing about this novel is its absolute refusal to stick to any sort of plausibility. Brautigan is matched only by Bradbury in his ability to create a completely new reality, explain the new rules (most of them absurd), tell a bunch of bald faced lies with a straight face, and convince the reader to go along with it. A pure celebration of the willingness to suspend disbelief. Occasionally I get the feeling he is not just entertaining me but trying to say something...who knows what?"
5,A masterpiece of existential horror,"If William Burroughs & Ken Kesey had a child, it would likely have ended up as Richard Braugtigan. Braugtigan is a writer who is both accessible and wildly unpredictable. His short novel THE HAWKLINE MONSTER is quite simply a masterpiece of existential terror. Two hired guns are brought to the wastelands of the Pacific Northwest to exterminate a ""monster"" living beneath the home of two very outre sisters. What they encounter is far more psychological than physical. Braugtigan quickly establishes a sense of dread but also manages to infuse the story with some very blunt humor. Brilliantly assembled via almost hypnotic prose, Braugtigan's book is extremeley involving, very entertaining and, though it will surely be dismissed by some as hippie mumbo jumbo, it's actually timeless."
3,Brautigan stumbles in a sci-fi western waste of time,"Richard Brautigan is without question one of the most inventive authors in the last thirty years. But his chief problem has always been consistency; some of his novels are passionate and creative, others feel like writing exercises. As you can probably tell, this is one of the latter. Here, Brautigan stumbles his two characters through a bizarre mad scientist plot which features a set of sisters who's identities are constantly changing, and who offer never-ending sexual fantasies. Right. Do yourself a favor. Blow off this one, and pick up ""In Watermelon Sugar,"" or almost any other Brautigan title. Profoundly disappointing"
3,"Interesting but a bit too ""trashy"" for my tastes","Well, I have heard all of my life that the thinking man's cult author is Brautigan. I finaly decided to search him out, and all I could find was the Hawkline Monster, which seemed like a good place to start, since I thought the idea of a western horror story would be novel indeed.What I found was a purposeful use (over-use) of the F--- word, lots of sex, and a run on of weird events. It seems like a story that COULD have been expanded on, or left alone.I want to hesitate in calling this trash, it is not. I myself am more inclined to stay away from such a book, so don't take my word for it. But, for those of you looking for existentialism, horror, and character development, look elsewhere."
2,"really, not that great","sure there can be alot of information that is useful, such as the doctors section, the limited dictionary maybe the handiest part... but for the rest there are loads of arbitrary phrases that dont really have much relevance. i dont really want to ask a person if i can kiss them, and then have NO IDEA what their response was. akward! thats kind of the overall gist of this book. missing alot, and needs an update"
5,Flat Out Fantastic,"If you have wondered where the great voices have gone, get a hold of this CD and wonder no more. Bettye LaVette sounds better than ever and the years have only served to give her greater command of what has always been a great set of pipes. Her voice is a magical mix of silk and sandpaper that grabs you and hits you deeply. The arrangements and productions are top notch, with nothing superfluous, and they serve as the perfect setting for the stunning vocals.This is not a ""soul"" CD. This is not an ""R&B"" CD. This is a simply a GREAT CD."
3,"Not as economical as the 11"" roll multi-packs.","It's a little less convenient but I find that it's simple (and a lot cheaper) to buy the 11"" rolls and cut them in half lengthwise for smaller items. The process is simple - just create a bag the way you normally would. The height of the bag is limited to the width of your foodsaver (usually it's 11-12 inches). Next flip the bag sideways and fold it in half to determine the mid-point. Finally, create two seals about 1/4"" on each side of the mid-point and use your cutter to divide the two bags at the mid-point. Voila! Now you've got two 5.5"" bags for smaller items!"
1,Very disappointing,The book was listed in very good condition & many many pages were loose & fell out as I turned the pages- not an accurate condition
4,space,this helped me free up more than enough space on my phone and it comes with an adapter so I can use it on my digital camera
4,Orange light means the battery is not properly connected!,"She's a great little charger, but a little on the hefty side. It looks kinda like a charger from about ten years ago. And the orange blinking light means that you haven't attached the battery properly for charging, and therefore it won't charge. That's it. No user's manual necessary. Anyway, it works just like it should, quickly and efficiently."
1,Kids just don't like it,Awful videos. I didn't believe previous reviewers about how annoying the company logo interjections were. Should have listened. Kids have no interest in watching this video. They watch it for a good 2 minutes. Haven't openned the case since. Total waste of money.
4,ok,"it is nice, but not the best. i was looking more for something like the app sing sing together. if somebody knows a dvd like that, let me know. thanks!"
5,Top 5 DVD's to have,My son loves this DVD and asks to watch it all the time! I enjoy that he watches other children sing along to the songs. The children act out most of the songs which has helped reinforce those skills for him.
5,A less violent Dave Robicheaux,"Mike's books remind me of James Lee Burke's Dave Robicheaux series. But without the gut wrenching violence. And he has not gotten stale yet as Grisham occasionally does. Great series worth reading from the start, but nothing really lost in any order. I do think you will be as hooked as I am if you try these."
5,THIS IS HOT,"THIS MUSIC IS FOR TODAY SO UPLIFTING. EVEN IF YOU ARE NOT IN THE CHURCH, IT HAS SOMETING ON IT FOR EVERYONE. BUY THIS ONE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE,YOU WILL NOT GO WRONGE. I'M TOO BLESSED TO BE STRESSED!"
1,just gotta know,I am trying to understand how Amazon can charge 17 dollars for 8oz of grated cheese. Anyone who orders this needs their head examined or something. This is one of the worst screws I have seen on Amazon to date. Its about 5 in most stores and cheaper in others so you figure it out. Just PUCKERUP cause you are getting kissed. HAHA
4,Good Pantry Staple - but it has it's limitations,"When I was very young I tried using this exceedingly dry cheese to make a sauce and I don't advise it. As I recall, it never did blend in smoothly and the result was rather grainy. Small grains but grainy lumps nonetheless. (Poor hubby- lol).But as something to keep in the pantry or fridge to throw on top of spaghetti, garlic toast, a salad, or into meatloaf at the last minute, it's great.Three and a half Stars. Kraft Parmesan Cheese has it's place in the kitchen. Not so much as a source of Alfredo sauce, but rather as a condiment.Reasonably priced. Long shelf life means you have a fall back position if your block Parmesan has gone too moldy. Unlike some brands there are no `fillers'. Only two preservatives; one to preserve flavor, the other to prevent caking."
1,Kraft Foods RIPOFF,"Kraft Foods has taken it upon themselves to reduce the amount of Parmesan Cheese in their plastic jars. Now instead of the contents reaching to the top, there is now roughly a 1 inch gap of open space in each jar, and as a purchaser of this product for over 40 years, I am furious !!!Even though the new jars are marked down to $2.99, give them a few months and they will be charging the consumers for a FULL BOTTLE !!!I will no longer buy this Product nor the same exact one manufactured by KROEGER !"
3,Needed my parmesan fix,Total impulse buy I'm afraid. The cheese is fine. I just ended up paying double for the product compared to the local grocer.
4,great egg pan,love this pan for eggs and reheating home fries.it will usually last a year or 2 with average care.i highly recommend at least 2 of this kind of pan on hand.
4,Black strap molasse,Have been using black strap molasse and found it effective against constipation . Hope it will be as effective against all the other disorders mentioned in the booklet.
5,Great book,My husband was diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis but he has been re diagnosed and no longer has it?He has been a firm believer in God's healing and Black strap molasses... I am not saying it healed him But its agreat book and we are daily drinkers of this and Apple cider vinegar.
1,Ridiculous.,"This book is just ridiculous. I wouldnt waste the money. All of the benefits are listed as anecdotal stories about people ""way back when."" There's nothing scientific or even based in fact. This is the first time I have ever rated something one star. :("
3,Cheap!,"The instructions that came with this sprayer did not make it clear how to assemble the sprayer head. My clever husband did eventually figure out how to assemble it and how to make it stop leaking around the spray control, but had trouble attaching the plumbing splitter tightly enough to keep it from leaking at the water source. The low-quality plumbing splitter broke while he was trying to tighten it and will have to be replaced. Also, the included hose for connecting the sprayer to the toilet is not long enough if the water source is on the opposite side of the toilet from where the water enters the toilet. We will probably replace the part that we broke and attempt to use it, but taking into account the disclaimer that came with this product that the life of the product may be shortened because of high water pressure, I'm not expecting it to last long. My advice: spend the extra [...] bucks and get a quality one that will last!"
2,Does anyone have contact information?!,I am trying to reach Bidet Ole but only have an e mail address... does anyone have a phone number for them?thank you!
1,LEAKED BADLY,"Had purchased a similar sprayer (more expensive) for one of my daughters & she loves it, so bot one (NOT the same sprayer)from this vendor & it never did work well...it leaked badly, fittings were broken...my son-in-law just went to hardware store & purchased parts so they could use it...too bad...won't purchase the ""Bitet Ole"" again! A waste of time & money."
4,Excellent reference book for developing training.,We used this book in out graduate program at Penn State. It quickly provides detailed information for every step of the instructional design process. It is a good text to learn about training and an even better reference book for later use.
3,Mastering the Instructional Design Process,It is a bit dry and what seems to be common knowledge. This text discusses a subject until it is completely dead. It would have been nice to have more case studies and examples showing how the process was used practically because the actual process does not seem that complicated. At least it seems like most people already do most of the steps in their head.
4,Excellent review of the ISD process,Rothwell and Kazanas provide a thorough explanation of the Instructional Design process. It is very useful and informative for beginners and novices. The only detraction is the sole focus on ISD. There are many other ways to design educational programs. One approach to design is not always the best method.
3,Skills / training focus,"If you're looking for a decent textbook on ISD from a skill development / training perspective, this is a good choice. But know that the focus is almost exclusively on job performance. It offers almost nothing on using ISD to achieve cognitive goals, learning in an academic environment, or education (vs. training) in the classical sense."
1,Angry Customer,"I paid for expedited shipping and yet I have not received my pacakge. Tracking shows wrong address, yet I have received my other text books."
1,Unwatchable,"This DVD is unwatchable. The transfer is so awful and so dark, you'd be better off renting this on VHS, if you even know what that means.I actually recorded this via TiVo off cable television, and my recording is 1000x better than this crappy DVD!CAVEAT EMPTOR!P.S. Why won't Amazon allow 0 star ratings?"
4,WHAT A MOVIE,la street fighters is one of the best gang movie ive seen & the best gang movie in the 80's i saw it in 1987 havent seen it since cant find it any where till now it is worth the trouble looking for it
4,Of course this is an example of sick turntablism.,"Although with Qbert(arguably the #1 Turntablist in the world) how could it not be eh? The only thing I couldn't understand is where the ""Vs Klams Uv Deth"" comes in. I could not determine a battle on the record, so I suppose this is just a title, one that doesn't make alot of sense. Or possibly I'm just deaf."
4,Great - but incomplete,"I love Ruth Langan. I enjoy her writing and I enjoy how she writes books about entire families. This bundle is good, but incomplete. They left the characters of Shaw, Sutton and Flame books out of the collection. so, while I'm glad I got this and recommend it; I wish there had been a ""complete"" Highlanders Bundle."
2,Not so toddler-tough,"My daughter got this for her 2nd birthday. Within minutes, the cover of the drum was broken. She was not extra-rough with it. It is just very poorly-made. Surprising for Melissa & Doug."
5,Great mix of instruments,"I'm probably writing this too early because it's a Christmas gift so we haven't opened the box yet (so I can't comment on the durability) but I'm 100% sure it's going to be fun. It's got a great mix of different instruments for sharing and I know my son is going to love it. I'm controlling myself not to ruin his Christmas gift because I wanted to give it to him as soon as it arrived. It's nice to have a ""noisy"" toy that isn't noisy from batteries. Hopefully it will be durable. Like that it is literally a band in a box in that it comes with a box to throw it all into when it's cleanup time."
5,WONDERFUL for my 3 yr old...,"The deluxe band-in-a-box set is by far the greatest... Although hope you have enough people available because everyone has their own instrument... We had a blast with this set, the kids love it, and even the adults had some good laughs.. very sturdy and holds up against the worst wear and tear.. Highly recommend for your young child..."
4,Nice set and good for kids,"This is a nice set and comes in a great wooden box.My only complaint is that some of the pieces (the cymbals) had discolored and a little rust on them. Not sure why, but other than that, everything was in good condition and great for little kids to play."
4,be ready for noise,"My daughter received this set when she was almost 2. She loves banging the instruments together to make as much noise as possible. The paper on the tamborine broke after the first day, she wanted it to be a drum! Overall it's a great way for her to make music."
3,disappointed,"We recently bought this item for our two year old, but on the way home from the store, he managed to tear the tamborine top. Now, two days later, the paper has huge gaping holes in it. I guess I read the reviews too late, but maybe I can call the company, get a replacement, and immediately put the packing tape over it. It's a shame the company doesn't read these posts, though, since they should change their product. Another problem I had with it was the weak sound of the maracas. One has no beans in it at all, apparently! My husband thought that maybe we could drill a hole in it and put some rice inside. We already had a storage bin for musical toys, but we are using the crate for plastic food storage.Anyway, this is my first time writing a review about a product, since I don't like registering my name with internet companies to do so, but this toy motivated me to complain in a public forum!"
4,Good toy,I bought this for my grand daughter since she likes music. It is three weeks. she is still playing with it.It is very durable and it is a good toy.
2,Pretty disappointing,"I love all the Melissa and Doug stuff I have gotten for my 2 year old daughter, so was pretty bummed when this arrived. The maracas are pretty lame (sounds like 3 pieces of rice are inside), the cymbals don't make a very good sound and the quality is sub-par. We have made the best of it and have fun singing funny songs together, but wouldn't buy this again or get it for anyone as a present."
1,VERY disappointing,"I used to be a big fan of Melissa and Doug toys, but I have been very disappointed with some of those we got for Christmas. Especially this music se is absolutly useless. The thin paper on the tambourine tore 10 minutes after we took it out of the box, the egg shakers barely make any noise, it actually sound as if the inside beans were wet, and the cymbals don't work either. So the only thing that is quite nice about this set is the triangle and the red noise maker.If you wand some good quality instruments for your child, go to west music store here on amazon and find all the instruments separately, the price you spend will be equal to this set and you will be much happier with the products {I got lolipop drum, egg shakers, triangle, cymbals with knobs and tambourine and it is uncomperable quality!!!!}"
1,Already Broken After One Week,"My children are not the type to break their toys because they are too rough with them. That is why I was surprised when after only a week of owning the music instruments there are several instruments that are already broken and can no longer be used to make music. The tambourine (drum part)ripped right away, and the hollow wood instrument cracked and split in two. I would not recommend this product."
4,nice set,i got this set for my daughter and the B toys set for my other daughter. this one is nice but the maracas are much quieter than expected. if you are looking for a cute band set check out the b toys one. its more money but sooooo adorable!
4,great but not as awesome as I wish,"All the instruments were pretty cool except for the marracas. They make almost no noise and that was what i was looking forward the best.Overall, my daughter loved all the instruments!"
3,Not as loud as I thought!,"Very good quality product, but a bit disappointed in the overall performance for some reason. My two year old liked all of the products except the maracas (probably because they are very quiet - which isn't necessarily a bad thing) but she isn't really into the tiny symbols or wooden block (again both are not very loud). She does love the triangle so the entire band was worth it just to get the triangle."
5,Great music instruments for children,"I would recommend this product to all parents that want to introduce music to their toddlers. My little one has a really good time playing with these instruments, she thinks they are just toys without realizing she is playing instruments.I really like this product."
4,Made in China,"A little disappointed. I thought that they made their stuff in the USA, but everything I saw said Made in China. I might need to do a bit more research next time. The quality of the products vary. I'm not too excited about this purchase. Maybe look in your local area to see if someone locally makes wooden instruments."
1,DO NOT BUY!!,"I wish I had read all the reviews. The tambourine broke immediately!. The maracas and cymbals are barely audible. Very poor quality, disappointing for Melissa and Doug."
4,My kids love it!,"This is a great music set. My 2 and 3 year old love it. My only real complaint is about the maracas. The handles of the maracas unscrew pretty easily. It's nothing that a dab of wood glue shouldn't be able to fix, but there's a clear seam between the two pieces of wood that separate. The beads inside the maraca don't come out, thank goodness! Also - the maracas are quite quiet. Very difficult to hear over the other instruments if more than one is being played with at a time.Aside from the issues with the maracas, this is a lovely set that I highly recommend!"
3,Not durable,The tambourine paper top broke within the first two days we had it. The planned on taking the paper off to just let him shake it and I wound up getting cuts on my hand from the jagged edges. Happy I found that out and not my son.UPDATE 12/21/12 - The clapper thing has broken apart numerous times. The quality of these are just overall disappointing.
4,Basic noise makers,"These are your basic noise makers. As usual, they were the #1 toy for a few hours or days (now relegated to the ""music stuff"" box). The tambourine ""drum"" broke after a few days, due to rough-housing by a visiting older friend, not due particularly to quality in my opinion."
4,Fun,"We have really enjoyed this set with our 1 year old and 2 year old. There is enough variety that everyone can find a few things at their level to play. We bought this set because Grandma has one, so I was a little disappointed to find that this set was cheaper made than the one she bought a few years ago. Ours is less musical, especially the cymbals, but it still makes plenty of happy noise, so overall, we feel it was a good purchase."
5,Great Family Rhythm Band,"As a grandmother I enjoy giving christmas presents each year to keep in own home for the grandchildren to play with when they come and visit. For years I have wanted to have a rhythm band. This was the introduction to a fun evening which ended up with not only each grandchild choosing an instrument from this collection, but Grandpa pulling out his banjo, saxaphone and guitar that had been collecting dust. Each child ages 2 to 13 enjoyed playing along with their chosen instruments. The Grand Finale was Grandpa, again, playing ragtime at the piano. Each instrument is well made and sturdy. It was a great addition to the holidays with all family members present. I would highly recommend this product to anyone wanting to get their children or grandchildren involved in music. They enjoyed taking turns and trading instruments. There were no favorites. Each was a fun and unique experience for each child"
4,Lots of noisy fun!,"My 2 year old and 4 year old daughters love these instruments. The clapper is hard for them, but the rest are great. We put on some music, and they play along. It's fun!"
3,Price could be better,"Cute item. The ""instruments"" Look better than how they sound. Had lots of fun with them however. A bit pricey for what they are."
3,Mediocre,"I am normally quite a fan of Melissa & Doug toys. Unfortunately, this one did not meet those expectations.- The maracas are very quiet. The child must shake them quite hard to hear the sound.- The hand cymbals sound very muted if you clap them together cleanly. You have to do so on an angle for it to make the proper sound.- The wooden noisemakers are also very quiet- The triangle is good- The tambourine is our child's favorite."
5,Great Toy!!,"My son received this set as a gift for his second birthday several years ago, and has just loved it! We bought one to give to my nephew this Christmas, and I am sure he will love it too. The instruments are surprisingly durable, and my son is really rough on his toys! I even found the little wooden clacker thing outside behind our storage shed covered in mud, and when I rinsed it off, it looked as good as new. I was impressed! I would absolutely recommend this to people!"
1,Garbage,"Can't say I'm disappointed -- angry is more appropriate. Looks good but is terrible. The quality of this product is so poor, I am quite certain that the folks at Melissa and Doug never held these things in their hands, but only saw photos when deciding to package and market them. The ""skin"" on the tambourine lasted 30 seconds. The maracas seem durable, but make nearly no sound at all. The triangle is flat-out dangerous. The mini-hand cymbal things make a horrible thwunk sound when clapped together... I could go on an on but will just say that everything except for the wooden tray(which we will use in the kitchen) and the torn tambourine went straight to the trash.Save your money and time and buy something else. While the wooden nature of the products are appealing -- I'm now avoiding Melissa and Doug products altogether as the are obviously very poor quality."
3,The tamborine tore in 1 month,"Overall, this set is okay. The sound quality is a little disappointing - the cymbals have a muted quality and the maracas are pretty quiet too. The wooden ridged thing with the stick was perplexing to us and others have said the same. We just can't figure out what it is supposed to do. But, the set does the job to entertain my baby just fine. One instrument has already suffered an injury, though. We purchased this product a month ago and today, I found the paper part of the tamborine torn. It was either my 10 month old or her 3 year old friend who was over this weekend, but either way, it didn't hold up very long. I probably wouldn't buy this product again, but for $15, you get what you pay for."
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed with this product. The shakers did not shake (i.e. they were so filled with sand or whatever else is inside them that they did not make much noise) and the symbols make very little noise at all other than a boring ""clank"". It is a pity because with a little more effort this could have been a great product."
2,Broke after two days : (,"The tambourine broke after two days, the company, Melissa and Doug sent me a new one. It was defective, there was supposed to be a hard cardboard underneath and it was missing."
2,Falling apart in less than a month,"The maracas cracked and split open and had to be thrown away. After minimal use, the chrome plating on the outside of the triangle is peeling off--a danger to households with a baby. The cymbals were tarnished when we received the set. The box is worthless. With no lid on the box, you can't store the items in it. When we made the purchase we were concerned that the price was too good to be true. It was. These are not quality products, and don't live up to occasional use by a 3-and-a-half year old.."
4,Good deal,"Triangle & cymbals are the big hit with my 12 month old, but the other instruments are great too. The only thing I'm not impressed with is the tamborine since the ""skin"" part is not made with leather but with a synthetic material that I don't think will be long-lasting. Still, a great price for a good variety of instruments."
1,Very poor quality,"I was excited to get this set for my 1 1/2 yr. old daughter. It was such a great idea! What a disappointment! The maracas make no sound, as if they are filled too full, the tamborine skin broke after only one week and even the wooden rhythm instrument and cymbals produce such a weak sound, they hardly sound like percussion instruments. It is all made in China. I think I'm better off getting ""real"" instruments that produce quality musical sounds to inspire my daughter. I do not recommend this set to anyone."
3,10 minutes of noise in a box,"My two year old son received this as a gift for Christmas. I think if I could do it over again, I would have set this aside unopened until he was older. Within 10 minutes he was bored and started banging on his toys with the stick instrument. Not to mention he made a hole in the tamborine's surface with the triangle's chimer stick. I think the surface is just a paper material. Educationally, it's what you make of it. As someone with no musical ability or knowledge about instruments, my son is left to just make noise with the items. Anyway, I'm hoping he will enjoy it more appropriately next year. For now, it's going back in the closet."
2,Disappointed,"Pretty durable, good educational toy but that's about all I can say thats positive about it! I would definitely not recommend this! I was debating about the more expensive brand even though Melissa &Doug are usually pretty good quality, but now that I have purchased this and have seen the quality of the other brand! I would have definitely paid the extra to get the other! Oh well! The symbols dont even make a symbol sound! Prettty lame if you ask me! Comes in a super cheap cheesy container with fake grass in it! weird?!!! I thought so too!"
4,Kids Fun,This is A cute toy for kids. I think many kids will like this toy. It's fun to play with instuments! So why don't you buy this for your kids?
4,Excellent Skill Builder,Purchased for a childs 4th birthday. He and his frined love to play music and take turns sharing the instruments. Each one has their Debut as a soloist on the instrument of choice and have learned to incorporate voice as well. We highly recommend!
5,Wonderful toy,I bought this for my one year old. He loves making noise and this was the perfect gift. He's too young for the triangle but appreciates everything else. This comes in a cute wooden box where you can try to keep everything neat. I recommend this as a gift. - Noga Rosenthal
4,Great for GrandKids,"It makes a lot of noise and the grand kid loved it LOL. I wish this was made anywhere but China, but it is not."
4,Cute Little Gift,Purchased this as a gift for my 3 year old nephew. Includes a nice little assortment of instruments for him to experiment with as he learns about music. Makes a great gift.
3,"Good idea, but what's up with the maracas???","We like these instruments and, like most M & D products, they're nice and good quality. But the ones I thought my 11-month-old would like the best, the maracas (since it's still hard for him to hold the triangle or properly use the cymbals....but he can shake stuff with the best of them), barely make any sound at all! I have no idea why, but they're made so that there's just a tiny whisper when you shake them, not at all like other maracas. Why in the world would you make a child's toy so boring, especially if it must be super easy to make maracas that make a decent sound (I can use an empty can and some coins and create better maracas type of instruments!). Very disappointed and puzzled!"
1,cheap materials...VERY poorly constructed,"my 1year old daughter has already put a hole through the tamborine after dropping it and it landed on a pebble *while playing with it at her birthday party and just received it moments before..i might add*, the clacker thing is held together with a cheap piece of elastic rope...which she has already undone and lost the 1 piece..the maracas are bad...they're not loud or any thing..it sounds like there are 4 or 5 grain of rice inside..and the wooden instrument...she has no interest in it musically...but she likes chewing on them....the symbols, and triangle are ok ...simply due to they make sharp loud noise...which is what she likes...i'm not happy with this purchase AT ALL..."
4,Everything you need to make some noise,"Loved everything in the box, this is a really great set for kids.I only have a few issues:1.) The maracas are very quiet. Maybe put some larger beans in there?2.) The tambourine broke after a few hits, I just super glued it back together and it works great, but still :)Overall though it's lots of fun and the kiddo loves it!"
4,Musical fun!,"This was a christmas present for my 3 year old, and she loves it! We have fun playing marching band and making different sounds. I haven't had any problems with quality, although my daughter is fairly gentle with her toys."
4,Musical Fun in a Box!,"All 3 of my kids love these instruments. They are ages 7, 5, and 1 and all of them find interesting uses for them. We memorize scripture, poems, and other things while playing a beat. We march around the house making music along with our CDs. The best part is that they are so sturdy. They have held up under some severe use and abuse by our 1 year old. He loves the triangle best. I do wish it had a drum or some finger symbals in the box, but other than that, I really like it."
3,Not impressed...,"I normally really like Melissa & Doug toys but this one was a bit of a disappointment.My son (2.5) has only had it for about 2 hours and already the tamborine cover is ripped and there is paint missing from the moraccas.He enjoys the toys, but I feel like they aren't as well made as other Melissa & Doug toys we have. Luckily I got it at a great price or I'd be very disappointed.."
1,Poor Quality,This toy looks like great fun but its poor quality is no fun!! I've always like M & D toys but I question their quality controls. Would not recommend as they break easily & become a safety hazard.
1,Waste of money and toybox space,"The maracas cant be heard from more than 5 inches away, the cymbals are tiny and sound like soup-can tops, the wooden rhythm instrument is nearly as silent as the maracas. The only thing that works correctly is the tamborine, but the cheapness of the construction materials rings loud and clear. Will not recommend this to anyone in the future. We plan on going to Toys R Us and getting their set, which we have played with and sounds more like actual musical instruments."
1,Dangerous if poorly made toy breaks,"My son enjoyed making music with these toys, until the cover of the tambourine broke with light tapping of the triangle stick. The trouble was, the tears were very jagged and the material is very sharp when ripped. I pulled the rest of it off but it didn't completely come off and is too sharp and jagged to play with. I emailed Melissa and Doug twice and they did not respond. I will probably not purchase another toy from them after this poor customer service experience."
4,Well-made toy for all ages!,"My son got this for Christmas when he was 3- it was a huge hit! Now, at 5 and a half, he still plays with this regularly, and has recruited his 1-yr old sister to ""play band"" with him. I agree with the other reviewer who mentioned the triangle stick could be dangerous for the younger set, but my one-yr old prefers the cymbals anyway. Yes its loud, but great fun and great for teaching rhythms and developing musical interest. The clacker instrument did break from being smacked against the concrete outside, but everything else has held up for 2 years now. As usual I'm very impressed with Melissa & Doug's products!"
4,3/4nylox end brush,"I use Nyalox brushes for cleaning bark off material used for log furniture. They work pretty good for getting in those hard to reach knotty areas and they dont scar soft wood such as pine like wire brushes do. Orange and gray work best for me, blue is to soft."
4,Interesting perspective,"I always thought of Mary as being very different from a regular person. This musical shows a side of her that I've never thought about, but could be true. She must have had the same feelings and issues as any unmarried girl from a very religious family would have today. No one talks about Mary's mother either, but she had one! Interesting thoughts about what her mother's reaction would have been to her pregnancy. While some of the dialogue was a bit ""corny"", it did make me think and challenge my preconceived ideas. The music was very moving. I especially liked how the author brought it all together in the finale."
1,anti-Semitic drivel,"This CD is an offense to anyone with religious sensibilities. The mother of the Virgin Mary is portrayed as a nagging, stereotypical Jewish harpie, complete with a hokey (and historically incorrect) Yiddish accent. One wonders if the sequel will include the 3 Wise Men, with Baltazar tap dancing and eating watermelon. Save your money!"
1,Stereotypical disgrace,"This ""musical"" is an amateurish attempt to portray a real story. But the characters are so poorly fleshed out and the music is so amateurish, it falls flat.More troubling is the fake Yiddish accent put on by the characters that give it an historical distortion, but also seems almost anit-semetic in its portrayal of whiny, negative women who are based on every stereotype available.The writers obviously have no sense of Jewish history and no fear of appearing foolish in their attempt to identify real events.Oy--this is a stereotypical disgrace."
2,Terrible After a Few Episodes,"This show was interesting for the first few episodes then it became repetitive and absolutely boring. I watched up to episode 20 hoping that it would get better, but then gave up. What a stinker it became."
4,"A little surreal, but cute","My teenager loves this show, and I have fun watching it with him. While I've discussed pregnancy and all that good stuff with him a long time ago, it still opens more dialogue. It's also entertaining,and has some realism to it - but, really, how many pregnant teens have two guys fighting over them? It would have been more realistic if she was on her own, and would probably dissuade teens from the dream of having babies because they're cute and all if she had to do it herself. I guess that doesn't make for as much drama though.I like how the show touches on all potential ways of dealing with an unexpected pregnancy. I also like that she choses to keep her baby - too often media makes adoption look so wonderful instead of portraying it as it really is for the birthmother.The teen actors are pretty good for the most part. Again, a little overly dramatized, even for teenagers, but that aside it is cute."
1,worst show ever,"This show is pure propaganda and plain horrible. The acting is dreadful, the plot is laughable and there is not 30 seconds that goes by without the mention of ""sex"". Of course all the guys in this are cast as sex hungry jerks and the girls as naive. I will not spoil the predictable plot, but of course every situation involves sex and how it is bad. The worst plotline is the one where the chick had protected sex and liked it, and her dad died rushing to stop her. How dumb. They should have paid infomerical rates for this one."
1,Boring - Same thing over & over,"Wish I didnt waste my money on this, its about a bunch of teenagers having sex and then be unhappy about it afterwards or having sex because there unhappy in the first place.It's really a waste of time, k bye."
2,Unintentionally Funny,"Secret Life: it's the prego-craze (eg. Juno, Knocked Up, Waitress) turned into a TV show, with a heavy dose of 7th Heaven, a pinch of ensemble-cast drama, and the acting giant that is Molly Ringwald. Sounds like an instant success, right?Wrong.Thanks to atrocious writing and mediocre acting, situations that should be dramatic become unintentionally funny. Few of the actors manage to make their lines believable, a task which is near-impossible because of the unnatural dialogue that has been written for them. Incidences that should be dramatic--a girl telling her mother that she's pregnant, a Christian girl's Down syndrome brother discovering that her boyfriend is cheating--become downright hilarious. Ultimately, the characters become caricatures of themselves, and it's impossible for a viewer to take them seriously.I watched this show because I found it good in a really BAD sort of way. If you're expecting this show to be good in a serious way, you're in for a disappointment."
1,totally unrealistic.,"This is the most unrealistic show I have ever seen. I can't think of anything good to say about it. The acting is horrible, and the writing is even worse. All the kids are supposed about to be about 15ish, yet they all seem to have the most mature conversations, the kind of conversations you would expect from say, a Lifetime movie of the most boring kind. The kids always have some sound advice for each other, which always ends up being school counselorish, and has the other one saying something like "" Thanks for being there for me, it's nice to know I have a friend like you."" Who talks like that, at 15? No gossip, no backstabbing, everyone supports everyone else. Please. This show has no realism."
5,A really good young adult drama,I as a 22 year old find this show to be so dramatic that you really can't look away. Its ment for all ages not just teenagers. Despite what people think child rearing is hard for EVERYONE regardless of age and this show will seriously make you see some changes especially if you are thinking about having children.
4,Secretly Addictive...,"I missed the very first episode (could have kicked myself!) but luckily have been watching on cable from episode two onwards. It is from the same creator as 7th Heaven (my favourite show) but The Secret Life of the American Teenager is much spicier than its predecessors. Following Amy through the ordeal of falling pregnant at 15 after only having sex once, the show covers closely how Amy deals with such a 'dirty secret' whilst finding out who her true friends are and learning that family always come first. A very colourful show with a good-looking cast (never hurts!). Worth the watch!9/10."
5,:),"Bought this since i am a HUGE secret life fan. The disks were all there, they all work. I am happy with my purchase."
5,So different !!,"The last album from Indochine is really different from the other ones. It's really good and contains songs they had never played live(7000 danses, A l'est de Java, More). I saw that unplugged concert and the CD is exactly like the concert : great !!!"
1,This isnt just stand-up,I didnt like this tape at all.Most of these comedians i really like & i thought i would enjoy this tape.It shows a couple minutes at most of each ones stand up routine.Its more of a back stage interview with each comic.
1,A Review of Female Comedians from Yesteryear,"This was a real disappointment. No routine lasts more than a few minutes. Lots of interviews. Old humor (Lucy in the grape crushing vat, again). It's more about female comedians trying to make it in stand-up and their struggles, (which is what is discussed in the interviews), than great performances."
4,Impressive,"This is a comical, laugh-out-loud, kind of stand up comedy that makes you want to watch it again and again."
3,The Cross & the Swastika,"I was very happy with how long it took to arrive etc but I thought the quality of the book was a bit poor for the price. ""Used"" can mean any number of things I suppose."
4,Mammoth Book games,"I realized too late that this book was only 416 pages, not the original 510 pages so it omitted several of the (less popular?) games. Otherwise, it is a great book with many uses for all ages and abiliiesBarbara"
3,Misleading,"I bought this for my son for Christmas because he wanted the new VideoNow but already has a Game Boy Advance. I figured that this would be just as good. Well, it won't work. The box states that it's not compatible with other Game Boy systems or the Game Boy Player accessory. Nowhere on his Game Boy does it say ""player accessory,"" but the video won't play, showing on the screen that it won't play on a ""player accessory."" I'm at a loss for what to do now."
5,Auto excellence,"Great gauge set. Unobtrusive, yet easy to see and read. Superb mounting system with a screw on ring on the back of the gauge. Very bright and clear numbers. Everything included to do the installation."
5,You're a Brave Man Julius Zimmerman,"You're a Brave Man, Julius Zimmerman is one of the most funniest books I have ever read. It was so funny I could not put it down! It's about a boy named Julius Zimmerman who thought he was going to have a good time this summer,Wrong! He had to baby-sit and take French lessons not what he expected. He had to baby-sit a boy named Edison Blue a three year old who is not even potty-trained! He also had to take French lessons which he knew nothing about he didn't even know his own name in French. You have to read this book!"
4,Great overall,I have had the Dock N Talk for 3 years and just love it. With my Nokia 3285 it even picks up the phone automatically so I never have to touch the phone while I'm driving.
2,it started out like a good product,"I bought this product and now I must send it back. One of the little prongs on the cord broke off, and remained in the bottom of my phone. Fortunately after much effort I was able to remove this prong from my phone. It seems that many of the other reviews share the same problem with this item. Also, the fitting to the phone is not secure, so if you move the phone the wrong way, the cord comes out. I think this could be a good product if these problems were resolved by the company."
1,Never again,"The first one I bought (from here) quit in about a month. I think the connection at the speaker end of the cable was intermittent. It was so convenient when it did work that I bought another and in about a month it became erratic, too. ""Fool me once....etc."""
1,"Connector breaks easily, whole unit must be replaced","This unit worked great...for the 1st two weeks of regular use. Then the tiny plastic connectors holding it to the handset broke, rendering it useless. I see no replacement plug for sale. Now I know why they give away coupons making this item essentially free. Too bad, it otherwise seemed pretty good."
1,Should be built better,too fragile and tempermental an item...needs better quality control and manufacturing
2,review,i was disappointed in this cd- i expected to hear a largevariety of music.most of the songs were not the chart toppers I remeber listening to as a young woman.
4,Great except for the price!,"I have almost exclusively used these diapers for my baby since he was born(7 months old now) and really love them. The one week I used other diapers, I realized just how much I liked the Seventh Generation diapers. My son developed a diaper rash with the conventional diapers, and I was annoyed because I could never smell when he had gone to the bathroom because of all the masking fragrance (which means chemicals) that were used. I chose Seventh Generation because I wanted something that was more friendly to my son's body as well as more environmentally friendly. However, the only reason I am giving it a ""4"" rating is because they are very expensive. Amazon used to sell them much cheaper than Whole Foods but now they are the same price (a 50% increase in price!), which has been a lot harder on our budget! Otherwise they are wonderful!"
3,Looks like they made them out of recycled paper...,The diapers were light brown and looked like they were made from recycled paper. They were also as rough as paper bags.
4,Most absorbent disposable natural diaper,"When my son was born, I used cloth diapers (motherease.com - awesome), and as he got older, it was easier to use disposables. The reason I went with the cloth one was I didn't want the chemicals in the disposable diapers touching my babies privates. These diapers work better than the other natural diapers. They rarely leak - and then they do, it's because I didn't put them on right for the overnight soakings that were to come. Most of the time though - they're great. Nothing beat the cloth diapers, but as far as the convience factor - they're the ones I use."
5,PLEASE DON'T DISCONTINUE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"These are the only disposable diapers I feel comfortable putting on my 10 month old. They are chlorine bleach free and fit extremely well, lasting through a twelve hour night with no leaks! Amazon is the only reliable source I've found for these diapers and it will be devastating if they are no longer available. If not for me, for the Earth!"
1,Unhappy shopper!!!,"Purchased item on 5/31/2011. Got a email from amazon about my order, Called DSC and was kept on hold for about 3 min and then was told that the product that I ordered was on back order. Even though they still have it listed as in stock. Do yourself a favor and order it from somewhere else..."
5,This is a good product.,"Natural sterol complex works really good. I got really nice cuts and got a lot stronger since I started using this. I recomend it to people who are looking to get cut, it really gives you good looking pumps but you have to work out though. You can't expect this to do wonders. You have to lift some weights and you will be very pleased."
2,ok,"Honestly I have trouble downing as much as six of these a day. No lie they are truly a horse pill, I don't have that much trouble downing them, but they do have kinda a garlicky taste to them, and I have gagged a few times. As far as performance and them doing what they are advertised to do? Well I have to give this one a negative review for performance. I gained pretty much nothing on these guys. Although read other reviews, maybe there just not for me."
5,Nice gains.,"Takes a little while but, I noticed nice gains in muscle size after a few weeks. Gives me a lot more energy and that ""aggressive"" feeling when lifting. I've bought this product several times now."
1,Just BCAAs,Universal makes good products but this didn't work for me. The reason people are getting results is probably because they haven't taken branch chain ammino acids. Thats all I chalked this product to.
5,It stirs the heart,"I came across Sue Harrisons My Sister the Moon by accident, a friend had left it behind in my home. From the first page to the frantic search for the sequel I absolutely love this book. I felt such a connection with Kiin, because their customs and life are so similar to my own Heritage of being maori. It shows Mana Wahine (Womens Prestige,Power and independence) It is a book that i recommend to my friends and family. I read this book when i seek comfort, solace and relief. It is like an oasis that restores my energy and empowers me to keep doing what i do. Thankyou so much Sue Harrison"
5,"Great Cd, but takes a few listens",When I listened to the samples of this cd I wasn't sure how good it would be. But after buying it I am convinced this is a great band. The singer gets a little light at times but thats no biggy. Each person in the band actually does have talent at the instrument they play so its not a bunch of junk mixed together. Kirk Hammet from Metallica shows up on SuckerPunch and delivers and awesome solo. This album is definatly worth buying.
4,A good listen,"This album is fresh and new...Kind of a different sound then what is typical these days...No Nu Metal or Metal RAP.Poppy without being cheesy...Catchy without sounding cliche....Good job Jason & CO....I have only spun it a few times in my car so I don't have a song by song breakdown....But its catchy, fresh, trippy, driven music....Parts of the songs remind me a bit of Jane's Addiction...PArticuraly the 2nd track..The music builds and takes on a jam feel with the singer singing the same melody over and over...However, the feeling is dreamy not repitive....A few of the later tracks kind of run together and don't stand out upon the first few listens which is why I didn't give it a 5...but this is one of the few albums (Yes I still call them that)...from a ""New"" group that I can spin and enjoy.Pickledjoe"
2,hmmm... definitely NOT a rock album,"I have to say that I did think Jason would come a lot heavier. I'd give this album a one star but there is some evidence of life that occassionally tries to shine. I just cant believe he'd go into such a laid back alternative stupor. I wish him luck, but this THING is going back to the store. Sorry Jason but don't count on my money."
2,"potential, but not much to inspire me for now","I was a bit shocked when I heard this album. I knew I wasn't going to get a new Metallica, but where this came from I don't know. I think the music has the potential to grow into something more solid and higher quality. I can't explain what is missing other than to say it didn't FEEL all that great to me. For the most part I heard too stripped down, underplayed music. The vocals are descent, but a little coaching and I think they'll be good quality. Good luck Jason & guys. I hope the next one is better."
1,"A black, black day for metal fans.","This has probably been one of the biggest let-down's that I have ever have listening to music. I thought that Jason was a true, heartfelt, metalhead, and I couldn't have been any more incorrect. As I listened to the boring, annoying music that echoed out of my cd-player, my jaw was dragging the floor in utter shock. The whole reason I became such a fan of music was because of Metallica. And now Jason has converted over to the pop music realm, playing music for those Ambercrombie and Fitch wearin' preppies. If you are a fan of Metallica, and you like music that actually gets you pumped up, I warn you, stay as far away from this cd as you can, it will save you the heartache. I feel bad saying this about Jason, as I am a big fan of his PREVIOUS WORK, but he has completely wrecked my dreams of the survival of good metal music, soon enough all the music will sound the same....Fuel, Default, Echobrain... all the same. No heart."
5,Like a visit from an expert.,"A well executed tutorial and reference to all things performance. The books takes you through all of the elements of performance in a J2EE system. Starting with simple things that can get the most bang for the buck, to more complex changes to help you optimize your environment. Several good case studies present the process in a great ""show me how"" style. Well worth the money for anyone doing development in enterprise Java.The authors are evidently experienced and write in a nice confident, but not overly technical, manner. They don't make any assumptions about the readers skill level in Java or web servers. Each step is explained well from the reasoning for the change to the finished product. They do an especially good job of helping you identify improvements to your site.Highly recommended."
4,Japanese Hip Hop,"Great album, they also have a website @ www.finlessbrown.com . Some real next ish, with the live band, japanese singing and rapping."
2,A pretty average collection of 80s 'safe' hard-pop/soft rock,"For the record, I didn't enjoy this CD much. All the songs featured are genuine hits, but notwithstanding their chart success, this is a pretty average collection of 80s 'safe' hard-pop/soft rock. Only a few of the tracks grabbed my attention: ""Rock This Town"" by the Stray Cats (the first 45rpm I ever bought!), ""Keep On Lovin' You"" (REO Speedwagon) and Crowded House's, ""Don't Dream It's Over"" (which was a bigger hit when re-released in the 90s). The rest, unfortunately, are quite forgettable. This album is reasonably priced, and worth getting if you want to discover the 80s. But Amazon *does* sell better compilations than this.....Jon."
2,Know what you're buying!,"I didn't hate it because i needed the product. I would not recommend it to anyone that needs a good clear picture. The film was not even in a package, but just loose, out of the holder, rolling around in the box. I was told, at the photo center, it was old film. Too bad for me i had already paid almost $20.00 for one roll of film. Never again!"
3,Not equivalent to my old Vanguard,I bought this heater to replace a VanGuard that I had purchased about 20 years ago. This heater doesn't heat as well as the old one. It also makes a sound that attracts your attention to it. You never knew the old one was there unless you looked at it. It is okay but I am somewhat disappointed.
5,nice knife,"The USMC ka bar is really nice, it is one of my favorite fixed blade knives out there. Ka Bar is a great manufacturer, and the quality of most of their knives is great. The USMC fighting knife, is awesome, the blade quality is great, and I love the cylyndrical hand grip. However If you plan on going hunting with this knife don't as the blade with is far to large to skin an animal with. Overall its a fantastic fixed blade."
5,Amazing Knife,"I bought this more as a toy for myself than a serious tool. It came, and still is razor sharp, holds a great edge."
5,great knife,My boyfriend ordered this because it qas cheaper thN the store. He loves it! Shipped quicky and exactly what he expected
5,Fantastic knife!,"First of all, this is a fantastic knife all around, of course it's built great and is incredibly badass. It came out of the box sharp as a razor.The only drawback I have is with the handle. When putting the knife into the sheath, it scrapes into the leather because one part of the handle isn't flush with the guard. This does not bother me however because I will most likely upgrade my sheath to a kydex-material sheath."
3,Bleak bangers,Strenuous though satisfying dark soundscapes are integrated well and work just as fine apart but the industrialized minimalism can become gratingly vacant when pushed passed its limits.
2,Fell apart,"I really did like this bracelet. It was easy to adjust but after I wore it a few times, the leather straps fell out of the ties. I haven't tried to fix it yet, not sure how to make that work nicely. I really liked how it looked, but couldn't give it more than 2 stars because it fell apart too easily."
5,Wonderful,This is the first book in a series of 3. I have read all of them and thoroughly enjoyed them. Lorraine Heath makes you fall in love with her characters. She does not create a typical hero. In Texas Destiny you can not help falling in love with Houston and Dallas. This book gives the foundation to the next two books. You can not help wanting to know what happens to everyone. I felt so good reading this. I guarantee you will not be disappointed if you purchase this book.
5,The best book I have ever read!!!!!,"I read all types of books, and hands down, this is hands down, the best book I have ever read. Sweet and tender...love beyond words in this book. I cant put it into words how much I enjoyed this book. Everyone needs to read it at least twice, and its still unforgettable."
4,You will love this book,I love this book and this author. I know you will love to read it too. Let everyone know about this book.
4,Loved it,"Loved it. THis book was so well written. I love their relationship, i loved the tender sweet way he loved Amelia. I loved her spunk and strength. Great book. Great story."
4,Entertaining Romance,"I picked this up based on an All About Romance editors list of her all time favorite reads. I like the mail order bride genre and this one had a Beauty and the Beast feel to it. It was interesting that the author didn't demonize the groom at the expense of the eventual love interest. Her intended was actually a handsome, decent guy but her affections led her elsewhere. I thought that too much time was spent with our hero lamenting his disfigurement and guilt as to how he got it, but other than that, a good clean romance novel with a spunky heroine and a HEA."
4,Heartwarming,"This is a touching, heartwarming love story that is also a lesson in courage. Amelia Carson is a true hero in that she looked beyond the surface of Houston Leigh and saw his heart, even when he couldn't. I think she was incredibly brave and resilient to seek a new life for herself.I highly recommend this book and will continue the series."
5,Another much loved favorite,This wonderful book has it all! Houston and Amelia are unforgetable characters. Their story will stay with me for a long time.
5,"Tender, touching Texas love story",Texas Destiny is a very touching story about two people drawn together during the aftermath of the Civil War. Their love story proves that love is not always where you expect it to be and those who think they are unworthy of love tend to be wrong.
5,A must,"One of the most compelling books I've ever read. Impossible to put down. During the reading, your heart melts - unless you're made of stone."
1,Don't Bother,"I really did like ""The Best Little Girl in the World"", Levenkron's prequel to ""Kessa"". But I cannot even finish this novel. It is SO boring! All the flipping back and forth between the past and present has really lost my interest. Steven Levenkron should stick to treating anorexics and stop writing novels."
5,want to read it,"I have read The Best Little Girl In The World and I couldn't put it down. I want to read Kessa, but I have not been able to get a copy of it. If anyone has any information about how to get this book, PLEASE e-mail me: baum32@hotmail.com"
3,Decent but not the best,"This book is OK, but I didnt really find it all that informative. Its a good book for those in really bad shape. It essentially focuses on cardiovascular activity, which is essential. However, if you want cardio AND size gains, buy a pull up bar and the Marine Fitness Book."
2,Not the best book out there!,"Save your money, just do pushups, pullups, situps, and run or swim. You may enjoy the sections on the history of the Seals but over all the book was just the above mentioned exercises with workouts that changed the order of the exercises around on different days. I'm 50 years old and the workouts were not very tough at all.Sorry to be negative on this review, but there just wasn't much to the book that you probably weren't already doing if you included body weight exercises into your normal workout regime."
2,Good book but the workout was really easy,The book had correct workout techniques demonstrated but lacked stamina and any sort of endurance training. I preferred the SAS workout book which I found slightly more challenging.
3,Should have bought a dvd,"Great work out, but its to darn hard to read the words, look at the pictures and do the stuff. Next time its a DVD"
4,Very Good Book,"This is great book to have if you want to get fit but dont have a gym or weights. There are pictures of all the excercises.The book has the Seal workouts phase 1& 2 and also phase 3 which is very tough. There is also a section about weight training if you want to add that in as well although most of these workouts centre around Pull-ups, push-ups and sit- ups and running. Nutrition is covered ,but not as well as i would like so thats why i give the book only 4 stars..but apart from that i would rate this book highly."
5,WOW!,"Not only can Danikas play guitar, he is soulful. I really enjoyed his varied musical selection and for those that like instrumental music, this is a CD must.Hope to hear more from this artist."
4,INNIT,Mos heducational book iz boring an duznt change u none.Dis one duz coz i iz los all respec for meself afta reedin dis...Check it!
2,Miscast lead but interesting story,"Jackie Cooper directed this 1982 biopic based on Rosemary Clooney's first memoir. It highlights her difficult upbringing and early sister act, her marriage to José Ferrer, her drug addiction and nervous breakdown, and her successful comeback. Star Sondra Locke lip-syncs many lovely songs but unfortunately she's all wrong for the part. She's too thin, her eyes are too prominent, and she's shrill and hysterical and over-the-top most of the time. A young and unrecognizable Tony Orlando is a little better as the worldly womanizer Ferrer but he never quite captures the man's arrogance or charisma. Katherine Helmond is good as Rosemary's enigmatic mother and Kevin McCarthy plays the psychiatrist who treats Rosemary after her breakdown.The movie isn't great and looks cheap and rushed, but it is a good companion piece to Rosemary's autobiographies if you're a fan. She led a remarkably dramatic life, full of emotional highs and lows, and lived to find happiness again."
4,Knights and horses,"our 8 year old grandson is enamored with Knights, castles and horses, and all of the pagaentry of that time in history."
5,Brings tears to my eyes....,A collaboration between Atom Heart and Tetsu Inoue. One of the finest ambient albums I've ever heard (up there with Eno)... deeply emotional and never unsubtle. I am always at ease and immersed in thought when listening to it. Deep Chair is worth the price of admission alone.
5,Incredible,This music (?) is way ahead of its time. Spaced-out surreal ambience makes you feel like you're on another planet. And you thought techno couldnt be relaxing...
1,did now like returning it tomaorw,didnt hold a chge lasted 30 minutes have had lots a probs with it it should be like cell phone pack you put the battery when you open it this are all 100% garbage cos they sit on shelfs i would keep if the store or black and decker will reimberce me but odds are they dont so expect to buy a battery if you want to buy this
2,Disappointing product,"With the advertized 4AH battery, I was hoping to power some of my low-mid power (15W to 40W) lights and tools. The B&D worked fine for the first few recharges (I was able to get 1-2 hours runtime) but then dropped to 20-30 minutes. I have the same problem with their 20W power supply. I am giving up on NiMH-based batteries and planning to try the Xantrex/Duracell with the Li-ion batteries."
2,Does not work well on laptops,I purchased the laptop power to go and expected the 9 hours of extended battery life on my laptop. Unfortunately the product is not able to power laptops for that long...or even close. It will give you an extra half hour of laptop battery life. That's it. I am returning this product tomorrow. The product works well for smaller electronics like cell phones and ipods but NOT laptops. Do not expect the world from this product.
1,It does not work!,"It appears to charge itself, but it will only charge another device for about 5 minutes before dying. I need to return it. Do not recommend."
1,Failes too easily,"I really enjoyed this battery pack when I first bought it, enough to buy a 2nd one. A year later, neither one holds a charge. Very disappointing."
1,Clearly Malfunctioning!!,"This item is clearly malfunctioning. I did not read all the comments, and should have. My 1 star is because this seller should know this is a faulty item. Black & Decker have openly admitted that this item is faulty and they no longer support it. I am currently in talks with Amazon to have this item pulled from the site. Buyer beware!"
1,Obsolete and unsupported,"I received my new unit, 100W capacity, and after charging it for 3-days, it could not hold a charge. I followed the instructions to contact the company before trying to return it and foul]nd out that Black & Decker customer support identified it was the batteries with in the unit. They had no spare batteries classifies this product as obsolete and therefore will not pursue supporting it. I am returning it for a refund. WHAT A WASTE of MY TIME!"
4,Not too shabby,"As others have noted, this isn't necessarily meant to power your laptop. It can, if it doesn't drain more than 100 watts (80 watts continuous). I get an extra 45 - 60 mins out of it on my laptop. It is, however, great for charging cell phones, mp3 players, etc. I already have a smaller model that I use for that purpose. I'm actually using this thing to power an aerator in a bucket of water, to keep the fishing bait alive. Works all day without a problem. My father was complaining about only getting an electric, non-battery powered aerator, and I suggested we try this B&D; battery. Works like a charm!In a nutshell, this can be used with a laptop in a pinch. It works much better with lower drain devices, however. If you battery just died, and you need to get a document off of it ASAP, this little device may save the day. Need an extra 4+ hours of battery life on your laptop? This probably is NOT for you. Get a spare laptop battery that is made for your computer."
4,Battery Pack,Nice product - Very useful for powering USB Based charging devices while traveling. Also for powering 110 V AC Devices. But not for longer charging time for Laptop.
2,Okay for $15,"Bought mine at a clearance price of $15 and now I know why. The battery doesn't last very long. I am only able to pull 60 mins at 90% power out of it. I was expecting maybe 2 hrs. I'll probably keep it in the car for emergencys. For $15 its worth it. Otherwise, your better off buying a higher capacity laptop battery.Black and decker should have estimated run times on the packaging. Pretty heavy battery to lug around."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!,"I am a professional wedding DJ, and I purchased this product in order to power my wireless speakers and mixer for outdoor weddings. When it arrived at 3 p.m. on a Tuesday, I immediately plugged it in, as the instructions advised that the item would require a long charge period.The next day, at around 10 a.m., I unplugged the unit and tried it out on my transmitter. The power supply blinked on for a half a second, then went out. Thinking that it perhaps needed a little more time on the charger, I plugged it back in, whereupon it started over from an empty charge.I called B&D; and spoke with Duane in their customer service department, who advised me that they had discontinued this product some time ago due to similar problems. If you get one of these faulty units, there is no customer support available from the manufacturer. I'm currently awaiting a refund through Amazon for this and another faulty product."
1,"OK, but overrated. Be careful.","Once fully charged (does take nearly a day) it will power a portable DVD player for 2 hours. Player and screen rated use of 27W - well below what product manual states the device can handle (80 W continuous or 100 W for 5 minutes) - disappointed in run time. Have not tried my laptop, but do not expect it to work for long, if at all."
1,Black & Decker CPI100B 100 Watt Power To Go Cordless AC/USB Power Supply,I ordered this earlier this year. I was hoping to use it when I went on a cruise to Alaska. After I got the product I charged the product. Later when I went to use it before going on the cruise it would power anything. I went to charge it again and the meter just just show charging with the progress not improving. The seller attempted to work with Black and Decker but they sold it to another vendor who no longer provides repair support. I ended up after a month getting my money back but in the long run I never got what I needed for my use.Stay away from this product. I might be a repaired product that you might not get your money because they say it is used.
1,"So far, zilch!!",I had great hopes for this unit but I've had it on a charger for 72 hours and it isn't charged up yet------nor do I think it's going to charge by now.
3,Doesn't live up to its billing,"Amazon, the packaging, and the Black and Decker website all three lead one to believe that this is designed for powering laptops. The Amazon site can be fairly interpreted to imply that it will power a laptop for 9 hours. Of course this is nonsense that anyone understanding the meaning of 4000mAh will spot immediately. Unfortunately many have been mislead. I knew that I wouldn't get nine hours but I'm not getting anywhere near 4000mAh out of mine either. It works well and is handy but the battery power useable for 120V is closer to 2000mAh. I can't reliably watch an entire DVD on a portable DVD player (no internal battery). The batteries in the pack loose their charge just sitting in storage at a very fast rate. You want to be sure you leave it plugged in until the last possible minute.For those looking to power their laptop, you'd be better looking to get one of the $250 to $400 lithium based battery packs that is shaped like a laptop. That's what I'm doing now."
3,Good DVD ... But ...,"This is a good DVD with very good children's songs. Between every song, however, there is an annoying promo for the company that did the DVD. This tends to make my toddler lose interest and we can't make it to the end of the DVD. If you're planning to use it in the car, note that it does not have the auto start feature and has to be started manually."
2,"would be good, but...","This is not a bad DVD, in and of itself. The songs are fun, familiar nursery sing-a-longs, sung by children's voices, with sweet little videos for each song. The deal breaker is that the company puts its logo and product jingle between EVERY SINGLE SONG! I assume that these were probably recorded as filler for kids programing, possibly between full length shows, and so they are tagged by the producer. But come on, what an incredibly lazy editing job, to not remove those tags when you compile all of them into one disk. Not only is it completely maddening to the parent, but I feel like they are insidiously imprinting their brand into my child's brain by non-stop repetition! For Pete's sake! Hire an editor!"
4,Wonderful DVD for little Kids,I ordered this DVD for my son and he loves listening to these nursery rhymes. This is a great buy for little kids in the house.
1,NOT recommended,"This DVD is old , like over 20 years since it was recorded, sound is lousy.After every song you get to spend 5-10sec' looking at the company logo and hear the advertising.Waste of moneyI don't think that a baby DVD should have any advertising what's educational about it ??my 18MO. didn't like it."
2,Some bad singing...,"This DVD doesn't seem to be professionally done. For the video part of this DVD they just used videos of kids playing at various playgrounds and in some studio set ups, which is OK if your child likes to watch other kids playing, but otherwise there is almost nothing going on to catch a child's attention. The bad part for me though is singing itself. It's like a chainsaw on my ears! The voices are so out of tune! I understand that the creators of this DVD used just real kids to sing the songs, but I wish they'd hired professional children's choir for this production. The logo ad between the songs seems unnecessary but not as annoying as singing itself. I wouldn't use this DVD for musical education for kids."
2,Too Much Promo,The Baby Boost promo between songs is just annoying to say the least. Stopped watching it after the first time. I should sell it on Amazon.
1,Don't waste your money,DVD has product commercial every other song and most of the songs are not the complete original songs but are shortened or modified versions also the video is repetitious in that the same scenes are used over for multiple songs.
2,Good but bad promo timing,"The songs are awesome, but there is a promo for the DVD company between every two songs. My one year old loves the songs, but quickly loses interest during the promos"
5,My daughter is in a daze when this is on!,"It may sound crazy, but since my daughter was 2 months old she has loved these nursery rhymes. I think she likes the music in combination with all of the kids playing. It's such a simple movie, I just wish I would have thought of making it LOL! I found this first on Comcast On Demand but after a while they narrowed them down to 2 nursery rhymes that were 9 min each. Needless to say, I became sooo tired of hearing the same ones, though my daughter never did. So I decided to purchase some dvds. I just turn this on when she is being a grump and she is completely healed LOL!"
2,Disappointing at best,"I bought this for my 17-month-old twin niece and nephew in hopes it might be a nice departure from the Baby Einstein that they are enthralled with. They know many of the nursery rhyme songs from daycare and sing them often. I'm so glad I watched this video before I gave it to them. I'm not sure what is worse, the incredibly annoying and disruptive advertisement for the video producers between EVERY song or the bad reverb on each singer making them sound painfully flat and unpracticed.The only things I can say to its credit is that the locations used were very interesting and the lyrics of the songs sung were the most traditional I've found to date.If this was originally made for the children involved in the production as maybe a school project to have as a keepsakeand not intended for wide-release, I could excuse the basement production value. I'm glad to have only paid $3 at my local grocery store for this video. It was a very disappointing watch."
3,mixed feelings,"child probably needs to be older to enjoy this, like say at least 3 or maybe even 5. the songs themselves are well sung. a lot of effort was taken to choreograph the videos accompanying the songs. the most annoying things about this dvd are: 1.there is an ad and the same ad with the brand or i guess producer of the video and the words ""baby boost"" said and written on screen between EACH song. when you have this many songs and you do that between each one it is more than ridiculous. it is highly annoying. also, 2.there are way too many quickly shown images/scenes for each song--it is hard even for a weary parent to follow without a bit of a headache. three stars only cause the songs are well sung and dvd viewed 1 song at a time is ok."
5,Great for toddlers,"I got this DVD a few months ago and it was the first one to ever get my daughter's attention. She is not a big fan of TV, but she adores this DVD. She sings (as much as she can using baby language!) and dances to the songs, clapping her hands and stomping her feet. Some featured kids cannot carry a tune, but she doesn't seem to mind at all. She absolutely loves this DVD. It is a great buy for toddlers."
