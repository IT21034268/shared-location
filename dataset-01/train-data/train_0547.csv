3,Much more fun than its reputation suggests,"Evolution is a lot more fun that its busted summer would-be blockbuster status implies, although like most Ivan Reitman comedies the concept is funnier than the script. For the first half David Duchovny and Orlando Jones have more exposition than jokes to deal with and Julianne Moore is game but is no natural comedienne, especially when it comes to pratfalls, while Ted Levine's clich√©d general is a villain too far. But once it hits its stride and the constantly evolving critters that are the real stars of the show start multiplying and threatening mankind with extinction, it's an enjoyable monster mash that even manages to make a joke of its product placement for Head and Shoulders. Like the aliens it's no world-beater, but it's a brisk and enjoyable romp. Nice score from John Powell too.DreamWorks DVD has a good selection of extras, including audio commentary, deleted scenes and alternate ending."
4,fun for everyone,"My boys, 12 and 15, loved this movie. So did I. It has comedy, suspense, action and romance. Very entertaining. Sean William Scott is always good for laughs."
4,evolution rvw,Loved this one when I first saw it. Good mix of sci-fi with good humor.Good turn around on delivery after the order.
3,It Was Alright,"Anything with David Duchovny is worth the time watching :). Sadly, I ended up LOSING my time with this flick. The storyline was fun to watch because it gave a lighter side about aliens and outerspace other than the series X-Files usually protrays (which happens to be my all time favorite series). The only thing that bugged me was the sexual innuendos. I can handle movies that have that and violence, but I can only handle so much! Had it not been that way, I would have considered giving this movie 4 stars instead of the 3."
5,Great Spoof!,"This movie was a hysterical, comical spoof of many different movies, TV shows (including X-Files), & even some commercials. Duchovny fans looking for an X-Files-type flick will be very disappointed, as well as those expecting a drama. Those of us who waited to see what it was with an open mind were rolling in the aisles or on the living room floor."
4,Very Funny Disaster,"This is your typicle Ivan Reitman movie, make a disaster movie that is hilarious. David Duchovny and Orlando Jones are Junior College Prophesors that make an unbelieveable discovery. No matter what they to do to keep it a secret it still leaks out to the government. When the government gets involved so does Julianne Moore, Who is a total babe, Julianne is both a genius and a cluts, which makes for a perfect charater in this movie. Every actor in the movie is hilarious and a perfect fit. If you like sci-fi with a dash of humor, or visa-versa, then you will love this movie."
5,fabulous entertaining movie,this is the best movie i have seen from a long time.The comedy is sensible and hilarous . It is better then big daddy and scary movie.i would say all the persons above 8 years of age should see this.
2,Barely Watchable,"Being a fan of David Duchovny of X-Files fame, I was looking forward to this movie after seeing the previews. I missed it at the box office but I couldn't imagine that it was not funny so I went ahead and ordered in on DVD. I thought, hey I bet this will be another ""Ghostbusters"". BIG MISTAKE! This movie sucks. I struggled through watching it. It was rarely anywhere near funny and the attrocious story and acting made it one to add to the list of worse movies. I immediately donated my copy to the library. I figure maybe someone can check it out if they have insomnia. If it doesn't put you to sleep I don't know what will."
2,Not the greatest movie ever... but okay,"This movie has one of the most outrageous plots I have ever seen. It is also full of about (by my count), 300 movie cliches. I went to see the movie hoping for a good laugh (at least I got one or two of those) and my money's worth (did not get this)."
5,Would give 10 stars if I could.............,"My family and I LOVE this movie. We love the evolving, the enema and every part of the movie. The 2 dumb acting students save the world, the guy gets the girl etc. etc. I caught this on one night and couldn't wait to buy it. I bought it the next day!!! I don't see THAT much of a similarity to ghostbusters!!! I think anyone who doesn't enjoy this needs to lighten up--and just enjoy it. People are too serious!!! This is a great comedy and I am recommending it to everyone I talk to!!! Thanks Ivan for another GREAT one!!!!!!"
3,Evolution,"Funny how Duchovny leaves X-Files and yet finds himself surrounded by aliens. Guess the man can't get away from Mulder. Just thought I'd share that thought with you. Especially since I don't want to give too much away.The cast of this movie works well together. Especially Duchovny and Jones. They just seem like they've been best friends forever.Anyway, this is a stupid movie. It's supposed to be. It is entertainingly stupid. It isn't meant to be serious or elegantly funny. It is meant to be campy, and it achieves this effect.So, if you aren't into stupid, campy movies, you probably want to stay away from this one. If you love stupid, campy movies, this may be one you want to check it."
1,Can I give less than 1 star??,What else can I saw? I wasted 2 hours of my life watching this asinine drivel.Avoid at all costs!
2,Who ya gonna call? Not these guys!,"What do you get when you have Ivan Reitman directing, Dan Aykroyd starring, and the plot being about three guys trying to stop strange occurences and the end of the world?If you thought of GHOSTBUSTERS, you aren't the 1st.EVOLUTION is a poor-man's version of GHOSTBUSTERS. It has everything that GHOSTBUSTERS had (neat special effects; a large cast; Ivan Reitman) except for the humor. Without Bill Murray around, GHOSTBUSTERS probably would not have worked as well, and this 'film' is proof of that...Duchovny should have stayed with the X-Files a bit longer, so that someone else could have been cast as his character. He didn't deserve this movie...The special effects are neat, but they are there only for the *WOW* factor, and that is where it fails, too. The effects aren't all that great...Oh well, as long as GHOSTBUSTERS is still around, we'll be fine..."
4,"The Less Talented Cousin of ""Ghostbusters""","It's hard not like this movie. It really is. Ivan Reitman returns with the formula oringinally conceived by Dan Aykroyd for ""Ghostbusters."" While some things in this film are pretty ridiculous like destroying the aliens with Heads and Shoulders because there's a certain chemical in it. Still, the movie has many funny spots and the performances are very good. David Duchovny finally gets to do something besides the X-Files and the movie is panned by critics and then bombs at the box office. What a shame. The creature designs and special effects are very cool too. Yes this isn't as good as ""Ghostbusters"" but it's definitely worth a look."
1,Not even worth renting,"This sci-fi comedy is neither funny nor intelligent and I'm a fan of David Duchovny's and science fiction. None of the characters seem well-developed or interesting. The film lacks the impact of a true farce, the bite of sarcasm, or the entertainment of witty dialog. Only the most juvenile viewer would enjoy this movie. Evolution offers nothing new. The best thing about the film is the variety of quickly evolving aliens. I was actually rooting for them. A civilization that creates movies like this almost deserves to be wiped out."
4,Great light hearted entertainment,"This is a highly entertaining movie with little substance. The cast is fun (although David Duchovny is certainly stiff in a comedic role), the story is amusing and the production qualities are high. The story by no means has any profundity to it, but its amusing and entertaining overall. Highly recommended."
2,Charles Darwin is rolling over...,"This movie is plagued by lame dialogue, bad acting, ill-advised physical comedy and more. There are a couple of laughs at the end (I won't spoil it for people who still feel the need to see this) -- and Sean William ""Stiffler"" Scott is always good in his stoner persona, but this was still a disappointment. Julianne Moore is hopeless as the clutzy government scientist. I was also shocked by the really inferior video quality of this DVD. The film had an ever-present dull, grainy appearance. At least a nice transfer would have made this fiasco a little more watchable. A rental at best."
4,Have a nice end of the world!,"I have seen this movie twice since it opened! I thought it was much funnier than Men In Black, and much more intelligent as well. The special effects were great, the creatures good to look at and were integrated into the film so that you could not see the difference. As always, I found David Duchovny's acting to be very well done. He does surprisingly well in a comedy-delievering both straight and downright hilarious lines with skill. Orlando Jones is my new favorite funny man. I have not seen him in very much, but I was impressed by his comedic timing. Julianne Moore was at her best, radiant and a very good ""straight woman"". Seann William Scott was a delightful surprise as the slightly confused, but good hearted Wayne. And Dan Aykroyd was a nice addition, with his small part as the governor."
3,Great Googa-Mooga,"Don't be fooled. The box on the DVD lists ""A Conversation with Ivan Reitman, David Duchovny, Orlando Jones, and Sean William Scott."" This is actualy a commentary track. It is at times very funny. All of the guys are together in a room having a blast watching the movie. Ivan Reitman plays the teacher trying to keep his students in line, when all they want to do is play. The Deleted Scenes are pretty good. The Sarah Silverman scene and the alternate ending are the two best.As for the movie, it trys to hard to be Ghostbusters. At times it succeeds and at other times it falls flat on its face. The mall and the extraction of the bug from Jones are the two best scenes, but the courtroom scene just didn't have the punch of the EPA shutting down the Ghostbuster's containment unit. All in all this is a movie that after watching you will not feel you have wasted your time seeing."
5,LOVE IT,This movie was worth the 5 times I went and saw it. I just went to see it because of DD but then I realized that it is a wonderful movie!! I just love it. It's the next GhostBusters! It will be worth every penny that I am going to have to pay to get it now and I will pay it. I love it. Highly recommended for all people young or old. My grandma laughed so hard she cried my mom laughed my 5 year old sister came with me all 5 times she liked it so much. BUY IT TODAY!!!
5,GHOSTBUSTERS MEETS MEN IN BLACK and a whole lot funnier,"this movie is AWSOME! this movie is about a meteor hitting earth with alien organisms in it. Ira Kane(David Duchovny), Harry Block(Orlando Jones).Dr. Reed(Julianne Moore) Wayne Grey(Sean William Scott) come together to investigate they discover that they start mutating into bigger, meaner aliens. The downside of this movie is that it comes out on video in Ireland and the UK November 26 and in the United States on December 26 which is the day after Christmas.DDDDDAAAAARRRRRNNNNNNIIIIIITTTTTTT!!!!!!!!!!!Well when it comes out on video in December I will be the first one to buy it."
3,Evolution,"I am heartened by David Duchovny's several attempts at comedy (AKA: Playing God). He is a very funny guy. As for this move? It is certainly not as good as something like Ghostbusters, but very funny in its own right. The movie makes very few attempts at taking itself seriously, so the comedy may be low-brow and predictable, but is still quite funny in places.Some of the lines are very clever, like Duchovny saying: ""You just have to know how to talk to the white man...he don't like to be yelled at."" That killed me.As long as you don't expect comedic genius, this is a very funny movie - and worth seeing with a crowd of your friends."
3,Eh,"This is one of these movies that had the potential to be something more. But when defeating the alien involves a huge puerile and dirty joke, it simply can not reach that level."
4,Short but could be shorter,Good summary of the issues. His method that he found effective could be summed up in two lines. Use both Lamisil and Penlac. Keep using Lamisil in the following months for an additional 10 days each month. Interesting read nonetheless.
2,Not a documentary. Just readings from the book.,"I thought it would be a documentary, but it was just people reading quotes in front of an audience. Interesting stuff but hard to watch the whole thing. Guess I should have taken the title of the DVD a little more literally! Lol. THAT birthday gift was a flop! :("
2,Doesn't work,"I agree with one of the other reviewers...you have to wipe and wipe, and it STILL doesn't remove all the makeup! I guess I'll have to try a more ""oily"" one."
5,Very Best of Country Comfort,"I love this music! I grew up in Waimanalo and used to listen to this music all the time. I actually knew Billy & Jimmy. I love the sound and feel of this band. It reminds me of when I was young and walking home from school slurping on a shave ice, or sitting at the beach and watching the swells come in. I'm really sorry this band can no longer play together. It is a real treat to hear ""Waimanalo Blues"" or ""Hello Waimanalo"" while sitting at my desk at work in California. It makes me homesick! If you want a taste of real Hawaii, try this CD. It's ""da kine""! I also recommend Gabby Pahinui and Sunday Manoa."
4,A nice (erotic) preview of time travel paradoxes,"Up the line deals with its protagonist Jud who lives in a future society where time travel (only into the past ) is permitted via a newly discovered Bencheley effect :)He joins up in the ""time courier"" service who are essentially time tour guides and starts taking groups of tourists for visits to Medieval Byzantium.In the process we discover numerous paradoxes of time travel including meting several instances of yourself at the visited spot every time you go back to it.Eventually he falls for his distant ancestor Pulcheria and celebrates an erotic encounter only to lose it all to some tourist in his group that causes a massive time foul up.Overall an excellent read with several sexual encounters to add spice. Intelligent accounts of some time travel paradoxes are visited although the resolution of these paradoxes is fairly weak.Overall an excellent read for a rainy day or a long flight."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"What do you do if you can travel through time on tours? Have lots of sex, it appears, and fun. Of course, this sort of monkey business needs overseeing to stop all sorts of paradoxical happenings.There are agents that do this sort of work, but they are not all immune to temptation. This is what happens here."
2,up the line,"I would not recommend this book unless you are 12-14 yrs. old. There are to many repeats of family trees,people from 21st. cent. back through time that only ware cloths that reveal their figure if clothed at all. And of course everyone from 12 up through the centures has sex -sex and much more sex. Sleep with your grand parents no problem it gets BORING after the first few pages. I gave it a 2 star because of the time travel other wise a 1 is to good for the book. Oh I forgot to mention the only thing time treavelers want to see is battles -death and hacking up people. Again BORING. So if you are 12-14 get it you will love it otherwise save your $ Just finished the book and the ending ,though converluted ,wasn't to bad . Still get it from the library if you must read it and save your $."
2,POOR SOUND,"It's been labled a Bootleg at Sound Unwound and so it is. A poorly recorded Live semi-fusion effort. Stan, with Bob Brookmeyer, Andy Laverne. The sixth member of the sextet is a noisey conga player whose efforts are totally useless and counter productive."
3,Solid textbook on a growing subject,"Advances in deposition technology has facilitated the increasing use of hard ceramic coatings based on borides, carbides, and nitrides. This trend has been accompanied by an increasing literature on the subject. This book is an attempt to synthesise some of this literature together into a standard book by taking articles authored by different groups, and collating them into the appropriate sections. Each individual article is useful and the level of the text is appropriate for even undergraduate engineering students. But the text as a whole does not flow well, and there is too much emphasis on nitrides, specifically boron nitride. A better balance could have and should have been achieved, especially given the amount of literature on the various carbides such as SiC, TiC, WC, FeC, etc..."
5,Great follow up!!,"Joshua Kadison makes a great showing in his follow up album. Moving away from the sticky-sweet pop sound of songs like ""Jessie"" and ""Beautiful in my Eyes,"" Delilah Blue is a mature album... and frankly it is nice for an artist to show that he has depth. If you enjoyed Kadison's 1st album only for its chart hits, this is not the album for you. But if you thought Painted Desert Serenade was an all around pleaser-- Joshua will not let you down on this follow-up."
4,real life joy & sorrow in music,"josua kadison has a powerful talent!! His music touches a place in every heart and soul that few people have the guts to show to he world, yet he does just that with style,grace,& a seeming lack of hype. I peronally hope to hear more from Mr. Kadison in the very near future. His music revives my soul!!!"
2,I agree......what the heck happened,"Joshua, great first album and down hill from there. I haven't heard the Imported album but if it is anything like Delilah, then I must pass."
4,Loads of fun!,"I bought this as a birthday present for my boyfriend (he's 24) and he swears it's the best present he's ever gotten! It provides endless amounts of entertainment and can even make you break a sweat! Love the fold away feature so it doesn't take up the whole living room! The only reason for the 4 star rating was that the hoop started coming apart & it would be a little more challenging if it could be mounted higher.. but other than that, it's definitely worth the price!"
1,Basket broke of rim due to poor weld after 3 shots,We ordered this for a christmas gift for our 8 year old son. After just 3 shots the basket disconnected from the rim due to a poor weld -- the joint between the basket and the plate that connects the basket to the backboard was completely rusted. We are trying to contact the manufacturer.
4,Good Value,Good product especially for the price. Mounts easily. Well made. The electronic sensor is accurate.
2,Great at first but didnt last very long for the cost,I bought this back in 2006 for out basement game room. I loved it. It looked great on the wall and took up such little space when it was put away. I was so happy there was an alternative to the bigger indoor basketball games. Our family played it for about 3 months and the scoring stopped working. My husband is pretty handy but he could not get it to work and the customer service was not helpful. I still thought we would play with it without the scoring. Then the leg that supports it cracked so the game became unsteady. Last the hoop cracked. I do not think we overused it or abused it. It was mostly played by adults or with adult supervision. I was disappointed for the amount of money I spent that it did not last very long. I would love another one like this but I won't chance spending so much money espcially with no usuable warantee.
4,Great Product,"I've had this now for over a month and absolutely love it. Was worried about some of the other comments -as far as the rim breaking however, havent had any issues. Maybe they have reinforced it or something since those reviews. Anyways, fun to play -and looks good too. Kids love it and we play all the time...even my 2yo loves it. I would recommend getting nerf or softer balls if you have a little one playing...I lost a few glasses from the balls bouncing around..haha."
2,"At first glance, nice...but just wait","The idea is great! An arcade type, indoor basketball hoop game. I love the compactness too butwe were disappointed in the quality. The screws holding up the net easily popped out and otherscrews are popping out (from when the ball hits the backboard). The storage net which states will holdthe basketballs when not in use can in no way store even one ball (deflated, yes but who's goingto do that?) We just put it together for xmas and after an hour we had screws popping out.I don't think this will last for very long. I think I will buy things like this from local storeswhere I can return if dissatisfied.I would not recommend this product! I'm sure there are better quality ones out there (most likelymore expensive too but you get what you pay for - although $149 isn't cheap too!)"
1,The Norton Anthology - American Literature,"Only sent one volume of a 2 volume set. Trying to return is as if I had done something wrong. I had to buy the books from another source so I paid twice. Shipping was slow (I receive product ordered from China the same day before I received the book) Great, but costly, learning experience"
5,loved these book,needed these for college. I really enjoyed reading these books. got a good source of history from them. really enjoyed. down side is not worth anything buy back
2,Good book but...,"This is a great book. I'm in my third year of college in my third week and we use this in my History of American Literature class, so we're learning about all of the Pilgrim era authors, whether it's parts from their journeys in The New World, or poems they've written. The only thing that I don't like, is that I only got Volume A, and not Volume B. Yes, I got a refund, but I'm going to have to buy Volume B soon enough for the second half of the class, so that will cost me even more money."
1,check the edition,"The books arrived in a timely manner, however I purchased the 7th edition and received the 6th edition. While I was not happy with this and it has greatly increased my study time, I did not have time to send them back. I paid five times as much as I would have for the 6th edition (finding it for just $10 on amazon). I did not even realize I had the wrong edition until I started questioning why all my assigned readings were on the wrong pages, to late to return it. The books were in good condition I would just recommend checking the edition as soon as you receive them."
3,False Advertising?,When I enlarged the picture of the books that were advertised (ie. the book sleeve) It was a different edition than I received. The edition that was advertised was the seventh and the edition that I received was the sixth. This would be fine if the edition that I received actually had all of the readings in it that I needed. BUT it doesn't!My advice would be to double check editions with the seller before a purchase because maybe they don't know what they are selling.
1,New packaging = New taste,"I have been using Jay Robb vanilla for years because even though it was expensive, it was the best tasting protein powder on the market so it was worth it...that is until they went to the new packaging. For whatever reason they seem to have decided that they needed to change the forumla as well. The powder is now more ""waxy"" and the taste has really fallen off. I am very disappointed that they would do this to such a great product. If you buy this based upon the many glowing recommendations of how great it tastes, only to be let down you'll know why."
5,Jay Robb,Jay Robb vanilla whey protein is the best tasting vanilla whey protein available -- and I have tried many. The product was delivered quickly. I'm very satisfied.
5,protein powder,"Just what I expected. Makes a good protein shake by adding frozen fruit, a little water and some ice cubes. Fills you up and hopefully I will lose a little weight at the same time."
4,So good!,"Just got mine yesterday and I must say that it met my expectations. The best protein powder that I have tasted so far. It mixes really well with pretty much everything. Unsweetened chocolate almond milk, unsweetened vanilla almond milk, coconut water, frozen blueberries, frozen strawberries, bananas...."
3,Not a fan,I have tried countless protein powders over the years and I have to say this one just tastes bad to me. I dont know what it is but I can barely drink it. Going back to Designer Whey- sweetened with stevia-much cheaper- tastes better.
2,It might be good for me but.....,"I was excited to try the vanilla flavor after reading all the positive reviews, but unfortunately, was not impressed. It leaves a very unpleasant aftertaste. Maybe the other flavors taste better. As another reviewer noted, it does not mix particularly well with just a spoon (mixes fine in a blender). I give the product two stars because it does not contain any unnatural additives...."
2,natural but not tasty,I was really excited about getting whey protein with stevia in instead of artificial sweeter. It had a soapy taste to it. It did not taste like whey protein at all.
4,Great product,This is a great protein source. It is very easy to mix and drink. I would recommend this for anyone that needs a protein supplement.
5,Great!,"Tastes great, mixes well ( I use a shaker cup) and doesn't have that chalky after taste. I add to my Shakeology to up the protein."
4,Great Product poor packaging,The new bag type packaging is very poor and difficult to reseal. The whey powder gets into the seal causing the seal not to be made. Please offer the original bottles as an selectable option.
3,Nice and simple. Understated is the goal,This watch is well done. Simple and easy. Beautiful and understated. Perhaps a little too pricey for what it is. Your clearly buying a name and nothing more.Needs to be part of the solar cell game to rationalize the cost.
3,"Nice Product, somewhat broken","Very nice product, ideal for my purposes if it hadn't broken.After a few weeks of use, something broke so that not all of the heating coils engage when on low heat, thus the air is fairly cool. High heat seems to work fine still. It's a pity, but otherwise good."
3,My Review,"As you know I like to give positive reviews at the same time, I am a consumer as are you, and we want to have the best information to make the best desicion for our purchase. I found the Conair Ceramic, 1875 Watt Compact Turbo, Hair Dryer to be a much superior hair blower for a similar price. This one makes a very high pitch and extremely loud noise when its on high, not for me."
5,Very impressed,These thinning/pruning shears are of very high quality and precision made. Very comfortable to use and should last a life time...
5,Love these pruners,I have 6 pair scattered all around. I love them. They are especially good for a woman to use; but then the reason I have trouble finding them is because my husband keeps swiping them.
2,GIANT Chair,"This chair is rally not practical. It sits very high in the air, way outside of the water. It is difficult to get onto and difficult to stay on. It is just way too large and uncomfortable. I purchased three, opened one and will get rid of the other two. Bad, Bad, Chair!"
5,Great for me and better for my grandchild.,Great book! I had an earlier version when I was just learning chess and somehow I gave it away or lost it. I ordered one for my grandson and will order others as the rest of my grandchildren get older and show an interest in learning chess.
5,Grupo Niche's BEST ALBUM!!!,"This is the cream of the crop of Niche's Albums. From the title cut to Las Tres son Caribe and Colombia Tierra de todos, Salsa didn't get any better in the 90's. Great singing, excellent arranging and the songwriting was superb. For dancing to or kicking back with the headphones and just groovin'. This is the shnizzle...!"
1,One of the great shows on TV...,"THis is one of the great TV shows of the past. This show is worth watching. It is Not like the trash that is on now. Bring on all (7) seasons. I want them all.I love my DVD's. And it will not be long before I can kiss the Cable TV GOOOOOOD BUY!I will have all I need on DVD. And can get it from Block Buster are Net Flix...Be well all.UP DATE..... 5/04/10 Well I go to get Marcus Welby M.D. Today, only to find it does NOT Have Closed Caption. Are SDH... So it is no good for millions of us that are hard of hearing.One more flop from S.F. ... Sorry but true...."
5,Marcus Welby M.D. 1969-76 Is A Wonderful TV Show,"It stars Robert Young, one of the best all-time actors. The story lines were sensitive and compassionate. The writing on this show was excellent. The series was broadcast in color. All of these add up to a very great TV show. What more do we need to know, except to say PLEASE RELEASE SEASON ONE now! I'll be the first one to buy it. Thanks!!!!!!!!!!"
5,One of the best medical shows ever,I feel that Dr. Welby was before his time.This was cutting edge drama.This was a well thought out show.
5,$4,"The BEST ten episodes from the first season.Two DVDs.Over eight hours!Stars Robert Young and James Brolin.FOUR dollars!In your basket yet?I mean --- really --- do you want/need every,single, episode? Sometimes a TASTE is enough!///////////////////////////////////////////////////////Another bargain --[$3.33]-- to look at:Blossom: 10 Very Special Episodes (TV Flashbacks)///////////////////////////////////////////////////////"
3,So-so Strider,"This is the reproduction of the original one, evidently. Not Toybiz's best. The joints on mine are rather loose - the left hand came off at a mere touch, though I got it back on - and somehow the neck just doesn't look right. Accessories are nice, his bedroll and bow in two sling-over-shoulder pieces, but it's tricky to get them both on his back so that his cloak can fit on over them. Face sculpting is a bit odd, the eyes painted strangely and somehow he just looks sort of unpleasant and sour. Details are good, but face is definitely odd."
5,Great stuff,"This book is the first one I read on Norse Mythology. I picked it up at a second hand book shop and thought it would be a good starting point. It was! This book covers a lot of stories concerning the Norse Gods and some of the heroes. It starts at he creation of the world and ends with its destruction. The saga of the Volsungs takes up a great part of it. I must add that I appreciate the fact that Barbara used the Norse names for the heroes, not a modernized version.The book is easy to read, very informative and it captures the sad, slightly bleak, heroic and battle hungry essence of Norse mythology. I would recommend this book for any beginner in Norse mythology but I'm sure any other fans will also enjoy it."
2,"I was really excited to get this, but...","I was very excited to get his book in the mail, after reading the Starseed Transmissions. Both are very poetic, and make you feel all warm and fuzzy inside. However, there were a couple things that gave me pause. First of all, this book was written in the 1980's and it seems to indicate that the whole world should be enlightened by now. Clearly that is not the case. What really got me though, was the ""narrator"" stating that he was Jesus of Nazareth, a person for whom there is no authentic historical record other than the bible, which is a religious text of Christian mythology. Sorry...great writer, but I think I'll stick to reading books by people who don't make such ridiculous claims. Had he written as himself, I believe this book would be much better received."
3,Good Message,"This is a good message, written with passion and love but, to me, it is much too judgmental to have been written by anyone other than a fully conscious Ken Carey.Unlike the message in the book, God's love is all encompassing and if (or when) there is a transformation of consciousness, there will not be anyone left behind to experience any private hells.God can be found through personal experience but he/she can also be found through reason, by the intellectual as well as the uneducated, by those with arms outstretched and those with hands held tightly to their chest.There are no limits to the ways God can be found. No angel of God could have written this book. Though it is beautifully poetic and reaches for the stars, its authentic source seems to be right here on earth."
2,hang on,"This chair was not our first pool chair but, it was our most unstable. It will flip you in a second. Quality of construction and color were good. I gave it away to a younger more slim person. It just needs a design change."
1,Worst thing I have ever purchased,I do not believe Amazon would have such a poor item in there inventory. I purchase from Amazon feeling safe that they know what products they represent But from now on I'm not sure if I will ever want to purchase from internet. If you can manage to get into this chair don't breath because it will flip The design doesn't accommodate a human I don't know how they can sell them Since sending it back (Which cost me $32.50 shipping and I still not sure if I will get the rest of my credit) I have found others who have the same complaint. I feel Amazon should check this out. Evidently the company knows this is a defective item but continues to sell it
5,What a shear pleasure reading this book,"I was given this book by the author, as a Christmas present. What a wonderful and light-hearted book. Signed by the author, I couldn't wait to buy 1/2 dozen copies and ship to my friends. This book is a must if you want to bring out your inner child and smile all day long!"
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"This self-published tiny book can be read in about 30 minutes, after which the reader has learned nothing new about the reasons for the sad economic state of classical music in the United States. Also, the writing style is dull, pedantic andpreachy. If you really want to understand the symphony orchestra problems that currently exist I'd suggest the books by Horowitz, Morgenstern, or Lebrecht. This offering pales in the light of those."
2,My Godfather III of Books,"After seeing Flambards on TV a few years ago, I immediately read the trilogy and found it very enjoyable. When I heard a fourth book to Flambards was out, I made a trip to the library and settled down to what I thought would be a great read. But it wasn't. I was very disappointed in Flambards Divided. Not to give away the plot, but let's say I wasn't at all pleased in whom Peyton decided Christina's choice of who was right for her after all. That's when I decided, that just like Godfather III, Flambards Divided never ""happened"" and have happily left the characters in my mind where they were at the end of the trilogy."
5,Essential Reading!!,"This book is the long awaited sequel to the Flambards Trilogy, written some 12 years earlier. It continues the story of Christina Russell and her return to the old house Flambards. She is about to marry Dick, onetime stable boy, her husband Will having been killed in WW1. But trouble appears in the shape of Mark, Will's brother and old adversary of Dick - and one-time rightful heir to Flambards. Christina finds herself being pulled towards her feelings for Mark and in conflict with her new husband. This book perfectly rounds off the Flambards series, and Peyton has been faithful to her original characters. A delight to read - again - and again and again."
4,Watch the Mini Series for the Trilogy - then Read This One.,"If you want to believe that Cinderella lived happily-ever-after(despite having only met her prince once, at a party) perhaps you shouldn't read Flambards Divided. But for me, this is the best read of the four Flambards novels. This is the one book where the narrative is character-driven, rather than the mad gallop through the story of the first three books. Flambards came alive best,though, through the fabulous mini-series of the late 70's. So give yourself a treat and watch that - then read this book, and find out what happened after the ballroom lights were put out......."
5,C&K Great Songs & Price Lets You Buy More,This CD of 16 (yes 16) C&K old time favorites and some previously unheard songs is now a must in my car to keep me in good spirits during those Seattle traffic jams. Really enjoy the long renditions and some background accompaniments. I received the CD in excellent condition within 10 days.
1,Junk,I bought this for my 5 yr old grandson. He wasn't able to use it because the spining gear would not engage. He was able to hold the can and quirt the string and use the water squirter seperately but the thing would not work as advertised. The thing is cheap China plastic and not worth buying.
1,Not worth it!!!,This is junk and a major rip off. The commercials entice the kids but it hardly worked -- replacing the web fluid is a fortune and even if you do replace the canisters.. they run out of fluid very quickly.Don't waste your good money.
1,do not buy,this is the worst toy ever....the web string sticks to everything and stains fabric. i was expecting it to be like silly string but it was very wet and sticky. makes a total mess(even outside)!!!
3,Not as adorable as she looks,"This baby doll looks so cute....but the arms were attached incorrectly, the legs look really funny with the baby doll's clothes off (every little girl wants to change her baby doll)and when you take off her headband, her head shape seems a little off...kinda small. Also - I thought for the price, that she would come displayed in a pretty box; instead, she was just laying in a shipping box. I even ordered a second doll, thinking I might have gotten a doll that had been returned, but the second came the same way. I bought this for my 3 year old granddaughter and she plays with it, but - all in all - it was pretty disappointing."
4,Hours of fun!,My 5 year old loves to pretend and this has kept him entertained for hours. It seems fairly durable but he hasn't had it that long.
5,The Beatles,"Love this group! A lot of great music comes from the British.These guys are a great addition to my vinyls as well as CD""s."
5,Everything I needed to Know about the World,"This book makes you want to know more about the world, by showing detailed maps as well as pictures and short essays that descibe the regions. The stuff on Russia is really good beacuse I didn't know much about the geography of the country. It makes me want to go travelling round the world (although the atlas is probably a little too big to take with me). Great book."
2,Ho-hum.,"Good, thorough information but due to size constraints the map plates were crammed and cluttered. Difficult to extract data from maps. Edutainment style Software readily displaces this book with easy to use, point and click technology. Bulky, hard to use, disappointing graphics. Ho-hum."
4,Classic Ultravox,"The first album that I got on vinyl of Ultravox that still sounds as good now as it did then.Ah the days of the new romance movement with keyboards,electronic drums and guitars pumping out rocking beats.Yep this album has all that and a couple of quite moments just to bring you down a notch before getting you upand started again.Bonus disc is great as you get Live + studio songs that one might not have heard.Good clean Remaster, but what's with the packaging? yet again a let down. Why have song titles and a couple of pictures?Hmm maybe they should have looked at how other classic's like the 1st album or Ha,Ha,Ha,Systems of Romance were Reissued,now that's what I call packaging. But still get yourself a copy and play it loud."
4,Don't beleive the critics,"After rediscovering this album just recently, I have found the music on it to be a collection of fantasy and sci fi. Sure, they tend to be very mechanistic with their drum beats, but if you listen the words you will see that the variety and depth of their music exists greatly in what they are trying to say. Plus, they have some fun while they are at it."
5,A masterpiece of world literature,"""The Cyberiad"" is not ""science fiction"" any more than is ""Gulliver's Travels"" - with which it should be justly compared. These ""simple"" little fables discourse wittily upon Love, Art, Death - all of the grandest themes of literature - with a subtlety and wisdom that never fail to move me, no matter how many times I read it.Lem's book has the surest mark of a masterpiece: it is a work that deepens in meaning as the reader returns to it at advancing ages."
1,Cyberetarded,"I fully agree with reviewer Michael J. Laramee's renaming of this as ""The Cyberetard."" Lem is my favorite author, but I quit reading this after the 3rd story. Maybe the humor is simply untranslatable into English, but a bright grade schooler could have written this. The 1st 3 stories were just...stories. Dull stories with no deeper meaning and not even a punch line. I don't get it. And anyone who compares this to Hitchhiker's Guide is a Vogon of particularly low IQ even for a Vogon.You know what it reminds me of? Unpublished stories written by famous authors before they were famous, slapped together by a publishing company in order to make a quick buck (or in this case, zloty). See, e.g., I. Asimov's ""Buy Jupiter.""Ya know, not ONE of the reviewers who thought this was deep or just funny was able to explain one example of a scene that was deep or funny. I challenge you to do so!"
2,Am I the only person who hated this book?,"I'm baffled. How could anyone consider this a brilliant book? Lem is a hopelessly overblown and self-conscious writer. He takes potentially compelling ideas and ruthlessly grinds the life out of them in page after page of look-at-me I'm-so-clever prose. He's like a bad comedian who won't quit after the first chuckle: ""Maybe you'll laugh harder if I say the same thing six or seven times, getting sillier as I go."" Lem compounds his crimes with garish moralizing, often dripping with condescension: ""Hee hee! They so dumb, we so smart, me give them funny names like Stupidicus von Logarithm then tell logarithm jokes for 17 pages.""Despite the insufferable writing, Lem's ideas are often quite good, nudging the book into the two-star category. One wonders how the book would have turned out in the hands of an author with imagination, wit, *and* writing skills: Arthur C. Clarke, Kurt Vonnegut, or (with a few plot adjustments) Franz Kafka."
1,This should be renamed: The Cyberetard.,"I actually managed to wade through several of the ""stories"" in this book before I gave up.For the most part, books should be enjoyable to read.This one by Lem (like many others) requires a lot of work on the readers part to sort though the jumble of non-sense words.I've never done drugs; however, I believe you have to in order to read one of his books.I understood all the words he used - I guess he just didn't put them in the right order; because it sure was tiresome to read...Better than His Masters Voice - Not by much though."
4,"""Fables for the cybernetic age""","The Cyberiad is more than just ""a brilliantly funny collection of stories for the next age,"" as the back cover claims. The tales within blend philosophy, mathematics, and computer science with cruel kings, pugnacious pirates, and improbable dragons. They chronicle the exploits of the robots Trurl and Klapaucius, renowned constructors who offer their services to the robot kings that rule the robot kingdoms comprising their universe. So great is their knowledge of the universe that they build a royal advisor that never errs, a perfect mechanical poet, a machine that can model anything in existence, and a machine that can fabricate anything beginning with the letter 'n'. Of course, their creations don't always work out quite the way they hope, but in edifying and entertaining ways. This combination of fanciful adventure and academia, often laced with delightfully clever wordplay, makes the Cyberiad well worth reading."
2,BUYER BEWARE there are several shades for this one color,This polish has a pink tone. The one I usually get with my pedicure has a natural tone. There was no way I could tell the difference online. Both are called Sweet Heart.
2,CIPA 11900 Ford Custom Pair Towing Mirrors,"The towing mirrors installed nicely and stayed on the entire round-trip of 2,400 miles pulling a trailer. However, the mirrors vibrated so badly that they became useless at highway speeds. They were difficult to adjust since the mirrors interfered with their surrounding plastic frames and would not stay adjusted during the trip. Also, the mirrors were too small for practical use. The product would have been much better if a stationary convex mirror had been used."
3,good for price,These mirrors are good for the price and fit very well on my 2001f250. The only thing that I don't like is at highway speeds the mirrors have alot of shaking that does make it hard to see but it is easily fixed with a hot glue gun to help eliminate the vibration of the mirror.
3,DIY,PROMPT DELIVERY VIA UPS.FITS OVER THE 2005 F-250 SUPER DUTY 2D CAB. DISAPPOINTED WITH FORD FOR INSTALLING MIRRORS THAT CAME WITH THE TRUCK AND IT HAS FACTORY INSTALLED TOW PACKAGE.I FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO ADJUST THE PASSENGER SIDE MIRROR IF YOU ARE ALONE. FORD'S POOR DESIGNED MIRRORS ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE PROBLEM!
5,great toy,My son loves this toy. The pieces are very sturdy and easy to use. Great toy for hours of fun.
4,Can keep them entertained for a while,"Caveat when considering this toy: it does take some time to put together. I'm rating the durability at three because we just bought it a few days ago and haven't really put it through the paces yet. It feels sturdy enough so long as it's not used as a stepping stool. You will need to get the action figures and it also begs to be joined by the other toys in this series. My son, who is 3, is very entertained by this toy, even more so when we play with him. There are videos based on these toys which I'm considering buying to help him ""get it"" even more. Another caveat: my son was a bit surprised by the images (volcano errupting, tsunami, etc.) on the screen, but it's certainly because he's rarely exposed to such things and these were new concepts for him."
2,"Don't spend your money on this, but the figures or vehicles","My son played 2 yrs with all his figures..he is now 5. We had the original command center and thought the aquatic one might be a blast. The original one had a great elevator and he played with the voice recorder for hours. The new one, he did not give the time of day. The elevator was a joke and a platform would not stay on. It took up half of my dining room which I would have happily sacrificed if only he actually played with the toy. I said good bye to it last night as we donated it to a daycare in the area. My son did not even mind to see it go. (And we know how kids hate to part with toys)"
3,Not worth the money.,Although this may be a pretty solid toy with a couple of neat features our 4-year old son does not play with it very often. ... it is so big he cannot move it around easily. He plays more with the RH fire truck with the water cannon....
5,A must have,"I just bought this toy for my 5 year old sone who thinks he is a Rescue Hero. The afternnon we brought it home, he played with it until I made him stop long enough to eat dinner. He loves it! I wish I would have bought it sooner. I agree that the elevator could have been made alittle better, but I am not woried about my son breaking it either. My husband & I pretend we are on rescur mission with him. It interacts great with his other Rescue Hero vehicles and men. I would recomend this toy to anyone! Thank you Fisher Price!"
2,"Great Step Stool, but horrible toy!","I bought two of these last year, One for a gift & one for my 6 year old son who is addicted to Rescue Heroes...we have almost everything that has been made in the RH line. I am a big fan of the Fisher Price RH, they are very durable and fun. However, this Aqua Center was truly a disappointment as others have said, it is really big and bulky. My son played with it for a few days but quickly lost his interest in it. My son does use it for a step stool and my daughter who is 7 likes to dance on it like a stage and she does have tea parties (using it for a table), I will say, it is very well made and durable but really a boring toy. Your child would have a lot more fun playing with all the men, their motorcycles, cars, firetrucks, helicopters, etc. I would not recommend this unless you need a really large stool plus this toy is WAY over priced."
4,Great toy but,"This is a great toy, but my almost 4 year old son hasn't got into playing with it as much as I would like. He has a lot of the rescue hero action figures and four of the vehicles and I think he may be a little overwhelmed. However when someone plays with him he loves it. There are big plastic card like things you put in to change what mission the rescue heros are on. His favorite mission is the earthquake. He likes to rescue ""people"" in his toy cars. Also the talking action figures can change what mission they're on to coordinate with the command center. The toy took about an hour to put together, and since this was a birthday gift, next time I would probably assemble it ahead of time."
4,Read the Box,"Okay, we were tortured for weeks before Christmas for this toy for our four year old son. He loves it. But beware, make sure you read the box (which we did not do). This Center comes with no action figures and the only place it says it is the very bottom of the back of the box (which we noticed as we tossed the box away starting assembly). After almost an hour of putting it together and my son seeing the figures on the picture in the front, he was very disappointed, as were we, that the figures (or atleast one) was not in the box. Being Christmas Day, there isn't a store around that is open, so he will suffer for today. But, he did go and get some of his other figures and they played on the Center most of the day. I was pleased with the size and durablity of the product for the price. Nice toy for the little guys (and gals) :)"
2,A Shelf Not Worth the Buck,"My 5 yr.old step-son loves Rescue Heroes and was thrilled when he rec'd the aqua command center. His ""thrill"" was soon diminished and the aqua command center all to soon became a resting place for his action figures. When asked why he doesn't play with the command center, he says it doesn't do anything. I paid too much money for a Rescue Heroes shelf."
3,"Big, Bulky, & Pricey",I am normally a big Rescue Heroes' fan but was very disappointed by this one. The toy is HUGE! It takes up a 4th of my sons' small floor space and they hardly ever play with it. About the only thing they like is the music it plays. Of course that means we have to listen to it over and over and over...I'm just glad I wasn't the one who shelled out the cash for this thing. My son saved up his birthday money to purchase it. I think he learned a bit of discernment from this one.
4,"Fun, but a pain to put together!","My son has been wanting this playset since he got his first figure and saw the videos. I must say I was as excited to play with it as he was. I was a bit disappointed that the figures don't say more things when hooked up to the back pack. I thought they would say other phrases than what they normally say with their own backpack. It was also sort of a pain to put together. You had to align the tabs just so or it wouldn't pop together. Seems to me, that is a problem with most Fisher Price toys you have to assemble. It always seems like the plastic is cheap and flimsy. Once I assembled this toy though, it did seem sturdy enough.Also,there were about thirty stickers I had to apply myself. My son is three and very happy with the toy and plays with it constantly. We did have to rearrange his room a bit to accommodate it."
2,tupperware mini shaker,"the lid does not close tightly, so use a sealed baggie if you use it for liquids or dressings like I did, so it doesn`t spill everywhere."
5,An Excellent Roadmap to Enlightenment,"This easy to read, warm, insightful work is an excellent handbook for anyone seeking to find the way to enlightenment. Those who are just beginning to explore the deeper meaning of life, will find Fast Food For The Soul a delicable morsel to consume. It's lessons will help the neophyte by illuminating the path with the simple, powerful, yet practical methods for human evolvement.I've been studying metaphysics for over 30 years and I found this book a delight to read. Ms.Burgers refreshing presentation of very complicated issues helped me find easier ways to engage others in powerful conversations. Fast Food's approach puts the LIGHT IN ENLIGHTENMENT. I highly recommend it!"
2,"I don't own these anymore,","(See my review on Felco #2 pruners as to why.) After reading the current reviews on these things, I have to say I'm a little suprised by one (bending cutting 3/8 inch branches... ouch, I don't think that is typical.) I can see these working well for cutting sunflowers... if that was all these were used for I could see giving them a higher rating, but most people will use them for more tasks than that. I bought a set on the advice of a salesman and took them home to try out for a couple of days, and took them back. They're all right, but I think you are further ahead by spending the extra ten bucks on a set of Felco's. Better quality, better feel, better durability. You'll be happier longer."
1,Don't use them on big cuts... they'll self destruct.,"On the first day out, these pruners self-destructed on me. I used them to trim some small branches. They worked fine through several, but then apparently twisted on one cut. The large blade gouged into the small, digging into the metal. I didn't have any warning or ""feel"" that the blade was twisting and the branch wasn't that thick (1/4-3/8""). I had to take them apart and file away the very large burr. Needless to say, they don't work as well now and I'm in the market for a replacement."
4,book,informative. I got this book after my husband had a minni stroke and it was very informative. I will use it often
5,Size,The box indicates it fits a shortbed. Double check the part numbers to ensure thats what you need.
4,Great product!,Will save your interior if you tend to carry liquids in the back of your SUV. I would highly recommend this liner for people with kids or people who work out of their SUV.
2,no es el mejor....,"Se acababa de separar de Willie Colon, a mediados de los ochenta, y todavia no la pegaba muy bien solo. Trae las siguientes canciones: Amor pa que, Ya no te puedo querer, Siembra (version bolero), Mucho mejor, El Corrido del Caballo Blanco, Usted, NoeA la verdad que solo los tracks 1, 2, 4 y 7 valen la pena...especialmente el Noe, que cancion mas graciosa. Las demas son bastante olvidables. Los coleccionistas querran tenerlo solo para tener la coleccion completa, pero si estas empezando con Rubencito, compra Siembra."
4,Affordable Option,"Decided on this product after we tried 110 lb paper that couldn't fit through our copier and jammed. This paper is a little lighter than what you would think of as card stock, but it does the job and doesn't jam. Holds toner great and looks like inkjet would work well too. Bright and vibrant as well as cost-affordable."
2,too light for my purpose of making greeting cards,"a nice finish and does print out well, but thought it would be heavier for greeting card use. think it would be nice for printing photos, if you don't have photo paper"
4,A perfect bedtime routine begins here...,"My three children have been listening to Barney's Sleepytime songs for YEARS. It is now in the hands of our youngest child, who will be 2 this summer. It is the ONLY cassette she will listen to at bedtime, and it is our second (wore out the first copy)...we're now investing in the CD version! Side One is perfect to play while your child takes his/her bath, brushes teeth, etc. It is a little more ""uptempo"" than the second side of the tape (or second half of the CD, whatever the case may be). The second half is VERY soothing... sometimes WE fall asleep as we rock the baby and sing along to the ""nighty-night"" songs. I'd recommend this to ANYONE in need of a new routine at bedtime, for ages birth-5 years. :)"
3,Cute Book.... Light Read,"After being classified as a ""road warrior"", I received this book as a gift. I wouldn't have bought this book on my own.I found this book interesting learning how many different types of road warriors there are out there! Some I would never have thought of!I would really recommend this book to anyone who loves to be on the road or loves to travel and they don't know where to get a job... or even what type of job they want. It's an excellent book for that type of person. Great starting point.The only reason I give this book 3 stars (instead of more) is because the book didn't relate to me since I'm already a road warrior."
2,old?,I LOVE Mat and the things he covers and the way he does it is GREAT! But...I wonder how old this DVD is because the recording quality is really pretty bad. I expect Mat ought to do it over with updated technology. At the very least it should be made clear to people purcasing this Disc that it is a copy of an older tape if that's the case.
2,False Description,"This does NOT have ""Hickory"" wood handles. They are made of ""Ash"" wood which are not as strong. I contacted seller to inform them and their position was that the item's UPC code matched item they sent to me so they think all went well, What? I'd stay away from this deal. Poor all around."
3,Jesus' discipleship explained,"This book was an excellent introduction to Discipleship. The chapters are broken down logically, and the writing is easy to understand. We often think of Jesus speaking to large groups of people and transforming the lives of multitudes. The truth is that Jesus spent most of his time preparing the 12 disciples to change the world. In the end, Jesus followers only numbered 500. It was the disciples whom Jesus prepared who took his message to the multitudes and changed the world as we know it.Coleman explains how Jesus discipled the 12, and used many examples from the Bible which was useful. However, for some reason even this short easy read of a book started to lose my interest towards the end. Maybe it says more about than the book, but I had to press myself through the last 20 pages."
2,not about sharing your faith,This book is not really about evangelism and how to personally share your faith. It is more about Jesus' method of raising up 12 disciples to carry the message after he had gone.
4,Pleased,"I was pleased with the way you handled my order. The price was good, merchandise was available and I received it promptly. Thanks"
4,A true blessing and classic,"This book focus on evangelism but mostly on discipleship! If you have always had questions reguarding how to share your faith and help someone grow in their faith, this book would be a help to you. It is simple yet bold as Coleman is passionate about serving the Lord in a non-tradionalist, religion way. Thanks."
4,Evangelism is an interesting subject...,"It can keep you in a good discussion for hours, with friends or strangers. I give this book 4 stars because it tied in well with other course material but wasn't an end all be all. I'd recommend it if you are interested in becoming better at sharing the Gospel."
4,Fundamentals,This book is a great all encompassing look into Jesus heart for evangelism. Who better to learn from than the Master Himself
1,"Spritiual imperialism, etc...","I first read this book attending a School of Evangelism, and thought it was a great book. At the time I didn't know how to read."
5,Simple yet Lifechanging,"This book changed my outlook on life in just a few hours. It is about Jesus' life and method of reaching out to people. In our day and age many think that conversion is enough, but Jesus made it clear that discipleship is vital. Coleman continually points back to the Bible, referencing the way Jesus lived his life as a model for believers today. This book is amazing. you should read it!"
5,classic evangelism at its best,Please note that the book I received was an abridged version and this was not specified when I ordered it.This book was for a required 1st year bible class and I was very inspired by it. It was written in the 1960's and is considered a classic. It presents the original plan of Jesus to save the world and how it is done. Totally at odds with what churches try to do on a massive scale.What I most enjoyed was the presentation of Jesus' day to day life and the gentle way He taught His disciples.
2,Big Disappointment,"I suspect that the other reviewer, the one who gave 5 stars, works for Corona. There is no way these things can cut 11/2"". I used them to cut branches of 1"" or less on shrubs and decorative evergreens. Cutting was laborious. I thought the handles were going to break! They did not cut cleanly either. At the end of the cut a small piece of the branch slips between the two cutting blades and the whle thing jams up. I am returning this tool. You might be satisfied with this product if you want to cut very small branches, etc because they are light-wieght."
2,Corona Clipper SL-3310 Bypass Lopper,"This product is a not as advertised, all the packaging says ""Made in USA"" but the clipper says ""Taiwan"" in small letters on the blade."
2,Blade broke,"Not too long after I bought these loppers the blade cracked on a 3/4 inch shrub and then later broke. I am going to call Corona and see what they offer as far as a replacement. Granted they weren't that expensive, but the blade to break was not something I expected. I would not recommend these for any kind of use. If Corona does right by me I will post a follow up. Let's see if they stand behind their products."
2,Not up to Corona's standard,I have two other Corona loppers that are high quality and have served me for years. After purchasing these loppers I did notice they were not as easy to cut small branches as my other loppers. Today after cutting back green bush branches about 1/2 inch in diameter the rubber bumper broke completely off the shears. The rubber is held in place with a die cast metal part that I predict will fail on every one of these shears. Other Corona loppers and hand shears are great but stay clear of this engineering flop.
3,Hafid - The Sea,"Hafid released in the U.S.A. as ""The Sea"" was an interesting movie. It's about a very disfunctional family with each person keeping their own lies. It took me a day or two after watching it to really think about everything, however since it's in Icelandic with English subtitles that may be the reason for it."
3,Environmental and moral issues in this film set in Iceland,"This is an independent film which is set in Iceland even though it was filmed in Canada. It's the story of an aging fishing industry tycoon who is being pressured by his family to sell his factory. There are environmental and moral issues here because if he sells to a big corporation, the people in the town will lose their jobs, fish will be caught in tremendous batches and half of them will be wasted. His three grown children, however, want him to sell. The whole family hates each other and there is cruelty and anger in every word they speak. Soon, secrets begin to be unveiled. The conclusion is sad but expected.The acting is excellent, the directing good and the photography captured the cold and isolation of the place. The whole film is a bit depressing, however, and even though it held my interest throughout, I just couldn't feel sympathy for any of the characters. Film buffs might like it but there are better films around."
1,"Avoid The ""Movies""","The two ""movies"" are just really BADLY spliced together episodes from the series. While this has been done before with TV shows like ""The Master"" or ""The Gemini Man"", this is a whole new level of atrocious. What makes it so bad is that they spliced in completely random fight sequences from other episodes, or even from ones that they already used. For instance GH & Kato will be fighting some bad guys in a hotel room, then suddenly Kato is alone in a warehouse they fought some othe bad guys in just a half hour ago in a different episode, then its a jump cut back to the current episode. This is so god-awful it would be funny if you didn't have to pony up actual money for it."
2,shiny new package for 1940-1976 material,"The new graphics using the logo of the 2011 film made me hope this was finally an authorized/ improved copy of the '60s TV series, not a compilation of old home-VHS quality recordings. It isn't. Professional-looking though the packaging is, the TV episodes have cable network logos at the end and some are dark.The 1974 and 76 ""films"" -- as mentioned by other reviewers -- were always patchwork compilations from the TV episodes, released for the benefit of Bruce Lee fans.The 1940 Universal serial is the 4th disc, a reasonable copy, but not as sharp as the VCI releases.The fancy packaging includes an email address for ""crescentmediaco"" -- a free gmail account -- but no copyright claim or address."
2,rpdoff,"Having just looked at one of the four discs so far, the overall quality is suspect. Looks like all of the episodes were copied from a TV adventure channel. One episode in particular is so ""muddy"" that it is just about impossible to watch. The cover art etc. is obviously copied from photographs and certainly not from the actual company that would have published and copyrighted this collection in the first place. Very disappointing!"
1,Not an official licensed item!,"Keep in mind that the TV show episodes are not an official release from 20th century Fox and that no actors, musicians or production personnel have received the proper compensation for their work. This is in essence a bootleg item!"
1,Obvious bootleg,"The menu is home-made. The end credits have ""What's Next on the Action Network?"" at the bottom of the screen, and the whole thing is way too dark. Obviously a ripoff from a TV."
3,green hornet,"the green hornet tv series was great to watch. the only thing i was switching back and forth from batman to the green hornet when it was on tv at the same time. the tv series only had 28 episodes if you count the 2 batman cross over. i bought the vhs tapes of the 2 serials of the green hornet just in case they didn't put on dvd yet, the finally did. i had great results transferring the tapes over to dvd. i hope the new green hornet movie does well, if it comes out."
1,Do Not PURCHASE !,Do Not Purchase my Friend and I were taken as well ! There not Honest a totall waste of time and Money .
5,Bruce Lee Classic,"Video quality is surprising good on the 1960s episodes with Bruce Lee. The1940s serials leaves a bit to be desired, but come on, everyone is buyingthis set for Bruce Lee, and the serials are 70 years old! There's a lot ofspecial features and additional content in this set. I paid $30. For themoney, its a great deal."
5,BRUCE LEE IS BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"In ""Fury of the Dragon"", Britt Ried alias The Green Hornet (Van Williams) is a masked crime fighter (almost like a superhero). His butler and sidekick, Kato (Bruce Lee) is a kung fu maniac who you don't want to mess with. 1976, Dr William Beudine."
1,BAD BOOTLEG!!! NOT THE COVER PICTURED ADVERTISED,BEWARE THIS DVD IS A RIP OFF!!! RECORDED OFF TV> BUT IF YOUR HARD UP LIKE ME YOU WON'T CARE I PRAY THAT SOMEDAY FOX WILL SELL A OFFICIAL DVDGreen Hornet 4-DVD Ultimate Collection Digipak
1,Caveat Emptor,"I knew I was in trouble when I received my copy of this title today and the return address was for England. When I popped the DVD into my drive, a message came back immediately saying in essence that I was in the wrong region for running this DVD. I am going to try it on my DVD ROM drive in my computer, but I have no idea that that will work either. All in all, this has been a disappointing day as far as this item is concerned. I would advise people not to buy it or at least be careful concerning the person selling the item. Even though the Amazon ad says that the disc will play in all regions, that isn't necessarily true. In the meantime, we will have to wait until an American distributor decides to bring either the Green Hornet movies or, even better, the TV series to the market. Let us hope.A Disappointed Customer"
4,I would highly recommend this product,"I prefer the larger size .. I ordered these by mistake .. but if you are just clipping flowers, they would be great. The larger size is more versatile"
3,Not really bonsai clippers,"I bought these for my husband who'd lost his pair a few years back. They're ""okay"" but not traditional bonsai clippers. They're more designed for shearing flowers."
2,These clippers are very small,"Ok, so they *are* called ""Mini Shears"", but beware they are VERY small. They will literally fit in the palm of your hand, and are only about 4 inches long. Don't purchase these if you have serious pruning to do."
3,smart but not real muppets,this is a exellent way to get your kids to learn to read. I have had this video since I was young and I must warn any one who wants to get this video that this is simply taped pictures out of a book. The characters do not move and are not even real muppets. If u r looking for muppet videos don't get this but if u r trying to get ur kids to read u should get this.
2,Not that good!,"Well, it's not that good! it dosen't have the real muppets and it's not very good anyway! So don't but it."
3,Expected an exercise video,"I thought this was going to be a step-by-step exercise video, and it was not. There are a couple of moves demonstrated, but all in all, it's a bunch of people doing a bunch of different dances. It was fun to watch and it did get my daughter dancing, but it was just different than I had expected it to be."
1,totally non-structured,"This was billed as an exercise DVD. It is not! It is a couple of demonstrated dance moves, and a very few late 70's and early 80's songs. I feel like I wasted my money."
5,FANTASTIC!,"I actually thought this would be fun for my youngest daughter who is 3, but when I put the video in, my 13, 9 and 7 year olds were glued to it as well! It is REALLY lots of fun, and FUNNY too! The dances are engaging for kids, and it keeps you humming..""Coach Coz, he's the coolest guy around..."" I am looking forward to their next release!"
3,Careful what you wish for,"I remember when this album came out and I was shopping for stereos. I was surprised to find that both of the places I was shopping had this album to use as a test. I haven't heard it since I retired the turntable, so I was really hyped up to listen to it again. First off, this doesn't appear to be remastered and the sound quality is not bad, but it just isn't great. There are a few really good songs here for Carpenter fans, but overall, it was a disappointment. I guess that I just remembered it being better."
3,"Nice,but a change of style that didn't suit The Carpenters.","The album has some nice singing but I recall when buying it back in the 1970's how disappointed I was at the change of style. I think that is why it's sales were low compared to previous albums. Still.""calling occupants""went top 10 in England and top 40 in the U.S.A. and Karen's fabulous voice is still worth a listen."
4,"Carpenters' ""Passage"" CD","I purchased this CD for just one song...'Argentina' by Karen Carpenter. Through the years, I have noticed that Karen had one of the most perfect singing voice I have ever heard in over 50 years. Oh, there were other fine voices, Patti Page, Kay Starr, and Julie Andrews, but nothing compared to Karen."
4,Passage Is A Good Album but..,"it's like there was not enough effort put into it....Sure they have a few great songs on here....but im used to the Carpenters putting out an album where I like all the songs...There are highlights throughout the album...My favorite track is ""I Just Fall In Love Again""...I am still not sure to this day why this was not a single....Other highlights include ""All You Get From Love Is A Love Song and Sweet Sweet Smile""...Both were singles charting at #35 and #44.......Another single was Calling Occupants charting at #32...a very good but strange song.Another highlights to the album are titled Man Smart,Woman Smarter and Two Sides.....The other songs I basically just skip....But make sure to pick this album up....It's a keeper"
4,Survival of the Fittest,"Although this was majorly overlooked upon its intial release, in hindsight it remains an inventive yet still familiar Carpenters album. Standout tracks are the gorgeous rendition of ""Don't Cry For Me, Aregentina"" and the slightly feminist ""Two Sides"". I have always enjoyed this album, and remember my Dad bringing it home and playing it. Now, as an aduly myself, I continue to enjoy this offering and highly recommend it for any true fan. In a wors, it's creative."
4,MIxture Of ALL!,"Only the carpenters can combine pop,opera ,a touch of country and aliens all on one cd and make it work!Karen lulls us with her interpretaion of Evita on this classic Carpenters release.She simply sounds terrific singing this great operatic extravaganza.She also adds a little country flavor to the cd with the song sweet sweet smile.The cd ends with a long song,Calling Occupants Of Interplanetary Craft.A song deemed very appropriate for modern times with the alien phenomena in full swing!!!"
4,Excellent Bag For The Money,This camera bag is smartly designed. There is plenty of room in the main compartment for a point and shoot or digital camera. I put two rolls although there's probably room for three in the expanding pouch on the front of the bag. The picture shows this part of the bag as grey. It's actually all black. On the back of the bag is a snap down strap and another compartment that can hold batteries or other small items. The carrying strap is plenty long and can easily be removed if you so choose. Overall this bag works very well and is a good value.
1,Don't waste your money,"This one is junk. It does detect metal 1/8"" deep. We buried 2 coins a 1/4"" deep in our sand box. Now I have to stop my 5 year old from screaming that we lost 2 quarters. Guess it is time to get the BIG shovel and sifter and find those quarters!"
1,I know its a toy but come on.,I know that its a toy but it could have been a bit better I mean I couldn't even pick up something only 2 inchs in the groung. Dont waste your life and money with this.
5,sani wipes,Use them every day to wipe the house and office. Very good in the kitchen and door knobs. Make sure you wear gloves and let the product dry!
1,Horrible Backgammon Set,"Backgammon is a great game.This set is almost worthless. I didn't know that anybody would bother to create such a low quality set. The pieces are tiny and slide around the board far too much. The box is shoddy. I don't require majestic backgammon sets, but when you buy a $10 chess set you get a very usable board and pieces most of the time. In the case of this gammon set, it is so bad that it means playing backgammon isn't fun.I don't know if there are other $10 sets of backgammon that are better. But I know this one is so bad that it's a waste."
4,Too good to stay on vinyl,"This is a very good album, waitin for it to be pressed onto cd with Thee Image's other & only companion album. This music deserves to be heard, if anyone is listenin, press on the 2 Thee Image albums."
2,Don't work for me...,"I purchased these on sale at Amazon, but was very disappointed with the successful burn rate. Stick to Verbatim's and you can't go wrong."
2,It is not what I wanted,"OK yes I got fujifilm DVD+R s but the fujifilm that they sent me are package differently then the image they have, for the image they have is of fujifilm that where made in Japan and the ones I received where made in Thailand yes there is a difference and I order from then hoping the product would be the some as the display image but it was not. Other then that they arrived on time."
4,Forgotten 80s gem,"Great little gem from the 80s with a great performance from Peter Weller as a scumbag loser who nearly ruins the lives of Teri Garr and her two sons. Garr, Collett and Haim all give solid support,but the film belongs to Weller. Equal parts charm and menace, his role is unapologetically sleazy. The quality of the blu-ray picture is grainy,due to the film stock used. No extras,but really worth seeing."
2,Six Sigma for Healthcare,"This book was a required read for my graduate program and I was very disappointed in its content. I don't think it equates at all to outcomes improvement, there was a lot missing in the correlation."
2,Too expensive for what you get...,"The Six Sigma folks carefully guard their secrets, wanting to enroll people into their training programs. This book, while entertaining, is slim, sparse, and personally unfulfilling. I got as much googling online as I got from this book. I had to purchase for a class at school, but recommended the school be more considerate and stop listing it as a required text."
5,Forensic Buff,"I really enjoy this book best of all on Africa.It includes everything and the pictures are terrific. If you want to read a book on Africa, I recommend this one."
5,he was hot before he was hot! but not what you think!,i was a big jerry reed fan since i was 12 or so years old! i had his greatest hitsand uptown poker club and played them til the record wore out. never stop listeningto him but i had no idea he did rockabilly and old country! this is amazing. i hadno idea he could sing like that. he sounds like all those guys back then! i guess hisamos moses and other funky rapping kinda singing was bigger for him but this is somegood stuff. if you like his guitar playing get this for his singing too!
4,Fingerpicking and Singing,"I've been a Jerry Reed fan for years. This is a very nice collection of his hits compiled on one CD. His voice sounds like when he was younger,It's a nice addition as I enjoy his style of playing guitar. This 22 song CD is from 1997 but it's always nice to hear Jerry. If you like to see him perform he also did a DVD concert with Chet Atkins at the Bottom Line. You won't be disappointed."
3,okay but not great,"I have other shoe trees that are better than this one. The ones I got at JoS A Bank are much better, just being honest..."
5,Great quality and price!,"I'm very pleased with these cedar shoe trees. Though a fairly boring item to purchase, much less rate - it's worth noting the price was very fair and the quality is very good."
5,If You Had To Buy A SECOND Transtion Book...,"...(after you buy TRANSITION MAGICIAN), then please buy this one. You get more of the same easy-to-do, but jaw-droppingly effective, techniques that will save you countless hours of classroom instruction...and might even have people shaking their heads at your ability to associate with children.Please Remember: PRACTICE these techniques until you have them down as a second nature. That's when the effectiveness of the methods really emerges."
2,Only for Mountain Bike,"This set is very large and should only be used on a mountain bike, this should have been made clear before purchase."
5,the best you'll find,"I've purchased this delightful product several times and must say that each shipment has been in perect condition and on-time. THe meat is firm, yet has all the flavor highlights of magret; the ducks have obviously been fed a diet of fine ingredients and I can only imagine how nice the foie gras must have been.If you're looking for execellent, flavorful magret, you have found it!"
5,comfortable and effective,"These sunglasses are terrific, they are great for all light levels, and weather conditions. They are especially great on cloudy days, when it's still bright out. The clarity is amazing, even without being polarized"
3,Good Book for your childs first reading,"What I expected and what I recieved were two different things. IF your son or daughter shares your enthusiasm for Firebirds this would be a great book for them to get started with. Big print and easy to read words, my 7 y.o can read it. I do not recommend this for the enthusiast though. Children yes. Gives a decent start with how Firebirds started out history wise on through todays car. Childrens book though."
4,Great for Future Missionaries!!!,"Ruth Tucker clearly tells the stories of many missionaries of the past two centuries. Her summaries are concise, and packed full of useful information to help prospective missionaries avoid mistakes. Am not sure how biased her focus on women is, but the stories are amazing nonetheless. It has been amazing to see what God has done through our brothers and sisters! Remember the persecuted!"
4,Stories of the spread of Christianity from its beginnings.,"Ruth Tucker traces the spread of Christianity from its very beginning to the present time. Rather than a dry, academic approach dealing with dates and concepts, she captures the very heart of mission by exploring the eras of Christian mission by recounting the lives and experiences of the people who defined them. Her book treats the human dimension of the mission endeavor by delving into the lives of missionaries, some well-known, some all but forgotten. In all, Tucker offers an often compelling narrative that adds drama to an otherwise unexciting topic"
4,A great overview of world missions history,"I am not a history reader by choice, but this book makes it easy to track the development of the major missional keys to the advance of the gospel from Jesus to now."
5,Missions brought to life,"From Jerusalem to Irian Jaya is a great book for anyone wanting to learn about the history of Christian missions. Tucker relates the stories of many great and/or influential missionaries from the 1st century A.D. to the present. The stories are interesting and relevant. Tucker strives to include the good, bad, and ugly as it really happened and strays from the absent-minded listing of facts and dates. I bought this book for a class I am taking for my undergraduate studies, and it is one of the best text books I own."
3,Making a Mess of Missions,"Ruth Tucker exhibits the spiritual discernment one expects in this late Laodicean Age of the church: lukewarm!I was amazed to read what Tucker considered ""missions"", especially concerning the harlot church of Rome.Better title would be: The Mess Man Makes With ReligionThis book has very little to do with real Biblical missions."
5,Bury my Heart Somewhere Near Buffy,"I see people calling the song Bury my Heart At Wounded Knee gruesome. I'f you'd ever seen what happened at wounded knee, you might think otherwise. The song is downright tame compared to what happened there. It's also fairly restrained in terms of the anger that anyone who grew up on a reservation has a right to feel.I looked for this song because of the cover of it that the Indigo Girls did, and although they did an awesome job, hearing Buffy sing it sends a shiver even deeper because of the reality of what she grew up with. Thank you Buffy."
1,IS THIS A LADY OR A WOLF HOWLING????????,Buffy Saint-Marie has an OKAY voice but most of the time it sounds like nothing. Her songs don't make any sense and they are really weird. These are them1. Darling Don't Cry2. Up Where We Belong3. Piney Wood Hills4. Cripple Creek5. God Is Alive/Magic Is Afoot6. Until It Is Time For You To Go7. Universal Soldier8. Goodnight9. Dance Me Around10. He's An Indian Cowboy In The Rodeo11. Now That The Buffalo's Gone12. Soldier Blue13. Eagle Man/Changing Woman14. Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee15. StarwalkerBury my Heart at Wounded Knee sounds kind of gory for young children and Starwalker sounds weird. He's an indian cowboy in the rodeo is KIND OF sweet but none of these lyrics really make any sense. THIS IS A WASTE OF YOUR MONEY unless of course you want to annoy your siblings. (Like me) :) But I do not like this CD at all!
1,SAVE ME!!!!!!!!!,"It is offical. Anyone can have cd. It is scary. Buffy Sainte-Marie proves that as long as you have songs, no mattter if they are good or bad, you can have a CD. Her songs sound like nothing, her indian cries sound totally made up and her lyrics make no sense. She says 'bury my heart at wouded knee' this sound gory and gross. 'starwalker' sounds like she found words and strung them together. 'Darling don't cry' sounds like an insult to Canada. 'He's an indian cowboy in the rodeo' sounds......weird. I don't even want to TALK about hte others, this is a big, fat, waste of good money."
3,Annoying,"Why couldn't the artist learn enough about owls to draw the correct number of toes?Owls have four toes. When perching, for the best grip, two toes point forward, two back. When catching prey (mostly rodents), three toes come forward."
4,A classic,Pat Hutchins has a classic in this book. It is a good book for teaching new vocabulary and bird sounds.
2,Bruner Flashes Ingenuity In A Overly Dense Form,"I read Bruner's book in one of my doctoral seminars which added a unique perspective on curriculums in early childhood education; however, journeying into the book and determining the main points of argument will challenge due to Bruner's overly dense prose.He highlights the idea of culture defining curriculum through its langauge, customs, history, and society status, but he fails to offer examples accessible to the classroom teacher.I would recognize this book as a added addition to to any Early Childhood Professional's library, but please prepare yourself for many re-reads."
4,Good tube,"I have about 400 miles on this tube and it is performing as expected, construction seems good, no complaints so far."
2,"Rebranded Kenda Tube, Faulty Valve Core","The tube, much to my surprise, is labelled the same as the old tube which came on my bike, KENDA, made in China. This is embossed near the stem, across from the stem is the Sunlite label in white. That doesn't bother me really, it's just a bit misleading, as this tube can't be too different from other tubes sold as Kenda's.However, the valve core is removable which was not advertised, and that removable core is leaking air. I imagine once I replace the core it will hold up just as well as any other tube, this is just a disappointing amount of difficulty for what is usually a simple job."
1,Not the best,"This is pretty bad... Its actually laughable. If you want to read one of Chris Hart's manga books, read Manga for the Beginner: Chibi. It's way better. Or, better yet, buy a how-to-draw manga book from someone who is a professional manga artist."
4,"A good start, but...","I was completely terrible at drawing, but I wanted to learn how to construct manga characters. This book is good for basics, a few eye shapes, head and body shapes, basic motion. There's even a bit on robots, so mostly what I expected. My only qualm, no mention of hair or clothing technique. Now, I've only had it a day, and I can spit out a generic face. Also, I can draw a much nicer circle."
3,Diane Schuur is amazing but......,"This jazz artist is phenomenal but the orchestra is on such an ego trip that they drown her out, song after song after song---shame on them! All of these horns blowing so loud and brash that you can barely hear the great Diane Schuur. On the other hand, Ms Schuur guest stars on a Ray Charles concert for the school of the blind,(also DVD) and Ray's gracious manner and his amazing orchestra steps lightly so that Ms Schuur may shine as the great singer she is! There has never been anyone like this woman since Ella FitzGerald. Wow!"
4,Good value for money,"Again, this item in the series of dvds is superb.Nobody in their right mind can complain about getting to experience great jazz performances and as a bonus, value for money."
3,Good but not great!,"I must say that I expected more out of this product. It definitely serves it purpose, don't get me wrong, but it could use more cushion on the seems. That is pretty much my only complaint. Besides that, the product is great. My mac is very secure in it. The quality is great. Just wish that it had a bit more cushion power on the seems, preferably on the bottom portion of it. Now the reason why I say this is because I ride my bicycle to campus everyday. My bike is outfitted with panniers versus me wearing a backpack to haul all my school materials. Now with that being said, I place my Mac in one of the pannier side saddles inside the MacCase. Certainly fits snug. Does the job that it is suppose to do just wish it had a bit more cushion is all."
4,PB Sleeve,The product fits the Powerbook just fine and provides protection. I wish they would add a handle to make carrying a little easier. It is rather slick and would be easy to drop.
4,My sharp Corona,The Corona is a great triple sided sharpened blade that cuts twice as fast as conventional blades. It can easily cut live or dead limbs up to 6 inches with no problem. With larger limbs be careful not to flex the blade tip with too much force or it will break. This happened to me so I replaced it by purchasing an entirely new unit which cost less than simply buying a replacement blade. The grip on the handle is ergonomic and comfortable. I highly recommend this compact pruning saw.
5,A Privilege,"When my friends ask me what we're listening too, I tell them that these are the ""outtakes"". I've always loved a good ""outtake"". They're cute and humorous and different. We've heard the Beatles songs over and over and over again for so many years. So to get to hear a different version of them is so much fun. You get to hear them mess up, or add in some commentary, or just jam and get crazy!These anthologies are a must have for a Beatles fan who knows all the original songs by heart."
5,Fascinating,"This is a great alubum I would reccomend to any serious Beatles fan. The first CD, dedicated to the White album period is really great, starting with the early Esher recordings and moving through a series of early takes, alternative versions, unreleased vartiations etc. the highlight for me must be the marvelous, clean acoustic guitar 'While My Guitar Gently Weeps'. The second CD gives us great unspectorised versions of the 'Let it Be' album songs, such as 'The Long and Winding Road', 'I Me Mine' etc. and alternative versions from Abbey Road, including a lovely simple version of 'Something'. If you've got a few Bealtes albums and like them then certainly this is a CD you should get."
2,"Edit the six down to a single disc, please.","If you put most of the never-before-released Beatles songs and a few snippets of banter from these six discs onto one disc artfully, you could get an interesting and affecting curiosity. I give this two stars, not one star--and I'm making a point to be especially generous--because George Martin's ""A Beginning"" is a very pleasant and classy piece of music and because John Lennon's (rather tedious, I'm afraid) ""What's the New Mary Jane"" powerfully evokes an era. (""What's the New Mary Jane"" needs editing.) Paul McCartney's...oh...intimation of ""Step Inside, Love"" (written for Cilla Black) suggests to me that someone might consider releasing a compilation of Lennon-McCartney songs recorded by performers other than the Beatles--including Peter and Gordon's hit rendition of ""World Without Love"", for example.Recommended (for guitarists too): PENTATONIC SCALES FOR THE JAZZ-ROCK KEYBOARDIST by Jeff Burns."
2,Not Interested,"I love the Beatles, but am not interested in hearing how their materpieces were created. Most of the music is heard in it's experimental, initial stages, and often sounds disjointed and uninspired. It's really NOT, but the tape catches everything, the bum notes, out of tune singing, EVERYTHING!People who have been living under a rock and want to learn about the greatest group of all time should start by purchasing a copy of either Rubber Soul, Revolver, Pepper, The White Album, Let It Be, or Abbey Road. Finished product that's unsurpassed!"
2,Studio Out Takes - Buyer Beware,"If you are looking for a glimpse inside the recording sessions at Apple studios, then this might be a CD worth buying.If you are looking for a collection of Beatles music, stay far away.These are studio out takes and VERY rough cuts. The first CD is filled with what seem to be demo versions of songs. Usually a single member and an acoustic guitar without mixing nor accompanying harmony from other band members.While this is interesting, it has no replayablity, and leaves me yearning for the ""finished"" songs that are yet to come. Perhaps if the CD had the rough cut followed by the ""real"" version it would have some merit, but as it stands it seems a cynical ploy to sell studio tapes knowing that the public will buy anything Beatles, even though this denegrates the magic of Beatle Mania, rather than enhances it.I view this as [money] wasted."
5,Damn GOOd!,"VERY Interestng how THe Beatles Music Evolved ,ANd Became the most Beloved ANd Popular music of my generation and who knows how many to come!Great Outakes,I wonder what impact the same songs would have had if it came out in it's original form,or for that matter the unreleased ones which probably would have made great hits after a little more work on it and the studio????"
4,"When I grow up, I'll be a singer.","This was the final volume of the Beatles Anthology series of rarities. It's a two disc set, with Disc One featuringWhite Albumouttakes and Disc Two featuringAbbey RoadandLet It Berarities. A lot of this is demos or alternate versions of previously released songs, althought there are a few unreleased songs here. Of course, being the Beatles, most of it is very good, if not quite as good as the ""official"" versions of these songs. This is a must get for all Beatlemaniacs, although new Beatles fans should start with their regular albums before getting this."
3,money wasted!,"die hard fans beware!These are studio out takes and very rough cuts. The first CD is filled with what seem to be demo versions of songs. The record company EMI approached Messers. George Martin, Ringo Starr and Mc Cartney to do these series. Like many fans claimed this re-released are the most of rough out takes, rough studio chats, rough silly demo recordings.what a waste of money! many die hard fans are happy with it. so what can u do?The re-released albums from other better rock bands like Led Zeppelin, Black sabbath, or Deep Purple are much much better than this one. Because they are re-releasing different album versions, unreleased live albums & sets not like George Martin and Ringo Starr did."
1,To like the Beatles is to dislike this record.,"Rather a strange analogy. (Imagine if the sun were out twenty-fours a day.) In any case, if you really like the Beatles, then I think you should show it by disdaining this record. It was released twenty-six years after the Beatles disbanded, and the man who invented the Beatles, the smartest, most creative, and most interesting Beatle, was not around to approve its release."
1,out takes at a high price.,"Sorry I had to give the beatles only one star but I thought I had to get your attention.If you want out takes of John saying oops wrong cord or feedback through a whole song buy this cd.otherwise your money is better spent on the white album and let it be.I wish I had some better things to say about this cd, ok while my guitar gently wheeps was good but not worth the price of the cd. Can I get my money back?"
1,The Beatles Anthology,"Wish I had looked at the 1 star reviews, couldn't believe how bad this CD sounded. Wish it has stated that these were some of the attemps at playing the songs and not the real released versions.."
4,Fitting end,"Disorganized, chaotic, and yet still brilliant: a perfect snapshot of the Beatles' turbulent final period. While this collection doesn't reach the dizzying heights of their second anthology, this does contain some very pretty and telling versions of songs we have come to love. The Escher recordings, at George's house, are a particular delight. No new songs to sell the album, but it's still a wonderful example of how individual flashes of brilliance would continue to light the Beatles during their downfall."
4,Best of all anthologies,"Fittingly, this was the last Anthology in the series I heard. It grew on me too. What sets this apart from the others is there's no live material, which never were that great. The alternate versions of Helter Skelter, Sexy Sadie, and Obladi Oblada are quite interesting. Some versions of songs appearing on Let It Be are better then the original, such as For you Blue and The Long And Winding Road. What's The New Mary Jane and Not Guilty are great unreleased tracks. I even liked most of the acoustic demos. I agree with a past reviewer that this is best for a really big Beatle fan, such as myself. If you're a Beatle fan and don't have this album, better get it!"
4,Look...,"Many people are disappointed because they see hits like ""Hey Jude"" and ""Let It Be"" and expect it to be a best-of collection - no, it's an assortment of rarities & alternate takes, and intended for the fans who want to catch an earful of Beatles that they haven't yet heard after these thirty or so years since the band stopped making new music together.And as far as such collections go, this is very nice. The alternate takes can be strange, but they can also give well-known songs brand new life. The new songs are excellent. It should satisfy the fans, which the Beatles had many of. Casual listeners may be dismayed at the stripped-down performances and unfinished thoughts - but that's what this album is supposed to be. It's not a greatest hits package, it's a bunch of songs that have yet to be released or odd versions of the classics. On that level, it is a success."
3,"The acoustic stuff is great, rest is average","If it ain't acoustic on this cd, chances are it is forgettable. Alot of the tracks dont vary much from the originals and many are boring. The standouts (aside from the acoustic songs) are Not Guilty, and Paul's ""one man band"" recording of ""Come And Get It"", which sounds exactly, if not slightly better than the Badfinger version. Still a great collection, just dont expect to get blown away. I wonder why ""Grow Old with Me"" which was to be the 3rd new Lennon/Beatles track after ""Free As A Bird"" and ""Real Love"" was never recorded/released, as was originally planned? A great tune that one, one could only imagine the Beatle treatment..."
5,The Final Chapter,"Anthology 3 covers the expansive White album sessions as well as the Abbey Road and Get Back/Let it Be recordings. It is amazing that even after all the great music they made in 1966-67, they would still have such a catalog of songs. It is interesting to hear songs that would eventually appear on solo albums like ""All Things Must Pass"" and ""Junk"" in the context of a Beatles album and to her the Let It Be songs in their raw, un-Spectorized versions. A great final chapter to the revealing and enlightening Anthology series."
3,Soft Porn only,"This video was something my ex-wife rented back when I was still stationed in Germany. She had no idea what it was...it just looked like typical ""girly love crap"". Well, she made me watch it, and wow!!!! was it good! Great looking women having sex. Needless to say, my ex did not like it, but it was a favorite of mine...hahahahaha."
2,Disappointing,"I enjoy just about every type of mystery, but found this collection disappointing, even dull."
3,Ratchet Pruners are the Best-but not this one!,"Being female, I use ratchet pruners in yard work because they allow me to cut thicket stems without muscle strength. The price of these pruners was right, so I ordered a pair. Imagine my surprise when I realized my hand wasn't large enough to allow the mouth of the pruners to open more than an inch. These pruners will only open to their full size for a person with very large hands. My hands are a size seven. Even my husband, who has size 9 hands, complained that he had to let the grip on one side go before placing the pruner on a branch. Once on the branch it takes two hands to make them operate! Very Disappointing! Stick to ""Florian"" pruners...more expensive ...but no problems!"
4,Cuts smooth and clean,I'm really glad I tried out this pruner. It is the best I've had so far and I have 60+ roses to prune. I haven't had it long enough to rate it's durability but I do know it cuts smooth and clean. And it cuts through some hefty canes. Be sure to remember it has rachet action and let go and reapply pressure for your cut. Excellent pruner for the price.
4,Economical and Easy to use,This ratchet pruner is lightweight and easy to use. It cuts branches in a snap without tearing up your hands. Super sharp.
1,"""Ponch"" on crack","If you watched CHiP's for years waiting for Ponch to pull his gun or drop the ""F"" bomb, then this may be your movie. Filled with 80's, early 90's cheese; compleate with girl band montages and female wrestlers in tiny swim suits. About a biker who kills a dirty cop and then leaves to protect the gang, only to be framed by the dead cops partner who turns the gang against him. If you love B biker movies this will be right up your alley. If you are looking for a movie with sceans of vintage bikes this is not your movie as there are only scant shots of near modern day Evo's. Over all not a bad flick for your biker movie collection, with an ending only slightly better than ""Hells Angles on Wheels""."
5,The Last Riders,Sorry I am not able to review this film. I live in the Philippines and operate Hard Riders Bar & Grill. The movie was sent to my son and he has not forwarded it to me yet. When the bar is first opening in the afternoon I like to put on a biker movie instead of using the DJ. A lot of bikers love to come in just to watch the films. By the way I am an American and ride a Harley here I even have two. One in the barfor display and I ride one to work. Am always looking for new Biker movies. Thanks I am sure it and the others will be fine!
3,Should be titled RV camping in Mexico.,All in all not a bad guidebook but definitely geared towards RV camping. We spent our time camping in tents and on beaches and this guidebook left a little to be desired.
2,The Service is Not Good,"I ordered and was billed for two white leotards and only received one. I e-mailed the company regarding this, they replied with requesting an account number. The bill that I have, doesn't have an account number on it. I told them this and never heard from them again.The leotard that I did received, is thinner than what I normally wear."
3,waterproof thank goodness,I miss Max Factor white Erase - the best. But this is an okay substitute. Important to me is waterproof factor. Covers well but stick is not very thick and it breaks off rather easily. Price is reasonable.
1,Cover stick...,"So i was pretty excited that i got this in the mail, but seriously.....i think its just the color of mine, i don't know, not good cover stick... Received it sticking to the top...so basically it was broken when i opened it because of the air mail looks very pasty...very white i shall say...im never buying this product ever.."
5,hard to find,"I can't find this in the stores. My skin is so fair, I use white for conceler and highlights. This is perfect"
3,Not long Enough,"This is a very good air conditioner. It works very well, but there is one problem it doesnt last long enough. Ounce you get the frozen water from the freezer and put it in the air conditioner it lasts for about 10 minutes on a hot day, and thats when you need it. If your buying this item to cool down a small room, it doesnt work!!"
1,There are worse things than death...,"And buying this failure is one of them. Using this little bugger to cool yourself off is as smart an idea as is using an airplane to kill a mosquito. It just doesn't get the job done effectively. The ""breeze"" can only be felt two inches beyond the vent."
1,Desk top air conditioner,Don't waste money on this. Fan strength is terrible. The only one's kept cool by this item are the sellers - who are fanning themselves with the cash that I paid.
2,"Great idea, but NOT worth the time.","An air cooler is the more appropriate name for this. It was a great idea, but it needed to be a lot more rugged. It would appear that the slightest drop on the floor or knock with a book on your desk would destroy the weak fan. 4 Things wrong with it:- Should have come with more water bottles so that you can switch.- The fan is VERY weak.- Limited 30 day warranty (or 45 or 90 day). I understand now why the warranty is so short.- It does NOT come with a power cord. Had to spend about $17 @ radio shack to get the cord and the correct adapter.I plugged another adapter (a bit overrated) and the speed of the fan increased significantly. But after a day or even less than that, the fan burned out. But the fan wasn't even blowing that hard anyway to begin with :(Just save your money and get a REAL air conditioner. That's what I ended up doing."
3,average,Only works if you're sitting right in front of it and the ice melts very quickly. I wish I would of read the other reviews before I bought it.
1,Portable air conditioner,I wasn't very happy with this product. It claimed to be a air conditioner but a regular fan would have worked better. Don't waist your money on this.
1,waste of money! get a fan instead,"the cool air canbarely be felt unless u literally stick it right at ur face......waste of money! Also the water that you freeze placed on the unit quickly melts because of the hotness, and barely lasts 30 minutes.save your money and get a fan instead, waste of time and money!"
1,you get what you pay for..........,"The problem with cheap solutions is cheap results. I live in the desert and this wonderfully simple contraption consists of a small fan and a frozen water bottle. I find myself attaching the water bottle to a larger fan from a peice of string and doing nothing with the plastic encased toy fan. The freezable water bottle it comes with also leaks so............ If you want to pay a little amount of money for something you know is going to dissapoint you then by all means, go ahead!!!!"
1,Sending it back,"I bought this little fan because my car AC was not working well, and I thought that it would help keep me cool in this record breaking heat wave we had. Well, if I held it up to my face while driving, it created a slight breeze! There is absolutely not enough force to cool from a desk, or anywhere else, I even checked to make sure the batteries were fresh. This definitely is going back, and I will think twice before I order on-line again."
1,Silly..,It might work great indoors but when ur in an un air condition truck I don't think anything would work
1,A Mess,"Although there are some random clevernesses in this, I doubt they would be worth it for most folks. The author's complete surrender to pun instead of state makes this work a slough of despond."
4,THE BEST OF THE BEST,"SONS OF THE SAN JUAQUIN ARE THE BEST IN THE BUSINESS RIGHT NOW AND THIS CD EXEMPLIFIES WHY. THE SONGS ARE GREAT, THE MUSIC IS SOOTHING AND THE HARMONY IS FAMILY."
1,WATCH OUT ! ! You do NOT get pictured items.,"WATCH OUT ! ! You do NOT get pictured items.Manufacturer's description says: ""Packs"" and ""pads"" (plural).But the next paragraph clarifies ""black"" and ""pack"" (just one)."
1,attitude of author did not reflect title,"When I came across this book, I hoped that I had discovered a treasure. Once in a while I will find a book of nature and introspection that takes a place among my personal classics. This definitely was not one of these jewels. Richard Bode comes across as anything but ""authentic"". He seems extremely smug and extremely judgemental. If you expect a soul-broadening experience, forget it. He sounds like a rich, nasty, and self-satisfied old spoiled brat and reading his book will only make you feel sour."
1,A bitter old coot!,"I could hardly wait to read Mr. Bode's next book since I enjoyed ""First You Have To Row A Little Boat."" What a disappointment! He seemed to value himself as the only one who understood how to comb the beach. He sounded so disrespectful of the private lives of his neighbors and fancied he could analyze their relationship. His repose from the frantic multiplicity of his life was a wonderful place to start, but he seemed to fill that time in pompous isolation."
5,IT SO MOVED ME...I WENT TO MIRAMAR...TO FIND MYSELF,This book found me as I walked into a bookstore alone on Thanksgiving 1999. It was featured in a rack as I walked in..heartbroken at my recently failed marriage of 15+years. My business was failing as well. To say the book inspired me and helped me get back to feeling good about life is an understatement. I decided to go to Miramar for New Year's Eve 1999 and beachcomb. I reread the book on the beach over several days to savor Mr Brode's prose and wisdom. Since then I have gone back on many New Year's Eves to Miramar...to reread the book and relish the experience. You owe it to yourself to join in this man's wonderful journey. Thank you Mr. Brode for the gift you've given all of us.
2,Not All Celts Come From Ireland,This movie is a fast and loose stab at telling the tale of the English Celtic queen Boadicea (or Boudica)although apparently at least one reviewer thinks she was Irish. All a bit too sword and sorcery-like for me. Costuming for the Iceni tribe and particularly for the heroine was atrocious and unrepresentative. Since the only written narrative of the rebellion came from the Romans we have only their inherent biases to go on for historical accuracy. This is a story that longs to be told and filmed well...this attempt just isn't it.
4,Warrior Queen,"Alex Kingston is excellent in her role as Queen Boudica. It's the supporting cast and script that destroy this average film.There are so many modern lines in this film, it almost makes me laugh. There is a line where a man says ""hack"" in his sentence (!). However, I found the direction in this film to be excellent,and the locations are beautiful. I personally enjoyed this filmfor it's somewhat disturbing truth, yet I still agree with other people in saying that this film isn't that true to life back then. Pretty good."
2,Not worth buying it!,It's a movie about a warrior princes who stood against the Roman Emperor. Nice story but cheep production and medium acting. Don't waste your money on that.
1,the worst t.v show mini-series ever,"This ""movie"" is absolutely horrible. I stopped watching after 5 minutes.One of the reviewers said the Roman costumes looked like they were foil. He/she wasn't lying. The Roman costumes look like they were cut out of cardboard and then taped together. I have never seen anything so ghetto in my life (on video). The Celtic costumes looked a little better; on the other hand, how hard is it to recreate a costume that resembles rags?The acting looked pretty uninspired.The sound editing was also horrid. I skipped around to see the battle scene, and it looks like they didn't even bother to add in any sound effects.Have you ever seen ""Druids"" (starring Christopher Lambert)? That's a t.v mini-series that deals with Vercingtorix. Anyways, that show runs circles around ""Warrior Queen."" That's how bad ""Warrior Queen"" really is. Whoever produced this movie doesn't deserve a single penny for this ghetto flick."
2,Not good,"If you know anything about Boudicca and are looking for a both entertaining and accurate movie, your half right. Entertaining it is, accurate, far from it.To give away what has been edited or deleted from the facts would give away the story, but as someone who is educated on her story,I was not pleased. If I would have known how inaccurate this movie was, I would have not purchased it."
2,Not up to Masterpiece Theater Standards,"I wouldn't know about the historical inaccuracies some mentioned here, but I was expecting a bit more. I am familiar with her story and was eager to enjoy this, but it just felt flat for a PBS produced piece. There is a film in production on Boudica, but I don't know its status."
2,Boudicca Warrior Queen,"I am English and watched this when it was aired on British television. Unable to obtain it on region 2, an American friend sent me it for my multi regional dvd player. What a disappointment, if you are watching this Masterpiece Theatre version, it is heavily cut, and I would have asked my friend not to have wasted his money.I do not know why they have edited it as some of the scenes missed out are integral to the story. Very disappointing and would not recommend unless you can get the uncut version."
1,save your $$$,"First, this is a typical of movie of that era to use the gorgeous Sybil Danning in the cast to sell this soft core of unknown actresses.Believe me, you won't even see her ankles.Second, all these pirated DVD's are a terrible VCR transfer. It is so embarrassing. At least they could have adjusted the tracking.The quality is so bad you have to squint just to see her face."
5,Great book for beginning investors!,"This is a clear, well-written, easy-to-understand book that is ideal for people wanting to know more about saving and investing. The book is written in layman's term with lots of graphics and illustrations that make it an easy read for investors of all levels. I strongly recommend this book, and have personally given away a half dozen copies to various friends and relatives over the past year."
5,Great Book!,"I thought that the book was very good. I don't usually read stories about wars, but this really appealed to me. It was a collection of letters written by a young man fighting in World War 2 back home to his family. I thought that as a young man, he made very astute observations about the changes in the world around him and the consequences of the war on the people all around him. I couldn't put it down!"
5,I Know What You Did Last Summer,I Know What You Did Last summer was an extremely intriguing book. It always keeps you on your toes. Why? There is a murderer on the loose. I Know What You Did Last Summer this little boy gets demolished by a car. This book is very spooky. As you get deeper into the book the suspense gets greater and greater and you just cant put it down.
5,I never wanted this book to end!!,"This book sparked my interest after I saw the motion picture ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"". I wanted to see how close the movie was to the book. Much to my surprise the movie did not even come close. The book is an absolute thriller, 10 times better than the movie. I was hoping that the pages would go on forever, so I could keep reading it. I read the entire thing in one day, because after I started reading I could not stop. It's is totally awesome!"
2,The Book? The Movie? The difference!,"O.K. When I read I Know What You Did Last Summer by Lois Duncan, I thought. ""This book is pretty good, I wonder what the movie will be like?"" It turns out that in the book NO ONE dies! The worst that happens is someone jumps out of a two story high window-- and lives, and someone gets shot-- and lives! Then to top it all off, at the end you expect the kids to let the stalker guy have it? Right? No. They hit him in the head with a flashlight and call the police, he then gets taken to jail! In the movie, people were getting ripped to shreds and that IS NOT how the book went at all! And even though I loved the movie and thought it was much better than the book, I think Mandaly Entertainment just turned a suspensful plot into a great horror movie."
1,I Know What You Did Last Summer,This Book is a horror story! It was a great book! It was about four teenagers who accidently killed a little boy on a bicycle riding in the middle of the night. When they hit him they just left the bike and they repainted the car.Then they went to the first phone they found. They called the police to tell them they spotted a accident of a little boy on the bike the man asked him his name and than he hung up from then on they made a promise not to tell anyone about what happened that summer. I think about what they should of done is wrong cause maybe if they would of told them about what happened it might of been okay. They went threw the whole story without someone knowing. Then one day Julie get a letter. She is scared. Than Barry just says it some prank. I liked this story alot and the movie is great to. Then the killer haunts them and kills Helen and Barry. Julie and Ray live.
1,super horrible!!!!,"I don't know if you can say this on here, but this book really, really SUCKED!!!!! I don't know why everybody raves about it. Lois Duncan did NOT live up to her full potential when she wrote this book. I would give it 0 stars, but they don't let you do that. DON'T READ THIS BOOK!!!!"
1,what a snore!!!,"I was expecting something really exciting from this book the way everyone raves about it.... but I was REALLY, REALLY, let down! I love Lois Duncan's other books which have a lot of action and are really unpredictable. I Know What You Did Last Summer is really predictable and doesn't have that many twists in it. These are just my thoughts on the book, but I encourage you to read Lois Duncan's other books like Killing Mr. Griffin, Down a Dark Hall, Stranger With My Face, Summer of Fear, Ransom, and The Twisted Window. These are much more imaginative and exciting! PLEASE!!!"
2,"""Frankenstein""","This age old novel ""Frankenstein"", was simply superb. The story's plot united three exciting elements: horror,action, and romance. Mary Shelly did a spectacular job on this one. This novel kept the reading light on all night and into the early ours of the morning. I found excitement on every page. I strongly recommend this book to anyone wholikes a good story, but has patience. By this I mean you must geet through the beginning pages to get to the interesting part of the novel. Trust me, it's worth it. One of the interesting parts of this novel is that we could actually create anartificial lifeform in a laboratory. This is what Dr. Frankenstien did. This creation that was supposed to be perfect turned ou to be a monster. Frankenstien was rejected by society because of the way he appeared. This rejection caused the monster to become violent. It was very interesting to read about how someting that was intended to be so good could actually turn out so bad."
4,A Good Old Fashioned Thriller,"Here is a thriller with no sex or gore. Just a tale of 4 teenagers that accidently kill a boy through a hit and run accident. Afterwards, they are emotionally torn by living with the ""secret."" About a year later they start receiving strange things starting with a card that says ""I Know What You Did Last Summer."" This causes them to relive the horror and regret of what they had done and maybe think about telling the police.The tension really starts to build after one of the teens get shot. You get close to the end you wonder how it will wrap up but it does."
3,My book Review,"The book is not very good because the book no have pictures and no have killing,the movie is very good because have a pictures and in the movie have more pictures. Manuel Sanchez"
1,The boring book,I know what you did last summer is a boring book.It was boringbecause it was not scary. My friends tell me that the movie is alot better.I think other kids should read this book. Denise Campos
1,so so book,"The movie is better than the book, because the movie has more action.In the book the killer does not kill people. I think you should read the book, so you can see the difference."
2,The boring book.,"No, I would not tell kids to read this book, because the book was boring. There was no killing people. The book was very different from the movie.In the movie they kill a man and in the book they kill a kid. [...]"
2,The Sleeping Book,We read this book in my reading class. I thought it was boring. I thought it was going to be like the movie. The movie is a lot scarier. I would not tell other kids to read it. [...]
5,A great suspense for teens.,"I really enjoyed this book a lot and it had a great story to it. These teens ran over a kid riding a bicycle and now they're getting a bunch of notes that say ""I know what you did last summer."" What they are trying to forget cannot stay behind. It will refuse to."
3,it ok,this book was ok pll i know call it horror i think more of drama and msytery i liked the movie alot more the book was good but kind of slow
3,Pretty ok,...I read I know what you did last summer. Its a very good book. Its about a group of kids that accidentaly hit this guy. Then sometime in the next school year one of the kids in the group gets a note that says I know what you did last summer. Then she tells every one else in the group of kids. Then they try to figure out who it is. Then this guy that looks like a fisherman with a hook. He starts killing the people in the group. Then they figure out who the guy is from this old lady.I wont tell you what happens in the end though.It is a good book so get it. I was so curious to find out who it was.
1,*The most boring book*.,I did not like this book becauseI thought it was going to be scary. It was boring and not interesting to me. I am going to rent the movie because my friends told me the movie was better.I think everyone should give it a try. Ivonne Lozoya
4,An okay read,"This book, unlike it's movie, had a GOOD storyline. Lois was able to keep the reader up half the night because they couldn't put it down! However, this book was not able to get to the action quick enough! It was an excellent book, don't get me wrong. It was very descriptive, and very enjoyable. It kept you on the edge of your seat, thinking ""will they find out?"" But it never had much action, however the twist was amazing!"
3,Okay,"My daughter needed to read a mystery book for school. She said the ending didn't quite make sense. But then again, she dislikes mystery books."
2,I Know,"Me, being a very big fan of Lois Duncan well, I was very dissapointed in the book. I saw the movie first and I guess that spoiled it. In my opinion, the movie was a lot better. The book wasn't very exciting and after seeing the movie it was dry with excitment and dull."
2,I was very disapointed,"Well to start out with, it wasn't very intense or tension filled like so many other of Duncan's books (like Locked in time, or don't look behind you) I saw the movie later on and it was fantastic. But the book was dull"
5,"Who cares what the movie's like, the book's great!","Now, I can't tell you if the movie or the book is better because I havn't seen the movie. I believe that the book should not be compared to the movie. They are two very different plots. I had to read this book for school. I thought it was great! Who cares what the movie's like. Enjoy the book, then go and see the movie. You can form your own opnions. I advise that if you like suspense, you should definitely read this book. It's great!"
5,Be ready to be scared out of your skin!!,"In this book one accident will change the lives of four teens forever. In this story Julie, Ray, Barry and Heller try to find out who is stalking them. But how much will he put them through before he gives himself up? If you like mystery, excitement and being scared out of your skin, this book is for you! The book is way better than the movie!!"
4,suspensful and always keeping you on the edge of your seat.,"I Know What You Did Last Summer consist of four kids that hit a man in the middle of the road and have been trying to hide it ever since. But one day Julie, one of the kids in the car recieved a letter saying ""I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER"". Who it is nobody knows."
3,Mi opinion for I Know What You Did Last Summer,"Hello, I'm going to tell you a little about this book .It is not that good, but it is sort of interesting because, in the movie it's a man who gets hit by the car. Barry does not get shot in the stomache, but gets murdered with a hook. The movie is totally different. Eri lonzo"
4,Check This One Out SOON!,"The novel I read was wrote by a great author by the name of Lois Duncan. She writes really good mystery stories about killings with college kids. Lois writes with a lot of enthusiasm. She likes to let you know who the characters are well in advance with a lot of detail. She made it feel like I knew all the characters before I read the book. She writes great books with fast paces. I like her novels because they give a lot of details and keep you interested in the book. This book was about four kids hitting a boy on the way home from a party when Barry ( a college boy ) spill alcohol all over the inside of the car and makes Ray, the driver of the car, swerve and hit a boy. This is how the book starts and it has a lot of spooky turns and scary incidents with all of the characters. I didn't like this book for one reason. It had too many plot changes in a small amount of time, and some points it got really confusing."
1,I thought this book realy bit the dust .,I thought this book wasn't that good.The begining was good but from there it went down hill. It was so bad i did not even finnish the book. This is all my opinion you should read the book to find out for your self. To me the book was bad enough for me not to even rate it .but if i didi it would be rated a 1 or 2 star book.Then agen read the book for yourself to find out.
1,"OK, i Know What You Did Last Summer is KOOKY!","I loved this movie but the book wasn't nearly as good. It made people NOT wanna see tha movie which is horrible. If i could give any advice it would be, Don't read the book first. Go rent tha movie. You'll loooove it."
3,"Suspense, but no horror","This book bears little resemblance to the slasher film that starred Sarah Michelle Gellar and Jennifer Love Hewitt in 1997. Four teenagers involved in a hit-and-run accident that killed a small boy find mysterious notes that imply that someone, somewhere knows about the accident and might expose their involvement (the four made a pact to keep quiet since there were presumably no witnesses). It's the characters' varied reactions to the notes that keeps the plot running; I figured out who it was before the end of the book, however."
3,The note was there,"I remember readingA Gift of Magicby Lois Duncan back in the 70s and loving it. So when I saw this reissue of ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" I couldn't resist picking it up to see how much I would like another of Ms. Duncan's books. And even though I enjoyed ""I Know What You Did Last Summer,"" the book seemed really dated to me. Not just the 1970s time frame of it, but also the language and Ms. Duncan's formal style of writing. The narrative was stilted and overwritten at times, and the characters didn't always seem quite real to me. And though I did get caught up in the story, I had to keep in mind that it was probably geared to a middle grade rather than a teen audience, since the mystery's solution seemed obvious. And perhaps the crazed Vietnam War veteran was not quite the cliche in 1973 that it is now, but I cringed over it nonetheless."
4,I Know What You Did Last Summer,"I Know What You Did Last Summer is an exciting book at the end. It is kind of boring at the beginning. It was a suspensful, exciting book.Someone knows what happened last summer and is out to get them"
2,C+,"To tell you the truth, I was very disappointed with this book. From the movie previews, it seemed like the book would be very exciting. It wasn't though. Most of the book is flashbacks and conversation between one another. Being a very big fan of Louis Duncan (the author of the book) I would have to say this is my least favorite book by her."
3,Not as good as the movie!!!,"The characters were simple, you either hated them or loved them. It wasn't terrible, but this is the first case I know of where the movie is actually better then the book. The movie is only based on the book. If you read the book before you watch the movie or visa versa, it won't ruin the ending either way."
5,Very exciting!!,"This story is a wonder! That's all you can really say to describe this book! It's very exciting and full of suspense! Even though it is not at all like the movie, this story will still keep you up at night!"
4,I think the book was good.,"I think the book is good because it's very surprising. You would think that the book would not be related to the movie that much, but it was. I liked when they hit the boy and ran him over. Mary, Julie and the other girls and boys were nervous when they ran the boy over. Another part I liked was when Julie got the note that said I know what you did last summer. I would recommend it to anyone who saw the movie and liked it."
4,Il ike it and it was great.,It was great and I had a good time reading it. I know you would like it too. Have fun reading it.And I think it was good for someone to read.
3,"Suspenseful, yes; dumb ending","Well I enjoyed this book right up till the ending. How anti climatic can you get? Oh Helen is rummaging through her medicine cabinet to see what she can find to use against her attacker! Cut to Julie's house and the final scene and the sap Ray says in the end. Give me a break! Note, this book was originally published in 75 so a lot of things are so retro that well, kind of makes you laugh compared to the pop culture of today. Still, it gripped me but I was hoping more in the end. Too much sugar coating Lucy darling!"
3,A VERY DESCRIPIVE BOOK!!,"I Know What You Did Last Summer is a very well written book.The characters fully play thier part, and are described in their best detail. The setting can jump from a peaceful conversation by a hot pool side, to a scene of a bloody mess.Troughout the book, the characters hold within them selves the most unbearable secret,but is never to be told.The information has accidentaly leaked,and now they must pay for what they have done.All of thier lives are threatened,and even one was shot. Louis Duncan is a very interesting writer and knows how to put her mind on paper. While reading her book, there can be times when you can be peacefully reading, and other times, youcan be left on the edge of your seet.I recommend this book to every reader looking for an easy novel to read, and at the same time, to be entertained.As you read I Know What You Did Last Summer, you will find your fingers turning the pages much faster."
3,It was very good but not scary enough.,I liked this book very much but it just wasn't scary enough.The movie was very good but I thought the book was better.If this book had more mystery to it then it would be a better book. I recomend this book to people who like a little scare.
3,"I thought it was weak, and Williamson did it a favor.","I read the book and I mean HEY it was good but it was not really a thriller. It was lacking in the gore and even less suspenseful. I hate being right when I guess who the killer is in the first hour of reading the book, but I was. I'm sure it was QUITE the scary novel back in the day but it just wasn't a page-turner for me."
3,It was a very good book but not scary anough.,It was a very good book but not scary anough.I thought the book was better than the movie.This book would be good for readers who like non-stop horror.
3,My book Review,"The book is not very good because the book no have pictures and no have killing,the movie is very good because have a pictures and in the movie have more pictures."
1,The novel needed to be alot more interesting!,I found that the novel was totally not interesting at all. It needed to be more of keep you on the edge of your seat type of thing. I liked the movie alot better because it was more of a horror flick. The novel was just boring. Like no offense or anything but in the novel nobody died. Like you have to have some kind of like sad part in it.
4,Kady's book review,"I read ""I know what you did last summer"" by Lois Duncan. This book is about a girl named Julie James. Who was involved in hit and run freak accident with her three friends Helen, Barry, and Ray. This car accident caused the death of a pedestrian on a bicycle, or so they thought.Julie has dealt with the guilt of not saying anything to the police or anybody else about what she knows. She decided to try and push the memory out of her life because of a pact that Barry made the four of them make, saying that they swear to never mention the incident again. Julie was trying to get her life back together until one day when she got a letter in the mail saying ""I know what you did last summer."" From then on the four friends continually got harassed about the situation by an unknown someone. To find out what happens you have to read the book.I think this was a good book. I would recommend it to people who like suspense and excitement."
4,I know what you did last summer...not as good as the movie..,"This book was not as good as the movie, but it still was a great book. It was written in the 1970s, though. If you liked this book, check out Lois Duncan's other books!! I love her books."
2,Letters don't read,"I love to purchase fun educational toys for my children and was excited to get this home for them. When each block is dragged across the desk it is supposed to ""read"" each block. The blocks should say the letter, the sound it makes and a word beginning with the letter. Unfortunately, the desk doesn't always read the letters and it often took several tries before it did. There are games that can be played too, but my children never got that far since they couldn't get it to respond properly. This would be a great toy if it worked as it is described by the manufacturer. Fisher-Price needs to improve this toy before I would recommend anyone to buy this. I think the LeapFrog Read and Write Phonics desk is a better purchase if you are looking for a toy that will help with letter recognition, phonics, writing, and spelling games."
5,EXCELLENT MultiSensory Literacy tool for kids withLowVision,"We are going to try this product with our vision impaired children as, not only does it provide feedback to the student based on its gross motor design, tactile surface and its auditory component, it also has Braille letters! The perfect way to get a Junior Kindergarten child's literacy on the right track! It is also excellent for auditory learners, kids who need tactile reinforcement as well as visual cues! Thanks Fisher Price - a very well conceived product!"
1,"Pretty cheap, pass on these","I bought these and finally set one up on Halloween. Intended to use all three, but it was so cheap and didnt fit together well, I had to tape it together, threw it out today. Asking for a refund for the other two"
4,Grabber,"Clever, twisting plotwork here...and a good long look at a job that is as fascinating as it is gory: cleaning up crime scenes. The main character is completely believable as well as likeable."
5,Solid and Entertaining Story,"Really enjoyed this Novelette. It's short and sweet and to the point. A little easy to figure out what has happened before the ending, but still worth it. Supernatural story or real life? As usual, if you like Masterton, you will enjoy this one too."
5,One of his best!,"Okay, so it isn't pounding, gross-out, fingernails-scratching-at-walls traditional horror. This is a slow, almost gentle character study. Masterton doesn't even bother to hide where he is going. The very fact that someone does a job like Bonnie's in the real world is disturbing enough. That we like her so much we begin to descend in hell along with her is VERY upsetting. I like pulp horror too (Harry Shannon's ""Night of the Beast"" being the most recent example of a well done rollercoaster ride)but this one is something altogether different. Settle in for a quiet, skin-crawling text about true psychological horror and you won't be disappointed. Subtle and dazzling. I think it is one of Masterton's best."
3,Strange but OK,"Very strange indeed! I guess I would call this a fantasy and a satire. Interesting, but so far out there somewhere. I kind of liked it, but it left me confused. Weird!"
3,Long Walk,"Like many Vonnegut novels this one takes a long walk to deliver a sparse messge. As usual Vonnegut's social satire is entertaining although a little unfocused here. Still, his writing skill is undeniable."
4,"""Lonesome no more""? Yes","Slapstick was a great novel because Kurt Vonnegut Showed all characteristics of Wilbur and Eliza and with all their adventures they went through, Kurt Vonnegut said it like if he went through it for real but we all know he would have hade to be some ugly guy for him to go through this.Hi HOThis book is great even for those who think they had felt some lonely some through out there livesHi HO."
4,Still Better than Most,"Like most of Vonngut's work, Slapstick is a critical look at American values and culture. It's told as a memior from the point of view of the last President of the United States before the fall from a technological height and back toward barbarism...which just might be better after all. While not pinnacle Vonnegut on the level of Mother Night, Cat's Cradle, Breakfast of Champions, God Bless You Mr. Rosewater, or Slaughterhouse-5, it is better than what 99% of what is out there. Highly recommended."
3,"Entertaining, but where's the literary merit?!?!?","This book was entertaining, but nothing stellar. I used it in this year's AP English exam, as an example of a book that was more interesting because of its ""wild and free thinking."" I mentioned orgies, gravity-induced erections, and drugs. I think it is a great example of wild and free thinking, I just hope the AP essay readers don't think _I'm_ the sicko. It's a nice summer read, and the style is a little wacky and a usually entertaining enough to make you want to keep reading. I have yet to read Slaughterhouse 5, and I'm not sure if this book makes me want to read another Vonnegut book. Maybe I'll give it a try and hope he can prove his literary talent a bit more..."
2,What's so great about it?,Another lukewarm read. The quirkiness of it all was pretty annoying. Vonnegut loves writing about driftwood characters who live life getting pulled in and out by the tide. I suppose they reflect his own personality type. Very unmemorable story.
2,not the right book for first time Vonegut readers,"I didn't know what to expect because this was my very first time reading Kurt Vonnegut's work. I hated it. It seemed silly, pointless, and strange. I couldn't deal with it. I don't ever want to read Kurt Vonnegut ever again. It's not awful. It was a shock. I've never read anything like it before, and it doesn't gently ease you into it.If you do read it, know that it's extremely quirky. If that's your style, go for it."
1,A real dog ... what was he thinking?,"One of Vonnegut's worst. The plot and characters are all over the map. There is a lot of sillyness, as usual for KV, but undirected sillyness. He's not telling us anything, just enough bizarre vignettes to fill up a book.I've read almost everything he's ever written (except Palm Sunday, which is next) and this, along with Hocus Pocus, were the only two disappointments."
1,"I agree, it is his best work.","Suitable for death row inmates, except it violates the constitutional right against cruel and unusual punishment. If this saves anyone from reading this deranged novel, then I just spent a productive five minutes."
3,A struggle,"This was not the easiest book to get into at all. I like the concept of having a 12-fingered/toed, anomalously tall and genetically odd person and his twin sister, with him becoming the President of the United States, and how his idea of using names to make people ""lonesome no more"" camr to be, and how rather Communist it really was, but it didn't really satisfy me that way other Vonnegut novels have in the past. Plus, he says 'hi ho,' more times than he should in this book. True, this was probably Vonnegut's definitive 'slapstick comedy' novel, but some of the story did not flow with each other, and the ending was pretty predictable."
5,Find yourself rethinking the obvious and loving it.,"When reading Vonnegut, I find myself rethinking subjects I pass over in day-to-day life without a second thought. It makes me feel enlightened, like I have some unique perspective on the world. In reality, the only credit I deserve is for my choice of reading material. Vonnegut so effectively carries his reader to a different point from which to view the world that you barely notice that you didn't get there yourself. What could be a greater testament to an author than that?All of Vonnegut's novels accomplish the same feat, but this one does it more, or better. As this book wound down, I became sad - not because I didn't want the story to end, but because I didn't want the feeling of seeing the world from a unique place to end. Fortunately, once you put the book down, a lot of that new perspective stays with you.This is a great book for anyone who wants to see the world in ways they haven't before. Very highly recommended."
5,Loved it - All other's opinions dismissed!,"I absolutely love this book. It was the 2nd Vonnegut I read (after Breakfast of Champions). I subsequently read Galapagos and Mother Night.I have to, thusfar, rank Slapstick in a dead heat with Galapagos as my fave's from Vonnegut.I am not one to laugh out loud (to this point) at Vonnegut, but he does make me think - and that is the best recommendation I can give.Want a real belly laugh -read something absurdly funny like The Hitchiker's Guide.. a great book in that vein. If you wan't a great thinker - with an occasional grimace or smile... pick up some Vonnegut.Hi Ho.Will 'Wolfsbane-13' Morgan"
4,an absurd page turner,i finished slapstick in two days. the pace of the novel is fast and definitely diverts from monotony. the book is often humorous and contains some brilliant satire. this is vintage vonnegut however i do not think this is one of his best works.
3,"Dismissed by the author, ""Slapstick"" looks better over time","When ""Slapstick"" was released, it invoked a critical backlash that Vonnegut could not possibly have been prepared for. Most saw the story as sick, uninventive, and unfunny, and Vonnegut himself in ""Palm Sunday"" rated the book a dismal D -, saying that he may have written a truly awful book.Well, he didn't. Sure, ""Slapstick"" does not sit in the same category as his best, but it is very entertaining all the same; right down to all that bizarre miniature Chinese experimental stuff. If you're new to Vonnegut, read something else. But if you've written this one off, check it out."
4,A very worthwhile collection,"I'm not usually too fond of compilations but this is an exception. Plenty of good tunes, a couple of oversweet shockers, but well worth the effort"
5,SOUTH AFRICAN HARMONY AT ITS FINEST,"Purchased Voices From Heaven,after seeing a liveperformance of ""Blessed."" While the audio only albumcannot fully describe the songs on this album,the waya live video can,it was still very enjoyabloe.The harmonywas at times ""soul wrenching."" The presentation,captivating!My favorite songs were: ""Ahuna Ya Twanag Le Jesu"" (NobodyLike Jesus,)The classic South African Lullabye ""Thula Baba""and the Johnny Clegg standard ""My African Dream."" This wasan outstanding performance.I wish I had seen it live."
4,Nice and relaxing,"I found that this CD was very, very enjoyable to listen to, the music when in English was accessible, when it was not, just purely relaxing and in no short order, helped me feel the spirit. There are no chants and songs with lyrics that are repeated over and over and over again here. Just simple music that would serve to uplift the mind and the spirit."
1,"I bought it after hearing one song, but it is only good one on the album","Most of us are accustomed to being able to download individual songs, but that option wasn't available in Australia so I purchased the album on spec - and was very disappointed. I can understand why people might resort to pirating stuff from the internet after feeling dudded."
4,great african gospel music,"really good album. uplifting. some of the songs sound similar, but it's all really good. i enjoy soweto gospel choir, and would recommend this album if you're going to buy something of theirs."
1,A waste of money,"Out of 172 pages, 40 are blank so you can write your own diary and 40 pages are about this woman's complaints about doctors, fibromyalgia complaints and what meds she's been on. Her ""cure"" is natural progesterone and you'd be better off buying Dr. Lee's book, What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About Menopause/Premenopause. He's got far more information than this book. I'm sending mine back for a credit."
1,I Conquered Fibromyalgia and turned horror moans into hormon,"If this book had only cost 10 cents it would have still been a waste of money. If this lady was cured that easily, why aren't all the doctors specializing in Fibromyalgia using these treatments. I live in a rural area and had no trouble finding someone who knew what fibromyalgia was and is very willing to work with me on any treatments that I want. I am also seeing a pain management specialist who is the same way. Be smart, do your own research as there is plenty of reliable information out there such as the Fibromyalgia Newsletter. Also, when you are already living on the fixed income of disability and medicare, you cannot afford massage therapy, reflexology or any more snake oil remedies that no insurance will pay for. Don't waste your money on this book."
3,too much for me,Book was a little too detailed for me. Took too long to read and lost interest even though I feel the Adams family was responsible for forming what we now have as a democracy. Both were very influential and adaptable to that changing era.
5,Cobalt SS Supercharged K&N Filter E-0777,"After reading mixed reviews about this product, I decided to try the filter in my car. After ordering the filter, I received the filter in 3 days. I installed the filter in about 5 minutes. After several weeks of driving to and from work, I have noticed that I am getting about 40 more miles to a tank of fuel. The stock air filter was like a giant bulk of paper and acted like a giant restrictor plug, and when it rained, my check engine light would come on until all the moisture left the road and the air. The check engine light has not come on one time since installation. The filter lets the sound of the supercharger be known. I am a true car guy, this product WORKS. Good luck with your K&N filter!"
2,Not a very good set of short stories.,"This book is a book of short stories involving Australians. Most of the stories were just plain boring to me. There were a couple that kept me from rating this a ""1."" My favorite story was ""Paul's Weaving."" It was about 2 people, a woman who valued silence and a man who valued the spoken word. He would not shut up, even when she dropped immense hints."
1,do not purchase,I did not receive the whole 3236 word document. I only got a 318 word 1 page document.
5,THE REMARKABLE PETER MARSHALL,"A MUST SEE FOR THE SKEPTIC AS WELL AS THE TRUE BELIEVER. PETER MARSHALL WAS NOT ONLY A REMARKABLE MINISTER TO HIS FLOCK, BUT A REMARKABLE MAN AS WELL. THE CAST IS OUTSTANDING IN THEIR PORTRYAL OF PETER & KATHERINE MARSHALL."
3,A Man Called Peter...,"The story of Peter Marshall, his life and work, this record of unequaled love and faith has brought inspiration to thousands, ""A glowingly Christian book."""
5,wonderful book,the price was excellent and the book arrived in time and fit the exact description as listed.I would recommend this to all.
4,Excellent read. Deep prospective.,"Rated ""4"" due to age of book. Content is rated ""5"". Condition of the book was excellent considering its age ""60"" and that it is out of print for so long.There were no pages missing or damaged and only stained by aging. I enjoyed every page of Catherine Marshall's well written account of Peter Marshall's ministry. A ministry truly worthy of emulating. People are lined up to read my copy including my daughter, a minister's wife. Thank you."
4,Great Story,"My wife and myself really enjoyed this movie. After telling my daughter about it, she purchased his books for me. After reading some of his sermons this movie meant more to me. I have shared this movie with my friends, they all enjoyed it."
4,nostalgia,"Of the 3 or 4 Deee-Lite singles off ""Dewdrops,"" this is the only one with a CD single, if I remember. The jungle mix of this song is on their ""Sampladelic Relics"" CD. I had a roommate who couldn't stand when I played this song because he thought all the phone-ringing and repetition of ""Call me! Call me!"" was annoying. I beg to differ. People who want to be called by potential paramours are demanding and repetitive. I love, just love Lady Miss Kier's speeches at the start and finish of this song. Wearing a feminist cap, you can say that she is empowered at the end by refusing the tardy come-ons of the ""caller."" I love the anime cover of the CD too. Deee-Lite can be viewed as ""uneven"": some of their stuff rocked, and some was junk. This was the former. I appreciated this joint so much back when I bought this joint in the mid-1990s."
2,The Glam Got Me In A Jam,"My daughter is very into David Bowie and the 70's glam rock scene. She's only 7 mind you but somehow she knows more than I do about the era and I was born in the 70's! So I wanted to buy her something (for her age group)to do with the 70's and glam rock for her birthday (she was born the same day as Nico, whoever that is). So I see the words ""Jam and Glam"" and I'm thinking ""Glam...""And it all seemed to fit together. Barbie is very appropriate for her age group. Needless to say, I was very pleased. Now, I know nothing about glam and I'm thinking that Glam Rock Theresa or whoever would be perfect. Boy was i all wrong. ""Mooooommmm!! They didn't wear pink warm up jackets in the 70's! Bowie and Nico wouldn't be caught dead in this!!!"" I 'm a failure, birthday is ruined. The name of the doll is totally misleading. Parents and shoppers beware: if you are in a similar situation, this doll is NOT your shopping solution. Oh and durability? I guess Theresa doesn't need two arms...."
3,Cheezy yet fun,"This movie is very cheesy. But if you don't set your expectations too high, it can also be a fun little bit o' entertainment if you're into medieval times. The production value is actually quite good, with the costumes and castles and such (I mostly rented this movie so that me and wife could more readily imagine the world of George RR Martin's ""A Song of Ice & Fire"" series.)The only character that is interesting and fun is the trusty comic-relief sidekick, Odo. If it wasn't for him, the movie would be very bad indeed. Ivanhoe and Rebecca elicit no empathy whatsoever.The special effects are pretty low-grade, but actually not too terrible. After watching this movie, you realize just how mind-bendingly awesome ""The Lord of the Rings"" movie is. LotR could easily have been as bad as Darkest Knight 2.A bad movie if you are expecting a good movie, but light-hearted and fun if you know what you're in for."
1,Better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick... maybe.,"I bought this on a whim, usually finding midieval dramas at least interesting. However, the acting quality, the cinematagraphy, and the plot soon reminded me of a cheesy 60s porno, but without the porn. There was never any character or plot development and you'll spend most of the time wondering what is going on. Basically, there is the evil prince john and the hero and a slew of other people, but you've got no idea what motivates the hero or prince john or anyone else for that matter. I've seen original highschool level productions with higher quality acting, plot, etc. than this movie. I cannot stress enough not to buy this. Please stop these people from acting and making more movies."
4,Good information - not my favorite writing,"This book is interesting, & I agree with the information presented. I like how the authors cite research studies to support their ideas/recommendations. I also found the information on how children learn math & reading very interesting.I read the book straight through over a couple of weeks & found it quite repetitive (I realize that the book is also meant to be read in segments). There are a couple of paragraphs in different chapters that are virtually identical. I also think the authors discouraged flash cards at least 20 times, which I found annoying."
3,"ok information, but title is a turn off for the educated parent",Einstein attributed his genius to learning to play the violin at the age of four. Learning is play!!!
1,Sucked,"I love the ""gentle revolution"" books and thought that I would get an opposing opinion from this book. The ""GV"" books tell you numerous times that all of the flash cards and other activities must be fun for the babies, else don't do them. Anyone who reads this book should also read some of the ""GV"" books to get another opinion. Good luck,"
1,still a worry book,"still a worry wart book advocating parents to do X Y and Z according to them and ""research."" The same research that shows putting a child in day care is fine. maybe it is. maybe play is great. maybe flash cards are great. to each their own"
1,Just right for lazy parents who do not want to be bothered with educating their child,"Not much to say here except if you are the type of parent that is looking for an excuse to not be bothered with educating your child, then this is the book for you. Given the dire state of our schools, where ""play "" is more the case than ""academics"", parents need help in preparing their child for school and life. Play is important, but when 43% of kids enter kindergarten and first grade not ready to learn, then the child and society pay a heavy price for play time over learning.Recommend, Gentry's Raising Confident Readers, a book that is simple with helpful instructions for parents who want their child ready for school and life.Raising Confident Readers: How to Teach Your Child to Read and Write--from Baby to Age 7"
3,ok,"I bought this as a first time mother. It had some good stuff in it. I enjoyed reading it. Would recommend this to a new mom. Since, I've had my second child and i'm not so concerned about every little thing."
1,False dichotomy,Why not do both? Memorization is an important skill in the real world. IT pros have to memorize loads of information and think creatively to succeed. Memorization is required to pass almost any license exam from driving to amateur radio. When my daughter fell behind in kindergarten because she had spinal surgery flashcards were the only way she could pass the 35 work sight reading test to be promoted to the first grade. Maybe some adults are projecting their own phobias about mnemonics onto their kids. Einstein never used flashcards but Einstein never had to deal with No Child Left Behind. Get real.
5,Very nice,can't go wrong with camelbak. This gets the weight off your shoulders and keeps the center of gravity low
5,Great pack for moderate length runs.,"I bought this in March 2008 and found it to be excellent for short to medium length runs (3-8 miles). As other reviews have indicated, the trick is in tigthening the belt, then pulling the side straps to tigthen it down particularly as you sip away.The storage pocket is excellent for cell phone, gel/GU, and the bright colors are great if you are running in any traffic. I would highly recommend again to anyone - and I'll be getting another one as mine grew ""legs"" after being set down for a few minutes."
4,not too bad,"I pretty much have the same comments as everyone else. I'm a man @ 5'10"" 180 pounds. I just bought this and ran 16 miles with it. Yes, at first it is bouncy so straps will need to be tightened. After a few good draws that no longer becomes an issue and there's still plenty of fluid left over. My run took 2 1/2 hours to complete and the water was still cold until the very end. It also has an extra pocket with plenty of storage space for things like a cell phone and keys. My only other complaint is that the clip that holds the hose in place is easy to loose if you want to drink on the go. Mine is gone. However tucking the hose in place is completely comfortable and unnoticeable, so problem solved. I take half a star away for the clip and another half star for the bounciness. After that, this is great for hydration on long distance runs."
5,Great purchase,"This camelbak was a life saver in the Black Rock desert. It's very easy and comfortable to carry, it contains enough water to go through the day, and has extra pockets to carry additional small, essential items. It's the perfect purchase for many great outdoor adventures."
3,I can't unscrew the water reservoir!!!!!,"I can't rate this product yet, looks great etc. BUT I CAN'T UNSCREW THE WATER RESERVOIR. ANY IDEAS?"
2,not practical for running....,too much bouncing up and down made this bag uncomfortable. i ended up dumping out all the water during my 1/2 marathon. i wanted to carry it by the end of the race. i also couldn't get it to stay tight! which was a huge pain b/c i was contantly pulling at the straps to try and make it tighter. not impressed at all. i actually want my money back if they will take back one that has been used once.
5,I love Dick Clark!,"Dick Clark has had to spend his life being associated with a television personality of the same name. That he has survived this daily irritation is a testament to his grace. He is definitely San Francisco's most beloved pianist, and has played music at many of the significant events of my life and the lives of those closest to me. I associate him with lovely evenings: men in black tie, beautiful women, champagne and candlelight. All of his CDs are perfect for putting on right before you open the door for the first guests. But I also play them when I'm working on a project. His musicality somehow creates the perfect mental space in which to work, and gives even the most drudgery-filled day a little sparkle."
1,Poor Quality,"I regret very much that this product was of very poor quality. While the shipper pledged a refund, I have not confirmed this as yet, and he pledged this more than a week ago.I will never buy from this company again, I am sorry to say, because the product was very poor in quality, and I felt cheated. I would not recommend this Vendor to my friends."
4,Very nice,"Joe Sample just released a new version of ""When your Life was Low"" but Randy Crawford's soulful singing of it is far superior, as is the Fender Rhodes work of Sample here. The CD is worth the price for this one cut.....the song is getting a lot of airplay now (9-99) but this LP is well worth listening to... what a voice.."
2,Problems playing from PC,"the mixer does not have a way to connect to a pc unless you disconnect the CD players and use the numark DJ IO, not worth the hassle got rid of it and purchased a Numark MixPro"
4,Numark Fusion 111,This was a gift for my husband and it has made him very happy. The product arrived well packed which impressed my husband (he's a shipping manager).
3,It's well made and the grip was comfortable. ...,It's well made and the grip was comfortable. But it didn't get a good hold on fine hairs.
2,Disappointed,I was very disappointed in this video. It appears that a few scenes were cut from the one that I saw basc in the 90'S Please inform the seller of this?
4,worthwhile addition,"These tapes are a very worthwhile addition and follow on from the 2 nine dragon books. The production is good quality, clearly presented and easy to understand. As you progress through the tape series more of the information and fundamentals become clearer. A DVD version would make things easier to review and return straight to specific spots. It would be difficult to get the true picture of the art without the books."
5,Good size and well made....,Very sturdy.. note the size.. it's not huge..I'd say it's a good size for 4-6 people...or two very greedy people. One thing I want to add is that I'm a bit disappointed to see that the price has been doubled.. why? Let me guess.. Valentine's Day is next month - that's not cool. I bought this here at Amazon for $8.99 but it was in August. I bet if you wait until after Feb 14th the price will go back down.
5,very nice for price,I purchased this for a french dessert. It also could be used for rinsing berries. Place the berries in the bowl and rinse them under running water. The water will drain from the holes.
1,Missed Opportunity,"There are interviews in the book of people such as Dr. Weil, Geneen Roth (Woman Food and God), and others. You would think there would be some substance, some value, some insight this book wuuld have provided. Based on the PBS show I expected so much. The book is not even a 1 star rating.Example the interview with Dr. Weil is two pages. The questions are superficial so his answers are just some high level talk about stress. The interview with Geneen Roth again two pages, she talks about how much weight she lost over the years, and that when she was thin she still was not happy. That was it, but it was because of the questions being asked. This book could have focused on a handful of people but instead it is a rushed 2 page interview of many people and nothing of value. I bought this used for 1 cent on Amazon and I paid too much."
3,Good Reference Book,I have used this book in my reading classes for graduates. It has become an excellent tool in my classroom as well. I have lent it to several teachers to use when questions concerning phonics or methods arrive. It's an excellent resource book to keep close at hand in the classroom.
3,Teaching Reading: In Today's Elementary Schools (Ninth Edition),Like new condition. Only a few highlights.
4,Easy to follow,Keiko Murakumo's qigon movement is a little bit faster than other popular instructors. I like the speed of her movement and I can easily follow her just by watching Full Session Facing Mirror. I also like the music of Full Session No1~No14. But I wish I could have another Full Session with voice explanation.
5,Great lower body workout with great results!!,"This is an excellent lower body workout!! One of the great things about this workout is that it is all floor exercises! By adding dumbbells and ankle weight, you will maximize your results> I like this alot better than lunges and squats over and over. If you are serious about firming the lower body, this tape is all you need."
2,only for W fanatics,"Ah, I was hoping for some deeper insight. You get a taste of some of W's thinking, and on a human note you will gain some understanding of what his life was like near the end, but the philosophical conversations are too fragmentary to stand on their own and give minimal stuff to think upon. Perhaps if you really know W's later work so you can match a conversation to some published thought then these might add something. If Bouwsma had provided such connections or commentary the book might be more instructive but he seems to be reluctant to add much beyond just reporting the synopsis of the conversations and W's actions. I was mistaken to expect the book to be something to help begin with W."
2,Not so bongo for First Act bongos,"I'm a musician, so my expectations going into the transaction were fairly low; however, my knowledge of First Act as a decent manufacturer led me down the path of hope. Um, yeah ... I think these bongos are more of a Last Act. While the wood construction seems pretty solid, the bongo heads were really bad. And given that these are often given to children, it would be nice to have removable ""feet,"" which would allow small children to set them on a table or the floor and still get some sort of resonance.If you just want something for the kids to bang on, they're fine. But if you harbor any hope of your child being inspired to create music, spend the dough and get entry-level ""real"" bongos."
3,top is made of paper?,"you need to hold the bongos up in order for the sound to resonate. a bit difficult for a 2 1/2 year old. however, sound is decent even though the tops are made of what seems like cardboard. our son loves to ""drum"" every thing he sees. but he stopped playing with these after a few minutes. maybe in another 6mo to a year he'll enjoy them."
3,I Hope You're a Fan of Christian Comedy!,"I didn't hate this but it wasn't as exciting as I expected to be. I had seen Chocolate and Small Frie before and I knew they were funny, so I was expecting this to be pretty good, too. It was just alright. There were funny moments though. Chocolate was real funny as I expected her to be; Small Frie recycled jokes she used on BET Comic View; and the guys weren't funny at all...to me!Oh and the audio was off on the DVD.I bought this for $7 at Walmart."
3,I thought Chucky was the funniest,The other comedians weren't as funny in my opinion. But it was a good try . .. .
2,The Kingdom Comedy Tour AKA Hilarious Sanits of Comedy,"I Love my brother and sister in Christ and unless we just want to support them; that is fine, but the comedy was not funny, plain and simple."
2,Don't judge this book by its cover!,"The best picture is on the cover (courtesy of e.t. archive, London).There's nothing new here: all the pictures are reproduced from various photo archives. Quite a few photos are out-of-focus and/or over-exposed.If you're looking for really good pictures that have been newly photographed see those by Araldo De Luca in ""The Valley of the Kings"" - edited by Kent R. Weeks (ISBN 1-58663-295-7) and ""Tutankhamun"" - text by T. G. H. James (ISBN 1-58663-032-6).The Hagens' book is divided into 15 thematic chapters (such as ""Survival Techniques - Mummies"" and ""Tomb Robbers and Curses"") - each opening with a metallic gold page which shows up finger marks. The text is comparable to that of a voice-over in a television documentary.This one is for the mass tourist market."
4,Ancient Egypt,"Excellent survey of ancient Egyptian history, culture and artwork with superlative photographs and informative, insightful text."
3,Very loosely based on Peter Mayle's fabulous book,"If you are looking for a series faithful to Peter Mayle's wonderful book then you may like to pass on this.Very few books are well adapted to TV or movies for that matter. Peter Mayle's absorbing and hilarious tale of his first year in Provence has indeed suffered in the process.Unnecessarily exaggerated characters and garbled and completely new storylines, while mildly amusing, weren't a patch on the original stories.The french characters frequently lapsed into french without the benefit of subtitles which only added to my dissatisfaction.And though I have always enjoyed John Thaw in his many and varied roles I couldn't quite see him as Peter Mayle.The whole thing seemed remarkably stilted and overdone to me.The book was outstanding, the audio book was thoroughly enjoyable but the dvd, well, I was very disappointed.If you haven't read the book, you might enjoy it more. And it did have nice scenery."
3,a little disappointing,"I was very disappointed because I now live in France and can't play the DVDs on my new Sony BluRay/DVD player. However I can play them on my laptop computer, so all is not lost, except they would be terrific on my plasma TV. I would like to buy more DVDs, but I am a little sceptical. Any suggestions?"
4,Do you want to move to France?,"I bought this without ever having heard of it before. I really love some of the older British series, like All Creatures Great and Small, and The Irish R.M., so I thought I would try this one. It was worth it. If you have ever wondered what it would be like to move to another country, without being able to speak the language very well, this will give you a little insight. The show is slower paced, which doesn't appeal to everyone; but it has some good comedy at times, and made me wish I lived in a less hectic world like in this show. One of the best things I liked about it was how you could understand the basics of what a person was saying in French, without understanding a word of it. Sometimes some basic words would be said in English by the English actors, other times it was a matter of figuring it out. This is a great program to watch when you just want to sit and relax for a little while. It is divided into 30 minute segments, one for each month of the year."
4,A Delight in Provence,"Except for the title and the two main characters, A Year in Provence is nothing like the book. But put that aside and take it for what it is, a delightful look at adopting a place and its people. It's a story that makes you laugh at the different and sometimes smelly people in this small town. And it will touch you when they open their hearts to the Brits. The hacking in combining the French & English languages is truely outrageous, and make sure you listen to the way the Parisian pronounce the word house. Salute & enjoy!"
2,Very disapointed,I highly anticipated this being a great film and story. Too difficult to follow. Would not recommend. Lots of other wine movies to choose from.
3,Several scenes missing,"I was quite disappointed in the DVD version of A Year in Provence. I had owned the VHS edition (which needed to be replaced because of its longevity), and I was quite taken aback when I found that SEVERAL scenes had been cut in the DVD that HAD been included in the VHS edition. Be careful when buying the DVD if you enjoyed the VHS in its original form.....This is one of my favorite movies, so, needless to say, I was VERY DISAPPOINTED to find the omissions."
2,like a sleeping pill,"i've read all of peter's non-fiction books and had high hopes for the movie, bt it was slow and dull...if you need something to help you fall asleep, this might be the trick...."
1,Don't buy this dvd!,"The movie totally misses the feel of the book which is upbeat and funny. They have Peter Mayle and his wife arguing and complaining the entire time. She even talks about cutting up the unwanted guest into a hundred pieces and putting him in the trash. Not quite the humor I was hoping for. The book protrays Peter Mayle as enjoying Provence and the characters he meets there. He acts like a angry, grumpy old man in the movie. The DVD even makes up story lines that weren't in the book. Plus, I hoped to see some of the countryside of France but there is hardly any shown. My husband and I couldn't even finish watching it because it was so bad and disappointing."
2,Predictable,"There is a formula to this film, and once you catch on boredom sets in. It's about an English couple that retired to Provence. They barely know any French and stumble into awkward situations with locals. The advertising executive (Thaw) and his pretty, shrewish wife know virtually nothing of the 200-year-old house they purchased and didn't even do research on the weather. Ultimately, however, things work out and everyone gets drunk. That's about it. No humor, no adventure, lots of bickering and rolling of eyes. John Thaw is utterly wasted. I'm tossing my copy; I wouldn't inflict this on anyone."
2,Very disappointing!,Not nearly what I expected when I got it. The scenery is ok. Its not funny at all and the characters seem very unpleasant and uptight. Its also very long and drawn out. I would recommend the book over the video.
1,A year in Provence,It took too long to get here.The quality of the reproduction is not up to a professional standard as it has poor colour and definition.Very disapointing we expected it would be much better.I will not be ordering VHS tapes from Amazon again.
5,Year in Provence,Very true to the books by Peter Mayle - John Thaw is excellent. When locals speak French there are no subtitles and things are not always translated so you have a sense of tyhe the Mayles are going through.Very droll look at trying to settle in to a new foreign cultureEach season is 1 1/2 hours so great value for money
3,TRES CHARMANT!,"This DVD is loosely based on Peter Mayle's books starting with ""A Year in Provence"". I have read some of his books and it was interesting to compare the characters and the stories. It seems that the characters in the DVD are somewhat exaggerated and many of the stories do not even derive from Peter Mayle's books. I also noticed that for some reason, Peter Mayle wife's name was changed. I loved seeing the Provencal scenery. I have visited this beautiful region and it's intoxicating. Although this DVD is in English, I felt that there were too many instances where certain characters would only speak in French (with no subtitles) leaving the viewer wondering what exactly they were saying. Although I know some French, I was lost once they started speaking fast. But regardless, it's very entertaining and a great value purchased on Amazon."
5,"Love the French, its easy","Hey, you have heard all the stories of the French...well, perhaps you will see some of that in this movie, but, you are going to understand the French a bit more after watching this wonderful movie. I have watched it many times over and find it keeps calling me back when I want to escape to some place better than where I am. Lean back on your favorite sofa, pour a glass of wine, cut some good bread and feed your brain and senses with this one. What a wonderful delight to see and experience a different, and somewhat slower pace to life."
4,Light enjoyable chance to live vicariously in France,"This is light entertainment that can take you away from your own life for awhile. Its very well written and acted. John Thaw is wonderful as Peter Mayles and he captures the spirit of the book.However, if you are one of those people who insist on a very literal interpretation of the book, you may find fault with this dramatization. ""A Year in Provence"" was a small book and this DVD is four episodes in length. There is a lot of added material, but its very much in the style of Mayles' book. While I enjoyed the book very much, I found the DVD to be just as much fun with the added bonus of the scenery of Provence.When we finished watching this DVD, we missed being in Provence with the characters in the story. A warning to potential viewers- you will find yourself on the computer perusing property for sale in Provence when you've finished watching it!"
4,A Year of Amusement!,"THis film is alot of fun and though some of it is in French and a mixture of French and English-it only increases the humor as the characters continue to misunderstand each other. The ending teaches us that we can all come together in mutual understanding, in spite of our differences!"
5,The Best John Thaw Ever!,The is the cream of the crop when it boils down to the very best of Provence This is a beginning to end viewing. John Thaw. Lindsay Duncan and Provence at their best!
5,Another Great BBC Series.,"We watched and enjoyed this series over a decade ago and bought the VHS tape. We lent it out never to see it again. Just glad to have it back now on DVD. Peter Mayle has written a few books since this series, but I think this is his best. He even wrote the script for the film ""A Good Year"" based on this series. The characters in the series are very memorable and it doesn't hurt a bit to know a little French to help you understand the minor sub-plots that are introduced into the story line. All in all very enjoyable."
4,Is Something Missing?,I thoroughly enjoyed this series(VHS format) but the DVD version seems to be missing some scenes.Has anyone else noticed this or is it my imagination?
4,"Fun for some, but poor-quality DVD","I've been revisiting this wonderful mini-series on DVD, watching it on a hi-res screen, and note that the image-quality is really appalling. It looks like they took an old VHS tape, and strained it through a sieve. Which is probably pretty close to what actually happened, the ""sieve"" in this case being a really crude digital-compression system. Too bad, because it contains a lot of beautiful scenic photography, which has been turned to mush.Update: since I wrote this, I learned that many if not most British TV programs were filmed using 16mm cameras to cut production costs. Almost all US television shows and movies are filmed using 35mm, which contains roughly 4 times the detail of 16mm. Also the 16mm film stock they were using at the time often wasn't that great. This wasn't very noticeable on the TVs then. What this means is that these DVDs may have the best picture that will ever be available."
3,"good, but nothing new","It's a good book, but only if you are very new to wicca or witchcraft. It has a lot of things rehashed from other writers and it's not in the most easy-to-read format, but it is still a nice book."
5,"nice book, intelligent workmanship",I think that it has alot of begginer material. and alot about the herb craft.
3,Presents little new Information,I felt this book really was about rituals and rules more than herbs and green magic. Yes it is a great book for a the green witch but for other wiccans its basically the average book.
4,Suprising and Educational,"I had no idea what to expect from this book, but was pleasantly surprised about how well the author explains the traditions and connects them to the Christian experience. It is very interesting and eye-opening. Anyone with a negative view of witchcraft should read this to learn how similar celebrations are and how this truly is more of a religion than a cult. In addition, their use of natural things, herbs, trees, etc. is remarkable and wonderful. I believe in God and consider myself a christian, but I am open minded enough to appreciate people are different but similar at the same time. The book is worth reading no matter what 'religion' you are. It gives lots of details and explains things in a way any lay person could understand. Wiccan is not evil, but has roots and a belief system that is easy to understand and follow. From what I've read so far (not finished) I can see why people would turn to Wiccan if disappointed or dissatisfied with their chosen religious path."
5,Very good book for the beginner AND advanced,"This book is a very good book for those seeking to learn of witchcraft, or divination, or spellcasting. Doesn't have much faery lore, but it does have very thourough things on herbs, runes, the Tarot. It also has spells for healing, prosperity, and protection. It is a very good book. :)"
5,By Far the Best Book I've Read in Regard to Witchcraft....,"This book is an absolute ""Must Read""! Myself being a Witch, not a Wiccan (yes, there is a difference), I have read countless books on the Craft over the past 10 years. Although many of these books were quite interesting and offered great insight, needless to say something was missing. When I came across Green Witchcraft, I literally jumped for joy! I had finally found ""The Book"" or shall I say, ""Books"". Green Witchcraft, Green Witchcraft- part II, and the Manual, along with Grimoire for the Green Witch are indispensable! Page 75 & 76 truly hits the nail on the head...But, I won't give it away! Set aside a weekend for yourself. Curl up in your favorite chair and read this book! Brightest Blessings.... )O("
3,Not Family Traditional Witchcraft,"This book has little to nothing to do with actual family traditional Witchcraft beyond the incorporation of the stang and wreath - and that's as far as it goes (which isn't very far). Although this book tends to fair better than alot of the Llewellyn tripe out there, it is still eclectic Wicca that has been dressed up a little. If you are looking for information on traditional Witchcraft, try a book such as Nigel Aldcroft Jackson's ""Call of the Horned Piper."""
4,Interesting,"Aoumiel does indeed offer a lot of information in her book regarding colors for holidays, living as a green witch, and so forth, but her views on witch history are indeed biased. One should take a history class on the subject or at least thumb through a few texts before reading this section, as it is possible to get a warped vision of the past if the only information given is the opinionated section in the back of her book. Other than the definitely overboard indignance on the part of the witches, Aoumiel's book is a treasure. Bright blessings."
5,By far my favorite,"As I've been reading through the reviews, I've notice that some people seem to be attacking the way Aoumiel writes or how she explains her religion. I personally identify with this book a great deal, and the books that follow this one. The only think I have to say is, if you are looking for a book that generalizes wicca and doesn't reflect the authors belief, this book is not for you. If you want to get a deeper look into a personal view of witchcraft, I suggest this book 100%. I enjoy hearing the history she talks about, how her grandmother and mother were Catholic and I enjoyed Aoumiel's description and love for 'her' side of witchcraft. All around a great book."
2,To much history not any green,If you are looking for a book on being a green witch this book is not for you. Buy The Way of the Green Witch By Arin Murphy-Hiscock if you want to learn about green witchcraft. If you want to learn about the history of witchcraft buy Green Witchcraft. Most of the book is the author rambling along about the history of witchcraft and repeating herself alot. I have no idea what tarot reading has to do with being a green witch. Green witchcraft is not about ceremonies or casting circles or reading tarot cards. It is about nature. Planting flowers and herbs and veggie gardens. Tending nature. Trees and flowers and animals and getting in touch with them. This is just about witchcraft. So in that case I suggest you read Scott Cunningham. I am glad I only paid $1.20 for this book. Really where is the Fairylore and the info on herbs is really sketchy. The book has some pretty illustrations but that's about it. This is just my opinion so feel free to read it and form your own.
5,Great Intro for Those Interested in This Path,"This is one of the few books on the craft that I actually read all the way through. I was always interested in the natural, herbal side of witchcraft and this book provided me with a lot of great, readable (honestly, some of these type of books can really make your head spin) information at an affordable price. My only riff...where is the fairy lore like it says in the title? There was only a tiny bit of info on fairy lore, definitely not enough to earn a spot in the title. But still, if you have an interested in nature and magick, this is for you. Thanks for readin!"
2,An infant could use it! A child probably wrote it.,"This book is so for beginners, I would say it's for small children. It contains mostly all fluffy-bunny type material, suitable for kindergarteners. The ""Craft history"" presented in it is questionable, to say the least; and one could say, completely inaccurate... to... imagined. The rituals are extremely long, with ""simple"" purifications that could last over an hour, with only a few seconds for the actual rite, or verse for the celebration. I guess one has to fill a book up with something, right? The useful part of the book is it's cover, which has the refreshingly green picture; but one should have simply bought a picture of a green forest, instead. Otherwise, for sure, it does a fair job of offending Christians out there, of which, however, humans don't need more inaccuracy and misunderstanding in the world."
3,good,"I enjoyed this book. I'm still in the middle of reading it, and I think it's pretty good so far. It is definitely a book for beginners. She certainly doesn't beat around the bush. Her respect for green witchcraft is obvious. One thing I didn't like so much is that she speaks very much from a Shiva god point of view (for lack of better description on my part)and it seemed like she simply dismissed the Egyptian gods and goddesses except Bast. Isis is the goddess I turn to, and when I saw how little she spoke of Egyptian deities, I could not help feeling a little offended. But that is just my own subjective opinion of course. I also found myself skipping over a lot of the parts where she talks about her own stories. Despite all that, I think Moura is a good teacher, and presents the information in a very clear and concise way."
3,A basic book for the beginner.,"The book covers much of the basic material needed to get started. The author also adds her personal touch with spells and rituals that she finds useful. Though there is little ""old history"" of Green Witchcraft here, it is well written, and very positive toward Witchcraft."
4,Green Witchcraft one of the better Craft books,"As an author of Craft books myself, I found Green Witchcraft to be a nice change from the standard fare out there. While I don't agree with everything in the book, Ann Moura has managed to present a very interesting and eclectic look at the Craft, and that is most welcome. She casts off the notion that Wiccan tradition need be dogmatic, and opens up the concept of Witchcraft for those who, like me, prefer a less-dogmatic approach."
4,Great History Lesson for Beginners,"If your looking for a book that teaches the history and relevance of Witchcraft and the World in terms of the ideals, ethics and values of the HedgeWitch look no further this is a great book. Great for beginners if you already know your redes, circle castings, deities, and reasons why your practicing the Craft this book is too basic. But if you want to learn about Runes, Candles, Oghams, Tarots, Herbs, Crystals etc.. A great guide!"
5,Green Witchcraft,Love this book its defiantly more for people just starting in witchcraft but is a good review for others in the craft. She dose spend alot of time talking about other religions and there beliefs as a way to help you understand where she is coming form on her views.But over all this book is satisfactory.
3,A very good book,"Yet it falls short of my expectations. Although it sure has lots of nifty information and new ideas, it does not live to it's description as a True Beginner's Guide to the Old Religion. Actually, this title quite contradicts what she writes. She is actually writing about witchcraft as a practice as opposed to wicca the religion. Therefore, it will add greater confusion to anyone who would like to follow witchcraft or wicca for they will not be able to distinguish what is what. She also forgot to mention the specifics of the tools, although she clearly mentions the names Athame, Wand and other tools.All in all, it is a very good book if you are already an experienced practitioner. But for newbies, stick to Cunningham!"
5,Gran Cubano de la M√∫sica!,Cachao es el mejor m√∫sico cubano que jam√°s he vivido! Todas sus grabaciones son excelentes!
3,Medium Beige concealer,"The product is good, it is not that sticky but it is A bit lighter than it is but not bad at all."
4,GOOD SET BUY IF YOU WHAT,THIS IS A COOL SET AND HAS A COOL DRAGONS AND SOME GUYS AND A KRYSTAL THIS SET IS NOT THAT GREAT.I ADD THIS SET TO MY VORGAN STRONGHOLD AND IT MADE IT BATTER BECAUSE NOW THEIR ARE THREE DRAGONS AND TONS OF GUYS AND NOW YOU CAN STAGE A GREAT BATTLE SO I SAY BUY IT IF YOU ARE A BIG FAN OF THE DRAGON SERRIES LIKE ME.
5,A lost classic.,"A great punk/new wave album. Nothing else Naked Raygun did remotely measures up to this; the reason, so far as I can tell, is that here they had the benefit of a bass-and-drum combo that was very distinctive and that they lost afterwards (it also can be heard on Basement Screams). Rat Patrol, Leeches, and Libido are examples; they never got that sound back again. It sure was fun while it lasted."
5,Don't listen to the negative reviews!,"I have been in love with Jessica Simpson since she first arrived on the scene in 1999. She Gets Better every song she makes. Yes The Video has a lot more raunchy stuff in it but its amazing. She worked hard for that body, so she should show it off like that. If you are a New or Old Jessica Simpson fan get this, you won't regret it."
2,christina?,"I think this song is o.k.. it only seemed to be popular because of the video.I also think Jessica and her parents are hypocrites, they bashed Christina Aguilera about what she wore or did not wear, but then jessica comes out half naked in the video for this song. jessica said that she was trying to portray the spirit of the movie!!!!!.what a lame reason, and the only reason right??????????."
4,Nice relaxing music,"Somehow and got addicted to the sound of the Piano that Keiko Matsui plays. Even though my favorite CDs are ""Full Moon and The Shrine"" and ""Moon Walk"" I found Cherry Blossom is pleasant to listen to, especially tracks 1,4,6 and 7. It may be more appriciated if I had a chance to experience Cherry Blossom season in Japan.I am not sure what type/genre of this music is and dont really care. Piano/Sax of Matsui's product is what I am enjoying. Happy listening."
4,Excellent Movie,If you like suspense right up to the end then this is a movie for you. The French subtitles are a little fast but otherwise a good rental.
1,wasted $$,It's subtitled rather than dubbed. Christie should be left to the Brits to dramatize because the Americans and French over-act and destroy exceptional mysteries.
5,"really good routine, bar workout is very intense","i bought a body bar and video this year and really didn't like the instructor Kelly Roberts, especially after reading that she is unhelathy(belimic, anerexic), plus the video was boring. I then saw Leisa Hart's new Fit To The Core videos and tried them since I love all of her other stuff, and I loved it. I can use my bar, but I am going to buy her CORE BAR and test drive it. This video is video straight forward, toning the upper body and firming up the problem areas of the butt and thighs, the BURN video is also great."
2,kinda weak,"You would have to use some serious weights to get a real impact from this video. I watch it only on my really unmotivated days when I dont want to work out, just to feel like I did something."
4,Takes a couple times to get used to...,"I love leisa hart videos - I started when I was pregnant with her FitMama Prenatal video and loved it so much I bought the Fitmama Postnatal workout. And both kept me in great shape during and after my pregnancy! Now that I need a more challenging workout I've gotten this video and I LOVE it. I dont have the core bar so I can't comment on that, but I would like to get one. Right now I'm just using dumbbells and that's fine too. The choreography is really great and really gets you working - However, it takes a bit of learning. The cues come fast and I felt a little clumsy the first two or three times I did it, but now I can keep up. I feel SOOO good after doing her videos. She's a great fitness personality - not at all like some of those other annoying trainers in home fitness videos!!"
2,A let down!,"I don't know what they were thinking when this video was edited. I saw this when it first appeared on television and loved it. But the best parts are cut out! A real disappointment. I don't recommend the edited version. Go for the unedited, it was great."
4,A wonderful journey,"This excellent adaptation of the legendary story is actually much more likeable than the original story -- and it actually makes much more sense. The FX were incredible, but what realy drives the story is the chemistry between Avital and Scott, especially given the *incredible* job done by the latter in not just one, but two roles. While I think ABC could have done with a 3-part story instead of 2, which would have given us more interaction between the two principal characters, that is the *only* real complaint I have. Ask anyone who knows me -- that is an unusual compliment. A definite buy!"
4,Arabian Nights,"A really Cool Movie. Initially before watching, I had the impression that TV movies were not that great.... I was wrong. It had great CGI effects, story line and theme. Yes, TV movies cannot compete with Big Screen in budget.. but with Cable bills rising... more people are staying at home.This movie was nice."
2,BORING,"This has got to be one of the most awful made for T.V. Mini-Series since the remake of Stephen King's The Shining. I haven't had so much trouble staying awake watching a movie as I did trying to watch this and comprehend what it's suppose to be about. The story lines were inept and childlike. Most of the visual effects were rather stunning, but on the whole, the special effects don't make up for the boring and all too lame story lines. I don't think my watching this story again or even wasting my time and money to buy it is what I would ever do. This is a classic Failure which should have been left on the cutting room floor. If you have trouble sleeping at night, I suggest buying this video and trying to watch it, you will soon be sleeping like a baby."
2,Disappointment,"I watched Arabian Nights on television and I loved it. I loved everything about it: the storyline, the acting, the scenery, the costumes, everything. I was so looking forward to getting this video. I was so disappointed when I realized that the editors of this movie cut out crucial scenes that were inclued in the televised movie. It's basically a choppy mess. Some of the edited out portions were subtle but I knew where the cuts were. A good movie should flow smoothly. For example, the story about Amin the beggar and Abrashield were entirely cut out. That's a crucial part of the movie. It's when the sultan realizes what his brother is doing to him. Without that part, the scene doesn't make sense. Two stars for this video, no stars for the editor."
5,"Absolutely wonderful, unless you get the CUT version!","This is an absolutely wonderful movie! We watched it as a family and loved it! Dougray Scott is an amazing actor and very believable as the Sultan going mad. I received this video as a present and my 8 year old daughter pointed out that huge parts of it were cut out! The tale of the beggar and sultan, a huge turning point in the story was gone, among other parts! It didn't make sense! And my husband had ordered the extended play version. We finally rented it and saw it in its entirety. If you watch it make sure you get the full version...it is 175 minutes long. The cut version is 139 minutes long and really takes away from the story. The story is nothing without the crucial parts cut out. I highly recommend the extended play version and feel you are really missing out if you don't watch it at least once!"
4,Much better than I expected,Arabian Nights was an entertaining adaptation of The 1001 Arabian Nights. I showed it to my junior and senior world lit classes and it held them and kept them awake. As it is a tv mini-series it is rather long but it was worth it to watch the entire film. John Leguizamo (sic?) as the Genie was the highlight of the movie. The story of the character Bac Bac was humorous although it was a little politically insensitive.
4,Fun Movie,"We saw this first on the SciFi channel and sat mesmerized for the entire 3+ hours. The next day I ordered the DVD and we've watched it twice already!Storytelling is an art, and this is a masterpiece! I would highly recommend to anyone!"
5,Excellent,"This is one of the best investments in DVDs. For the new generation, it is a good way to get a glimpse of the rich heritage of stories told over generations. I would recommend it 100%."
5,Well Done,There's something for everyone in this movie with its many different facits. It simply was a fun movie to watch.
3,"I have no idea if the book is any good, but...","This is actually more of a review of the review by ""Ann"" (below this one). I am a little suspicious of it since she abbreviates the University of Virginia as ""U of V"" instead of what everybody calls it, which is ""UVA."" Also if you check out all of ""Ann's"" reviews, she only rates books in the College Prowler series and gives them all 5 stars.I'm just saying."
5,It's not for everyone but definitely for me!,"I first heard this band and their song ""All falls away"" on a University of Alabama College Radio Station in 1988. If it makes any difference, that song has not left my mind and through research I've found it and am ordering it on Amazon ten years later. The song left a wonderful impression on me and if you like violin trenched folk guitar with a grass root non commercialized feel, you will surely like it too!"
5,neglected 80s gem,"This album was an fine 1980s example of Alt-Country or Americana, or whatever you want to call that blend of rock and folk and country influences. The leader of the Silos, Walter Salas-Humara, was a fine guitar player and an even better songwriter. There are many gems on this album, tunes that stick with you and reverberate. If you liked quality 80s alt-guitar bands such as R.E.M, the dBs, Reivers, or more recent acts like the Jayhawks or Wilco, do yourself a favor and listen to the Silos, especially this album. It remains a neglected classic of the era."
4,Good Introduction,"This book is very good introductory book for using Dynamic HTML features. Assume knowledge of HTML. Good for students and programmers going for advance web programming. Explains various tools, styles and other features necessary. Illustrative examples and excerises."
1,Don't even think about buying this book,"This book is not worth spending much money on. It gives you examples but does not explain how they work. In some case, it has you change small bits of code, making nice-looking pages, but leaves complicated functions behind and unexplained.NOT VERY HELPFUL"
1,garbage,nothing but trouble speco is a terrible company to do bussiness with they refused to stand behind their product gave the excuse that amason is not an authorized seller so therefofe they would not honor the warranty come on give me a break amason is great though they gave me a complete refund
2,Not a Shu Qi flic,"I collect movies of the beautiful Shu Qi.. This is soft core,somewhat dicey for age insinuation,and Shu Qi does not appear other than as a prequel and sequel narrator.Sexy enough movie, but not a good buy for a Shu Qi fan."
2,This is a strenge type - III movie.,This is a Type - III (HK's rating for X or NC-17). This story is about a 8 years girl who want to be grown up so her and her friend wish at the wishing tree to be grown up and the next morning she finds herself with a body of an 18 year girl and the mind of an 8 year old still. So set out to learn about the world and along the way she falls and love and gets hurt and wishes to turn back it to an 8 year girl only to change her mind and whats to turn back into an 18 y/o but it is too late because shortly after her last wish the tree burns down so she can't turn back. There is a surpise at the end that yu will have to see for yourself to believe. The Type - III is for the sex scenes in the movie. (I have the DVD form.)
2,cute,"it is a very naieve look at a young asian girl coming of age. not well made, but cute if you like assian women"
2,GREECE ??? - FIRST USE IN HISTORY AFTER 1850 A.C.,WE MOST BE VERY CAREFULL. USING THIS WORD MEANS THAT GREECE IS VERY OLD STATE WHICH IS NOT. MACEDONIA STILL EXSIST FOR OPOSITE OF HELLENIC CITY-STATES . AND SO WE MUST MAKE A DIFFERENCE BEATWEAN THOSE NATIONS - MACEDOINAN AND HELENIC
2,Late,Item missed Christmas despite having ample time (and I paid for expedited shipping). Store was very specific about shipping times and did not live up to those times. Very disappointing.
5,Great Book,This is a great book of essays & beautiful pictures. I purchased it as a gift & the recipient loves it. I just which I could have gotten vol. I as well.
5,Excellent Multipurpose knife I use every day!,Just the right length and shape to use for a multitude of tasks in the kitchen. Nice blade that looks like I can easily keep it sharp! Great quality for an affordable price.
5,My Best Choice,"Finally had to replace my old (15+ years) Epson dot matrix printer. I purchased this model for function and price. I only print my personal checks on it so I expect it to last another 15 years. Set up was easy and printing is super fast. Works great, looks great and not too big a footprint."
4,"Great light, for the money!","I have (and use) this light, (for about 3 years now) and it has proven to be verygood. I live in an urban area, where the street lights are so bright, I almostdon't even NEED a headlight. STILL, I have a habit of going from well-lit urban streets, to completely un-lit trails, woods, and general off-roading.(I have a men's 26"" ""Mongoose Spark"") This light is bright enough for ANY/ALL of the areas I go to. It also seems tough enough to take this. I also consider it very durable, after I wrecked, and it fell off my bike, then skidded down a paved road, for about 20 feet. Afterwards, I just clipped it back in place, and it worked fine! Since I don't do to much biking in the rain, I don't know how waterproof it may (or may NOT) be, and it has no blinking settings, as well as being just Halogen, and NOT LED (or Light Emitting Diode). Still, it's VERY reliable, durable, and bright! (just not LED)"
2,"Good light, but battery hog","This light works well, lights up a lot of the road in front, and makes me visible to cars, but it goes through batteries way faster than I ever expected. I had this light for about one month before I decided to replace it, and in that time I went through four sets of its four AA batteries. That's expensive. I've since purchased a Planet Bike 5 LED Beamer light and am very happy with it. The area it illuminates is not as big as this light's area, but it's brighter, has a blink mode, uses only 2 AA batteries, and I've had it now for 2 weeks and haven't had to replace the batteries."
3,Eh....,This is a good product in theory. In practice not so much. If you set it to a distance that would be useful to see ahead it's a bit too weak. I also can't get the thing to stay where I want it. It doesn't tighten down enough. It does help you see pedestrians in dark clothing before you run them over and cars can see you a lot better. Just don't expect it to light your way.
5,Not Your Grandfather's Rockabilly,"This is not the greatest CD in terms of production values. There is more hiss than you would probably like but I think that is due to the general obscurity of the source material. It seems to be previously unreleased demo tapes from the 1960s. Nevertheless, if you like your rockabilly with a weird edge, you need to hear this. I can't really describe it other than to say that it sounds like Jim Morrison doing rockabilly. Also the last track is worth the price alone."
5,Friend of the band,"Argueably the sound that would become grunge was born not in Seattle but in Louisville, KY by Squirrel Bait. This band was once quoted as Bob Mould's favorite in Rolling Stone. The raw energy is unsurpassed in any album I've ever heard. This band was the NEW ROCK.I knew these guys well and helped setup shows (once with Husker Du). That aside the album rocks. One band member went on to Slint, one to Love Jones, one to Big Wheel, and two formed Bastro. The creativity found in this album (which includes the first self-entitled album) is extended by Slint and Bastro."
5,You must get this before it disappears.,"I worked for many bands in the 1980s and saw what felt like a million of them perform in that decade. I saw Nirvana, Motorhead, Specials, the original Van Halen, Black Flag, Replacements, Scratch Acid, Minor Threat, and so many more.Blast Skag Heaven going down the highway and discover what Nirvana wished they could be and tried to be. If you love full throttle, hard punkish music, this is the best there is. Buy, play it, delight in it, be exhilarated, share the power, glory and beauty.The greatest band in American history is Squirrel Bait."
4,Good album,"V good album, with nice spacey, raw feel, compared with her later albums. Maybe a bit more laid back too. Although the review sais it includes Jeff Porcaro, it doesnt, the drummers are James Gadson, and Rick Marotta on this one."
4,Good Set,I have always dug Randy Crawford Her Voice is something else.now the Material She has had over the years hasn't always matched Her Talents to me fully always.but here things are Good.She is a Very Soulful Vocalist.
5,Great Reading!,Read this book and could not put it down! I look forward to the next one. Great background in history and I thought of some of the characters as real Memphis folk!
3,Surprised at the good reviews,"I didn't like this story at all. Mostly because the story is a very old one... seen many times before. And also the camera style annoyed me. Basically we follow Gilda as she deals with her fathers illness, death, and learning of his affair with another woman. Gilda is already obsessed with an actor played by Chris Noth, but becomes increasingly so as she discovers truths about her father and family.The style of the story is very haphazzard with lots of cuts and clips. Made it hard for me to really feel for Gilda.The material itself seemed like movie of the week territory and was boring and trite. I couldn't tell how old Gilda was supposed to be but she can't be too world weary if she can be so easily influenced by a movie star."
2,Misleading photo,"This product has a misleading photo. It shows gray in the photo, but down below it clearly states that it is orange."
3,Ring,"I love this type of eternity band. Unfortunately, one of the stones fell out after 3 times of wearing this ring. I have several of this type of eternity band and this is the first to have a stone fall out."
3,Ok. Book But Not Too Great,"Wouldn't recommend this book if your a beginner. Some of the explanations that Joe Pettitt gives about car audio are not well described and there's no full detail. I believe by the time you finish reading this book you will have a better understanding about car audio, but I don't believe your understanding will be great enough to begin your own install though. I would recommend The Car Stereo Cookbook by Mark Rumreich over this book."
5,very high tech book,"I am wrting to let others know if you want the mathematical and physics involved in stereos, then this is your book. It started out slow, and simple and then jumped right in to complex and over my head. I was looking for a book to give basic advice and wiring diagrams, but this did not happen.It is a very good book if I was more into the technical side of audio. Any way so it you want simple, tell you how then look to another book"
2,Atrocious book,I wouldn't waste 1.00 at the local bookstore if this was on clearance. This book offered no real quality information in my opinion. I feel I wasted my money on this book.
2,"A POPULARLY-WRITTEN, BUT POORLY-DOCUMENTED ATTACK ON EVOLUTION","Kelly L. Segraves is a director and co-founder of the San Diego-based Creation-Science Research Center, and the author/editor of many books, such asJesus Christ Creator,And GOD Created (Volume 1 1), andAnd God Created (Volume 2).Here are some quotations from this 1977 book:""Evidence in many other place of the world indicates that man and dinosaur lived together... Wall paintings in the caves of Rhodesia are rather interesting. These paintings depict the Brontosaurus."" (Pg. 38)""Let us not forget the fact that fossils are not being formed today. Fossils are formed only by rapid burial from a great cataclysmic event such as a flood. Certainly this fact is consistent with the Biblical record. We should expect the fossil record and the Biblical record to agree."" (Pg. 69)""Quite possibly in the next few years the ark of Noah will be rediscovered. Reportedly it has been seen by almost 200 people since 1856."" (Pg. 77)"
4,Good buy,I bought this for my 1 year old niece and I think she'll be able to grow into it and play with it for a few years. Good quality and sounds lovely
4,good for kids,"My 7 year old likes it. The ""skin"" (don't know what synthetic material it really is) on top doesn't quite make the sound I remember my tambourine making, but when I went to a real music store they had the same quality tambourines. So for the price it's adequate. For a kid (which it's made for) it's perfect."
5,Delicious!,"If you like spicy foods, but want lots of flavor... this is the perfect sauce for you!! Perfect on everything!"
4,OVERPRICED,"I know it's just double more here than what I found locally, but wait it's double!I don't know about this source anymore, I shop here very cautiously now since I find a lot of products overpriced big time!"
2,Painfully neurotic.,"I have never read such a neurotic, uptight, angst-filled book as this. The author actually inveighs against the eating of ice cream in public - an expression of his ""not only Talmudic view"" that ""eating in the street is for dogs.""Really. I couldn't make this up.His detailed review of table manners towards the end is quite interesting, but the book is marred by a long, metaphysical, and wholly irrelevant screed against the materialist, science-driven viewpoint that supposedly dominates our culture. Most authors in the humanities just launch into their subject without apology, but Kass' long justification of Why Science Is Insufficient distracts from, and fatally mars, what might otherwise be a very reasonable (if much shorter) review of the culture of food and eating.Curiously, the preface contains a detailed explanation of why the author was not qualified to write this book. I'm inclined to believe him on this point."
5,Holds perfectly with the temporary adhesive mount. Better than the window mount.,"I read reviews regarding the window mount and how it sticks to the window when you try to take it off. So I bought the dash mount, installed it using the temporary adhesive mount and so far it has held just fine. The really hot summer days and really cold winter days will be the real test! Amazon shipping was way ahead of schedule. Got it in 2 days rather than the 5-7 days they told me I should expect."
1,Couldn't get it to stick,I have read other reviews and they seem to be very positive. I tried to mount it on my dashboard and I couldn't get it to stick at all (I didn't try the permanent mount. I ended up returning it and getting the windshield mount). I have had very little problem with the windshield mount. Occasionally I had to put it back up.
5,It does work well,After I bought a NUVI my suction dash did not suck any more then I decided to use the Mount and the Portable Friction Mount 2 months ago. It does work and I think it is better for the visibility to have my NUVI on it.
3,Garmin Mount for nuvi Review,"Works, but if you use this mount there is no way for charging and info cable supplied with nuvi. Info cable has built-in traffic and info when used. Good for around town but not on long trips where you need info such as traffic, speed limits etc."
2,Wish they would have made it flexible,"I First thing i noticed about this dashboard mount when it arrived is it is not flexible, The base is fixed. All you can do is move the rotating holder of the GPS to the position you want. You cannot bend or move the handle fixed to your dash-board. My Earlier Windshield mount (Which broke) had that. The Product looks strong. I Started using the permanent join rather than the temporary one (As i didn't wanted the GPS unit to keep failing, Which happened so many times with the windshield mount until it broke). Over all i am giving 2 stars for the price i am paying for this and the design of this product."
3,The Nuvi 350 comes with dashboard & windshield mounts,"This mount, or something similar, was included with my Nuvi 350.The literature with the Nuvi says the adhesive can be very difficult to remove, so I'm giving it 3 stars because of that. I haven't actually used this mount because I didn't want adhesive all over my car's dash.Want to clarify: If you have a Nuvi, the Nuvi 350 comes with a dashboard mount, so I don't know why you'd need to buy it separately. The Nuvi also comes with the windshield suction mount, both car and AC chargers, and a leather case. Unless you need two, don't order it for the Nuvi.The only thing you'd need to buy separately, if you want one, is the friction mount. I have the one ""for Nuvis"" and it works great! It uses the bracket that comes with the Nuvi unit and did not need any additional part."
1,It Doesn't Work,"Amazon suggested this as an accessory for the Garmin Nuvi 670, so I ordered it. It is impossible to place the Garmin unit onto the mount. This is an expensive mistake for me, as I paid shipping and duty (I live overseas, in Bermuda), and returning it is not inexpensive either. Reading other reviews, it looks like Amazon made the same mistake a lot of times. Don't buy this accessory unless you are absolutely sure it will work with your GPS model."
1,Not Necessary for this product,I bought the automotive mount but it was not necessary. All the gear that you need to mount comes with the product.
5,Dash mount for Nuvi,"I received the window mount with my Nuvi, but wanted the dash mount instead. The dash mount was easy to install and works great!"
3,This is a permanent mount!,"I had to buy a new NUVI mount as my original one broke after 6 months of infrequent use. The description of this mount made me think it was removable, but turns out you have to stick an adhesive on your dash. The package comes with two adhesives (one permanent, the other ""removable"")but the instructions don't specify which is which, so if you make the 50/50 mistake of putting the permanent adhesive on, you'll have a difficult time removing it. I returned the product to Amazon."
2,Garmin NUVI mount,This package is not applicable to the Nuvi 660 unit.The ball mount & sticky pads are o.k. but the interface connector is not compatible with the Nuvi 660. The interface does not match the 660 mounting features and the power connector doesn't match the cable that is shipped with the 660.The concept of being able to easily move the unit from one vehicle to the next is not as convenient as you would expect.
3,"come on Amazon, check what you sell !","I recently purchased Garmin 360, plus Amazon recomended additional accessories, vehicle power cable 010-10723-06 + carrying case 010-10723-02. These items ARE also part of the GPS kit, which I returned at my own cost as Amazon determined ordering them was my own fault, and as of today credit was not issued.To add insult to injury, the included Garmin Automotive Mount for Nuvi (010-10723-04 ?) does NOT fit . Fortunately Garmin Product Support emailed me to replace same in 5-7 business days.Incidently, the GPS works great with map updates although to update took for evvvvverrrrr"
5,Nice Mount,"Fantastic... this solves the only complaint I had for my Nuvi 350 - it kept falling off the windshield (suction cups wouldn't hold)... with this I can easily have a mount on my dashboard, put the Nuvi up when using, and take it down to keep it out of view"
2,You have only one chance to get it right,"This product is very unforgiving. In our case, the disc wouldn't stick at all because we had applied Armor All to our dash a few weeks ago. The Armor All sure did a great job at rejecting the adhesive. Unfortunately the adhesive on the Garmin disc was rendered unuseable since it had been exposed."
3,Not animal proof,Indestructible? Maybe if you don't have cats and ferrets. The rubbery casing is Great for little ferret and kitten teeth. I never got to try the product as the animals had it for dinner as I was cooking mine. The key board that matches this I was able to save and works great (you have to mash the keys a little harder than a regular key board).
5,washable optical mouse,"This mouse performs well. I have not washed it as it is new. The keyboard that matches the mouse (water-proof, flexible, lighted) also performs well and it is neat-looking and convenient to travel."
5,All of my yes,"Some people argue that one or the other Lion King movie is the best. Really, I love the music from the first two movies. I agree that the soundtrack of the second movie is not quite as moving as the original soundtrack, but holy crap, have you ever listened to ""He Lives In You"" through a set of great speakers??? I get goose bumps all over my body!!! It's incredible. I love this CD."
5,Great Soundtrack,"I absolutely love this soundtrack. Every song on this album is a treasure, and makes you want to play this cd over and over again. I never get tired of hearing every song on this soundtrack."
4,Mmm...,"I think all the songs in this soundtrack are worth listening to, but this soundtrack is not so good as ""Return to Pride Rock"". Because many good songs were not in this soundtrack, such as ""Song For the Children"" ""The Lion Sleeps Tonight"" and ""I Want to See the Moon"". Well, I don't like this soundtrack, but I appreciate the cover of this soundtrack was cute. So I rate it 4 stars! ^_^"
1,I didn't buy this book,"Well, why not?I have to admit that this book on David looks good. However, whilst flipping thru the book, I came across the end section and there was this picture of the author in full frontal nudity, in a heroic pose. I don't see the link between a photo of a naked man and David's biography.I can only attribute this to the fact that the author is indulging in narcissistic display."
2,Not happy,This watch is considerably thicker than most Movado watches. I've had it 2 weeks and already have scratches on the bezel which is made of a very thin chrome plating. I do not recommend this watch.
4,Baglioni's first album,"The first album of Baglioni's almost three decades presence on the music scene, it already shows the great promise of a great musician. This album broke free from the early 70's Italian musical tradition because of its being a sung story: the author's first love narrated in melody. A main theme runs throughout the whole album, with the songs fading one into the other as Baglioni describes the first encounter, first kiss and final loss. The titles are: 1. Piazza del popolo, 2. Una faccia pulita, 3. Battibecco,4. Con tutto l'amore che posso, 5. Che begli amici!, 6. Mia liberta', 7. La prima volta, 8. Quel giorno, 9. Io ti prendo come mia sposa, 10. Cartolina rosa, 11. Questo piccolo grande amore, 12. Porta portese, 13. Quanto ti voglio, 14. Sembra il primo giorno, 15. Con tutto l'amore che posso (finale)."
3,Pulido has potential,"Bobby Pulido is a nice new face in the expanding Tejano universe, but he has not yet reached his potential. I think his good looks and lineage have realy helped him. but he needs work in the vocal department. Half the tracks on this new CD are forgettable....maybe he is getting lazy? He's good at the cumbias, and as Ramiro Burr wrote in the ""Billboard Guide to Tejano and regional Mexican Music"" book, Bobby ""patiently honed his vocal talents and wisely assembled a smart management team, key to the success of any group."" Right, now Bobby just needs to develop his vocals."
2,"Somewhat Informative, but Overall Trying to Blame Accusatory","I believed this DVD would contain information on the mining of gold, its properties, and general applications. The video does contain such information, but that's only 1/3 or less of its content. Overall, gold is depicted as some evil potion that has resulted in the deaths of millions in vain attempts to acquire it. Frankly, anything of value will result in the deaths of millions in vain attempts to acquire it. Lastly, the economists are worthless Keynesians touting the glory of fiat currency - particularly amusing during our time of high inflation. One comes away thinking that the shiny metal has an ability to drive men mad. In other words, this is 1/3 documentary, and the latter a viewpoint."
4,Does what its supose to do,Nice product.What I was looking for.Not to much to talk about it.Recommend this if you want to keep your fridge organized
1,Threw It Away,"This appears to be a space saver, but try this: Take six 12 oz cans of soda/beer and put them on your counter in two rows standing up. Now create some bookends with something and put six cans on their side, side to side, and stack six more on top. Did you save any space? You did not.Now add in the fact that this device has sides on it and is somewhat elevated and you will see that it takes up more space than the cans alone.If the device worked as it appears, you could easily fill from the top and take from the bottom, which would allow warm in and cold out. I found that half the time the cans jammed.It wasn't worth returning, so I threw it away."
3,Better than a stack of cans,"A great way to store your favorite canned beverages in the fridge. My only beef with these was that the cans have a tendency to jam when moving from the upper level to the lower level, but that is a small nuance.For the money, it's a great buy, and well made - certainly not at all like the flimsy ones available elsewhere."
2,doesn't stack,"I Purchased this to stack them in a small space. well, they don't really stack well. I have two stacked together and it is a big pain to fill them and stack them. If you just want one to go in the fridge they would be fine, but if you want to stack several together, this is not the one to get."
4,much better than those plastic-covered wire ones,I store canned sodas in a sideboard cupboard and needed something more convenient than the 12-packs. I had a couple of racks that wereflimsy and more trouble than the 12-packs. These are sturdy and thepop cans move through as they are supposed to. I'm very pleased.
4,Great product,I've had a wire beverage dispenser for years and the cans were constantly getting stuck at the back and didn't feed through. This one works perfectly. I would recommend it to anyone that is looking for a beverage dispenser.
2,Cans jam when they roll.,"The sides of this dispenser are quite a bit wider than the standard soft drink can. As a result, cans twist and jam when they are rolled into the dispenser. Each time I try to fill it, cans jam in the tracks."
2,Stackable 12-can Despenser White,"These would be really good if they were made of more sturdy material. Too flimsy. Need cross support on top.If they make these changes would recomend, an otherwise not."
2,No longer use it,"This was a bit too long so it made closing the refrigerator door either tough or impossible, can't remember. It also can slide around a little as it is not fixed and takes up some space."
2,OK if you don't intend to stack them,"I purchased three of these, hoping to stack two of them. They don't stack well at all so I will be returning all three :-("
2,Cans get stuck,I bought this for my wife so it would save space in the fridge and the cans are constantly getting stuck in it.
5,Amazing!,This book is truly amazing. Just to know and learn about what these men and their families went through to serve our Almighty Lord is heart warming. Jim Elliot is such a man of inspiration - as are the rest of the men and their families that were involved in the mission to the Auca indians. It brought me to tears in more ways than one. I highly recommend this book!
4,A deeply moving and inspiring book,"This is an incredible story about following Jesus and seeking to reach tribal people for Him. This book contains extensive journal entries from the five men involved, so provides a rich amount of detail. Most of the book is comprised of these entries, with Elliot mostly providing background information and transitions between entires. She doesn't fully express herself until the Epilogues, which are very powerful. This book is sure to have a profound impact on all who read it. Highly recommended."
4,Good Book,"I found this book to be a nice read... applicable to everyday life, not just to what the title indicates."
1,"Regrettable, and not recommended.","This book will only appeal to the ""believer"" side of the believer/nonbeliever marital union. There is no good information about compromise, counseling, or relationship building outside of the believer's faith. This book simply preaches patience on the part of the believer as they wait for their non-believing partner to finally come around to the ""correct"" way of thinking. This book is a complete insult to the ""non-believer"" spouse. Too bad. So much could be gained by providing a comprehensive road map to a frank and open discussion between spouses with differing religious beliefs about how to nurture a loving, and mutually respectful marital relationship. Regrettable, and not recommended."
5,Great to wear with jeans,I love wearing this with jeans. It is a very unique pendant. I have gotten several compliments on it. I have the earrings as well. It finishes off a nice casual outfit.
3,Read the Dimensions,It is cute in person but smaller than expected. Be sure to read the dimesions. About an inch across and 1/2 inch high.
3,Not exactly what we expected.,"Our fireplace is in our family room. Winters you can feel the cool air coming in, and it is not pleasant. We checked out different ""pillows"" for the fireplace and thought this was our best bet. It does not seal up the chimney. It is better, but still a disappointment."
5,Outstanding Draft Block,This product really works. It was easy to install. I bought the largest one for a real brick fireplace and it fit perfectly. There was a noticable difference immediately.
3,Pricey for what it is.,"It's a nice concept, but for the price I paid ($52), I would expect higher quality. It's made in America, which is great. The plastic support can bend pretty easily, which made it tricky to get inside my 1876 chimney. A simple, straight chimney would be more ideal for it. Once installed, it's pretty well fixed our draft problem.We ordered three of these, and one of them arrived with a slice already through it, like someone poked it with a box cutter. We've tried using duct tape, but it's proven to be too weak for the pressure. We may just resort to using real pillows instead."
3,Works okay,it was great and was fairly easy to install. But there was no opening for wire going up to dampner at top of chimney.
2,Can't get it to work satisfactorily,"I've tried this in our fireplace several times, trying different rates of inflation and positioning, but no matter what I do it still has small areas at the folds where air gets through, bringing smoke from an adjacent chimney down into the fireplace."
2,Chimney pillow,When I installed the 'pillow' it would not form a tight seal but rather buckled leaving gaps allowing the heat from the house to flow out - defeating the purpose of the pillow.
1,Does not hold up when fitted around damper handle,"This item worked well in one instance and failed in the next. When you fit the item over the damper handle, one of them continued to tear into the fabric even tho the cut stopped in the proper place. Very fragile, not a good buy at a 50 percent lose rate. Very frustrating."
4,"Lasted for a few years, then developed a leak","My ex husband installed one of these things a couple of years ago and every once in a while we'd have to blow it up a little bit. But it had a tremendous effect on our heating bill... I'd say we easily saved $100 a year or more. We live in the Mid-Atlantic region and have a gas furnace. This winter when I went to puff it up a little bit, it popped. But there is really nothing else like it on the market, and it worked great for a while... so I'll buy another one.You should note that if you plan to use your fireplace occasionally, this chimney balloon thing makes it VERY inconvenient..."
4,Decent but cumbersome,"I would recommend this product for its energy saving properties. The directions are simple enough and it's fairly easy to inflate. Essentially, it's a balloon. Positioning the product in the chimney is the only part of the process I found mildly difficult as it tends to be a bit cumbersome and hard to properly position."
2,Inflatable fire place plug,The very smooth plastic makes it difficult--or impossible--to properly fit into a sloping space. I was not able to install this product in our chimney space--it may work in other situations.
3,OK!,This is actually one of the more interesting books for younger readers. The other Data books weren't that good.
3,A good but not great barbie,"Dear reader,I found this barbie fun when i got it but after i had had it awhile it started to get preaty boring. Since it is still preaty boring i only use her clothing,now. I don't really recomend it, but if you really want it, it's ok with me. I found out 3 things.1.There is a button on the leg witch you push for it to light upAnd spins. 2.The long skirt get in the way when it lights up and spin. 3.The time that the light up belt lights up most in when there isn't much light..."
5,The wonder of Barbie.,"Who would have thought that blue streaked hair and a belt that sparkles would have become a successful doll? Mattel obvioulsy paid attention to the changes in society and honored the need each generation has for individuality.First my daughter was delighted with hers, and made clothes for a lot of children as they played with Barbie. Next my four granddaughters played with Barbie for years, and one has a magnificent collection -- each is cherished in a much different way now than when she was little and played with them. Today three of my four great-granddaughters bring back happy memories of earlier times during my life as they play with Barbie.Time passes, but only a few toys cross generations to still be a favorite toy."
2,Starlight Fairy Barbie -- Fun or Flop?,"I don't say Starlight Fairy Barbie is bad, but my niece has one and she popped its head off because it was so boring. Her mother says that it wasn't teaching her anything except for how to wreck Barbies. That shows that it isn't durable. The head is made of a substance easy for a little dog to shred, choke on, and... oh, I don't want to talk about it. And what about the people in England who spell fairy f-a-e-r-i-e? I am completly American, but I spell it faerie because of addiction to this one website. Fun, or flop? Your opinion."
1,Barbie looks fun but is difficult,"I bought this barbie for my daughters birthday. I wasn't impressed. Having to reset the barbie to get it to spin was a pain. Also, I took all the clothes off and still couldn't get it to spin with new batteries. I ended up purchasing 2 and brought both of them back. I bought the snow white Barbie instead. That was bigger hit!"
1,Dont bother with this fairy,"I just would like to say that barbie is a piece of junk.The starlight fairy barbie does not have any educational value whatsoever and absolutely no fun factor either. It (starlight fairy barbie) is just another way for the Mattel co. to make money off of young children who THINK that they are getting a great toy, when what they are getting is a skydancer spinoff....I DO NOT RECCOMMEND THIS TOY!!!"
1,Beware of what you are buying,"I am deeply disappointed at this CD. It was not performed by the original artists and there is no warning label of saying so, which I think is cheating. The mix wasn't that good either. I wish I checked amazon's review before wasting my money on this."
2,another botched assimilation,"This album's only strong point is its beat. The engineers did a fine job with the music. While faithful to the lyrics and the success of the songs, none of the songs are sung by the original artists. Personally, I couldn't bring myself to hear or own ""Santo, Santo"" sung by anyone else other than SPC and Gloria."
4,Buy This Album for Wyclef's Cover of Fortunate Son!,"I bought this album for Wyclef Jean's Cover of Creedence Clearwater Revival's ""Fortunate Son"". Love this cover and the rest of the music by7 Rachel Portman is good an takes you on a journey through the movie."
3,Interesting,"Since it is the first book in the series, it lacks the approximately 10 pages of historical fact that the latter books in the series do have. I did miss that and wished that they had explained the ice hole.I enjoyed the story, but I felt that the ending was a bit rushed. I like that they lived happily ever after, but I did not expect her to fall for Ice Fire (don't want to give it all away). They did have a lot in common, but....Like the other books in the series that I have read (People of the Sea, River, Moon, Silence, and Masks)I was thoroughly engrossed in the story.I am the author of Summer Born: A Life With Cerebellar Ataxia andDreams in August: Life, Love, and Cerebellar Ataxia"
5,Great Read,Very interesting and exciting read. I highly recommend this book. I will enjoy readingother books written by these authors
4,People of the Wolf,"A good departure from all the ""murder-mystery-mahem"" books of the present time. On a par with Jean Auel. Easy reading and an interesting plot."
3,Good but not great,Good book that flowed nicely. But in the kindle version there are a few periods in weird places that can make it hard to read. But overall a good book.
3,People of the wolf,"The book is woren but not to bad for the age,it is smaller than all the aother books that I have bythe authers."
1,In simple terms: do not read this book,"This is simply a bad and boring book. The characters are one dimensional, the plot is strained, the storyline incoherent and much too bloody. I can`t beleive anyone who has read Auel can like this."
2,Not very good,This book was like a movie with a decent story line but horrible acting and a bad script. It wasn't engaging and the characters weren't very original. The book was extremely predictable and kept my eyes rolling. It was just not a very good book. I don't think I can force myself to read the rest of the series.
1,People of the Wolf,"This is a poorly written book. The scenes are boring, and the writing, amateurish. The dialogue drove me crazy with the author's constant use of dashes to signify incomplete/interrupted thoughts. The 'beliefs' and superstitions, which are a big part of the genre, were not believable and poorly presented as were the dream sequences. The plot is good enough, but the author wasn't able to capitalize on it because of his/her limitations on writing. This book is a waste of time and money. If you want to read good prehistoric novels, try Sue Harrison's Chagak-Kiin trilogy and the first three books of William Sarabande (Beyond the Sea of Ice, Corridor of Storms, and Forbidden Land). They are fast paced, contain exciting plots, and have good believable characters."
3,"Okay, but hard to start","This book was actually good after reading 5 bagillion chapters about dreaming. The climax is okay, and I think it sounded almost like a honest to goodness story (like what they actually said)."
2,Slow as a moving glacier!,"Were the authors told they would be paid by the number of words they could write for this book? The story could have been more effectively told in less than 2/3 of its actual length.Although the many, many main characters were all colorfully drawn, they read more like 20th century homo sapiens pretending to be prehistoric homo sapiens.Read this book only if you have nothing better on your bookshelf."
2,Too Modern of a Tale,"I really wanted to like this book, because I like the historical subject matter. But even after a second go through of this book (and through the second), it just isn't taking hold. Maybe I was hoping for more history. Yes, I realize that the authors will have to do a lot of guesswork at this era. But why do they seem so much like more recent natives? Like these were the same people the Europeans ran across? That doesn't mean there isn't any interesting characters within all of the visions and hocus pocus. For now I'll stick to excellent non-fiction accounts likeThe First Americans: In Pursuit of Archaeology's Greatest Mystery,1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus&The Founders of America."
1,People of the Confused Message,"This is the perfect example of why couples should not write books together. The voice, message and delivery are confused, lacking in focus and not the anthropological message I was hoping for. How do books this weak find a publisher?"
3,"Well researched, but very slow starter; solid history lesson",The book takes forever to get started. Nearly threw it away during laborous reading first 10 chapters. Got very tired of hearing about dreaming.
2,Might have been a more interesting movie,"Like another reviewer the name usage was very cumbersome. Where I didn't have trouble figuring out that the wind, sun and animals were in fact that and not people, an arguement early in the book among the tribe had my head spinning trying to figure out which nature name was which; and I'm pretty sure one of the people was arguing with himself. The endurance of these hardy people does seem pretty super human but ignoring that in an early wolf hunt by explicit description the only clothing the hero had on was mittens. I think the concept is interesting but it was easier to cross the Bearing Strait than to read this book."
1,Hoped it would be good; ready to give it up!,"I've read a little over 40 pages. I keep hoping that the poor dialogue writing and absolute ludicrous use of contemporary phrases are just my imagination. But after reading several of the reviews here, I fear that I'm reading a lemon and just don't want to waste my time anymore."
2,Not sent what I ordered,I ordered a Spalding set from you and received a Halex set which is an inferior product to the Spalding which you advertised and I thought I was getting. I did then contact the Hardware store that shipped the product and they refused to acknowledge that they sent something different than what was shown in the sales ad. I thought that is considered a bait and switch which I also thought was illegal.
2,First act MX011 Guitar Stand review,I purchased this stand for my teenage daughter. It did not last a year. I would not recommend this product.
3,- blakdawg'z review of ruff ryders - ryde or die vol.2 -,i gotz 2 admit dat dis iz da worst ruff ryders cd i've heard - the beats in some of the songz are weak..(holiday)(ww3)..swizz beatz had killed some of da songz in da cd dat kould have been tyta' then xpekted - ay yo' but besydez all dat.. da kombo of rappa' are pretty ill and tyte intro of da new ruff ryders - the song 'got it all' iz da only good song on da cd and ova'all it'z a 3 yo' - blakdawg
5,They just don't make 'em like this anymore,"I really enjoyed this old-time swashbuckler. The whole movie is excellent and it's great seeing these old-time actors and character actors in such a rollicking and good old-time-fun kind of movie--the kind they unfortunately don't make enough of anymore.As others have already written complete reviews here I just had one observation to make, which I offer more as trivia rather than a real criticism. The swordfight scene at the end between Coleman and Fairbanks is well done except for the obviously fake moment of Fairbanks's death--you can clearly see Coleman's sword passes behind his body, especially since it's done as a camera close-up. Obviously they got better at doing these sorts of things in later movies.Overall, though, a great movie which became the archetype for many remakes and variations on the theme of the misadventures of the commoner impersonating royalty, but which was never outdone."
1,taken for a ride,It doesn't do what it claims it is supposed to do i.e. separate the filters- what else can I say?
1,terrible disappointment,"I was so desperate after breaking my Mr. Coffee filter grabber from the 80s that despite the overwhelming number of negative reviews on this product, I was wiling to give it a try. Believe the negative reviews, this does NOT work! The round grabbers don't allow enough contact and the rubber is not soft and sticky. I, like so many other people, wish Mr. Coffee would make their little aqua and white grabber again; it was fabulous. This one isn't."
1,Disapointing,I ordeered two of these. One for me and one for my husbands office. I could not make them work and neither could he. Sorry but I tossed them. Too much trouble to send them back.
1,Worthless,This product does not work. It grabs more than one filter and wrinkles them all up. This is the first time I have ever written a review. Bought this for an elderly parent and am very disappointed with the product.
1,It does not work,the material of the tips is not tacky and does not grab the filter. The shape of the tips does not grab the filter paper. Even after using a Demrel tool to ruff up the tips and reshape them this thing does not work. It is useless. Do not buy it.
2,Coffee Filter Separator,"The separator works as advertised. However, it broke after 4 to 6 weeks. The price of almost $20 is absurd. It is widely available on the web for about $3.00. This would be a far better product if it were made of metal. Then it might be worth $20."
1,Does now work!!!,The rubber tips are to hard. Waste of money. The tips need to be a softer more pliable material to work effectivly.
1,does not work,This does not pick up the filter papets at all. I was replacing one which worked well but broke and hoped this would do the same. I was very disappointed.
1,These do not work!,"These coffee filter tongs do not work at all. The square tips do not get close enough together to pick up the filters, and the rubberized ends are too slick to grab the filter. Do not waste your money on these! I ordered two and sent both back."
2,I was so happy to find these...,"I was so happy to find these, ordered them, and they worked well but did not last long. I was using them very gently but they broke in a very short time."
1,Doesn't Work at all!!,"I bought two of these, one for home, one for work, they don't work at all. Disappointed, to say the least."
1,Not like it used to be...,I had one of these for many years and loved it. It recently broke so I ordered a replacement. This new one does not have the same soft rubber tips and does NOT separate coffee filters. Very disappointed!
2,Not as good as it should be,"For almost $6 this item does not work well at akk, The rubber grips are hard and therefore have little or no grip for obtaining a single coffee filter from a stack. Soft, spongy ends would have made the product work better."
2,"Separator, Yes and No","Separator works OK on four cup filters, but anything bigger, did not work at all."
3,Not Gold,"After listening to their Gold CDs at least 100 times in the past few years, I expected the same from this CD. Not nearly the sound I hoped for, but OK. I have many Christmas CDs and LPs and Cassettes to list to that I love, so it is hard for a group to break into my favorites. This one will not, but maybe once a year I will listen and try to love."
3,Great Information - Difficult to Digest,"Mr. Carret was a well-respected financier who spent a lot of time and thought putting to paper the ideas that helped him build a fortune for himself and his clients. The ideas that he writes on, value-investing, market forecasting, evaluating a company's R&D prospects are relevant to this day, and are valuable given the age of the text.However, this is a somewhat difficult book to read, indeed arguably one of the most difficult to read texts in the Wiley Investment Classic series. With that in mind, I would only suggest it's reading to the dedicated financier who has already digested many of the other fine historical banking books that are available.Again, this is a good book, but it's wording is old and often not very direct. The graphs and charts need further touching up as they are also somewhat difficult to decipher."
2,Old,"Has some applicable info, but a lot of its outdated like reading the tape. For the seasoned vet I can't find a reason to buy this. For someone just starting out, you could learn something but there are many more books out there that are newer and more revelant. I personally like any of William O'Neils books for long term investing, as for day trading I like the work of John Person who has two books available last time I checked. (Both good reads)"
1,Baddddddd!,"We are not happy with this guitar at all. We bought it because it is listed as a quality instrument @ a retail price of $129.00. It would not tune without cracking & popping. It has black paint smeared on the pink paint. It has black paint not even finished on the trim. It is not as advertised. We feel that we should get a 100% refund without a restock fee, due to very substandard quality. My wife teaches guitar & she says it is an unplayable instrument at any cost."
1,When will it come?,Iam not happy with this company because i ordered a guitar on June 8th 2009 and yet to recieve it yet and ups hasnt recieved it at all to bring it to my house and also you would think that they would send it the next day but they didnt and they also lost my packages to send to ups so iam very upset with this company and good luck to anybody that orders from them every again and trying to get a hold of them is like pulling teeth because you cant even talk to anybody from the company to complain about anything they tell you that you have to email them to get a hold of them.
4,great value,the guitar is great for the price. the gig bag is kind of skimpy and there were no accessories.
5,nice guitar for the money,bought this for our grandgirls for christmas. they simply love it and now one of them would like to start lessons. we wish there was a book of maybe a very simple song to start.
1,Seller had to refund $$$ after realizing none in stock,"When i never received this item and had to inquire about it, the seller just refunded money and I had to purchase a different guitar. I would really think twice about buying from them again. They don't seem to be on top of things. The item (once received after the second purchase) is kinda cheap but a good starter guitar. I am giving this item 1 star because of the company inwhich it was purchased from. All items advertised were received."
3,Need to know greek,"I haven't had much experience with lexicons, so I didn't really know what I was ordering. You need to know greek in order to even begin to understand this book. I do not know greek and it wasn't easy for me to pick up and find anything, so I unfortunately had to send this one back. I'm sure it is a wonderful reference, if you know greek."
3,Excellent and Disappointing,"The first chapter of this book was so well written that I was caught. I often had trouble putting the book down. Unfortunately, the brilliant parts of the book were too seldom. I am from Fresno and really enjoyed the parts of the book that dealt with Fresno's history of corruption and I also enjoyed the author's investigations into the murder. However, the family history was largely irrelevant to the murder and generally boring to me (I think that Armenian immigrants or other European immigrants would probably enjoy these parts). The author could have written two seperate books: one about his family and one about the murder. The author has put a lot of time and research into this book and I hope that he will consider writing a more complete history of Fresno's history of police and political corruption."

3,It was entertaining until I found a careless mistake.,"I agree with the reviewer who was pleased to see a contrarian view of Jane Austen being presented. No one who was as sickeningly sweet as she is portrayed in other biographies (most notably the ones written by family members) could possibly have written the letters and books Austen wrote.I was inclined to like Nokes' book, but then read something rather disturbing. He states without hesitation that Mary was the youngest of the Bennet sisters in Pride and Prejudice. This is not true; Mary is the third of the five sisters. Maybe it's a nitpicky thing, but I then started to wonder if he got such a basic fact wrong, what else in this book is incorrect?"
1,Ouch! This book was too painful for me to finish,"In all honesty, I could not bring myself to read this whole book, so if you prefer to ignore my opinion, I will quite understand. (I have only read 40-50 pages, but found it so depressing, I gave up!) Here is my review, for what it's worth!I was quite prepared to grant Mr. Nokes' premise that Jane Austen was not the sugary-sweet homebody that others have made her out to be, but I really do not think she or her family could really be as bad as he insists. I have, for instance, a hard time believing that Mr. Austen encouraged his daughter's writing solely on the mercenary view of augmenting the family's income. I am willing to give credence to Mr. Nokes' arguments of the Austen family's imperfections. I could forgive him a lot easier, however, if he didn't appear to gloat over their defects."
5,Don't forget the cars,"We just bought this for our son, he just turned four. We also have a 2 1/2 year boy too. Both of them take it apart quite easily, which is fine but it takes some time to put back together. The dinosaur wobbles quite a bit. I would also recommend making sure an adult supervises the play with this toy because it does shoot the cars out with great force. It did not come with race cars nor batteries. If you decide to purchase, make sure you get them so your not digging in your toy box for cars. I was a little annoyed with this since I paid almost, $60 at a local retailer (should've bought through amazon). The toy however is very entertaining and fun to watch it shoot the cars. The kids love to make the dinosaur roar too."
2,Unstable and a little dangerous,"This toy does fall apart if moved. As long as it sits in one spot no problem. It is a little dangerous though. Metal cars and high speed. Do NOT get your head in the way. IT HURTS!!! My boys 8/6 have fun with it but out of their 100 hot wheels cars only about 7 work with it. It's not the worst toy out there, but it sure isn't the best either."
5,T-Wreck a BIG HIT for our 4 year old...,This toy has been an absolute hit at our house ever since arriving! Received for a gift and would recommend! This is a toy and not a babysitter so adult supervision is definitely recommended. We had several kids here for a party and the T-Wrecks was the hit!(ages 3yrs-10yrs) Looking for a great gift for the kid who loves hot wheels? Look no further...T-Wrecks is a must have!
2,Grandmother of 2,"A birthday present,what a waste of money..The little ones played with once. Ages 7/4 They use the dinosaur head for a mask. Very unsteady,and hard to make work. Also for the price, no cars(not all hot wheels will fit on track). This is going to be a return,and purchasing something better for our hard earned money!"
1,Glad I read the reviews,"I was planning on getting this for my son for Christmas. I am glad that I read the other parents reviews, it has changed my mind. We already have enough toys that aren't sturdy and are easily disassembled but not so easy to reassemble!!! I don't need to buy him something that is going to get tucked away for a ""better time""! THANKS to all who left a review!"
3,Be careful of hot wheels,I am always leery of spending much of anything on Hot Wheels playsets since they fall apart so easily and never work as well as the advertisements like to show them working. It is hard to resist since my four-year-old has actually been saving his money to buy this (I did not realize it was a Hot Wheels product when he talked about it). Hopefully he will find something else to get his heart set on since none of his other hot wheels products have lasted.
2,Disappointing,"My six year old got this from ""Santa"" for Christmas. It broke on the second day and it only keeps his attention for a limited time. Now we have to explain how we can return things to a store that Santa brought from the North Pole. The only thing he likes about it now is that it looks so cool. Otherwise, this is a major disappointment."
4,The look will be worth it!,"I just put this track together. I did it today because I thought it would take forever by listening to the reports on the news. It took about 20 minutes. I could have done this Christmas eve. It is the neatest looking toy. I have yet to work it, not wanting to wake up my son. I moved it from the living room to the garage and found that it did come apart but I had figured that out in advance and the pieces that come apart should come apart so that you can move it around. If it doesn't work correctly it will be okay because just the look on my 4 yo face when he wakes up on Christmas morning and sees this will be priceless. There is enough going on at the bottom of the track that will keep him busy. I got it for $30.00 and don't think I paid too much. I'm glad I bought it when I did."
2,"Difficult to put together, did not work","I purchased this for my Grandson, who is almost 4, whom we had an early Christmas. After spending 2 hours trying to put it together, it didn't even work right. The cars would not follow the correct path, and the picture on the box is very deceiving. I do not recommend this toy, and am very disappointed in it."
1,I wish we saw the reviews before purchasing,"My 5 year old son received this as a birthday gift from his grandparents. I plan to return it this weekend. Very simply, time consuming to put together...tall structure is unstable...pieces come apart way too easily...noisy motor...my 5 year old and 9 year old never got a car to go through the mouth. It just does not work."
1,Looks alot better on tv,"I would not have given it any stars if I had that option! I should have read the other reviews before buying. I have to agree with everyone else, it is flimsy, and unstable. The braces dont want to stay on it, and most of his cars wont fit in it. You would think that because of this, they would have included some cars with the playset. I wasnt exactly cheap, especially since I purchased it with no discounts. Do yourself a favor and avoid! Unless you like to spend hours putting something together that falls apart within minutes."
3,Be Very Careful!,"This toy is not at all appropriate for a small child! I am very shocked that it was ever approved for use for small children. I have two boys, a 5-year-old and a 3-year-old. They both loved the toy when I put it together. However, after I left them to play with it alone within half and hour they had figured out that if you take the dinosaur's head off the toy becomes a rocket launcher! And trust me the litlle metal cars go flying! Honestly, they both loved it but it is entirely too dangerous."
2,No Good!!,"It falls apart very easily. It's defintally not worth (...)!! And actualy it's not even that fun, my 5 year old played with it for 5 minutes, and never touched it again!!"
2,Don't waste your money!!!,"This toy fell apart after spending an hour putting it together. It seems really cool, but you cannot move it once it is put together and we all clear the area when it is turned on. It seems very dangerous to me. Besides sitting and watching the thing spit out cars, I don't see what is so great about it. For your money, there are a lot better toys out there."
3,BATTERIES!!!,"This toy takes Four ""D"" Batteries and Three ""AA"" batteries as listed on the actual box! The website is wrong."
2,Hot Wheels,"I want to thank the people that reviewed this product as well. After buying the ""must have"" Jet City last year for my son who was 4 at the time it also fell apart. I think he was able to play with it 2-3 days max before it fell apart and the main piece broke( the airplane). My son was asking about the T-Rex for Christmas and my husband and I were both thinking no - I was double checking to see if this product was any better and it look like its not - I hope Hot Wheels starts to read these reviews."
3,Fun for while but tough to keep upright........,"This toy is for 4 and up and little kids love it but its really too hard for them to play with; it only uses certain size cars and its not so easy to get it all to work just right to get the cars in the mouth, when it does and releases them, you have to reset the mouth/head and thats not so easy either; this is in part due to the fact its wobbly and very hard to keep upright; if an adult can't be there every moment, it will be hard and frustrating for the kids - maybe older kids will do better with it, it can really fun but only for a while. I thought of this now as it ended up in my son's closet and we are giving it away today due to lack of use. Would recommend under limited circumstances."
2,What a disappointment,"My mom got this for my 4 year old son for Christmas. It was a huge disappointment for him and us. This toy is not for at all for a 4 year old and the durability of it does not even deserve one star. It was so bad, we put it in a trash bag on Christmas day:("
2,Shade shelter,"A bit cumbersome. Not as high as I thought it would be from photo. I didn't stake it down right away, and the poles bent in the wind."
3,Overall good product,"This canopy worked well once we got it up. We had some difficulty putting it together, the directions were a bit confusing, but not the end of the world. Once together, it would not stay straight, so we had to securely fasten it to the ground and to the bordering fence in order for it to stay up. Once secured it worked great. It even held up one night when there were almost tornado-like winds, and a lot of heavy rain; it only adjusted a bit. Overall very good, but it has to be securely fastened to the ground. Also we had ours setup in a corner of our back yard against a fence; I'm not sure how it would hold up without something firm for it to lean against."
4,A MUST READ FOR 'WINGS IN THE NIGHT' FANS!,The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because I found Ms. Shayne's use of the 1st person confusing. This is Jamey's story. Here we see the whole gang of the 'Twilight' series deep in trouble again as they 'meddle' in Jamey's life.
1,not for me!,"I liked the later books in this series And went back to read the earlier books so far I have not like any of them. The characters make no sense. Call for help then get mad at them for coming. the heroine spends the entire book calling the man she drained And left for dead, causling him to become a vampire a monster. Not a likeable group of people til later books, I was routing for the bad guys for awhile. Their decisions were just lacking sense! Every page I was thinking (oh please!)"
2,Disappointing,"I was excited about viewing this DVD. Unfortunately, the quality of the production was less than I had hoped for. Not so much a problem with the DVD as with the quality of the filming itself. Seems dated, and not up to the finest of BBC productions. Cannot recommend."
2,Bad Audio,"I was so disappointed with the audio. I am not sure if the accent was such a very thick English accent or the audio was bad, but I couldn't understand what Miss Marple was saying,it sounded garbled. The acting and scenery are wonderful, but because of this, I couldn't follow the movie and understand it. I tried to watch the same movie a second time, hoping to get it better, but I couldn't. I haven't bothered with the other movies on the CD, because I couldn't even get through the first one. I had been waiting excitedly for this set and now I wish I could get my money back. It was so disappointing."
1,Bad Batch?,"I ordered this DVD set and we were looking forward to many hours of enjoyable viewing. Some of the DVD's in the set, however, had digital scrambling problems, so we did the Amazon return thing, requesting that a replacement set be sent. When we received that replacement set, we were very disappointed to see that the digital scrambling was exactly the same as in the first set. I don't know if we got two from the same bad batch, or what, but now we don't have the set we were looking forward to placing in our video library."
1,NO closed captioning/sound quality,"My husband, who has difficulty hearing, and I tried to watch the first episode and couldn't because the sound was not very clear. These tapes DO NOT have closed caption so we had to sell them before we were able to watch them. It even seemed to me, and I have excellent hearing, that the sound wasn't that great."
3,"Falsely advertised, but a good set of flicks","Because I have a hearing deficit, I always look for movies with subtitles/captions. In its technical info here at Amazon, this set is advertised to have English subtitles; it does not. The stories are still interesting to the rest of the family, but they have to stop and explain to me every few minutes if I am to know what is happening."
3,"Purchased @ Amazon and Better than ever, BUT ...","These are better than ever on clear, crisp DVDs. Delivered quickly & packaged nicely. BUT for those of us needing closed captioning or Subtitles for the Deaf/Hard of Hearing, it is a great disappointment. We would love to have these classics with SDH, but it's not there on this set."
4,"These are okay, but flaws for Agatha Christie fans","I caught this movie on CBC. I had just finished the book, and it was great to see a modern version of a Agatha Christie movie. The movie was filmed in 2004, so compared to some it was very modern. The basic facts were the same, with some things changed and others omitted (as is usually done in fllms I find), but overall is was a really good adaptation.The final scene that shows the hanging of the murderer was quite eery, to say the least. Possibly I will stick to just reading the books. Less nightmares for me!"
3,Surely not the best of Agatha Christie,"While Agatha Christie movies are usually very good, I'm afraid that these titles appeared during the 1980's, which was not particularly an apt time to use Joan Hickson. She's a remarkable actress, but clearly quite old at this time. I still think there's quite a bit of merit in these titles, but I don't suggest you use this series as a hallmark to your collection. Mind you, Magaret Rutherford's Agatha Christie collection is worth adding to your collection, despite her age during the course of the series."
3,"Great Miss Marple, Bad A&E","A delightful collection of Miss Marple classics, with excellent sets and period design. Excellent direction and wonderfully adapted texts. The only thiing which prevents me from giving this set a full five stars is the poor sound quality (the original titles having been shot in actual English locations and not in sets). The absences of subtitles is also a downfall for those of us who are hearing impaired. Other than this flaw, Joan Hickson delivers an impeccable Marple and the supporting cast are, in general, outstanding. This set is well worth the money."
4,Good but not great,"I'm a fan of some of Christie's Miss Marple books, and I have to say that these A&E adaptations do a good job of capturing the slow, methodical pace of them. That doesn't necessarily make for great movies, in most cases, and it doesn't help that the screenplays are not all that artful, but the acting is fairly competent throughout and the stories remain enjoyable in these adaptations. ""The Mirror Crack'd,"" perhaps the most famous, is also the best in this collection. Overall a good purchase if you enjoy languid British mysteries and old ladies being smarter than everyone else around them."
4,Joan HIckson Miss Marple collections- NO CAPTIONS,"Marple: The Classic Mysteries Collection (Caribbean Mystery / 4:50 from Paddington / Moving Finger / Nemesis / At Bertram's Hotel / Murder at Vicarage / Sleeping Murder / They Do It with Mirrors / Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side)The Joan Hickson Miss Marple collections that I bought through Amazon are outstanding -- except for the lack of Closed Captions (for the Deaf and Hearing Impaired). I am disappointed by this arrogant lapse, no doubt to save the producers money. The aging population is growing, and I am one of many loathe to purchase any DVD without captions. Please pass on this complaint to the producers of all Joan Hickson Miss Marple collections, and all DVDs in general. Thank you."
3,i heart solas,"hi guys- i love solas and i think they are an awesomely cool group of wicked good musicans. so about this newish cd, it was good but i think some of the songs were kinda pop ish. like the ones with the guy singing it was not really what they used 2 do. i think compared to the edge of silence cd it was not as good, but edge of silence was the best.. buy it if u dont have it!!! also see this band in concert cause they r amazing!! get up and dance- it makes it way cooler!love u guys!(solas i mean) bye-"
3,The sound of a band coming apart,"This album is musically incoherent, to my ears. Electric guitars, rock songs, drum kits, huh? It appears that the various band members each chose a couple numbers and paid no attention to how the mess would sound when it was put together. For too much of the CD, Dierdre Scanlan and Winifred Horan are absent. I loved their last album and really like their first three. I'll stick to those."
1,Misleading item description,Product description did not disclose that the item did NOT have a Myreaderlab.com access code. Would not have purchased if they had properly described the item.
1,I received an old book edition 1,"Pleased to find a used book here which is not used on the class, and I have to order another book again. Sad!After calling the sell, I got some discount back.It is an experience! I recommend every one shopping here, be careful of what you want to buy here, go through all the details of description, especially on those used products.:-("
4,Pretty good,"This book offers a good basis for learning skills necessary for successful reading, especially academic reading. The end of chapter readings offer a good cross selection of topics."
1,Bridging the Gap/ Brenda Smith,This book needs to be worded differently. I think it is a waste of money having to take this class for an entire semester.
2,Land Sores!,"Most of the houses in this book look like what I would call a Land Sore. Horrid looking pieces of plastic and steel rising from the earth. Not very pretty.There are two reasons I am giving this book two stars and not just one.The book earns it's first star for the reason that there is a few (3) nice building shapes in this book. The problem with them though is that they are covered with the ugliest material inside and out that you could imagine.The book earns it's second star by a short section on domes at the end of the book. These domes have some amazingly nice wood work in them.If your curious about the domes get this book from your library. If you go and buy the book and hate it, don't say I didn't warn you!"
4,Father's Day,I purchased this as a gift and it is used often. I was satisfied with the service and the condition the watering can arrived in.
1,Not Worth 2 Dollars I Paid At Local Store,I purchased this today from a local store for $2.00. Using it with the sprinkler head didn't work as the water runs down the outside of the spout and all over your shoes etc. Next you need to be careful where you sit it as it the leaves a small pool of water. If a person is planning on using it without the sprinkler head it may be okay. I don't think it's worth the $2.00 I paid for it.
1,Garbage is free and for everyone,"I read a great of this trash-book, on internet.It is available for free reading on an internet site.The author was a priest and then, a protestant pastor, during XIX Century, in United States.Even knowing the ""machism"" at his time, even so, this book renains bad and ridiculous.Is very fun the author claiming the link, between Roman catholicism and poverty.Well, today after more than 120 years after this trash-book be published, more than 60% of the most rich countries in the World are Roman catholics.Here in Brazil and in fact in 100% of Latin America, there's no other religious group more poor, than the protestants(pentecostals).Except when they are pastors and bishops such as the ""Bispo('Bishop') Macedo"", almost ever big fortune in Brazil is a catholic, jewish, etc. fortune.In fact, here in Brazil , there's a joke claiming that:A poor + a bible = A pentecostal.Please, don't waste your time following ridiculous ideas and bigoted men, living in XIX Century."
5,Classic,The quintessential Filipino dish made easy and tasty with classic reliable Noh quality. We always have Noh products in our pantry.
2,When a decent DVD-release?,"Good thing about a companies like Alpha is that they release movies that aren't available on a DVD by the major companies who originally released the movie. Bad thing about Alpha is, that the quality of the movies on their DVD's leaves much to be desired. For instance ""Peck's bad boy"", a movie I loved when I first saw it on TV years ago, has a soundtrack that doens't have a clear sound, which is the cause that some of the dialogue is impossible to understand. The last reel of the movie on this DVD is very bad, with pieces missing.Also the movie on the DVD is a 'blown up' version, probably to avoid showing the brand of a company that broadcasted this movie on TV.Alpha calls this DVD-release a 'special edition'. God knows why, because there's nothing special at all about it. Let's hope that some of the true gemms which still haven't been released by a major company and are only available by Alpha etc., will one day get a decent release in good quality."
4,Good product,"Good product, easy to install. The only negative is a crackling sound that I hear when I close the windows tight. I removed and inspected the shields and nothing is being damaged. Just gets tight when the window is closed. I plan to buy anothe set for the car."
1,"Extremist, sexist and inaccurate","I was raised as n orthodox woman practicing all the laws of modesty. Rabbi Falk's book represents an extreme view on the laws and is not accepted among many Orthodox Rabbis. His cause-and-effect relationship, as another reviwer called it, between a woman's modesty and ill-fate is not a belief held by the Orthodox and is fundamentally sexist and offensive.If you are interested in studying Jewish modesty, I strong recommend you do not use this book as your guide. Something less ethnocentric, more balanced and accurate would give you a better idea of the subject."
3,Best replacement cable ever to hit the PS2,I Use this cable as a replacement cable for my PS2 its great!! The high-quality durable insulation is great doesn't heat up with long time use. if your looking to use your PS2 on a HDTV the S-video section of the cable work extremely well with just about any HDTV.
4,Beautiful small brush,"This brush is green, not blue. It is very beautiful and well made. The size is too small for me to use as a travel brush so I bought it for my daughter. I rated this brush as I did, becauseit is a tad expensive for the size and is not static free."
2,I'm not smart enought to understand this book,"The jacket and review seemed promising, but this book is too academic for a working-class man. Getting thru the book was difficult for me, but I was able to get a few of the authors points. Dogs That Know When Their Owners Are Coming Home was much more engaging."
3,Bug off is a fun family film,"When i got this film i thought that it would be a bit silly, however when i watched it i was supprised of how funny it actually was. This is a film that will keep you to your seat, it is about a brother and sister who are always arguing so the sister makes a wish that he was a bug. Without knowing the consequences this happens and soon in time his sister relizes just how much she loves her brother and wishes he wasn't an insect anymore."
4,cute family movie,BUG OFF....ME AND MY DAUGHTER WATCH THIS TOGETHER. IT WAS FUNNY AND A GOOD FAMILY MOVIE. Aliens where too funny.
5,Pure Enjoyment!!!,"I loved this book. It had spicey love scenes and tragedy all under one cover!!! I recomend this book to anyone who loves a good romance. The heroine, although young is spunky, and a little spitfire and the hero.. what a hunk. He is the dark handsome stranger that you always dream of. In this book Justin, just cant heep his hands off Megan even though he tries and Megan seduces Justin with her beauty and youth. She ends up pregnant and in trouble in Regency England and tries to make a bad situation into a good one by accepting a proposal from another gentleman. Even though it hurts Justin enough to take her away he can't marry her because he is already married (to a prudish cod fish of a woman). Everything turns out beautiful in the end after a tragedy pulls Justin and Megan appart then eventually closer than ever...(I will not tell you the tragedy it would ruin the suprise). Read on this one is a great one!!!"
2,Twisted love story...,"Too many issues here. I was slightly uncomfortable with the storyline of ""guardian and underage minor fall in love"". It was one thing when he was fighting his attraction and succumbed to temptation...but, when he became controlling and abusive - I lost all interest in the book. When you no longer like the ""hero"", it's hard to like the book. I've enjoyed a lot of Robards' work, just not this one."
4,Shelved For Life,"This book may be liked by some and hated by others. However this book is one that will remain on my bookshelf for always. Justin is indeed a Aries type of man. A man's man if you will. He likes things done his way, and exactly when and how he says for them to be done. While away from his wife who he can't seem to stand he act's almost normal. However when he returns to England with Megan in tow he resorts to a non-caring attitude in front of his wife. He argues with Megan over sometimes trivial things. Good thing she will stand up for herself once in a while. I would of slapped the man on more than one occasion.If you can get past a few minor errors in exact period, a strained relationship, age difference, and a brutish guy then this book is one you can at least take a stab at reading. Old school h.romance at it's best. When men were dominating and women didn't speak up enough. lol."
2,Not My Cup of Tea,"I was disappointed. I can never get into a married-to-someone- else/cheating on a spouse main character--too many years of Catholic school or one too many times being hit on with the ""my wife doesn't understand me"" line. II know it is highly unlikely that any hetero male over the age of 30 would never have been married but, if I wasn't a sucker for the totally impractical love-will-overcome-everything storyline I would read something else."
1,Don't Bother,"If you want a jerk of a hero, a silly heroine, rape, abduction, lots of Big Misunderstandings, and ""I hate you let's go to bed"" screaming and shrieking, by all means go for it. But for $6.50, it's not worth it.The only reason I read this is because I thought the book was new. Next time I'll look closely at publication dates!"
2,Disappointed,"Not one for the library unfortunately. I haven't read this to the end and just want to finish it, to see if it ever redeems itself. I feel that it's one love story that need not have been told. I realise that the era is when age differences between men and women were the norm, but Justin seems cruel and abusive and I can't see how Megan would fall for someone like this."
4,I just loved this,"I am a big Karen Robards fan, especially of her historical romances and this did not disappoint. Loved it. Classic love story. Worth the read."
5,like witney my love,loved this book it had tension and fast paced didnt have sb wanting to murder anyone as all do and generally reminded me of witney my love which i loved too
2,What Happened to Justin?,"Justin, the hero of this book, starts out as a relatively likable guy. However, in the second half of the book he suddenly becomes a selfish and jelous jerk. He dosn't even try to understand Megan's situation and behaves like a spoiled child. I think Megan should have dumped Justin and found a real man and one that wasn't twenty years older than her as well."
5,"LOVE A DARK, BROODING, DOMINANT HERO & A BODICE-RIPPER TOO !","An alluring story of unbridled passion, young love, betrayal, a real page-turner & what a turn on ! The huge gap in age reminded me a bit of Jane Feather's characters. So what if Justin is cruel & heartless on the outside ? He's only embracing his belief that if he can't have Megan, no one can either. Just my kind of hero, a tortured soul, he put his heart up on his sleeves & came roaring back when he couldn't have her anymore. He did what his desperate mind told him to do, the only way to bind Megan to him is by kidnapping her. A rape is too harsh a description (Mrs. giggles' review) for Justin's lovemaking to the reluctant-but-as-much-in-love Megan. I just wish there were more authors as magnificent as Ms. Robards out there. Plenty of heart-pounding battles of will & toes-curling sex with an ending that'll leave U sniffling for a box of kleenex !"
5,Where it all begins,"I suppose it is typical for a first release to be under-appreciated and, perhaps more importantly, under-promoted. ""Dinosaur"" was originally released by small label Homestead Records, so this was expected.This is a great album (yeah, I know it's not really an album you little whippersnappers). It's stacked with great songs. There are maybe two songs that I sort of endure, but even those are significant works of art. Mascis doesn't play ""Severed Lips"" live very often unfortunately, it's the best song there imho.This release is an essential part of any Dinosaur Jr collection."
5,Oh my goodness!!,"I just received it and had my first viewing. I had forgotten the energy she exuded. That voice is absolutely incredible. Everything about that performance was so very....Liza!! Her haircut, her eyelashes, her nails, her exuberance. The bonuses are fun,too. I still have some more watching to do. I am so glad to have this in my possession again."" It's Liza with a Z, not Lisa with an S cause Lisa with an S goes ssssssssssss not zzzzzzzzz""...it all came right back to me. What a performer."
5,fosse & minnelli are super great!,the combination of bob fosse and Liza is super great. the dancers are great. every song shows liza as a different character and yet so much herself. it's a movie of a concert and -- strangely -- has not dated.
5,Liza with a BANG!,"This dvd should be viewed in masterclasses as a spectacular and unmatchable show that reveals what a immensly talented lady Liza is. I cant wait until i receive this, truly a gem of a collaboration between Minnelli, Bob Fosse, Halston, Fred Ebb,and John Kander. A piece of American showbusiness history."
4,Liza with extra ZZZZZzzzzzzzzz.....,"This rare TV concert is a great collector's piece. The video quality is good at best, although the ""advertising hype"" insists that it's beautiful. It is a film transfer and has been cleaned beautifully [de-speckled], but at the expense of crispness. I find some of the additional ""bonus"" material boring. Still it's a definite ""keeper."" The extra footage from a deleted section [Mein Herr] is a treat to watch and apparently has not been ""cleaned,"" maybe on purpose, so that we can see what the original aging film looked like before restoration, which I heard took on-and-off ... six years to complete. The A&E; segment puts me to sleep, the GLAAD Awards stuff is so-so, but the Liza and John Kander chatting piece is interesting.A CD, ""Liza with a Z,"" accompanies the DVD in this edition. I have not listened to it yet but when I do... it will be nice to hear it without all those ticks and pops [my vinyl record from 30 years ago]."
5,liza with a Z,"Nothing like it lately, nor probably ever again. It makes you forget your troubles, as it were and get happy!"
5,"""Liza with a Z"" dazzles, sizzles, and amazes!!!!!!!","There is no doubt that Liza Minelli is the greatest entertainer in the world! This show proves it! She can sing.. she can dance.. she can make you cry... she can make you laugh... all the emotions from A to Z ! If you are a Liza fan you have to have this album! It is timeless! Choreography and direction by the great Bob Fosse, costumes by Bob Mackie, and arrangements by Marvin Hamlisch ... and last but not least the wonderful music of Kander and Ebb blend together to make a delicious concoction of pure joy! I just loved this show! It is as fresh today as it was then... It is such a pity that they do not put shows on the air like this anymore . One of the bonus features is a taping of the forum at the Toronto Film Festival. Liza is real hoot with her anecdotes and reminiscenses of Bob Fosse . I love that there is a CD of the show alsoThis DVD/CD will delight you for years to come! BUY IT!!!!"
5,delightful! enchanting! no one else like her!!,"I remember this concert, altho a young girl, but I just recieved my copy today and words can not express the feelings that come from watching Liza , she is wonderful and exciting. It is a must have dvd. if you don't have it yet ,don't miss out . there are no words to express how wonderful it is . She is one of a kind ."
3,OVER-HYPED,"It was a nice concert, but JEEZ...the way it's being hyped & marketed is so over-the-top. ""The night a star became a legend..."" Now c'mon! I love Liza, and I'm a fan, but this is just a bit silly. She was a terrific young performer doing a nice concert. There was NOTHING ""legendary"" about it. I saw the concert on Showtime, and enjoyed it. Since I've seen it, I think I can save my $20."
5,"Liza with a ""Z""",This was a gift for my wife. The recording was excellent and the bonus material was very interesting. Miss Minnelli is a true artist.
2,disappointing!,"Owning Cabaret and Pippin on dvd,I was really looking forward to the release of Liza with a Z on dvd, to complete my collection of Fosse's grand slam. The video was grainy,and the dolby 5.1 was very disappointing.The dvd was described as widescreen presentation enhanced for 16x9 tv. In fact only ""some"" of the bonus features were on letterbox but still 4:3 aspect ratio,the concert was in 4:3.There should be truth in advertising!"
5,Great Quilt Book,Great book. I liked this book enough to buy a second as a gift. I have made 2 quilts from the book the instructions were very easy to follow. The book is really fun to read. Yummy recipes. Not a book of all brown quilts! Can't wait for her next book.
2,Disappointed,"I purchased this book specifically to make the quilt, 'La Chocolata'. Having just begun to assemble this quilt, I have found the cutting directions both incomplete and inaccurate. As an experienced quilter, I'll be able to correct the errors and figure out the size for the corner triangles, but I shouldn't have to do that."
1,Author didn't check her work.,"I've been quilting for 9 years and have yet to find a book with so many mistakes. Directions have you cutting too much of some fabric and not enough of others. Then as you are piecing, again the directions are wrong; well at least the figures. Don't pay any attention to the figures as you sew, pay attention to the final pictures, at least they're right. Seems like the author and editors should have double checked the work a little better."
3,Quilting and Baking,"This quilting book (paperback format) uses basic quilting shapes (squares, triangles and some applique) so there are no new techniques. The sizes of the quilts are quite manageable (lap size which is my preference) and each project also has a chocolate recipe to go along with it. It is written with easy and complete instructions; no guessing needed. Though I have not yet tried any of the projects, they should go together fairly quickly. Personally I would make different color choices but that is what quilting is all about. Recipes could also tempt you to be indulgent."
2,No Pressing Instructions???,After I cut out all the pieces for the My Heart Belongs to Chocolate quilt I discovered that there are no pressing instructions for this quilt and it REALLY needs them! One of the main reason I buy patterns is so I don't have to spend time figuring out things like pressing instructions. I won't buy any more books from this author.
3,Real chocolate has more taste,"The title and concept assured them that every quilter would at least stop and look at this book. I know chocolate is brown, but did the surrounding fabrics all have to be tones and shades? Four of the quilts are so filled with busy, medium value prints that you have to look at the diagram to really see the design. In my opinion, the quilt that best interprets the theme is My Heart Belongs to Chocolate. It is the last project, but the one that clearly looks like a yummy box of gourmet candy.The directions are clear, illustrated well and presented in an easy-to-follow format. Adding interest are the little snippets about chocolate in the margins and the recipes for each baked good supposedly recreated by a quilt."
5,A synopsis of all the great things there are in life!,"""Green City in the Sun"" is not a book about Africa. It is not about successful women in a male dominated environment. And it is not about culture and race. ""Green City in the Sun"" combines all these elements skillfullfy, strong and persuasive but tender and insightful. It makes you want to pack a bag and move to Kenya"
5,Great Book,"This is the first book I have read from Barabara Wood and it will definately be added to my favorite list. It seems very long, but flows very smoothly and takes you through several generations. I could barely put it down."
4,"Nice, but...","I liked the book very muy, although it is too long. The last 100 pages could have been left out, in my opinion. Please notice that there are some rather explicit erotic scenes in de book."
3,Not bad...,"Not a bad story about women in the sex trade - For this type of flim, the story is not as key as the action,"
4,about the DVDfilm/movie confession of a lap dancer,"This title is also known as illicit confession which basically talk about the actress lose custody of her daughter by law after she worked in soeme kind of business that is dealing with lap dancing, striptease and she also sells her backside (about four scenes) and later she turn over a new life after she decide to stay permanent with one actor in this movie and she able to get back her daughter in the end. (a big chunk of lap dancing and some onstage striptease show). Recommended to those whom are interested in this genre of film......Confessions of a Lap DancerReview written by:Dr, MR Franc MBBS (PhD) GPS Ang Poon Kah"
3,EVERYONE CAN CHANGE.,"This dvd is a little mature materals, however, the story in it is very interesting. It shows that no matter how nasty or wicked you are, you can change your life if you choose to."
3,This is another FLIPPY,This is a fine film and high quality DVD but for one major flaw; it is a flippy. That is you must turn the thing over half way through. Why must they do that?
3,"Great Movie, But...","I must say that this is a great movie; great cast, great story, great direction. I do think it sad and annoying though that in this technilogical day and age, that I have to get up and turn the disc over after about an hour or so, just to see the rest of the movie. Come on Warner Brothers, you can do a better job than that; and with this movie you should!I would only recommend this movie with the advisory that YOU DO HAVE TO GET UP FROM YOUR COMFORTABLE SEAT TO TURN THE DISC OVER IF YOU WANT TO SEE THE WHOLE MOVIE!!!!!!"
4,VERY GOOD,"I read the book and was pleased with the movie. Very pleased. It captured the essence of the book without being too glosy (like a Time to Kill) or straying too far from the source material (like The Firm).Julia Roberts is terrific - so emotionally accessible and convincing as a brillant law student. Denzel Washington is solid - they have some nice chemistry. Also impressive is the supporting cast - I liked the score.Why does it get 4 stars? This DVD is one where you must flip over the disc to watch the last 50 minutes. This is a joke. Not only did this movie make nearly $200 million worldwide, but it got favorable reviews.Warner Bros. needs to re-release the picture just for the fact that I want to watch the movie without having to flip the disc over. It is the year 2005 afterall."
5,Pelican Brief,"This movie was very entertaining. It had the right amount of action, suspense and excitement. I recommend this movie on a rainy night to enjoy."
2,The Pelican Brief,"Living in the area, I love to view the scenery and enjoy the atmosphere of New Orleans so I never get tired of looking at The Pelican Brief. I even have friends that appear as ""extras"" in this movie. I am extremely disappointed in the DVD. It has to be truned over to view the second half of the movie."
5,Pelican Brief--Super Addition to Our DVD Library,"We have a big ""library"" of VHS movies. We do, of course, want to trade them out for the sharper DVD, but because of the cost, we have been in no hurry. You have made it possible to to go ahead and build up our DVD library faster because of the excellent new or like-new movies you offer at such great low prices. Now we have a beautiful copy of another of our favorites--Pelican Brief! Glad to do business with such reliable sellers."
3,Good Suspense,"Darby Shaw (Julia Roberts) is a law student at Tulane who writes her own theory about who arranged for the assassination of two Supreme Court justices and why. The unfortunate thing is, her theory is right on the money, and once it starts circulating it results in a number of deaths. Investigative reporter Gray Grantham (Denzel Washington) turns out to be the one person she can trust and rely on.""The Pelican Brief"" is a solid and entertaining (if lengthy) political / newspaper / legal thriller from the director of ""All The President's Men"". It keeps its grip thanks to genuinely good film-making and an excellent cast. The climax is reasonably suspenseful.Engrossing plot typical of Grisham, but for me the closing scene makes this movie. It's so much more dramatic than just having Darby and Gray ride off into the sunset together."
2,Great Movie-Bad Disc Setup (two-sided),Great movie. My only complaint is you have to turn it over about half-way through the movie. It does not tell you that in the description. I wouldn't have bought it if it were described correctly. Normally don't read review on movies I like. Will do that in the future.
4,Don't Buy This One!,"Don't get me wrong it is a good movie worth watching. The problem is not with the movie it is the cheap studio that released it on DVD. It is a flipper! If you do not know what i flipper is, it is when the studio rather than using dual layers to fit the entire movie on one side of the disc choose to break the movie into two parts so that to finish watching the movie you have to get up from you comfortable spot on the couch to flip the disc over to finsh watching it. So unless you enjoy the little exercise you get from having to do this wait until the re-release it proper."
4,Perennial faavorite,"When you need a film with a decent plot, good acting and directing, this is a great fall back. Dated to be sure but reliable"
4,enjoyed the story...,The movie was great...but the stopping for more downloading was irritating... averaged it was 4 stars...but I wish it would have a smoother download with uninterrupted viewing.
3,not like book,Good movie almost follows book I really enjoyed the cast as while reading the I heard about the movie and the faces fit
4,DVD,good movie. ends so abruptly that I thought the dvd was messed up. ordered another dvd and it was the same.
3,Problem with DVD,The only objection I have to this DVD is that you have to turn it over half way through the movie to see it all!
4,Great movie but why do I have to flip it?,Great story by John Grisham and acting with Julia Roberts and Denzel Washington. It will keep you sitting on the edge of your seat at least until you have to flip the DVD over to finish it. That's right they couldn't fit this on one side for some odd reason. At first I thought something was wrong with my DVD player or the DVD. Only when I took out the DVD and saw Side A and Side B did I realize. They could have at least put a message at the end of Side A for you to turn it over. Otherwise a great DVD. The chase to track down a story about a gangster that conributed to the Presidents campaign fund and how a legal brief ties it together is very well done. I would wait to buy it on DVD when they put Widescreen on one side and Standard on the other rather than have a Side A and B.
3,Mediocre political thriller.,"""The Pelican Brief"" was alright, but it was nowhere near as good as other political conspiracy films. The dialogue was 50/50: half of it was interesting; half just seemed like B.S. Grisham filler material.I might have liked the movie a little more if it wasn't for that god-awful, nails-on-chalkboard, dramatic music that pops up every ten minutes.Washington, Lithgow, and Roberts have all done films ten times better than this one, and it seems like they were harvested to salvage a crummy script based on an even crummier book.But that's just my opinion."
5,The Pelican Brief,A young female law student endangers her own life while solving one of the most significant crimes in history. I enjoyed the script and acting of this movie a lot. It's very fast paced with the delivery of it's lines and dialogue. Roberts and Washington have good chemistry in this movie. This is the kind of movie which really get people thinking.
3,So this is what it looks like!,"The Pelican Brief was released on DVD many years ago. The DVD was a bit muddy and flat, among many other faults. The new Blue-Ray is a good example of how a movie that is only so-so in quality can still be a very enjoyable view. The move to BRD didn't improve the movie, which is a mashup of All the Presidents Men and the George Bush administration. However, the presentation is very good with clear sound and clean video."
2,"One Movie, Two Sides","There are some movies I can see needing two discs. The Lord of the Rings for example. Very long movie... two discs. Okay. The Pelican Brief? Really? It's less than 2.5 hours? Can't fit it all on one side of the disc? I know of many a three hour movie that all fit just fine on one disc, one side.I like the movie well enough, I guess, but I don't know if it's worth the hassle of flipping the disc over."
2,Good acting + Far-fetched plot + Not suspenseful = Below average,"Denzel's and Julia's acting are good but they can save the film.The plot is far-fetched. The movie is not suspenseful. Overall, it's below average"
2,"Read the book, pass on the movie","This wasn't a horrible movie, but it was a very forgettable interpretation of a decent book. I'm a fan of John Grisham, Denzel Washington and Julia Roberts, but this film isn't worth owning. Especially since you have to TURN IT OVER halfway through the movie. I mean, c'mon, they fit a classic like 'Lawrence of Arabia' on a single side of a disc, and that is a nearly 4 hour epic. 3 out of 5 stars for the movie, minus 1 for the two-sided disc."
3,Better if I hadn't read the book,This was a good movie. I just didn't enjoy it near as much as the book. I probably would have liked it better if I hadn't read the book. You can definitely tell it is an older movie.
5,birthday gift,I have been looking for this DVD for my brothers birthday gift. I received it in plenty of time for his birthday. Very happy with seller and will order from them again
2,Pelican Brief,It's a great movie that I've seen before and bought it to have my husband watch it. But there was a problem two thirds of the way through the movie and it stopped working. Very disappointing.
2,Anyone/anything would have been better,"Ok- so I can see there are some die-hard Julia Roberts fans out there. Too bad. Just raving about her will never improve her acting skills (an oxymoron). Actually, the poor quality of this movie is astounding, considering its director, the cast (excepting our girl Julia) and the book upon which it was based. Though he's done some much better work, when Pakula threw this film together he was clearly thinking of only one thing: ""Hmm, 'Presumed Innocent' was a winner. Let's follow that same formula and do another one. It'll sell."" Unfortunately, by the time the story from the book by John Grisham got to the screen, it lacked any of its original punch. As for Denzel, he should be ashamed of himself. He's about as enthusiastic in this as a turtle heading for the beach. I guess he probably needed the cash for another house. Then again, he's opposite Julia. No further comment needed -other than, save your money."
1,You have to turn it over!!,"I bought this DVD 5 years ago, in 2006, and was dismayed to find you have to get up and turn the disc OVER in order to view the second half of the movie. I was disappointed then.... hugely.... But I LOVE the movie, so I bought it again in 2011, b/c the back of it says ""dual layered"" - I asked the sales staff what that means, specifically, does this mean ""two sided"" so I'll have to turn it over, just like the one I bought in 2006... they said, ""no"" that's not what it means.But lo and behold, you STILL have to turn it over to see the last half of the movie.Ridiculous. Unpleaseant viewing experience. Who ever heard of such a thing in 2011??? Total rip off.WHEN will they create a version of this movie that you don't have to turn over???? I love the movie, but can't find a copy to put in and view like all other movies. CRAZY."
1,The Pelican Brief(saw it on tube),"Saw this on the 'Tube,pretty boring and usual envrionwhacko conspiracy type plot and bad corporation,good citizen defending the ""wetlands"" and nature.Conservationists ironically can only conserve Nature and nothing else in Human Form,The rights of The plants and animals trump Humans.Shame that Roberts and Denzel both good actors were in it."
4,"Not Everything, but Not a Nothing.","To sum this up quickly this is a highly engaging political drama not a romance or action.It has a relatively good plot: A few quite good twists and a few predictable ones. It maybe a thriller in places, but it's not really an action. My last complaint I have about the movie is Julia Roberts is an actress I have come to know as a romance actress, but this movie really didn't have any romance. Although Julia and Denzel Washington still did turn out an excellent performance. It's not a movie with everything, but the stuff it has is done very well."
1,Bad Disc,"This disc is the same kind that I bought twice at wal-mart and had to take it back twice because it would stop in the middle of the movie. When you look at the disc it looks like a ""boot leg"" disc. After swapping it twice at Wal-Mart, I decided I would be safe and order from Amazon. It was the same case, and the same looking disc and again, it stopped in the same place as the other two I had purchased from Wal-mart. It does not have anything on the front of the disc except in small letters around the hole ""Pelican Brief"". There is no picture or anything else on the disc. I love shopping on Amazon and this is the first time I have ever been disappointed.I never write a review....but this time I am so frustrated that I felt others should know................"
2,needed romance,listen hollywood when you put two of the most important faces in hollywood together you need to showcase all aspects of them.the story is okay but because of hollywood's interracial hangup's this film never sizzles like it should.
2,5 star movie - less than 1 star Blu-ray,"I had this on my wish list until I found out that the movie was split on a two-sided disc. I simply won't buy ANY movie that is split unless it is VERY long, which this one isn't. This is a disappointment, since ""The Pelican Brief"" is one of my favorite movies."
4,Why did I wait so long,"Ok, let's start by saying that I was too young when this movie came out, to be able to truly appreciate it. However, I do not know why I waited so long to actually sit down and watch it. It's a good flick."
5,Classic show - you watch it again and again.,"I had this show in DVD and like it so much I ordered it again in Blue Ray because we got a new player. Julia Robert, Denzel Washington and John Grisham - how could you go wrong!"
1,Only half the movie,There was only half the movie on the DVD. Wouldn;t play anymore. Very Disappointing. I purchased as a Christmas gift. Bummer
1,Very Disappointing,"It's hard to believe someone would actually sell an item like this one (I'd be too embarrassed). To be watched in its entirety, this DVD must be turned over in the middle of the film. What a piece of garbage!"
1,DVD not the good deal your think it is,"I didn't think I would ever figure out that you had to turn the DVD over to finish the movie!!!! This is the most mickey-mouse thing I have seen. You can't put a whole, simple movie on one side of a DVD? If it has to be this way, tell people up front that halfway through a movie you have to stop and turn the DVD over.I'm very displeased - would never have bought this had I known it was this mickey-mouse. Would have liked to have known this before purchasing as I would not have purchased. It is not an extra long movie, it is only 141 mins long."
4,Good Condition...,is a two sided dvd... i mudt hqave not read the description very well .. i dont like two sided dvds but product itself was just fine
1,Hope for the Untalented,"If you have yet to listen to anything by The Residents, congratulations! You have not been forced to endure virtual manure in an audio form. To compare this blare with musicians like FZ, Beef (whether it's the Captain or Sleepy La), et. al. is like saying that the reason people yawn is because they are trying to be sexually attractive.For those uninitiated, step away from the browser. Find the power cord for your computer, grab the cord and pull as hard as you can.There's still time to save yourself."
2,Listen before you buy,Thank God for the Internet. Without it unsuspecting souls would buy all sorts of music not meant for their ears. This album is one of them. I recommend this only to those who are bored with music made by musicians.
5,BRILLIANT,"There are many elements that make up great music, one of which is raw unbridled creativity. This album is the quintessential example of how, with the right minds, minimal musical skill can be harnessed to create something truly beautiful and fascinating. Everything the Residents do is worth hearing, most of it is great, but this album stands out as...well, it just stands out. Listen to it. Buy it. Play it for your friends."
5,Rey Reyna: Piensalo Bien,"Track Listing:1. Mi Tejanita2. Piensalo Bien3. Mi Soledad4. Confianza5. Cuidad Mi Amor6. Peadoname7. Te Sigo Esperando8. Dime La Verdad9. Voy A Cambiar10. Novia Mir Del Alma[Disclaimer: The track list for this album is provided as a courtesy, because at the time of this listing, there were no song titles available on this page, for this title. We feel that you should be aware of what songs are on this album before making your purchase. Enjoy!]"
2,KIDS ONLY,"The back cover states that the author wrote a regular column for ""Boy's Life"" magazine, and that gives a hint as to what age level this book is intended for. While it may be a good resource for strictly amateur, ""among friends"" or one-time variety show material, it's not what I would consider a valuable reference."
2,First Edition???,"For First Edition collectors, a first edition already HAS a meaning. This will just add to the confusion of finding genuine First Editions in our web searches. This publicity stunt should be rejected. This isn't even a facsimile edition of the First Edition."
2,??,"Probably needed for a balanced education, along with Sun Tzu.. But I don't recommend living this way.Include some Quaker readings to give balance from the other side."
4,Simply Machiavellian,"I don't think this is a 'must read', but it was pretty entertaining if you're into philosophy, history or like to find out where words come from. You always hear people say, things like ""his politics are machiavellian"" and you know it means 'cut-throat', but you don't know why. Well reading this clears it up, although I didn't get the impression that he favored such tactics, it just happened that sometimes those tactics work for maintaining power and this is what this book is all about. Getting, keeping and expanding your power, specifically over principalities, but you can apply some things to business I'm sure.It's an easy read (which surprised me) and not very lengthy, so don't be intimated by it if you're interested in reading it."
5,The extraordinary tale of the dinosaur tree,"Don't be put off by the 1-star reviewer. This is a wonderful movie, not only for the breathtaking country of the Blue Mountains, but also for the astounding story of the discovery of the Wollemi Pine. Best seen at the IMAX, but pretty impressive on a large-screen TV."
4,So much Cooler !!!,"I have had the Weathertech WeatherFlectors for about two weeks. Wow! My Blazer is so much cooler when I get in in the afternoon. Best of all, I no longer have to worry about it raining and my Blazer getting wet because I left the windows open slightly(which has happened numerous times). These were so easy to install, I thought I was doing something wrong. Installed quickly and stayed put. I down graded them one star due to slight imperfection in the plastic in one spot and some small scratches due to poor packaging. WORD OF ADVICE: GET THE LIGHTLY TINTED ONES. They will match the factory window tinting perfectly and blend right in with the window plus they are easy to see thru at night. Bottom line: BUY THEM!!!"
2,Could have been better....,"My children love Arthur, but this game was a disappointment. There are only 5 games and they are not all math related. My 6 year old daughter liked it for a few days and then grew bored of it; my 4 year old still enjoys it. I only paid $4 for it so not bad for that price."
3,DEP + Neurosis,"All the Dillinger Escape Plan-meets-Neurosis comparisons are basically on point. This band has the jazzy bass runs and angular math riffs of the former, with occasional moody/doomy moments like the latter. Much of the album is long on fury but short on punch. Eerie, slower material such as ""The Sense of Reverence"" is more effective. The lavishly creepy packaging, while illegible, adds much atmosphere."
5,Noise-core uh huummmmm.....,"Yes, its the noise-core that will make you a lover of this genre. I woulnd go as far as sayin luddite clone sounds like the end but yea their also noisecore the other bands are simuler i quess but welll the end has their own sound and its very much original."
5,Now this is great!!!,"This is the next CD I'll buy. Definately.It fills that emptiness that Dillinger Escape Plan left in my noise/mathcore hungry soul. All their music is furious and chaotic like everything DEP did before Miss Machine but these guys have their own developed originality. Beautiful.I can't believe those people saying that Dillinger is adding more variety to their sound because, in fact, their sound has become more accessible and not much complex anymore. This change is pitiful for those with ""trained ears"".If you're looking for something that can stand side to side with your Calculating Infinity CD, this is the album you need. THIS is variety, THIS is complex and NOT THAT mainstream directed garbage DEP presented us this year.For the TRUE fans of post-hardcore or mathcore or noisecore, whatever ...core. Within Dividia is beautiful and original.[...]"
4,Really tight Alt/Rock,"I first bought this album after seeing the video for California on MTV. Remember when MTV showed videos... and they weren't hip hop videos? Anyhow, at first listen, I hated it. I liked 2 songs and promptly set it aside. From time to time, I'd throw California on a mix tape, but that was about it. Then one day, I was going thru my cd collection and noticed that the case was empty, which made me want to listen to it real bad. Luckily, I found it for $0.49 in a used bin at FYE. Talk about a kick ass deal for 1 song. So, I brought it home and listened to California. I loved it like I always did. Then I tried out the rest of the album again. And it rocks. It reminds me of Weezer and some Pixies and a little bit of Dinosaur Jr. Basically, it's noisy punk rock. It definitely takes more than one listen to appreciate it, but it's worth the extra time."
1,Plagiarism,Black California: The History of African Americans in the Golden State is a well-written overview of African Americans in California but this can be attributed to the fact that Wheeler plagiarized the majority of his material. Entire paragraphs in Wheeler book have been taken from others... I think it is sad that Wheeler stole the words of others and therefore do not recommend his work.
5,Upstairs Downstairs: The Premiere Season,"This is the first season of UPSTAIRS, DOWNSTAIRS, possibly the best loved drama series ever made. The quality of this boxed set is wonderful, and the first thirteen episodes do a first rate job in setting up the plots and characters. We see the Bellamy family and their loyal servants from November 1903 to June 1909 in all their triumphs and tragedies. Of the 13 episodes, my personal favorites are THE MISTRESS AND THE MAIDS, BOARD WAGES, and A CRY FOR HELP. Ironically, these are of the five black and white episodes that have never been shown on American television. The Second and Third seasons are also on video, and I highly recommend them. Unfortunately, the Fourth season that dealt with World War One, and the Fifth Season, which was the last, are not yet available. I hope they come out soon. Finally, Upstairs Downstairs: The Premiere Season is excellent, collect the whole series!"
1,Disappointed in the Quality,"I eagerly awaited these, as I really enjoyed the series years ago. The series was wonderful, but I was very disappointed in the quality of the DVD's. Some are black and white, but my black and white copies showed little explosions of green and red. The sound faded, and was difficult to hear at times. In one of the episodes the figures glowed with an eerie green. I am normally very happy with the quality of A&E DVD's, so the poor quality was a surprise."
3,Story Great - Transfer to DVD disappointing,"No one has to sell me on this story. I've been waiting since dvd first came on the scene. DVD better than Laser Disc (I didn't think it was possible). ""Magic Casements"" episode must have had a chimp in charge of quality control. I had my copy back to the distributor three times with no better results. What I consider poor quality appears in the same places in all the copies I have viewed. To me that says poor quality control. I kept the series anyway because the story is still so good even after almost a third of a century. Expect a good story but not all DVD's are created equal."
1,NO SUBTITLES,my grandma had been asking for this series for sometime and when I finally found it and it said it had english subtitles but when we got it it does not have subtitles AT ALL and we now wasted that money.
4,The perfect gift,Now that I bought these my wife would like complete set .iam so glad that found them . What a great show.Can't wait for next christmas
2,Don't bother,"I purchased this for my son for Christmas. I noticed imediately that the snake's head was never popping off. The tongue of the snake worked properly. The problem with the head seems to be a design flaw. The snake's head is supposed to pop off whenever a car hits this little yellow plastic ""switch"" at the back of the snakes head. The switch enters the track by the snake's head bobbing down and then back up. The switch never seems to fully enter the track. So I went out and got another one. Same problem. Don't bother with this one. Even if the head was working the toy gets really old in no time. Not a lot of excitement past the first three minutes."
4,My 7 year old son loves this track,We bought this for our 7 year old for his birthday and it did take some time to put together but it was worth it - FINALLY a hot wheels set that stays together!!! My only complaint is that it is kinda loud and the cars go really fast (watch your fingers)- so I would not recommend for anyone under 7.
1,Not happy camper,Set it up for two boys - 8 yr old and 4 yr old. Track would not stay together. Very frustrating. One car - accessories fell off on the first try. Great idea but did not work well.We love the octoblast.
3,Too loud and startles young children,"My son, age 4 yrs, was very interested in this track. We purchased it and brought it home to assemble. The noise level when the cars pass through each loop is loud and the cars frequently get stuck in the tunnels that maintain vehicle speed. The noises from this track scared my son and he no longer plays with it. He has a younger sibling who cried when it was in use also. I think we will stick with the tracks that are not as complex."
1,hated it,My 7 year old wanted this and when we brought it home it broke within the week. He is not particularly tough on toys and I found the whole thing cheaply made.
3,Great book that could've been much better,"I've been a fan of Edgar Cayce for many years and even participated in meditation excercises with some A.R.E.members. This book is a great reference for non-traditional healing. Maladies are listed alphabetically and the remedies include many over-the-counter products which were popular in Cayce's time. Some of these are qualified, but many are not. A glossary of these products and suitable substitutions would have made this volume worthy of five stars. As it is, it comes off as an interesting read of old-timey remedies, and, at least for me, triggers thoughts how my grandparents lived and the limited medicine which gave them comfort in another era."
3,Helpful,Didnt read the whole book that is why I only gave it 3 stars. What I read was good and I recommend it to others
1,useless,"I wouldn't even consider this book interesting as fiction. The title is totally misleading, there is no useful health information and I would say that some of the recomendations could even be dangerous."
4,healings through spiritual guides,"Because Edgar Cayce did not remember any of his healings which were conducted while in a trance like condition, his secretary faithfully wrote every word as they were being prescribed. Because of her dedication to him and his work we have accurate and precise records of each healing. Patients would write back or call and tell him of the success of his medical advice and in that way he was able to continue knowing that his ""guides"" were trustworthy. Being interested in herbal healing and believing in the ability of certain people to attune themselves to the ""other world"" and information beyond our present abilities, this collection of just some of Cayce's many healings are educational and remarkable. Cayce had no formal training in medicine allowing his gift as a chairvoyant to help hundreds of people. An interesting book for anyone who wants to learn more about alternative healings and who has an open mind about psychic phenomenon."
4,Ahead of It's Time,"The amazing thing about Edgar Cayce was the range of information presented during his channelings. Not only did he correctly forecast many major historical events, he also suggested various kinds of healing as well as remedies for specific illnesses. This book focuses specifically on Edgar Cayce's theories on health. Presented decades ago, many of his theories concerning healing have currently been given great credence."
5,Add this one,"Add this book to your library. Amazing information form the most influential man of the last 2,000 years."
4,This game ROCKS!,"This game has such realistic graphics it felt like I was on the court!! However, i am very dissapointed that they took out 24/7 mode and that you have like no cap room when you start a Association mode. But all in all this is a great game!!!"
5,outstanding,grandson had so much fun with the game and I was very please with it myself loved every thing about it
2,This Gane Suck For Ps2,When I First Got It I Was Excited To I Played It.It Suck For Ps2 I Got A 360 For Christmas And I Bought 2k7 It Is Amazing For 360 They Got Every Body Moves Like Real Life Unlike PS2.For Example On 360 Vince Carter Can Do His Honey Dip Move When He Put His Whole Arm In The Rim PS2 No Realistic Gameplay.
3,David's review,This is a good game with good grafics and a good shot stick system. But some times it doesn't look right when you make the guy shoot and the crossovers and other things are not as great as the NBA Live series.I rate it three stars because overall it is a goo but not an amazing game
4,Great game but confusing.,"NBA 2k7 is a great game with much improved graphics and very realistic and smooth gameplay. The best part about it is the way it captures the essence of real nba players, like the way shawn marion and kobe bryant and allen iverson shoot in real life they shoot the same way on the game. All the modes are great.However i am confused because the reason i bought it was because of this qoute as one of the features: ""Create your own player and guide him through an elite NBA career - Train him, improve his skills, and outshine your competition to land endorsement deals and your own shoe contract ""Which to me sounded like an awesome mode to play on. But when i bought the game i found the game mode nowhere. ????? AND THERE WAS NO 24/7 which really made me mad since i thought that was the best part of 2k6. So i love the gameplay but i am wondering what the qoute meant.If someone can explain to me please do. I want to know.Over all this is at least as good as NBA live 07."
1,Same Game!!,I can not believe that this game is exactley like the previous year's version. There is no observable upgrades and very little difference in gameplay. No new animation! No intros still! It is just embarrasing to not put in quality work into a new game. Keep NBA 2k6 and upload the rosters would have given you just as much as this game will. I am very disappointed b/c I have not bought NBA Live for years b/c I thought NBA 2K was much better. But this sucks as far as an upgrade from last year!!
5,Great reference,"I found Mr. Poyer's guide very easy to use. The many Appendices, tables and illustrations are an invaluable resource; while it is small enough to carry to shows and auctions."
5,Best book to decode the 1903 Springfield,"I have to agree with all the other reviews of this book simply adding, it's the best book I've seen to decode the 1903 Springfield rifles."
5,Awesome,"Frodo is the coolest Hobbit in all Middle-Earth adventures. Cannot belive he defeated Sauron. Wish i was a Hobbit like him so we can be best Hobbit pals. Elijah Wood played as him in the book, movie and video game(return of the king). (Gasp) is that Sting which frodo used to fight evil?"
5,Beautiful replica for fans,"This replica is not meant to be a toy for playing in my opinion, it is too expensive and too exquisite. It is a beautiful exhibition piece for fans of the Muppet Show. Material and manufacture are of very good quality, and arms, legs and mouth can be adjusted to different positions.It should be kept in mind that shipping and handling costs a lot, especially overseas."
3,Big disappoitment...,"As i saw that it was a Kermit Replica, i thought it was an exact replica of the Kermit seen on the Muppet show. The only problem for me is that it's not a plush puppet. It's just a doll... Big Disappoitment..."
3,Worth a watch. (One watch only),"A fleeting moment in the passing of film history. Too overshadowed by the greatness of the book. While most people remember Return of the King , Lost in Translation, and Mystic River being the best of 2003, Seabiscuit will only be held as a sentimental sports movie (like Rocky except without the uplifting end that wasn't a happy ending). It has it's merits but is very mediocre considering the artistic triumphs of this year. If you thought Forrest Gump was the movie of the century, didn't get a minute of Pulp Fiction, or thought the love story in Titanic was a real portrait of romantic love then I would recommend this. But if you tolerate movies with subtitles, thinks that subtleness is not a bad thing, and hate being emotionally spoonfed, then I would recommend you stay far away from this. 3-Stars for the effort and the fact that I was entertained for most of it."
1,HORSEFEATHERS,"Big, bland, boring saga that manages to turn the excitement of thoroughbred racing into a dull pony ride. The characters are empty shells given sympathy from tragic pasts that are hammered home early in the film, and Seabisquit himself remains an anonymous animal whose only mannerisms and character are told to us through a voice over narration. Sudden artsy camera work, a purposeless, nearly silent female lead, and a constant attempt to insure the film doesn't veer into ""Lassie Come Home"" territory make for a sometimes visually beautiful but deadly dormant day at the track. ""Seabisuit"" gets scratched at the post."
1,limp biscuit,"Animal abuse is the least of this movie's problems. It's slow, boring, and overrated. Basically, it's another silly movie with ""Oscar bait"" written on its face. There's no substance. Tobey Maguire was awesome in ""Spiderman,"" but he ain't working in this flick. Skip this self-important turkey and rent ""Gigli"" instead."
2,Animal abuse was too disturbing to enjoy the film,"This film is full of animal abuse, and some of it even seemed to be encouraged by the writers. Breeding horses for the sole purpose of making money from racing them is just plain wrong. The acceptable practice of ""putting down"" or killing a horse after it is wounded is disgusting.The only reason why I gave this movie 2 stars is because the acting was pretty good and it portrayed the story fairly accurately, from a historical perspective. But if you have any love for animals at all, you will not find this film very entertaining."
5,A Beautiful Movie with Morals and an Inspiring Story,"For those of us that are tired of today's ""crank-em-out"" movie industry that has become the classless standard, Seabiscuit is a breath of fresh air. I'd venture to say that Seabiscuit was one of the most underrated movies of 2003 with limited release in theaters in its opening week and overshadowed by Pirates of the Caribbean. However, as time progressed, Seabiscuit gained speed and soon hit screens nationwide.The whole story is based within the Boom and Depression eras of United States history- three men, each struggling for happiness in their lives, come together and put their last hopes in one another- and one hapless racehorse.Beautiful scenery, an inspiring story of second chances, and excellent acting make this movie a real winner. You'll laugh, you'll probably cry, and you'll definitely not be wasting your money on a formulaic film that Hollywood likes to give us these days."
5,Seabiscuit and the Hope during the Depression,"""You don't throw away a whole life just 'cause he's banged up a little.""Based on a true story of a horse that was written off only to capture the hearts and prizes of the American horse racing scene. Seabiscuit's magic was his heart. He defeated the legendary pedigreed War Admiral despite his awkward form with his heart determined to win. It's the kind of movie to make you believe that horses have a magic all their own."
2,Seabiscuit still in the stall...,I haven't been able to play this DVD in any of my DVD players as of yet... A screen comes up telling me I need a software upgrade... Haven't had the time to see what's going on yet...
3,"Too long, moved too slow, lacked the big emotional punch.","First, the acting was great. Second, the direction was beautiful. However, if you're like me, an Average Consumer who's not looking to determine if this should be the next Academy Award nominee - the movie itself was too long and the plot moved too slow. At 141 minutes, I was ready for it to end long before it did. The first 30 minutes or so are all background about the people who come in contact with Seabiscuit later in life. In my opinion, all that staging wasn't necessary or perhaps would have been better served to just focus on one person, not three. The film would have been more enjoyable if the emphasis was more on the horse and the races and the amazement of the accomplishments. Also, this movie is not really something a child under 13 should see (it is rated PG-13 after all) but I know a few people who took the little ones thinking ""oh, this is just a horse movie."" This is not something they will be able to follow or enjoy."
2,It coulda been a contender.,"I think a lot of people--grown-up people, anyway--really want to like this film for what it aspires to be. And it's a movie that had a lot of potential--good actors, good characters, good concept, good sets, good cinematography, and a not too bad horse. There's lots of really good stuff. But having a lot of really good stuff doesn't necessarily make a really good movie, and Seabiscuit is Exhibit A.A lot of people have commended this movie for its unhurried leisurely pace. I say nonsense. This movie is just plain slow, and it's slow because someone wasn't willing to make the cuts necessary to tighten it up. Good story telling requires discipline, and that's where this film falls short. What's left is a potentially great film that falters at the gate. Definitely one to rent first."
5,Great movie!,"I bought this movie since we got a DVD player for Christmas, and we have 2 horses... even if you are not a horse lover, I think you will like it. I sat down to only plan watching 20 minutes of it, (going to sleep) and I couldn't stop watching! Great movie! I will watch again. Worth the purchase. People I know who don't even like horses, recommended this movie to me! Buy it today!"
3,Good movie; great book,"Anyone enjoying the movie should definitely go on to read the book. The two are not even remotely comparable. The movie is a bit disappointing, as is so often the case, if you read the book first. There is so much detail that had to be left out, and so many major facts that have to be altered.So, if you haven't read the book, do so. If you loved the movie, you'll like the book more. If you liked the movie, you will probably love the book. And if you disliked the movie, you will still probably love the movie.I did like Chris Cooper a lot in his role as the trainer, though he talks a lot more in the movie than he was reputed to talk in real life, where his silence was famous."
5,Wonderful peace of work.,Tobey Maguire is Johnny. A.K.A. Red. He is the man that could handle Seabiscuit like nobody can do. Jeff Bridges is the man that hired Maguire to ride the horse. He has a wife that is going to help Bridges to get Maguire to ride the horse. William H. Macy plays the guy who does all the radio stuff for example this little toy called the xylophone. Maguire's best friend is Georgie who is substituting Magire after he hurt himself. The horse race scenes are really spectacular.
4,Winners,The movie was so awesome. It was very exiting to watch and hope Seabiscuit won the races and the horse becoming limp and Red Pollard's damaged leg but still coming out in the top of the last race. You could succeed after anything if you try with all your heart and really want to do what you are set out to do. ****
3,Lovely to look at but not always compelling otherwise,"Seabiscuit has a touch of nostalgia, a happy ending, and the distinctive feel of documentaries and biopics. The movie is beautifully filmed and well acted but unevenly scripted and a bit dull. Visuals are definitely a highlight of the movie. Watching this on a big screen was a feast for the eyes. Scenery is beautifully captured and colors are crisp and vibrant throughout. The story and its message are uplifting and the final scenes are well told, but much of the rest of the movie was a disappointment. The acting is fine (as one might expect from the individuals involved), but the script is cliche-riddled and unsophisticated; as a result the actors' performances never feel special. Overall, I felt like the movie was trying too hard to blend big-story telling with documentary filmmaking style: pretty, a tad slow, alternately moving and unaffecting."
4,"The American ""Chariots of Fire.""","The only negative criticism here is that this movie is very predictable. Does anyone really think Seabiscuit is going to lose any of the close races he is in? There were others, but I won't nitpick such a finely made film. It is finely made. It is heartfelt, and emotional, and the quality of the production is top-notch. This just isn't the masterpiece that so many people have told me. I have an aunt who asked me if I had seen this movie. When I told her ""no, not yet"" she gasped and was at a loss for words to describe what she apparently thought was one of the greatest films she had ever seen. While it is a good film, and some might see it as flawless and beautiful, it is not perfect. I could name 5 films from last year that I thought were better than this one. Could anyone really say this is on the same level as ""Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"" or ""The Pirates of the Carribean""? However, ""Seabiscuit"" is worth seeing. Perhaps more than once."
4,A Front Runner,"Sea Biscuit is definitely a memorable movie. Its so much more than just a movie about a horse. It shows how horse racing fits in with the changes over time. In addition, the movie depicted the relationships between the horse and the trainer, jockeys, and owner. Many serious moments but plenty of good humor. I loved it when they tried to give Sea Biscuit a goat as a companion and one minute later you hear a loud whinny and the goat is flying out of the stable. When owner, Jeff Bridges finally brings along another hrose, the scene is oh so memorable especially when the barnyard dog is hanging out with the lovestruck horses.Anyway, Jeff Bridges fits in very well as the owner as he comes across both charming and prominent. However, Bill Macy steals the show as the racetrack announcer with his soap opera like antics.A little long at 2 1/2 hours. The middle part can drag just a little. However, the overall impression is definitely a good one."
4,Loved it,"I read the book, and this is very much like the book! I'm sure there's differences between the real story and the book/movie, but if you read the book and want to see it on the little screen, this gets pretty close!"
1,Seabiscuit DVD,"I didn't hate it--I couldn't even view it---my DVD machine kept saying ""no DVD disc--cannot be viewed""--so all it was worth was a waste of money and an item for the garbage.It would have cost me more to return it than it was worth. I understand that ""HD DVD"" cannot be played on the machines we have now??Why are they even sold?? Makes me wonder about some of Amazon's merchants !!"
5,Awsome !!!,"The movie is great from start to finish , the story , the actors Toby Maguire, Jeff Bridges ,Chris Cooper etc.did a great job.This has to be HD at it's best. True eye popping eye candy.I recomend this movie to anyone. Truely a reference HD dvd."
5,amazing,"absolutely awesome. It make you sit back in your seat and sweat. Only one other movie did that to me. The Return of the King. Anything that can do that to me, I like. Perfect cast, and I'm surprised it wasn't nominated for way more Academy Awards. I say It should have been nominated for at least 10, i'm serious. It is absolutely stunning. I think the best performance is actually Chris Cooper as the trainer. He should win an Academy Award sometime. An awesome movie, i highly recommend you see it."
4,Worth buying,"It's Ken Burns meets Frank Capra in the inspirational true story of Seabiscuit, the little horse who could. This inspirational tale follows a half-blind ex-boxer (Tobey Maguire), a mustang breaker (Chris Cooper) and a millionaire (Jeff Bridges) as they bring their knobby-kneed, undersized racehorse, Seabiscuit (played by a herd of horses), to win Horse of the Year honors in 1938. But the movie is not just about a racer; the horse's personal story of triumph over tragedy mirrors that of the American nation in that era. Based upon the book by Laura Hillenbrand.A great companion for this DVD is the 2007 RuffRuffianian movie.Staci Layne Wilson"
1,Terrible,"I hate this movie! It was so poorly put together, you couldpush a whole heard of elephants through it, I'm glad I onlyrented it instead of wasting money on this piece of garbage."
1,What the hell.......,This movie was so lame I couldn't even get past the first hour. It had no story and the movie was just plan dumb. What were the developers or even the writers thinking? How could anyone like this dumba$$ movie? Damn I can't even begin to think how bad this movie is.
1,NEVER AGAIN!!!!!,"This was the worst piece of you know what I have ever watched! 45 min into the film there was still no mention of ""the"" horse. It was extremely boring until the horse came into the picture and then it was only so-so. My family and I had a hard time keeping track of the characters due to the fact that the film jumped around so much. I would have turned it off after the first hour but felt obligated to watch it at least once since we shelled out the money. Don't waste your time!"
1,Bad Movie,"This movie stinks. its about the people not the horse, and the horse only won 4 races. he is not a ''great race horse'' war admril is a great race horse. in real life seabiscuit was much taller. this is not a good movie."
1,Deja Vu or my pocket aches but my spirit is strong,"I imagine the writers of this movie sitting around, with their itchy pockets, trying to come up with a cliche collage, that comes through as clever this days in Hollywood. Alongside with their copy of : ""make big bucks writing A- class drama:use ackward couplings to lure them into your pocket!"" .The chosen formula: simile between historical event& the human struggle of X underdogs. Fill in the blanks: 1-Historical event>the great depression (big horse with economic broken leg due to big losses)2-Underdogs>A. a small fiesty horse who: breaks a leg.B.A small fiesty jockey who looses his parents and breaks a leg.C. A manager who looses his son/not break a leg.All legs and loses recuperate, at the end and succeed, and recover from poverty."
2,airbiscuit,"At best, Seabiscuit is a mediocre movie. It's really baffling that it could receive a best picture nomination during such a good movie year. Even Cold Mountain, which teetered towards being too typically ""Hollywood"" seemed a better choice. And, I really had expected this to be a good movie. It's based on a good story and has an outstanding cast, and horse films usually allow for some powerful effects (think of The Black Stallion). The third person narration was just a signal of an uninteresting directing style and emotional spoon-feeding. 5/10"
2,Horsefeathers,"Biopics are hard to do when they're about people, let alone animals. Arguably, this pic was about people too; however, the star of the show was a four-footer and his race---and, sadly, the production left me wanting to drown my disappointment in a feedbag of fermented oats. I had really been looking forward to this film, so it was a double-downer. The close-ups of the horses were kind of thrilling, the stories of the people were not. The use of bogus news reels was annoying and cheesy and, while I'm a Randy Newman fan, I found his score cloying. The best of the three leads was Tobey McGuire; Chris Cooper and Jeff Bridges both looked befuddled and misdirected. Surprisingly, my favorite performer had only about 5 minutes of screen time: William H. Macy as a hyper-enthusiastic announcer---he nailed the 'tude and tone of sportscasters of yore. I think Seabiscuit could have been a good documentary or a good movie, but not both at the same time. Two thumbs down, both mine."
4,Not as good as the critics are saying.,"Still pretty good. A bit overhyped, but good. Tobey Maguire is a very talented actor, so I think he'll have a future. See the movie if you like films based on true stories."
1,Seabiscuit --HD DVD,"Although we have an HD Sony LCD 46"" TV and Sony BluRay DVD player, the HD DVD will not work on our system. We learned that an HD DVD player is required to play Secretariat. With a $500 Sony BluRay player, we will not buy another unit--a disappointing situation."
5,Here comes Seabiscuit !,"Having read the book and seeing the movie, I can say that the movie does a very good job at portraying the story of Seabiscuit. Theres a few scenes i would have liked to see in the movie, but its understandable that they did not want to make a 3 to 3 and a half hour long movie. The movie did not go into the character of Silent Tom as much as I would have liked. Such as how he helped nurse The Biscuit back to health. I wish the movie would have shown how Seabiscuit was scratched many times while on the East due to rain. I could go on, but theres no need to. This movie was Great !! Whether you're a horse lover or just the average movie goer, this one is for you. Best Picture of the Year !"
5,Universal 100th Anniversary Bluray's - Extras?,"First off love the film, and have it on Region 1 DVD.Was going to buy this Universal 100th Anniversary version, but just noticed Amazon has no details on any Extras / Special Features on this disc? Checked with a few of the other 100th Anniversary selection, and this seems to be the case with a lot of them (Apollo 13, Sixteen Candles and Inglourious Basterds for example).Can you update this Amazon? As a lot of people buy Bluray's / DVDs for extras as much as they buy them for the movie itself.Cheers,Simon"
5,Great Movie For Horse Lovers,"This movie was really great. I myself have loved horses all my life and have been riding for about 3 years. I believe that even non-horse lovers will enjoy this movie. Unless you believe that racing horses is wrong, which some of these reviews imply. I belive it is not wrong, and you can see why just by watching this movie. The horse is bred to run and so it loves racing, its their instinct. The movie also inspired me to read the book, which (if you enjoy the movie) is something that will continue your love of the movie.After reading the book I believe they could have made the movie better by including more of the details. But all in all, the movie is a great summary of the events of Seabiscuit."
3,Loved the racing scenes but...,"...I thought Jeff Bridges' performance had more than a whiff of ham about it. I would give this film 3 1/2 stars if Amazon had that kind of system; I did enjoy it and I thought it was basically well-written & performed. The racing scenes were absolutely superb. I enjoyed the performances of Toby McGuire & Gary Stevens, and Chris Cooper was also flawless. I thought the film began somewhat awkwardly but it righted itself within the next ten minutes."
5,Wonderful!,"Great! Did leave the plot line of the book a few times, but a beautiful story!!! Excellently done and I thoroughly enjoyed every moment of it. Enough said, this is a fantastic pick for any horse lover or anyone in general at all!"
3,Second Chance Populism,"In Sea Biscuit,the big horses are great to look at, and the photography of racing is exciting, but this tale of second chance Depression Populism falls short. It's the mean Republicans against the noble Democrats during the Great Depression. Poor people look saintly while they're starving, and we know that uncaring rich people that don't want to pay their fair share of taxes cause bad times. There's the mandatory shot of the great Franklin Roosevelt offering a helping hand, so we have a tale that blends My Horse Flicka with 1930's hard times, and we come up with a wishful fantasy history. If only Roosevelt ended the Depression with social programs and government jobs. Let's see. The Depression started approximately in 1930 and Roosevelt and the new Deal were still going strong by Pearl Harbor. Hmmm, if it had not been for a war economy, with Roosevelt's help we would still be in Depression today, but don't let reality get in the way of a feel good movie."
1,This movie was a pile of horse...,"This was one of the worst movies that I have ever had to suffer through. All of the performances were over done, (with the exception of Chris Cooper, who is always top notch) and the entire movie was cheesier than consession stand nachos. I am completely confused at all of the accolades that this movie has received. The true story had much more depth; they barely touched on the horse trainers alcohol problem, nor the battle with eating disorders/substance abuse that Tobey Maguire's character went through. The glossed-over finished product struggled so hard to be ""heart-warming"" in every scene that the potentially touching story lost all validity. Basically, it sucked."
1,broken,put this dvd in 3 different machines and did not work in any of them. Said that it did not recognize disc. will cost more to return than I paid for it so I guess I'll look elsewhere for dvds now.
1,This DVD Would Make a Great Coaster,"Using your copy of ""Seabiscuit"" to set drinks on would be a more interesting use for it than actually playing the boring thing. Oh, what a safe, boring, dull movie this is. Gary Ross obviously went to the Ron Howard school of directing, where points are pounded home with a hammer and anvil and manipulated emotions are manufactured with assembly-line rapidity. This is the kind of movie where everyone delivers lines that sound like they should be on self-help bumper stickers; homilies are handed out like parking tickets. And the movie doesn't end until each character gets to deliver at least one clunker, and most of them get to deliver many more.""Seabiscuit"" isn't even really a bad movie--it's an uninteresting movie, which is much worse. Even bad movies can be fascinating, but the filmmakers here aim so low at trying to please the lowest common denominator of viewer that they've put together a batch of pandering mush that has not one genuine emotion in it.Yuck..."
2,Way overrated.,"I'll break it down for ya. The first hour of this movie is disjointed, tedious, and dull. The second half is basically a tired ""underdog wins against all odds"" type of story. You've seen this same scenario in dozens of other superior films. Except here, it's sappy, predictable and maudlin.I'm not horsing around when I suggest skipping it."
3,Well.....,"1 star for the movie itself.....no big deal. An extra star and a half for Tobey Maguire - he's awesome!! star, because a Hollywood-movie dared to show the death of a child and smoking people!! (It's still MUCH too nice and MUCH too politically correct.) That's three.....actually a full star more than it really deserves, but what the heck."
5,All That Is Good In American Cinema....,"Is defined in the film ""Seabiscuit"". Based upon the bestselling book of the same title by Laura Hillenbrand, this film distills the story of the unlikely Seabiscuit down to its essence and while like most films based on books it glosses over/leaves out certain elements, it is a triumph unto itself. Well acted *I admit frankly it changed my opinion of Tobey Maguire...who was one of the executive producers as well!!*, well scripted, beautifully filmed and with a sublime score from Randy Newman, Seabiscuit delivers on all levels. It is a refreshing reminder of the power and grace of the American cinema, of what Hollywood can do if it chooses to and that film is a form of art to be reckoned with."
5,seabiscuit,came on time came in very great shape as discribed!Thank you for fast delivery & service!
1,i dont liek horses,"Unlike the thousands of people out there that love horses, i do not. And i dislike how this movie portray riding horses to be good. Why the f do we ride horses still, i'm sure they don't liek it. I mean, i don't liek horses but i'm not sadistic enough to torture them by riding on their backs. These s0-called people to ""love"" horses and ride them are insane.the only reason why i dont liek horses is because of a bad experience in which someone could have helped me or a horse, and the person helped the horse, leaving me out in the cold."
2,Universal's Seabiscuit Could Have Been Better,"Seabiscuit is yet another example of how Hollywood (in this case, Universal Studios) takes a nice story, having the potential to be a really nice ""family"" film, and turns it into an adult feature. I lost count of the number of irritatingly-blasphemous foul words used! As it usually goes with most movies, these words did absolutely nothing to enhance dialog at all. Discerning parents will probably want to keep their children away from this one.The DVD's packaging was another sore spot. Instead of getting the usual chapter insert and liner notes with the disk, Universal Studios decided that the purchaser would rather own a ""barker"" sheet for Buick! Yes, even you could win a new Buick Rainier! How poor is that?"
3,If Rocky Balboa were a horse....,"...i suppose his name would be Seabiscuit. I think the thing that makes this movie work is that it is based on a true story. It's a feel-good movie that really has some shining moments.Honestly, I have little interest in horse-racing and that's why I don't think much of this film. Tobey Maguire is fine but the movie is a little forgettable, in my opinion."
2,A total bore,"I thought this film was cheesy. The storyline was choppy in the beginning-and it was very predictable. I think if you like horses, by all means rent it.I just could not get into it. It wasn't a bad movie-it just wasn't a film that captivated me."
2,Has the whole world gone mad?,"This movie was nominated for best picture?The worst choice ever. Even when they nominate terrible movies (like English Patient), they are at least oscar material.But nominate such a run-of-the-mill, unoriginal, and only mildely entertaining movie?The movie was ok, Jeff Bridges was very good. Maguire was like he usualy is, and Chris Cooper is nothing amazing. I can't believe Williams H. Macy was even in the running in the globes for such a jokey role, which requires no actign at all. And he wasn't even nominated for The cooler, his best performance ever.And why the hell is Steven Soderberg doing commentary on this movie?"
2,A good concept poorly executed,"I really wanted to like Seabiscuit, but simply couldn't. It has a phenomenal cast including Tobey McGuire and William H. Macy among others. The actors couldn't compensate for a disjointed script that tries to tell the story of too many individuals too quickly. For comparison, Apollo 13 (another historical drama), really tells the story from the Lovell family point of view with the rest of the subplots supporting that viewpoint. Seabiscuit tries to tell the owner's story, the jockey's story, and the horse's story without every drawing the viewer into any one of those stories. I never got to the point where I cared about any of these characters. And, the rivalry story line just left me flat; I didn't care whether Seabiscuit won. This movie could have used its fine cast much more effectively"
3,"Feel-good movie, but that's it!","When I was a kid I used to follow horse races a lot, so this movie understandably appealed to me, considering it's about the story of a short horse that beats the odds and becomes one of the United States' best race horses. Having become famous at a time when the country was coming out of the depression, it stood as an example of what the ""small man"" could hope for: there was an opportunity there for those who were willing to take a chance and fight for it. So there's more than the basic story of an animal and the people surrouding it. There's the whole country metaphor that keeps coming back once and again in the movie.Overall, a feel-good movie but not an instant classic or an Oscar contender, if you ask me. Absolutely worth renting, but buying...? I'd argue..."
1,A Lemon?,I may have received a lemon. I thought I was getting the movie Seabiscuit but what I received was parts of the movie with a voice over of the movies maker in a discussion of how the movie was made. A big disappointment.
4,Feel good but not sappy,"Too many short scenes early on, cutting to things that don't really make sense (bull fight, boxing, dismantling car, riding train) and have no dialogue. The Depression era newsreel updates and voiceovers were annoying, but overall it worked as a parable for Depression era, up-by-your-bootstraps hope, w/o sinking into total sentimentality - not everything works out as it would if the whole thing were scripted and Disney-esque, which I appreciated."
5,For Horse Lovers,"This is my all time favorite horse movie! I will never see it enough. Since it's based on a true story, the history behind the story is fascinating. But it's the little guy winning that makes the movie. The owner suffering the loss of his son, the trainer suffering the loss of his way of free range life, the jockey suffering the loss of his family and the horse suffering from the mistakes of other men. Together they heal each other and create a bond for life."
4,What a ride!,"Seabiscuit does not disappoint. It is much more than just a story about horse racing. Seabiscuit explores a full range of human (and animal) conflicts, dreams, loss, hope and victory. The characters all experience trials and restoration. Some of the acting and set that is era-related seems staged and too made up, but the story and the main characters carry the day.I was moved emotionally by the triumph of the horse, the jockey, the trainer and the owner. This is definitely a feel-good movie, because it gives you every reason to feel good about the events in it, plus since it is based on a true story, it is totally realistic and believable--nothing in it is too good to be true--it is good and true.I think you will really enjoy it."
4,Really hard!,"I don't know what that other reviewer is talking about but this jigsaw is really, really difficult. I would NOT recommend giving it to smaller kids at all and there are 550 very small pieces.It took me almost a month of painstaking work to get this thing put together, the middle portion is the best place to start, with lots of things going on, but the top 3rd is impossible. There's too much blue and hardly any distinction, it's far to hard to tell those pieces from one another because they all look the same.Yes, it's a cool jigsaw puzzle coz it's Garfield and comes in an attractive, sturdy tin, but no way is something this difficult for kids."
3,It's a good place to start.,"Having been to the Monterey area before, I was looking for information about where to stay/dine with our small kids. That guide does not seem to exist. Several restaurants this author mentioned were excellent, but one was a real dog. (Hint: Monterey is not the spot for pizza.) Our saving grace was when we found a copy of a local rag that listed Readers' Choices. Travel books should rely on these for restaurant reviews and also spend more time exploring accomodations."
4,I'm speechless...,"This is one of the most disturbing (and not to mention unintentionally funny) films I've ever seen. The dubbing is atrocious, the violence over-the-top, and the full frontal nudity extreme -- there is a LOT of male frontal nudity in this film; so much so that I suspect that either the writer or director was...well, INTO male full frontal nudity.When watching this, notice how the gang members NEVER damage the hero's (?) car -- it probably wasn't in the budget. Perhaps it was even a loaner!I'm giving this 4 stars simply because of how awful it is. It's so bad, it's funny."
5,Awesome,"Excellent read, I highly recommend picking up a copy, it's a definite keeper! This book was extremely well written and fast paced, I couldn't put it down. I wanted to read all of her other work as soon a I finished reading this one. I was amazed to find out this was the first book that had ever been published by this author. She is a really talented writer, and I am looking forward to the publishing of Mrs. Cole's second book, The Price of Pleasure, telling Sea Captain Grant Sutherland's story, that is said to be released soon from Pocket books."
5,EXCELLENT book!!!,"This is one of the very best books I've ever read!The picture on the cover drew my attention. Here is a good-looking man yet with some mystery since we can't see the front of him.The book held my attention throught the entire thing, every single page... This was one of the most sensual books I've ever read and it didn't border on discusting as some of the recent erotic romances have been...This is one of the most talented authors and I REALLY look forward to the next book from her!!!!!"
2,Girl keeps running away and uninteresting characters.,"I loved this author's book ""A Hunger Like No Other,"" so I thought I'd try this book which I believe was her first book. I was disappointed and cannot recommend it. The two main characters did not hold my interest. Nicole and Derek were attracted to each other. Each time they were together and their relationship started to grow to the next level, she would run off and hide. He was miserable and failed to find her each time except at the end. This separation cycling annoyed me. Also, there were some conflicts caused by lack of direct communication between them. One would say something and the other thought it meant something different. I don't like novels using this form of conflict development. Sexual content: strong."
4,started slow,"but picked up in the end. I really enjoy her historicals, i don't think it was as good as the book that comes after it but overall not bad."
1,no good,"This product does not work very well. The main issue is that the cord does not stay in the little hook spots. As a result, my headphone cord does not stay on its ""manager"". Also, the product was way over priced. You are better off using half a pencil and some duct tape..."
5,Review for Up front,What Bill maudlin said about the attitudes of combat soldiers in WWll still resonates today with todays generation fighting for us today during the global war on terrror.
5,How I was introduced to the Army,"When I was not shaving yet I bought this book in a thrift shop. It was and is one of the best things I ever bought out of there. I learned more about the Army from it than from anything else outside of Basic Training.The amazing thing I learn from it is that while the uniforms, equipment & weapons change. There is one constant in the universe for sure and that is The Army really does'nt change.Thanks Bill and God Bless you!"
5,Good book,"If your looking at this book your probably interested in WW2 , I enjoyed reading this book and his other book, Willie and Joe the WW2 years"
1,How many carats?,"The item description does not include the total carat weight for this necklace, and important factor with this kind of product."
3,Randy Crawford,"I like the track Alvaz, but the reasonI purchased this cd was for the trackI don't wanna be Normal' a song I can reallyrelate to. I think the song was also used on a movie sond track,can't remeber what movie though."
2,Good story but somewhat disjointed,This is a good story about a Navy junior commissioned officer who tangles with a superior officer who was promoted from the NCO ranks which was common in the early years of WWII. The biggest complaint is that there is sometimes a lack of a smooth transition between chapters.
3,gang affiliated,i think this kind of music is perfect for people who love the lord and enjoy hip hop beats. We need music like this so we can combine our desire/love for the Lord with music that really draws our interest!
2,WOWZZA! Gospel Gangstaz rock my world!,"To all you out there who miss the pure beats from the street and the chillin rhymes from days of old, I direct your attention to this kickin' classic by my bros in christ.Still, today, when I start to spin this disk above all disks, I feel the groove and have to throw on my j-ville jaguars jersey and spin my hat around backwards. This is the way that Christian hip-hop was meant to be. Yo Yo!"
1,It is horrible!!!!,this cd is good for people who enjoy really old school rap. Ive only listened to the cd once and its been collecting dust since. If your looking for old music this is it
3,Only One Song Got This 3 Stars,"There was only one good song that actually got this whole cd 3 stars, Track 11 Twisted Heat. I think that is the best beat Swizz has ever came up with. It switches in the middle and speeds up showing the true skills Twista and Drag-on Have. I think just that song is worth Gettin the CD"
3,Swizz shouldnt Rap,I thought the album was good until the track titled..Ho... I cant believe Swizz is turning his back on loyal fans... Notice how he didnt admit to being a racist until he was a couple albums deep! Overall the albun is good if he would leave out the racist skits about the people that made him rich!
2,Swizz needs to change hiz beatz!,"I don't know how many times Swizz can use the same beats, but just add a different hook. Swizz snapped when he first came out, but after a while, you get tired of hearing the same thing over, and over again. He didn't hook DMX up on his last CD, and he f--cked-up Drag-on's debut album. He needs to change it up, or stop. I must admit that ""Twisted Heat"" by Twista & Drag-On is tyte, but Swizz needs some new Beatz."
4,1 is good... 2 is great!,"Now normally in movies, the sequals are never as good as the originals. Not in this case! Ryde or Die vol 2 gets artists from the Bad Boy fam including Ma$e! Theres a reunion song with Puff Daddy, Ma$e and the previously known ""Badboys,"" The L.O.X. This is a must buy I love it, you'll love it. Gotta get this one."
1,"Swizz is NOT a producer, he's a JOKE! Hang it up Swizz.","I can honestly say that I don't remember the last time I heard beats this wack. I should've known this album was booty when I saw it in the record store USED TWO DAYS AFTER IT CAME OUT! DMX wasn't on that many songs, GOOD! The last tight thing he did was his first album. After that, he fell off. Swizz is wack and I think he knows it now. The beats on this joint were poison to my ears. Don't buy this junk. There are too many GOOD albums to buy out there."
1,Not that great,"The first RR was off the hook. This second Compilation lacks; it kind of sounds like it was rushed. Swizz beats is getting corny, and the RR are starting to sound redundant."
4,"just go get it and get on that level,sit back and ruff ryde2","The Ruff Ryders 2 is the best album out this year(besides that boy Marshal Mathers guy,lol)this album is hot.WW3 is the the lead off song, and it deserved to be #1 on the album.Styles song ""Holiday"" is off the hook cut throat lyric's and his ""gritty"" style, is just best summed up in one word(WHOA). Drag-on spits fire with Chi-town king, Twista on ""Twisted Heat"".Another hot jam gots to be ""Stomp"" by Trick Daddy and that newcomer Yun Wun from Atl.If u like tight lyrics, head nodding beats, go get this new album from the Ruff Ryders."
3,Encore flops,"This time around, the Ruff Ryders were not on top of their game. I was nice to even give this album 2 stars. There were not enough focus on the stars of the Ruff Ryder clique. The beats were not as banging and the hooks to most of the songs were downright pitiful. Vol. 1 was much much better, but I'ma stick by my Ryde or Die niggas and continue to support their music. This album could've and should've been much better. Try again."
5,ryde or die vol.2 -the final chapter,"ryde or die vol.2 has destroy vol.1 because this is the best volume compliation released on the ruff ryders label but my favourite joints on the album is ww111,ryde or die boys, holiday,my name is kiss,got it all and other track but the album is hot from begining to end and it is very good for your music stereo and your cars and other."
4,great cd,this cd is good better than the first one best song on the cd is twisted heat with drag-on and twista
4,A cd that keeps you bouncing in your ruff ryder,"First of all this cd is not better than volume1,but I'm not saying that it isn't as good as volume 1.To get right to the the point if you like Eve,Jadakiss,Methodman,Redman,DmX,Snoop Dog,Drag-On,Busta Rhymes,and Trick Daddy this cd is a must-buy.The Headbangerz of the cd are #1 "" WW III"",#2 ""2 Tears in a bucket"",#3""Got it All"",#7 ""Weed,Hoes,Dough"",#9 ""Fright Night"",#11""Twisted heat"",#14 ""Stomp"",#15""The Great.""Plus the skits are cool too.Basically almost the whole cd tight.But with so many great rappers i think this cd should a little bit better.Keep it real and make sure you pick up this cd peace Dez.Oh yeah if have any other questions about this cd email me"
3,Ryde or Die Vol.2 Review,"For those who liked the first ruff ryders collaborative effort, this does not resemble it that much. DMX is one of the best rappers ever, and yet he is only on one song. Likewise for Eve, Drag-on, and the LOX, who are only on a few songs. It seems like this album is a debut for some younger rap artists, like Yung Wun. But overall the album is pretty good, and I recommend buying it."
5,ryde or die? u start it we end it!,this new ruff ryder compilation is ill. da best song is twista and drag-on on twisted heat. they both spit flame over some tight beats from swizz. anotha good song is ww3. snoop dogg and scarface join yung wun and jadakiss tomake this tight track. da method man and redamn joint is hot too. kiss shows he can flow without fellow lox membaz sheek and styles. my name is kiss is a very unique song where kiss slows it down and really tells whats on his mind. the only song i don't like is parle's it's going down tonight. i don't think parleis very talented at singing. the trick daddy joint is tight and yung wun's screamin tops off thesong. o ya did i mention the skit i'm an h-o-e? this is tthe funniest tthing i've heardsince the late eazy-e's gimmie that nutt. newayz pick this joint up right here. it's betta than tha 1st ruff ryder compilation. u won't be dissapointed.
2,Ruff Ryders Vol. 2,This album was a major dissapointment compared to Vol. 1. There was only about three songs that were descent the rest were down the drain no doubt. WW III was tight aswell as I got it all. But the rest was no typical Ruff Ryder material...
2,How Many 'Swizz Beats' can we take?,"Ok, I admit, I liked the first few things I heard from Swizz, ""ruff ryders anthem,"" ""Money Cash Hoes,"" but lately, the guy is just getting on my nerves. How many more beats where the strings in the back move with the same tone and melody in the chorus will we listen too? How many push-button scratches will it take for him to move to a new technique? The one thing that Swizz, who supplied the beats for the second ruff ryders compilation, usually has going for him is the MC's he works with. Most often he teams with heavy hitters Jay-Z or DMX. Not this time. His lukewarm drums and tired strings and scratches aren't masked by lyrical prowess, exposing Swizz as what he is, tragically pop, while screaming ""ryde or die."" It's a shame that this CD couldn't be better, as the Ruff Ryders have so much talent in Eve, Drag-On, DMX, and Sheik of the Lox. Alas, when the dust settles, Ruff Ryders Vol. 2 falls short of it's predecessor, and thus, as a project on the whole."
3,Not as good as i had hoped...,"I have anticipated this album coming out for a really long time. I love the first one and most of the solo albums by the ruff ryders.. dmx, eve, lox.. not really loving drag-on's cd but he has skills too. However after running out to buy this cd .. i am very disappointed! There are 16 tracks, i only really like 4 songs, and can tolerate a couple others. I really dont like the overexposure of Yung Wun.. to me he has no skillz.. and definately doesnt seem like Ruff Ryder material. Overall I'd say dont waste your money on this one."
4,"Definately better than the last one, but still lacking","This cd is not too bad. It gets off to a good start with World War 3, a song featuring snoop dogg, scarface, yung wun, and jadakiss who all give a good performance. This song is easily the best on the cd. The next song, 2 tears in a bucket is pretty good as well as got it all is not too bad. The next song that caught my attention was Twisted heat with drag-on and twista which is pretty strong (and fast). All of the tracks are pretty smooth. This cd only falters in one place. The places i thought the cd would be the strongest are really not very good songs. Fright night with busta and stomp are not very good songs. Not counting the bonus track, these are the worst songs. I would buy this cd, but i still think that the ruff ryders could pull something better off than this."
5,RIDE OR DIE 4 LIFE!,"THE DOUBLE R CAMP HAS DONE IT AGAIN. RIDE OR DIE VOL. 1 WAS THE BOMB BUT RIDE OR DIE VOL. 2 IS OFF THE HOOK! SWIZZ BEATS CONTINUES TO DO HIS THING AND EVEN HAS A SKIT 4 YALL HATERS. SO WITH THAT SAID THE BEATS ARE TIGHT EVEN THE 1'S NOT DONE BY SWIZZ. AS FOR THE TRACKS JUST LOOK AT THE WAY IT STARTS OFF WORLD WAR 3 THEN FROM THERE METH AND RED AND IT JUST FLOWS. MY FAVORITE SONGS ARE TWISTED HEAT WITH DRAG-ON AND TWISTA B4 MENTIONED WWIII, STYLES SOLO ""HOLIDAY"" AND SO MANY MORE BOTTOM LINE COOP IT! GRRRRRRRRRRRR!"
3,"Decent, but too much promotion","Well, them Ruff Ryders seemed to have hit us one mo gain with Ryde or Die (Vol. 2) and I just gotta say.. it's not as hype as it should've been. I'll admit, a good majority of tha album wuz listenable, but a few of those Swizzy tracks came out as repetitive & well... dull. I'd say tha best tracks on this LP would have to be ""WWIII"" by Snoop Dogg, Scarface, Yung Wun, and tha lyrically powerful Jadakiss, ""Twisted Heat"" where Drag-On & tha rapid-fire spitter, Twista go head 2 head over some Swizz Beatz, and tha 1st single ""Got It All"" by Eve & Jadakiss. Tha artist that shines on this album tha most would have to be that LOX member, Jadakiss. He outshines his labelmates throughout tha album & I can't wait 4 his solo release. Tha thing that made me think worse of tha album wuz tha mediocre performance by the Dark Man X. Other than that, this iz an average album.. it's worth picking up, but don't be too hyped when U pop it in tha system."
4,A Decent Follow-up to A Great Album,"RR vol. 2 is clearly a great addition to the rap scene. However, I believe that the first album was by far superior. I say this as an avid listener of the whole RR crew, especially the originals like LOX, Drag-on, and Dark Man X (DMX). Expect less chant tracks (Down Bottom) and more hardcore rap styles like the ""GO HEAD."" The song ""The Great"" is truly an atrocity to DMX, a man that has sowed the very seeds of RR with the RR Anthem. I recommend checking out something with more power rhymes, such as We Are the Streets by the LOX, three of the original Ruff Ryders. Despite my downcast attitude toward the inferior RR vol. 2, I believe hardcore rap fans will appreciate the addition of Yung Wun and solo joints by Jadakiss. All in all, blood in and blood out, this album is the hottest collaboration to hit the streets since the first volume of the Ruff Ryders."
3,A Disappointing Sequel,"Not as good as the 1st one, less of everyones favorites such as DMX, Drag-On, The Lox, Eve, who are in about 1 song each! I want the real Ruff Ryders not these posers who just say ryde or die, The only thing that did work in this cd was Snoop Dogg but he alone couldn't save this cd."
2,"Improvement From Vol. 1, but still mediocre","What's with all the five star ratings I'm seeing, and who actually thinks DMX is a good emcee? While this album is better than Vol. 1, it's still bad due to redundant raps and tired production (yes, I do mean Swizz Beatz). This album has almost no creative suject amtter, and no great emcee to compensate for it, except Eve. Instead of buying this album, go pick a Mos Def or a Canibus album."
5,Perfection,"Being on the British side of the pond I have yet to hear ALL of this album. Angela's work is difficult to get here however, after years of trying I HAVE been able to get ""Something in Red"" and, on the strength of that single song I recommend that you but this album (or 2 copies and send one to me!)"
5,definitely completes CONTROL,"This is a must must have for fans of the Control album because it includes all the remixes/video versions of singles issued from the original album. Simply put: control (live video version); nasty (cool summer mix)--which was used as opening music for Video Soul back in '87; when i think of you (dance mix--which is the video version extended); let's wait awhile; what have you done (ext mix); and Pleasure Principle (this is the version used for the video but you have to edit it yourself--it's not hard to do). Plus, you can also make the shep petibone 7"" mix which was on the radio from the version as well. So this remix disc is a complete package. Buy it while it's cheap and in print. I've had one for 10 years--and I still play it a good bit."
4,The Burns & Allen Show,"Who can't help but enjoy Gracie Allen's humor, nor George Burns dry wit. These were the early episodes, I prefer the later ones where they were not filmed on what was apparent as a 'real' stage setting, as in plays."
4,"Great CD, odd promo pairing included","Just got my cd and it came with a promo CD for a Candance Night solo song called, Gone, gone gone. It's a pretty catchy country song. Not sure if Candace has decided to branch off into country music or what, but it kind of surprised me. Just don't picture her as a country singer. Just not feeling her in that role. Still, every artist has to branch out from time to time I suppose. Village Lanterne itself is an awesome cd, and one of Blackmore's Night's countless great works."
2,disappointed,"I loved the Village Lantern when I heard it on Pandora, and thought I would be getting similar songs on this CD. Not so. instead there were some strange songs, not harmonizing, and had little content. Might have been fillers for the CD. The Village Lantern was a great song, it had depth, content, harmony and something I looked forward to hearing again. The others on the CD's(there were two), had no content, and not related to the theme of the CD at all."
5,Excellent Group,"Along with Candice Night's *excellent* voice is the *excellent* Medieval/folk Rock band led by Richie Blackmore. Don't let his Deep Purple days mislead you. This music is similar to some of the sounds you might hear on one of Mannheim Steamroller' Christmas albums.Instrumentation style is best described as *modernized* Medieval Folk. You will hear instruments like flute, strings, horn/brass, guitar, electric guitar, drums along and many others. You will *NOT* hear any digital keyboard producing computerized music which would ruin the groups unique sound.A *must have* for any music novice or buff."
2,"If I would have wanted a Fleetwood Mac alubum, I would have bought one!","What's with the rock and roll?! I don't buy Blackmore's Night albums to hear not-so-good rock songs. I have every album they have released so I was excited about this one... until I heard it. I actually got mad this album was so... not Blackmore's Night. My husband looked at me and said, ""So how does it feel when your favorite band sells out?"" AWFUL! That's how it feels! At least there was an instrumental or two that sounded slightly like them. Those songs earned the two stars I gave it."
5,One of the best albums ever!,"This album is one of the greatest recordings ever released. You have Blackmore who is one of the greatest guitarists of all time and you have his partner Night who can sing beuatiffly and who is a great lyricist as well. This album has traces of Jethro Tull, Rainbow, Deep Purple, Mike Oldfield. It also has rock elements springkled in for good measure. Nights vocals sound very similiar to Maggie Reilly who used to sing in Oldfields band. My two favorite tracks are 25 Years and World of Stone. Please give this album a chance and don't just dismiss this when you hear that it is Medievil music. I am glad that I gave it a shot."
5,Great help for relaxation,"I've found the 30-minute body relaxation exercise to be a great stress relief on my way to work or when lying in bed. Having listened to the CD regularly for the past few weeks, I am finding that it is making a profound difference in my ability to relax. I am so happy to discover that the ""relaxation response"", the brain's response to quiet meditation, is real, and actually reverses the effects of stress. It's making a bigger difference than I would have imagined. Having experienced increasing stress over the past year, I am so grateful and relieved to find something that helps. Many thanks to the author for her peaceful voice and healing images."
2,Voice on CD was annoying,"The music from the CD was very relaxing, but the author did not have a very relaxing voice. I tried to get myself use to the voice, but could not. I have not been able to listen to the CD in its entirety because of this. It would have been nice if I could have listened to a small portion of the CD before purchasing this."
2,Sample before you buy,"I am trying to find a good relaxation cd for my insomnia. I listened to the sample before buying and I'm glad I did. Personally I found her voice a little annoying, I'm sure she has the best of intentions but this wouldn't work for me!"
3,"K-I-S-S-I-N-G! ...oh, wait, wrong rhyme...","Eileen Christelow, Five Little Monkeys Sitting in a Tree (Clarion, 1991)Amusing, if lightweight, little book that undercuts its message in hopes of becoming a series. (It did, and an exceptionally popular one, at that.) A good one for reading to the kids if you like playing it up; this one would definitely be better sung than simply read. ***"
5,Love The Monkeys...,My 3 1/2 year old granddaughter has Five Little Monkeys Jumping on the Bed and Five Little Monkeys Bake a Birthday Cake and throughly enjoys having these books read to her.She has also memorized them.So she was very happy to get a copy of Five Litttle Monkeys Sitting in a Tree.It was read twice within a span of a few hours.It has very delightful and colorful pictures in it.We plan to get the rest of the Five Little Monkey books.I bought this book new on ebay for under $4.00 including shipping.
5,great for preschool,I use this for my preschool autism class and the kids love it. Many of them try to clap with their hands when the cocodile goes SNAP! I definately reccomend it.
5,Great interaction book for toddlers!,My two yr. old granddaughter loves the book! First sung the song at story hour and now we sing it several times a week. Child acts out the song and it is fun to do with them!
5,Favorite book!,"My son is 18th months old and I am so pleased that he loves books! He seems to want to read books more then play with his other toys, though he does love his trucks and cars! I purchased this after the ""jumping on the bed"" one and he loved that one, but once his Daddy started reading this one with gusto, it is now his favorite book. He wants it read to him atleast 5-7 times a day! His favorite parts are the ""SNAP!"" and he even does a cute little arm motion when he knows that is coming! Based on his love of these two books, I purchased the rest of them and I have to say this one and the ""jumping on the bed"" are the best ones. The others rhyme but in a much more complicated way then these, they are too wordy and hard to follow, where as these are simple and fun to read. Definitely perfect for a very young toddler, I suspect the other ones that follow are for older boys and girls who read these two."
3,Slow start but good book,"The supporting characters riveted me, the main character seem to drag a little. The book started off slow. I was getting worried about one third the way through, wondering when things would start to pick up. When the action did start to pick up I was pleased to see how well the author demonstrated her expertise. I feel that there was a little more character development than necessary to tell the story but all and all the story was good."
3,Scientifically unconvincing,"Though the style of writing was good, the scientific premise and details behind the backbone of this book were weak. The causes of the Diversity Crisis were not convincing. The reason the Trust women were considered to be such ""hot"" genetic material were sort of vague as was the proposed explanation for how the ""Eden Project"" was going to solve the diversity crisis."
3,Waste of money,"Worthless book. The only thing I probably learned from it is the fact that a vast portion of medical students get married during medical school (which by the way is an irrelevant fact to the topic ""Get Into Medical School"")The rest of the information you can scour from the internet.The book probably will just reassure you of what you already know, like get good grades, do volunteer work, study what you like for undergraduate school, etc."
2,Too basic!!!,"I know it`s basic,but in too hours you can do a much better job,like John Street in his 1988 Wilderness Survival Skills.Mrs. Hood is anoying,I don`t need anybody to tell me constantlyhow deeeeliiiicious is the things that she is eating,Mr.Hood isok.Ohhh... and you never put such a big rock below a figure 4 be-cause the log for the dead fall can and will be stoped by it,likeit happens in the video.The rest is so-so.I will not buy other video from Mr.and Mrs.Hood."
3,Nothing New Here,"As with his other tape, the quality of recording and instruction is poor and simplistic. Nothing new here. Don't waste your money!"
2,Fell Apart,"I wanted some cheap brushes, but these are apparently too cheap. The spongey part of the applicator slides right off the handle. I tried to keep putting these back together, but after awhile there's really no use."
3,Has Its Moments,"As a fan of much of his previous three albums, but only some of his later tracks, I reckon this is where the quality started to slip. Even the title track is only saved by a wonderful guitar solo at the end. A lot of the other tracks seem underworked or uninspired, and 'Joys Of Christmas' and 'Danielle's breakfast' are just embarrassing. That said, 'Windy Town' and 'Curse Of The Traveller' are up there with his best. Still better than Dire Straits."
4,Another Hit from Chris Rea,"This music is another example of Chris' soulful guitar-backed love songs. If you like his music you won't go wrong with any of his CDs. If you're looking for music similar to Mark Knopler's solo work but with a little more punch, this is it."
5,"It's Chris Rea, what else needs to be said","The song ""Curse Of The Traveller"", is more than worth the price of the entire CD. Chris is a great songwriter, singer and can play anything. He has a wonderful voice which is at times sensual as most of his songs are if you really listen. He writes through his heart, life experiences and I love the man and his music.Mare"
1,Disappointment,I thought I was ordering a guided imagery/meditation CD. All this is is canned synthesized pseudo-music. The only thing it's done for me is give me a headache.
2,not relaxing at all......,"I too, had hoped for guided meditation, but was willing to settle for this form of music to bring me to a relaxed state..... it did nothing of the sort... it actually was much more stimulating than I could handle for an hour at bed time.I only hope the store will take it back.... maybe cool if you like new-age... or for background music for lmp's... but not for relaxing on your own.... at least not for me.......and... my head-ache was worse at the end of listening. I give it 2 stars... it was not horrible.... just not 5 stars."
5,Talbot Brothers.,This recording is an excellent overview of the careers of John Michael and Terry Talbot. I love this CD very much.
3,Reviewed by a 12 year old girl!,"This doll is ok..it teaches girls about being a docter. I got this last christmas and likeed it (for alittle while)! It is in my closet right now. It is a nice toy, but they should have made it better! I also like the toy because it comes with a Kelly doll for my collection! I now have 25 Kelly dolls! :)"
2,It's not the greatest,"I'm an electrical engineering major, and I got this soldering iron to do some lab work with. I was rather disappointed with it. The tip got dirty real quick and using the sponge didn't help. It didn't transfer heat very well at all. I think maybe it should just be used for hobby stuff. Just my two cents"
4,Eco Friendly Carpenters CD?,"They have used ""new technology"" to give you a New and Updated Carpenters CD in a paper case. Not all that flattering. The CD itself has good quality, but you don't really need to buy it unless you have a thing for collecting all of their albums."
3,A great book for the 1970's,"I had no idea that this book was written so long ago. I suppose it was great for its time but when the author refered to statistics and studies from the 1970's I knew that I could find more up-to-date material. For example, this book talks about how there are not enough statistics about breastfeeding because only a small number of women choose to breastfeed. I am sure that this book was great in the 70's and 80's but a lot of what I have read is not relevant for parents in the 90's."
5,It does more than skim the surface!,"I have read dozens of books (including Dr. Sears' and the 'What to expect' fluff books), and I have found this book to be the most informative. It gives you pros and cons of many case studies and allows you to draw your own conclusions. Without being preachy, this book thoroughly explains the point of view and the reference capabilities of the infant. My one year old is delightfully outgoing and happy; the information I gleaned from this book has contributed greatly to his disposition. I also LOVED 'How Babie's Talk'."
3,Mid-90s techno,"Great atmosphere, but at the end, more clever than inteligent and not destined for greatness."
5,Awesome!,I had this CD a few years back and it was among some CDs that were stolen from me. I have been looking for it here and there with no luck. It seems to be one of the hard ones to get and its pricey but well worth it. This is Willie's best music......period. Item was like new and packaged well. Get one if you like Willie.
2,What in the name of horses?!?!?!?,"Okay, whats with the cover? ""Wonders Legacy""?!??!? Okay, im glad hes back but is there now a 3rd TB generation?!?!??! Oh no, just when we were getting used to Christina.... Also they have already used the 'in danger' part in Glory. Whats the deal?!?!?! I guess we have to just wait and see...."
4,I hope it's good!,I don't know if I can wait for September and October for Thoroughbred 36 (Without Wonder) & 37 (Star in Danger) to come out! I hope this book keeps up the racing that has happened in the last few books. I'm so glad they've gone back to racing. I hope it turns out well!
5,5+ stars!,"This book was soooooo good! I loved the way Christina fought for Star and didn't give, finally making her parents see. Ashleigh was beginning to like Star at the end too! I really loved this book! Christina acted really mature in trying to figure out how to get her parents to see that star was in danger and to rescue him from the Townsends. Christina and Star are the best!(...) The series is getting better now that it is back to racing! (...)"
4,Read this book!,"Star In Danger is a really good book, and I'm sooooooooo glad the series is starting to head back to racing. That was way better than eventing--not that eventing's bad, just racing's better. Still, I wish that all the old characters would be explained. There are so many loose ends--Pride, Champion, Glory, Shining, Cindy, Dylan, Katie, Cassidy, Ashleigh's second child...come on! At least write a few books, specials maybe, that explain what in the world happend. Ten years were skipped, and that's a lot to make up. Also, the books were way better when Joanna Campell wrote them--the other authors can't get the facts straight, and they're just no as good. I'm glad Christina likes Parker and he ditched his parents--they're such jerks. They need to start to introduce a few more different aged characters so the series isn't stuck on Christina and her friends. Well, anyways, read the book if you like the others. It's definately at least a litte improvement."
5,What this book is about,"Okay, I just went to the Harper Collins site. Christina finds out while visiting Townsend Acres that an ex-Whitebrook horse, Star, is being abused by his trainer. It's up to her to ride the Thoroguhbred as no one else can see the talent she sees in him. It's true! Check it out and see!"
4,It was pretty good,I think this book was really good.I think it's great that Parker is with Christina but what happened to Dylan? I didn't think that Christina would desert Sterling because Sterling was Christina's favorite and all. The books are starting to repeat themselves kind of. I guess they could get better but the writers keep on changing! I wish they could stick with just one person.
5,i liked this book,"i really like how they are putting some romance in these books, and i liked how it was in this one. I wish Christina was still into eventing, cause that's what i ride. I mean the books can still have racing as their main theme, but they could still have more eventing..."
4,This book is good but is to zoomed in on the main charector.,"I like the book in general, it has a good story line. The only fualts I see are that Camball focuses only on Christina, her other charectors are only vagly refered at diffrent times in the book. Camball should try to get a larger picture, by including more of the charectors."
1,Bad book!!!!,"This was a VERY bad book!!!!! I mean, for one, they shouldn't have skipped a year. two, parker sucks!!! i personally prefer dylan. and where did katie and chad and the others go?? i mean, kevin's practically not even in this one!!! only melanie and parker!!! did dylan and katie just disappear? i think that ashleigh is also acting rilly dumb. this book was also really boring and undiscriptive. sure, she went into racing. big deal!!! it barely talks about it! only her love for star. ashleigh loved wonder too! but that was WAY more interesting!!!! anyways, be free to e-mail me."
2,What Happened,"I really liked the Thoroughbred books until I read #36 and on. They totally wiped Dylan, Katie, and Cassidy out of the picture without ever telling what happened to them! I also don't think Christina sould throw her whole life away for just 1 horse. I think she should still event with Sterling. They already have Melanie racing. She saves Star in this book, and doesn't think about Sterling once! Her obsession is not so good. It just gets worse in coming books."
1,defies explanation,"i bought this based on the sherlock holmes interest i have had since a kid and also because christopher lee was in it..but its a real stinker,dubbed awfully,to the point that even christopher lee admitted that it wasnt his voice used in the end product! a total waste of money and time,save your pennies,badly done all round...even christopher lee's later tv reincarnation of sherlock holmes was much better,incident at victoria falls and another.."
3,need help please,we are reading this book in french for class and we desperately need help. if you have a translation or any insight it would be much appreciated merci beaucoup
5,Amazing,"I found the actual process to be fascinating. Of course, I like things with detailed instructions. I followed the directions exactly and the beer was actually some of the best I've ever had, better than Guinness in my opinion. I do recommend have quite a powerful stove though, the more water you heat in the first stage the better."
2,Not good quality,"This skirt is fine for mild usage, but fell apart more and more as we tried to use it in our theater production. It also is only for small children-- it wouldn't fit my 5th graders."
3,Good,"I usually find L Subramaniam's violin very boring, monotonous and repetitive. But this one is somewhat different from his other albums. My favourite in this one is Abhogi. It is brilliant. I wish he would play more familiar and typical ragas of south indian classical music such as Bhairavi, Thodi and Begada in his albums."
5,kid a or specimen b?,"my baby does the hanky-panky.Great album to play in Tangerian Opium dens, or at dinner parties clogged by societies' affluent effluent pavement fans, with their floppy fringes. Oh yes, it starts off harmlessly enough, collecting early Fall vinyl 7""'s, but then you start buying Faust bootlegs just for the digipack fist. Not a bad way to spent ten notes, two notes, or one note. yeah.Playing's better than 'Condemnation is Flex', nice stoner production there, 'Santa Dog is Boring' is almost unforgivable, no, i won't go there. Buy the new vinyl, no scratches, no santa dog is boring, no flower, a death valley and a 69 with lydia lunch. Feast or Foetus indeed."
5,Classic Cape Breton Fiddling at its Best,"This CD is homey and classic. Its archival value is beyond doubt. As a source for traditional tunes and technique it is rich and generous. For shere listening pleasure it is enchanting. With Cape Breton fiddling such a ""hot item"" these days, with the likes of ""bad boy"" Ashley and ""prom queen"" Natalie, it is refreshing to listen to lovingly nuanced, unpretentious fiddling with traditional back up, played as it has been for centuries in the main room of the place where the musician lived, intended for the pleasure of the moment with friends and family. Thank you, Rounder, for releasing this and other classic CDs."
5,Dar Is Delicious!,"I discovered Dar's music while I was in college. I could identify with the lyrics and appreciate her vocal abilities. I can't say that I have a favorite Dar Williams album, but When I Was A Boy, You're Aging Well and Flinty Kind Of Woman are among my favorite songs. I had the pleasure of seeing Dar in concert and meeting her afterwards. She is a phenomenal woman--very down to earth & kind. I would highly recommend this album and it is definitely a must have for Dar fans!"
5,Dar's best CD,"I am a huge Dar fan. Her lyrics are mindblowing and her vocals heartfelt...all the while the melodious guitar is strumming. This CD is so wonderful. There's not a song I don't love. Her songs on all her CDs are so meaningful. This CD in particular, though, has a simple beauty that moves me every time I listen to it.And while we're on the subject...go see Dar in concert... it is very much worth it.All the songs on the album are wonderful and meaningful in their own way. This CD is a necessary addition to your music collection."
4,Beautiful...,"folkie acoustic stuff! Dar weaves individual emotion and experience into her broader perception of modern society, making the lyrical content reminiscent of ani difranco, but with smoother edges. The reason I only gave it 4 stars is that it is my least favourite of her four albums. I still can't bear 'The babysitters here' with its cutsie nursery rhyme arrangement, but highlights like 'the great unknown' and 'mark rothko song' have that effect of draining you of emotion and overwhelming you with it at the same time. Check out her other albums and stuff by natalie merchant too if listening to Dar works out well for you!"
4,Math-A-Magic Multiplication (Math-A-Magic),"I bought this workbook for my third grader, who is having a little trouble with multiplication. He has been really enjoying the workbook. The workbook offers a unique way for the child to check his answers. I am very happy with this prochase."
3,It is what it is...,"...a cheap music stand, so it gets three stars instead of one. It is not made for packing around or heavy use. You have to be careful not to open it too far. It will not hold up to use by different people that have to adjust it often to their needs."
1,flimsy stand,"the stand was flimsy, but more importantly a wing nut was missing and the stand would not stay up. this was a gift and i was very unhappysharon burdge"
3,Such a Shame...,"This is one of my all-time favorite films. I waited years and years for it to come out in video, only to find out that the VHS version was the same version that had been unmercifully edited for commercial TV. I agree with the disappointment expressed by a previous reviewer, and can only hope that the complete version (with its exquisite ending) will be included if and when it comes out on DVD. That would be worth five stars to me!"
2,"Gone,Good Bye !","Remember New York before Starbucks,Donald Trump,24 year old millionaire traders and Disney at Times Square? I sure do. This film has excellent location filming and emits a wonderful male midlife crisis in full bloom.Sex and crime go together,so I'm told.If you are over 35 and remember the early 70's,wide ties and funk,get this movie and go back...It's better than here!However this is the SAME bad edited version that has been on cable recenly.Does MGM video watch the movies they release? NO.NO,NO! Movie 4 stars,Video 1 star."
1,WARNING,"Amazon has cross-linked two different films of similar name and year !One is the 1973 film ""Cops and robbers"" (Starring: Cliff Gorman, Joseph Bologna; Director: Aram Avakian) and the other is the 1973 film ""The Cops are Robbers"" (starring: Steve Railsback, James Keach).The first one is based upon Westlake's wonderful novel. The second is not.Be careful which you order - the same reviews are linked to BOTH."
5,Every thing a beginner needs...,"It took a week for the company to ship it and another to arrive but once I got a hold of it, i wasn't disappointed.Let me make it clear that I have never brewed before. That being said, this kit made the process fairly simple. Could have used some better directions but everything fit together and was well thought out. Give it a try, brewing is pretty fun.I recommend getting additional advice from people who have done this before and reading 'How to Brew' which is an free book by John Palmer. It is NOT necessary to buy this separately.Good luck."
5,An enjoyable read - make sure you get the whole series!,"This is the second in a five part series that really manages to blend history and full-blown fiction. Jacq's Egypt comes alive and jumps off the page, stealing you away to a world where magic might just be real and all those dry history stores come to life. I was really surprised at who ""the good guys"" and ""the bad guys"" turned out to be, and found myself really feeling for the characters in the pages. I highly recommend reading the series in order - you might just catch yourself rereading it, like I did ... wow, I just realized how cheezy that all sounds, but they really are great books."
4,Egypt's Finest.,"I picked this up for my love of Ancient Egypt, and enjoyed this winding tale immensely. Follows time fairly well, with the exception of the inclusion of Homer - but still. A wonderfully detailed installment to the series with great coverage of the founding of Egypt's pinnacle."
3,Could do better,"This author is undoubtedly a gifted story-teller. What irritates me is that he presents witchcraft and black magic as though they were real. One sorcerer throws a spell on Ramses'newly-born, and the baby can only be saved by another sorcerer called in by the Pharao! Other supernatural things happen throughout the book. Ramses himself performs miracles when he finds water in the middle of the desert. He also keeps a lion as a pet and regularly performs herculean feats. In my view, this takes away much of the educational value of the series. Historical novels may reflect the central part played by superstition in ancient societies, but legends should ultimately be seen to yield to rationality. This is why I think this book pales in comparison to, say, Gary Jennings'Aztec, or Noa Gordon's The Physician."
5,This book is great!,This is a wonderful continuation of the first volume. This is by far the best series I've ever read! The auther does a great job showing the feelings of all the charecters. This is one book I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU TO READ!!!
4,"An educational, enjoyable, escape back in time.","I pulled this book from the shelf and started reading. I was intrigued so I bought it. Jacq has captured the mood and spirit of ancient Egypt well. This is not a particularly difficult read and I believe if compares well (although not as good) with The River God and the Seventh Scroll. The characters are somewhat one dimensional, but all-in-all, an enjoyable read."
3,More Of The Same,"I'll give Christian Jacq this: you don't feel that disorientating gap between books. You smoothly go from the end of the first in this series, to page one of this story. It's a bit more spiritual than the last book. But Ramses is still that young, smart, brave, gorgeous, perfect human being he was before, and all the villians are still the sneaky, smarmy, nasty people they were before. About the only change here is that Moses is starting to question his goals in life, otherwise everyone is pretty predictable."
3,"Lots of education, a bit of sex with a twist of religion","This is a really nice collection. I enjoyed it very much. It is so very well researched in both historical and religious terms. Jacq was largely very faithful to historical facts. He made one enormous assumption with no historical backing whatsoever, that Ramses II was King of Egypt during the time of Moses. His history of Moses and the events of his life resemble those told in the bible and Quran, but in a secular fashion. The story does go on, but then again the man did rule Egypt for a very long and eventful period. There are indeed several cardboard like people in the book, very one dimensional and therefore very predictable. If you like history, suspense, lots of action, this is a great collection, enjoy it. If you are planning a Nile Cruise, or have just been on one, you must buy this."
3,Entertaining light read,"A five volume series may seem a daunting commitment but I assure you these are quick enjoyable reads. In the second installment, the young Ramses becomes Pharoah following his father's death and must build his own legacy. Surrounding by an interesting circle of friends and protectors (Moses, Setau the Snake charmer, a lion), Ramses organizes his faculty from unlikely persons, using instinct as much as intellect. His perspicaciousness, however, awkwardly misses the fact his brother, Shaanar, plots against him. In an interesting entanglment, Shaanar and others against Ramses become involved with a sorceror, Ofir, who claims to travel with the rightful heir to the throne, a descendant of Akhenaton, a pharoah who attempted to lead Egypt into monotheism.The dialogue can be a little too pat sometimes but the characters are entertaining enough to excuse this oversight that may be the fault of the translator. Recommended for those who like their fantasy a bit unconventional."
5,Even better than the first,"After plowing thorugh the first book, the second was just as blissful. Once again Jacq has captured his audience and guided them through another mystical journey. Although not historicaly acurate, it's fun to dream. You won't be disappointed"
4,"historical, but enteraining as well","I read both the Sun of Light and the Eternal Temple, and I found them to be very historically accurate as well as fun to read about. I am an grad. student studying Egyptology, and I thought these books would be a great for someone who did not know much about the history of Egypt."
4,I need volume III !,"When I visited France last summer ('97), Ramses were stacked high in the book store. It seemed everybody were hooked in this book. And now the waiting is over, it finally reached United States! I was impatient reading the first volume since we all knew Ramses is going to be a king. But now reading the second volume, I love it. It is easy to read since each chapters are short so I want to go on and on. However, I was rather disappointed since I learned from my French friend that the book is written in mysterious tone which I do not find it in the translation. I can't wait to read the sequal, Waner Book should at least publish semi-monthly."
3,A not storical book,I didn't like very much. I expected to read a storical book instead i have found a book nearly of all of fantasy. The book is also often boring and slow but it's good if you aren't intrested in the real story. It's also too long reading five books (very similar) before arriving at the end. I gave up at the 3rd.
2,Pretty Lame,"This CD is pretty lame. It starts off with a very forgettable 13:10 minute mix of the ""Hills of Katmandu"" by Tantra. Sylvester does ""You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real)"", and well, I love Sylvester. The Pet Shop Boys ""Always on My Mind"" mix is next, and I just found that particular mix a snooze fest. The next cut was a cover of the song ""Venus"" by Obsession. I'd never heard of this group. After I listened to this cover, I know why. First of all, if you're going to cover a song that's been around since the 60s, AT LEAST GET THE WORDS CORRECT. Lord love a duck, it's not: ""her weapons were her crystal eyes; making every man a MAN."" Good grief. The only other cut worth any attention was Rosabel's (Featuring Jennifer Holiday) mix of ""And I'm Telling You I'm Not Going.""I expect more out of a compilation CD and guys you cannot tell me that this is what's played all the time at all the clubs. No wonder I stopped going out. Just a little too cheesy and disco-y for me."
2,Save your money!,"I purchased this CD used after reading the reviews. Five stars are extremely difficult to earn, even for seasoned musicians. One can only assume that all the people who gave this CD a ""5 star"" rating were relatives.The songs consist of basic, repetitive chords and rhythms, combined with simplistic lyrics.This is not completely unpleasant music, but I find it something less than attention grabbing - seems more like the compositions of an amateur."
2,Less than Impressive,"I was rather disappointed with this cd. I guess I expected a lot more, especially after all the ""rave reviews"". If you really feel compelled to purchase this cd - make a copy or buy a used one!"
2,Only for the die hard Hemingway fan.,"This book, although kind spirited, is only for the die hard Hemingway fan who must read everything, true or false, about the man. I found this book to be tedious at times and sometimes just simply less than truthful. At the end I felt that the authors attempted to pull the wool over my eyes but were unsuccessful, even though I was a willing participant and wished to believe their outlandish stories. ..."
2,Watch the movie,"T.E. Lawerence was certainly an extraordinary figure in history based on his achievements with the Arabs during WWI but not all heroes are great writers and Lawrence is NOT a good writer. Do yourself a favor and get a book on Lawrence of Arabia by a professional history writer or although not exactly historically correct (but close enough) watch the fabulous movie ""Lawrence of arabia"". You will still get the true feeling of what it was like back then and what Lawrence was trying to accomplish. His book will just confuse the reader."
1,Seven pillars of wisdom,"The book is, of course, one of the classics of all time. Lawrence's prose is compelling as he unfolds his story of the revolt. His descriptions of the natural landscape are some of the best ever. The problem is this edition. They obviously used optical scanning and the book is full of errors. Spelling is terrible; sentences either do, or do not, end when they should; paragraphs, too, are disjointed. And if the editing and proofreading of the text weren't bad enough, the binding broke one-quarter of the way through the book. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!"
1,Poorly produced,"Do not buy this particular version of Seven Pillars. There are about four or five typos on every page, and it is very distracting. Whole words are missing in some cases. I don't know why the publisher couldn't have proofread it. I also found the very large format awkward to hold and read. So buy a version published by someone else."
4,Learning the Arab way,"For me, the complexity of the Middle East seemed unfathomable. By reading this book, carefully, delving into the author's text, I have a better understanding of the people of the Middle East and their many tribes and cultural ways. I also can begin to understand their rivalries and methods of dealing with each other. It is a very complex society that will take the USA years to understand and deal with."
4,Heavy going but fascinating,"A very heavy-going, but fascinating read by a legendary character. I'm no history buff but this book is not just a simple ""history book"" either. This book contains his entire life during his involvement in the Arabic conflict. It's as if you were living those times through his eyes. His writing can be confusing, but persevere and you will be rewarded."
1,Do not order this edition by BN Publishing!,"This particular printing is very disappointing because it's so full of misprints that it becomes difficult to read. What's more disappointing is that you soon realize that this entire book was scanned from some other copy, and then printed without anyone taking the time to look at it, much less proof read it. Do not order this edition by BN Publishing!Don't be fooled by the nice cover. Get yourself a copy from another publisher!"
5,The best tortured heroic Imperial England ever produced,"Those us trapped in late Twentieth Century technical society, bored but well-fed, sometimes wish for the courage and circumstance to take up arms and shed the blood of colonial oppressors, if there were any, blood, oppressors, or colonies. T.E. Lawrence had the sort of unhappy childhood (bastard, public school) that seems attractive if you're not personally part of it, and Languages at Oxford, among which a noted translation of Homer, and Arabic, which got him into interesting times in Ottoman Palestine. Lawrence saw no reason not to fight and kill in a field belonging to Arabs, and he brought strategy and resource to the Arab liberation, and suffering and glory to himself. He helped bring the Arabs their freedom, aided the British cause, hurt the Turks and their allies the Germans, all in the desert, among the ferocious tribes. Bully. Mark Bergsei"
5,"As promised, prompt delivery","I received this old book, bearing the scars of time on the dust jacket. Inside it looks old but in perfect integrity, a great buy, a jewel of historical value. After reading I'll update the review."
3,Seven Pillars,"The book in its depth, scope and subject matter reminds me of A Bright and Shining Lie. As with that book, it suffers from an overload of details that are distracting to someone unfamiliar with the events. I'm sure that to so one more intimately familiar with the historical events of the time the book would be a fascinating and informative read. I though came away with the most from the chapters that stuck with broader historical and political commentary, rather than the specific names of who slept in what tent when, who owned which camel (and said camel's gender) and what ulitmately killed the camel (mange, dehydration, neglect, etc)."
4,Seven Pillars of Wisdom: A Triumph,"Excellent writing by T.E. Lawrence, aka Lawrence of arabia. Plethora of detail and a wicked insight to the intricacies of Arab politics, tribal fiefdoms, and the complexities of a little know aspect of WW I, i.e. the British attempt to arouse the Arabs against Turkey, to take some of the pressure off the Brits vs Germany."
5,Great book...I think!,"Read ""Hero"" by Michael Korda. A biography of T.E. Lawrence, ""Lawrence of Arabia"". This book played a somewhat large role in his book so I decided to buy it. ""Lawrence of Arabia"", the film, is my all-time favorite film and I consider it the greatest film ever made. So I was very intrigued to read Korda's biography of Lawrence. This book was then a must have. I haven't read it yet but I'm sure I'll love it!"
5,Uplifting...,"""Seven Pillars"" is both vibrant and introspective. Lawrence portrays his Arab acquaintances sensitively and his own exploits without pretense. This book is a must."
2,Seven Pillars of Wisdon. T.E.Lawrence,"Have not yet fully read the book, only 5%, but the diction and use of the English language is beautiful"
3,Lawerence of arabia made difficult,"a personal account of an interesting part of WWI, account of how the west undermine the Ottoman empire and set up many of our current mid east problems, promises made and promises not kept. The Language is dated and from a a now dead culture some times difficult to understand if you have an interest in the subject a good account but if you don't know the subject it is a difficult read."
3,Long Read,"After reading Lawrence's biography, I decided to read 7PW as a follow up. I guess Churchhill's comment as one of the great literary masterpieces in the English language is accurate, if Lawrence didn't use each and every word in the English language. I am a slow reader, am still plowing thru the last 100 or so pages, with the exasperating level of detail in the book begging me to skim to the end. Never the less, this book by a knowledgable and literary author with a flair for elaborately describing his experiences provides a vivid account of a time and part of the world few could visit."
2,Badly scanned ocr version with many errors,"This book if full of misspellings, garbled and wrongly interpreted words (media vs. Medina). Very annoying to have to pause frequently to try to figure out if a word is misspelled, garbled, or beyond my vocabulary. Very inadequate proofreading."
3,The 99 Cent Edition Includes Maps,"While this edition provides the full text of Col. Lawrence's story of the Arab revolt, the 99 cent Kindle book has more features, maps, and pictures."
1,"""Scientific findings"" seemed to be backed by little (if any) research, and supported mostly by bigotry and biased opinions.","""Scientific findings"" seemed to be backed by little (if any) research, and supported mostly by bigotry and biased opinions.Section on ""Homosexuals"" was at the least disheartening and very disappointing. It should be no suprise that Americas older generations are, for the most part, close-minded and scared of anyone a little different. Glad this is no longer being published, and I have thrown my copy in the trash where I personally believe it belongs."
3,Pretty good for such a short book,"Mostly a history of Billy Joel's recordings - lots of nitty gritty talk. It was almost like reading a series of album covers. Still, there was a good bit of biographical information. I'd like to see a more complete biography with more human interraction. For example, I wanted to learn about Jerry Schilling's involvement, but there was no mention of him. Schilling was a member of Elvis's Memphis Mafia who went on to be Joel's road manager according to an Elvis biography."
5,I LIKE YOU CD,I BOUGHT THIS CD FOR JUST A FEW SONGS. FOUND THAT I REALLY LIKED MOST OF THEM. THANK TOY FOR THE PROMPT SERVICE
4,Where Did Phyllis Go?,"In the mid to late 80's this lady was very popular and then suddenly she just disappeared. I cannot understand why she did not go on to have a more successful career? The big hit on here is ""I Like You"" which was a great dance tune at the clubs. My personal favorite is ""It's Tonight"" where she really lets it loose vocally. One song missing is ""Face The Music"" which was a fun little song that appeared on the album but has never resurfaced on a CD compilation of her work? For a stroll down memory lane 80's style I recommend Phyllis Nelson."
4,Phylliss Nelson,"Phyliss died in the early nineties of an unknown illness. ""I Like You"" will be remembered as possibly the best HI NRG tune of the 80s."
2,Skins Down Under,This is a pretty good movie for the time and the budget. This is Russell Crowe before he was 'RUSSELL CROWE'. He gives a great performance as a dedicated skinhead/white supremacist. If you liked movies like American History X this is a good companion piece. It is pretty violent so not for everybody.
4,none of us even knew exsisted?,"I'm into alot of sub-culture/underground type films and this is a great movie. I only gave it 4 stars though for following the ever popular trend of nazi skinheads so glorified and exploited by the likes of Morton Downey and Geraldo Rivera to boost ratings on their half baked daytime talk shows. If this movie more accuratly portrayed the ska/oi/hardcore/skinhead sub-culture, this may have been on my top 10 list. Russell Crowe does a great job and honestly this movie is the reason I'm willing to check out all his other movies, if he can take on a topic such as this and still win you over, he must be doing his job pretty well."
4,Russell Crowes break out role.,"Hard film to watch, very graphic. But Russell did a fantastic job in this role, I am now convinced after seeing the majority of his films that he could play just about any role there is and make it believable. If you like his other films, such as Gladiator, Insider, you will definitely appreciate his performance in this film."
4,Why does a movie need a moral?,"This is a gritty potrayal of Australian racists, and should be applauded for having the balls to let you watch the proceedings without shoving a message down your throat. If people are so stupid they can't figure out racism is bad without a film telling them so, then they probably won't be watching this, anyway.Romper Stomper is much, much better then the over-rated, over-hyped American History X that, despite great performances by Balk and Norton, still played like a cross between an after- school special and a straight-to-video prison movieIf you get a chance, also worth watching is Wright's Metal Skin."
5,An instant cult hit. . .,"""Romper Stomper"" is definitely in my 'top ten of all time' list. . . it explores the sicko world of nazi skinheads (NOT the same as traditonal, non-racist skinheads) and exposes how horrible and ultimately destructive racial hatred is. Any true collector of cult has at least one copy in their collection."
4,Blatant !!,The Australians have a way of laying out the hard core center without overdoing the frills. This movie is really quite fantastic in its portrayal of a bunch of racist punks who just dont get it and arent likely to get it anytime soon. It is entertaining. I like it.
3,"1 Dimentional, but good for that","Lots of violence, but you don't really care. It's the bad guy skinheads against the perfectly innocent: Vietnamese, gay hobos, and rich paedophile. There's no attempt to understand the characters, just make 'em stupid-- it's enough.That said, the pacing and structure of the film ARE interesting. I found my heart beating fast despite myself. The scenes are well done, and the main actors did what they could with the skimpy material. I recommend the VHS version rather than the DVD version which evidently censors the sex scenes. Those would be a shame to miss. --Mykel"
3,"THE LIST OF ""EXTRAS"" IS A LITTLE MISLEADING!","the movie itself is very good, but i think the list of extra features is deceiving. the ""documentary"" about skinheads and the ""making of"" sound nice, but it's nothing more than a head-and-shoulders interview with the director...not what most would consider a traditional ""documentary"". he just basically talks about the homework he did before making the film: collecting 56 hours of interviews from former members of skinhead gangs. HOWEVER, none of these interviews are shared. and it's basically the same story with the ""making of"". all in all, the extras are not fun at all so don't waste your money if you don't have to."
3,Fails to Finish,"A lot of interest will probably be following Russell Crowes earlier movies , with the release of ""Gladiator"", and here his acting talents are pretty clear. A graphic and often disturbing depiction of neo nazi thugs in contemporary Australia, this movie is not for the faint hearted. The overiding message of the futility of violence is masterfully delivered without ever being patronising, and an excellent support cast bring the movie a freshness often missing in films today. Being something of a budget movie it was greeted with rave reviews but unfortunately, after building nicely it seems t the Director either ran out of ideas, or money and the storyline seems to end abruptly and almost unexpectantly - leaving you a little frustrated. This is a good movie, and worth seeing, but be prepared for some disappointments."
3,Deceptive Advertising!!!,"While I loved the digital widescreen transfer of this film (so much better than VHS), I do have a bone to pick with this DVDs' producers.This ""Special Edition"" DVD advertises on it's back cover a pair of documentaries...one about Skinheads and the other (it would seem) regarding the making of the film. On the surface this sounds like a great deal - something unexpected for such a small film. But after you've cracked the case - watched the feature you bought it for - you'll come to find out that the two ""documetaries"" that are listed to be on Disc 2 are actually interview topics with director Geoffery Wright. No documentaries. No lie.Well, that's unless you're talking about Fox, it's producer.It's sad when a sale closing device, like the DVD special feature is either abused or badly mishandled. While the movie is well-worth the price of the disc, it is a letdown when the cool stuff you've been looking forward to actually turns out to be bogus."
2,The difference between the versions,"I rented ""Romper Stomper"" a few years ago and recently this DVD edition has been available at Wal-Mart for under $8. It lacks all the extra features except the commentary and cuts out some of the more explicit sex scene shots by using a zoomed in pan-and-scan effect. Regardless of the content in this scene this is just a bad altering of the original film and I don't buy a film to get a broadcast TV look. Buy the other edition if you can find it."
4,GREAT MOVIE!!!,"FIRST OF ALL, I BOUGHT THIS MOVIE WITHOUT RENTING IT FIRST - DEFINITELY NOT A WASTE OF MONEY!!!IT SHOWS (IN MY OPINION) THE STUPIDITY OF RACIST BELIEFS AND THE VIOLENCE THAT RESULTS FROM THEM. THE ONLY THING THAT COULD HAVE MADE IT BETTER WAS SHOWING A BIT MORE OF THE ASIAN COMMUNITY'S SIDE OF THE MOVIE.THE ONLY SAD THING ABOUT THIS MOVIE IS THE DEATH OF THE ACTOR THAT PLAYS DAVEY (FROM SUICIDE ABOUT A YEAR AFTER THE MOVIE WAS MADE - SEE BIO NOTES ON THE DVD). IT WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT TO SEE HIM AND RUSSELL CROWE WORK TOGETHER AGAIN OR JUST HIM IN ANOTHER MOVIE."
5,Awesome!,"Great customer service, product was delivered within reasonable time frame although they had more time to do it. Item came as promised, no surprises. Will buy from this seller again:)"
1,LET'S STOMP ON THIS RACIST NONSENSE!,"As an Australian I am deeply embarrassed to see this cow of a movie being offered for sale in the US and Canada. Not to put too fine a point on it, this movie stinks. Deeply disturbing, overblown to the point of self-parody this movie virtually endorses the sick rantings of extreme racists and homophobes. There is no sign of condemnation of their activities, this movie shows a happy community oblivious to society's disapproval. The fact that one of the lead actors committed suicide one month after the movie's release in Australia probably says it all. Russell Crowe is still trying to live this down. A year after RS (oh, how appropriate!) came out he played an openly gay man in The Sum of Us and went on TV in Australia to try and soften his image. Thankfully he has gone on to bigger and better things (Virtuosity, LA Confidential, etc). Take my advice and give Romper Stomper a big miss."
3,DEFINITELY A STOMPER,"I gave this movie 3 stars based solely on the historic value of a very early Russell Crowe performance. No doubt he was working out then. Eye Candy. The rest is a low grade skin head romp. I do not, necessarily, have an aversion to violence (ie Taxi Driver and like kind) but this is a grade B movie, at best. For me, it was a waste."
4,Disturbing,"This film gives you a peek into a life most people know nothing about. It is about a gang of Nazi skinheads. What I really liked about this film was the way it was handled. It does not glorify these skinheads, nor does it apologize for them. It is a disturbing topic. Inspite of myself, I became absorbed in this story of hate-filled, racist skinheads. As I mentioned, it doesn't glorify the lifestyle. You won't watch it and then run out and shave your head. It doesn't have a Disney ending where everyone realizes the error of their ways and becomes upstanding citizens. For this I respect this film even though I don't agree with the views."
5,"great movie, bad specials","i love this movie, but the extras are terrible. My copy doe not have the documentary that it says it's supposed to. does anyone else's have it included? I'm trying to contact Fox about it but i can't find contact information..."
4,Hate/Fear or Love which is the most violent?,How many people got this?Reviewer: death66@mailexcite.com (jacob klein) from Cleveland OH excellent film telling age old stories. the fight for territory. and the fight for love. The skinhead aspect of the movie is secondary to the underlying themesThis movie deals with a lot more than violence. Even the most hateful person shows real caring. The most vile person I found was Gabrielle's father. Worth watching again.
2,Disappointing movie,I had heard of this movie and I am a big fan of Russell Crowe so I purchased it. Not a very good movie and a waste of time. Crowe does a good job but the story is rather weak.
5,This movie is strait forward and i love it,Like i said its a strait forward movie but if your one of those people who can't handle the truth as it is i wouldn't recamend it! its fairly violent but not enough to make my stomach turn! anyway you should watch it to expand your horizons or just because!
1,What is the point?,"Yes, it is visceral, raw, and brutal.... It also has no point of view or insight. It is very disturbing, shocking, and, ultimately I'd have to say, hateful."
1,Pointless and predictable.,I was really disappointed with this film. It depicts a group of angry and disorganized skinheads living on the streets in Melbourne (Australia) who ultimately meet their demise. The plot is thin and for that reason the movie features multiple scenes with either violent assaults or amateur pornography. If you're looking for a thought-provoking film about white supremacy or Neo-Nazis you'll want to pass this one up.
5,Must see,This movie was called a lessor version of A Clockwork Orange. The reviewer had it wrong. Romper Stomper is a nice updated version without the digusting scene. While Romper Stomper is in no way tame - the violence is showed in it's true context. The characters bleed and they are not immune to emotions. What really drew me in was the realistic manner in which all the characters where protrayed. You almost wanted a happy ending - but of course sick people who can't tell the difference between right and wrong don't end up happy.
4,Terrifying and intense story of skinheads in Oz,"Russell Crowe plays the leader of a gang of Australian skinheads in this intense and frightening tale of racism, destruction, and a hopeless kind of life. The fight sequences are hard to watch, but if you stick with it, it will stick with you."
5,This movie is powerful!,I saw this movie when it came out in '92 and right away I fell in love with the powerful presence and aura of Russell Crowe. He was a no name in the states then though.This movie takes you for a wild ride! It's a must see...Russell Crowe is one of the foremost acting talents of the age.
5,If you like paintball you'll love this,"Frankly, I knew very little about how elaborate some of the bigger competitions are. I was familiar with paintball only as something my brothers and I had done a couple of times on a much smaller scale in much smaller venues.This is the big time. A weekend at West Point and featuring countless players. Even if paintball isn't as a big a deal to you as it is to these guys (and you might be surprised how big a deal it is to them) this will definitely entertain you and make you want to play."
5,I love All Things Iona,"Another wonderful, captivating work by Iona! Wonderful instrumentation. A great addition to our Iona collection."
3,good,"One of their strangest works, one of the best too. The songs are quite long for residents songs, and are given a chance to develop. Wacky words and tunes."
5,'Welcome to the offshoots of Jupiter',"This is the Residents second full length recording that was not to be released until its creator's had completely forgotten about its existence. The theory of obscurity in full effect. It was later released by the Residents management in order to fulfill contractual obligations after the Residents had disappeared with the master tapes of 'Eskimo'-- just days before Eskimo was to be pressed. Haunting, beautiful and bizarre. A certain kind of sadness prevails through most of the album with the Residents using a 5 part tone poem to ask some questions 'guaranteed to shake you up'. The album lets us take a peek at the Residents behind the eyeball masks where they ponder their own decision to live in obscurity.'To exist to show or to be shown is a question never, never known' There is an innocence and beauty to this album that can't be understated. Absolutely essential."
5,A Must Read!,"John blends his background, humor, facts and common sense opinions into a must read book. To get this kind of perspective from someone in the entertainment industry is refreshing to be sure."
5,Great new artists,"I first listened to the CD after hearing about them through friends. The album consists of a good mix of sounds-I wish there were more than five songs. The music was original and the words had great meaning. As most new artists, these guys don't get enough credit- they are easily better than most bands coming out now! (Broken Record is a great song!) These guys look and sound awesome!"
5,Pleasant Surprise,"Walked into the Stone Pony in Asbury Park to see Stryper and walked out with Parmalee's CD. I was blown away by the band, which played back-up. My husband, who I dragged to the concert kicking and screaming, loved them. The songs are great and their stage presence and performance was top notch. Pick up the CD, wait for the new one coming early next year, and catch Parmalee on tour...you will not be disappointed!"
4,Super sharp,My 4th Mundial knife and I was not disappointed. I own some √ºber expensive knives but don't use a boning knife often enough to drop a ton of dough on one. Works beautifully. Great value
2,NO! You can't do this to FLA songs and get away with it!,"GAH! Bought this one when it came out in 1996, as I buy every album with FLA on. Well, this is the worst of all my FLA album. Why, Die Krupps has made a mess of all of the FLA songs. Literally killed all that is FLA and warped it into something gruesome and horrible. I have never been able to listen through these songs. Yes they are that bad! The FLA mixes of Die Krupps are quite ok, therefore the 2 stars. Most stuff FLA mixes becomes great, but this time they must have been in a hurry. Oh Well. Spend your money on another CD. Why not Implode, if you do not have it :-)"
4,Die Construction Revamped Assembly Wins,"As a Fan of DarkWave music, I found this gem for $ at the KUZ in Germany sitting with Remix 1,3&4 and bought them all. Each track does both justice to the original band and the general listner by showing how it could sound if reshaped by a turntablist (DJ), as a DJ I always enjoy finding a new spin on any song to be able to re-introduce a great song to those who might have missed the original. Purists might disagree but an updated version made me dig deeper into the used bins to track down the original hit to compare.Highly recommend!"
5,Great Christmas gift!,I bought this T-shirt for my godfather. He looks just like Jerry Garcia and is in the music business. He loves the shirt. It is very unique.
4,Listen to the true fans,"Anyone who has been a fan of Coti since he first came onto the music scene (2003- Antes que ver el sol) will appreciate his new album, ""Gatos y Palomas."" It's light, it's fun, and it's enjoyable music. The only issue that I have with it is that he does a little too much storytelling, talking about his grandfather and his people in Argentina, but it's not that bad. My favorite tracks are, of course, ""Cancion de adios"" and also ""Sueltame."" Overall, it's a good record."
3,this is a great band from the 80th,"Johnny Hates Jazz - sounds just a little weird for the name of the band but besides that everything is unbelievable. This particular CD is not really ""The very best of ..."", it lacks more than one song."
5,Fine costume,"We bought this for a costume for a play. It was true to size and very durable. The black on the shirt is made of a pleather like material which looks cool but was hard for my son to get used to - and it was hot under the stage lights to wear a shirt under it - but is good if you need to be outside for Halloween. It looks really, really cool. It does not come with a sword or an eyepatch."
4,Nice costume for a boy,"The costume arrived on time and my son loved it. Of course there is no sword that goes with it, but they are not allowed that in school any way. Overall, the costume worked out fine, though since my son borders on having to use husky pants, the pants were a little tight, but he said he had no issues. The costume does get warm in the sun but I think that is a good thing in October."
2,Rubies Pirate Costume,We had this costume just a week and the pants got a huge hole in the crotch area. Not long after that it go a hole in the arm pit. I can say it was not worth the money. Poor workmanship. Wish I could have gotten a refund or something.
1,Stupid Pirate Costume,"We got 2 costumes for Halloween, this one and a Doctor. They were the same price. The Doc costume was quality fabric with pockets and lots of accoutrements. This pirate costume looked like it might be nice, but up close it's a super cheap and cheesy costume. The shirt and belt is all just printed on the front on thin material. I saw the same one at Wall Mart and at the time it hadn't arrived and I thought ""Thank goodness we didn't buy a cheap one that looks like that!"" Then I was disappointed to see that exact one arrive."
3,Pirate costume,My son loves it but he complains the top is very itchie. The top is also to big for him but the pants fit fine due to the elastic waste.
5,Great for the price!!!,"Bought this for my son for his 5th ""pirate"" birthday party! This costume was great and he wasn't the only one wearing it! He will be wearing it again for halloween!!"
5,great custom for price,"I purchased this for my 5 year for Halloween and dress up. I came in 2 days and was great. We ordered a small for my 5 year old and it fit over his clothes nicely. the shirt is stong material and looks good and the pants are very light weight, but haven't ripped yet. It cames with 2 scarfs to go with the the outfit. it does NOT come with the sword. Worth the money! My kids are still playing in it 4 weeks after Halloween"
4,The Best CD Title in the World,"Even the great title isn't necessary - Big Black were so cool that they could sell anything. This hate-rock band pumped out a few drum-machine hardcore albums before giving up a few years back, and this retrospective offers some of their best tracks ever, including the nihilistic veteran's story ""Bazooka Joe"" and most of the rest of the ""Atomizer"" album, as well as other harsh tracks like :""Grinder' and ""Ready Men."" If you've always wanteds to own a Big Black album, this is the one to get."
2,Ugh...,"Another case of nothing really better around so it must have been GREAT, right? Albini as a writer was kind of cool, but Big Gack was always a little skimpy sounding and certainly robotic in a NOT GOOD way. Sounds like Metal Urbain from 5 - 10 years earlier, but that stuff had way more punch, fuzz and grit (besides catchier songs) and those guys were FRENCH for chrissakes!!! This stuff sounds sort of weak now and not sure Albini really ""meant"" any of this - just needed something to do and being in a band was ""cool"", so there you have it. Having said that, the ""Bulldozer"" stuff is OK on it's own."
5,Just want to clear up a couple things,"Not sure where other reviewers got their weird info, but:- this is not a live album (though there is 1 live track)- Atomizer (first 9 songs) was an LP not an EP- the other tracks are from singles, not EPsAlso, just a curious note: The original Atomizer LP contained one track that is NOT included on this CD release: ""Strange Things"". Not a big loss though."
5,Ironically accessible primal rage with a relentless beat,"These tracks from Atomizer are some of my favorites- ever. So many half-baked ""punk"" or ""hardcore"" acts never came close to the kind of primal outpouring Big Black delivers. Simple yet meanigful lyrics round out the package. If this album doesn't get you in touch with your dark side and leave you grinning with pulse racing, then you are a vacuous boob! Their vinyl albums were truly a package experience, full of extra demented treats. I'm not sure what's in the CDs.Also get Hammer Party. If you're still game, try Songs aout fucking too, although I can't recommend it as highly."
4,Good,"Delivery was slower than I hoped but within the time limit aloted. Product was great, just as described."
2,"easily J.Y's weakest material, a few decent songs is all is here","the subject line pretty much says it all. Sounds like J.Y. was just goofing around. There are a couple decent songs for that point in time, but nothing that stands the test of time. J.Y. was certainly Styx's best guitarist and he had some great songs singing lead with them too (ie: Midnight Ride, Snowblind, Eddie, Half-Penny Two Penny, Double Life, Miss America etc, not to mention singing most of the bext songs on Styx' 1st four albums when he sang 50/50 with Dennis), but for solo stuff stick with Into the Fire & City of Holy Faith from his Raised By Wolves cd and also Still Feel Your Love from his City Slicker cd."
2,Sorry fans not his best but ok!,"If this were his first solo release i'd say it was just ok but this being his second and City Slicker being soo much better and especially with the Styx harmony vocals prevailent throughout that, i'd say don't start with this release and was highly disappointed after many listens.JY never was more than a fine guitar player in Styx and the tunes he did vocal on were ok tunes at best so don't hate the writer but City Slicker is the solo release to have by JY.On a side note: Go see the Dennis DeYoung-less version of Styx for it's awesome live show...They definately rock harder than when Dennis was with them. His replacement is ok and sounds similiar but Dennis is still the best.And of course Tommy Shaw is pretty darn good these days."
2,"Where was the ""science advisor"" for this movie?","I have little to add to the comments of other reviewers concerning characterization, intraction between them, and so on. But I had an extremely hard time getting past the movie being wrong about just about every scientific premise. For one thing, the earth's magnetic field is constantly going through a cycle of gradually increaing to a maximum value, declines (gradually) until it reaches zero, increases (gradually and with opposite polarity) then starts decreasing again. We are now in a ""decreasing"" mode.It is true that cosmic rays will not be deflected by a weakened EM field but it will be nothing like a blowtorch hitting a peach (as described in the movie.) There might be more cancers and mutations over a period of centuries but absolutely nothing like what was shown in this movie.My advice: love or hate the movie to your heart's content but PLEASE do not base any scientific knowledge from it!"
4,End of the world movie,"this is another end of the world movie with a slightly different twist. Since I like these kind of movies I enjoyed it, but it might be to much for some to swallow."
1,YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING!,"The only way the production of this movie can be justified is if it were an intentional put-on. The acting is so over-the-top corny that, if meant to be serious, should be the subject of a criminal indictment. Unbelievably bad."
2,Empty Hole,"Journeyman director Jon Amiel, who gave us COPYCAT and THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO LITTLE looks like he's gone for B-movie territory somewhere between cliche-ridden disaster movie and tounge-in-cheek action. The special effects do look impressive, and it could be one of those dumb but fun popcorn munching flicks. But with a no-name cast (Except for Hilary Swank) and non-existent plot, this is one of the few upcoming movies that could go both ways. Not that many people care though."
5,And I Thought I Only Loved Horror Movies,There is only one word for this movie. AWESOME! The characters in this film are very developed. Though this is kind of a science fiction action there are no boring parts. Hilary swank was awesome in this film.The Plot was Awesome. The earth stops rotation so 6 select people are going to the core to give it a boost so that the earth can heal itself again.There were really sad moments in this movie on account of great character development.There is also a guy who dies in order for the rest to continue on thier journey.This movie had me sitting back in my seat and eyes focused only on the screen. It made me feel like i was one of the people in the ship. Awesome movie awesome cast awesome effects i wish i could give this movie a 10! sweet dreams....
1,the producers were drunk when they made this movie,"Most off the scientific facts are wrong. The earth's center is as big as Mars!!!!!! Come on!!!!!! Maybe as big as Moon. Under the Earth's ground is liquid magma. Its liquid because off the pressure, and its not possible to under it. The Producers obviously forget about food supplies, and oxygen. The only smart thing on which producers remembered is that the atomic bomb is activated with usual bomb that needs air. I think that this is the only realistic thing."
1,The preview looks stupid!,The preview of this film strongly suggests that this is going to be Armeggedon underground. Just the preview was so stupid!!! Don't see this movie at all! Just plain don't!
3,mediocre scifi,"Unfortunately, I was very disappointed by this film. I was looking for hard scifi, something that is entirely plausible, yet projected into a fascinating future. Red Planet comes to mind, as does Andromeda Strain: you can really believe the story if you are knowledgeable about science, at least while you're watching it.This film starts promisingly: there are mysterious catastrophes that are linked to man's messing with the Earth's core. They have to fix it. Unfortunately, what they come up with is what can only be called a magical technology: a ray to cuts anything, and a material (for a tunneling device) that is more or less infinitely strong. Once this magic is established, it has to succeed.The characters are the strongest part, as the actors are really good. Also, some of the underground locales are fun. But this isn't good hard scifi.Not recommended, unless you want action rather than hard scifi."
5,So awful it good,"This may be one of the worst movies ever made. But its so bad that it is amazing. I actually paid to see it twice in the theater because after the first time i didnt believe what i actually had seen. It got even funnier the second time. The birds flying into everything, Lindo's classic line ""50 billion dollars""...does it get any better??? And remember HIllary Swank made this between Boys Dont Cry and Million Dollar Baby and they didnt take her Oscar away. That is incredible. If you havent seen this you are depriving yourself of one of the most unintentionally funny movies ever."
