1,"Too many statistics, boring , reads like a text book,",This book delivers nothing as promised in its advertising. It is filled with lots of uninteresting statistics. Any one with average common sense can reach the same conclusions. The book is too long on platitudes. There are no discussions of actual experiences or encounters.I reuturned the book for a refund.
3,"A Companion Piece to ""The Ethical Slut""","""Threesome"" is targeted at people who have wanted to create a threesome, but have been unable to do so. It offers next to nothing for people who are aleady involved in alternative relationships.The psychological techniques the author suggests to help women explore their sexuality, and find out if others are receptive, is very valuable, but I can't condone her inference that deception is acceptable in this endeavor. My recommendation would be to read this book only as a companion piece to ""The Ethical Slut,"" by Dossie Easton and Catherine A. Lizt, which explains the ethics of alternative sexuality in a more comprehensive way."
3,It's Not Easy Being Three,"The book was helpful and had practical advice, but it acknowledges there are no easy ways for a man to get two women to join him in bed. It takes a lot of work, patience, luck and most of all a willing female partner. If you are short on any of these attributes, then save your money. Also, there is a promise of a secret code. The book fails to deliver any such code or even suggest what the code is or how it might work. So do not buy the book based on any mistaken belief that you will gain access to some secret information that will bring dozens of potential partners to your bed. I was fooled, don't you be. By the way, the book did not work for me, although for the most part I enjoyed reading it."
5,Best book on Threesomes,"I'll keep this simple. The book was very helpful for both my wife and myself. Since it was written by a woman, Lori takes in the concerns of a woman. As far as helping a man guide his way to this experience the book gave direction, wisdom, and good advice. I would recommend this book to anyone in search of this experience or for a woman who is BI curious and needs some good advice and how to have a good first experience. Thanks Lori!"
1,No love,"I was very excited to be purchasing ""Love and Human Remains""- it is a video that I loved when I first saw it. Unfortunately, the dvd does not play. It isn't scratched, cracked, or damaged in any way that I can see with the naked eye. It just does not play. Bummer."
3,It's not a Region 1 disc,"To let other buyers beware, this DVD is NOT a region 1 DVD. Love and Human Remains has never been released on Region 1 DVD. This WILL play on an all region DVD player."
5,The Game that I've always wanted,After playing a lot of games this one has kept my interest and keeps me coming back for more. No matter what level you want to play at Mindrover keeps delivering challenging play and cool graphics. The most interesting thing is after you design your vehicle you sit back and let it do it's work. I find myself cheering for the robot that I created.Mindrover I believe is a break out game.
5,"Wow, this spotlight will blind you!","Wow, I never knew a spotlight could shine soooooooo bright, with 2 million candelpower damn you can't go wrong. I recommend this spotlight for anyone who hunts in the jungle or just feels the need to buy an extremely bright flashlight like what those cops use, you will see from now till then. Thanks Motor Trend."
5,Moral Cowardice,"This book is more than a technical problem and its resolution. The book provides a window into the lack of moral courage by senior naval officers to address an issue involving the wellbeing of the american sailor. Basicly, the navy could not identify a techincal cause for the explosion so it must be a sailor's fault. Thus find a victum to hang the cause on and what better way than to point a finger at a ""queer"". ( Queer = anyone whose lifestyle is not in keeping with the excepted standard as interpeted by Senior Naval Officers.) So the reputation of a sailor is destroyed and the 16 in. guns can continue to fire. The final result of the incident aboard the Iowa is the realization by sailors that the U.S.Navy will not hesitate to debase the honor and reputation of an individual within the Navy so long as the ""mission"" is accomplished.The Navy now wonders why the re-enlistment rate is so poor!"
5,violin and guitar beautifully blended,"I would strongly recommend this cd to any one who is a lover of violin and classical guitar. It blends the two so beautifully. Everyone I have played this cd for absolutely fell in love with it. This is soothing, yet exciting classical music..stirs the soul and tugs at your heart. Fernandez gently strums the guitar complementing the plaintive perfection of Markov's violin."
1,No one has a clue on how to pack!,"I ordered this because I needed a replacement for one of my stems. When the package arrived, I knew as soon as I picked up the box that it was broken because I could hear the pieces rattling around. After opening the box I couldn't believe what I found. The single stem was wrapped in a piece of corrugated cardboard and just lying on top of a piece of bubble wrap. Like this was supposed to protect a fragile piece of crystal from the rigors of shipping! What an extreme disappointment. I will be returning the pieces of the glassware.I concur with the previous reviewer and wonder if this is a problem with the supplier. If so, Amazon needs to drop them like a hot potato. I have shopped with Amazon for years and this is the first problem I have had with something being broken. And to see the problem with two customers right in a row with the same product, I have to wonder what is going on!"
1,CAN'T PACK THIS!!!!!!!,"I think this was more a vendor issue than a product issue. When my package arrived I was very exited because it got here very quick, and It was for a Christmas dinner party. That excitement did not last. I opened a box of broken glass all 12 of them. No one wrapped them or padded them they just lied them in a box. I called Amazon who was very helpful and they re shipped no promises of getting here before christmas but they did. I was so happy until I opened the box, again no packing or padding just thrown in there. All broken. I makes no sense. I stlll had a great Christmas despite not having my fancy glasses. I will say from what I could tell they would have been beautiful if not broken. Just use a different vendor. MB from OH"
5,I can't do without it now that I've been using it.,"The sponge cloth felt a bit strange when I first used it, but now, I can't go back to a regular washcloth. It is awesome."
5,LOVE THESE MUGS,"We own 4 of these mugs and I plan on buying more!!! they fit perfectly in cup holders, coffee stays warm, easy to drink out of....just perfect!!"
2,Skipsville,"Starting watching season 4 last night. The first show played normal. The next shows, on the entire disk, skipped. We were moving forward to a different scene so many times only to have that scene skip, and that was only disk 1. Considering very strongly in returning item. Need to try Season 5 first."
5,Great product!,Great product! Very good quality looks great and easy to install. We also purchased a matching towel bar of he same design and was equally impressed the the quality and look of the product.
3,"nice looking, doesn't hold heavy towels very well","I really like the looks of these hooks but my heavy towels tend to slip off the hook. Not all the time, but enough to make me think about getting some gummy paint to put on the ""ball"" to help grip. Only the heavy towels seem to be a problem. Love them, otherwise."
3,it's okay,"I saw a production of basically this cast at the Met (but with Levine conducting) and the singing is indeed TOP notch. If you do like Dawn Upshaw's voice (which I do), then by all means this is the recording of the Rake's to have. If you just want to hear Upshaw doing the ""No Word from Tom/I go to him"" cabaletta/aria then I would recommend her ""knoxville CD"" which has that combo w/ Zinman conducting. I would probably have a more favorable (higher starred) review of this particular recording if I had not purchased the new Gardiner one. If you are the 1st time customer wanting to listen to Neo-Classic Stravinsky at his best, then that is the one to go with: faster tempi, unbelievable diction, crisp strings, albeit no-Upshaw. Nagano gets a fantastic sound (as usual) but I would recommend the Gardiner."
4,Doesn't Quite Live Up To Their Hype Or High Cost,"These liners are quite good and fit well; however, they do not have nibs on their bottom side and have a tendency to slide around just a bit. Not bad, but non the less, they do slip around on the flat floor of a Toyota Tundra/Sequoia. I expect they'd slide around on any floor that was level to the door sill as opposed to they're being used in a sunken floor type application typical of a sports sedan. Then there's the skimpy warranty and the high cost of this product, say, in comparison to their direct competitor product offered by Husky Liners. I just don't think the Weatherbeater product lives up to its hype and high cost."
1,Living Legend - not on this DVD!,"If I asked my 11 year old grandson to shoot some video of a musical performance he would probably have made a better job than the rank amateurish nature of this DVD. My first thought was that this was shot on an iPhone (version 3 rather than the 4!).The sound quality is quite good, almost ""excellent"", but the ""Living Legend"" moves at a tad arthritic pace, and looks as if he's had a few too many six packs of Red Stripe.As an avid Reggae fan, I was very disappointed - the only valid reason for buying this DVD is for completing a collection of ALL reggae, good and BAD."
5,Read this series no more then 5 times,"I grew up with these books. I read them as a young one, through high school, college, and I just read them again at the age of 32. This trilogy and the one that followed are legendary in my opinion. It does follow a similar plot to LOTR however I connected with these books and its character a lot more then the rambling LOTR. To this day, in D&D realms, people still name their character ""Raislin"", ""Tanis"" and ""Sturm"". These books are LEGENDS to the D&D community. The connection you will gain from the characters of these books will stay with you for years. It is always a pleasure to return to Solstice! Don't let Tasslehoff get close to your bags, your purse may have accidentally appeared in his bags... after you dropped it of course, he was just holding it for you and forgot to tell you. I have a best friend (40 years old) who named his daughter Raistlin after these books.. they are that good."
5,Very enjoyable,"I read these books when I was about 15. Before this time I really didn't enjoy reading anything, since that time I have been a lover of fiction. I really liked the detail, of the story and characters- my personal favorites Kitara, Raistlin, and Laurana( but only in the last book)"
5,"The most GENIUS, AMAZING book I've ever read.","And I've read a lot. I just finished to read the Dragonlance Chronicles for the sixth time, and it still overwhelms me. I still wiped my tears off when one of the characters died, I was still mesmerized as I followed the scenes that lead to one surprise after another. Dragonlance Chronicles is a must-read for every fantasy lover (although I'm quite sure all of you guys have already been in that adventure). Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman are genius, and they have changed my life with their books. EXCELLENT!!"
5,Perfect gift,"Purchased as a gift. Arrived in perfect condition. He loved the set. What more could I have asked for? Oh, the price was great too!"
5,Oh my god,"I found myself actually crying when Sturm and Flint died. I found myself shaking when Tas was poisoned and when Tanis was thinking of killing Lord Ariakas. Absolutely the MOST immersive books I have ever read. I read the whole trilogy in just over 2 days, that's including having to goto class and sleep every once in a while too. There's no reason you should not read these books. You find the characters becoming your best friends and you're heartbroken when you have to close the third book."
3,Dragonlance,"This series is very similar to Lord of the Rings, however it has many things that are not found in Lord of the Rings. The descriptions of places and people are detailed in the effect of what we would notice in real life. There are some good and unique points in the story line but the characterizing is too similar to Lord of the Rings to suite my taste. But if you have read Lord of the Rings, you will see some similarities that may make this series not quite as interesting as others that are more unique. But I think this series is worth the read."
5,I have yet too read a better series,"If you like fantasy and haven't read this series, you must not like fantasy. I have reread the series probally 10 times and each time i enjoy it like the first."
5,"A world of dragons, dazzling magic, and unique Characters","Follow the companions from the Inn of the Last Home on an adventure to thelost city of Xak Tsaroth to retrieve the discs of Mishakal. Thrill when theheroes face all kinds of danger, from draconians to a black dragon. Experiencethe wonders of magic as a world of unicorns, elves, and powerful magics openfor your eyes. Probably the best books in the Dragonlance series."
5,Much better than Lord of the rings,This trilogy reminds me of Lord of the Rings. Except this trilogy is ten times better.
5,Escape the cares of the world...,This book holds a special place with me. It was one of the first books that I read where I wasn't being forced to do a book report. The best thing about this series is that it tells a great story. This is something that I like to go back and read every few years to bring the memories back the memories of what it was like to be a kid when your imagination could run wild. This is always the #1 fantasy series that I recommend to people who are interested in the genre. Long live Krynn...
5,Guilty Pleasures...!,"It's a bit of a guilty pleasure for a thirty odd woman to read these books, instead of reading more ""serious"" literature, but these were the very first fantasy books I ever read, when I was in the fifth grade in school..I hadn't read them in ages (the first set I bought are in my home country), so I got a new set, to have a re-read...I enjoyed them very much, and I am now waiting for the last of the companion /lost books, to complete the story from that time..Love these books (even with the occasional event / times discrepancy)...!"
5,Great Book!,"Excellent trilogy for any fantasy reader! A must read that will lead you into an amazing word, with lots and lots of options as to what to read next!"
1,utter crap,"personally i wouldn't even give this tripe one star - but that was the lowest rating allowed. no depth to the characters, in fact the whole series was eerily reminiscent of a game of D&D. The only saving grace was that the authors didn't tell us exactly what numbers came up on the dice as they were writing this book...your money is better spent on Tolkien, or Feist, or even Pratchett....."
1,Skip it.,"I read the Legends trilogy (that follows this one) and loved it. THEN, I began reading Chronicles and despite being highly interested in learning more about the characters from Legends, I couldn't finish the trilogy. It was soooo boring. So, maybe if you like Tolkien, you'll like this (sorry, not a fan of longwinded tales, I guess).If you want a good trilogy, skip to Legends. Better yet, read Ursula K LeGuin's Earthsea trilogy."
1,MISSING PAGES ON BOOK 1!?!?!?!?!?!?!,"Was very happy to finally have gotten a copy of the trilogy, but was very disappointed after reading page 28 of book 1, it immediately jumped to PAGE 61 ?!?!?!?!?"
5,Starting to read fantasy? This is It!!!,"This trilogy is the starting point of Dragonlance. Ansalon, a continent ravaged by years of desollation and petty wars finally has a chance a winning back the favor of the gods.These novels tell the tale of a Party of friends, that destiny brings together, so that they can once again discover the true gods of the long lost past.This trilogy sets the atmosphere for some of the most thought capturing books ever. Buy them and read them, I promise you won't be dissappointed."
4,Great fantasy trilogy,"After reading these three fantasy novels, I tried to read the other Dragonlance books. Ugh! Stick to these three, however and you can't go wrong. At least as good as other epic fantasy trilogies: Tolkien, Eddings, etc."
5,INCREDIBLE!!!!,"These books, once you have read them, will be remembered forever. At moments through the stories you will find yourself laughing and crying and celebrating along with the characters that the stories are about. The most exiting and enticing books in the fantasy world. This amazing sereies is a must read for all people not just fantasy lovers."
5,The most amazing books I have ever read.,"I don't know how anyone cannot like these books. I have read all three of them, plus the legends trilogy, which I own, and am blown away at the stunning story line. If you love books about magic and dragons and fighting and....well you get the picture. For those who would like to see the artwork, they have just reprinted the ""Art of the Dragonlance saga"" so hurry to your bookstore and get it today!"
5,This is some good stuff!!!,Geez you just gotta love these books. You can't just help laughing at all the jokes. I have read them over and over again and always seen something I have missed before. This series is right up there with Jordan and Brooks and Tolkein. Highly Recomended!!
2,Dissapointing,"I'm not going to say this series was all bad, but its nothing compared to Jordan or Terry Brooks. Or even David Eddings. The storyline was nothing new, though Raistlin, Kitiara and Verminaard were good editions to the plot and my favorate characters besides. For all you sturm fans out there, i'd just like to say sturm was pathetic! he deserved to die! haha Verminaard should have killed them all in the end of the first book!"
4,An excellent FPS!,"I've alwasy been interested in WWII. I always watch those boring History Channel shows but for once I'm calling the shots. Medal of Honor: Frontline's strong point is its single-player action, however its multiplayer lacks interest. For those of you that are bond players this is going to be a hard game to start out with. First of all there is no auto-aim, so you do it manually, which kind of sucks but they counter that with the fact that the enemy doesn't squirm around very much. The story line is pretty good but i beat the game in about a week. So expect going back to your favorite level and playing it again. Graphics are exceptionally good and the authanticity is also. This game's weak when it comes to multiplayer, at least my friends didn't like it. There aren't many guns and the contols are hard unless you use them for 3 hours just to get used to them. I'd suggest renting this game but NOT buying. It's way too short"
5,Best WWII game I have ever played,This game is one of the best games I have ever played. It includes strategy with action. The more you play the more you get addicted. Medal Of Honor is a little bit harder than the other shooting games because you do not have auto aim but believe me you'll get used to it. The multiplayer is so-so because it does not have any other games like capture the flag. You can only do teams and free for all. If you are planning to get a game get this one.
2,...um...yeah...,"I highly suggest that you do not buy this game. The first level is far out cool, but the rest of the entire game is you, a lonesome soldier against hundreds of Germans. The weapons are not cool, the game is too easy, and the storyline does not follow World War 2 at all. The graphics, are...eeh... okay, but could be much better. I had this game for about a week, and already I got bored. Plus, I beat the game in three days, flat, so that kinda tells you that it's a [bad] game. And the controls! JEEZ LAWEEZE!... They're impossible!The aiming system is terrible, and the guns are completely inacurate.Don't buy this game."
4,Great Game,This is an excellent game and great graphics for a gamecube game!! Bottom line get this game
3,regular game,"when i buy it i was this was a war game or you whith 6 patners.all the time.no the 95%is you alone vs.100 enemies and is houses,palace,no good graphics.the best part is the first the third,and the first part mission 3.and the last part of the game."
2,Medal of Honor Frontline,"Poor graphics for an EA game, and the controls and movement through the game are choppy and poor. I wish I never bought this game."
2,flawed,Terrible controls. Push yellow button forward to look up and back toward you to look down??? Opposite of flight sims. I tried for hours to get used to that. You are always in solo roles and german soldiers are dumber than dumb. Aiming is difficult.
2,MOH: Frontline,"While this is a good game it dosen't compare to the PC one, MOHAA. Go buy MOHAA and don't waste your money on this one."
5,Frontline is the one,"What I thought of Medal of Honor:Frontline, the graphics, sound, and story idea are very good. It shows a new addition to the game cube and will keep you busy, I'm still playing it right now."
4,"Good, to rent","I rented this game to see if I might want to buy it. I beat in two days, although it was slightly challenging. Theres not much replayability in the game, especially since the multiplayer sucks. So I advise you to rent it, not buy it."
3,An Ok Game,"This game is average. i played this game for a while and became very annoyed. The game and weapons are very realalistic. if u are looking for a good multiplayer game, keep looking. The graphics are ok, nothing to great. The aiming is just annoying, sure its fun to shoot these nazis who have no idea that ur coming, but if u can hit them that takes all the fun away. most of the time i have to stand there and aim while 15 men are shooting at me. If ur looking for a good game that you can go around shooting people in this isnt the game, and as for good multiplayer, i recomend one of the james bond games, u just dont get tierd of shooting ur friends in that game. if ur crazy about WW2 then get this game."
5,TRUE ORIGINALITY,"RANDY WESTON WAS ONE OF THE FIRST AMERICAN JAZZ MUSICIANS TO EXPLORE ""WORLD MUSIC"", AND THIS CD IS JUST ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THAT EXPLORATION. HIS FOCUS HAS MAINLY BEEN ON AFRICAN MUSIC, AND HE IS ONE OF AMERICA'S MOST WELL KNOWN JAZZ MUSICIANS WHO IS A PROPONENT OF IT. THIS CD FEATURES THE GREAT PHAROAH SANDERS ON SAXOPHONE AND SOME EXTREMELY AVANT GARDE MUSIC (A LA JOHN COLTRANE, AND SOME MONK-LIKE PIANO SOUNDS) MIXED IN WITH AFRICAN RHYTHMS AND FLAVORS. IF YOU WANT TO SIT DOWN AND ""LISTEN"" TO A CD, YOU WILL ENJOY THIS ONE."
2,Taking Liberties?,"I found this book qhwn I was searching for information on hexsigns and the pow wow practices of the Pennsylvania Dutch. I bought it used, and good thing too! As I began to read, I found the author had really gone beyone taking liberties with tried and true practice. SilverReven Wolf seems to have decided that powwow is interchangeable with her ""new age"" religion. Pow Wow is based largely in Protestant Christianity and Ravenwolf seems to want to remove that aspect from it. What bothered me the most was the chapter on The Holy Psalms. The author actualy took Psalms and reworded them, taking away God and adding names of pagan goddesses...sorry but this is pure fantasy! The Psalms have been used for thousands of years and don't warrant changing. I am very open to many paths, but I know the difference between them, this author apparently does not!"
2,well its ...okaaaay. I guess,"This book os not bad, exactly.Well, OK it IS bad-but could be of some use. As one of the other reviewrs has mentioned the professed history is truly worthy of ridicule and the neo-pagan changes to traditional christian chants is offensive (this is a neo-pagan talking!).That being said there is some interesting material for the beginer with some idea of hex work/pow-wow. I would HIGHLY recomend Karl Herr's ""hex and spellwork"". Once you've read this I think you'll know which aspects of ""hexcraft"" are worthwhile and which are not"
4,good book for those who are interested in HexCraft,"For people who are interested in reading about the Dutch Country Magick, this isnt' a bad book. Ravenwolf packs it with quite a bit of information,and shows many of the charms used by the Pow Wow Artists. It also shows her struggle in trying to write the book, as well as other things. Definitly a decent read if interested in Pow Wow, or desitring ot read more of Ravenwolf's books."
3,HexCraft offers much,"Once again Silver RavenWolf has taken us to new places, much to be learned here. I particularly like the HeadAche and Ward off Dogs charms. These work well. Much more to be learned here. Only gave three stars because its not a type off magick many would practice."
5,HexCraft,This book is everything I'd hoped for. Lady RavenWolf has a writing style that I love.HexCraft: Dutch Country Magick (Llewellyn's Practical Magick Series)
2,A lucrative business.,Little mythical books are very lucrative at this time. Keep writing this stuff and you'll have a nice income from your fun imagination. I just hope the readers don't really take it too seriously and realize it's content for entertainment.
4,"Relax, One Hnaded Molly is the New and Upcomming Band","The new Cd TRUTH from One Handed Molly is great. This cd conatins a varitey of music. I reccommend this Cd for a day in which you have just come back from work after having to deal with the world on your shoulders. One Handed Molly's unique blend of music will make all your troubles go away. On top of the great music, there are the great people that make the music. If you are ever looing for something to do and you are in New York, go and check them out. One Handed Molly is sure to be the new household name in just a short period of time."
5,Excellent compilation,"Growing up in Saint Louis and having recently moved back, this has made me appreciate my city for what it once was and what it may become. This book is well put together and the research is obviously impeccable. It has no social agenda or views as many historical books do, but it just shows exactly what it says, ""then and now"". It was very enjoyable. The best gift I can give fellow St. Louisan's for any occasion."
4,Another Addictive DW title,This game is great because you get to see enemies fly at the press of a few buttons. I have never played 1 or 2 and i'm glad i would probably say something like not another Dynasty Warrior game. But because i have only played this one it is really good for me:Pros:*Over 40 characters*Extremly Addictive*2 player coop*See enemies fly with the touch of a few buttons*Change bodyguards to officers*Cool items and new weaponsCons:*Repetitive*Poor 2 player vs modeJust something to finish off if u buy this game and want to complete it. It will take you a long time. I have finished the whole game with every character and still not got all weapons and items.
5,da best game ever,dis game is da best ever. i played it on playstation 2 n it was da best. now since its comin out 4 xbox its gonna hab better graphics n it still has elephants which makes it really kool.
1,Walk AWAY from this item,This is the worst item I've ever purchased online. It does not come with stands. Now I need to search stand for this damn net. Picture shows stand also.
3,why try so hard?,"It amazes me no end how hard the cultists of cultism try to bad-mouth the est Training & Werner Erhard and the new Landmark Education Forum, as in a few reviews below. I did the est Training in 1978 and have been using the technology of transformation in my life every day since, something the cultists cannot fathom. And that is so even when I'm not able to participate in Landmark courses, such as the multi-week seminars. I saw a redneck bigot give up his bigotry in a weekend during the CAP Course, and that was not even a covered topic -- the man moved from racial slurs to asking to hug the 250-pound black man that he had offended the day before.I honor Werner Erhard and the est/Landmark technology because it happens to work quite well when applied to one's life. Didn't work for a reviewer below? Maybe because he needs a reason for his life not working... My life might be full of tribulation, but applying the Landmark technology turns things around every time."
2,Not recommended,"I've never been a fan of Kiri Te Kanawa's, but recently her voice has worsened. A few of these arias are performed decently enough, but Te Kanawa's wobbly vibrato and frog-like tone destroy the rest of them."
1,Oprah?,The very idea of Discovery using the Queen of TrashTV is sickening at best. Like everyone else I will pre-order the BBC version. Discovery Channel had a good product but someone bean brain was more concerned about celebrity over quality.
2,great but Opera?,"The cinematography and soundtrack are as spectacular as the Planet Earth and Blue Planet series. Which is why I gave it two stars instead of one, but with Opera narrating I can't help but feel like I'm sitting in a first grade class being read a story. It's just not the same without David Attenborough."
1,David Attenborough,"Oprah? LAME! David Attenborough is an amazing narrator with passion for nature. Oprah is to Life what Sigourney Weaver was to Planet Earth. Sigourney Weaver and Oprah are in no way comparable to Attenborough. If I can't buy the DVD with Attenborough then I won't buy it at all. Period.Just because I am an American doesn't mean that I can't understand Attenborough. Why do you insist on ruining another landmark series? English is English, no matter what accent it is spoken in."
1,Oprah should not narrate Natural History,"It is sad when someone as talented as Oprah is misguided enough to think she is a wildlife documentary narrator. Her phrasing, timing, and emphasis all miss the mark, and she detracts from the the drama unfolding on the screen. Strange that Discovery must have paid a phenomenal amount of money when Attenborough had already done the job well."
1,Don't you dare give money to the Oprah version!,"Buy the real version, with Sir David Attenborough. He is engaging and does not act like it is a pre-school class. Besides that, the insult is much worse because he completed his narration and everything was fine, so they had to essentially delete his already-existing narration to replace it with the Americanized obnoxiousness of Oprah.The Attenborough version:Life [Blu-ray]Anyway, this series has footage that is superior to basically all previous documentaries. The film quality is simply awesome. Having said that, this is not as valuable or informative as many other series, such as Attenborough's amazing series of programs that he wrote (Life On Earth, Trials of Life, Life of... etc) which are far more insightful into really understanding things."
2,"OMG, I'm in Oprah Hell!",I'm listening to Oprah's voice right now on the Science Channel as she narrates the first two episodes. How utterly annoying. I just put the UK version with David Attenborough in my Amazon shopping cart. What could they possibly be thinking? Oprah?! Give me a break!
1,Ghastly,"I don't know why the Discovery Channel insist on buying BBC programmes then -- after massively dumbing down the script -- getting someone who hasn't the first clue on the subject to narrate. They made the same mistake with Planet Earth and replacing Attenborough with Sigourney Weaver.Attenborough has been doing nature shows for the BBC since the 1950s and has had a passion for natural sciences since he was a child. Oprah is a talk show host.Don't buy this knock-off, get the Attenborough version and get narration from someone who's been in the business since the start."
1,Oprah has no place here,"She takes away from the experience, Attenborough is a perfect man for the job...why they hired Operah for America I will never know. Hearing her voice on a documentary makes it feel very tawdry, and like it was done to obtain a mass market appeal from America. No good, get the other version."
4,Ok,This is a good movie to watch when entertaining guests everyone is in aww with the closeness to the animals and insects and the picture quality is unbelievable. My young children even enjoy watching it and they do not watch anything except cartoons. These are great movies that show you just how big the world is and that there are creatures out there that we didnt know existed.
1,Inferior - Not Only Because of Oprah,"The series in itself is great. BUT, this is the inferior version.Frankly, I don't care about Oprah - neither hate nor love her.Personally, I prefer Attenborough so I will reduce a star for that.MORE importantly, all the episodes are 720p NOT 1980p; whereas the Attenborough version has all but one in 1080p (full hd).Admittedly, it has a better menu BUT it is an inferior product (not only because of my choice of narrator - and I have watched both versions completely) but because you pay the same price for inferior resolution."
1,Go with the Original,The only reason you should go with the Oprah version is if you get it free at her show sell it and then buy original David Attenborough version.
1,They charge MORE for the dopy Opy version?,Don't even THINK about buying this version!Sir David Attenborough RULES when it comes to narrating the Natural World!To allow this rich b@$ch to abuse this great series with her atrocious over dubbing is a disgrace and an abomination!
2,Winfrey sucks!!,This series has some of the most spectacular photography one can imagine. The problem is the narration. Who ever told this fat egocentric tub of lard that she could narrate should be sent to Siberia. She totally RUINS the production. It is my understanding that she funded some of this. I guess if you have enough money to throw around you can do just about anything!!
5,Amazing!,"I love nature so much and this CD is just a beautiful addition to my collection. I recommend the version narrated by David instead of the Oprah one. Get it, show it to your children (if you have any) It is important for them to start appreciating nature early on."
5,Life (narrated by David Attenborough) [Blu-ray],This is a must for anyone who loves life in general and animals in particular.
1,Wait for Attenborough!,"It's not that Oprah narrates - it's the nonsense she is reading. The script has been entirely re-written for US consumption, and dumbed down to condescending jibberish in the process."
1,Boooooooo - Get the David Attenborough version!,Seriously - Why do they feel the need to dumb down these series for American viewers? Do yourself a favor and get the version that is narrated properly by Sir David Attenborough!
1,Boycott the Oprah version. Oprah's Narration is terrible!,"Don't buy this version! It has the obnoxious voice of Oprah narrating. Her voice is too deep for a woman and she sounds like a man. Oprah, just stick to daytime talk shows, please don't torture us with your bad voice work ever again! Leave the voice work to the experts please. How did you even get hired to ruin this great program anyways? I guess you have connections. You might as well start another career since you are so popular Oprah. Maybe your connections can get you playing tennis like Venus and Serena because you will get about the same results as your voice work.....EPIC FAIL! Please go away Oprah. ONLY BUY THE REAL VERSION as narrated by the naturalist David Attenborough!"
1,Criminal Stupidity,"My fellow Americans, please do not buy this edition and instead buy the one with Sir David's narration. Let's show the world that this atrocity is NOT approved by us. I gave one star but there is no rating system to show how a work of excellence in science and art for ages, could be turned into a boring bed time story when the narrator has NOOOOO idea what she is talking about, UNBELIEVABLE!!!!"
1,Wait for the BBC version,"It's a shame that the producers chose Oprah. Her narraration of this series makes it seem like she is talking down to you. I enjoyed Sigourney Weaver in Planet Earth, but Oprah makes this unwatchable. I stopped DVR'ing these and decided to wait for the BBC version with David Attenborough because he is the master of narration.Save your money, the version with Oprah gives these DVD's NO replay value."
1,"Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice shame on me.","When I first got my HD TV and BluRay player, I put ""Planet Earth"" on my Christmas gift request list. Little did I know that the gift I would received from a family member was the Sigourney Weaver narrated version. I was too embarrassed to say anything, but went out and bought the David Attenborough narrated version on my own.I won't make the same mistake twice. Steer clear of the Oprah version and order the David Attenborough narrated version. Hopefully Discovery will get the message and stop this nonsense.Life (narrated by David Attenborough) [Blu-ray]"
1,Wasted effort with Oprah,This is a waste of everyone's time including Oprah's. Why would you even try this ?
2,"Some people just don't get it, but I guess that's LIFE","Oprah might be better than Sigourney Weaver, but why can't they just leave the guru of nature documentaries to the job. Why does this have to be one of those things where it is just here in the U.S. that we can't let something be good and leave it at that? Oprah is good at making my mom cry doing shows that are the TV equivalent of People magazine updates (well, mostly), and balancing out with useful outreach fundraisers, etc. BBC does it right. Discovery Channel tries too hard yet again"
1,American version is garbage,"I saw the Oprah version on Discovery and thought that it was a terrible follow-up to Planet Earth. Then, when I realized there was a David Attenborough version, I bought it and it is incredible. America needs to stop dumbing things down for its citizens."
1,make sure you get version narrated by david!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I was so excited when this came out and was very dissappointed when i arrived at the store and the only had oprahs version. I ended up buying it out of excitement for life but after about twenty minutes realized i got the short end of the stick, oprah is lacking in factual information as well is a real bore. I actually bought the other version with david on amazon SO MUCH BETTER and oprahs version is collecting dust."
1,"Oprah ruined this, and is colluding with Netflix to keep out the true version.",Just terrible. I waited for two years to watch this and when it was finally broadcast I couldn't even finish it. Oprah's narration represents everything wrong with America's image overseas. It is embarrassing.
1,do not buy,"Do not buy this version. If you want to watch the series, buy the David Attenborough narrated version from the BBC. David Attenborough has a 40yr long career writing, producing, presenting and narrating this type of documentary. He is a world-renowned expert in the field. I thought that Discovery would have realized their mistake when they used Sigourney Weaver for Planet Earth. Oprah's narration is 10 times worse, her narration makes what would be an amazing series nearly unwatchable."
1,Oprah makes me cringe,There are many times when I am watching the Oprah version when I am cringing and wishing she had not had the bright idea to branch out from talk show hostess to nature documentary narration. She is not David Attenborough nor Alan Alda. I hope to see the original BBC series soon.
5,"Life, Life, Life",This Life series rates as one of the best of natures documentaries and I suggest this to any nature lover especially the David Attenbourough version
1,Did not play on my PS3,"For some reason the blu ray did not play in my PS3. Maybe it is not truly region free. But, the Life series itself is truly 5 stars"
5,"Awesome, But,","Although the fact that this dvd set is an awesome learning tool for toddlers, teens & adults, & I highly recommend it to ALL, my grandaughter prefers the voice/narration of ""the girl"". See, when my grandaughter first viewed LIFE in the United States it was with the a voice she has come to recognize & enjoy as soothing. Hence, my purchasing of a second LIFE dvd package with the voice of Oprah Winfrey as the narrator. My grandaughter is 4 & will be giving this as a gift to her cousin age 3 who loves the giant animals stomping in it & yes, I am an Oprah fan :)"
5,Give Oprah a break - She does fine,"Oprah does fine narrating this excellent documentary. I can finally understand clearly, as she speaks louder than the music (this is not the case with the British guy - his voice is too soft and is overpowered by the music for much of the documentary) Don't get me wrong, the British guy is ok, but Oprah, in my opinion, does a better job. The documentary itself, is outstanding. It's just a matter of who you want to listen to, the British, soft spoken guy, or Oprah. I choose Oprah, hands down...sorry Brits!"
1,Sony BD Player? Out of luck!,"After receiving this and trying to play it in my Sony BD player, BDP-BX1, it would not get past the opening splash screen. Tried it on the other BD player, same model, same thing.Come to find out, this is a 50hz disc instead of the normal 60 and does not work on Sony BD players. Email back from 2E/BBC, their suggestion was to buy a new BD player.Gee, thanks!"
4,My kids love it,"Reading the reviews of ""Life"", I'm amazed that they are so negative! We bought this for our autistic son for his birthday and he loves this show. I have 3 kids and they all love it and watch it over and over. I enjoyed the show myself. Yes, Oprah does narrate it as if she were speaking to children, but that didn't bother me. We enjoyed the animals and the interesting facts. My kids especially love the Venus Fly Trap in the plants episode. They love the mud fish and there is a fish that climbs up a waterfall. The images are beautiful and I think it is worth the money, especially if you want something exciting and educational for your children. We haven't regretted this purchase and if i didn't already own it, i would certainly buy it again."
1,Doesn't work with all Bluray players,"So 2|Entertain was lazy and just imports the European version of this Bluray to America. That means.. it runs on 50Hz, not 60. Any some players... most notably.. the PS3, can not support this. So now, I have Life, and I can't even watch it. Please check your player compatibility before paying."
1,Panasonic Player Doesn't Work Either,"Same issues stated about Sony players.. just got it yesterday, fired up, through the BBC brand intro, then nothing. FYI - Panasonic BDT110"
4,"great series, weird blu ray packaging.","The video looks great with good commentary, would have gotten 5 stars if not for the big and bulky packaging it came in along where you had to pull out disc one to get to disc 2. Planet earth packaging was way nicer. Also would have been nice if you could choose each different episode in from the menu instead of each disc being a 3 hour block. These things might not even bother most people."
1,Discovery's strangelove or: How I learned to stop worrying and love Amazon.co.uk,"I'm gonna be honest here. While Life has amazing cinematography and editing, I can't help but to be annoyed by Oprah's condescending voice. Luckily, I predicted that it was going to be a terrible rendition, and went out of my way to legally attain a copy of the BBC edition.So while the BBC edition isn't availble on Amazon.com until June 1'st, it's available now (even used) on Amazon.co.uk.I recommend this route to anyone that wants to enjoy the show how it's meant to be enjoyed without having to wait till the summer to do so."
1,I regret buying the US version,"Oprah? Really? This is an insult! The only redemption for this version is to choose audio 2 -no narration.I was so excited when I first inserted the first Blu-Ray disc. The majesty of nature in full High-Definition in my living room. It was magnificent in it's full 1080p glory, until the narration commenced. It sounded like Oprah so I looked at the case and indeed it was her. I said to myself maybe she'll be good at it since she did have a very successful talk show where all she did was talk. Oh no, oh no, oh no, no, no, no, no. She should have kept her day job. It's ruined. I wouldn't dare donate it to Goodwill and make someone experience the same deceptive expectation.I hate it so much that I made this emphatic and overly dramatic review for the very first time, in hopes to nudge would-be expecting consumers.I just have to suffer the consequences of my poor deceived decision. Cue in the violins."
1,BBC Had It Right. Oprah's narration is Annoying,"I'm in the USA and just ordered the BBC VERSION of this series. I tried to watch the US version on the Green Planet cable channel but Oprah's narration is horrid. Boring, slow unfeeling readings. I very much prefer the excitement and joy of David A's voice as he shares his passion with us. Like the other reviewers have said, enjoy the BBC version!"
1,"Buy the ORIGINAL, forget the Oprah remake.","I'm not going to get heated and aggressive about this. I'm just going to tell it like it is. David Attenborough has been making and narrating natural history videos since the 1950s. The BBC has the best track record of any natural history unit on the planet. Most of the ""groundbreaking"" specials on Discovery of National Geographic you see are re-makes of BBC originals. The same is true of ""Life"". And there is no reason for this. The originals far surpass any remakes. Find out for yourself. Skip out on this version, cause you already saw it on the Discovery Channel already. Buy the original Attenborough version."
2,Beautiful with Terrible Narration,"The two stars are for the incredibly beautiful and mesmerizing cinematography, but don't buy this verion. The narration by Oprah is atrocious and extremely irritating. In all fairness to her she probably had little to do with the script and she was certainly directed as to how to read it. A few have suggested that the negative criticism of her narration is some kind of Oprah bashing. If you have seen this version you know that is simply not the case. No one can argue that Oprah is not a great TV personality and one of our finest movie actresses. And she does have a very pleasant voice. However, she simply stinks as a narrator of this production. Wait and get the Blu Ray David Attenborough version and then you won't be sorry."
1,Buy the other one.,I don't know why they keep replacing the English guy with lame American voices. They sound completely bored with no enthusiasm.Skip this version and get the 5/5 Attenborough one.
1,Another dumb down for American viewers,I guess we don't speak English here. And we're apparently so ethnocentric we need Amerikan spoke or we won't buy. Sign of the times or what? We can't even relate to our same language cousins. Mr Attenborough and the BBC do these the best and Discovery hasn't a clue. Look at the awful Discovery Channel. Way more commercials than nature. They in it for the bucks. Mr A and the Beeb do it for love and love of quality. Get the BBC version.
1,Order the BBC version with David Attenborough,"All I have to say is when I turned on the discovery channel to find Oprah doing the narration for Life, I tried to watch it then shut it off and cancelled the dvr scheduling. Please people order the BBC version with David Attenborough, he is quite possibly the greatest narrator to ever live. He also has a deep understand of what he is narrating."
1,no oprah no!,"I'm from chicago, I love oprah, she's an amazing woman. That being said, her narration ruined this series for me. Get the version with David Attenborough instead. If possible, hire Morgan Freeman to read the narration to you instead while you watch."
4,"Oprah is Great! But no ""British Translation"" knocks it down a star!","I normally hate anything with Oprah and I love all those documentaries narrated by David Attenborough. But I think O does a great job (unlike Sigourney Weaver). I also like the Attenborough narrations. I would love to have both with out spending twice the money. So, the real complaints in all these 'reviews' should by why the discs don't include both audio tracks. Bluray discs have a huge amount of space and it seems to me that an extra track could be included."
2,5 stars for LIFE... 0 for DA,"I am showing this Blue Ray version to my Biology high school students, whose faces of awe are worth watching. The filming is just above any expectations, and in blueray just awesome. But I hesitate to understand why replacing Oprah Winfrey with Sir D.Attenborough. Sir A's voice is way past his prime, sometimes difficult to understand, and an irritating to the ear (it was so in previous installments of these magnificent BBC productions). Ms. Winfrey, on the other hand, communicates so well the marvels, with clarity and gusto. I am definitely not supporting this over Winfrey's original. And I would prefer any other voice used (e.g., Sigourney Weaver) than DA's."
5,Oprah is GREAT!,"Oprah is fantastic in this. What some find annoying, I find enchanting and funny. For all you too serious people out there, get a life, or lighten up! I like the fact that this appeals to the younger folks! It helps draw them in and keep them there. No kid wants to sit there and listen to some dude with a horrible accent drone ON and ON with no sense of humor or appreciation for the things that our youth find interesting and playful. Its hard enough to pull them away from the death and violence video games...I say way to GO girl! You keep on narrating! The rest can go listen to the boring, stuck up version... *yawn*."
2,Like a Frog Missing its Landing - Life Falls Short,"I LOVE discovery and BBC documentaries. I've grown up on these things and have watched them evolve from hours upon hours of sharks and crocodiles to the cinematics and photographic technology of Life and Planet Earth. I was truly looking forward to Life; as I thought Planet Earth was one of the greatest, informative and intriguing series I had seen. Life, however, completely fell short. They champion following over 200 species through life and death and survival; from my personal perspective, I thought it completely GLAZED over informative opportunities and that the disconnect in transitions didn't deepen my engagement but allowed me to wander off in thought and activity. I really was disappointed as I truly am an advocate and champion of the BBC and Discovery. I recommend you rent before you buy. Also, if you watch the highlights on the Life website...you've pretty much killed all the 'big' moments."
1,If you buy this you are THAT guy.,"You. Yes, You. You are that dumb American they make fun of us for being :(."
2,disappointed,It felt like some of the footage was from Blue Planet/Planet Earth so I was a little disappointed. It is still great to see but I still prefer the Planet Earth collection.
4,Great Wildlife Movies,We recently received our Life video set. The cinematography is great. We truly live on an incredible plant designed by a powerful Creator. Although I don't enjoy Oprah's voice-over as much as David Attenborough (spelling?) the scenes are wonderful and there is a lot of movie for the money. Would recommend it to a friend.
1,Advertisement for Evolution,"First off, Oprah was a horrible choice for a narrator, very cheesy and I just don't like hearing her voice during the whole documentary. Also the narration is an advertisement for evolution. Every two minutes it's talking about how these animals evolved over a gazillion years ago. I don't want to hear someone's opinion about the theory of evolution throughout the documentary."
5,Nothing Better!,"There is no better way to end a science unit then viewing the ""life"" episode that coincides with what my students are learning! It just brings everything to, well, life!"
3,don't buy the us version!,"This is the first time I write a review on amazon, but I just had to say something about the Us version of LIFE, the blue ray is amazing but Oprah narrating is awful, just get the UK version"
1,Oprah Sucks,Oprah ruins everything. I sure hope someone checks out these reviews so this horrible mistake will never happen again.
1,Waste of time with Oprah,"Why did the studio do this with Oprah, i'll never understand. Planet Earth was done by one narrator and it was amazing. Now this show comes out, and all of a sudden they get 2 different narrators. Oprah is not horrible, but she is not suited for this type of work - don't ruin it for yourself, watch the British narrator, it's a pleasure to listen to him, you actually want to keep watching and learning all of the educational facts he provides you with. Wish Oprah, I just felt like turning my tv off and going out and getting the other version. I think they only did this to sell more since Oprah will talk about this on her show and there will be a bigger exposure to the American viewers."
1,nope,"No good. I must admit, every time I watch a nature video and David Attenbourgh is not narrating, I am disappointed. Oprah is not even slightly a good replacement, however. She sounds like she is trying to entertain a roomful of kids. The score is very distracting from the beautiful imagery. Instead of the organic instruments they have used in the past, it now sounds like a mutated version of Toy Story. The whole thing would be totally awesome if I were seven again, but I need more. The info is lacking, the narrating is unbelievable and uninspired, the sound effects are obnoxious...a true disappointment, but not nearly as disappointing as it is for all the photographers who slaved and provided stunning visuals, the only reason this got any stars at all. It might be beautiful on mute, but the audio ruins it all."
4,Life - narration by Richard Attenborough,"Like Planet Earth, the photography is spectacular. But for my taste, there was too much emphasis on insects. I would not have purchased it if David Attenborough had not narrated - not an Oprah fan. The series was enjoyable but I would not watch it again - that's how I judge them: would I watch a second time. I've already watched Planet Earth - all of it - three times."
2,Great video--bad audio,"I am such a huge fan of Blue Planet, Planet Earth, Blue Pacific and so many of the Discovery Channel's mini-series. However, Oprah's narration of Life is just awful. It is so dumbed down---I felt like my granny was talking to me--when I was 4. Its just too put on, too preschool teacher-esque. I loved the video and pictures--they are absolutely incredible, as would be expected, but I cannot figure out why the Discovery Channel would seek out a pop celeb to narrate this great show. Why change it from the original? I am so tired of Hollywood permeating every facet of media. Just b/c you're good at one thing does not make you stellar at it all. I'm buying the BBC version."
1,"5 stars for cinematography, 1/2 star for Oprah","I'm watching it now...Oprah narrating the deep sea episode. I didn't know she narrated a version of this amazing series and wondered what why David Attenborough wasn't speaking, whom I thoroughly enjoyed on the Planet Earth series. Even Sigourney Weaver did a fine job narrating that series. I understand Oprah does the U.S. version of Life. Too bad. I hate Oprah. I hate her talk show, I hate her voice, I hate her false politics and her arrogance. She's a phony. And that falseness actually comes through in her narration. She's reading without nuance, without interest, without knowledge, sleepy. She's a bore. I'm turning this off and getting the Attenborough version. Please do the same. While you're at it, stop reading the Oprah's Book list."
1,A Masterpiece Ruined,"I just don't get it. Why replace the marvelous narration by David Attenborough with Oprah's? Do the folks at the Discovery Channel think that Americans can't understand Attenborough's accent? Other than trying to cash in on Oprah's name, I can't think of a reason why they decided to ruin this incredible series. I'll pass on this version and stick to the original BBC release the same way I did with Planet Earth."
1,This is not the Life that you are looking for!,"I have no major problems with Oprah in general, but the observable fact is inescapable: She is terrible at this. I mean, wow. Just, wow. This is the worst narration for a nature documentary I've heard since that clown on the Extreme Animals show. Monotone and boring, it sounds like she's talking down to a three year old the whole time.This is an excellent, excellent show to purchase, but I highly recommend you get the original British version with David's professional and more engaging narration."
4,Wonderful images and insight into life's journey through time,"I couldn't think of a better title for these series. It provides not only amazing footage of all sorts of animal species but also about the interaction between all forms of Life. For me, ""insects"" as well as ""plants"" were among the best and most interesting ones."
1,Utter Rubbish! Or Should I just say IT SUCKS for the English Challenged?,"This version is a COMPLETE waste of time and an utter ripoff. What will Discovery think of next? Hiring ""Shoot Em From Choppers! ""Drill Baby Drill!"" Sarah Palin to do a documentary about the natural wonders of Alaska? UNBELIEVABLY POOR MARKETING!"
1,Oprah? You've got to be kidding me.,"Reviewers say they're embarrassed to be American, but really, the Brits should be more embarrassed by the BBC continuing to make the same mistake over-and-over again. You know what they say about madness? If the definition of madness is doing the same thing over-and-over again but expecting a different result, then the BBC are truly mad. Or Discovery--whomever is responsible for these atrocities."
5,Inspiring,"Purchased this video for my husband for Christmas, but the entire family has enjoyed it! It's educational and the cinematography is nothing short of genius. The entire series is filled with beautiful images and intriguing footage of scenes rarely seen. As an artist of acrylic"
1,Oprah- no,I hope both the Discovery channel and Oprah Winfrey take note of these reviews. You *ruined* this show Oprah Winfrey. You sound childish trite and dull. One of the worst editorial decisions in TV ever.
1,Very Boring Narration---I too will wait for the BBC release,"I agree with the majority of other reviewers! Discovery Channel.......PLEASE leave the BBC Nature Programs alone and stop trying to Hollywood-ize them. The filming and cinematography is awesome, however, Oprah's narration is so borng that both my husband and I fell asleep halfway through the second hour of the program. I will be ordering the BBC version in Blu-Ray and inviting several relatives over to watch with us as they too were very disappointed and stopped watching it. Hope someone from the Discovery Channel picks up on all these reviews and takes a hint to leave.....not just ""well enough"" alone, but ""brilliant"" programming alone!"
1,GET THE BBC VERSION!!!,"In total agreement with the reviewing majority here. Get the BBC version. These series are amazing, and are the domain of Sir David."
1,Just doing my part,"Hi everyone, just doing my part to explain that Oprah Winfrey's narration could not kiss the sandal straps of David Attenborough's narration.She over enunciates everything and speaks very matter-of-factedly. Furthermore, she patronizes the audience, as if they are a bunch of kids hearing a teacher read, ""See Spot Run.""I'm no Oprah hater, but I don't know how she got this part.Finally, I hear the footage on the David Attenborough version is more ""honest,"" regarding what actually happened to the cute, cuddly animal."
5,Very well done,"I have watched all parts of the Life series and was in awe with every one. I don't have a favorite or a least favorite, they were all fantastic. Producers of other programs should take note of the Life series to see how it should be done. The Life series is not for attention deficit people like most junk out there now. It slows the scenes down enough for the viewer to enjoy the beautiful photography and the fantastic high definition. It's not flashy, with 6 scenes per second like the recent American History ""Story of Us"" which is dizzying and awful. My hats off to the producers of Life, and to Attenborough, a real professional."
3,Had to return the first they sent!,"First time I ordered it, it came with a duplicate disc 4 and no disc 3 but when I exchanged for another it came with all discs present. A little bit of a hassle for me but it's a good show!"
1,DEMAND the original Attenborough BBC version!!!,As others have noted here...2 versions available and you want the Attenborough narration...not the Oprah version!!! Why? Simply because Attenborough is the expert in these topics and Oprah spent her career in a studio talk show in Chicago??? It's as bad as having Tom Cruise narrate Space Station...c'mon!!!
1,Stop ruining Attenborough's documentaries!,"Life is spectacular, beautiful, and amazing. And it's utterly ruined yet again by having some horrible American lady who has no idea what she's talking about doing the narration. Attenborough is a living legend and an amazing man - why on earth do they think that we Americans don't want to hear him?"
1,"Skip this version, get the BBC Life DVDs for proper narration",Oprah's narration is lackluster and distracting. David Attenborough's version conveys much better the drama unfolding before you. You can compare these two clips to confirm:Oprah: [...]David Attenborough: [...]
1,"Video is amazing, but is by far awful due to Oprah.","This is a great series, just like Planet Earth was. Shots are amazing and beautifully done but Oprah just ruins it! She shouldn't be in this. This is the American version which i'm sure lost BBC a lot of money. Go and buy the regular version with David as the Narrator. It is extremely better. You might have to order on line but is so much better"
1,"Thanks, Oprah, for ruining a perfect series.","I was gonna get the blu-ray narrated by David Attenborough, however it was sold out, so I bought the Oprah version. Simply put, this is awful. I saw the David Attenborough narrated version on the discovery channel a month ago and loved it, however I thought Oprah would have potential to do a good narration job. Well, lookie lookie, she instead raped it. She reads the whole thing as if she's reading a kid's storybook. ""Such creatures can NOT SURVIVE in this cold of temperatures!!!"" Ugh. Gimme a break. Stay away from this at all costs and buy the DA version. I gave up after three episodes it's that bad. I think I'ma sell this on eBay and get the original version."
1,Get The David Attenborough Version,"I would advise getting the Attenborough version. Do you remember how bad the Sigourney Weaver narration of ""Planet Earth"" was? Attenborough was much better. Don't waste your money on the Oprah version of ""Life"". I've watched the Winfrey version currently on Discovery...I wished I hadn't. Oprah should stick with daytime tv. She doesn't have the voice for this type of work.Thank goodness the Attenborough version will be available on June 1, 2010!It's too bad there isn't a zero star rating...."
1,Oprah - Terrible Narrator,"Really do NOT like Oprah's voice as a narrator. While watching the televised version she says ""octopuses"" instead of octopi (yes, I know there is debate on -pi versus -puses) but it sounded bad. Next, she pronounced ""ecosystem"" as ""echo"" system - again, it hit the ear as just really WRONG. Would take Signorney Weaver over Oprah any time. Signorney did a much better narration for Planet Earth. Oprah's voice lacks depth and character, and often she drops her voice so you can't hear what she's saying. She's not clear and crisp.BTW - My 18 year old's first reaction was negative upon hearing Oprah's voice, and she was quick to point out the Octopi and Ecosystem pronunciation errors. Don't waste your money on any version with Oprah narrating."
1,Buy the other version,This is the dumbed down version. Get the one with David Attenborough. This one is for junior high level of elementary school.
2,"Beautiful Program, Winfrey RUINS It","Supposedly, everything Oprah touches turns to gold, right? SOOO wrong in this case! She's truly the worst narrator for this program. Her sugary sweet, warm bedtime story voice does NOT match this series.. I honestly thought I was the only one feeling this way, but coming online to read the reviews made me realize I'm just one voice in a huge crowd that feels the same way. If there's any way to get a different narrator, please do. Even Oprah lovers have to pass on this one.. After a while, it just gets plain annoying to hear her!"
1,Do NOT buy THIS version!!!!,"The LIFE series is simply fantastic! I watched the entire original series which is narrated by the great David Attenborough.THIS version is narrated by the extremely lame Oprah. I agree with all the other reviewers here...she sounds like she is reading a bedtime story. My wife and I just caught 10 minutes of this Oprah version on TV and couldn't bare watching it. It's really that bad. I really wish someone, someday gets up the nerve to actually say NO to Oprah. From what I've read she ASKED Discovery to narrate this series.So do yourself a gigantic favor and make sure you purchase the series which is narrated by Attenborough, in Blu Ray. This Oprah version is simply a joke."
1,Oprah - Ono,"Oprah... Oh No... Oprah has Yoko-ed (or attempted to Yoko) this incredible BBC work! Buy the BBC, pre-Oprah, version. I did! Attneborough is the only person you want for this kind of work."
1,No thank you.,"Some people should just not narrate documentaries. Oprah Winfrey is one of them. All I can say is that I can't wait for the BBC version to be available in America, and that I was completely let down when Life aired on the Discovery Channel. The cinematography is as spectacular as to be expected, but do yourself a favor and watch the BBC version."
1,This version's narration is absolutely terrible,"I am just watching the debut episode right now on Discovery HD. The truth is that Oprah's narration is terrible. I'm actually not sure that I can keep watching, at this rate. I may have to just give up until I can get my hands on the Attenborough narrated version. I suppose it's possible that some may enjoy the Oprah narrated version, but it's hard to imagine why/how from where I sit. Uggggggggh, very bad choice by the producers... Very bad choice indeed. Bummer..."
4,Correct title: Mostly Vertebrate Life,"Pros: Absolutely amazing footage. Narration turns each section into a story. Appeals to multiple ages. Runs the gamut from unbelievably cute (baby seals) to rather gruesome (baby seals being eaten). My kids (10-22) tell their friends about it.Cons: Focuses almost entirely on vertebrates (although, to be fair, one whole episode is insects, and an octopus makes a showing), and it makes not the slightest attempt to survey the classes and orders on which it does focus. I took away a whole star simply because I wanted it to be 5x or 10x longer. If you think that's grossly unfair, then consider this a 5-star item.Summary: Don't use this as a substitute for studying your biology textbook! It's not intended for that. But it succeeds wonderfully at presenting vignettes (sometimes jaw-dropping) of the kinds of creatures most people think of when they hear ""Life."" It will whet your appetite for more in-depth study."
5,Simply Wonderful!!!!!!,"This documentary is amazing, watching this you realize how advanced the technology is these days and the idea of aplying it to reveal the wonders of nature, is brilliant, Sir David Attenborough does an amazing job narrating this stories, you really feel that he knows what he's talking about. Well, I just want to say to you that you can't go wrong buying this item, you'll be pleased by the way it transform your TV into a window to the natural world. With this you can say goodbye to all those boring animal documentaries in low definition and with a mediocre sight of animals, because this documentary turns them to LIFE..."
1,Another Review Criticizing the Orpah Narration,"Pick up the David Attenborough version; not this one! It is hard to understand the BBC's decision to release an inferior version, using Oprah's narration, for the American market. I can't fathom the reason for replacing a renowned naturalist with a fantastic narration style with a middling TV host."
5,Stunning - An Absolute Wonder!,"I watched the Oprah Winfrey-narrated version when it was on TV, and then ordered this version, instead. Nothing against Oprah; I just happen to enjoy my nature documentaries narrated by Sir David. And he is head-and-shoulders above Oprah when it comes to this type of thing!! The elegance of the blu-ray cinematography (which is truly stunning, by the way) seems to deserve the eloquence of Attenborough's crisp, British delivery. They complement one another so well!! And the bonus clips that show how the film's producers achieved some of the more stunning shots might be some of the most amazing portions of the entire series. I whole-heartedly recommend this to anyone who can appreciate the science OR the beauty of nature."
5,Life,It was very interesting and detailed. His work is always great. We had seen the orginial while we were in England and couldn't wait until it was available here. We have many other series of David's works.
5,"Don't listen to the....""Nay Sayers""...it's Beautiful!....","Wow! i'm glad I have my own! mind....because if I would ave listened to all the naysayers and oprah haters, I would have not ordered the DVD (oprah) version...but I am sooooo glad I did....we love! it....it's breathtaking and beautiful...and my grandchildren love to watch it over and over...and Oprahs voice is so calming...she did a wonderful job and it does not have to be..one! of anything...we can all remake whatever we like...(including our lives)....so stop all that negative talk...because it's a beautiful remake...oprahs voice is another reason I brought it outside it's beauty.....so have a great day all and let's understand...we can enjoy...both.Quamay R.of Brooklyn, N.Y."
1,PS3 Owners in US - This is not for you,"This Blu-ray disc content is of Video resolution: 1080/50i which means the frequency is 50 Hz. Most of the Blu-ray players in US can read this 50Hz content and convert it to 60Hz which is the playback standard in US. Unfortunately, PlayStation3 bought in US (Region A) does not play 50Hz content.So keep away from this UK edition, if your only playback device is a PS3.Note: Single star has nothing to do with the content; just to catch the eye of any PS3 owner who plans to buy this one."
5,The Best Blu Ray of Nature,Simply the best blu ray on nature have ever seen. Not to mention the picture quality ... Fantastic
4,Life witth David Attenborough,David Attenborough is an excellent narrator. An insight a minute at least. Nature as I would have never know it.
1,Whoa!,"I watch two episodes of this on the Discovery Channel. I won't say anything about Oprah Winfrey's performance, but the narrative and sound track on this were both appalling. This led me to cancel my order for the BBC version, until I can be assured that 1) The soundtrack improves the quality of the production, and 2) The narrative has some new meaning. What I saw in terms of content was, like, nothing new! This gives me more reservations about the BBC version. I mean, we have seen the Lammergeier go after bones before, right? In the Attenborough productions in the past, I have generally seen a lot of things that were new, that had never been filmed before, or at least viewed from the perspective that was presented. I'm not sure that there is much that is new here."
1,Oprah is god awful!,I haved watched the first four episodes of this show on Discovery Channel. Oprah is simply the worst narrator for a nature show I have ever heard. She ruined all of this great footage. I'm going to by the David Attenborough version instead.
1,"Why, Why, Why!",Why do they do this to us? Why replace THE voice of nature? Why do they think that people who love LIFE would want to be talked to in such a manner?
1,Unacceptable,"I honestly tried to give Oprah a chance, but her narration was able to completely ruin this for me. I loved Planet Earth, and I hate to see this wonderful documentary go to waste simply because they wanted more ""star power"". I loved Planet Earth because it focused on the grandeur of the planet and gave us some perspective. This idea of needing some celebrity to make life more interesting is appalling."
1,My wife and I agree...,"We don't really have any opinion of Oprah in our normal, everyday lives, but this show is boring with her narration. The visuals are stunning, but the narration just PLAIN SUCKS!!! I couldn't get past 30 minutes of it, and I tried, I REALLY TRIED. Mike Rowe would've been a much better choice, not the Queen of Sleep."
1,Don't try to Fix something that works perfect!,Why in the world would you replace the greatest most exciting narrator with Oprah that knows nothing of this subject. Get a CLUE Discovery BBC knows what they are doing stop polluting it. It was perfect leave it alone!!
5,The best I've seen!,I think BBC did a remarkable job on this documentary just as they did in the Planet Earth series.David Attenborough's narration is timeless. I particularly enjoyed the episode on Fish. The bits on the flyingfish was filmed in Trinidad & Tobago which is where I'm from.A definite addition to my blu-ray collection!
5,Breath Taking!,I have been watching nature documentaries before I knew how to use a toilet...basically I have pretty high standards for them. This Series is the best I've seen yet!!! Planet Earth Comes very close and may be as good...but this blu ray should be in everyone's collection! Get this BBC Version!
1,What a disappointment....,"I have been anticipating the showing of the Life series on the Discovery channel for the past few weeks, but after watching the first two installments tonight I was more than disappointed. Oprah is a terrible narrator. The editing is very poorly done, and even the soundtrack was not fitting. I didn't learn anything new with Oprah narrating - she lacks the passion and knowledge of David Attenborough.I will definitely be going with the David Attenborough version of the series - from the few clips I've seen, it appears to be an entirely different show. The footage is basically the same, but there are HUGE differences in editing that really impact the way the story is told. And Attenborough has a gift for bringing excitement and life into whatever he is narrating.This version of the series is actually quite Lifeless."
4,"Good, but not as good as the original ""Planet Earth"" series.","I thought that this series, while quite good, was not up to the same standard of excellence set by the original ""Planet Earth"" series. Our whole family enjoyed watching them, to be sure, but we weren't blown away quite so thoroughly as we were by ""Planet Earth"". Maybe it is just the fact that the original series was, well, ""original"". At any rate, I'm certainly glad that I bought these ""Attenborough"" discs from Amazon, rather than settling for the ""Oprah"" version that was available at a local store."
2,Depends on what you want this DVD for...,"There is no denying that the photography is excellent; and if you are just looking for something to entertain, you will like this DVD. However, as a classroom teacher, I would have liked more in-depth information for each topic. They do not explain thoroughly and students will have many questions. I also did not feel that Oprah's voice added to the overall quality of this series. Bottom line...I felt that someone had a lot of great photography left over from the making of ""Planet Earth"" and put it together to make ""Life"". I rate it 5/10 and not worth what it cost."
1,only purchase BBC version,DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION. I can not understand why they dubbed Oprah over this version. Another great series but this one is not even tolerable to watch because of the awful naraition.
1,Oprah's narrating ruins everything!,Life is Awesome! But Oprah Narrating ruins it BIG time! She sucks! I strongly recommend purchasing the one narrated by David Attenborough!
1,Not what you want.,This is certainly not the one you want. Go with the David Attonborough narrated one. Oprah Winfrey narrating is a great marketing idea to the mass of Americans who are otherwise a herd of sheep following her every word (literally)but this is not true form to the masterpiece. The real deal is in the Original and buy it on Blu-ray if you can.
4,Not bad,"Good, but about 50% of the stuff is from Planet Earth, although in this video they go into more detail in some areas. Worth the purchase though."
5,Great Movie! Better then the Oprah narrated one for sure!,"This movie is very good with the awesome Blu-day HD quality it has. You can see every detail and the whole movie is very long and amazing. If you have the money and a Blu-ray player, BUY IT! If not........ then buy it for someone else!"
4,BBC Life,I got a copy of the BBC series Planet Earth on DVD for UK Pounds 12/ from Amazon last year. Man what a series and the best 12 pounds I have ever spent. Now this ie Life wow. AND THAT TOO IN BLUE RAY. Even on a 32 inch LCD with Hi Dif ready ie in 720 mode 'out of this world'.
1,Just say no to Oprah,"The mere fact that this version is narrated by Oprah is reason enough for me to steer way clear of it and advise others to do likewise. Given that this is a woman who 1) supports Obama's agenda just because he's black, 2) actually believed ""an Inconvenient Truth,"" and 3) has more or less forgone Christianity and crafted her own wacky religion with herself as the center, thanks but no thanks - I'll stick with David Attenborough!"
2,Beware Discovery!,"BBC's Life series has already been aired in Canada, and it is breathtaking. As they did with Planet Earth, Discovery Channel has decided to replace the iconic and immensely believable David Attenborough with a ""celebrity"" narrator. I made the mistake of buying the Discovery Channel version of Planet Earth, then had to re-purchase the series in order to get Attenborough's narration, which was different not only in delivery, but in script. I ordered the new Life series as soon as it was available for pre-order, but only after checking carefully that it was the Attenborough version. Now I see that Amazon is offering both versions. Take your choice. I give Discovery's version 2 stars because the visuals will be the same. But for five stars, get the irreplaceable David Attenborough."
1,Amazing Visual Terrible Audio,"Im going to start by saying Life is amazing. Now having said that, Life with Oprah narrating is painfull. Its like she is reading to little kids, not only the things she says but the way she says them. Im so angry that this is the US version, its like pointing out that the average American needs a nature program dumbed down for them. Not all Americans are stupid! Save yourself some anger, get the David Attenborough version."
1,1080p VS 1080i,"Aside from the already correct and numerous reviews pointing out this set as inferior with the Oprah narration, one other inferior aspect of this set is that it is all presented in 1080i. The BBC version narrated by David Attenborough is presented in 1080p (with one exception: Plants is presented in 1080i). Don't cheat yourself by purchasing what is an obviously lesser package."
1,"Amazing footage, nauseating narration","If I wanted to be spoken to like a child by someone with a nasal voice, I'd sit in on a preschool class. Oprah's horrible narration makes these otherwise stunning visuals nearly unwatchable."
1,Slap to Attenborough,Oprah Winfrey? Give me a break. Why does Discovery continue to use other narrators instead of Attenborough. I truly don't understand. They are the absolute best with Attenborough.
1,Oprah is terrible as narrator,I liked the previous life series but was unable to continue watching this one with the cringe inducing narration by Oprah. Simply horrid.
1,Now I understand why...,I am watching the version narrated by Oprah on Discovery Channel. Listening it is simply unbearable. Even if the Discovery people want to have an American version they should look for someone who can pronounce words properly.Now I understand very well what the fuss is all about. I own planet earth and I don't want to imagine Oprah narrating that.
2,Narration Fail!,The only thing more epic than the cinematography is the EPIC failure by the producers in choosing the narrator. No one cares to hear Oprah narrate this.There is a reason this version has been selling cheap for so long...
5,Fantastic,"The Picture is stunning. Its head and shoulders above Earth. I love the ""behind the scenes"" of how they shot the different parts. Very entertaining and enjoyable.Worth every penny especially on blu-ray. Its something you put in to show off the picture of your TV!"
1,Are you serious?,"As a HUGE fan of BBC and of nature, I have to say that I am offended that they would choose somebody like Oprah to narrate this. I can understand why they do a U.S. version, but come on!!! They could have chosen anyone! I hope more people complain, so that their next show won't be narrated by Jerry Springer! Buy the UK version, David Attenborough is the best in the biz."
1,Go for the Attenborough version!,"While I'm sure the cinematography is just as enjoyable in the Oprah version, why would anybody want to listen to an American talk-show hostess narrate a nature series instead of a globally renowned naturalist who has been doing this for many decades? Must we Americanize a fine British documentary?"
1,This is an insult to our intelligence!,"Oprah's narration KILLS this series. It's awful. What made the first series so great is that it was beautifully shot, and it didn't have someone (Oprah) talking about it like her audience is in pre-school.I have stopped watching the series, and will be purchasing the BBC version. I'm very disappointed."
1,Why?,"Who thought it was a good idea to replace a well respected, knighted Englishman with Oprah? I thoroughly enjoyed the DVDs of Planet Earth and Blue Planet but why does Discovery feel the need to ""Americanize"" such a brilliant documentary? I can't even watch it on TV due to Oprah's poor, simplified narration."
4,"""Life"" is full of just that","I bought the blu-ray version of ""Life"" after checking out a review for it on a website, and I was not disappointed! The image is crystal clear, with great detail and minimal noise and grain (which in some cases is simply unavoidable while filming), and did I mention the detail! Absolutely amazing. And the hi-def audio included is quite impressive as well.The only thing that is (slightly) lacking are the assortment of bonus features. But as I purchased this product for the program itself, it is only a slight dip for me. And I can't imagine buying the U.S. Version so I could have the missing features, but be stuck with Oprah Winfrey narrating...who wants that? Definitely stick to the Richard Attenborough-narrated version!!!!Well worth your money."
5,Life,An excellent purchase! These types BBC documentary's are amazing. I had to go online to find this version narrated by David Attenborough. No offence to Oprah but I prefer listening to someone who know what they are talking about.
5,The best entertainment you can purchase for yourself and your family!,"Just beautiful and incredible. There is nothing more to say about it. If you have children and want to provide educational entertainment that will teach them to cherish the Earth and the life that lives on it, this is your best investment!"
3,Oprah???,"Watched the first two episodes on Discovery Channel and... very disappointed that Discovery and BBC let Oprah narrate the U.S. version of Life. For sure, they want her audience of millions. Still, she may be the queen of talk-shows but definitely not a narrator voice for such top notch nature show like this. I will definitely order the British version with Sir Attenborough. He brings so much more ""life"", natural fluidity, much more convincing, and great credibility to such an awesome show."
1,Didn't even waste my time watching without David,"This was an insult to the US market. Not to have David Attenborough narrate the US version is disgusting. It would be one thing if he hadn't been available, but to have him and not provide the US audience with his consummate talent was an extremely poor decision. I had been looking forward to this show for months. After hearing Oprah Winfrey for 10 minutes, I simply turned the channel and began my wait for the real version.Whoever made this decision should be caned."
1,Stick to the Original,"Echoing what most others have said, the American version of Life was such a let down. If you are going to spend the money, buy the original BBC version.And, for what it's worth, Oprah should stick to her day job as a talk show host and retire from the voice over/narration work."
5,Brilliant!,"The photography is fantastic, as you would expect from this BBC production, and it is topped off with the voice of the best Wildlife commentator of all time, David Attenborough."
5,Perfect!,"It has been around 6 years since I first watched Life of Mammals, and when Life was aired in local TV I still had that same feeling of awe and surprise that I had had back then. There are some typical scenes of big cats chasing prey, lemurs moving-moving, and sardines being bullied into forming a ball, that you, most certainly, have seen before. But what made me buy this series is the new material, if not a new perspective on things familiar. BBC has upped the ante with new camera tricks, super slow motion, and full HD."
1,Get the BBC version instead,"It's already been said over and over again, don't buy this version of ""Life"". Get the BBC version instead. It's just that simple."
5,Life,"I can watch these shows over and over. The only thing that sucks about it, is not having the dvd extras. On the regular version you get to see how the show was made and more detailed about there locations."
1,"Ugg, Thank Goodness I got this a Costco!",WOW! I got this last week without reading any reviews. Brought it home and immediately started watching with the family. We could not make it through the first episode. The narration is the worst I have ever heard in a documentary! It sounded as if Oprah was reading a bedtime story to 4 year olds! Who-ever it was at the BBC that decided it would be a good idea to get Oprah to replace the original narrator should be fired immediately! I will be getting the original BBC version!
2,DVD Life by Davis Attenborough,"Not what I wanted, I excpected the Life TV series narrated by Oprah Winfrey. Couldn't find original box to return it."
1,"Hodge Podge of ""Planet of Earth, etc.""","Commercially inventive!! This is a commercial thinker's ingenuity!! Add and mix recipe and call it something else. An experiment that most of the times work. Translating all I have just said: there are different scenes from Planet Earth and other documentaries, ""spliced"" it and presto - LIFE is made. I want my money back. Have you seen BARAKA ? There are scenes from that one too. Learned my lesson."
1,HDCP warning,"Bought this from ABC shop in Australia for $90! It has some kind of encryption which prevents HD out put over component, so I might just as well have bought the DVD instead, which was a bunch cheaper. Very disappointing. In contrast, I bought Planet Earth on blu-ray from Amazon UK, that plays perfectly fine HD over component, and cost me about $28 AUS for a 5 disc set. Must be because it's an earlier release."
3,Life,"Content was fantastic. The DVD production was terrible. It skipped, froze and blocked. Re-ordered a replacement set and still had minor problems. Amazon was very helpful, replaced free of charge and still offered to refund all monies. I descided to keep the set because it is so good."
1,Problems with DVD,"I bought the Blu-ray version of this DVD, only to be disappointed that I was unable to play the DVD on any of my SONY Blu-ray players, one of the players being only 6 months. What is more difficult is the fact that I was unable to reach out to the seller to get any help on the product. Completely disappointed, I had to return the DVD.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002UXRGM0/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"
3,Opera sucks,this was ok NOT near what earth was like and would have been way better if Opera didnt do it
2,Breaks easily,"The title for this item is somewhat misleading. It shattered in half when I used it for less than 2 days. If you meant to use it for solo performance, then it is great since it is light-weight and easy to flip around. However, if you use it for actual sparring purpose or some real work-outs, go somewhere else..."
5,Your collection is not complete without this...,"This album, along with many other Esham/Natas albums, is one of the best albums of the 90's. He keeps it underground here, but expands his style. This is not his BEST album, but it is one of. Best cuts are What, You Better Ask Somebody, Kill Or Be Killed, What Did I Do Wrong, Foodstamp, Any Style You Want, Because, Trick Wit Me, and If I Can't Have U, but the VERY BEST SONGS here and some of the best songs i have EVER heard are Killagram, One Day, Charlie Manson and Silicone. This album is a MUST for all esham fans, and ANY RAP FAN. Seriously you MUST check this out if you havent already. One of the best underground albums ever, along with the best Esham album EVER - Closed Casket. Also check out Kkkill The Fetus, and Boomin Words From Hell to hear Esham near his best, and get Natas' Doubelievengod and Multikillionaire: The Devil's Contract, because they are well worth your money."
5,Masterpeice,"this album is Esham at his prime, more focused than ever.Every song is morbid and nihilistic as hellits hard to beilive this album is already 10 years old!thats insane! i remember bumping this cd as a kid, this and closed casket alone in my room with the lights off and just think crazy thoughts.There is probably 2 songs i skip past when i listen to this cdbut i can listen to this album for 8 whole hours and still be entertained"
2,Cool case and good protection.,"Before buying this case, I kept my Treo 700P in pristine condition. 10 minutes after placing the phone in it and carrying on my hip.. it falls out. The screw that holds the case to the holster is not a good design. Luckily the case protected the phone. I have to give it a thumbs up in that area. I will be carrying the phone in the case inside my pant pocket from now on..."
3,Not what I'd expected.,"This book wasn't what I'd expected from the reviews. It is largely a reference guide and less of a learning resource. Definitions are presented clearly, but then the application of things wasn't fully explained. For someone new to print publishing, this isn't a 'how-to' guide. It's more of a reference material and to discover new things about print publishing you may not have known about. I would recommend this tentatively to anyone who wants to bulk up their reference library on print publishing, but wouldn't recommend it to a absolute beginner wanting to know more about print publishing."
3,"Well written, maybe. Crammed full of knowledge, hardly.","Yet another book from Adobe Publishing, toting their own horn. (it should be no surprise that any reference made to a DTP program is made to PageMaker, and not Quark), but that's just Adobe propaganda, easily ignored. Informative, yes, but I think somone forgot to proofread the thing.If it were a 'class room in a book' that's one thing, but being a 'print publishing guide', Adobe shouldn't so readily dismiss True Type fonts in preference for PostScript Fonts, Quark for Pagemaker...etc. I know it's an Adobe guide, but com'on, I expected them to give out a fairer treatment than that."
5,Great product,My husband uses this in his band and loves it. I don't know much about it but he uses it a lot.
1,Your basic pyramid scheme,"It's your basic pyramid scheme. Griffiths left his high-power Wall Street job for the simple life - teaching workshops on how to leave the corporate world for the simple life just like he did! The price of the book buys you his seminar on Barnes and Noble's online book club where, for your $13 and some hours of your life that you will never get back, Griffiths works to convince you that you, too, have the ""self-esteem"" to stop being a soulless corporate lackey. Griffiths sends you to some online hobby quizzes (which he didn't write himself) and then he tells you what your dream job might be. My top callings were ""librarian"" and ""FBI agent,"" which seemed to me might involve some level of professional conflict of interest. Then he spends the rest of the seminar smugly deflecting your ""resistance"" every time you point out that your secret dream to be an Aruban scuba diver might not be practical or dodging questions about how to feed two kids on $8 an hour."
4,Great moments and an even better presentation,THIS is how you should see Jim Lee's work! A4 size and in all it's glory! And you get some pages where Jim Lee actually gives you a commentary on his drawing of the issues. I love this book!!!
4,HUSH,"Noel, ""Arkham Asylum"" was written by Grant Morrison, not Neil Gaiman. The art was by frequent Gaiman collaborator, Dave McKean. Other than that, ""Hush"" is a great piece of work."
3,"Great art, mediocre story.","First of all, I love Jeph Loeb's writing most of the time. However, Hush simply did not live up to his past Batman work, most notably the Long Halloween.However, Jim Lee proves once again that he is a master of the full spread splash page. Lee doesn't a very certain style, and it doesn't fit all books. However, here it works perfectly (perhaps that's what caused Loeb's problems, writing too much to fit Lee's style instead of his own.)If you like Jim Lee, then, by all means, this oversized hardcover is worth picking up. However, I would really love to see Loeb's Batman Masterpieces done with Tim Sale get the absolute treatment."
2,"Great art, bad story","I have been out of comics for a long time and have recently rediscovered them with great excitement...as I'm older certain aspects have taken on a much greater importance mainly Story, story, story. For me at least, gone are the days where all I need was amazing art of my favorite super heros jumping from building to building. Writing has taken on a new importance SO with that being said you have to consider what is more important to you in a comic book/graphic novel the writing or the art.If all you want is amazing art this book is perfect for you, Jim Lee is at his best and I love seeing his Batman as well as the plethora of other characters. But the story in short, was boring, uninteresting and way too crowded. As another reviewer mentioned it seems that all the interaction with the other villains and heros is so Jim can draw all them for us. I would have been just as happy with a coffee table book filled with Jim Lee images....cuz really that is all this really is."
3,"Great art, bad story","I bought this one mainly because Jim Lee illustrated it, and that's about all it's worth. Maybe I'm being a bit harsh, but the plot is pretty lame. Fortunately, it's better than All-Star Batman and Robin."
5,Am I really the first?!,"Well... I figured this would be a G-Unit bashing(EVEN THO THAT ISH IS FUNNY!), no! This was actually an Oprah interview without Oprah! He cried,shed tears, talking about his family, talking about his upbringings, talked about how he got in the GAME! I had 2nd doubts whilst watching, but soon was brought back to reality... he started getting on Curtis Jackson! It just sucks, cause I thought this was going to be an updated movie of his upcoming video single that I happen to see on youtube with him of his dyed red woodpecker mohawk hair. But in all, it was a good documentary of The Game and his upbringing, it never talked about his brother's beef with him, Dre responding to his weeping from his 2nd album. But it I enjoyed it tho, if u seen Stop Snitching, u will get used to seeing his moms, but u will get a chance to see his dad and what he(GAME) did and how he really got shot and just to let u know, all his old homies are not anywhere in this DVD from his prior ones."
4,TomTom GO 510,"Easy to use. Compared to the Garmin Street Pilot III, the TomTom is easier to use but disliked the view of current position. Kept having to pan out to see location in relation to next destination. Found the info stored on rest areas was sadly lacking and not useful compared to Street Pilot. Did like being able to schedule an itinerary. The TomTom also doesn't ""talk"" as much as the Street Pilot. Liked that a lot. All in all its a good tool, but I missed my old Street Pilot."
4,Tom doesn't even know...,"This Tom Tom was a higher-end model, and does perform well. However, it does have some quirks. We have had to reset it a couple times, which is a nuisance when it turns off and won't come back on until you get a paperclip and push the reset button. Also, this device gets confused in certain locations, like military installations. Even with the downloaded updates, it shows roads that don't exist and tells us to take turns to drive through parking lots! Also, there are plenty of destination cities missing from its menu, which hurts trying to get to smaller-town destinations. Another plus is the list of restaurants and sightseeing locations in your route that you can access at any time."
1,Junk,"Bought my Go510 on November 14 as a Christmas present for the wife. It comes with only 90 days of warranty. Today is April 6 and the thing is broken. For a few days it had trouble finding the satellites, then just went dead. It was never abused, never left the car. Out of warranty for just 45 days, $600 wasted. It is junk! Stay away from it!"
1,Breaks after 1.5 years of service,"I bought this product about 1.5 years ago. Until a few weeks ago things were OK. Now each time after selecting the destination, it freezes when I accept the caclulations.TomTom helpdesk on the other hand has me go through software troubleshooting and I had to call them back 8 times and yell and them before they acknowledged their mistakes. They will send a replacement unit, but sufice it to say that I am done with this brand.TomTom stands for DumbDumb"
2,bad news,"I have old maps on my tomtom 510, I have lived in my house for about2&1/2 years and the tomtom has not my street but no streets around my block, My house I have in havasu az is not in my tomtom They need to update there maps. I would like to return this one!!!!!"
1,Save Yourself the headache!,"I purchased the TOMTOM 510 2 days ago and am returning it today. It is impossible to get customer service on the phone, The website doesnt' work.They admit they have defective windshield mounts and if you go to the website and enter your serial number they will send a new one. every time I entered my serial number and hit ""submit"" it says ""Improper format"".I copied the number off the back of my unit carefully. If they are this hard to deal with on something this simple how will they be if something really goes wrong, (after the 30 days). This is a British company that evidently thought they could market any kind of junk to the ""Colonials"" and get away with it. I am returning my unit while I still can."
5,GPS,a tool I will never agian be without FANTASTIC!anyone who makes a living on the road must have one!
1,Request from AMAZON.com,My Go 510 worked for only 1 plus weeks and had to be returned to TomTom for repair or replacement. I am very unhappy with the purchase. Ralph
4,"Great feature bundle for the price, but a bit temperamental...","I've had this unit for about a month now, took it from New England to CA and it performed perfectly. Bluetooth and IPod connectivity are great. The custom voices (from John Cleese to Mr T) are a hoot. The unit does crash sometimes (i.e. fails to turn on) but a quick reset is usually all that's needed. In the rare cases the unit has trouble locking onto a GPS signal, I'd recommend downloading the QuickGPSFix software through the Bluetooth wireless data link. That usually helps the 510 locate the GPS signal. The other thing to keep in mind too is that Tom Tom is a UK company, so tech support is a bit hard to reach and the services are somewhat Euro-centric. For example, they still don't have the real time traffic service for North America. Otherwise, this a a fine unit. I have heard of some quality control problems when this unit was first released, hopefully this has been resolved with the latest batch."
4,This thing work,"Contrary to the many reports that this thing does not work. This GPS does work and works very well. It has a nice 4 inch widescreen that displays the route in great detail. There are also many options, ones that could me turned off and ones that could be turned on.The first time I turned it on it took about 2-3 minutes to acquire a signal, which felt like a year. However, subusuqent starts takes much shorter amount of time and the POI database works much better than the POI in the previous generation of TomTom.One complaint though, the mount for the car is kind of weak, and the thing shakes and it seems like it's going to fall off anytime , and as a result, the power cable disconnects itself at random times."
2,Old Address Only Need Apply,"I have had my TomTom go 510 for almost a month yesterday I made my first long trip and used it. The 510 preformed well. However the Preloaded Maps from Tom Tom are out of date by many years. eg, the address on my Home changed almost 6 years ago,the TT 510 could not locate my home or any other areas that have changed their address due to E-911 are unavailable also. There are NO Current Updates on TT web site to correct this problem,So Bottom line is this,the 510 works well but maps are really out of date,so if you buy one do your self a favor and buy a current road atlas at the same time. I will return my TT 510 to the seller this morning for refund and buy a New Road Atlas."
1,"A GPS, a paper clip and a map","We were so happy when we bought our first GPS unit 8 months ago.But our experience with TomTom GO510 has been a frustrating one.The unit requires frequent resets, sometimes right in the middle of unfamiliar places.If we ever forgot to bring a pin, we had to resort to the good old map to get us out of the jam.To TomTom's credit, it did replace promptly our dead unit after initial 2 months of use.But the unit consistently failed to find our California home, even after a most recent map update. Granted, the housing development was only about 2 years old. But, we had reported its coordinates to TomTom right after we received the unit.It was even more ridiculous when the unit reported errors during a recent route computationfrom New Jersey to the JFK Airport.TomTom 510 is not worth the price."
5,"MOON, HERE I COME","Great product. I use mainly in L.A. traffic. I take a turn where I'm not supposed to (you know, to avoid breathing all that mess...) and the little tom-tom re-routes my way home, my way to the party, my way to Vegas.Very nice features: it finds points of interest on your way or before you get there. You could check traffic on the connecting your bluetooth phone to it (didn't try yet) and the speaker phone works very well too. It also retreives your phonebook through the bluetooth.It speaks using many different voices: one day Jeff gives directions, while a British Tina will do it tomorrow (I made up the names, but everything else you can do).Great buy for the money. Not too expensive for what it has to offer.My first GPS unit."
1,Piece of Junk,"I have had nothing but trouble with this unit. It could not navigate on the olympic peninsula in Washington state. Resets itself too often. Finally, when I really needed it one night, it died. Not a power issue as it was plugged into the car with the charge light on. Tried charging overnight - now it will not reset and not even come on. Returning it for something that works."
2,Underwhelmed,"I have been disappointed in my TomTom for a number of reasons; so many in fact, that I don't know where to start... Perhaps the Ben and Jerry's in the POI for Mammoth Lakes, CA when we were on vacation that landed us in the middle of an apartment complex (perhaps they have a condo there...?). Similar results for a number of other POI's. Some work, some don't...The website is difficult to navigate. Support is not easy to get. The connector for the AC adaptor falls out of the dock very easily. The software that connects the device to the computer is not intuitive or easy to navigate. I was allowed to purchase John Cleese as a voice, but wasn't allowed to load it to the device... I could go on (and on)."
5,I am very satisfy with this product,"This is my first GPS Navigator and I choose after reviewing all comments from customers and articles, I find it very accomodating with my need and I am very satisfy with it. Easy to use, no need to read the manual, and with blue tooth I can use my cellphone hands free and good sound quality.My only problem is to attached the suction to the car window, difficult and loose easily which somehow annoying while driving."
2,TomTom - Waste of Time,"Out of the box it was great. Easy to understand, big bright screen, multiple options for voices, etc... I got it as a birthday present (4/28) and I'm already fed up with it (5/1) and sending it back. The unit's been really fickle about turning on. I've already had to hit the Reset button 5-7 times. Also, the car adapter AND the home cradle don't charge the unit either. It may have just been a bad unit, but I'm trying one of the other brands next."
1,No Maps Found!,"After 1 day of effective operation, I used the backup function and suddenly my TomTom 510 could only find the maps for Guam. I have nothing against Guam, but since I primarily drive in the US, it presents a problem. So for the customer service has been terrible, and I'll give them another day or so before I return the unit to Amazon."
2,Fair,"I was disappointed at the instructions being less than heplful in knowing that the charging of the product for 4 hours prior to use was necessary or it would stop working.It was not revealed anywhere that the product had to be removed from car dock every day to be charged even if it was in the car charger and would stop working and have to be reset, which no instructions how to correct, warnings or directions are given . And last, not easily to get technical support on the phone."
1,sacharine,"Since his towering achievement on ""Focus"", various lables and conductors tried to duplicate that achievement. On this contractual obligation album, Stan does his best to contribute to Pop songs ill-suited to his style and the results are disasterous.I can't listen to Stan doing ""What the World needs now is Love sweet Love"" without wincing. So sweet it will make your tooth ache.Stan said once ""We will play what people want, but we are not willing to put on party hats"" or words to that effect. Here he is with a party hat and clown makeup. This is not real Getz and this is what drove him to record with Concord, so he could play the music he wanted.Don't get me wrong, Stan Getz is my favorite sax man, but not all of his stuff was great. Just trying to save you money. Caveat Emptor. See my list for much better Getz albums including ""Focus""."
3,"Ok, but not great!","This book is ok if you have no experience with VB, and is fair for reference. One glaring ommission is there is no reference to list or combo boxes. This book was not much help in my VB class. The text for class, ""Programming in Visual Basic 5.0"" by Julia Case Bradley and Anita C. Millspaugh, covered more topics, and was just a better book. Another good reference book was Peter Wright's ""Beginning Visual Basic 5""."
4,Very Pretty,"The earrings and necklace were surprisingly pretty. I think the color of the garnet was a little darker than expected and I was a little taken aback that it was sent in a small zip top plastic baggie, but they're very nice and were nice to give as a gift."
3,Barely Skims the Surface,"Bought the trainer with expectations that it would somewhat help in my preparation for the Core Exams. Somewhat disappointed as the material presented hardly skims the surface of the required readings. The teaching is excellent, just not deep enough for the real thing. For its price, it is just a high-priced review video, nothing more, nothing less.On the bright side, the questions are realistic, and the sophisticated engine allows for even adaptive testing as in the exams that you will face."
1,not at all recommended,"Nice glossy pictures. Text very uneven. Much of the advice is dated or simply wrong. Seems like ""cut and paste"" of some old parrot book from the 70's. We now know that parrots can speak some words in appropriate context and with comprehension. We don't give dog kibble anymore. I don't know of anyone who gives their parrot grit... The book seems to be pure merchandising..it looks pretty so buy it, you find out too late that the content isn't very useful."
1,Rip-off,"This book has gorgeous pictures, but the text is completely worthless. It reads like a so-so beginner's book on parrots from the 1970's. The is much misinformation, such as the statement that macaws do not talk! Do not waste your money on this book like I did."
2,Annoying talk!,"When I decided to buy this thermometer I thought that the fact that it can talk is awesome. When I got it, I found the talking really annoying, most especially since you can't turn it off! Also, it broke the first time it fell. I have a Braun ear thermometer and my 2 year old son threw it across the room but it still works fine. In addition to this, it is not reliable, I took my husband's temp three times and the readings were considerably far apart (100.8, 101.2, 100.3)I am very unhappy about this product and would not recommend it."
2,Worthless,"I bought this one since my regular thermonetor died on me. This thing is worthless. Everyone in my house got sick witht he ctomach flu and I needed to take temps. i pull my cool looking new thermonetor out and got some funky temps. I almost freaked out when I got a temp of 104 (by ear) for my four year old. Then I took it again and it said 97, the third time it said 101. i was so confused! Then i did it with her forehead and got 97 all three times! So I gave her some motrin and tried my 16 month old. She hated it! I had to pin her down just to get a reading and it said 95 all three times. Later that evening it said 100. Just now I tried reading my husband's temp and got 95 all three time by ear and forehead! WOW! I wish I kept the reciept!"
1,"Poorly calibrated, annoying ""talk"" feature.","In my experience ear thermometers generally read a little high, but this one was ridiculous: it repeatedly spat out temperatures in the 105 degree range, and we tested it against other thermometers that were giving us normal temperatures in the 98-99 degree range. That's some bad calibration, and there is no way to reset it.Also, the ""talk"" feature is really annoying. The voice has an odd New York accent, which is fine but it scared the heck out of my nine-month-old daughter. You can turn the ""talk"" function off, but it resets itself for each use and defaults to being on. That's the last thing you want when you go to take a baby's temperature in the middle of the night.We may have received a defective model, but we are returning it and replacing it with the Mabis Healthcare Instant Ear Thermometer, which doesn't have the forehead option or the talk feature, but works just fine."
1,Inaccurate,"When my child woke up from his nap today, the thermometer read his temp as 106.5 I had a difficult time believing that since he had already been to the Dr. and started his antibiotics. To test, I took my own temperature- which it claimed was 101. I did not have a fever.30 minutes later, it read my child's temperature as 101.1Highly inaccurate. Reading on the ear and forehead is great, a 2 second reading is great. Overestimating my child's temperature to a degree that would cause me to need to rush to the emergency room if it were correct? Not so great."
1,Not Accurate,"Simply put, human beings are never 92 degrees when healthy. Nor should my one-year-old's forehead reading be 8 degrees different from her ear. This product does not work."
2,Do not recommend - very inaccurate,"I just received this new thermometer n was excited to try it. Not only did it ave a light it has voice which announces the temperature.I was completely disappointed. How can a company put out a product that is inaccurate? People are depending on the accuracy of the product so they can properly decrribe their symptons to their doctor for proper treatment.I replaced a broken one by another mfg. right out of the package it said my body temp was 103.8 when it was actually 99.1. I kept checking and my old one fluctuated by a few 10 this of a degree, while the mobi fluctuated by as much as 4 degrees. No 2 readings were even close. Needless to say, I have to return it and buy one locally and,of course, another brand since I can't trust this mfg's product."
1,Do Not Buy !,"Basically the worst thermometer I ever bought! Very unreliable reading, and it is dangerous because you can miss a serious illness."
1,Never Seemed Accurate,Never felt like this product worked right. Taking multiple readings in the same place would have result in a 4 degree range. Had it for a year and a half....gonna throw it out...worthless.
1,awesome idea...,We've had this thermometer for about 2 years. It seems to do well for adults. I love the features for kids but I cant rely on the temp readings. When used on my sons forehead it never seems to indicate a fever when he clearly has one. If I hold it just at his ear... not inside the ear... there is at least a 2 degree difference. I cannot recommend this product for children.
1,Don't buy it,This is the first time I'm leaving a review but I feel strongly about this. I am desperate for a reliable method to take my children's temperature and they are too old for anal method. I bought this thermometer hoping at least one of the ways would work but they don't. the other day my son was sick I took his temperature by ear method and it said he was 107.3 degrees. I took the other ear and it said 107.4 I took it by forehead and it said 99.7. I broke down and took it anally and it was 99.3. Then when his fever did go up to 102.6 (anal method) this thermometer said it was 99.5 (one ear) and 99.6 (other ear) forhead said 97.7 This is a totally worthless thermometer. I love the idea and wish it worked but it doesn't. Don't buy waste your money!
1,Don't buy it!!,Listen to the reviews... Don't buy it!! Complete waist of $$$ does not read correctly (my son had a fever took his temp 3 times the readings said... 99 102 & 104) and talk opion is so loud & annoying! Don't buy it!!
1,Awful waste of money,"This thermometer varies really bad. Most of the time says 102 or so whem there is no fever. Not operator error either, my husband and I have both tried. I have two kids under 5 and need a thermometer that works. This one does not do not waste your money.On a good note the back light is great if the temperature read right."
3,Not consistant,"This works well to tell the surface temp of your baby, however I wouldnt trust it to recognize a fever. The display is nice and it saves the previous temperatures. It just isn't consistant enough."
1,not accurate,"As others have said, this thermometer reads anywhere from 95-101 within a few seconds when taken from the same area on the body. I cannot trust this thermometer with my newborn son and would not recommend it to anyone. Luckily, the return with amazon was hassle free."
2,"Great features, good price, unreliable readings.","This looked like an excellent product - just what we needed for our preemie twins, but we could never get verifiable results. Check their temp 3 times, get three different results. I even tried it on myself several times. In the ear seemed to possibly work, but their ears are too tiny to that, plus they tend to move a lot.The features are great and it's a good size/shape for easy usage. I just can't use a product for my kids I can't trust."
1,Very inaccurate!!,"It reads from 97 to 102 1/4 inch apart..get a different reading every time..Horrible thermometer and I'm only using it on adults..I'm an RN..if we had variables like this we wouldnt have this product in our hopital..would have done 0 stars if could,,it did come in timely fashion..but 3 times in 6 mos I've used it, it was useless and a guessing game"
1,Impressed at first...not anymore,"I got this thermometer when my son was a month old. It was great; I loved it. But then this past week my son was sick and I was using it. I knew it wasn't right because it said my son was 99.4, but he felt ALOT hotter than that. I got him into the clinic and packed my thermometer with me. When I got to the clinic he was 104.5. I used mine again right after the nurse left the room and it read 99.3. NOT GOOD! My son ended up in the hospital and I think we could have caught it sooner if this darn thing had worked. I'm gonna try to find something else that is hopefully reliable."
1,Tells me Nothing!,"I received one of these digital ultra thermometers as a gift when my daughter was released from the NICU. I was happy to have a high-quality, easy to use thermometer for when she got sick again. Imagine my surprise when now, 4 months later, she gets her first illness and I find this thermometer to be completely useless! I check her temperature 3-5 times in a row, alternating between temple, forehead, and ear and get readings between 94 and 100 degrees! This tells me nothing! I don't know if this is a defective thermometer or just a terrible product."
1,Dangerously Inaccurate,"We bought this thermometer for our son not long after he was born and he's 2 now. It has never given us a reliable reading. Today I was taking his temperature and it said 101, then 5 minutes later it said 98. We bought a new thermometer and it turns out he was at 103.6!! We tested the new one on ourselves and it's definitely accurate. So, if you want a thermometer that's going to be accurate (which I'm sure you do)...do not buy this one."
1,Very unreliable and inconsistant readings,"This thermometer is about as good as not having one at all. On one reading it will say 102.7 (which nearly stops your heart) and the next reading (within seconds of the last) will say 95.3 - and the readings continue on like that. Each consecutive reading will have several degrees difference, so you have no idea what the true temperature is."
1,Very unreliable,"This thermometer initially seemed like a great idea. We noticed that it gave wildly varying readings taken within a minute of each other, but at first thought it was due to our daughter's young age and used a rectal thermometer instead. Now, she is a year and a half old, and I realize I have never found it to be reliable at all. She is currently sick with a mild virus, and I wanted to find out if she has a fever. The thermometer told me her temperature was 98.8, 97.3, and then 100.4 as I took her temperature over the course of a minute or two on pretty much the same spot on her temple. I really would not recommend this product; why use something that you need to take several readings, and compare it to taking your own temperature (as I've read others do), etc. We are shopping for a new thermometer and should have done so much sooner!"
2,Okay Product,Sometimes it shows erratic reading which put us in trouble. Battery life is too short. I am not in position to return this product as it was opened already.
1,Worthless,"Spend your money on a real thermometer. You can take 10 temperatures in the same spot and they are all different. One will be 98.1 and one will be 107. Each time they are different.The only good thing I have to say about this is you can make it quiet, and it is back-lit.MOBI YOU FAILED!!!"
1,HORRIBLE!!! Don't waste your money,"I loved the idea of a forehead scan thermometer, but this one is just awful. I have never had 2 readings anywhere close to each other when taken within seconds of each other. The last time I tried it, one said 97* and the other was 102* (Taken immediatly after). Even trying the ear read, it's completely off! The only reason that this thing hasn't been tossed in the trash is that I am hoping someday it will be recalled and I can get my money back! I will never again throw away packaging before trying something out and making sure that it really works!I've gone back to my super-cheap, trusty Vicks underarm thermometer! Don't waste your money on this piece of junk... By the way, it got one star because they don't let you select no stars."
1,Completely Inaccurate,"This thermometer has never given us a reliable reading. My 11 month old daughter woke up in the middle of the night and obviously had a fever. I took her temperature 3 different times and had 3 completely different readings 97, 102, and 98.5. That is a lot of variation. When I took her to the pediatrician, she actually had a temp of 103. This has happened on several occasions. I finally threw the thermometer away because it is completely useless!"
1,This Thermometer is a JOKE,"I hate this one, it will give never give same reading again. Readings fluctuate by 2-3 degrees. I took readings one minute apart and got 99.0 100.5 and 101.4, when I was not feeling any temperature at all. My son was under some fever and it showed 107 degrees.Total waste of money and time."
1,White?,"I have another identical pair, except for the XS model which is straight connection instead of the L. So one of my 9006 XS's went out. So I bought these to replace 1 bulb. After I replaced I noticed it was not white. But the typical yellow. Looking at the lights it was pretty clear. So I thought it must be my imagination. So I replaced both with these new ones. Nope not my imagination, still yellow, brights and fogs are nice and white same companys bulbs. Even the package says white zeon. So I'm not blaming the seller but street glow. Going to drop another $25 on the XS's and hope they are WHITE."
1,disappointed....,I was hoping for a more gritty up to date view of life but this looked like it was done in the late 80s and I never even made it to the other discs due to being disappointed by the first hour of the first disc. Not recommended at all.
3,"nice solid towel bar, no instructions.","I think I will like this towel bar if I can ever install it. There were no instructions in the box or on the box, so I had to download instructions from the website. It comes with drywall anchors that I have no confidence in, so I bought different ones. And the set screws require a tiny hex wrench, although the size is not specified, so I'll have to take the fixture to the hardware store and find a hex wrench that fits. I'm giving the product a three, because it looks nice but the installation is not user friendly.Next day. Okay, I rescind my cranky review. The drywall anchors that are provided are better than the ones I bought. We'll see how well they hold up. And, what do you know, the itty bitty wrench was included in the bag of screws and anchors. Easy to miss. Anyway, now the towel bar is up and looks splendid. I still give it a three for lacking instructions."
3,Harman's book,"It was o.k. Some of the issues he discusses just seemed a little trivial and semantical in nature. I liked the section on rationality a lot better than for example, the one on meaning."
1,Do you need this?,"You may think you need this but maybe not. I ordered, ""Security Chain Company SC1038 Radial Chain Cable Traction Tire Chain - Set of 2"" along with the Rubber Tightner but lo and behold, there is reference after reference in the installation instructions saying DO NOT use the cable chain with the rubber tightener! SO don't order it if you order the SC1038 cable chain. This probably goes for any of the other cable type chains. I think it IS a good idea for the non-cable chain tire chains. BUT. I've ordered the tire chains that use chains and they ALREADY come with the rubber tighteners. So, now you know. If in doubt, order them but be prepared to return them. Amazon is always good about returns...."
5,Maybe you don't need it.,"I ordered chains that did not come with such a tightener, so I ordered the tightener separately. Then when I read the instructions with the tire chains, it suggested I not use the tightener because the chains need to move relative to the tire, so you don't wear holes in the tires where the connectors on the chain ring meet the tire. The chains should be able to move relative to the tire to get uniform wear. I have to admit that this makes some sense. I have always used tighteners before, but I have noticed wear spots on the sidewalls of the tire where the metal pieces that connect the traction chains with the circle chain meet the sidewall. I think the trick is to get the chains on fairly tight, but not too tight and NOT use a rubber tightener. At least this is what I plan to do. Now that I have the tighteners I can take them along for insurance. The actual construction of the tightener seems fine, a fat rubber band with stout metal hooks."
1,Quick Grip,"This item was advertised on Amazon as ""goes with Security Chain"" items commonly purchased. When I read the Security Chain direction, it said ""do not use quick grip....."
3,Cheap tightener - exactly what I was looking for...,"If you're looking for a high-quality chain / tightener system, avoid this item.Our roads ice up once or twice a year, and I need to chain up for short trips. This tightener does exactly what it is purposed for. My goal was to buy the cheapest, functional chains for my little Honda Civic. The chains alone were hard to tighten enough for a good grip - adding this $4-$5 tightener makes all the difference, and is easy to attach.Worth the effort..."
5,perfect...,"if you want to know the secret, just watch it and let your new live begin. everyone from us use the secret but we dont know how exactly is works. some of do it beter other do the worst they can not even realize it... the ""must have"" book or DVD.PS. for every one who understands: P.M.A. :D"
5,The Secret DVD,I've ordered The Secret DVD for my sister who lives in Poland. The DVD is in polish and is in format PAL. They use that format in Europe. In US diifferent system is used(NTSC) so I was never able to send her any DVD's from US because of that problem and now I'm so grateful I was able to do it so she can enjoy The Secret too. I ordered the DVD on thesecret.tv website but the checkout is with amazon. Very happy with my purchase. It arrived on time without any problems.
2,"Awed, then Disappointed","I purchased this screen saver pack hoping that I'd be able to import the pictures into my current screen saver software, WebShots. However, Second Nature has created a similar screen saver program and the pictures are saved in a proprietary format. Therefore, you either use the screen saver program provided or say 'Bye bye' to your investment. Second Nature offers 1000s more pictures at a website, similar to WebShots. Unfortunately, I'm too vested in my current program to begin anew.Also, the resolution of the photos doesn't hold when your display is set to 1280x1024. Most of the photos are blurry. Perhaps at 800x600?"
2,bo staff cracked,"Unfortunately, the bo staff that we purchased was cracked shortly after purchase. Normal use by 18 year old son learning to use the bo staff. Certainly not the best product on the marked."
2,Disappointing greatest hits package,"If you want PL's best material, you're better off with One Second and Draconian Times, or if you have a different favorite album, go with that. It may cost more that way, but you won't regret spending a little bit more. Nick Holmes' booming voice and the rich instrumentals feel like they could fill God's own arena and hence the studio tracks sound muffled. Shoestring production does not help matters. All this would add to the charm, much as it does for early Velvet Underground albums, but a greatest hits collection deserves better.That said, Paradise Lost recordings can be impossible to find in the States and I could kick myself for not buying every one of them when I had the chance. If Reflections is the only disk of theirs that you can find, by all means, buy it. But if you can purchase the original albums instead, it's money better spent. If you already have their other work, pass."
5,One word chicken wings!,"One word chicken wings! O.k. So that's two I used to go to Chevys just for the Wings o fire then they made me the mistake of selling me their recipe and I never went back to eat! I actually made a bunch of recipes from this book for a group of co-workers including a couple of Guys from Mexico. They couldn't believe a ""Gringo"" could make such authentic food!"
4,What I Expected from Chevy's,"Everything you would want from this very good Tex Mex chain is in this book - including their famous salsa. A good buy, if you're as big a fan as I am."
3,"Good, but much prep.","This is a very good cookbook, but it requires building a pantry full of intersecting recipes/prepared bases vitally important to creating end result dishes in this book. To attempt to do it all from the ground up, virtually at ground zero would take you days to complete an entire/full meal setting. (Something to consider when purchasing this book.)Conceptually the book is great, the concept being fresh ingredients prepared in a traditional way--but overall preparation is very time consuming, indeed."
3,Great book - takes time,"I bought this cookbook for my husband who enjoys the Chevy's Fresh Mex Restaurant here in our city. I thought we would have fun making some of the recipes together. The book is good, just be aware that most of the recipes take a lot of preparation and time to create and they use a lot of special ingredients that may be hard to find. We have only made one of the dishes so far and it didn't turn out that great, but it was fun to try it. We now have a lot of left over ingredients that can't be used for anything I normally cook. I guess if you're used to cooking a lot of Mexican food with fresh ingredients the book would be more beneficial to you."
5,Great info & fun reading,"This is full of fun, interesting and educational facts and tidbits about the Titanic, which are age appropriate for my 9 & 11 year old grandchildren. It's a keeper."
5,Very Interesting,"This book has lots of informative and interesting facts about the Titanic. Whatever your interest level, this book probably has something in it you didn't know.For Titanic aficionados, this is a great reference book."
3,Get your list of facts for FREE!,"I bought this book from a high school book order thinking that of all the Titanic reserch I had done, this would be my best book. However, the book was made for middle school kids giving the basic facts every book about Titanic kids books gives, with a few new things. I think this book does have excellent facts but the book is just a list from page to page. If you want to know everything about Titanic I suggest you just get on the web., get fifty pages about Titanic, and save your [money]."
5,Great book,My grandson is fascinated with the Titanic and just loves this book. He loves reading all of the interesting facts that are contained in it!
5,Great Information and an Easy Read,"This is a great book of Titanic facts. Some are very common, some are obscure and others deal with misconceptions. Very informative! Has a lot of facts and tidbits that we didn't find in any other material! It's written in sections, so if you have just a couple minutes to look at some questions and answers, that's fine, or you can read through the whole book at once. Highly recommended."
4,Just what you would expect.,"This is a nice, colorful book with a few surprises. I read it with my eight year-old and he really enjoyed it. There are a few facts I did not know but many that I did. This would be a great starting piece for a young person just finding an interest in Titanic history but if you have several books you can probably bypass this one."
2,more for kids,"Nice book, but it's more for kids then adults. Was expecting more. and also, why not facts on the movie a night to remember?"
4,A Great Companion - plenty of interesting information,"Being a TITANIC fan since I read A Night To Remember in the 7th grade (many, many years ago), I foud this book a worthwhile purchase especially with the anniversary of the sinking only a few months away. A majority of the information is very interesting, but at times just juvenile, directed at children and only listed to fill pages. Very well illustrated. Not disappointed - much information I didn't know, just a little bit juvenile at times for my taste. I won't ruin it for you why it is called 882 1/2 Amazing Answers - have to read it for yourself. A fan of the Titanic should know it already."
1,I looked at this book in the store....,"... and promptly thought `who thought it was a good idea to leave out the niqud [vowel points]?' Transliteration is all very nice, but learning proper pronunciation is impossible without the niqud. My advice is, learn the alef-bet and get a decent dictionary."
3,Websters Hebrew Dictionary (transliterated),"Though interesting in its attempt to help non-Hebrew readers and students find meanings to articles and magazines with expressions in Hebrew, it doesn't work too well. Since the pronounciations of the speaker are not always the way the dictionary spells or sounds out the word in English. A little disappointing since I read an English newspaper (Hamodia)and even though their Hebrew words are italisized, the spelling in the paper is different than that in the dictionary.Not as helpful as I Hoped."
3,Hebrew Dictonary,"A fair dictionary because it is not very extensive. It omits grouping by category, e.g., travel, furniture, food. But I did like the fact that one doesn't have to know how to read Hebrew to find definitions because of transliterations."
1,Useless object,I wonder who may need a thing like that. I have to make a double effort: guess what could be the transliteration of the word and then look for it. Never thought a thing like this could be conceivable.
5,Excellent Hebrew Helper!,"Excellent book for those who are beginners, it has the transliteration and the Hebrew letters, which helps pronounce it correctly. Five stars for excellent work!!!!!"
2,not very useful,"I found this dictionary to be of no use in my learning Hebrew. I was attracted to this dictionary because the format and fontsize suggested that my eyes would not suffer the fate of the old Persian miniature painters while using it. However, its primary (and critical) failing is that if you are trying to translate a Hebrew word whose pronunciation is unknown to you, you are really out of luck. You have to guess at several different transliterations; this can be a very lengthy chore, sometimes without reward. If your only need is to translate from English to Hebrew, this is indeed a very nice dictionary. But if you need to translate words in Hebrew to English, get another dictionary."
2,Useful information but best suited for intermediate + students.,"Everyone has noticed the problem: Romanized transliteration is confusing. Someone else made the excellent recommendation: learn the alef-bet (and the pointing system) and use a real dictionary.Now that I am more familiar with written Hebrew, this dictionary has become more utile. It provides excellent instructions on pronunciation of Hebrew words. It is also handy for identifying a word that I have only heard spoken: I can just look up the transliterated word to find the meaning and the correct alef-bet spelling."
4,Good for novices,"For those of us still getting used to spelling in Hebrew, this is a great help because the words are transliterated."
3,Sibling Rivalry,"Doris is shopping for her first grade school supplies. Her parents buy her a new raincoat, pencils, and a lunch box. Her little brother is certain he needs a lunch box just as much as Doris. He dreams about a different lunch box for every day of the week. In the end he gets his lunch box and a hug from his sister. This brightly illustrated book is a simple story about family and sibling rivalry.Illustrated and written by the same duo that created the award winning book Just us Women, the non-library bound version has an illustration of the Boy, whose story this is, on the front. Apparently Amazon.com does not carry that version. It also has a write-up about the committment of Caines and Cummings to creating books that are role models for black children. That is the copy I purchased.The 3 rating is based on the fact that, as a reader and storyteller, I prefer imaginative stories."
2,Disappointing for a Seinfeld fan.,"Except for the monologue, it had some pretty weak material, I thought"
3,Just another RPG,"I like the game, but to me there is nothing that really stands out about it. It does follow D&D rules pretty good, even with the attacks and rolls to save and etc. The graphics are average. One thing that gets me is the fact that I feel like I go back and forth back and forth. My girlfriend walked in the other day and said, ""I see you play this game a lot and it always looks like you are doing the same exact thing."" That would be going back to town all the time. BUT, that is just my experience and I'm only partially through the game. Good story line and stories behind the weapons and seperate quests. But for the most part I find the game to be boring."
4,icewind Dale the collection,"Icewind Dale was one of the best rated D&D games ....around for a good while. It is considered to be a ""classic""> i enjoyed the story telling and the interface was easy to learn and use...leo"
3,SOUNDTRACK NOT INCLUDED LIKE STATED,>>>Also included is the Icewind Dale Soundtrack by critically acclaimed composer Jeremy SouleNO! It does *NOT* Include the Soundtrack like the product description states.I bought this more for the soundtrack than the game and it is not included.
4,"Brilliant blues from the ""Wonder Kid""","I first heard of Derek Trucks this summer when I went to see the Allman Brothers for the first time. My first thought was ""Wow this kid can play!"" (Ok, so he's a few years older than me. So I shouldn't call him a kid.) I was thrilled to find out that he had two cds out and the first one I acquired was ""Out of the Madness"". It didn't thrill me on first listen, but every time I listen to it I love it more. My favorites are ""Kickin' Back"", a relaxing blues jam, ""Alright"", a more rocking number, and ""Deltaraga"", which combines blues with Indian classical music. If you like the Allman Brothers, blues, or all of the above, I'd recommend this highly. Who knows what Derek will be doing in a couple years?"
3,Great talent,"He can obviously play, but there are too many throw away tracks on this CD I just want to skip over when re-playing it. I seem to be a lone voice out here. Buy it, but don't expect perfection."
3,Kamal Sagar,"Like most of Derek Trucks work, some of the tracks on this album are truly amazing. Hitting the same highs like Santana - definitely worth having in your carefully selected library of good music."
2,Out of my mind,"I expected more of a jam band cd, like Allman bros but it was more of an experiment from trucks on what he can do. Wasted my money of this cd."
4,The next great one...,"One listen to this album and you will come away with the conviction that Derek's daddy Butch Trucks (drummer for the Allman Brothers Band way back when) must've had an affair with Mama Allman and when the baby was born, he was sent to be raised by Carlos Santana... Duane Allman lives in this young player; his soaring slide guitar runs are honed from the same steel as the senior Allman brother. The fusion style instrumentals hark back to mid-seventies vintage Santana and Jeff Beck. A tremendous tour-de-force from someone so young. Trucks, Shepard, and Lang will form the 21st century version of Beck, Page, and Clapton. You heard it here first..."
4,A must have for the modern blues collection,This album is great and raw. Derek is an amazing talent. here he finds a link between blues and jazz and just works the cusp beutifully. if you know the early Stevie Ray vaughn stuff then you know how good raw can become when roasted just fine.
2,"Looks good, but the Guppy didn't like it and was almost injured by it.","I bought this because I have a lone guppy in a ten-gallon tank, and I found out the guppies like to hide in order to relieve their fish-stress. Well, my guppy swam through this floating log about twice that I saw, but never adopted it as a ""hang out"".Also, these floating logs really do float and one day I saw to my horror my guppy trapped between the log and one of the sides of the aquarium. So I took it out and now it's in my ""another great aquarium idea that didn't work"" box. I'm rather disappointed.This very nice looking product could be improved by some sort of anchoring mechanism that would keep it from floating out of control in tanks with moving currents of water. I would have jury-rigged such a mechanism myself if the guppy liked the log, but he didn't."
4,Good hiding place for shy cichlids,"This realistically ugly plastic log floats on the surface of the tank providing a hiding place for brooding mouthbrooders and chewed-on males. Like penn-plex's cliffs and caves, it provides a hiding place away from the prime territory at the tank bottoms, so the dominant males leave it alone. There are no suction cups to fail and it sits in a stable orientation and does not roll. It boast a ""feeding hole"", but I wouldn't use it. If the aggressive fish find food in they won't leave it alone."
4,turtle liked it,"our slider was small and we werent sure if he would like this log. Well, he did. it does float around and he still was able to catch up with it and bask in the sun on the top part. He hides inside if he needs to, but he used it and that;s all we hoped for"
5,Sam,The turtle log is perfect for small pet turtles. Our turtles absolutlty love it. Not very large so make sure it's the size you want.
5,Reminiscent to Meerkat Manor,"I loved Meerkat Manor on Animal Planet on TV. I donated to the Meerkat farms in CA. Had a Tshirt, the stuffed meerkat, the whole works!I got this and it was so neat when I finished! Didn't take forever. Wasn't super delicate. And it was fun to do. If you like these neat little animals, you'll love this."
5,Orlando Furioso at last !,"First saw this opera in Verona, Italy in the summer of '79 & have loved it ever since. I already own two vinyl copies of this work, but was glad to see it on CD at such an affordable price...which I jumped on.I've read that there are newer & more complete recordings since this land-mark one was made many years ago, but for me Marilyn Horne will always beOrlando Furioso.CDs arrived promptly & in apparently flawless condition. No time to play so far, but I expect they will be fine. ***J.Q."
5,Two thumbs up!,"I have had this video for a number of years.If you don't have this video in your collection,you're really missing something. The fact that Ronnie constructs these videos is all the more reason to buy this video! Ronnie has proved once more that he does'nt let his blindness get him down. He is really a one of a kind entertainer!"
3,Nothing special,"I certainly don't see many fizzy candies around, so if that's your thing then you might like this product. The taste isn't anything special, though.They leave an aftertaste - not wholly unpleasant, but I would rather have vojo, or warp mints. :)"
4,Really pretty good!,"I was a bit concerned when I saw the price, and then the size of the box. But in the end it has held up very well to the beating my 9 year old son and his little buddies dish out on it every few days. Build time was about an hour with two adults working. Directions are a bit flaky and you need to pay a bit more attention when it comes to how to install/tension the net. The only tough part was getting it anchored to the ground. Our soil here is full of rocks, so finding some place to drive in the weak anchors they supplied ended up in broken or bent anchors. I essentially had to make a trip to the hardware store to contribe some heavier ones. That aside, this was a pretty good deal and provides way more meaningful soccer practice than a standard net."
5,franklin sports soccer rebounder goal,It was fairly easy to put together. It has held up well this spring with both of my girls enjoying hours practicing in the backyard.
3,Net ties rot,"Worked well for the first 2 months, but then the bungee ties for the net started to break from sun rot. I live in North Dakota, so the sun really isn't that strong. The net was placed in an area that is shady half the day. Now I need to purchase a replacement net and straps. Bummer."
3,Works. Bungee cords not terribly durable.,"This is our second Franklin rebounder. They work fine, but the bungees aren't terribly durable.This one arrived with a couple of torn spots in the net. Franklin replaced the net.The bungee cords that hold the net are somewhat difficult to attach. Once attached, they'd be difficult to remove."
2,not too pleased,I purchased this product for my son & daughters -- all high school aged kids -- we are happy to have this unit however displeased with the net and bungee cordsThe net has two holes in it and we snapped 7 bungee cords -- not sure if the age and power of the kicks has anything to do with it -- but it was purchased in December and we did not get 4 months with this and we are looking to replace parts.Easy to assemble / frame is good / hold downs not so much / net and bungees could use some girth
3,The net has broken twice on the same product.,The net is not strong enough on the sides so it breaks and the ball goes through. It has happened 2x on 2 different goals. T
4,an excellent conventional horror flick with some great ideas,"This movie has everything I look for in a good horror flick - a group of young people ending up in the middle-of-nowhere, a monster, an antagonist. This has all the feel of Spielberg's ""Duel"", but it really has some great scary points. The sexy scenes are sexy, the scary ones really give a chill, and the director even goes so far as so make me laugh when he wanted to, even though it's not a comedy. The actors did really well, and it had a very distinct sense of realism to it. I certainly hope that this film gets a wide viewing by others; I'm especially hoping to see more movies from Sean Dillon soon! Two thumbs up!!"
1,Less than 1 star!,"Do yourself a favor! Do NOT listen to the good reviews of this movie. I wasted time on watching this movie last night and feel embarrassed to say I finished it to the end. (mostly for the laughs of how bad!). Terrible acting and dialogue. I made a game at counting how many times the phrase, ""what the f...!"" was said. I think the director of the movie bought the camera to film this at a local Salvation Army. The so called ""twist"" on the monster was horrendously ridiculous. If you would like a night where you and some friends want to sit and have a ""Mystery Science Theater"" make fun of fest, than this would be recommended. Other than that do not waste your time and money. Even if it was a nickle!"
2,H B Surprise Gourmet Gift Tower,"I was mostly disappointed with this gift basket. It was very expensive for the contents. It presents very well: colorful and about 18"" tall but the boxes contained a lot of packaging material and therefore the quantity of food products was minimal and the food was not especially tasty. I certainly would not recommend this purchase to anyone else."
2,Will Never Purchase Again,The cake was stale when my husband received this gift for his birthday. The only thing edible in this package was the hard candy.
1,Beware,These were nice glasses but three of the four arrived broken where the stem and base come together.
1,"Cheap, and a pain to use","I purchased this as an inexpensive second Capo to have as a backup when I recently misplaced a Planet Waves Capo. I picked up the Shubb Capo at the same time. The Shub works great, and you can put it on using one hand. The Dunlop is a pain to attach to the neck, and is made cheaply. I would save your money and pop for the Shubb, or the Planet Waves dual action Capo, another one hand on and off design. A few more bucks will make life much easier. If I were to choose one, I would probably go for the Palanet Waves, as it is a great design, and solidly made."
5,"Zondervan NIV Study Bible, Large Print","With the exception of the box that the Bible was in, it was in excellent condition and the Bible it self is just what I wanted.Tnank you and God bless"
3,Great Bible ... but the RED print?,"There is no finer study Bible in print. It is heads above anything else sold and as far as the study aids are concerned, it deserves a five star rating. However, it appears that ZONDERVAN (the publisher) is incapable of printing red text in any consistent manner. Before purchasing, CHECK out the gospel accounts and the red text to ensure it is easily readable. I purchased this Bible (and probably will again) because of the quality of study aids and the fact that I can get a large print edition. I hope some day they can clear up this printing issue."
4,"Zondervan NIV Study Bible, large print","I bought this bible for a pastor in Indiana, who has pastored for 51 years and due to health issues involving his sight the large print was important. I looked at the book, while not new, it was in good shape when it came. There were underlined passages but I myself do that in my bible and did not destroy the value.I can always find a bargain on Amazon and use it for my Kindle ereader. If you buy an updated ereader, such as I did for the pastor (Kindle Fire) it not only downloaded the NIV study bible in print but transferred every book I had ever purchased and quickly.The Pastor notified me that he can read the Kindle Fire print and an 8 track preacher in an ipod world is now in the 20th century ereader world. What a miracle for him and a pleasure for me to be able to do that with God's help and using Amazon as my provider for this miracle."
4,Study Bible,"This NIV Study Bible is great. With the notes at the bottom of each page, you can learn even more. Easier to read and understand that the other bibles I have. It is heavy, though, so that is why I purchased the same bible but in paperback."
5,This is the Book to buy.,I bought this book for a new Christian friend. It has LARGE print which is very easy to read. The notes at the bottom are excellent. I've read my Book all the way through 3 times now. Started on my 4th reading and I was never really a reader. This Book is the best. Recommended this Book highly. It will give you life long Blessings.
5,I love this Bible,I love this Bible because the text is very readable and it doesn't stress my eyes too much. Because of this large text.. it's really huge and thick and heavy.. so it's uncomfortable reading it lying down(but obviously it's not a good idea to read it lying down).. I still like it.. lot's of explanations and extra notes.
4,Sakamoto,"This movie has sat in my netflix half as long as I've owned the score. I've never actually watched it. If you know anything about Sakamoto's scores you know that they're usually sweet but not sickening, and it is his synthesis that usually brings depth to his work. This score removes the sweetness and focuses on his more textured sound design elements. It's a long walk from his Merry Christmas, Mr Lawrence scores in that right, but technology has changed and so has the work of most electronic composers. It's a good score, some moments better than others. I'm a fan of his scores. If you listen to Last Emperor (I hate to bring that one up as it is his most popular) you can really hear how Sakamoto has a knack for juxtaposing abstract and alienating textures onto sweeter, more elegant chamber pieces. This is that aesthetic unbalanced, focusing more on an isolating sound."
2,Between mystical moods and pain,"A score that reproduce the somewhat akward feeling that creeped up to me, watching the movie. Mr. Sakamoto gives the listener a mixture of mysterious moods en pain. Although interesting for the fan of mr. Sakamoto's music, is the score surely not his best one."
5,Sheer and utter beauty,"As I always state, I am a Purcell worshipper. His harmonies, counterpoint, and text underlay are absolutely unique and wonderful. I second what was said in another review. Get the complete work if you can. However, this highlights disk is awfully fine listening.Track 4 ""Come if You Dare"" is stunning in its energy and fun. It is almost unfair to single out any track because the excitement is everywhere in this performance.Track 6 ""How Blest Are Shepherds"" is especially nice Purcell style lyric beauty.Well, I could say something nice about every track. The point is - this is a treasure and should be in your collection (but go for the complete version of this same performance if you can)."
3,Power reserve issue,The watch is a brand new one. But It does not reserve enough power to run more than 12 hours.
1,Misleading Title,"I really like Robert Glass's computer books of which I've read several, but despite the title, this is NOT a computer book. This is a compilation of news reports of dot-com BUSINESS failures. There is nothing about computers in the book, except that the businesses used them. The blurb on the back of the book talks about ""why software projects fail"" but there is virtually nothing in the book on projects or software. Also the format is useful for illustrating ideas (for a good example see Epstein's The Case of the Killer Robot) but here there is nothing for them to illustrate - this is nothing but news reports.I was expecting something more like Neumann's Computer-Related Risks."
5,Burial Grounds,A story about killing grounds of the Jews ordered by hitler & his killingmachines. I don' know how anyone could survive this kind of torture.God bless all of them that survived so they could tell the world about allof this killing that was kept a secret from the rest of the world. We need to know aboutall of this so we can make sure the world knows about it.
5,I finished it in two days!,"Horrific. The inserts by the author himself, in his own words, add a wonderful touch to a completely true story that will shock and move you. I couldn't put the book down. It is an absorbing tale about a young boy forced to suffer unbelievable knowledge of horrors and to live amidst these horrors, all the while trying to grow up. The author's description of the hunger experienced by himself (he is the young boy the story is about) is graphic and poignant. I doubt I will ever be completely free of the memory of this story. Many thanks to the author for a truly memorable experience - I highly recommend this book, but not for the squeamish."
4,bought a book,The book Babi Yar was in great condition and I was very happy with the price and delivery time
5,Excellent book. Definitely worth finding.,"Imagine living next door to a death camp. Babi Yarwas one of the death camps used by the Nazi's in WWII. A.Anatoli's book about ""Babi Yar"" is the recolection of ayoung youth who not only had the horrible experience ofliving by this camp but he was a member of the hated racethat was meant to die. He was a Jew.If you are interested in reading a book that is wellwritten and gives an in-depth insightful look at one of themost violent times in our history then this is the book foryou. ""Babi Yar"" tells the tale of a young boy who was tryingto grow up into a young Jewish man during a time where hisrace was being eradicated."
5,Great product!,We use these tablets often. my husband gets frequent ear aches and he uses these for a couple days and the ear aches go away. They are homeopathic too which makes me feel better about the tabs too.
4,"I'm not sure, but.....","I'm not sure, but I think that this is an entirely original live concert! It's got later renditions of classic songs, around the Sexual Healing era, with wonderful versions of Let's Get it On, Ain't Nothing Like The Real Thing, and What's Going On. James Brown's set might also be original, I'm not sure, but I don't like it as much as an album like live at the appollo...still, it's a great album, and I'm glad it's live instead of rehashed studio recordings. 5 for Marvin, 3 for James....4 stars."
5,good idea for a game but a little confusing,"overall a pretty good game and an interesting idea, but can be a bit confusing"
5,Still going,Its Yu Yu Hakusho if you don't like it then turn the page. Great series well written filled with suspense. Leaves you waiting to see what happens next.
5,Very Cool,"I'm not a concert film guy, but this is still one of the coolest things that I've ever seen. A potential culture clash that comes together in a a wonderful display of empathy and mutual respect ...with some great music to bind it together. I've always liked eastern-euro roken-roll (Red Elvises et al)so this was really up my alley. I firmly believe every 10th person should have a copy."
3,The dog likes 'em,"The cat is contrary. Loved these until the case was bought. Now he turns up his nose. Cats,gotta love 'em,can't kill them..."
5,Fantastic sleep time music,"Not only does our baby love this music, but it is beautiful for us adults to listen to as well. There are 24 tunes, all strictly instumental except the last one. It runs over an hour and does not have any major ""loud spots"" despite a very nice variety of music.Highly recommended!!!"
5,montblac meisterstuck 164,"I purchased this pen for my daughter, who was recently promoted to Provising Manager for a large communications firm. I have owned a Montblac for many years and my daughter always commented how dad never leaves home without his pen. I wanted to impress upon her how proud I was of her accomplishment, so over lunch, I surprised her by offering her my own Mont Blanc (Solitaire Doue Signum) she said there was no way she could take my pen because she knew how much i liked it. So i reached into my coat pocket and said ""I knew you would say that, so i got you something, and I hope you like it"" It was the Montblanc Meistertuck Burgundy 164 and a very nice journal. BIG Hit!! I made her cry in public (very hard to do!). It was a major bonding event!! she will treasure her new Burgandy montblanc for many years, but she will treasure my method of presentation even more...........a happy fatherP.S. I did not talk about the pen much because....a Montblanc is a Montblanc!"
3,Pleasant Sound and Vibe,"When a band has been around for 18 years, did the major label thing, been dropped, and continues to record on their own boutique label, that's commitment. The Ocean Blue have withstood one change in its lineup (the dismissal of keyboardist Steve Lau; he claims homophobia, the band vehemently denies it) with no discernible change to their fragile indie-rock. Their latest EP, Waterworks, is more of the same, though these five tunes (and one instrumental) are both feyer and catchier than ever. David Schitzel's Pennsylvania quartet will never be stars - that time has passed them by - but they've been remarkably consistent and engaging. Their biggest charm is their pleasant sound and vibe (""The Northern Jetstream"" is all arpeggios and chants of ""doot doo doo""). It's also their biggest weakness."
2,Disappointing,"As a long time fan of Ocean Blue's previous albums Cerulean and Beneath the Rythm and Sound this album was a complete let down. The basic sound is there but song writing, and singing, is lacking. Out of six tracks on this album I found only two, Ticket to Wyoming and The Northern Jetstream, to have and redeeming qualities. I really can't imagine how anyone who likes the band's earlier works would appreciate this album..."
4,The Blue still has it!,"2007 version of The Ocean Blue is very familiar. Not much has changed and that my friends is a good thing! Sounding more like the Smiths on this album (if that's possible) they create a toe tapping good time. Track 5 ""Sunshower"" has become my new fav. Do yourself a favor and pick this up to complete your collection. I only gave it four stars due to the fact it is so very short but hay, a little Ocean Blue is better than none at all."
1,horrible product!,"On Amazon's description this Pot is rated at 1600watts, but on the box its says 1000watts! If i knew it was 1000watts I wouldn't have gotten it. First time I turn it on 5 mins later I smell burning plastic & it smoked, but that did go away. Plus if you intend to use this as a hotpot do not get it. It took me over an hour to get the water fill 3 quarters way to boil with the lid closed. Once take the lid is removed it doesn't get bubbles, and the auto on/off sensor is already turning itself off. Not to mention putting cold food into it. I ended up removing the pot and placing it on my stove for the rest of the meal."
2,Need to improve the thermocontrol,"The product arrived in good condition, and it looked in good quality upon opening. Then we tried a hotpot feast with it, and we had almost same experience as the one of the reviewers- it took forever to heat up the food in the pot to the boiling point. But we spent some time on it and discovered, Yeah!, that it is not the power of the device, but the auto-control of it that caused the problem. Somehow the power went off prematurely, so the heating was delayed. So I think the manufacturer should look into this and improve its mechanism.I am looking forward to response from the seller and amazon for this- hoping for a replacement, when a better unit is there."
3,Fashionable light bulbs,"These bulbs look great when they're lit up, but not so good otherwise when they tend to look like they have a film on them. They do give a nice glow when lit, but I don't think I'd buy them again."
3,Nice but pricey,This is an adorable book but probably not worth the money. I like the look of it but my baby has yet to be mesmerized by either side of if (had from 3-5months of age). It's also very bulky and difficult to fold up or to bend into the accordion shape you want (unlike a board book version). I would suggest Tana Hoben's Black & White accordion book for kids under 6months - this has been a much bigger hit for us and folds up compactly and can be set up fairly straight out or bent into different shapes depending on the space you have.
5,entertaining,My four month old gets tummy time every day with this in his view. The pictures on both sides entertain him for quite a while. I highly recommend it.
3,ok but not great,"The picture on this looks so cute, but when it comes in the mail it's folded all weird and it's way too stiff to straighten it out. It's not folded like the picture, and it's almost impossible to fold that way without serious effort. I ended up unfolding it as flat as I could and tying it to the outside of the crib toward the bottom so my 4 month old could look up at it during tummy time. One side is blue, white, black, and red - the other side is totally different with greens and oranges etc. - I don't like the other side."
3,not a favorite,"I am not at all impressed with this book/toy. First of all the color is NOT red. It is a mauve color. Second off. My son has shown absolutely no interest in it all. He doesn't find the pictures interesting and the ""mirror"" is a joke! It looks like a funhouse mirror!"
2,"Good, but not the BEST!","Easy to follow recipes, but lacks the insight of other books, such as Dana Carpenter's book on low carb cooking."
3,gift,"This book was given as a gift , so I have not gotten any resipes out of it book in excellent condition"
2,"Hey whinos, this is the book for you!","I thought this would be a great cookbook, since it's titled ""low carb"" ... and while some of the recipes are indeed low-carb, nearly every single page calls for some sort of alcohol. I don't know if the authors intended to create a ""Drunks Cookbook"" but that's exactly what they did. Most of the recipes are double the amount of carbs they should be, and then adding ""sherry, beer, whiskey"" or some other random alcohol on top makes it high carb, and then you're turning your children into drunks just by cooking. Good idea, failed execution."
2,Mediocre recipes - one for the garage sale,"I recently adopted a low-carb eating lifestyle and am also very dependent on my Slow-cooker. Unfortunately, the recipes in this book are mediocre at best. Many of the recipes are salty and rely on salty ingredients (i.e. soup mixes, bouillon cubes). Other recipes I've tried are too watery and may have been poorly adapted from regular recipes. Finally, there is not enough nutritional information in these recipes. I'd like to see not only ""Net carbs"", but total carbs, fiber, salt, fat, etc. This one is being sold at my next garage sale."
1,Waste of money,"I agree with other reviewers who have addressed that the recipes are mediocre at best, so no need to go into detail on that point. Two other things I really didn't like about this book: 1) The nutritional information lists net carbs. I need to know total carbs, so using recipes with the nutritional information provided for convenience is impossible with this book. 2) There are dozens of recipes that are not slow-cooker recipes. I don't begrudge a few, but in a cookbook devoted to the slow-cooker, I don't want to see recipes that require only a skillet!"
1,Think before you buy...,"Ok, so I thought I was really onto something here, slow cooker and low carb! What more could a busy mom of two ask for? Well, how about a good cook book? At first glance it seems like it will hit the spot, but every recipe was either too salty (what do you expect when most recipes call for beeth broth or chicken stock plus salt?) or came out looking like off white sludge? Anyway, me and my family did not like one single recipe in here. I am more than a little disappointed. And yes, I did follow the recipes exactly and did not substitue.Better luck with another book."
2,Needs pictures,This a good book but I think it needed pictures but maybe it is a personal preference but to me a cook book needs pictures.Other than that the recipes sometimes require too many ingridients.
2,"If you're a serious low-carber, pass this book up.","This book is certainly a lowered carb cookbook, but many of the single servings approach my carb limit for the entire day. Also, before you buy this book you should be aware that most of the recipes call for some carb-questionable ingredients such as white flour, molasses, orange juice, tapioca, canned soups, chickpeas, kidney beans, white beans, lentils, quinoa, canned creamed corn, grape jelly and the like. I was disappointed. I was looking for truly low carb foods, but there are few recipes in this book that I would use, and the ones I have tried were unexciting and bland."
1,BIG waste of money and ingredients,"I was really excited to buy this book and try out some healthier low carb recipes in my new crock pot. Once I got the book and flipped through it I realized that most of the recipes required ingredients that I don't commonly have at home. I couldn't make a single thing in it till I went grocery shopping and stocked up on some expensive spices, tapioca, chicken broth, beef broth, cooking wines, fresh rosmary, etc. So I buy all this stuff only to find that the recipes are a shade beneath mediocre. I tried to like them, I wanted to like them but I couldn't develope an affinity for a single thing out of this book. The whole purpose behind going crock for me was to save time and money but LOTS of food and ingredients went to waste attempting these recipes. I'm not a cook, I'm a scientist. Cooking creativity is not in my arsenal so I followed every recipe to the letter. I can't recommend this book."
2,Recipes,Not anything that you can't find on the internet. Wasted my money... wish I had just done a recipe internet search. Just thought it would be nice to have the recipes on my kindle. Nothing special.
2,Disappointed Cook,"I was very disappointed in this book. When scanning the recipes, I found very few that I could just go to my pantry and make. Many recipes called for ingredients that I never heard of or never purchased in 50 years of cooking."
1,What grilled chicken?,The cover of this book shows a delicious grilled chicken recipe. But it's a slow cooker cookbook. Nowhere in the book does it give the recipe noting the cover image. I ordered the book based on that. Very disappointed.
3,Good Book,"This is a good book to give you meal ideas. If you're looking for healthy cooking, however, you'll need to make modifications as many of these recipes call for very fatty, unhealthy ingredients. You will also need to be ready to prepare veggies as sides. I was hoping the recipes would include the veggies, but these main dishes are mostly just meat.Still the recipes I have tried are good and easy."
4,Great ideas,Have already tried several recipes from this book and enjoyed them all. The LC chili recipe is the best I've had!
1,"Timing suspect, eight hours for meatloaf!","I bought this due to changing lifestyes and looking for something different to have that's still low-carb. I tried the classic meatloaf recipe which calls for cooking at low for 8 hours. I was in and out and noticed that it smelled done after4 hours but thought I'd follow the recipe. I finally turned it off after seven hours and then had to toss it out, burnt on bottom and both sides. Are these recipes tested? I was usinga brand new crock pot of the size recommended in the book (5 qt)and the style (removable crock) recommended. I'm hesitant about trying anything else but will certainly not ever make anything and leave the house."
1,Need more than net carb ratings,"Though I am sure the recipes taste wonderful, the carb information is given only as net carbs. People such as diabetics, who truly need to know the count of what they eat, must have the whole carbohydrate count. Relying on net carb numbers only can be dangerous to those who need an accurate count of how many carbs they can eat. Take a look at the numbers on packaged foods, total vs net carbs. Also, temperatures of crock pots vary widely. It would be helpful if the temperature ranges would have been listed, with suggestions for adjusting the recipes accordingly."
1,Warning: SanDisk 4GB SD card being sold here is a FAKE!,"I just received my SanDisk 4GB SD card today in the mail and it is a FAKE!From the moment I got it I knew something was wrong because the packaging looked cheap and even the SD card itself didn't look like my other SanDisk 1GB card that I purchased from a retail store. Also, my 4GB card had no serial# on the back and when I tried it in my Treo 700P phone it had problems reading it. Then I checked the card using special software and it showed the manufacturer as Lexar!Beware of fake cards on ebay and other online sellers that claim the cards are SanDisk. You better be sure that you are getting the real thing. After this experience I will only buy these cards from retail stores.If you want to spot a fake read this: martybugs.net/articles/fakesandisk.cgi"
3,"Don't bother: nothing new, even for the ultimate Royals fan","Really no new info here. Stick with Dimbelby account, even if Charles himself regrets having participated in its production. Far too little about life without Diana; the author may have moved out of Charles's circle by the time of the Paris accident, and his information seems decidedly second-hand. For revelations, however tawdry and perhaps even untrue, save up for Penny Junor's new tome."
2,Don't buy this book; you've heard it all before.,"I was extremely disappointed with ""Charles at Fifty"" for three reasons. First, the title is grossly misleading. It implies that most or all of the book will examine the Prince of Wales as he is today (i.e., how he's handling Diana's death; his relationship with his sons and Camilla, his parents, etc.) Instead, almost all of it is a biography of Charles, going back all 50 years. Relatively little focuses on Charles after the divorce. Second, there's very little here that we've not already seen or heard somewhere else. (Readers are forced to sit through yet another rehashing of the Waleses' maital woes.) Third, the book is terribly one-sided. Diana is portrayed as the innocent victim of a cold, heartless, selfish man who used her. Little effort is made at telling his side of the story. Far superior to Holden's book is Penny Junor's ""Charles: Villian or Victim;"" however, be warned that Junor is VERY pro-Charles."
2,Its a sad commentary on Mr. Holden when an American has more,"respect for his counrty's monarchy than he does.I enjoyed reading parts of this biography, however, it does not put His Royal Highness in a good light. That is truely a shame since the PoW has no real peers. How can Mr. Holden judge Prince Charles so harshly, when the closest peer he has is HRH Prince Felipe Of Spain or some other heir to a throne? Besides that, he is heir to the throne by divine right, not public opinion. He should be shown respect at all times. On the other hand, I was LOL at some parts of it because it seems that the PoW does not have any common sense.The chapter(s) on Charles' love for achitecture is downright BORING! And Poundbury? What was that? That chapter went over my head.One more thing, does the author know how to write about BOTH sides of the story?"
3,"Great songs, mediocre sound.","I must qualify this 3 star rating immediately! This is a Marc Almond album, which means it gets 5 stars for song writing, showmanship, arrangement, and all-around fun. Unfortunately, this is also a live album with sub-standard sound. This is the *only* reason I can see to justify complaint. But it is a good one.""Live in Concert"" presents a nice cross-section of Mr. Almond's work up to 1987, and there is a lot of energy in his performance. The sound quality I would place somewhere in the vicinity of an excellent audience bootleg. The fact that it is a soundboard recording only becomes evident when the volume changes subtly, but inexplicably.I'd say this is an indispensable recording for any Marc Almond fan, but it will not make a good introduction for the newcomer."
4,Good for beginners.,"For teachers looking for something between a comprehensive collection of the dialogues and a photocopied hand-out, this little edition nicely fits the bill. It's an extremely user-friendly translation with a generous introduction and copious but clear and concise endnotes. The editor admittedly errors on the side of verbosity in the introduction, going to excessive (not to mention gratuitous) lengths to argue that the ""Crito"" is not inconsistent with the ""Apology."" Also, rather than substituting ""defense"" for ""apology"" and "" goodness"" for ""virtue,"" he might have accomplished the goal of a clear and accessible edition by giving the reader a bit more credit. Finally, many instructors and readers would understandably be forgiven if they shunned this edition because of its omission of the ""Phaedo,"" the final chapter in the trial, sentencing, and punishment of Socrates."
2,I never got my book.,I ordered this book almost a month ago. I was pretty excited about this book and it never came. It's still not here. I need it for my philosophy class. I don't know if I will order anything from this person again.
4,COmplete Swimming Pool Reference,"Although I found the book to be somewhat outdated, it is clear and consise and easy to read. I am not a pool ""expert"" as some of the reviewers are, I am new to the pool business and in that regard i found it very helpful.Remember, this is a refence book published a while ago and pool ""standards"" continue to change."
3,"Nice, this is the book of 'The Complete Reference....'","We found excellent information about Swimming pool design and various topics related about maintaining the pool.And i request you common to those who have the information about ""Which is the biggest Swimming Pool that ever made so far, and its complete specification, total estimation..etc?"".Kindly mail to meif you have answer with you...- Al zahrani Jaber"
4,Nice Gravy Boat,"This is a nice looking, but more importantly, a sizable gravy boat that can be put in the microwave on warm to heat up the gravy before use. It looks more expensive than it is and I'm already thinking of getting another for a possible Christmas gift."
5,Wonderous,"Thanks to this costume, my baby now poops pizza and has advanced in intellect roughly three years ahead of his time. Thanks Obama."
2,The product simply is not right,"The product comes just like the picture, but it is not going to work with a 1996 volvo 850 sedan. Just doesn't work."
5,Very nice!,This looked really nice in my window bright colors the lights don't blink though. It's so easy to hang and it stays put. Highly recommend!
3,One of the brightest ones.,I liked this candy cane the best of the three I bought. It really showed well in the window. I would recommend this to a friend.
3,Design Issues,"The Kodak Telephoto Lens Kit for DX Series Digital Cameras works well in the sense that it produces clear pictures. The DX 7630 Camera design presents an annoying problem. With the lens adapter and lens attached, the scene in the view finder is partially obscured. The view is also partially obscured with just the lens adapter attached. That won't be a problem if you always use the digital display screen to compose your pictures. However, outside in bright light the display screen is often difficult to use. Then, when you are most likely to use a telephoto lens, you have to rely on the view finder."
4,Telephoto Lens Kit,This product is exactly as advertised and well worth the money. The additional range opens many more possibilities when shooting photographs. Buying the kit makes things nicer since it includes the adapter and a lens case/bag.
2,Not good if you need to widen your range,"If you are trying to use this lens for objects that you need to zoom in and zoom out on, don't buy it unless you are fast enough to take off the lens when the object is near you.. Why? Because your pictures will look like you have taken them in a tunnel...The zoom isn't that great anyway!"
4,Theme from a great movie,"This is a weird thing to write about in a review but I was hunting around for any info on my Dad's movies that I thought had faded off into oblivion, and up comes the theme song for ""Any Number Can Win."" My Dad was writing under the pen name of John Trinian, he also wrote another great movie ( filmed in San Francisco in 1965) with really good music. He wrote ""Once a Thief"" under the name, Zekial Marko. The score was written by Lalo Shifrin, another awesome composer. Both these movies are pulp fiction crime dramas written in true beatnik style with hep-talkin-jive speak. The music is so ahead of it's time in both films and captures the times so well! Thank God for computers to help locate all this obscure stuff!Belle Marko"
4,This is going to be fun!,"I have just started playing this game over the weekend. After some initial crashes (due to my not having the latest video drivers) the game has ran VERY well. No crashes, no real lag. This game will be a tremendous amount of fun as I play it more. I am very busy and have found that even if you only get to play for a hour or two, you can still advance your character and have fun. You don't need to play for six hours at a time. This can make it fun even for the casual gamer."
4,MMORPG fetal stage,"Many people have been giving this game bad reveiwes becuase of technical problems, but what we all need to remember is that these are typically due to client side issues. I have been playing quite often and I have had few if any problems. I'm running a P- Celeron at 466 with a voodoo 3 card 16mb of mem. and 256 ram, I have some of the rendering options turned off, and I have had very few problems. Something a lot of people are not realizing is that this genre is in the relative fetal stage and that open beta cannot predict the problems of 1000 logged on users. The game has a great detting as well as good game play, and for those of us who are sick of the fantasy RPG, it is a refreshing twist. I urge people to try this game, at the very least, give it a shot and if you keep bombing out, then go from there."
1,Perfect Example of a Poor Game Launch,"Shame on Funcom for ruining so many players first impressions of a brand new online game. Shame on Funcom for not learning anything from past mistakes. Shame on Funcom for promising so much and delivering so litte.Since AO's launch 2 days ago, the game has been nothing but problems for the majority of the people who have tried it. Funcom promises fixes, promises improvements... but beta testers have received these same promises since day one. Many of the bugs that currently infest this game were known about in the beta, reported, and then promptly ignored. Shame on Funcom."
2,"Great Potential, Bad Execution","It's really a game that *could* have been fun if it delivered everything you'd expect, but dependance on missions, lack of areas to hunt with friends or groups outside of towns with little to no knowledge beforehand, and a myriad of errors and screen lag soon suck the fun out of it after 20 lvls."
4,A rough start but getting better.,"The first week or so of Anarchy Online was pretty rough. Servers going down, patches and lag. All the standard stuff we've come to expect when a game of this nature launches. Funcom has made amazing progress in a week. As I type this, my wife is playing the game, as she has been all day. A few disconnects but otherwise it's fully playable. And what a fun game to play it is! I quit playing Everquest over a month ago, I got bored with the constant camping, begging for groups and corpse runs. AO has eliminated these annoyances with a very unique mission system. The graphics are amazing, much better than the screens for the upcoming Shadows of Luclin. The fighting system is lots of fun and best of all NO CAMPING! I think this game will hold my interest for quite a while. (The downside is my wife may never let me play again, she's already told me to cancel her EQ account!)"
4,I Really Enjoy This Breath of Fresh Air,"The first few months were rough and there was one questionable patch introduced since release, but other than that the game works quite well for me. There is plenty of gorgeous scenery and lots of places to visit. The story line will start soon and some much needed content will be introduced. I enjoy the character development as well as the Quality Level system for Weapons and Armor. Weapons and armor have requiments on them which keeps powerful items out of the hands of lower levels. Well done Funcom!"
3,Wait for now,"AO has very nice potential, unfortunately it is not now! I'm running a Pent 850, with 256 RAM, a Geforce3 with 64 (which I've had to turn down to near nothing), and cable modem..and for a great deal of the time this game is just not very playable. The game has much potential, it has beautiful graphics, the mission generators are very nice, and when it works for any length of time is a joy to play. Of the downsides, it's buggy, the maxium requirments should instead be listed as the minimum, it's laggy and the instruction booklet is a real joke. I am still sticking with the game for now, I realize that problems will be worked out, but if you looking to buy, my advice to you right now is wait."
1,bugginess online,"anarchy online,the buggiest game ever released to the public.I wish i could say it works because the concept is awesome,but the game flat out DOESN'T work.Now,as the Euro release happens,they wiped their message boards so no Euro's can see all the problems in the game.a definate not buy"
1,Do NOT buy this game!,"In short, it is buggy, at times unstable, and it's creator, Funcom, keeps DRASTICALLY altering game balance such that it is impossible to tell what your chartacter(s) may be capable of doing with regard to combat, bith PvP and PvM, from patch to patch!It is not worth the money or the frustration!"
1,A GAME THAT PROMISED TO BE THE KING BUT IS NOT EVEN CLOSE,"First i would refer anyone to go to the offical web site forums and read the posts.as for the game i wish to note that it has dropped in less then 3 months to half the price which i have never seen happen to any of the other mmrpg in the market.the game lacks online support,is very buggy,still laggy and after a few levels there is nothing to do in this game.the game is suffering massive loss of subscribers and been a mmrpg it was hard for me to even bother to stay on itas i se the game folding fast.they are hoping a lot on its european release to save the game and for a game that was the most awaited game in the market this is sad.the game basically was very overhyped and only a few ever knew about the gameplay of it and most people lived in what was promised.sadly on release it have shown total lack of potential."
1,"This game is unfun, unstable, and over priced","I signed on from day one of retail and it has been downhill ever since. This game is even buggier than when it was first released, if you can believe that! They have absolutely no customer service. Emails and in game help requests go unanswered. Aside from the pretty graphics and if you can get it running long enough before crashing, you soon discover the game inside is very shallow. The mission generator makes the same boring missions except you have different wall textures. Game balance doesn't exist and they're still constantly nerfing character classes. ..."
2,"Been there, did that, never got a T-shirt","Hmmmmm, where to start?I signed up right after release (better known as the Beta-5 phase to those who played it) and stuck with it for a couple months. Got my character up to 60, so I played it quite a bit; joined a new guild, had my friends who always played....And just got so sick of entering missions, not knowing what had been completely ""nerfed"" in the last patch. One day I go into a mission, green monsters are easy; next day I do the same level mission and get my a** kicked. So playability, while varied and in a sci-fi atmosphere (hella-cool, why hasn't it been done before?) is completely variable from one day to the next.Three weeks later I visit the main message board, and it's the same as when I left... a recent patch has pissed off 3/4 of the game's population...Final analysis: Wait for the spin-off, hopefully done by a company who has their act together a little more.SandarAkA Bloodsnatch LVL 60 ADV (now deceased :("
1,Waste of time and money,"I would have given it a zero, but there is a minimum of one star. I am very surprised that this game has made it to the US market, as I am sure it violates a very large number of fraud, false advertising and consumer protection laws."
3,Anarchy OFFLNIE,"To start this off let me say that in no way am I a basher of AO or Funcom. This game has such great potential it is bursting out of its seems! ... You get into this GIGANTIC world and you are literatly amazed at the size of everything! Not only that but the graphics are just incredible for this game thus I reccomend a higher-end system because sometimes in the cities your Frame Rate can drop to as low as 8.5/sec! The emotes are plentiful and run VERY smooth, some are even down right hilarious! For example, typing /moon will make your charector appear like he is dropping his pants and mooning you. Or another is /ymca where he will literatly break out into dancing the YMCA! If this game currently did not have the bugs it did I would have easily gave it 5 stars but because of these bugs I had to drop it down a little.Once Funcom works out all the tinks the game will work great and will easily become the next big contender in the world of MMPORPGs!"
1,Bugarchy Offline,"Give me a break! More bugs than pixels on my monitor, the free month has taken effect and it's still not very playable, no way to cancel account because the control panel isn't working, the list keeps growing but for now I need to go return this game before I vomit in disgust. SO MANY CHARACTERS ARE STILL STUCK IN ZONES! BTW, the retail version was actually the final beta version. Thanks Funcom for charging the public [price] to test the game. Maybe we can actually play it in 6 months."
1,"I have played UO, EQ and AC...AO is the worst game ever.","AO has manage to go backwards instead of forwards. Buggy...no support...nobody monitoring the boards. Just the other day they claim they accidently erased the Message boards..bull! There are so many negative comments on those boards, they had to erase them, altho if you go there now...its full again of negative comments. Don't buy or try this game. If you want to try a game that looks decent and has people who seem to care about the game...try DAoC (Dark Age of Camelot) [....]STAY AWAY FROM ANARCHY-ONLINE!!!!"
1,The worst ... I ever spent..DON'T BUY ANARCHY ONLINE!!,"I really tried to give this game a chance. I did the Beta (which this game is still in) and it is still in beta almost a month after its release. FUNCOM (or as most people call them NotSoFUNCOM) has got to be one of the most disorganized companies I have ever seen. It took them almost a week to get their secure website up so that you could use your credit card to activate the game. The customer support is almost nonexistant and they only do it through email, they have said they will not be having phone help. The graphics are nice, but other than that the game(if you can play) is really kinda boring. Even when you go way out from the cities there is not much to do. I would save your money and wait for something better. On 7/19/01 they just lost the saves of characters and they had to reset to a previous saved character, which means you lost most of you items and lots of XPs. SAVE YOUR MONEY!! DON'T BUY ANARCHY ONLINE"
1,"Good game, but wait....","Anarchy Online is a very fun game.... when its working. The problem is, since it went live on the 27th of June, that almost nobody can stay connected for more than a short while.Those that can, for whatever reason (and its a small number) have leveled like the wind and are way ahead of the curve.I recommend you wait a few weeks, and check for reviews from people who have actually played the game. I got my copy the day before the game went live, and I'm trying to think of a reason not to return it for nonfunctionality.If the packet loss and connectivity problems are solved, the game will merit 4 or 5 stars. Its fun, innovative, has good graphics, excellant world design, good AI for the monsters, and even a real sense of humor. Funny when a newbie area monster (""Leet"") is attacked and says, ""I'LL GET MY MAIN!"" and so forth.So just wait a few weeks, then see. If the technical problems are resolved, its a must buy."
1,Buyer Beware,"Please be advised! Many of these games are shipping with CD keys that are invalid. To add insult to injury, Funcoms customer service is close to non-existant and it could take several weeks and access to a fax machine to resolve your problem. The official message boards are flooded with complaints and there hasn't been a single post from Funcom to give any help or advice or even the slightest whiff of anything resembling an appology for what is an absolutely stupid and totally avoidable mistake"
1,unable to play,"So far noone in the family has been able to review this game because it doesn't run on any system we have and registration doesn't recognize the code key. I waited several months after purchase for this game and never a mention of monthly fee to play. I am a Tribes and Tribes2 fan and expect bugs at initial release. So far no response to Email and no phone number listed to contact just to get another key code. Double BOOOOO so far on this long-awaited expensive, monthly fee game experience.LindaAddendum- I should have mentioned using PentiumIII1000 256 and GforceII. This is not the problem. Two weeks after emailing Tech support I received 2 generic computer generated response and no code key or any response that acknowleges that they read my email. Since this is such a common problem a separate customer support area could route these registration questions."
1,Don't buy it for a couple of months!,"This is a nice game, but the support is terrible, the gameplay is horrid, the server performance will drive you crazy. I think that Funcom really screwed up with this one and are working very hard to avoid the lawsuits that are probably coming. This game in its current state should never have been released. Bottom line, don't buy it for a couple of months. If you do, you WILL be sorry you did."
1,No Fun!,"What had the potential to be one of the greatest online games has since it's very shaky launch gone steadily if not downhill, somewhat sideways. They fix one problem and make two more in the precess. This game still has so many bugs, gameplay faults and class imbalances, two months after launch that I cannot recommend even trying to play it. I say the pefect MMORPG is yet to be created. My money is on Blizzard and WOW. If you can't wait for that, be very wary of jumping right in at launch. You WILL end up being a paid bug finder."
2,Extremely boring and buggy,I was pretty excited about this game when I bought it and the first few weeks were fun but it quickly becomes repetative. The crashes and other problems are also very annoying.
1,its junk,Never have I played a game with such promise and with such poor execution.Funcom's billing is horrendous - there's a good chance you will end up with all sorts of charges.There is no support whatsoever. Email support and you may be lucky enough to get back an automated message a week later.They have virtually no testing/QA. Recently they released a patch ON A FRIDAY which resulted in invulnerable mobs and a huge increase of mob vs pc power.It's [junk]. Find something else.-Brian
1,P.O.S.,This game is bugged horribly.It lags terribly.There is a memory leak.Classes are unbalanced.Monster fights are boring.PvP is boring.The game was ruined by incontinent nerfs.It sucks.Do not buy.
2,Save your money,Ok for starters the game is graphically beautiful. Basically you have a list of professions you can chose from. You pick one..start playing it and just when you are really enjoying it..Funcom changes it or breaks something and you have to wait until the next patch. Basically you are paying to play a BETA product hands down with little to no input. Save the money and play something that was tested.
1,This is an awful game,"I've played EQ for 2 1/2 years and was really looking forward to AO. Well, I'll be blunt - it stinks. The world is hugh - and empty. The missions are unique - but really all the same. The FPS in the cities is literally below one per second."
1,This game is not a game.,"This game truly blows. It blew when it was in beta, it blew when it was released and it blows now. You can do better than this. Buy anything else, or better yet, invest your money in the depleted stock market. Even if you lost your money in the market, you'd do better than to give it to Funcom. You can always play solitaire. It is far more enjoyable. There is a reason this game has dropped more than half of it's retail price in the three months it has been out."
1,Anarchy OFFline by NotFuncom,"If you value your time and money STAY AWAY from this ""game"". This game is still in beta development (some would say alpha). The amount of bugs in the program is currently over 1,000 and seems to continue to grow with every failed patch that the developers franticly apply. The developers DO NOT listen to their community and the amount of anger felt toward them can be seen on any of the few remaining fan sites on the net. It short, this game only gets one star because it is not possible to give anything else lower. What a waste of time [...]. AVOID! AVOID! AVOID!"
1,"Bad, Very Bad Game!","*BEWARE the ""FanBoi"" 5-star reviews at the top, they know not of what they speak and are just trying to spam the review system.Ok, I'll say something nice first - nice graphic engine, things do look pretty.Now the bad:1) Crash, crash, crash (may users can't play the game longer than 10 minutes)2) FunCom has the worst Customer Support I've ever seen, makes Verant (EverQuest) look good in comparison.3) Game Bugs abound. Not just common, but PROLIFIC! Some are so bad that they can be exploited, others make the game virtually unplayable with any enjoyment. The updates seem to add as many bugs as are fixed.There are more but why bother - folks are leaving this game in DROVES. You are paying NOW for a Beta game that won't be enjoyable for a minimum of 6 months... save your money for Dark Age of Camelot!"
4,Anarchy Online !!,"This is the best MMORPG to date..Gorgeous graphichs that makes your characther almost smell the grass and the air he breaths,Alas FunCom have had a rough start bugs bugs and countless patching and creating some new ones when patches beeing released. They also had numerous of people that think exploiting is ok and when they get stopped they tend to get angry thus spreding ill rumors about this wonderful game !!But at todays date they have ruled out almost all bugs and the game is stable as any other,,They also managed to catch the worst exploits,,FunCom has really done an impressive work with the game since beta, working both night and day !!This is an absolute winner MMORPGNote: The only sad part is that you really need a monster machine to run this game at full beaty..atlest 600Mhz and 512 RAM and a powerful graphics card,,If you have this mascine you will have a blast,,else stay away until you uppgraded"
4,"Great game, just a bit buggy","As of 7/10/01 most of the major crash/lag bugs have been fixed, you can play for hours with not too much incident. You will still occasionally lag out, crash, and not be able to zone. But it is playable and a ton of fun.The game itself is an evolution of the MMORPG. There is little downtime, every class is powerful, no one is a useless xp sucking gimp, the world is beautiful, huge variety of items, well balanced, etc etc. Very well done in that sense and stands taller than EverQuest et al here.Awesome, cool game with a lot of great concepts. Just a few bugs left to work out, but a tremendous amount of them have been fixed. Really not too different from any other online game out there... EQ/UO had a ton of problems when they were released too."
3,"Nerfed,Patched, But Playable","this game can be fun, but it is nerfed, has been patched to a playable level. ignore the level fest, the only way to be happy in this game is enjoy your newbie lvls."
1,Worst Online Game Ever,"This game is without a doubt the worst excuse for software i have ever tried. The game is buggy beyond all belief. It you can get past the games bugs then you have to get past the billing dept's bugs which even though they charge your credit card the freeze your account and send you an e-mail saying you have not paid them. Once in game the graphics are great. However the game plays is repetitive, combat is hit the ""Q"" key and wait for the outcome. I wish i had back my money and time from this ... game."
3,Will be a good game someday...,"The premise of this mmorpg is a sci-fi power struggle between two groups: Omni-Tek, a super corporation, and the Clans, a large band of freedom fighters. You choose sides or you can stay neutral. Along the way, you eliminate monsters...lots of monster to gain xp to earn levels so you can earn even more levels. The graphics are wonderful and the sound effects are great. The gameplay is terrible ...right now. I hope they will fix all the problems they have soon. My problem with this game is: they should have done this BEFORE they released it to the public. Someday this will be a great game. Until it is, save your money and don't reward Funcom for rushing a product that is far from playable."
2,"ultimately, a great dissappointment","I had hoped that this game would be to the sci-fi gaming world what Asheron's Call was to the fantasy gaming world. From the moment that I got this game in the mail and was not able to play due to technical problems for over a week, I was let down. The bugs in the game continued and Funcom continued promising patches and fixes that only introduced more bugs. After 6 months of sticking with it, the bugs were reduced and I was left with a rather stale and dull game. Most of the combat is against human opponents so that aspect gets old. The PVP part of the game is HORRIBLE. The events driven by Funcom are nearly unplayable due to insane amounts of lag that left my screen frozen. The storyline was non-existent unless you purchased the book they published (what a scam). And there were no quests or special items to obtain..."
1,Don't buy this... yet.,"While the engine and gameplay system show great promise, the current problems plaguing the Anarchy Online servers prevent me from giving this game any more than a single star rating.Of all of the time I have spent trying to play the game, only about 10% of it has been fun.Read up on the problems at the official Anarchy Online forums for a better idea of all of the network, video, and RAM-gobbling issues that users are experiencing."
1,2 Years?! Hello ;),"I must say, I was greatly disappointed. P3 800, 256 meg, GeForce 2.. u n p l a y a b l e btw, on a cable connection. Move for 2 seconds, hard drive hits for 10.. There is no customer support. Did anyone miss out on the fact that they have been writing code for this for 2 years?! I'd be embarassed to say I had anything to do with it. Funcom said they.... who cares, they didn't make it right. I'm not paying for beta.. er alpha testing.. sure EQ started with problems, but they made it right. Funcom fell on their face. Thanks for nothing FC :/"
4,"If you got the money, honey...","OK, so I jumped on this game when it came out in the summer of 2001. At the time, Funcom was dealing with all kinds of data issues, bandwidth problems, leaks, you name it... And, I got fed up, and quit.Fast forward Dec 2001... I gave this game a second shot, and Wow. The concept, on the surface, doesn't seem too different than any action MMORPG out there... however, as the story progresses (A 4 year long story, might I add), it certainly becomes interesting. Hate all that ""Tis Art thou?"" sillyness from games like ""Ultima Online?"" Forget about it... no one here needs no stinkin' accent.It's fun. Action when you want. Friendly people. You'll enjoy it. Do it... give in..."
1,Avoid at all cost!,"With masses of MMORPGs coming out, you will do best to avoid Anarchy Online. The game promises much but delivers nothing. You are forced to do constant boring money runs in so-called missions that include nothing but killing some mobs and that gets pretty old pretty fast. Add to this poor stability, lots of bugs and self-centered development team. AO is a flop. I've been there. You don't have to."
1,They should have called this game Anarchy Offline,This game and Funcom as a company are the worst ever to hit the gaming shelves. If you buy this product you will learn alot of things about your computer that you never wanted to know. Most of all you will learn how to reboot your computer in a timely and efficent manner
2,"Amazing game, horrible system","I played this game once on a friends computer, and was astounded by the graphics, play time and style, and the variability of the game itself. I them bought the game... and have regretted it ever since. I have not been able to play, no matter how many times I download and install patches manually, Funcom support doesn't respond to any queries (they have no phone, and their e-mail system just sends back and automatic reply), and when I tried to unsubscribe from the service, the system wouldn't let me. It's been over a month, and I still can't get online.Don't buy this game."
1,I'd wait to buy this game!,"When I bought this game I didn't realize I was paying for beta 5. This game is not only buggy, but unplayable. Funcom should not have released this game in its present state. My advice is to wait to buy the game, let them fix all the problems first."
1,Worst Game Ever,"Wow, this is THE WORST GAME I have ever played. The items are worthless, you can't sell anything, and its so easy to get high level items, there will be so many high level people it will screw up the balance of the game. I hate to say it, but Id rather dust of my Dioblow 2 than get this game fired up again. Laggy, Choppy, Cr*ppy. That sums it up. Sure it may improve with time, but the gameplay simply isn't there. Funcom turned out to be a real newbie in the world of MMORPGs. EQ is tons more fun. Stick with EQ, you will love it."
3,DAZZLING... yet flawed,"I tried the 7 day trial and ordered it. It's a great game if you love to solo, and the diversity is impressive. You look around and there is so much to see. I have yet to see two players that look the same. Right now I am at the stage of trying different race/class/alignment combinations to determine which one I will level up. I have yet to engage in PvP or group for that matter. I am anxiously awaiting implementation of team missions. I have also found the intricacies of the game fascinating. It will be a while before this bores me. I find this game stimulates my imagination.The flaws are many, disconnects frequent, but in spite of that still worth the time, as I believe Funcom is doing their best to rectify many of the problems."
1,Do NOT buy this horrible horrible game,"This game is a tragedy. Bugs everywhere, instead of fixing the problems, they seem to be making them worse with every patch. Problems plague this game left and right. Do yourself a favor and avoid it at all costs. The game also crashes randomly and doesnt work on like 25% of computers."
1,Game is broken,"I played in the beta for this game and I bought it right at release. It has SOO much promise, but Funcom cannot capitalize on it.They have SERIOUS management problems.They cater to the whims of trolls, they have no strong plan on where to go.Their coders are willing, but very inexperienced.Amateur level stuff. Does not bode well for the future.9-27-01"
2,It couldve been so much...,This game has to be one of the biggest let downs. It was so promising but has been let down by poor programing. Also Funcom's idea of customer support is shocking.I am sorry but I couldnt recoomend this game to anyone in its current state.
1,How bad can it get,"It was really bad the first week, but it did get better. For a few weeks we could play better each day, and in turn see just how boring the game really was.In the last few weeks they turned around and the game is now worse than it was at release. Each patch is a fingers crossed, heart bumping, breath catching nightmare wondering if just your class or perhaps the entire game will be SNAFU this time around.FunCom deserves for the entire computer community to group together and put them out of business. I thought Tribes 2 was a horrid release, and then Coroned Rat proved me wrong. Why oh why couldn't AO be at least as good as WWII Online.Pass on this one, and in fact pass on anything with the FunCom name on it forever."
1,Anarchy Flop,Terrible release...Spent all of the first trying to install and nothing works. After several of the patches it made the problems worse. DO NOT buy this game until the bugs have been worked out. This game is still in beta.
1,Wait and see... It might be fun if it actually worked!,"One star is one too many!This game has a decent back-story and premise. That's about it. Far too many bugs and far too laggy. Terrible customer support, as well.More than a week after my request at canceling my account, I got the following response back by email, ""Your information has been collected and your account will be canceled. This request will take some time to process we are sorry for the inconvienence (sic - they can't even run a spell checker!).""They obviously don't want to cancel my account before my ""free"" month is over!This game may be worth buying once the bugs, lag, and customer service issues are resolved. For now, though, wait and see."
4,"Bugfest? ha, try it out now!","I know it was WAY to buggy the first 2 weeks or so, but funcom has been working 24/7 ever since the release, and it has paid off! I live in Norway, and as you might know, AO is a Norwegian game (Norway= that long, narrow country way north in europe ) hehe. Anywas, the newspapers here have a lot of AO news, so we get constant AO updates in the news. And they all say the same thing, things are really shaping up now! Well, my point is that most of the bad bugs have been fixed now, like the server crashing and game crashing. While you could count on only staying online 5-10 minutes to start with, I have no problems staying onlin 5+ hours playing up a storm now...! So go ahead and buy the game, it's a great game, and it gets better every day! Funcom has done an INCREDIBLE job with this one!=O)"
4,"Anarchy Is Awesome, When you are able to play it",The actual gameplay of Anarchy Online is spectacular and really fun to play. The graphics are gorgeous and the sound is music to your ear. The reason I only gave this game 4 stars was because the stability of AO is terrible. You pretty much have a 50/50 chance of getting on to it. Or once you've logged on there also is a good chance that the server will crash. Luckily FUNCOM has been working on this problem so it seems that it is definetly getting better. Overall AO is definitely the Ever Quest killer when it comes to the actual game. In a month when everything is patched AO will be one breath taking game that everyone should pick up.
4,Potentially a great game,"I started playing AO two days after it was released. I expected there to be problems and indeed, there were problems. Server lag, zoning problems and being unable to log on are just a few of the major ones. Two weeks later, I must say there has been great improvement, but there is still much to be done.The time I have been able to play has been great fun and I can imagine once all the bugs have been sorted out, this will be the best MMORPG out there. The world is expansive, the gameplay is fun, the characters are unique and there is going to be a storyline that promises to be intriguing.If you are looking for an online game to play, I would suggest waiting a month or two before picking up AO, unless you want to deal with limited playing time and frustrating circumstances due to the bugs. Once FunCom gets things with this game straightened out, this game will keep me at my PC all day (and night!)"
2,Graphics great ...lag and disconnects make this unplayable,Ok i was very excited to see something where i could play a MMORPG in a sci fi setting so i preordered it...BIG MISTAKE its been out since the 27th and the lag in cities is BAD i mean so bad my framerate was at 10fps and i could barely move...on top of that you can barely play outside of the newbie areas...trust me dont get this game till they fix it...read the forums about this game its pretty ... ... ...i normally dont say anything bad about something but for Funcom to say this is PLAYABLE? i think not...save your ... and wait for Starwars online or Dark age of Camelot
1,Startup Troubles,Apparently the CD Key codes have been hacked. Funcom will require proof of purchase and I strongly urge anyone who orders this to save all receipts both electronically and paper.
3,"sol33t, but needs work","stunning visuals, cars that fly, like - it can be crowded in towns, fortresses, usually the player cities are empty - everybody too busy shooting each other to party i guessthe games is not for underage, but definitly needs work in the social areas, and i was dissapointed with the difficulty of access to craft - but mebbe its me - that said, i'm not giving up on it just because it can turn into a slogging matchi only didnt give it five stars cause it does need sooooo much work.if you can take the heat, bring your good graphic card, at least 1/2 gig of ram, and join the midnite party! (note - some may not enjoy the tunes - can be a bit raw)"
1,Throwing in the towel at level 170,"The game has 200 lvls im lvl 170 and quiting. It's plagued with bugs and lack of content, total class inbalance. This game should be taken back to the concept drawing boards. DO NOT BUY IT! for your sanity sake."
1,AO CAUSES CANCER,THIS GAME IS SO BAD YOU WILL DIE IF YOU TRY TO PLAY IT. LAB RATS HAVE BEEN MASSACRED BY THE MILLIONS TIN THE BETA TESTING OF THIS GAME. SAVE YOURSELF! FIND ANOTHER MMORPG TO PLAY. OR JUST KILL YOURSELF - ITLL BE LESS PAINFULL THAN PLAYING AO.
2,a...coffee coaster,"Anarchy online is a Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game set on a fictional planet in the distant future. It has an evolving storyline that uses the classic rebels verses the establishment theme. There is no magic in the game. The traditional magic element is replaced by almost equally mystical use of nano-technology. Players can assume the roles of spies, soldiers, doctors, nano-technologists and other various futuristic professions.The graphics are lovely and it has fabulous sound effects. There are no zones (ala Everquest) except for entering apartments, cities and quests. THe interface is... usable...The only problem is that the entire experience left me cold. This game is so lovely that it was almost sterile. Where is its heart and soul?If you love the future and need a switch from the previous MMORPG's on the market try this game. I, in the meantime, will sadly set my coffee cup down on my new...coffee coaster and wait for the next big thing.Singerspell"
1,Troublesome and Tiresome,"AO started with great promise, and failed to live up to any of it. I played this game for 3 months and suffered through what could arguably be the worst and most problem ridden release of any on line game to date. It did not get better. The concept was fine, the execution, horrific. I truly do not believe the programmers have any guidence, customer service is nearly non-existent ( e-mail only no phone) and the game is plagued by bugs and poor, almost weekly, patches. The good things, great graphics, too bad it takes more than eye candy to make a game."
1,"Horrible game, poorly run and poorly implemented.","This game is run very incompetently. Funcom has no idea how to update or improve the game. When I first played I thought the game was ok and perhaps even enjoyable. After each successive patch the game degraded. More crashes and bugs were introduced every patch. I lost items at random and XP loss due to bugs became common place. Do not buy this game, you will regret it in 2-4 weeks."
1,What more can I say - don't buy it!,"The reviews pointing out the major problems in this game are correct in every regard. I feel like I was completely taken advantage of in buying this 'game'. This product is definitely not of commercial quality. Their subscriber base is apparently dwindling, and for good reason. It is a travesty that a product this bad can actually be sold in stores. I wish I could give it 0 stars."
1,Tough to review a game that can't be played,"Folks, I bought this product on the first day and struggled, hard, for hours on end to log in even once to the servers. I failed. You may deride me as an incompetent computer user if you like but in my opinion this game should not have been launched. I cancelled my account and so far have not been charged for that. I will eat the price of the game itself. Lesson? When it comes to MMORPGs do not be the first to buy. Wait at least two weeks, preferably a month to find out if the game will be playable. Its worth the wait the two weeks will not put you that far behind the first day buyers who do manage to log on (if that is a concern, it isn't for me).AV"
2,WHY WAS IT RELEASED?,"Most of you couldn't wait for this game. I am amazed that while I was testing the BETA software for this game I had fewer problems than I did when I started running the purchased game. I guess that they didn't learn from Verant's mistakes.I was online for an hour the other night and only played for about 15 minutes. I was stuck in lag spikes the size of Mt. Everest. I kept fought the same critter for 25 minutes, I timed it.Take care in buying this game until you hear positive stuff from these reviews. You will suffer more frustration than enjoyment at this point. The servers lag is unacceptable, the support is non-existent and the gameplay is for the extremely patient.Good luck..."
1,Major disappointment,"I played beta. I bought a copy and muddled through a horrific first-day-of-release installation. I was able to create and play my character through a variety of expected first-week glitches. But now we're in week 2, and the game is all but unplayable - I cannot zone, I cannot go on the newbie missions, and I cannot leave the backyard where I was ""born."" I have gotten no responses to my petitions and bug reports, and I cannot get onto the AO website to pass on these thoughts. Let me suggest this: hold off on buying this game until you see all the gaming community - the *players* - come out with positive reviews saying this has all changed. Pity.. I was really looking forward to this game."
1,Daniel Nagy,"I would like to review the game. Unfortunately it appears that the company did not test the game thoroughly. You need to register the CD key that comes with the game. Thanks to their horrible coding and non-existent tech support the key comes up as invalid and you have to send email to their tech support (cheap, they don't even have an 800 number or any number for that matter) first. When they FINALLY grace you with a reply other than some idiotic auto reply you then have to FAX them the invoice from Amazon to prove you bought the thing. This is stupid, disorganized and just plain wrong.If you want the game that bad... be prepared to wait and wait and wait. I buzzed the news groups and the boards associated with the game and found that this problem is common and so are many others...."
1,There's so much I COULD say....,"The title of my review says it all. There are so many problems with this game I could go on for hours talking about them. But since most of those problems have been described in numerous other reviews here, I'll go straight to my summation....Save your money. Save your time. Save yourself. Don't buy AO."
2,Dont do it yet,"I, as one of the players on AO since Beta4 (there are many), would say to customers DO NOT BUY THIS GAME yet. It isn't very playable, and there is not alot of content yet to boot. Wait for a couple months and if FunCom is still around and AO has dropped in proce by at least 15 bucks, then pick it up and hope you can play it. Good luck. I just cancelled my account to AO the other day along with countless others."
3,WAK Art,Lock and key united is one of my favorite black pieces of art works however anything mass produced tends to loose quality as is the case here. Its a poster not a picture or drawing.
2,A little disappointing,"I was disappointed with this video. It reviews some basic skills for young players but I didn't think this was helpful for coaching. I was hoping for a video which was more geared for the coach and was hoping for more examples of many different specific drills that I can use in practice. This video reviews skills (which I already know)but doesn't take that to the next level for a coach. Knowing the skills, you then have to use your own imagination about putting together a practice. This video is better geared towards kids to watch and learn for themselves, though it is a little dry."
4,The 80's Youth,"This is an amazing play, very moving. It captures the bizarre in the ordinary: the lives of three teenagers growing up in a troubled era and looking for ways to be different and stand for something, when there is nothing to rebel against. Wonderful characters, ideas, and dialogue. Beautiful in its simplicity and painful in its candour."
4,Sustainable Communities,"Judy and Michael Corbett have written a brief and thoughtful, not to mention well-informed book on the subject of designing and building sustainable communities. The various chapters on the history of their subject, on their seminal and justifiably respected community in Davis, CA, and on elements of the planning process and the integration of real estate pragmatics with environmental ideals will serve as both a user-friendly introduction for lay readers and a handy reference for professionals looking to expand their horizons. The writing is clear and uncomplicated, the design of the book is simple and straightforward, and there is the nice sense throughout that it has been put together by people who know wherof they speak. One complaint: it's unclear why a paperback published by a non-academic press would be priced a bit high but it is unfortunate, as it will serve to prevent this book from reaching the broader audience it deserves."
5,Very cool shirt.,"The picture of the item and the description say its a red shirt, but it is not. It, or what I got, is a black shirt. The zombie silhouettes are dark grey with yellow eyes. I honestly am glad I got the black instead of the red."
4,Tha Cruzades Through Arab Eyes,It is a very interesting bookWe are used to read about the Crusades under the occidental eyesThe difficulty in reading it is the profusion of names and locals mentioned but the history is very well describedI strongly recommend this book.Dr. Saide Calil
4,Cultures Clash and Culture Deceives,"This book explains the crusades as primarily political invasions, without much true spirituality involved for many participants. He shows, interestingly, that many Christians were better treated under Muslim rulers than under the rule of Europeans. You will benefit from seeing how there were good people on all sides of the conflicts, as well as the bad.An important part of this book, is the Epilogue. In this summary, a comparison is made of the ""Franj-administered"" and ""Occidental-administered"" territories, with emphasis on the rights and responsibilities of rulers and subjects. There is a lot of wisdom in this comparison, and should be studied well by those attempting to envision institution-building in the future. Especially when any act of violence against the western lands or westerners can be portrayed in Arab media simply as vengeance for expeditions in 1191AD. For reviews of similar books, see the resources pages at civilsociety at seedwiki. Thanks."
3,"NOT BAD, BUT NOT OBJECTIVE","Not a bad book, that paints muslims colourfully as a poor little people constantly crushed by evil christians. It starts in 1099 with first crusade. and shows how cruel and evil crusaders were. But our dear Amin Maalouf forgets a ""little"" detail. For about 300 years muslims were conquering Europe and this was just an answer. In 732 muslim army tried to conquer France and was (thankfully) stopped by Charles Martel at Tours. Muslims conquered Spain, Asia Minor, attacked Byzantine empire. Poor little peacefull muslims, arent they? THEY ARE NOT. And this books is not objective in any way."
1,A Big Lie,"The crusades were a defensive move in reaction to hundreds of years of violent jihad that spread Islam by force to the heart of Europe. True, the battles were bloody but that is they way they waged warfare back then. For a more accurate view read Robert Spencers Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam."
4,Great companion to other books about the Crusades.,This is an excellent book to read while studying the crusades and crusaders. We must never forget the other side also has a story to tell and that can change out own perpective of our recorded history.
5,History at its best!,"I love it when I find hidden jewels like this. Amin Malouf ranks high up on my list of favourites. Its hard to find a history book that is a page turner at the same time but remains focused on the subject throughout. Although its been a while since I read this book, I still remember the excellently detailed descriptions of the battles and sieges and some of the sickening atrocities committed by both sides (Muslims and Christians) against the innocent. There's so much more that can't be said here. Read it and you'll become a fan."
5,A reversal of historical roles,"This book had some pretty decent historical references that were enjoyable to read. Some of the referenced material can be found from other texts written by western authors. This book however, had a greater density of arab references of the times than you would find in most crusader period books.The most compelling part of this book was the authors own analysis and commentary on the subject. Very well written and organized. It is a must read for someone who is a student of this period."
4,Not as biased as the title suggests.,"The advantage of this history of the Crusades is that the author provides significant insight regarding the historical tensions within the Arab ""states"" or tribes during the 11th and 12th centuries and how the frequent unwillingness of those often warring factions to help each other fend off the Crusaders, and their general ineptness in doing so, contributed to the horrible successes of the Christian marauders and the massacre of tens of thousands of ""non-believers,"" which included large numbers of Eastern Orthodox Christians. The writing (translation) is somewhat dry, but the story is very interesting."
4,The other side,"We have here an average history addition to Crusader history. What makes it interesting is that we get a feel of the other side.What we have is a relatively small group of Christians in a region full of Arabs. It is amazing that they lasted as long as they did probably as unlike the Western leaders deeply involved in the Crusades many Arabs leaders had many other issues rather then the crusaders to think about. So often they were willing to make deals with the Crusaders.Immediately it is clear how much is missing from the books on the crusaders now available, as it seems that much material available from the Arab side is missing from them.Worth a read."
5,Reads like a novel,"Some reviewers criticize this book as not being objective but it was never meant to be. This book is an attempt to approach the crusades from an Arab perspective by relying on Arab historians of the period. Maalouf does a magnificent job at making a historical narrative very entertaining and easy to read.Maalouf, a Christian Lebanese who grew up in a country torn by religious war, presents a vivid desciption of the horrors of the Crusades.This book is very useful to understanding the Middle East today in its relationship with the West."
4,The Crusades Through Arab Eyes,"This book is well described by its title. Amin Maalouf provides the historical perspective of the Crusades from the point of view of Arabs. Maalouf begins with the arrival of the Franj (""a word which is used in colloquial Arabic even today to designate Westerners, and the French in particular"") and chronicles the conflict, ending with the conflict with the Mongols.Maalouf utilizes the perspective of Arab historians of the day in order to give the book a high degree of legitimacy. This analysis based of primary sources is the reason that I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in history, and of course anyone who wishes to fully understand the Crusades."
4,"Good, could be better","As teacher of an Environmental Engineering course (at Ariel Academic College, Israel) and as consulting engineer, I find the book useful, but... Some areas are weak: Population and demand prognosis, Resource planning, Economic evaluation and optimization, Advanced water treatment (membrane and ion exchange technologies, for example), Desalination of brackish and sea water. Each chapter has a well explained exercise, a very useful feature, but most are non metric. All in all, I know of no better textbook, and it is worth its money."
2,Waterboy Fan from the Beginning Says....,"This album may not appeal to fans of the first 4 Waterboy albums up through ""Fisherman's Blues."" It is similar in flavor to ""Dream Harder"", which I found disappointing and pedestrian. The Big Music from the earlier albums was not about louder, harder guitar riffs, which Scott seems to have embraced. Rather, it was about soaring melodies, richly textured instruments, and passionate, folk-rooted songs. That wondrously unique sound has devolved into straight-ahead rock (save for the excellent ""Love Anyway"", the only song reminiscent of the earlier Waterboys. There is certainly no ""December"" or ""Pagan Place"" on this album. So much talent, but seeming to lack direction."
4,Great watch and stylish,I love my Deisel watch. It is my favorite casual watch that I can wear with just about any style. My only complaint is that the leather is stiff and makes it a little uncomfortable when I bend my wrist. I wish the leather was more flexible.
1,the goods never received,"Good afternoon ... This merchandise will buy in August and to date I have received, who is responsible?"
4,Bewitching,"From the droning opening of ""Utopia,"" Combustible Edison's ""The Impossible World"" announces itself as lounge music for the jetset. ""20th Century"" could be a soundtrack for a montage sequence from a 60s sitcom like ""Bewitched"" with its bright perky off-center instrumental with xylophone & loopy keyboards. Miss Lily Banquette croons like a Secret Agent theme for depressives on ""Pink Victim."" ""Hot & Bothered"" is delightfully horny beach music complete with squeals and sighs. The wispy ""Seduction"" comes across like a romance between ghosts. ""The Garden of Earthly Delights"" sounds like a gondola cruise in Venice with its airy female vocals. ""The Impossible World"" might not be the greatest CD on the planet, but it is tremendously original and a lot of fun! Enjoy!"
3,DON'T GET MISLEADED,"Only tree stars, gentlemen. For me their first album is still the best. IMPOSSIBLE WORLD is too quirky, too complicated and ... well, less innovative than you could expect from ComEd. Flirting with new modern sounds made a small contribution to the album, sometimes it gets boring. Though the work of high quality I'd stick to elder ones."
2,"An amazing story, but a hit and run book","I know many of the people personnaly that were in this book, and find it hard to believe the lack of research that was done - not much more than ordering newspaper articles and court transcripts. He misses easy to look-up facts like where Debbie Rowan is from (she's from Boise, not Weiser, and she didn't grow up with Bruce as the book states).I was at the Rowan trial, and it was obvious that he was innocent to everyone there. That 12 jurors voted 11-1 on the first ballot that he was not guilty, and eventually agreed that he was not culpable for the crime speaks for itself. This author was obviously not at any of the trials - I would be surprised if he ever visited Port Angeles.A fasinating story for sure - read it if you have not read anything else. This book is basically a long newspaper article, with very little insight."
2,not up to par,"I was disappointed in this CD, and on top of that I paid 20 dollars, I would give it away if I knew anyone who wanted it. Jose Carreras is such a great singer but this was a disappointment to me."
3,Maestro Carreras sings Operetta and Broadway,"Even though I love the selection of arias and songs, I think Jose should stick to more classical works that fits his style and lyric voice. I admire Jose for his ""crossover"" offerings, but there is much more that I'd rather hear on disc than ""Rose Marie"" or ""If I Loved You"".In the phrase of ""afraid and shy"" Jose sounds like he is singing ""a Frankenstein"". I own over forty Carreras CD's and probably will buy even more no matter what the works may be, but I'd rather have Jose offer works like Puccini's ""Avanti urania"" and Menti all'avvisio"" and ""sole amore"". Works that he often performs on stage in recital format. That's when the Maestro is at his best!"
3,Adequate,"This book presents a very physical form of Qigong (Chi Kung) that seems at first more like calisthenics. The descriptions of the moves are sometimes hard to follow, but there are many photographs that illustrate the moves. Particularly helpful is the appendix that shows all of the major meridians and the points on them.This is one of the few books I've seen that focuses on Qigong from a medicinal perspective. The author lists which exercises may be performed for specific ailments. It is a down-to-earth book that gives basic information, but its drawback is that it begins to touch upon deeper issues, such as the five elements, and then abrubtly moves on."
2,Already broke,2 weeks old and it's broke already. Squirrels are macho squirrels here. It hit the ground and broke all to pieces.
2,hot tin roof,"I should have known...An all metal bird feeder in the hot Texas sun attracts nothing, not even the squirrels! Don't know if it's squirrel-proof or not as they won't even try it. Birds try to perch but fly away quickly as the feeding bar is too hot for tiny feet. Perhaps we'll have better luck this winter, but I suspect the exact opposite will occur and cold toes will keep feathered and furry friends at bay."
5,Works great - keeps squirrels out.,It fun to watch the frustration of the squirrels trying to get into the feeder when it closes on them.
5,Works for me,"Unlike the reviews below, this feeder has given us excellent service. I purchased this for my Mother to use. Her backyard is Squirrel Central and she is always on the lookout for a feeder for feathered critters, not furry ones.This feeder is very easy to fill and to date no squirrels has been observed successfully getting any seed out of it. Which isn't to say they don't try, but so far their schemes have failed them. The saga continues...."
2,Not real happy,"I've had this feeder several years. While I haven't noticed the squirrels getting into it like the reviewer above, I have had a problem with the feeder being balanced to the rear. This effectively pushes the seed away from the opening after the birds eat everything they can reach in the opening, making it necessary for me to go and shake the seed toward the front way too often. I have several other feeders of this type which are much more satisfactory. On the plus side, the birds like eating from it."
1,Not squirrel proof at all,"Can't tell you how much feed I've wasted in this feeder. Finally just threw the feeder away. The squirrels just land on top of it, hook their foot on the hanger, lean over the side and put their other foot on the seed port (totally bypassing the door that's supposed to close). Then they lean in and gobble up the seed. In addition, the raccoons get on top of it at night and shake it until all the seed just falls out. I've tried adding a dome over the top, a longer hanging arm so that they have to jump father to get on top of it, a lighter setting on the counterweight (which meant it closed when the birds alighted on it). Nothing has worked. The squirrels simply outwit this feeder which totally defeats its intended purpose."
2,Doesn't work.,"My squirrels saw through this feeder in a matter of days. They hang off of the side, so that their weight doesn't tip the feeder, and then they eat till they are full. There are also larger cracks in the side that allows them to get at the seed. Its a nice feeder, but it doesn't keep the squirrels out."
1,Hertitage Farms Squirrel Proof Bird Feeder,"Heritage Farms ""Squirrel Proof"" Bird Feeders are anything but! To be remotely squirrel proof it must be in an area where squirrels cannot get onto it from any location. This means it has to be at least 10 ft from any structure, tree, bush or pole. That means it has to be pole mounted and you will then need a baffle to prevent them from climbing up the pole. The springs on the outside of the feeder provide a place for the squirrels to hang on as well as the sharp corners that they can grasp. I have tried modifying this feeder several different ways and they still can manage to hang on and eat from it. Forget all forms of this feeder and go with the Homestead Super Stop-a-Squirrel Feeder, it really is squirrel proof!"
1,Unsafe,"We have lost 3 birds who have gotten their feet caught in the ""perch"" mechanism. While the idea is a novel one and it makes sense, the reality is small finches and other birds can easily get their feet caught and struggle to free themselves."
2,Not squirrel proof,I purchased this birdfeeder so the squirrels could not get the birds food. However the squirrels are able to sit on the feeder and eat without it closing. I was very disappointed in the feeder and can not recommend it. I am still using the old feeder I had that IS squirrel proof.
2,Hanging mechanism poor design,The feeder itself is nice and has held up great. Unfortunately after only about a month of it hanging on a shepherd's hook the metal bracket no longer stays in the holes and the whole feeder falls.
4,From Back Cover,"She'll make love to him! Taylor Hanson has never forgotten the hot sizzling weekend she'd shared with Ben Bowman, her brother Steve's best buddy. The sex was incredible, but Ben left town abruptly - and she's never gotten over him. Now they're reunited for Steve's wedding in Vegas. For one week, she's decided Ben will be her Man To Do.

But he's going to have to ensure she doesn't just climb out of bed one morning and walk away.From the Men to Do! mini-series."
4,Great information yet author's style is a bit cumbersome.,"The information gleaned from the personal letters written by soldiers on both sides of the battle offer a unique insight into the unimaginable suffering of the siege. Although the author's research is extensive and the amount of detail amazing, it is presented in a text book style that can be tedious at times. All in all, a great history book."
4,A good book,"This author gives just the right amount of detail to give the reader a feel for the misery and incredible dispair of the foot soldier without the tendency of some writers to confuse the reader with unnecessary names,dates and diagrams. The common soldier has a place in this book along with the general. Perhaps too much mention of the body lice."
4,"Horrible, compelling, awesome!","I never, never read war books; they are usually so full of boring details and implied rightousness. This one is none of that. Understandable, thorough, even-handed. Mr. Beevor's grammar and sentence structure are not the greatest, but he tells the story very well. I couldn't put it down."
5,Absolutely first-rate,"Well-written, absorbing, insightful. I found it hard to put down. I recommend it highly."
4,Stalingrad,"Mr. Beevor is a wonderful writer. Well written, I book I throughly enjoyed reading. If you like ww2 history you will like this book."
2,Squandered potential of a story of war at its fiercest,"Half the book is culled from other sources. The interesting personal details and on-the-spot play-by-play descriptions tantalize as to what a good book this could have been. Beevor doesn't know what to do with all his research or his publisher had him throw it out for mass market appeal. Whichever it was, it's a cowardly act pandering to fiscal factors and populist appeal rather than a gritty, word-picture of the period. There was definitely not enough detail on Stalingrad street fighting and too much historical context. The balancing act between history and portraying war does not come off in this book."
2,Disjointed,"A best-seller in the UK (according to the Economist), but 100 pages in I find that the narrative doesn't flow. The paragraph marks seem to be completely arbitrary; few thoughts hang together. The big picture frequently gets lost in the details. Antony Beevor is no Shelby Foote (but who is?). Hope it gets better when the main battle finally starts!"
3,A Little Too Kind to the Germans,"While I found much to admire in Stalingrad, the author was just a little too soft on the Germans for my liking. The politics aside, I thought it was an interesting, if a bit dense, retelling of the epic battle."
3,hit or miss,"The book is pretty exhaustive but very scatter-shot. Perspective switches from paragraph to paragraph. The chapters follow a timeline but seem to be more of a hodge podge draft rather than a finished product. Like a compilation of ideas/quotes/snippets instead of a coherent ""story""."
2,Awful writing style with great content,"The author certainly knows the material to a microscopic detail. However, his rambling asides make this book a non-keeper unless you're an absolute junkie on the material.I put the book down in disgust without finishing it."
2,Check it out from the library.,"There are so many problems with punctuation that I get too distracted to read any more. Not only that, but the author uses terms and events which are unknown to the average reader. The organization is terrible. The author jumps around from scene to scene with little to no transition."
2,uninspired,"Like many reviews below note: 1) the writing is fairly workmanlike; 2) surprisingly little text is devoted to the actual city fighting; and 3) there are many references (in my opinion, somewhat forced) to soldiers' letters from the front. It added up to a book I found interesting at moments but otherwise uninspired."
1,Overrated: a popular fictionalized narrative history,"Beware books that rate five stars on this site.Not a bad book, but, the narratives are fictionalized:Hitler (foaming at the mouth): ""Stalingrad must be destroyed!""Stalin (eyes ablaze): ""Fight to the bitter end!""And so on...Now, how would the author know exactly what was said? Maybe his previously classified treasure trove of musty old materials.But, I have been overrulled by hoi polloi, who seem to love this emphasis on volume over mass."
4,The Fateful Siege,"I thought this was an excellent look at the battle of Stalingrad. Antony Beevor covers all the bases from countless accounts from soldiers in the trenches (& ruins) - both German & Russian, to events involving a few soldiers to entire divisions. Then he explains how some of the major players on the Russian front made their decisions & acted under pressure.The detailed information doesn't stop there - much of the book details the almost personal battle between Stalin & Hitler and all that Stalingrad represented to both sides. Antony Beevor does a great job of describing what was going on in other parts of the European theater of war & how they tied into this great battle. This was a pivital battle that affected the future of every country touched by world war 2. Worth reading."
3,Not enough maps!,"I bought this book based in an episode of Peep Show, a British comedy series. Mark, one of the characters who is the ultimate self effacing, nerdy doofus, is reading it. His major talent is in history, but of course that has nothing to do with how his real life operates. I loved the detail about daily life for all participants in the Stalingrad debacle. All the troop movements were like reading the dullest passages of the Bible without good maps to follow the action. Sheesh. Oh, well, I don't read much these days anyway, so maybe I am just being a curmudgeon. Or not."
4,Very enthralling,"An thougoughly amazing review of human arrogance, incompetence and destruction that has left scars on the world"
4,Excellent strategic perspective on the battle,"Beevor writes an excellent strategic perspective on arguably the most important battle of World War II. I thought it was well researched and gave the reader an excellent perspective on the importance and impact of the battle. After finishing it, however, I wanted to know more personal accounts of the battle, from both sides. The author teased the reader with nondescript, brief personal accounts, but I think the strategic perspective could have been enhanced with some first hand survivor stories. Particularly, those of a German who survived the battle and captivity."
4,"Realistic, with the benefit of input from people who were there.","Usually, war experience books tend to rely on information released by, written by, and compiled by the ""top brass"", be it generals, politicians and official archives. They are usually complemented by maps with arrows pointing at troop movements and major battles and photos of war scenarios. This book, although having all that, also contains anecdotes and information provided by foot soldiers, auxiliary battle personnel, such as medics and nurses, and even children who underwent very traumatic experiences. It provides a realistic, down-to-earth (literally) picture of what was the major turning point of WW II, Hitler's Waterloo. Not for the squeamish.I recommend this book wholeheartedly."
4,Engrossing Human Story,"When I began the book I wasn't sure what to expect, other than the history of one of the pivotal battles of the 20th Century. To say that I was pleasantly suprised is an understatement. Beevor's book is much more than just a history of the Battle of Stalingrad. Rather it is a history of the individuals who participated in the battle and its human cost.Given the history of the Russian Army from the outbreak of the was up to Stalingrad, one would not have expected that the Soviets would have been able to made the stand that they did. Beevor explains the process that led to the transformation of the Russian Army, blemishes and all. He does the same for the German Army.Stalingrad is ultimately a human drama, since notwithstanding the generals and commanders it was the Russian soldier that defeated the German soldier. That is the strength of the book and makes it a very good read."
4,Fascinating,"I listened to the abridged audio in my car. It was fascinating. The author did a good job of describing what life was like for the soldiers, while at the same time documenting the tactical and strategic aspects of the battle. It is clear that this battle destroyed the Wehrmacht. It was only a matter of time after Stalingrad."
2,A Biased View,"Although the Russo-German war was a battle between two totalitarian leaders (Hitler and Stalin), Beevor's writing style is biased in favour of the Soviets. Instead of relating the excesses of both sides, and placing the blame on both sides, Beevor is consistently trying to convince the reader that the Soviets are worthy of our sympathy. There are better descriptions of the battle at Stalingrad. Too bad this isnt one of them."
3,"A Good Study, But.....","Mr. Beevor does a great job of telling the human side of this great conflict. His treatment of the letters home, plight of the ""Hiwis"" and POWs is extraordinary. But I feel as though things of great significance are left out of the book. The tactics and detail of the street fighting are given short shift. The main strategy behind the Nazi push south was the oil fields. Did they ever get there? Did anybody try to convince Hitler to leave Stalingrad and push toward what the war machine needed (fuel)? A good, if somewhat depressing, read. If you like the human side, you'll enjoy this. If you want tactics, search elsewhere."
3,clinical reviw of the Stalingrad campaign.,Passionless and too detailed. Needed more personalities and flavor to interest me.
5,Riveting,"I read this book in just a few days. It was so fluently and vividly written that it was hard to put down. I have subsequently recommended it to several of my 11th and 12th Grade students who have likewise been captivated by it and encouraged to go on and read other Beevor books. Given the reluctance of today's high school students to read anything more than 100 pages long, this is a considerable tribute!"
4,An outstanding depiction of a terrible battle,"Antony Beevor is a well-known historian but this is the first book of his that I've read.As with Sir Max Hastings, he does an outstanding job of bringing a world historical event to life by using primary sources to draw vivid pictures from the accounts of civilians, military commanders and the soldiers who carried out (or disobeyed) their orders. The futility and horror of war is something that we as a society must constantly keep in mind."
4,Good thumbnail sketch.,"Well written concise account of the battle and the campaign. A good introduction to the material with Beevor's own analysis and new (apparently) primary sources added into the mix. The account of the activities of a german pathologist who conducted a number of post-mortem examinations during the seige is an example of material not readily, or otherwise, available to english-speaking readers. As a student of disease and epidemiology I found Beevor's treatment of the 'lice' and other health problems too understated--if anything. We in the west too often forget that insects can be deadly, due to the diseases they carry, as well as a nuisance.His treatment of the ""christmas issue"" was also an interesting aspect of the battle I had never considered. A very good effort overall."
5,Hell On Earth,"After reading Sajer's The Forgotten Soldier and Beevor's Stalingrad one after the other, I felt as though I might understand what war on the cold Russian steppe really was. This book describes the hideousness of battle in and around Stalin's Grad. Like another reviewer I put this book up there with Shelby Foote's Civil War masterpiece. Setup well and hard to set down."
1,Does not reflect the whole truth and too biased,"This book looks quite biased with elements of racism, just look at his ""monkey on the top of elephant"" about soldiers who won that ugly war and saved the world from fascism. I would recommend a good review of this book before you start reading [...]"
3,A Common WW II book,The great battle is only written in a rather straight forward way and is rather dull. Nothing special can be found in this book.
4,A well written account of a phenomenal battle,"STALINGRAD is a good read. It describes the battle and many of the lesser known facts about both the Russian and the German mind set during the seige. The ruthless Russian military that executed over 13,000 of its own soldiers for everything from desertion to not being in a particular place (such as the field hospital)when sought out!The arduous winter and the initial German jubilation which soon soured and turned to defeat is also explored.The book is really quite hard to put down once you get going and it is a good addition to any WWII collection. Also the price of ther book is very reasonable."
4,Quality overview of the Battle of Stalingrad,"Mr. Beevor writes an exceptional overview of what is the pivotal battle on the eastern front during World War II. However, he doesn't adequately portray the nature of the conflict within Stalingrad. I was disappointed that he didn't dicuss in detail the street fighting and urban warfare that fixed the Nazi 6th Army within Stalingrad. This is the crucial element of the battle and the decisive point that facilitates massive envelopements by the Soviet armies. A good read both for its content and substantive value, I recommend this book to any student of military history or history in general."
3,"Worth Your Money, But...","I enjoyed this book a lot...it offered a readable overview of the Battle for Stalingrad, the political forces behind it, and the effect on the rest of the war. My only issues were the one-sidedeness of the account. The author mainly discusses the Germans, and their struggles, without really going into the Russians, and what they faced while defending their city. Another point--a large portion of the book deals with the 6th Army, and what happened to them during their encirclement. This is, of course, interesting, but I was expecting a bit more about Stalingrad, and the battle within. But, despite the neglect of the Soviet point of view, the book still gives a great impression of how horrible the war on the Eastern Front was, and how Stalingrad changed the tide of the conflict. All in all, a good book."
5,This History Isn't A Mystery,"Antony Beevor has managed, with this book, to describe one of the most horrific battles the world has ever seen and make it read like a gripping drama novel.Beevor has painstakingly researched this topic, from both the Soviet and German perspectives, and has constructed a narrative of unparalleled depth and accuracy; yet it does not read like a boring historical tome. With such detail, Beevor illustrates the characters, the scenarios, the angst, the letters home and the feeling of total hopelessness on the steppe.This is one of the best books you are likely to ever read; truly an amazing journey into the depths of behaviour, that like all profound portraits of war, begs the question: WHY?"
3,An in-depth look at the battle on the Ostfront,"Well written, well researched, lots of details. If you want to know about the Battle for Stalingrad and the larger picture of the Ostfront, this is a great book. It's dry and sometimes hard to follow and lacking on maps, but overall a good war history book."
3,"Good history book, not to good storytelling.","After reading reviews for this I thought this was going to be an exciting book. But I found out that it is not very exciting. The author gives good historical insight to the battle of Stalingrad, but the stories are often dry, leaving me reading it numbingly. I found it to ""to the point"". He tells you what happened, but leaves no room for emotions. All in all it's a good history book, but not if you're looking for some excitement."
4,Excellent high level telling of a crucial conflict,"This is the battle of Stalingrad as serious history, covering the geo-politics and economic as well as military situation. However, Beevor manages to capture the human tragedy and drama without losing track of the big picture, ultimately leaving it a well-balanced, readable account with no flaws."
5,good stuff,anything Vic writes is worth reading..............especially his book on teaching kids tennis...............good for any parent of an athletic kid.
4,Traditional Regency from an English author,"It's the first time I've come across one of her books even though according to the book she has had more than thirty published. I was impressed by the characters and by the way the author guides the plot through the book.From the back cover of the hard back edition.:A surprising solution!Miss Cassandra Thornton is unaware that before his death her brotherJack made five of his friendspromise that one of them would marry her! Lord Vincent Carlton,having drawn the short straw, requests his mother to invite Cassie for a visit. Having recently become an heiress, Cassie knows she needs help to bring her into style, but it also means she can wait for the right man to marry. In a quandary, Vinnie decides to wait beforeproposing...A Regency delight!"
2,"Mumble, mumble",I'm really disappointed... it has a true bad sound quality: there is no balance between the components of the ensemble... brass overlook the choir always and this gives to the music a sense of dirt and confusion that you are unable to appreciate the artistic quality and performance ... rejected!
3,Slightly Disappointed,"I love the flip-flop design because I am a flip-flop fanatic! However, the description should have been clearer because the curtain is actually cloth. So I ended up spending more money to go get a plastic curtain to put behind this one."
5,So cute!,This shower curtain is so cute and I get many compliments on it. I put a white liner behind and it is fine (some have commented on the sheerness of it). The matching accessories are great too!
1,Very Disappointed!,This fabric was so sheer and flimsy. The colors are very pale and not at all how they appear in the photo. Skip this one and keep looking!
3,Flip Flop Shower Curtain,"Very disapointed with the curtain, EXTREMELY thin and very see through even with a liner!!!"
2,Disappointed,I thought the pockets would be on the inside of your shower - who wants them on the outside? Disappointed in the product - deceiving.
5,one of my favorite country cds,If you like texas country music-make sure you listen to this cd its one of my favorite when Im out on the open highway or riding my horse with my cd player
1,DONT WASTE PENNY ON THIS PRODUCT!,"""I don't like it at all, it doesnt work well, lets nearly no air out and doesn't clean anything...Maybe it'll clean some air if you let it work for a day or two... Bad..""Dont buy it you'll regret...P.S1 Star because there is no 0 selection..."
5,Great little cups,"These small cups are just the right size, and great for mouthwash usage in our break room area prior to working with their clients."
5,How do you rate Medicine cups?,"Great quality, disposable, nothing else really matters does it? It worked out well for what I need it for (taking measured amounts of liquid vitamins)"
5,Great cups,"We use these for a variety of uses at home (mostly for medicines) and they are a great pack. We had a hard time finding an assorted set. Whatever we found had the same size. This assortment works nicely for us. The cups are dishwasher safe too, we have washed them numerous times and they have help up over time."
4,Useful with with variety of units of measure.,Similar to the measuring cups that often accompany cough syrup bottles but these include many useful units of measure you don't normally get with the standard cups.Useful for hobbies and measuring medicine for the dogs.1-8 drams (Don't normally see this)1/8-1 fluid ounce (This one's standard)1-2 tablespoon (This one's standard)2.5-30 ml (Don't normally get this and my reason for buying these)and cc (Also not normally on standard cups)holds up to 1 ozpack of 100 in plastic sleeve.
5,Perfect measuring cup,"I wanted a disposable cup for measuring gas additives. I mix 1 ounce of an AMSOIL additive into gasoline and I was tired of guessing how much an ounce was or saving and reusing a messy measuring cup. These little gems are perfect for my need. Sometimes I need a half ounce; the measurements are marked in quarter-ounce increments. It starts with 1/8th of an ounce. The cups also have 1/2 and 1 teaspoon plus 1 and 2 tablespoon measurements, along with 30 MLs, 30 CCs, and 8 Drams--whatever those are. These cups are inexpensive and intended for single use. Just what I need for my garage."
3,"Nice look, poor quality","Didnt last a month. Burned up already, have had this problem with street glow before. Really a shame as these bulbs give off such a nice white/blueish light."
1,Beware of Fakes,"I Ordered StreetGlow High Performance Xenon Bulbs H9005 100Watt and H9006XS 80 Watt directly from Amazon, not an outside store. The price and shipping was fine, but I noticed that one of the bulbs had a scratch in the blue tint (weird), I then noticed that the blue tint was just a blue coating on the bulb and not in the glass. Also, the gasket was black not purple like all StreetGlow lights and it had the wrong printing on the side with no street glow logo. FAKES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Packaging was identical to the real product. I've had many StreetGlow bulbs and these, were strait fraudulent scams. I also tried the bulbs in the car and surprise, it looked yellow compared the real bulbs. Lame!!!!!!!!!"
4,Good,Seems to be a little rough and not polished; but no flaws this time. Would buy again from this company.
4,wonderful and wacky,"What a cool book! A bit of history,folklore and just a lot of fun. If you read cookbooks like novels this is definitely a book you will enjoy.Would make a great gift for curious food friends (hint - hint)or lovers of offbeat and odd facts."
5,More please,I truly enjoyed this book and want more. Since I don't like to back track I wish I had read her other books in this series first. Good read though.
4,I liked it.,"Good but not great. A good book for a break from a lot of ""heavy"" reads. Would recommend for that reason only."
3,Good story with flaws,"I found this book to be quite engrossing but the very sudden, inconclusive ending completely spoiled it for me. The author went into so much detail in describing scenes and people and then suddenly ran out of steam at the end."
4,unexpected,I enjoy books that have a twist that I do not see coming -- a little nail biting as well!
5,Kept Me Up 'Til the Wee Hours,"I couldn't put this book down. I was so surprised as I expected an OK book. I loved Madeline's character. I envy Madeline's wisdom in discovering her joy while still young enough to enjoy it. I like that she's determined and steadfast. I like that she can give in to the disappointments and fears that life bring, yet rebound with a new strength.I like the twists and turns in the book itself. I'll be looking for more from this author and more of Madeline.I couldn't put it down. Went to work with only two hours of sleep for a few days."
4,Pleasantly surprised,I have not read anything by this author before and am always leery of reading books by someone I've never heard of. I enjoyed this book very much.
3,The author was too focused on her next book,"While this book had lots of potential, it failed to live up too it. Too many references to the ex husband that is showcased in book 3. By the end, I realized to late that I had wasted my time reading this train wreck. The third book in the series is equally disappointing. Too bad the author lost her mojo after the first book."
4,Video Game Hunter - Astroids (Atari 2600),Length:: 4:01 MinsI'm video game hunter. I hunt down video games and review them. This is my first video game. Reivew so please enjoy.
2,Unreadable and historically inaccurate,"Call it a pet peeve if you will, but I prefer my historical fiction to be more or less historically accurate. Daughter of the Forest presents a medieval Ireland in which ""Britons"", by which the author seems to mean Saxons, are invading concurrently with the Northmen. This is not accurate; nor is the vague, fantasy-cliche portrayal of early Irish society. Even readers for whom historical verisimilitude is not an issue will probably be bored by the plodding, mundane writing style and slow plot of this book. I recommend giving this misty, New-Agey goop a miss."
5,Brilliant,"I read Daughter of the Forest months ago and have waited in eager anticiaption for her next, and I believe equally enticing second book, Son of the Shadows. I am not sure what it is exactly about both of these books that so draws me in, but I seem to find myself totally engrossed through out each of the stories and most often than not I read and read without being able to put the books down! I find myself quite often sitting with tears streaming down my face feeling each bit of pain or each tiding of joy that meets these remarkable heroines. The author seems to have an inaliable ability to take you deep within her stories so that you feel surrounded by the words and almost know them as your own....I do not usually sit weeping when I read a book and I can not say what touches me so deeply about her writing but I think she is marvelous and I certainly hope she writes more and quickly too.....Beautifully crafted, BRAVO!!!"
2,Only Applies to the Kindle Edition,"I love this book. I loved it. But I have to say, if you are a stickler for good copyediting you may want to steer away from the kindle edition of this book. There are numerous typos throughout the entire text.I love reading on the kindle, but I'm planning on buying the next two books in the series in paper just to be sure I don't have to read, ""Ton"" instead of ""You,"" about twenty times (in addition to all the other typos, this is just the one that popped immediately to mind.)Nothing ruins a good passage like suddenly finding a garbled word with superscript numbers and dashes in the middle of a sentence."
5,very engaging,"I'd never read this author before, but was quickly caught up in the magical, mystical world of Sorcha. Have just finished the 2nd book and beginning the third in this trilogy. Would highly recommend all of Terry Goodkind books to fantasy lovers out there...he's the absolute BEST but Marillier is quite enjoyable as well."
2,Just another bodice ripper,Taking an old folk tale and constructing a full length novel around it is a good idea. Unfortunately this book turns out to be a bodice ripper. Perhaps I've been spoiled by too much Marian Zimmer Bradley
5,Wow. Oh wow.,This book is absolutely stunning. It's amazing! I read it in two nights. Wow. Oh wow. Read it or miss out on something truly unique.
2,Blah...,"I had high hopes for this book and was sorely disapointed.I'll give it that the plotline was ingenious and it could have been a sincerely gripping novel, yet the writing is extremely wishy-washy and I could not relate to the heroine in any meaningful way.I finished it only because I wanted to find out what actually happened at the end after sticking with it for more than 100 pages. It was not good enough to buy the sequel for me, and if it's not good enough that you want to know what happens in the next book I give that a 2 star mark.I'm an avid fantasy reader and this definitely did not fall into my qualification of ""Good Fantasy.""PS: In my reviews I try very hard not to give away any major plot twists or the ending of ANY book no matter how good or bad I found it to be."
1,Review of Kindle version,"I LOVE this story; the e-book? Not so much. It started off with some awkward sentences, a grammatical error or two, nothing that took my attention away from the story for more than a couple of seconds, so not enough for me to complain even a little. Then, just as the story is reaching the climax for the ending, these errors happen more frequently until the typos begin to need to be deciphered. It ruined that part of the story for me. Some might think that it's not enough to warrant such a low rating but I feel that it's completely unprofessional to have such ridiculous errors. I wouldn't recommend buying his for the Kindle; get a physical copy or wait for this one to get fixed."
2,Not worth your time.,"The characters in the book suffer in arbitrary and needless ways. The overall plot reads like a trite fairytale without the redeeming quality of being succinct. While the writing itself is good, it is not enough save the book, nor make it enjoyable."
5,Marillier's Best,"After reading this riveting, spellbinding novel, Juliet Marillier became one of my favorite fantasy authors. Daughter of the Forest is her best work.The elements of Celtic folklore, druid practices, and English/Irish relations is what fascinated me about this novel. The tale of unshakable determination and unconditional love is what made me fall in love with it."
3,"Slow, but intriguing fantasy","For those who believe Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time is slow, you've got to read this book. The pace is positively glacial. From pages 80-300 virtually NOTHING happens. There's tons of character development, but at points it's extremely dull.Marillier shows a lot of promise. She understands how a book is supposed to work. The amount of time she puts into her characters bodes well for future efforts. Frankly though, this book isn't very notable.I actually put the book down when I was 60 pages into it and thought 'Haven't I read this before?'. There's nothing strikingly original about the plot but if you take the time to slog through it all it reaches a satisfactory denoument.This book is aimed squarely at female readers. It's got a distinctly Merecedes Lackey-feel to it. If you like your fantasy chock-full of unrequited love and loaded with coming-of-age plots, check this one out."
2,Depressing,"I agree with another reviewer, finding this book to be dark, depressing and full of utter despair and long suffering. Definitely not my kind of read and would not recommend."
2,Don't be Fooled,"As compared to other books in the business of re-telling fairy tales, this one is disappointing. It comes across more as a shoddy romance novel, the weak-kneed princess whose life is a disaster until along comes Big Strong He-Man. I also wonder why the title refers to ""the forest"" because there is very little about the forest in it. Moreover, the so-called Celtic elements are very limited, and what is there is the usual castles, swords-n-horses foud in most fantasy novels."
2,Wow. wow. A histrionic bodice-ripper novel,"A weepy, man-worshipping, sorry excuse for a story.The author is a good writer but for pete's sake, she goes on and on about the gorgeous, gentle, well-endowedness of Lord so-and-so. It's enough to make me sick."
2,Snore,"I think that this very so-so book will have most appeal for persons that weep a lot and cry out in joy and pound objects with their fists, or are otherwise prone to hysterics. For most, this one will put you to sleep. Protagonist is a hysteric who puts herself in the face of trouble and waits for big strong men to rescue her."
1,Didn't hold my interest,"I love Celtic myth, and am very familiar with the Swan tales in all their incarnations. I don't think this one improved on the story, and in facr may have done some serious damage.The original tale did not have the soap-opera strong but mushy inside heroine, which did nothing to enhance the message; that devotion and love of family is worth any sacrifice. When relating fairy tales, it takes some of the mythic nature out to make it into the heroine's viewpoint only.I feel strongly that this book is overrated. It has a pretty cover, but the inside is not that good."
5,Phenomenal,"I have read many celtic fantasy novels, but none capture the heart of the characters involved so well as Marillier's poetic writing style. I have read this book many times over, and find it flawless. The whole Sevenwaters trilogy is brilliant, but in my opinion none of Marillier's later novels, (within Sevenwaters or her later series) can truly match this one. If you love fantasy, romance, history, Ireland, and deep tales of noble hearts, then I heartily reccommend this masterpiece"
3,Eeh...not stellar writing,"This is an interesting story but rather slow, not very developed and certainly not technically mature. However, it is an enjoying read if you just play along. If you are someone with high literary standards this will certainly not be a satisfactory read but if you can just enjoy it for what it is, then it is worth a go. This book can be quite tedious and the language can be very sophomoric but there are beautiful moments, too. Bottom line: its ok."
4,An enthralling and haunting tale!,"""Daugher of the Forest"" is a beautiful, haunting novel of love and war. The story is a retelling of an ancient Celtic fairy tale. The gutsy hero is the one who must restore her brothers suffering under a curse by a witch. She is an herbalist which provides an interesting view of ancient healing arts.The metaphor of tranformation sets the tone for this novel symbolized by the curse which turns the brothers into swans.Set in the background of ancient tribal warfare between Ireland and Britain, this books succeeds as both a fantasy novel and historical fiction.The ending of the novel hastily twists the plot into a romance theme which somewhat awkwardly adjusts the focus of the novel from a quest to a romance."
5,An enchanting story...,"I don't think I've ever fell more in love with a book. Juliet Marrilier weaves a story that you will instantly fall in love with. The plot is interesting, the characters so real, and the love and hate shine true.I recommend this for anyone over the age of 13, you'll fall in love with Sorcha, Red, and even Lady Oonagh."
1,wrong cover!,I specifically wanted the cover that was shown when purchased. The book that came had the wrong cover. I am not happy with this purchase.
4,Daughter of the forest,"The book itself was wonderful. Kept my interest from beginning to end. But towards the very end, there were numerous misspelled words that never should have made it to print. A great book and one I will finish the sequels. It a shame a book this good is flawed by basic spelling errors or neglect."
5,Re-reader,"Actually, I haven't read this particular volume. I was simply replacing my daughter's original copy which I have read a total of five times! Along with my handling and multiple reading by others in the family, it had gotten very worn, so much so that the magazines were falling apart. I decided we needed a new copy. So, the one I recently purchased hasn't even been soiled yet! I'm sure it will be used by all our family members!"
5,Still Dazed...,"Upon having devoured this book in a day and a half,I was positively bedazzled, mystified and hypnotized, though not without some overpowering sense of loss. For because of these alluring, real characters and settings, I'd myself unwittingly become a part of them;I felt, thought, and reacted as though everything, in some way or other, would directly affect ME.I think this is why I'd been so taken with Daughter of the Forest;though I very much appreciated the refreshing irony of a fairy tale having dark undertones, it was still difficult for me to fully acknowledge the way the story ended, with its beloved characters each going their seperate ways, so different from traditional happily-ever-after's.Whether I found this part of the story depressingly bleak or not, it still is one of the most enchanting works of fiction I've come across.I Could not recommend it enough."
5,Beautiful and Masterful!,"I was stunned that this was Ms. Marillier's first novel. She writes with ease and skill, her prose is graceful and beautiful. Sorcha and her brothers come to life on the page and their story, a magical retelling of the legend of ""The Wild Swans,"" captures the reader's imagination from the start. I can't wait to read the forthcoming books in this trilogy."
1,book thinginess,"this book is great as a first time read and can make you pull an all nighter to finish it. however, i've found that more times you read this book, the less brilliant it seems. i have a lot of time on my hands and i've read it 4 times, i think. i lost count.in conclusion, this is not a book you'll keep on your bookshelf for generations, AKA it'll never be a classic. still it's a good book, even with the historical holes and i recomend it as a light read. don't read it more than twice though or you'll start to feel sick.this book review makes me sound like a snob, but im not. really.im just to lazy to go back and rewrite it in a funnier, nicer, more down to earth style."
5,Best writer since Anne McCaffrey.,"I picked up this book used on a whim. I'm so glad I did. I wasn't able to put it down until the very end, reading it for almost a solid day. I will certainly be after more of Juliet Marillier's fantastic fiction. Already I have 3 more of her novels on there way."
5,Great,This book will make you laugh and cry. I loved it so much I made all my friends read it. Ive reread it many times and still cry. Read it!!
5,Beautiful Fairytale,"wow, I have loved each one of these books. Marlillier is a storyteller, unparalleled - the emotions of her characters are so lifelike, and the story so intruiging, you cannot put it down until the end. This is the first of a whole collection of amazing reads. I am very proud to have them in my library :-)"
3,"Dark, beautiful and a bit slow","Daughter of the Forest is beautifully written, but flowed at a slower pace than I would have like. The writing is very visual though. The book is full of magic and mystery, with a little evil thrown in. Daughter of the Forest is an entertaining romantic fantasy that retells the legendary Celtic fairy tale of the swans, the main character is a young girl named Sorcha who has six older brothers (who are turned into swans).I found myself skimming a few pages off and on, therefore I give it 3 stars."
4,Fetching!,"For a rather long book, I read it in a very short period (like 3 days). It is not demanding reading and the story is very entertaining. An evil witch, the unassuming heroine, the unexpected love interest, etc, the book has it all.A very pleasing and well-rounded story.Rating: 4 out of 5 starsSuggested With: Warm tea on a quiet night."
5,My favorite book this year,"And that's no small achievement. It's hard to believe this is Juliet Marillier's first book, so well is it written, and so powerfully affecting.DAUGHTER OF THE FOREST is a skillful, beautiful, heartbreaking retelling of the Celtic myth of the sons transformed into swans by their evil stepmother...and yet it is so much more. Narrated by Sorcha, the young sister of the six transformed brothers, this is as much a story of deadly ambition, battling peoples, and ruthless politics as it is an enchanted hero-tale in the Celtic tradtion, touched with supernatural wonder. It is equally as much a love song for the sacredness of the earth and a witness to the power and strength of family bonds and love without condition. I cried again and again, I held my breath, and sometimes I smiled. This one isn't just another knock-off of the ""Celtic Craze."" This story is magic."
5,"... don't mind the tears, for they are not sad ...","I discovered this book quite recently, and since I love swans, I thought, sure. I started it, the length of the chapters kind of made it hard to stop. I like to end a chapter before I put it down. I cried and sobbed. Her trials and tribulations are so tough and demanding. I found myself clamping my mouth shut along with Sorcha. Blinking rapidly to just read through my tears, not even thinking of grabbing a tissue, or laying it aside to wipe them. Not even caring how late it got, or if I was too cold from the aircon. Or reading through my lunchbreak without even touching it. I haven't felt like this about a book in quite awhile. Quite a find, and I can't wait to read the next."
5,A fabulous read!,"I loved this novel! I couldn't put it down. It was a beautifully written story and I found all of the characters compelling. I would have normally been quite sad when it came to an end but luckily, it's a trilogy! Can't wait to begin the next one. (There were a few typos in the Kindle edition.)"
5,Beautiful book,"I have only just discovered Juliet Marillier, and I really enjoyed this book. I will certainly be reading more. For a story written in such lyrical prose, I had trouble putting it down and devoured it over a weekend. Lovely."
2,Kind of average,"As a reader of good folklore and fairy tales, I found this a watered down, somewhat soap opera version of a very beautiful story. I'm not sure what all the hype is about; this isn't a bad tale, but it's nothing to write home about. I might read her next book, but only in paperback or from the library."
2,Blah,"The cover art says it all for this book: pretty in concept but gray and boring in execution. Anyone who has ever read a really GOOD telling of the six swans tale is bound to be disappointed by this retelling. Sorcha's narration is not compelling and the things that have been added to ""fill out"" the tale are joltingly modern.No."
3,I'm conflicted ...,"I agree with all the other reviewers. This book is great! The whole trilogy is great! I love the rising female fantasy writers because of the emotion they build into their stories. But what I don't understand (and maybe this is bacause I am a male) is why some of the up and coming female fantasy authors seem to be hanging on to sexually explicit scenes (or at least scenes with overly explicit descriptions and conversation) such as what one would find in a pulp fiction lust novel. Elizabeth Haydon is another such author who wrote a wonderful trilogy, a wonderful heart-ripping love story, but cheapened it with such imagery. Isn't it possible to have lots of emotion, reveal the evil side of humanity, and still keep it rated PG?"
1,Horrible!!,"I don't think this book even deserves a star. Yes it was good and the story was interesting, but she gets raped at one point, in detail!! I do not think that we need to lower ourselves by mentioning every detail of something like this. It is not totally necessary to the story at all.I am writing this because I wish there had been a review that I had read warning me about this. I want to warn anyone who wants to read this what is in here. If you feel like you can read this even with that scene in there, then go ahead. But I hope that this will protect someone who does not want to read anything like that.I just read this because I still love Fairy Tales and I wanted to read one about this particular one, which is one of my favorites. But that just ruined it for me and ruined alot of things for me.AND I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING ABOUT ME BEING A CHRISTIAN!!"
1,Weepy and ineffectual,"Fair writing, but the main character is weepy and ineffectual, wholly reliant upon Big Strong Men to rescue her. A pathetic character in an otherwise mediocre book. Note that this is basically a book in the romance genre rather than fantasy."
1,Don't be fooled,"As compared to other books in the business of re-telling fairy tales, this one is disappointing. It comes across more as a shoddy romance novel, the weak-kneed princess whose life is a disaster until along comes Big Strong He-Man. I also wonder why the title refers to ""the forest"" because there is very little about the forest in it. Moreover, the so-called Celtic elements are very limited, and what is there is the usual castles, swords-n-horses found in most fantasy novels."
1,Akin to other bodice-ripping romance novels,"Not bad writing but skip it unless you like sappy, weepy, romantic melodrama. This book should have Fabio on the cover."
1,Good Book Bad Binding - Beware of bargain books,"I bought this edition, the hardbound Tor one, for $5.99 June 6, 2006, at the Amazon special bargain price.Bad move.Since I had ordered another very long book at the same time - The Complete Books of Amber by Roger Zelazny, and read that 1200 page work first - I didn't start reading Daughter of the Forest till a week ago, the end of July. Within the week, the binding failed completely. The pages are all hanging out in various sized sections. I fear now that I may understand why it was a ""special bargain book.""Has anyone else had the experience of an Amazon bargain book falling apart?The book itself is interesting enough, but I'm too upset to write about it. Since more than 30 days have passed since I ordered the book, I can't return it, per Amazon's policy.If you like this kind of book, order the paperback edition only.DO NOT ORDER THIS HORRIBLY BOUND HARDCOVER EDITION."
4,Finally a book that's easy to understand.,I picked up this book as a recommendation and was pleased with that fact that its easy to understand. Its no Harry Potter but it really simplifies Neuroanatomy and Neurophysiology.
2,Tough reading,You have to be very interested in this stuff because it is very dry reading. Lots of good info though....if you can remember it all
2,What a waste!,"This game sucks! I was shocked to learn that even though you have a great console (ps3, xbox, etc.) you can get games that contain graphics from 8-bit designs. Unless you're a hardcore fan of the title, don't get this game. It's like they took a Nintendo game from '89 and allow you to play it on your Xbox! Where's the update? I live in the new millennium and I expect my games (even 2-d fighters) to have outstanding graphics..."
5,Great item,I would recommend this item to my friends. Woud buy thes earrins again. Loved it Would buy again. Thank you
4,Very cute!,"I don't have kids but I'm a big kid at heart and love SpongeBob! I bought this little toothbrush holder for my bathroom and I really like it. My only complaint is that the holes are not big enough to accomodate large handled brushes. Standard plastic grips like my brush are fine, but the fancy handled ones are a no-go. I would like to think that my boyfriend buys the large handled brush for their tartar control uses but I can't help to think he is doing it so he won't have to use my cute SpongeBob holder. LOL!!!"
4,SpongeBob SquarePants Toothbrush Holder,"As an avid SpongeBob fan, even at age 51 :O), I found this product to "" fit the bill"" as far as holding my toothbrushes. I had heard that the holes in this holder were to small for some of the larger handled brushes on the market. I found that not to be an issue. All of the adult brushes that I have used so far, fit in the holder just fine. The holes appear to be large enough to fit my needs. Just a great addition to my bathroom decor. It is hand painted, so it has that personal touch. Overall, I would give this product a BIG thumbs up!"
4,One Of Eshams Best,"An underrated album that is full of hot tracks. It's a little inconsistent at times, so I deduct a star. But, other than that, this album is a must own for: ""Nervous""; ""comerica"" and a lot of other great tracks, some of which are hidden."
4,Good,"I think this album is good, but it's just not as good as most of Esham's other albums. This album is worth getting, but it's not great or anything.MCLJono"
2,Hard to follow.,"This is the first book by Clare Curzon that I have read. It was okay, but I found it hard to follow. There were a lot of characters, and it took me about half way through the book until I was comfortable enough to know who they all were without having to stop and think. The storyline itself was somewhat unsatisfying. It seemed as though the police were running around hodge-podge questioning and requestioning people with no specific strategy or reasoning in mind. It was very confusing. It didn't have the organization that most police procedurals have."
2,"Good book, if you have a lot of time on your hands.","This is a good book and it is written in a nice way. It just ends up leading nowhere. A couple of things happen, but he ends up in the same place and with the same people."
4,A Comprehensive Source for Men's Clothing,I was a little surprised when I recieved this book that it is not quite as beefy as Norah Waugh's _Cut of Women's_ clothes. I was however very pleased with it's cotent. About half of the patterns seem to be taken from pre-1780s and the other half from 1840 on. This was a little disappointing as I was looking for some good Regency Jackets for my husband. There are how ever several frock coats that I can easily ajust the cut to to get the look I want. This is a great book as far as I can tell but I am still undecided as to whether it is worth the steep price tag.
2,NOT worth the price,"I was unbelievably disappointed with this book, especially given the price. The scaled down patterns are okay, but not especially usable if you really want to actually make the garments. I am the shop manager for a professional shop, and even our draper/pattern-maker, who was looking to expand her knowledge of pre-twentieth century menswear, found this book one step above useless. And it should DEFINITELY be noted that the book isn't really men's clothes from 1600-1900... it's more 1600 to 1780 and 1850 to 1900, and even those timeframes aren't what I would call comprehensive. It's printed on cheap paper and doesn't even have the feel of a nicely made and published book. Abysmal book and overpriced to boot."
3,...,"For that price, not very complete. Some info I was looking for were not find in this book so I'm a little bit disappointed because the book is really pricey."
3,Reefs to Rainforest screensaver,"Was not what I was looking for. Thought it was animated, but it was only a slideshow. Doesn't say anything about that in the item description."
3,The product is perfect. The shipping method wasn't..,"The cat came in a cardboard box with no foam or paper or anything. It was knocking around against everything during its journey to me and it shouldn't surprise you to know that it came badly dented.I was able to re-bend the flange ends, but you shouldn't have to do that. Buy locally if the price difference isn't that big.."
4,Does what it should...odd text set-up for Online class,"I have no real objections to this Laboratory Manual for the textDeutsch: Na Klar! an Introductory German Course. I have found that the set-up for this series of books is not very helpful for a first year German student. The textual material jumps around too much, throwing a lot of new words at you while trying to teach you the basics of grammar and understanding. The new and complicated words are delivered in an attempt to make the reading more interesting but really only succeeds in causing confusion and a lot more work as you look up each individual word/sentence when you're supposed to be learning the structure. I guess I would prefer a more Dummies approach for first year learning, but whatever. 8)"
2,Cheap materials used,"This unit is made with the cheapest materials: thin metal, thin wiring, an unstable base. I bought one and nearly broke an antenna rod screwing it in to the base.This one sells for $10 and it's not worth that. I went to RadioShack and bought their basic rabbit ears for $12. It's built like a Cadillac compared to this Yugo. And it gets 2 channels that this one failed to get.The base on the GE 24731 that I had was not the same as in the photo shown here.Bottom line: avoid this cheapie."
5,A Comprehensive Research Tool,"I was very pleased to find this book at Amazon, as the wealth of clinical research available, I found to be an invaluable tool for researchers, students or current practitioners alike within the field of Disability. The book is highly detailed and covers a wide range of topics in a succinct manner pertaining to historical paradigm evolution (Service models, pharmacology, legislation, criminology to name a few) right to current (mid-00's) research findings. I would strongly recommend it to anybody wishing to expand their knowledge-base on Disability research methods and as a service practice resource tool."
2,I didn't enjoy this one,"I like Marianne Williamson, but I guess I don't like her voice. On the other hand, she talks about a lot of things that to me don't seem related."
2,Not worth it,"Mine broke within the first hour of use, and I was being very gentle. These look good, but are very brittle."
3,A Little Light,"The wood of this Bo feels very light; I'm guessing it's made of pine or a similar wood. It also sounds hollow, but it's hard to tell. This may or not be what you want for practice, but be aware that it could break if struck hard enough. I'd recommend a heavier wood type; it'd be better exercise anyway in addition to being more practical."
2,Fragile,This Bo staff is heavy so i wouldn't recommend it for beginners but it is also fragile. I wrapped the middle part of it in electric tape for more support and grip and then i hit the ground in and exercise and I heard a snap. I checked under the tape and saw a huge crack right in the center. I would not recommend this for use or beginners.
2,Not hardwood!,"So I got my bo and was really excited, pulled it out of the box, looked like maybe red oak, but felt way too light. Upon further inspection noticed a large scratch (almost a gash) in the side and that it was odviously some sort of soft wood with a veneer finish. This makes it lightweight witch is kinda nice, but I was planning on using it in my martial arts class but now am unsure if it could stand the pressure."
4,My only Oldfield Album,"I first bought this album in the mid 80s and then it was on vinyl. Since then I have moved a zillion times and I really don't know where all those old vinyls are anymore. I have listened to a lot of weird music before, but this has to be one of the best. Family man is incredible, and so is five miles out. Buy it, if you are like me and not totally sold on the tubular bells concept, but actually like the synthesis of pop/oldfield (can't think of a more suitable description of this genre)."
3,"""Only THREE stars?! This just won't do for our little club. UNHELPFUL!""","Mike Oldfield cautiously dips one foot into the early 80's synth-pop waters whilst still clinging to his prog-rock life raft in this interesting, if somewhat uneven offering. The inevitable 20 + minute opus is surrounded by some poppier, more conventionally structured songs. In fact, I'm sure there are millions of Hall & Oates fans blissfully unaware that the blue-eyed soul duo's top ten hit ""Family Man"" was penned by Mr. ""Tubular Bells"" himself! The title song bears more than a passing resemblance to M's seminal synthpop dance hit ""Pop Muzik"" (and may in turn have ""inspired"" 1984's ""One Night In Bangkok"".... Not a masterpiece, but a well-executed and mostly satisfying listen."
5,Love it despite recording quirks...,"A wonderful CD. I've been listening to it over and over for days now. Have to say that the recording, though it presents an excellent 'live' soundstage, has it's own idiosyncracies. First, and not so nice, there is a ground loop hum in the recording -- the buzzing you might be able to hear (esp. at the end of the tracks) is in the recording, not your system. Second, it must have been a busy day outside the Teatro Olimpico in Vicenza as there is quite discernable traffic noise. (Turn the volume up on the second track, and wait for the truck to go by at 1:45). Still, don't let these niggles put you off, it's a classic."
4,Bobby Jones Golf Tips,"This is vintage Bobby Jones, no one articulates like Jones, the peerless expert. He has the ability to write in such a way as to make you ""feel"" that particular aspect of the golf swing about which he is writing. It is the concept of the ""feel"" via Jones that enables one to produce a satisfying golf swing and improve one's golf scores. Having said all that, it might be wondered that I didn't give it 5 stars, it is because some of the material is covered in ""Bobby Jones on Golf"", but I have five books by and on Jones in the hope I will discover a new gem. What this book does have beyond a few newly discovered ""gems"" is a photo sequence of Jones' classic swing. Not only do I enjoy reading Jones, but I enjoy reading about him, as in ""Bagger Vance"" and ""the Greatest Player who Never Lived"" both of which I enjoyed immensely."
2,Not what I thought,"I have used the Romance line for several years, but in the past always used the after shave balm due to very sensitive skin. It has become increasingly hard to find. When I ordered this product, according to the original description which appears to have changed now - I thought that is what I was buying. Turned out to be the liquid. I called the seller and they had no problem in my returning it, but could not offer the balm. I eventually decided to keep it, because I still like the scent. I do not like using the liquid, though and I guess next time, I will have to start looking for something else."
2,Good tenor? NOT!,"I purchased this CD based on the huge RAVES on this site and others about tenor Jose Cura. I could not have been more disappointed with the voice and this CD. This is not, in my estimation, one of the great tenors of our times. His voice is weak, and not a bella voce by any means. I cringed as I listened to the tracks on this CD. And the orchestration at the hands of Placido Domingo ""dragged"". I couldn't bear the pain anylonger. If a great tenor voice is what you want, do not buy this CD."
1,Yuk,"The sooner this tenor retires the sooner the world's ears will stop bleeding. His can only sing loud, and from soft to loud he sounds like he has his hand over his mouth. Pathetic dramatisation, awful vocalising, whoever told him he coud sing. However what do we expect when Domingo is his coach, he should have retived about 25 years ago, at least he is conducting so we don't have to hear him. Sorry, what an overstatement, conduct, wave a stick and pray for the best. Another run of the mill tenor with nothing special to offer.Don't bother, buy a recording to Bjorling, Corelli, or di Stefano singing these arias that is what singing is!! Look for another career Cura, perhaps as a foghorn, theres no talent need their."
3,Future superstar? Maybe Incredible voice? Afraid not,"I first heard Cura sing on Sarah Brightman's CD ""time to say goodbye."" His thundering voice really impressed me in these pop songs. But his singing of Puccini arias brought my hopes down. Part of the problem is personal tastes: I like my tenors to sound like tenors. Cura, except for his high notes sounds too much like a baritone. Even with his baritonal voice some arias come accross good. His Nessun dorma and the Tosca selections are good. But he sings everything in the same loud tone. And he doesn't put the characters emotions into the arias. This isn't a flaw if you have an incredible voice (like Pavarotti), but for Cura... P.S: Cura as Alfredo? Please, no! Cura as Nemorino? ?!?!?!?!??!! - that's like dusting fine china with a sledge hammer"
3,"Hmmm,","They call him the fourth one,or is it the fifth,whatever,i say wait and time will tell,his voice is nothing special, if this is anything to go by,the volume is enormous,(take that from someone,who was the seated at the back of a large theater),at times you get the impression that he is a ""closet baritone"",the one thing you cannot ignore,are his ""intreptations"", that X factor that domingo has,and very few others. An aside,i saw him sing othello in london ,he kept conducting the orchestra,turning his back to the audience,and showed an arrogance that bordered on comical at times,this irritated endlessly.Get rid of this seaside karakoke showing off, and he has the makings of a great artist."
4,José Cura - Puccini Arias,"José Cura's voice is positively enchanting, the purchase of this cd is well worth it!"
2,Fell off during snow storm,"I've been around cars for a lifetime. I am certainly aware of the process of changing wiper blades; it could not be more simple. This item was properly installed and I bought it through Amazon because it is particular difficult to acquire 13 inch, winter, replacement wiper blades.During one of our New England snow storms, the blade, literally, was launched from the wiper arm in the middle of an intersection. Consequently, recovery was impossible. Fortunately, I had saved the replaced unit which was not of the winter variety, but served its purpose.Bottom Line: I would NOT buy the product again."
5,gripping stuff,"historical fact mixed with historical fiction? Either way , it's an extremely good read , althought rather long . Ash ,the central character , makes a brilliant heroine . As does Flora , the groups surgeon , Who later becomes Duchess of Burgundy . The siege of which is one of the main plots within the book . If you've never read anything by Mary Gentle before I recomend this . Once started you'll have to finish it ."
2,way too short,"We love the full-size Walpilo Cervical Pillow, but the travel size is a very bizarre shape. It's like they took the full size and cut it in half. It's just big enough for your head if you don't move at all when you sleep. Not us! The measurements were on the site, but we paid more attention to the picture, which is NOT accurate. Be careful before you order!"
5,no more stiff neck,this pillow goes where ever I go. delivery was prompt and the pillow was perfect. I recommend this pillow for comfort no matter where you sleep.
4,Apply Your Creativity to Tags,"I knew tags were a big deal in scrapbooking, but I couldn't quite figure out how to make them and use them. This book solves those issues for others as clueless as me.The book shows techniques and materials making tags from everything (cork, CDs, ribbons, slide mounts, fabric, can lids, etc.). The techniques range from stamping, distressing, altering, painting, colorizing, embossing, and other ways. Some are a bit more cluttered or funky than I'm quite ready for, but all were interesting.Each two-page spread focuses on one technique. It shows a scrapbook page using tags, plus additional tags made in that way. Down the side of the page are step-by-step directions for using that technique.At last I have a use for all the odds and ends I've saved up."
1,"Waste, waste, waste!","When I purchase a book, I like to go through and find the layouts I would like to lift. In this book, I found one. ONE. I bought this book to find different ways of using tags in my layouts and found nothing. There was nothing innovative or too unique enough for me to recommend this book to anyone. You could find any of these ideas by just looking at the other books you have in your scrap library. Do not waste your money by buying this book. Anyone can decorate a tag like the ones illustrated in the book by taking the knowledge you already have and applying it. In fact, you could probably do better."
3,Vague description,The picture shows two pieces of chains on one tire. You need to buy two packs for your two tires. Descriptions do not point this out!
4,Good for Emergency Use,"I have several sets of these strap-on chains and have received good service. I wouldn't recommend them for regular winter driving, but for those occasions where I need to get up a glazed hill, or out of a shallow ditch, these will do the trick. Easy to install and remove, they provide added traction when something more is needed to get me back on my way."
1,Can make things worse,"I bought these as a backup whenever I got stuck in a snow storm and needed extra traction to get up our hill.Well, the added a little more traction but then they broke off and one apparently broke my break line when it came off.I now have Snow Tires that I use in the Winter. A MUCH better (and safer) investment."
1,pretty useless,"Didn't get me out of a small snow ditch. Technically it probably did make a difference, but not enough I guess. I was on the go again, as soon as I got a hold of a couple of people to push me out."
1,SLIP CHAINS,"The chain came loose after 1 mile. My tire size might be to large. You need to double/triple loop strap, I could only do it once. Also, you might need a wire coat hanger to wrap around the tire."
4,AAT Workbook,"I originally purchased this book by the recommendation of my therapist. However, since then I had the Gastric Bypass done and this book doesn't really apply to me anymore..well at the stage I'm at. I do have a friend that I will be sending this book to. From what I read in it though, it seems to be a very good book and seems like it would have helped me prior to surgery."
2,So Disappointed,"I bought 3 books on this subject this week, and this is the one I wish I hadn't bought. I am so disappointed in this book. I was expecting a true workbook, and there is no real plan in this book. There is a lot of interesting information, some of which is useful, but if I hadn't also bought The Seven Secrets of Slim People, I wouldn't have gotten a plan to actually do the work I need to do to be able to find out when I'm hungry and when I need to stop eating."
5,Awesome book,"Awesome book. My son loved it so much, I read it after him and loved it too! Cant wait to read number two!"
4,From the bottom to the top,"This is a children's series that doesn't try to talk down to kids. Instead, these books introduce new terms and techniques from the sport of climbing that even many adults have not come in contact with. This series does not try to make reading easy. It focuses more on the story and the adventure. I do have complaints about the series, like the fact that it is a series. The beginning of books two and three both have to recap what has occurred to that point in the story. Just make it one book so that you can have the flow of the story continue with out forcing the reader to reread. It also seems questionable that anytime the team of boys goes anywhere they are faced with a major problem. Yet, I understand that these were written for kids. Together this series cannot be as powerful as Harry Potter, but will help kids know the fun of reading. I can't wait to go climbing in the snow."
3,Everest; the contest,"In this book Dominic (a normal kid who likes climbing) and other kids are give the chance to climb Mount. Everest. They go through serios trianing , and competing. The kids who last the longest get to climb Mount. Everest.So if you like excitment and adventure, then this is the book for you."
4,The deadly climb.,"This book is about adventure, facing adversity, and suspense. As the competitors are being narrowed down for the four spots the intense level rises. Dominic is a 14 year old kid, who is not only the youngest at the camp but who is also the smallest, and everybody at camp believes the team leader is keeping him just for people to watch the show. Once the team is picked the four people were not expected to make the team but they did. As everybody believes the Dominic should not have been picked for the team, the team leader was glad at the end because Dominic saves a life even the team leader couldn't have saved. Although the book has Everest on it I was disappointed that they did not climb Everest, but i am anxious to read the next book.Written by Jack S."
5,Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa,The sereis of everest is the best one i have ever read!! The first one i read 4 six ours strate. now im on the second book.THESE BOOOKS ROCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11
3,missing bracket,One of the retaining brackets that hold the belt in place after waist readjustment was missing upon arrival. when i find another military web belt i will try to fit. The belt is good quailty
3,Interesting adventure story,"Does anybody remember those big old ""Boys' Own Annual"" books printed in England on pulp paper about 100 years ago? This story, ""Road to Paris"", would belong in those pages, with a target audience of adolescent boys. It's a romp, fun to read but really, some of the situations the lead character finds himself in are too fantastic to be believed. In fact, he lives a life filled with unique situations and amazing coincidences, and is imprisoned so many times that I lost count of the prisons, wounded a few times and still didn't die of septicemia... any mere mortal would have died of exhaustion and stress long before this story ends. But at book's end our hero is a mere 20 something, full of zest, and looking forward to many more years. Three stars for the historical interest: American War of Independence, US invasion of Quebec City, descriptions of France countryside and the Bastile, etc. etc."
1,Defective Kindle edition,"As of the date of this review, this item was defective. The first twelve and a half chapters are missing. Looks like a good book, though -- check out some other edition."
3,new song is good,"Aussie girl Tammin Sursok, of home and away fame, has moved into pop well, with her first single Pointless Relationship being an example. she has followed in the footsteps of delta goodrem from neighbours who has made it big in the pop world good luck Tammin. She's very hot too"
2,the far country,Great movie but poor picture and sound quality looks like it has been copied from a video.very disapointed with the quality of the dvd.
5,dantoad,"This production follows in the same vein as Nevil Shute's other block buster mini series--""A Town Like Alice"". Although on a smaller budget and a less grand scale as 'Alice', the movie captures the essences and emotions of Shute's supurb book. Having lived in Australia, I can say that I was swept back to a time in my life I will cherish always--it was that well done. Be prepaired for a long evening."
2,Meh,"When I travel to a non English speaking country I only need to know a few important phrases. This provides more than what I need and the organization of the presentation of words/phrases is not intuitive to my way of thinking. It's just OK. Nice that it's plasticized for durability, but could less tall for easy carrying."
2,Lacking an Implementation Perspective,"I felt that the book was lacking in details thatwould have led to implementation of some of thealgorithms presented. Often I felt that the mathwas not providing any insights into what was acutallygoing on behind the terminology.The code on the CDROM has virtually no commentsand was useless to me when taken out of context.I was disappointed in the end with the price/performanceof this book. It might be right for you, but flip throughit before buying!"
2,bo case,"The case works as a protective covering for a bo, but does not have any sort of straps for carrying the bo while it is in the case. If you are looking for an inexpensive bo case for traveling with your bo this case is not very effective. Mine was also bright orange and green which are odd colors for a bo case. It is a well made case, just not what I was expecting."
2,Two very serious flaws.,"This isn't a bad Carmen by any means, but there are three flaws, two of which are real deal-breakers, and two of which could have been fixed.The minor flaw may seem like nothing, but it was so easily fixed, and is so antimusical that I have to mention it. Acts 3 and 4 would have easily fit onto the third disc, so why BMG choose to split Act 3 between two discs.A more serious flaw is the acoustic. It's fine during the music, but the spoken dialogue is recorded with a completely different acoustic which is very, very jarring and distracting, and could have been mitigated.The other ""deal-breaker"" is Migenes, who was terrific on the screen, but on a sound-only recording, sounds hopeless mannered, unwilling to sing a single phrase without without the insertion of some bit of ""acting"".The rest of the cast is fine, if unmemorable. Domingo is his usual generic self; if you want to hear him, find a copy of the Solti recording with Troyanos and van Dam:Bizet: Carmen."
5,super genial,Produit parfait délais très bien resqpectés je recherchais ce proiduit depui ssi longtemps merci merci beaucoup
3,OK but big and expensive,"This is a somewhat over sized, over priced tome and to be honest ""Microwave Engineering; Passive Circuits"" by Peter A. Rizzi is probably more concise and more usable."
5,The Definitive Work,This book is the most complete reference to Microwave Filters and the like that one can find. It is a must for RF and microwave engineers anywhere.
5,Must have magazine for the poultry enthusist!,"Backyard Poultry magazine is a fabulous publication. Bi-monthly it arrives, eagerly awaited, in my mailbox. It is loaded chock-full of great color photo's, as well as black and white photo's; some photo's even sent in by their readers. Some of the features of this magazine include: question and answer forum; where a professional will answer your poultry questions, personal poultry stories, features about the poultry business, farm laws, poultry recipes, breed features and how-to features. One how-to feature a few issues back was on how to butcher your broilers, complete with step-by-step instructions with photos too and written in everyday joe language.One reason I enjoy this magazine is because of the wonderful variety and balence of stories and features. It covers a wide range of poultry interests. Another bonus is that the advertising doesn't swamp the stories."
1,Horrible manual,"Now that my truck has passed the 10-year mark I'm starting to have the squeaks, rattles, and occasional parts that need replacement. For my needs I found the Haynes manual to be generic and useless. Didn't even have the layout of the fusebox, if that's any indication. It's unfortunate they have sunk so low. I'll take another reviewer's advice and try Chilton's or save up for the dealer's service manual I guess."
4,Repair Manual,I found it to be very helpful. It had very good descriptions and illustrations and I would purchase another manual.
1,Garbage,I bought this mainly to address a 4x4 shifting problem. The manual says it covers 1997 4x4. Aside from a few passing references it is totally devoid of any 4x4 info. There isn't even a wiring diagram or vacuum schematic for the 4x4 system.
2,BLAHHHH,"Well, tisk tisk, how dare they change their tone to the point where you cannot still feel that this is the same band. I just had to listed to ""Of Love and Lunacy"" as I write this so I wouldn't be so sad. The new album ""Serpent"" is no where near as good as their first album. I don't know why great bands do things like this. Maybe they were trying to fulfill some contract obligation and had to get this out. Hopefully they will get their head out of their.... sorry guys, I just wished for something better from you. I will not buy this album, thanks to sites that allow you to listen before you buy. I suggest this if you still don't believe the reviews."
5,Give Me a Break,"A good portion of the reviews for this CD are way off! Does a band these days have to scream like maniacs every song to satifsy their un-appreciative ""metalcore"" fans? This is a sound, hard rockin', great effort from Still Remains. Geez, let these guys get creative if they want!"
4,Still Remains,This is one amazing band. Very talanted. So glad to see them getting back together. Great riffs In this EP.
3,ok product,"This product isn't what I thought it would be. Most of the pages are very similar (crinkly noisemaking fabric, etc.) so there isn't much variety to keep my child's attention. I was expecting different activities such as tying laces, buttoning buttons, fastening snaps, etc. This isn't really much of an ""activity book"" at all--at least not for a 16 month old. It may be fine for a child under 12 months."
1,Sheer pleasure?,It was sheer pleasure to close the cover of this book. Trouble is we only got through a few pages before doing so. It is not anything new nor is it refreshing in any sense of the word. This is just different words for the same things people have been writing for years. Writers are becoming a dime a dozen in the field of the occult. Unfortunately this writing is for those who may need psychiatry to deal with realism as opposed to imagination and fiction.
1,Absolutely the Pits,"When I first saw this book I thought Silver Ravenwolf haddiscovered Enochian magick. Instead, Silver jumped on the eventhen fading latest New Age fad, angels. This book is pure garbage and one of the worst books Llewelyn has ever published with one the tackiest covers since...well, pick any Silver Ravenwolf title. This woman claims to be a witch, yet here she is writing about angels. This woman just mixes everything together and makes up her own religion as she goes along. Some people just can't seem to break the ties to their religious upbringing. Even sadder is that many people have and willwaste money on this book."
1,where is my order,"i am writing to you as i have not yet received my orderwhere is it, either return my money or send me the product"
4,Universal Appeal,"Although uncomfortable for people of different religions to come together and realize that they have more in common than they think, Silver RavenWolf reminds Christians and Wiccans alike that we do share many beliefs and the existance of Angels is one of them. What's great about this book is that maybe a Christian will read it and think that Witches aren't cackling hags with green skin eating children...that they can be deeply Spiritual beings with strong beliefs in Deity! And maybe a Witch will read it and be reminded that not all Christians are judgmental hatemongers out to separate everybody and condemn people to their Hell. Maybe it's a long shot, but at least RavenWolf gives it a try. This is book is bold and daring, and reminds us of the good in two different belief systems.Bravo!"
5,Gloriously stirring!,"The book is truly a volume to compliment Silver's previous handbooks to Positive Magick Witches. I appreciated her thorough historical and lore searches to give the reader an even explanation of Angels through time. I have already incorporated several of her prayers and chants to call the Angels into my Positive Magick rituals. Once more, I can turn to Silver for extremely informative help in continuing to grow and learn in my Witchcraft! I would very much recommend this volume to other practitioners, be they Witch or no---Silver is inclusive of all beliefs. And the artwork is superb!!"
2,Eh...,"Organizational problems, or minimally train-of-thought. Writer's heart wasn't in the subject (or that's how it feels)"
1,"Um, no.","Ravenwolf has a habit of making things like Angels seem like your servants. I don't recommend this book, although I also don't recommend most Ravenwolf books."
1,Fluffy,"I don't know why another book needs to be written on this subject when it appears to cover the same information as in all the previous books by other writers. Somehow it doesn't seem that we need to keep spending money on repetitive books. Sorry it was a bad book, bad choice for publishers and a bad review."
3,very confusing,I've read her other books and found them very enjoyable but this one was very confusing. I kept putting it down. I'm not quite sure how everything fits together that she is telling you and ending up being very confused as to if this book was written for Christians/Wiccans or what.
2,Of questionable value,"This books seems to wander, as if the author could not quite make up her mind if she was a Witch, a Christian, or something only she can define. The book includes material from questionable sources, and of all the angel books currently hopping on the gravy train this fad has created, this is one of the weakest"
1,Old Songs,"""Fools rush in where Angels fear to tread."" Perhaps readers should know that before wasting money on this book, unless they happen to just like reading fiction. Treading in subjects where the writer appears to have very little if any first hand knowledge is foolish, don't you think? This writer seems to do that with alot of the books they write under whatever names they write them under."
3,I need another one,"After some use the copper bracelet lost one ot its magnets. Never felt when so I couldn't pick it up and glue itback to its place I quit using it for some time because of the green colored skin, as it should be, and then I gave it away as a present to a friend of mine having joint aches."
5,Using grado 325's to review,"Straight a/b between iPhone output & iPhone through this amp. Worth every penny - to the kind of person who owns Grado 325's. There may be better / cheaper ways to achieve the same improvement, but I don't have a ton of time to experiment. This amp sounds fantastic with Grado 325's. Ignore the haters about the look. It's a good conversation starter on planes. No one ever says 'I don't understand why you carry all this gear around' - they ask you how much it cost, because they want it."
1,Total Ripoff,Yeah it works. It looks like it was made by a third grader though in the 1950's lol. Some people have way too much money for useless stuff. I was thinking my headphones would be transformed. They sound pretty much the same just coming out of my receiver.Buy it if you want a slab of wood with 'GRADO' printed on it.
4,"Nice Collection, Pure Voice. Slightly Weak High Notes","I don't want to say more about her since she is too famours to introduce. I just bought two of her cds recently, which I had big expection for her.Undoubtly, she has beautiful voice and wonderful coloratura style, I was amazed by the flexiblity in her voice. However I was slightly disappointed by the weakness in her high notes. It seems that she never has strong high notes, and those high notes can't last as long as Dilber's or Organasova's.Sorry to say this to the pretty Sumi."
4,"Philip Glass, Master of Punk Rock!!!","Philip Glass is not to be reckoned with. His fireball stage antics would make G.G Allin blush. His solo career soared after he left his previous bandmates ""the Murder Junkies"". This album is no exception, For all who say ""punk is dead"", check this album out!!!"
5,Perfect Intro to Glass,"This is the perfect CD for people who are curious about Glass but don't want to spend $20 on a CD they may wind up hating. For $6.99 this is a killer deal. Bear in mind that many of the people who have given this CD a poor review are already familiar with Glass' work. We'll assume that the reader is not. These pieces are interesting,beautifully played,and do provide an excellent introduction to Glass' work.If you've always wondered whether or not Glass is your thing, or even if you've never heard of the guy, how can you go wrong for $7? I say slap down your money and give him a chance. I've played this as often as I've played any of his symphonies and soundtracks.Go for it!"
5,Theatrical and Accessible,"Albeit Glass is not for everyone (my girlfriend says he sounds like an alarm clock) but his minimalism (or more accurately, as he prefers, ""theatre music"") is accessible, simple and passionate. Glass provides marvelous music that sustains emotions for long amounts of time. His works are ideal for creative work (such as writing or painting) and I find that they are extremely inspirational and motivate me to draw or write sonnets."
1,More music for insects,"Intelligent insects, of course. In these extraordinary works, composer Glass combines notes to make chords, and chords to make progressions of chords. He brilliantly infuses the latter with rhythm, resulting in chords that move with a beat. There are also syncopated arpeggios throughout these works, especially in ""Arhnaten,"" the final 17:51 of this CD. These result from accents placed where they normally aren't. To this insect--er, listener's--ears, the off-accented triplets in track number eight are nearly boogie-woogiesque in their syncopation. In fact, by the time this CD was over, I had the strangest impulse to hop on the nearest tree branch and rub my antennae together.Please don't regard my one-star rating as a pan. Think of it as a single star repeating for infinity, like the three-note motives in these extraordinary works."
4,An excellent introduction to Glass' music,"I am a huge Philip Glass fan. At the same time, I realize that his work is not for all tastes. Working in the minimalist style, Glass' music is a unique sound experience. For those who are not familiar with his music, Naxos publication of Company, his Violin Concerto, and the overture and dance from Akhnaten, is a great, nonthreatening introduction to this composer. Company is a collection of four short pieces that are meditations on death, played by a string quartet. His Violin Concerto is the highlight of the CD, and the Second Movement is to date one of my favourite pieces of his."
1,The author did not do his homework,"This book could not have been written by a Seattle native - it simply contains too many errors and ommissions. Several items are mislabeled and the dialog for each picture is vapid.Additionally, it would not have been that difficult to match the ""now"" to the ""then"" photos. Many of the ""now"" pictures were taken at different angles and with the wrong lens.A good concept but poorly executed."
1,"Interesting, But . . .","Casually thumbing through this book at a book store one glaring error exploded off page 87. Although it is captioned as being a photo of Third Avenue, it is obviously a photo of First Avenue (note the Alexis Hotel).Look through this book while in your dentist's waiting room, but don't use it as a resource for your junior high school history project. Instead, you should use ""Seattle Now and Then"" by Paul Dorpat, which is a compilation of articles written and published over many years by the Seattle Times (AISN 0961435704)."
2,"Nice idea, poor execution","This book is a nice idea, but does a pretty bad job of execution. I don't know if it's just this one in the series or the whole of them, but I wouldn't buy them. In fact I'm glad I picked it up from the library to see if it was worth getting. There problems range from outright errors, a picture of 1st avenue labeled as 3rd which is almost exactly the same as one used of first avenue. Did the book even have an editor? Other issues are less erroneous, but overall more objectionable, including 90% of the modern photos being of poor quality, bad angles not matching the originals, or just uninteresting subjects. The only good point so far as I'm concerned are the old photos themselves, which is what I'm really looking for and have to imagine exists out there somewhere."
5,Excellent Educational Activity,"Suduko Jr. is a wonderful educational game that children can do by themselves. There are 4 levels of challenges and over 40 cards to do. It is magnetic and holds all the numbers and cards neatly in a small self contained box. It's durable, quiet and well organized. It teaches reasoning and logic. My two girls ages 4 and 6 love to do this activity. I even bought one for their classroom. Great product!!"
5,Fun game...,"This is a fun game. It starts out quite easy, then becomes more difficult. I like the grade, because for my girls (ages 4 & 7), they were learning the game for the first time. They were able to get used to it before it got too hard, and discouraged them. Oh, and ithe game also travels well (car/plan/restaraunt)!"
3,"Factual, But The Big Picture Drowns in Detail","In a way, there should be two documents. One would be an atricle-length story that focuses on the big picture issues. These are the science and engineering strengths (and weaknesses) of the Axis partners, the inherently impossible job of working together without an overland connection or control of the sea and air, and the differences that technology made to the war effort.The other book would have all of the excruciating detail.I finished the volume, but it was a hard read."
4,Informative read,The book was well written but at times a little dry. It was extremely interesting to read about the interaction between Germany and Japan regarding the exchange of late war technology. It is also interesting to note the role of advanced German technology in the ensuing Cold War with the Soviet Union.
1,Germany's Last Mission to Japan: The Failed Voyage of U-234,Sadly I didn't enjoy this book as it read like a technical manual vs. a historical story. I was facinated by the topic but couldn't force myself to finish the book. It was just too dry. This book would be great for someone doing a research paper!
1,Don't believe everything you read,"This book was written to appeal to anti-American sentiment. It is full of baseless accusations and insinuations. Coming after 9/11, it's timing couldn't be worse. The author has a most definite anti-American bias which shines through after just the first few pages, and continues with his conspiracy theories and other assorted nonsense. If you're an anti-American terrorist or drug smuggler type, this book is for you. If you have an ounce of grey matter in your head, this book is not for you."
1,End of a career,Unfortunately a misguided and a little paranoid piece of dubious scholarship. Johnson is supposed to look at the horizon of history and look at what shaped it. He rails against the imperialist bogeyman missing the boat that the world is a better place because of what the US stood for and against.
4,Just the old truth... for non-Americans,"After I read the reviews about this book here, I was surprised to see Americans consider this book thought-provoking or at least something new. If so, it's a urgent situation. This book talks about the plain old truth from the perspective of non-American, never a conspiracy theory. Non-Americans already knew and are undergoing what this book talks about.This book is well-written. Also, I praise that the author is brave because he attempts to reveal what American hate to see. If you think that it's something new after you read the reviews here, you have got to read this book. Face the harsh truth, and America will really become the country of justice, which it has never been."
4,"A high-quality, but a little one-sided, argument","Johnson's argument is persuasive. He accurately caught the point of the problems East Asian countries have. But he should not only criticize these countries' policies in the postwar era from the viewpoint of man of today, but show a counterplan that these countries had to, or could, adopt from the viewpoint of man of THAT TIME. I think there was few options available for Asian countries in the era to emerge from poverty."
2,Not bad but not too good,"The layout of the book is good with clear instructions and charts, but I personally found the designs a bit boring ,monotonous and repetitive."
5,just the ticket,"This hook has a hidden mounting plate, easier to install and looks better on the wall without exposed screwhead. Perfect for a narrow spot in the bathroom for clothes/robe."
3,Lulu ou bien Loulou?,"Les spécialistes se souviennent de la Lulu de Pabst, mais aussi de celle d'Anja Sija, dans un opéra-filmé qui ressortira peut-tre un jour en DVD. Et puis il y eut la référence absolue : celle de l'Opéra de Paris, en 1979. Pierre Boulez osait les trois actes et se payait le luxe d'une mise en scène brillante et intelligente et d'une interprte hors pair : Teresa Stratas. La représentation fut filmée en direct, et retransmise par la télévision, mais... pas de DVD! Il faut donc se contenter de la Lulu de Christine Schäfer et du Covent Garden. Décors minimaux et bonne interprétation, sans plus"
5,"Terrific music, inspiring performance","I am delighted with this recording. The music is beautiful and sensitively sets the story of Paul. It begins with a moving overture on the Wachet Auf chorale, and then the work continues with the story of the stoning of Stephen and Paul's conversion.The work is like Mendelssohn's attempt at being a Nineteenth Century Bach. He wrote it at his father's urging, and when his father died before its completion, he felt especially charged with the task of making it as great as he could, in his father's honour.The text is mainly taken from the New Testament, and consists of passages from The Acts of the Apostles, but also some of Paul's own writings, and Psalms.It is every bit as good as Elijah, which has become much more well-known.The recording features some superb soloists and a stirring chorus.Highly recommended"
5,Eternally Yours,"I love the Madaris Family. It is about strong black men who know how to love, cherish and take care of their black women."
5,One of the Best yet,"Clayton and Syneda, what can a reader say about them, only if you want to read a fantastic story, you better RUN like I did to pick it up. I hate telling a story to someone who haven't read it. So just go get all of Brenda's books. The Madaris men are the bomb and it just don't stop with them. Their friends are just as awesome. Brenda Jackson is an awesome writer. If you haven't been touched by her mesmerizing writing, I feel sorry for you. You must get all of her books, the stories keeps a reader going and going. And it's worth every moment."
2,What a disappointment!,"As an original Midnight Louie fan, I found this book a huge disappointment. The plot goes nowhere, the characters are falling into cliches, and there is no new mystery - it's like a contiunation of the previous books. I thought the last few books were stumbling away from the original wonderful freshness of the plot and characters, and this one just didn't stumble, it fell. I put it away and vowed never to read another one in the series. Very disappointing."
4,Love it! Love the series,Louie is a smart cat who manages to keep his human in line. They solve some strange cases. The series is located in Las Vegas.
4,Lovely,"This is a love story set in the drought striken mountain village of Old Well. He is obsessed with digging a new well and saving the village. She aches to leave Old Well and live in the city. Somtimes, like a Chinese scroll painting, the figures are minute against the landscape. Other times it is only he and she who matter. Within and without the story of their passion is the conflict between past and future, country and city, tradition and modernity, ancient superstions and government regulations. But always and ever, underling all, is a moving portrait of the eternal soul of the Chinese peasant searcing for the water of life, driven to survive."
5,Love the shirt.,"I get an amazing amount of compliments on this shirt, it is a conversation starter. Wore it Monday to the Doctors office two nurses told me separately how much they liked it. This is not a rare occurance either, anytime I wear my rat pack shirt without fail someone will comment on it, and how cool is that?Beyond the cool and unique quality it offers, it is also well made, feels durable, and is very comfortable."
3,Turning simple problem into nightmare.,Turning simple problem into nightmare. How difficult can an elasticity problem be in engineering? But these guys just have a way to make 1+1=2 looks like the most mysterious problem mankind has ever come across. No wonder everyone hates engineering and physics nowadays.
3,Nice setup Light if you have a tiny case,"The package is nicely filled the ussual, plus a on and off to be pounted on the back outside plate, where the ussual I/O setup is, I liked that alot for easy on and off. However the nice part ends here, the ""glow power"" of both cathode seems.... very low, it barely triggers the UV sensitive cables in my case, I own a medium one, for guys with lage or sever towers.. forget this setup."
1,very dissatisfied,"Highly recommend passing on this product. The light is so dim that any other light will completely drown out the UV. When I turn on my LED strip to its lowest settings. I cant even tell theres a UV light on in the case. I have a Large White case with an open window side panel. And was expecting much more of an effect. I think the sellers photo is misleading. How many people are going to sit in a completely blacked out room except for these two lights? Thats the only way that photo could be useful.I very much feel like i have been ripped off. I think people sell cheap junk like this because its more work to return than the troubles worth, and they know it."
3,uv lighting,the lights are not very bright. They need to be brighter. instead of ordering 1 set order 2 for the required affect .
2,This book is ok!!!,"About preparing for the test in 24 hrs is almost impossible, but the book & the Cd is almost up to the marks you can say, even though there are few mistakes indeed."
5,James Montgomery Band - First Time Out!,This band has the action and the drive! This collection of classics has a timeless quality that brings you back to classic lines and sounds that still obtain the thing today. I rate this a 5 and encourage anyone who is interested in the blues sound of James Montgomery or the tradition set down by him to BUY THIS CLASSIC!
4,Swinging Harp-Based Blues and R&B,"Finally released on CD, this first effort by the JMB is a good-natured blowing session that was unfairly ignored when it first appeared in the early 70s. James Montgomery could blow harp with the best of them and his harmonica workouts on ""Don't Do That"", ""Son of Jump"", and ""Train"" were hot enough to soften the vinal on the orignal 33 RPM platter and with the new remastering, I suspect polycarbonate will enjoy the same fate.Aside: I saw these guys open for Procol Harum in Detroit back in 74. They won the audience over with their musicianship and attitude. As we left the venue, I overheard a fellow concert goer comment that ""Procol was OK, but those other guys (the JMB) was really more fun"". Pick up on this lost bit of blues-rock....it is major fun."
4,An important reference work,"Scott Ross isn't my favorite harpsichordist but this is still a very useful set of recordings to have if you like to play Scarlatti. The price of the set reflects the sheer number of recordings - about 550 in total.If you don't play Scarlatti or you only knew him as a Baroque Czerny, good for technique and little else, then he's worth a closer look. With the volume of compositions comes music that is indeed exercises but it also includes music of incredible depth. There's no easy way to find your way around the recordings (or the music), you have to listen to pieces and gradually pick out sonatas that mean something to you."
5,Scarlatti at his best.,"If you love Scarlatti sonatas played on harpsichord, this set is all you could want. Scott Ross's interpretations are very appealing to me, in the style of Fernando Valenti though not quite as forceful. The use of four separate instruments adds a nice variety of sounds. This is an excellent collection."
1,Save Money - Buy Individually!,"I love these chewing sticks, but this 6-pack is a rip-off. They are the exact same product as the individually sold 100-count boxes on Amazon but more expensive. You can buy a single 100-count box for $2.19, so for $21.90 you can get 10 boxes - the same price the 6-pack is going for. I realized this before I ordered, but I thought because the label was green it might be a different product. It isn't. In fact, the label on the item sent was not even green.If you are thinking about buying these chewing sticks for the first time, do! They are great. Just don't but this 6-pack."
4,chewing sticks,Fast shipping for a great product. My son chews on these as he is trying to quit smoking and he says they help! A small investment on my part.
2,very superficial.,"This book gives a weak perspective on the topic. There is really nothing appealing in its pages, just a complilation of narratives with a weak analysis. If you don't have really anything to do this book will entertain you for a while, but I wouldn't count on learning anything from it."
4,Great Work Pants,I have found these pants to be warm and comfortable for working in the outdoor weather in Wisconsin. The reinforced pockets and hammer loop are a big plus. Plan to purchase several more pair.
2,Just OK,"This product has limited usefulness. You could easily get a similar amount of vocabulary from the internet, and the size is awkward for real world use.That said, it does cover the basics, and is laminated, so it will last forever.I think your money would be better spent on a phrasebook."
1,This isn't a book is a book unreadable!!!!!!!!,"It's a book report- slapped together by an obsequious, schoolboy, establishment, apple polisher. It is an appalling effort that reveals more about the sad state of current U.K. publishing than it does about its subject matter.There's no photos in COLIN WILSON Nature of beast, so all eager Crowley bio readers are advised to get Sandy Robertson's Aleister Crowley Scrapbook as a visual side-dish.Truly,it is apparent, ""no bad book shall go unpublished"". And no more truer, when it happens to be a dreadful, pious and nauseatingly moralistic account of the late great Master Therion (Aleister Crowley).A book not should be able the reader to understand Crowley and learn from his ideas.THE WORST BOOK EVER WRITEN!!!A BOOK UNREADABLE!!!!!!!!"
4,"listen for flavor, not perfection","I greatly enjoy this recording, not because it's done ""perfectly"" (whatever that means) but because Rostropovich brought out a truly Russian sound from an American choir. No offense to the late, great Robert Shaw, but the Atlanta recording is too pristine for my taste. It doesn't have the Russian character, not to mention that it DOES have Shaw's infamous (and sometimes infuriating) playing with tempo.There are places in this recording where a voice or two sticks out and a few places where the group gets a tad bombastic. But there are also moments of absolute sublime beauty, such as Movement #4. It moves me to tears even after the 250th listening. Overall this is a wonderful recording that makes me think I'm hearing essentially what Rachmaninov intended."
1,Very disappointing,"I often collect more than one performance of a work to compare performances. This CD broke my heart. It now serves as an example of what not to do. The singing is bad, the dynamics overdone, and the liturgical reverence is totally ignored. Most of the tracks are performed in a folksy dance-like fashion (which belong on a dance floor and not in a church), is totally the opposite of how Russian Church Music should be sung. The shouting on track 9 I found unacceptable. The alto soloist on track 2 is too operatic. The tenor soloist is a little better, however. About the best thing on the CD is the diction. To make matters worse, the negative for the cover photo was reversed, so the Holy Trinity Monastery Cathedral on the front cover is backwards! For a good performance of Rachmaninov's Vespers, I recommend Robert Shaw's recording."
4,Important tool for therapists,"This book is qpproachable about a topic that therapists need to have information about. It's a concise and informative book, and whether you agree/disagree about prescribing meds, it's still important to have this as a reference tool."
1,Caveat Emptor for purchasing Kindle version,"I have not yet purchased the newest update of this book, but was about to purchase it to read on my new Kindle when I realized that the edition for the Kindle is from 1994! That makes no sense to me, but I am glad that I caught it before I purchased. The low rating relates solely to the unavailability of a current version for the Kindle and the lack of a clear warning on Amazon's part regarding that.I would hope that Amazon will encourage the publisher to allow the latest version to be formatted and sold for the Kindle."
3,For the extremely intelligent,"I needed this book for a class in graduate school but found it to be so difficult and frustrating to read that I put it down after the first chapter. It's pretentious and Millon's writing is unnecessarily complex. However, if you are extremely intelligent and don't mind having to read paragraphs several times to soak in the meaning, this could be the book for you."
2,"Pharmacology, a Handbook for Therapists","A very biologically oriented text. The realm of psychology and biology is fraught with unanswered questions and exceptions to the rule which causes some confusion and a need for further research.It is very detail oriented and not clear in some areas as to the explanations of some of the neurological functions.A more cohesive work on the biology of psychological disorders and the outcomes of each drug with each disorder could be explained better for non medical students which many in the psychology field include. It leaves one with the question of whether or not the science can specifically identify the problems, exactly which treatment to use and the outcomes due to so many influencing variables involved.Even as a reference book for specific drugs for specific problems I would rather have a more concise description and less cellular biological details."
4,"Slow Start, But Delivers in the End","I had high expectations going into this because I thought Vol. 1 was fantastic. Unfortunately, the first half of this book was a letdown for me. The humor mostly fell flat and the whole ""She-Hulk as Intergalactic Judge"" storyline was pretty boring.The book really picks up steam in the second half. The whole Titania story is GREAT, we get her origin story and a big showdown with She-Hulk. The two halves of the book are related, so you can't just skip to the good part. You might be a little bored in the beginning, just know that it goes somewhere.In the end, I'm glad I ordered it."
1,Battery doesn't work,"Got the 1800mAh battery for my palm treo 650 and after installing it found that the battery simply will not charge, even though the charge light indicator is on. Have not gone about returning battery yet but it is a big frustration that it doesn't work at all."
4,Electronic Format long due,"I am still waiting for the publishers of this book to have it in electronic format for use in kindle and i-books. Until then, l will keep borrowing it."
4,Kindle edition needed for those of us in Africa,"I borrowed this book from a friend here in Tanzania who wanted it back within a few days of loaning it to me. The first 50 pages were thought provoking and I really would like to read it in its entirety... but alas, no Kindle edition! For wazungo who are actually in Africa, it would sure be nice to have an electronic version available."
4,Missons,"I would recommend this book to nonprofit organizations that are opperating in Africa, I bought this copy for our treasury of the board."
5,must read for anyone who works with Africans,The descriptions and the understanding outlined in this book are essential to understand the culture and thought processes of our friends in Africa. I have worked in Africa since 2005. It has helped me much.
4,Cultural Differences,"This book is excellent in pointing out the vast differences in how Westerners and Africans view money, borrowing etc. I now understand much more of what I have experienced as close African friendships have developed while working together building a new hospital."
3,African Friends and Money Matters,"Informative, but very redundant. Author repeats himself over and over. Everything in the book could have been written in two chapters."
1,The Un-PC,"Although being Politically Correct can mean that reality is ignored for the greater good, this book would not be deemed PC. However, it is cringingly full of generalities and embarrassingly full of platitudes about Africans. While trying to show that societal organization in Africa is so very different from that of the West, it actually just shows that poor people and rich people act the same there as they do here. And the book shows it over and over again."
5,Student Hardback Book,Book was current with the studies in Biology class.The context of book is exactly what I was looking forand enabled me to be on point with classwork.
3,an OK boilogy textbook,"The book is in an OK condition. Not as new as I would expect. Considering such a thick textbook for over a thousand pages with only $13, it is a fair price. But the CD is not in the book, not that it is critical, but I hope next time, this aspect needs to be mentioned when put on sale.Overall, it's an OK product, I am satisfied."
5,Fantastic,"The binding is like a nice cloth, instead of the typical crappy plastic. Very nice book. I spent $5 for this book, and it is in pristine condition."
3,somewhat satisfied,"The book was a little too beat up, but overall for the purchase price was satisfactory."
4,DO NOT BUY THIS EDITION (newer edition available),"This is great biology textbook with thorough explanations and helpful images. A plurality of high schools and universities will use this book for its core biology classes, making it a great resource even after the class(es) is over.However, there is a newer 8th edition, so PLEASE either buy that edition new/used or this one used (which is actually very cheap comparatively)."
4,Biology,"The book was nicely packaged in bubble wrap to prevent damages. The book itself was presented in a used, but very good condition for such a cheap price. In the end, I highly recommend!"
4,Great Book on Biology,"Biology was exactly as advertised, very big book came in great condition. Couple of minor dings in the cover; Definitely not light reading, you will want to understand Chemistry to get the most out of this book. I'm not done with it yet, so far it is been very good."
5,Great,"Good Condition, no scratches, pages perfect, slightly bent corner of the cover but nothhing big. Fast shipping"
4,Overall great service,The product was shipped in a timely manner as well as in the condition specified. Thank you.
3,Not in the condition they advertised,"There was a significant amount of marked pages in the book and the product key for the cd-rom was expired. This could just be luck of the draw not working out for me, but keep in mind that the product description may not be entirely accurate.Otherwise, the textbook looked new and you can't beat the price."
3,I feel for you if you have to take this class,"This class that requires this book is very HARD. I feel for ya. : ) The book is a good read, it goes into great detail for each topic it covers."
2,"This is a great book, but I have problems with the price.","I have spent literally thousands of dollars on textbooks, so I feel qualified - as an ex-student and publishing professional - to talk about this.This is probably the best comprehensive biology textbook on the market. But is it worth well over $110 a copy new? Of course not. Not when the publisher forces students to buy new editions with very minimal additions and edits, devaluing their old copies every few years.The authors are not to blame, although it would be nice to see them grow a pair and let the publishers know that this kind of price-gouging is not acceptable. With the numbers of copies this book has sold through its various incarnations, it is absolutely ridiculous to think that a $110+ pricetag is anywhere close to fair or appropriate."
4,"CD-Rom is good, book is kind of new","book is kind of new, CD-rom is good and I think it will help me to understand this book well.I like it:)"
4,Ups and Downs,"This is a very light bo, compared to the ash ones that I'd used before. It has a lot of *snap*, a lot of flex, and I like that. However, the finish was sort of rough. Once-in-a-while I got a splinter, until I'd used it for a while."
1,i2 sticks you with a diconnect fee,"It sounds good. It sounds cheap - but read the Terms of Service. They charge you $29.99 to ""terminate"" the ""service"". Thats same as charging $29.99 to connect you - only they hide it away and charge it at the end - or you can simply pay their monthly fee forever and never pay to terminate.Do you really want to give your credit card number to a company that hides its true charges?If you want to pay the disconnect fee then go for it!"
5,Good Dictionary,"Excellent for foreign speaking people. I bought it for a 15 year old who speaks no English. Once I received it, I was impressed with the amount of info included from day to day items, to detailed technology/tool pictures that display the names. Worth the money."
3,Becoming Madame Mao,An interesting though sometimes disjointed view of the turmoil in Mao's China. The reader is sometimes left adrift in the quagmire of recent Chinese history.
3,Issues with Perspective Shifting,"I really enjoyed the belnding of fiction, biography, and history. However, I had a lot of difficulty with the constant perspective shifting. I felt the frequency was over-done and that often there was no clear delineation so that I would go back and reread to figure out who was actually 'talking'. Still, the content was fascinating and the descriptive language was often poetic and lovely."
4,A story of survival.,"Madame Mao has remained one of the most hated and yet unknown figures of Chinese History. Anchee Min tries to explore this woman's personality and the reasons why she acted the way she did.As an opera singer/actress, she was forced to endure discrimination.However, she was able to acomodate herself to the social and political changes that affected China during that period of time. She managed to survive. Was she acting purely out of personal ambition or was she really in love with Mao? Her story is full of surprises and her ending is extremely sad.A good novel that brings us to the world of a most controversial character."
3,Good read,"I read Empress Orchid before this one, that book was my first Anchee Min novel. I can't say that this book is as good, but it's still a enjoyable read with Ms. Min's fluid writing and wording. It's a fascinating if somewhat fictionalized look into the life of Madame Mao. If you are a fan of Anchee Min, you should enjoy this book, but if you've never read Anchee Min before, start with 'Empress Orchid' or 'Red Azlaea'."
3,The white boned demon.,"Though Ancee Min's novel is ambitous in its scope, it fails to convey the horrors of the Cultural Revolution. The book best illustrates the bitter rivalry between Jiang Ching and Liu-shao-chi's attractive wife, Wang-Kuang Mei. I have to admit I found this book disappointing because I thought Min's earlier book, Red Azalea, was one of the most moving personal accounts I have ever read. Incidentally, Jiang Ching actually comitted suicide while awaiting execution. She was not executed by the communists as your review claims."
4,Becoming Madame Mao,Another wonderful book by Anchee Min. She has such a style of writing that I felt as though I was in China living this story with her. I have found all her books fascinating and very readable. She makes history more life-like.
1,"Vapid, pretentious and oh so ""Artistic""!","Seems Ms Min thought that the way to fictionalize this complex personality of Madame Mao was to write one paragraph of history followed by one of ""fiction,"" i.e. some internal monologue that editorized the ""facts."" The result is awkward and offensive. Ms Min assumed that the readers are: 1) not knowledgeable about the recent history of China; 2) cannot tell fact from fiction. Worst of all, the voice of this ""fictional"" character is flat, there are no insights into the external experiences. The voice of this book sounds exactly the same as Ms Min's other works. The pretentious tone is really a put-off. Like one of the reviewers said, you won't learn anything you don't already know about Madame Mao even if you had only read a few articles about the Cultural Revolution in any news magazine.If you want history, read the list of books at the end of the ""novel."" If you want a good story set in an exotic country, read someone else."
5,Solid brush,Solidly constructed brass brush perfect for brushing off excess wax after a hot scrape or smoothing down P-Tex repairs. Wood back is solid and bristles are rugged. Seems like it will last a long time.
5,Fast Arrival,"This brush for waxing skis arrived very quickly and is exactly what I needed. Although I have not used it yet, I am sure it will be a big improvement over what I was using previously."
1,Not a pleasant book for anyone who cares about animals,"This book is not for anyone who loves cat and is looking for a collection of heartwarming cat stories. It is depressing and I found some of the stories to be outright cruel. If you are looking for a nice collection of cat stories by a veterinarian who writes fondly of cats, I suggest James Herriot's Cat Stories."
2,Too many dead cats,"Some of the stories are fairly good. However, many are depressing, or worse. Do you really want to hear someone describe how his cat gets weaker and weaker and finally dies as he intentionally starves it to death? There are better collections of cat stories out there."
1,A pointless and disgusting book!,"If you are an actual cat lover, don't waste your time! Beginning with Michael Rosen's 19 page introduction, which was unnecessary and made no point, to the depressing short stories, which were so similar as to make me feel that they were all written by the same author, it was not worth it. All of the stories involved either a dysfunctional human relationship or a dysfunctional human living alone, and the cat or cats involved (all of them being cats who were left or let outside to roam) either disappearing or dying. The cats in every story were secondary or barely mentioned at all, plus the stories ended either on a very sad note or with nothing resolved. I actually did not read 5 or 6 of the stories, I was so disgusted by then that I couldn't bring myself to read any more.The pictures and cartoons, while enjoyable, had nothing to do with the book itself, but I guess they fit the overall theme of the book, which was pointless."
1,Sad and Sometimes Hateful Stories in This Book,I purchased this thinking THE COMPANY OF CATS 20 Contemporary stories was about people loving and taking care of cats and/or how people/cats/other animals got along. The book is depressing. It reads more like short horror stories about what happens to cats. I completely agree with the other reviewers who gave this a one star rating.
1,I hate to give this book 1 Star,This is a disgusting book and should be pulled off the shelves at Amazon! It is not worthy of even being offered for sale. I would use it to start my fire in the fireplace in my home.This is a cruel look at how some cats are treated. I cannot find one redeeming thing about it. Don't buy it!!!!!
1,Pls do not read this book.,"As if we don't have enough animal abuse in the world today, this sick demented person has to write a book like this? For what purpose?DO NOT read this book, do not buy this book. Do not give this person money for writing this sick stuff. Thank you."
2,Looks good but doesn't mount securely,"I liked this bulletin board for it's nice stark black look. But the mounting hardware it comes with want you to stick it to your wall. I don't like adhering anything to my walls, it's impossible to clean that stuff up without having to patch and paint the wall. The only other choice to mount the thing flush was to drive screws through the corners, another rather sever solution for a small bulletin board. So ours is hung somewhat loosely from 3M removeable hooks. We'll probably replace this board with something that hangs more easily and nicely."
1,Do not waste your money!,"These do not fit my stove properly, and so the job they are designed to do is null. The spills will still get under these ill fitting pans and you will still have to scrub your stove. Also you will have to scrub the pans, they do not clean up easily."
4,Range Kleen P-400 Square Gas Drip Pan,"The drip pans did not fit my stove but I sent them back for a refund. If they did fit, they would have been nice."
2,scarface good but the homies sucked,"i bought this c.d. thinking it would be like the geto boys foundation which was off da chain, but this c.d. was wack. the first four songz was good but after that the homies messed up the whole damn c.d. i was bought to buy this and download juvenile reality check but juvenile's c.d. was way!!!!!!!!!!!! better than this. truly i'm pissed i wasted my money if i was you i would download this c.d. because i wish i did and i'm a big scarface and geto boyz fan especially the old skool scarface and geto boyz but this c.d. was wack scarface was good but the homies was wack."
1,scarface sucks theese dayz,"this is the worst scarface record to date weak beats,the homies suck.what happened to the original homies from the old rap-a-lot days.get the first my homies but dont buy this crap."
2,What Happened??????,This cd was garbage the only song i liked was street lights and that;s just because the chorus was ok. i bought this cd because the source gave it 4 out of 5 mics. it was just garbage. after i bought it i gave it to my brother and he did not like it either
3,A Good Album from Scarface,"This is another good album from the dark and cool scarface, although mike jones & petey pablo shouldn't be on the album, but the songs are smooth, the lyrics are darker, the beats are stronger and the cover is nice.This is a cool and decent album."
3,susan,book was in fair condition; it was more damaged then i thought it would be. it was listed as good.
4,Jazz transcribed to text and illustrations,"A determined, jazzy cat tries to, and finally succeeds to, make music in a dog-run city, letting the reader see the importance of persevering even in tribulations. The impressionistic, curving illustrations that bleed to the edge every page, as well as the beat poem rhythm of the text, flow together to give the reader an understanding of what jazz is about: improvisation and expression of feelings. Even the placement of the text itself, which sometimes swirls, sometimes indents, and sometimes changes fonts, suggests the unpredictability of jazz music."
3,gift,cannot review this as it was purchased as a gift. I have never seen or used the product. Sorry about this.
5,Very Nice Cat Carrier,"This is a very roomy pet carrier. I could probably get both my cats in it, but I bought one for each of them. Has a nice fleece bottom and cats can see out sides and ends. Has a nice pocket on back."
4,Did the job,"This carrier was great - successfully transported the family's 15 lb cat on two airplanes for a total of over 1000 miles. It was a little small, but the cat was comfortable for the majority of the trip, especially once the ""Rescue Remedy"" solution kicked in. [Search for this if you're traveling with your pet - it really works!] My only caution is that if your pet has front claws, they may be able to rip the mesh to shreds and escape, but this was not a problem for my de-clawed cat. Overall, I am pleased with my purchase and would recommend this to others."
4,Nice carier..,I used this to pick up my 8 week old Doberman in Maryland and fly back to Minnesota.. It was the perfect size for Northwest Airline's requirments. Fit under the seat.. nice quality
3,Not sturdy enough for us,"We just brought home a new cat from a rescue and in the span of about 15 minutes she tore a hole through the mesh that was almost big enough for her to stick her head though. Luckily we were almost home. So, now I'm shopping for a hard-sided case.We did use this carrier with our last kitten without problems and the fact that it collapses for storage is nice."
3,Not as good as the hard cases,"If a cat tries hard enough, he can break out of this. It's happened to me not just with my own cats, but with my sisters as well. It's best to stick with the bulky plastic carriers for safety reasons. I find that the cats in those don't get as worked up and can't escape."
3,Collapsible mesh pet carrier,This is a good size for my 13 lb. cat. The only downsize on this product is that it's not too sturdy because of the mesh fabric and the carrier being soft sided.
1,Wrong Size,"The pet carrier itself was fine, except for the fact that the product that arrived was slightly larger than the dimensions provided with the product description on the website. I had to return the item because the size was slightly too large for the airline I plan to fly. If the dimensions on the package would have matched those in the website description I never would have purchased the item in the first place."
2,beware of escaping cats!,"My cat generally does not travel well, even on short trips to the vet. I got this carrier because I liked that it didn't scream ""cat carrier"" and had a convenient shoulder strap. It also straps in well in a car. However, the mesh is very rippable for a cat with claws (or persistent teeth). My cat managed to tear through it and escape within 5 minutes of getting on the highway during a 5 hour move. I switched his carrier with a larger, hard sided one that he could move around in easier, and he immediately settled down. Consider that this might not be the most durable carrier if you have a pet with claws."
3,"Dog loves it, but poor quality","Our dog loves this bag - we put a soft blanket inside and the dog jumps into the bag as soon as we take it out of the closet. However, the main problem is that the braces holding up the structure in the upper part of the bag broke out of the fabric they were enclosed in after a couple of months of infrequent use. The dog weighs just 9lbs and the bag couldn't hold up - can't imagine how long this bag would last with a heavier pet (the description claims: ""Appropriate for smalls dog and cats up to 22 pounds."" False.) We tried to tape the braces back together, but that didn't work and the bag can no longer be used, because the sharp parts inside are dangerous to the dog. Too bad; he really liked the bag."
1,Ridiculously unsafe. Zipper broke - my cat could've ran away!,"This carrier is very fragile and not safe. I zipped my cat in the carrier then the next thing I realize as I'm at the airport, there was a huge opening from the zipper!!!!! Thankfully I was able to bring the zipper back and re-zip it. I would've lost my cat if I was not able to get the zipper working again. If you're tight on money and have to rely on this, please please PLEASE get your cat/dog a collar with your phone number and if possible a microchip as well since collars can be finicky. My cat didn't do it, but I can see a very frantic, scared cat nudge it's way from the top of the carrier because it's just ""secured"" by velcro.If possible, spend $20 more on something else to keep your pet safe. Your animal is priceless and if spending an extra $20 to save it from escaping...do it."
4,Great for flying with pug,"I've used this for flying with my pug (in cabin). She is 23 lbs and *just* fits. It is the absolute largest carrier that most airlines will allow. The carrying handles and strap are really convenient depending on the situation. It is well ventilated so my pug always has plenty of airflow. The only minor complaint I have is the clips for the shoulder strap don't seem all that sturdy, but they haven't broken."
4,"Worked, but beware the zipper","I successfully transported my cat across the country in this carrier. She's a fairly large cat, but she fit comfortably into this, it met the airline guidelines, and it was easy to carry. The dual-entry points are a nice addition: it's much easier to load an angry cat from the top than to shove her in from the front.But beware. Just as we had loaded her up and were about to head out the door, she somehow got the zipper free at the top and jumped out, beginning a frantic chase around the apartment. I ended up twist-tying the zipper together to be sure that she wouldn't escape in the middle of LAX or worse. I'm not sure if it was user error or a design flaw, but be warned that it happened."
3,Teenage Shutdown: Things Been Bad,"Not quite as memorable as most volumes of the Back From the Grave series, but pretty noteworthy. Your basic 60's garage rock from bands of whom the world has never heard. Some lacking material, but the good stuff is very good. Buy this after, and only after, you have all eight (as of this writing) volumes of the aforementioned Crypt Records series."
3,The complete Republic is available on CD,"I'm glad a previous reviewer mentioned this product was a abridged audio of the book. This CD does have a reasonable price. The complete book is on a different CD. The other CD seems unabridged, but I haven't compared the text line for line. The Complete Plato's Republic is the audio version of the translation by Benjamin Jowett. It won't turn up in a search of ""Music"" like this version did. You have to go to the page for the book, look at where it says ""Also Available in:"" and look for the link that says ""Audio CD"". The price for the unabridged version is $125, but you get 10 CDs. Each of the 10 books of the Republic has its own CD, each over an hour long. I love listening to the Republic on CD[..]I'll try to add the link here as well:Plato's Republic (complete)Enjoy!"
1,really bad,"""listen and repeat....listen and repeat.....listen and repeat....listen and repeat....listen and repeat....listen and repeat....listen and repeat.....listen and repeat....listen and repeat....listen and repeat....listen and repeat....listen and repeat.....listen and repeat....listen and repeat....listen and repeat....listen and repeat....listen and repeat.....listen and repeat....listen and repeat....listen and repeat...."""
4,A French view on a Spanish Composer?,"This recording is very clean and exceptionally performed by the Maestro Ross. There is only one little sin: The style sounds more French than Spanyard. If you had no notice on these pieces, you could think that you are hearing to Couperin instead of Soler. Perhaps Mr Ross should make a travel to Spain to feel the character of it's people."
1,Low-Quality Canvas Eyemask,"Definitely not a ""satin"" eye mask. This product is made of cheap canvas, and is poorly produced in China. Much lower quality than expected, I would not recommend this item."
2,Okay qualitiy,Light weight pretty much means cheap. This mask was hardly worth the price. shipping was on time. Serves its purpose. not especially comfortable or luxurious.
1,Awful,These masks were grossly overpriced with the shipping and handling but I would have accepted that if they were nice. But they are awful. That are made from some kind of cheap material that feels like crunchy plastic or paper on your face and the material makes your face sweat. So if you are looking for a comfortable relaxing sleep stay away from these masks.
1,BEWARE!!!! THIS IS FAKE!!!!,"If you are looking to buy music from the original ""Dream Girls"", the original SUPREMES, avoid this one! These ARE NOT the real Supremes on this CD. The REAL Supremes on the REAL ORIGINAL hits, are: Diana Ross, Mary Wilson and Florence Ballard, and then Cindy Birdsong. These low budget sounding recordings were made by replacement Supremes hired by Mary Wilson in the 70's, and a few NEVER-WERE's!!!!! Don't buy this, don't be stupid. If you want to hear THE REAL THING, make sure Mary Wilson, Florence Ballard and Diana Ross are singing on them. Don't be fooled by these fakers!"
1,NO Stars for Karaoke Flos Phonies,"Too bad ""no stars"" isn't an option. What an unforgivable insult. Amazon as seller, let alone ""American Legends"" label as distributor should be ashamed.None of the semi-legendary ladies featured on the photo are inside. To make matters worse, they sing (if you can call it that) to what sounds, at best, like a cheap karaoke track of old Supremes classics that I doubt would get very far in ""those"" clubs.I wouldn't even line a litter box or birdcage with this travesty. Didn't The Flos learn anything from the failed ""Return to Love"" tour of 2000? Apparently not. At the very least, the estate of Florence Ballard should glean some financial reward for the use of her name in their stupid acronym."
2,Disappointing,"I was rather disappointed with this book. Based on the title, I was expecting it to focus more on physical features. Instead, the focus of the book is mainly on the ""tradition"" clothing of women in various cultures. Even then, it is more an explanation of how the clothing is worn rather than how to draw it. Only the first chapter truly deals with physical features and quite frankly, if the tones used to denote skin color weren't there, you wouldn't be able to tell the difference between one ethnicity and another. Just look at the cover. If it were b/w lineart, you could not tell which girl is supposed to be which ""race"". The book's content is pretty much the same way.So... while nicely drawn and having some wonderful examples of different cultures' clothing, the book really has very little in the way of ""How to Draw... Girls from Around the World."""
4,Great Book,"For those inspired artist that want to expend your horizon with different types of culture around the world, this is an excellent book to own. This book will give you the manga version on how to draw bishoujo in diffenet cultures."
3,"It's okay, but not great","The style of manga drawn in this books is out dated. The bodies dipicted in this book are freakishly out of porportion. A lot of the pictures were done very sloppy (like if am untalented 10 year old showed you the picture and said she drew it, you would believe her).BUT ignoring the bodies and faces, the hair and outfits were well done. And if you practice manga that is not learned from this book, but use the outfits that are done in this book, then it is recommended.Please note that the outfits are not based on modern girls from around the world, but rather traditional outfits."
4,Around the world,"This book is very good, if you like to draw peoples around the world. You learn how to draw hair, body, face and clothes. You also see people from other countries(That finnish girl isn't very good, 'cause they don't look like that! And that clothing is veeeery old. Nowadays no one finnish person uses clothes like that. I have been in Finland about 13 years and I know!) However, very good book. There are 'few' naked images so maybe this isn't good buy for 5 to 11 year-olds!"
4,It was really helpful,I always wanted to draw manga's and I never was really good at it until i got this book it was really helpful. It showed me different ways to draw different body parts.I borrowed this book from a friend that just went to japan. And now I decided that I have to buy it!
5,Excellent!,I don't think I can praise this series enough.I was so happy when I found a book like this.Exclenet for beginers and others who have drawn longer.
2,So So,"It was okay at best. While the message was thought provoking, the acting just didn't seem to support a good show. Had I seen it before I purchased it, I would not have purchased it."
1,Bad made for TV movie.,"Good in theory but bad in publication. As a side note, she kisses a man who previously yelled violenty at her? Not a good model for young girls in choosing men."
1,Crappy Remake of 1978 Movie,"Starting with the Off Key Singing of the Main Title This movie missed Its Mark. The Original trailer for the 1978 movie being shown on the previews really drives the point home. It appears to be a low-budget Canadian remake of the 1978 film. The burning question is ""WHY BOTHER?"""
2,All previous reviews are for the original - Amazon's error,"The following reviews are for the original, not the 2009 remake. The new movie is a snoozer, so beware."
3,Good Family Movie,"After reading many of the reviews, I almost passed this movie by. I am a fan of the first Ice Castles so decided to give it a shot. I think the remake was well done. Yes, some of the backstory was omitted or slightly changed, but I did appreciate the transformation out of the 70's into the present.The acting was not exactly top-notch, nor was it in the original. The storyline still on the quirky side, but the skating footage is excellent and I still find it to be a good family movie!"
1,Doesn't actually ship,"One star is one too many for an item that never arrives. ABSOLUTELY DO NOT believe the 1-2 Days shipping for Brussel's items. I ordered mine as a gift weeks ago, and it still has not shipped. Amazon refuses to cancel the order, they say they cannot even contact the vendor (Brussel's) to obtain the shipping status or cancel with them, and they keep breaking revised delivery estimates. These delivery estimates come in the form of emails from Amazon to which you cannot respond...it's a send-only address. So if you order any of these, you'll be kept hostage because you cannot go on vacation or trips since the tree will die if it is left in a shipping box and you're not around to open it. Amazon says they will not accept returns unless the item is in its ""original"" condition. It's completely absurd and fodder for a dispute via your credit card company."
1,Pulled off day old paint,Don't use this on painted surfaces of any kind. You will end up with numerous holes and just have to paint over again.
1,Total failure,"Wow, this product totally ruined my wall. When I took off the tape it took all of my paint with it. Complete failure to work! This product not only failed to perform it's job it also ruined my wall! DO NOT BUY!"
2,tape me to the limit,"We purchased this tape when we re-painted three rooms in our house. I researched the product and was really impressed by the safe release feature. I methodically taped-off all the rooms and proceeded to cut-in and paint the house. When I went to remove the tape several days later, I noticed that there was a significant amount of bleed-through. This meant we had to go back and cut-in all over again. Instead of saving time, it actually took us twice as long.After catching a Home Improvement show on T.V. I discovered what went wrong: When using this tape you must remove it as soon as you finish painting the area (while the paint is still wet). You must also use caution and brush from the tape to the wall, not the wall to the tape. If you brush upwards toward the tape, some paint will leak through underneath.It would have been very helpful to know this BEFORE I used this product.If used properly, this product does work; however, if you do not know its secrets....look out."
2,Only for certain applications,"This will indeed ruin drywall and pull off paint, particularly if the previous paint job was done over dusty drywall. It is great for taping woodwork,however.3M makes a Safe Release tape for Delicate Surfaces. That is THE One to use on painted drywall surfaces."
2,too little for too much,"Facing the chore of painting french doors I tried this tape to lesson my prep time. Unfortunately, 2 roles later only half of the panes were corner masked. (10 light doors = 40 panes X 4 corners =160 tape corners needed to paint.) Also found the perforations between tape sections leaves paint dots. Tape pieces are too big. Since you still need to tape between each corner, might as well make them half the size and get more corners from a roll. On the good side, when no perforations painted, tape did not bleed paint and came off clean."
5,Great painters tape for corners,Very good tape for corners. We used it for painting French doors and it saved a lot of time.
5,"Used widely in professional applications in commercials, movies, etc.","Don't let the low price put you off. Great stuff to add to websites, tag lines, power point, greeting cards, commercials, and so on and so on."
1,"If you have a strong dog, don't buy","The first time my dog pulled on this, the plastic joint between the ribbon and string broke. I tied the ribbon to the string. The next time the dog pulled I pushed the stop button; the stopper striped out. My dog is energetic, but only weighs 40 lbs."
5,"The best ""Italiana"" available on record. Period.","Fortunately, this was my first choice of ""Italiana"" Horne is at her best, for real (as always). And Ramey as Mustafa delivers one of the most beautiful lessons of how a bass should sing a buffo role. Unfortunately it's a rare recording so if you see it available, order as soon as you can. And stay clear form the Alva/Corena one."
2,Rossini - L'Italiana in Algeri,The libretto was only in Italian. We expected the libretto to be in both Italian and English. How does one enjoy an opera with a non-english libretto. We are not very literate in Italian (in fact - not at all).
5,Country Angels Vol. 1 - Karaoke CDG Songlist:,**The Track Listing above is missing a song**Contains 8 Songs With AND Without Lead Demonstration Vocals (16 Tracks Total).1. It Wasn't God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels - Kitty Wells2. When The Fallen Angels Fly - Patty Loveless3. On The Side Of Angels - LeAnn Rimes4. The Guardian Angels - The Judds5. Wild Angels - Martina McBride6. Angels Among Us - Alabama7. Ten Thousand Angels - Mindy McCready8. Ten Thousand Angels Cried - LeAnn Rimes
4,Best 2-player action for adventure gamers,"This is the best PS1 (PSX) game for 2 players who want to experience a world together (WITHOUT using split-screen). One player is Bugs Bunny, and the other is the Tazmanian Devil. Each has their own unique abilities to unlock secrets, solve puzzels, and beat opponents. Players must work together to explore each world (mostly based upon ancient civilizations, like the Aztec), looking for the various pieces of Granny's time machine. Large open-ended 3D worlds allow for wonderful gameplay. If one player gets lost off-screen, the other can summon them to their side with a click of a button. Also, the game does not end if only one player is eliminated (an Acme box containing the eliminated player is air-dropped and the adventure continues). All-around, one of the most enjoyable PS1 two-player games ever made."
4,good wax wood,"Good wax wood, needed a little sanding but good buy, as of wax wood goes this is good quality, just need to make it smooth for your hands to run thru, just take your time on sanding it"
3,Not The Top Of The Line,"I bought two of these based on a review that said they were inconsistent. The review was spot-on, and I bought them, even knowing I would have a lot of work to do. I have been able to straighten them somewhat by wetting and steaming, and have sanded one to get rid of the knot bumps, and, for the work, they are usable, if not ""performance grade.""I would take the chance again, since for the martial arts I practice (Tai Chi Chuan), spear forms are a high-level exercise. The spears have a heavier point, and these would otherwise be ideal, if they were something thicker. I suppose it counts on how many are in the ""batch"" received from China, and when one buys. I'm still hoping I can get them worked out."
3,"serviceable for rough work, not straight","I am not impressed with this product. It was received with a double bend in it that I will try to straighten. It may be important to some users/stylists to note that it is heavier at base (1.3""/34mm)tapering at the top(.9""/23mm@72""), and has flats and knots (one @3/16""). Perhaps after straightening it will make a rough usable 4' jo. A 48"" staff ordered at same time had a major bend to it, and a through knot 20"" from base and the same taper rate as the bo."
1,Baaaad Bo,"I got my staff about a week ago today. When I first saw the package, I thought to myself ""Aww man, they broke the staff in shipping"" because the package had a good 3"" bend in it. Turns out, it wasn't broken....it was just bent 3"". The bend was right at a knot in the wood, which I can only guess was a sapling at one point, because the ""stick"" for lack of a better word tapered severly from end to end (even though the description said it was the same thickness at both ends). Also, there were ""mini-knots"" from where the sapling (again...just guessing) had branches pruned off and not smoothed out. The whole staff was just a sad mess. The only good thing was that when I called the company to complain, they sent me a brand new staff for free...no questions asked, which was actually pretty cool. I haven't gotten the new staff, but it should be here soon. So, I'll either have 1 bad and 1 good staff, or 2 crappy sticks that I can use to hit people who are hiding around corners....more to come."
3,Not super high quality,The painting on the bowl was a little disappointing. It's not as fine as I had hoped beings I gave it as a gift. I guess that's what you get for ordering fine china off the internet.
3,Very informative,"This book is not in any macabe, it is in fact most informative with a lot of general history of the period a worth read for those with interest in the sort of people England, Scotland & Wales used as hangmen in early times."
5,Christmas in All Its Glory,"""A Waverly Consort Christmas"" is an outstanding mix of Christmas music ""from East Anglia to Appalachia."" Fans of early music will love th CD, , as well as those who enjoy Celtic and early American. There are familiar and traditional Christmas songs-- enough to keep it cozy. But I believe it is the new and perhaps unfamiliar selections that will draw and keep your attention. The Gregorian chant is absolutely heavenly and the early American pieces could make a persike dancing! My favorite selection is an early American piece called ""Exultation."" I never get tired of listening to this CD-- and in fact I play it all year long. I believe you will not be disappointed ."
1,not an exact match,"I tried to replace the thermostat on a 97' Jeep Grand Cherokee ORVIS V8, perhaps this model is slightly different from a regular V8, but I did all the work of taking the hose and housing out to later found out that it does not fit my vehicle, although the site gave me a check mark noting that it fits.I am so disappointed, not even worth to return it for the price, plus all my work was in vane."
4,very descriptive,I have served onboard naval transports and have always been interested in carriers. I found the book to be easy enough to follow. A basic familiarity with naval and aircraft terminology helps. A good description of shipboard life.
4,One of Tom Clancy's best books ever written.,"I really enjoyed reading this book. The U.S. Navy and the history of the development of its Aircraft Carriers is one of my favorite subjects. I have read a lot about Aircraft Carriers and of their importance in the military. I was also amazed at the large numbers of aircraft and personnel these ships can hold. The personnel includes the ship's officers and crew, Marine guards, pilots, mechanics and medical personnel. The book also includes an interview with the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Johnson and a fictional story at the end. These two items, the interview and the fictional story make this book even more better. This is one of my favorite books and I really enjoyed reading it. I don't think that it was a boring or depressing book at all. It was interesting and exciting. I think that this book is really worth reading. I also think that Tom Clancy should be congratulated for writing a book like this instead of being criticized for it."
4,Very good first hand account,"Reading this from the prospective of a 21 year Air Force vet, I found it to be very enlighting and informative. Overall a very good read."
3,repetative,The book becomes needlessly extended with repetition.Moreso the book became a sales tool for justification of billion dollar expenditures for the American Navy.
4,One of the best of the series,"This is one of the best of Clancy's Guided Tour series. Like all of them, the book is very informative, but this one doesn't get so bogged down in plane specs as to become unreadable as some have. Of course, technology has moved on in the last decade and the book hasn't, but the book can't be blamed for that. You just have to realize what it is, and accept it for what it is. The only drawback of the book is that while it is very detailed about the ships and especially the planes, little is said of the daily life of the sailors on a carrier. This may be because there are so many sailors with so many varied duties that an overall picture of one would not be representative of the whole, but I would have liked a bit more of picture of the human element. Still a good, informative book."
3,A dissapointment for Clancy,"Although this book contains a lot of great information on aircraft carriers, it lacks one thing. Spice. The info is great, and interesting. However, after a while, great info gets boring. Tom, I'm afraid this needed a little more work."
1,"This book may be nonfiction, but there is some nonsense","This book was a work of art in itself, and introduces the reader to almost every aspect of the aircraft carrier, the prized posession of the United States Navy. But however, the hypothetical situations are nonsense. Clancy picked India as his theater to explain the use of the carrier, and this was one mistake he will regret forever. India is no way an antagonist to the united states, and in no way wishes or wished to take over the island nation of sri lanka. Also, there is no possible way a single carrier group can defeat an entire nation's air force! Tom Clancy picked an awful theater to hypothetically explain the use of the carrier, and after reading my review, i hope he will not consider choosing such a theater again. This hypothetical nonsense turned a potential work of art into a proposterous bunk with a sour aftertaste."
4,a must for military buffs,"This is a most unusual book in that it goes into excruciating detail about the Navy, the Air Force and carriers. In fact, even though I found it fascinating reading, it's more than most people would want to know unless you're a real fanatic. At times I felt that a foreign power could learn how to duplicate our success by reading this book -- hopefully Clancy left some military secrets a secret!The most enjoyable parts of the book for me were the descriptions of the pilot training (and the amazing prowess of Navy flyers who have to catch a ""string"" upon landing so they don't fly right off the deck), life aboard a carrier and the interview with the navy official. The chapters devoted to the layout and structure of the carriers were less interesting from my point of view.A very detailed approach to carriers and their role in protecting our role in world affairs."
3,Might be a good present for a first communion,"Included in the gold-edged pages are classic Eloise Wilkin-illustrated stories (Prayers for Children, My Little Golden Book About God, Wonders of Nature) as well as a variety of other Golden book titles including Noah's Ark, The Friendly Book, The Lion's Paw and four more. Sturdy reinforced pages and a compact size (6x8) make it a good choice for six to eight year olds as a gift."
4,not individual books,I thought this was going to be individual books but is is one large bound book instead. ok I guess. not quality paper.
3,Not for the weak!,"This skull ring is a highly detailed piece, but I must worn, that the piece is highly raised from the hand and is heavy on the hand. One elbow sticks out quite a way from your hand, so watch out for injuring people when shaking hands! It does slide around the hand due to being off kilter because of the way it is sculpted. But again, for an avid skeleton lover, it is a must have."
2,Cheap quality,"Bought this watch and after using it for a week the security clasp became loose. Later the security clasp pin broke. The watch is beautiful and looks as if it were a very expensive watch, but the feel and the quality of the materials is cheap. Got a lot of compliments on the watch. By the way I bought three Invicta watches at the same time but to be honest will not buy another Invicta watch ever."
4,Naxos Repressing,"I wondered why this previously out of print and expensive CD was suddenly so inexpensive. It is a Naxos repressing of the original CD and, the copy I got from Amazon, is unmistakably a CD-R at that. The music is great and it's good to see it back in print but it should be noted here that it is not the original pressing. Also the extensive booklet mentioned in a previous review is not included with the Naxos release."
5,The Spice Cookbook,This book is favorite of my mother's and was given to me. I am now sending a copy to my daughter. The recipies are outstanding.
2,Not worth the price,Not written well. I had expected more detail. Incapable of holding my interest to explore the book further when I received it
5,Feels right,The training gun arrived quickly and is about as close to a 92F in weight and size as you're going to get.
4,Mr. Bean is such a funny actor,"To be honest I wasn't sure if I would like seeing him in the form of a cartoon, just cause I was so used to watching his other shows, but he's a really funny guy. I would recommend it, although it would have been nicer if they had included more episodes, cause I felt that it was a little short for the amount I paid."
2,Common sense wrapped in flowery language,"The author's flowery prose really came down to three things you need to do to achieve ""well being"".1. Eat right2. Exercise regularly3. Get enough sleepI was really hoping the author had some truly fresh ideas on achieving that inner peace we are all striving for in our too-fast paced lives. Unfortunately, all I got was something I learned from my parents and Sesame Street."
1,Poor Delivery,I ordered this item on December 16 and they could not get the item to me in time for Christmas. Pretty lame.
4,Great product to throw into your vehicle to carry your Apple product accessories!,We have loaded this up with our Apple cable and chargers to use in the cars. We even put in the Apple A/V cable accessory so we can plug in the iPads or iPods and play movies on the vehicle's LCD screen for the kids while we go on trips. This is a rugged case to hold everything with a strong zipper close. The iPod charger is OK but it will not charge an iPad or even an iPhone 4. The iSplitter is nice if you want to listen to the same music with someone else using headphones or earplugs.The case holds quite a bit and it will even carry CD's and a ton of cables for all of your accessories. We even take it into the hotel rooms and use the A/V cable we put into it to watch moves on the hotel TV.It is a good small to medium size (It is the size of a small portfolio) carryall bag and it really comes in handy when you are on the move.
4,An overlooked album,"A solid album that may have been sterotyped by its first single, Muskrat Love. The album was produced by America and rivals their later work with George Martin. It was their third album (hence the name ""Hat Trick"") and was actually a bit of a let down after their first two albums (America and Homecoming) had been huge hits. This album was a moderate hit in the US in 1973 peaking at 28 on the album charts. This album was their most ambitous effort to date. They run the gammit on this one, from harder rock (Green Monkey), to soft pop (She's Going To Let You Down), to folk rock (Windwave) and everything in between (Hat Trick). They make more use of strings than on their any of their previous work. If you are an America fan this album is a must.This import release is a little pricey. You should be able to find other releases of this CD cheaper."
1,don't buy,this is an Optima aquarium pump that you can buy on amazon for $26.99Aroma Thyme sells it for 89.99 Save your hard earn money and buy elsewhere
1,Do not buy,Essential oils leaked after 4 months of infrequent use; there is no way to repair; an expensive mistake.
3,NOT the best of,"I love documentaries, and Modern Marvels in particular. To my disappointment, this box set was just OK.First, as mentioned before, the first four or five discs are all about Engineering Disasters, and I even think one of the disasters runs on two of the dvds. Though they are alright, they aren't Modern Marvel episodes.Second, the episodes that are Modern Marvels aren't the BEST. I can think of two episodes I really wanted to see ... Salt Mines, and Oil Refineries ... aren't on here. 7 of the episodes are about Bridges, and not the bridges you really want to see. Over all, for $30, it is ok."
1,Does Not Fit My Car,This belt is about an inch longer than my old belt. The auto tensioner is not able to hold the belt tie. I check the length of my old belt. It is 1749mm instead of 1765mm. Never trust the Amazon look up no more.
1,Not What I Was Expecting,"First, I will start by saying that none of the music here was recorded by the original artists and the reproduction is sometimes really bad. Amityville Horror was particularly awful. The vocals in the original theme are replaced by synthisized voices from a keyboard. It sounded like it was recorded off of one of those cheap keyboards you get from a toy store. Second, the amature sound effects between songs run right over the begining of each song. I really wish I could have listened to this cd before I bought it. If I hadn't opened the package I would have returned this cd. If you are looking for horror movie themes, look elsewhere."
3,For a Halloween party,I found this CD a great value. I would recomend you buy it for your next Halloween party!!
4,If you like to move,"If you like to dance then this is the album for you, with this collaboration of hot beats and awsome mixes...you can't go wrong."
1,"Cheap, rusty, falls apart quickly","I ordered two dispensers. Within a week, one of them had rusted on the bottom so nasty red water spilled out every time the dispenser tipped. The spout fell off the other one within a couple months. The seller is now refusing to answer my emails. DO NOT BUY THIS POORLY MADE PRODUCT with poor customer service to match."
2,falling apart,This soap dispenser is not as sturdy as it seems. The pump keeps falling apart and there's a rusty discoloration at the bottom rim. I would not recommend this item.
1,badly packaged and received two broken dispensers,I do not know how long the pumps will last but the seller needs to hire someone who knows how to package items for shipment. The 3 dispensers I ordered were tossed in a box and then covered with foam peanuts. Two of the three dispensers arrived broken.I knew that these were cheap dispenser but as most of the time the pump quits working or the chrome plating becomes corroded I no longer invest in expensive ones expecting them to last longer. In theory these Interdesign soap dispensers were a good deal but with BIC Superstore doing the shipping this is not actually the case.For the time to order and deal with returns and getting a credit this is by no means a good value. Product may turn out to be OK but having to order 3 to get 1 that works due to seller negligence is not something I have encountered before with Amazon merchants. I definitely will not be buying anything from BIC Superstore in the future.
1,$60.00???????????,"Sweet jesus... $60.00!!!!!!!!!!1 this costs about $28.00 w/ shipping, bout $32.00. talk about a profit. hahahahahahahaha"
4,Where are the Halloween Songs?,"I have grade school children and found this CD to be a great source of Halloween fun. With all the focus on other holiday songs it was great to be able to share in the joy of song on this,one of the most silly-fun holidays."
2,Leaves alot to be desired,"This could have been a really good book if the author told the complete story. She left out so many meaningful parts. First the main character was a child (a very good start to the book), but then she was ""transformed"" to a teenager with a baby. (How/What happened?) Then, she quickly went from a teenager to a woman over 40. Could have been a great story if a story had been told."
4,Great Book. Attention grabber from the beginning.,"I have read Big Momma & Celeste and found it to be easy reading, and most enjoyable. My relatives are from Louisiana, and laughed at the part about the little boys because they said they can relate to that. My Uncle thinks the author must know him because he said she was right on target with her information."
5,Music,Cant find this cd anywhere.looked on all the music stores online.its the good old music from the rat pack.the price was just a little high for its age though.
1,BOYS NIGHT OUT,"Good misic, great sound, but to many unpopular ot unknown sons. This CD has been a big disapointment."
5,Great Book,The only book when it comes to Great Lakes Shipping. Fascinating detail and outstanding pictures. It is as fun to use as it is informative
3,not bright,This lite was a replacement for a Littllite that I bought several years ago. This one is not nearly a bright as the one it replaced.
5,superb buy,"This scope is excellent. Crystal sharp even at 60 magnification, and bright because of its 80mm objective lens. Tasco has managed to offer this with a full package of a tripod, a handsome hardcase, and, even softcase with a shoulder strap. All of this at a super price. Couldn't be more gratified.Also, the 45 degree angled eyepiece allows me to view the target without getting up from my sitting position. Keeping the scope on the tripod with the eyepiece facing me while I shoot, I just lean forward and view the target.Set-up Tip: In order to set-up the scope on the tripod to do this, screw the scope on perpendicular to the tripod handle. This way when you tip the handle upward, the eyepiece will be angled in the proper position toward your face."
3,Tasco Down Under,The product was exactly as described. Good optical quality but slightly limited at full zoom. Tripod was the main problem as it was relatively unstable.
2,false advertising,"I ordered this item from ADORAMA CAMERA particularly because it included a car window mount in all the information about it. But when it arrived, NO SUCH MOUNT. An email to ADORAMA to ask what happened - NO REPLY.The scope itself is good but I needed that car window mount!So what sort of advertising and service is this, ADORAMA CAMERA?I call it disgraceful, if not fraudulent!"
2,Should have been wonderful,"Janowitz is a wonderful singer with a glorious voice, but on this recodring she sounds very uncomfortable, and the loud and high parts come over as strident and the pianissimos are few and far between. This is a wonderful song-cycle as well, with a superb piano accompaniment, played wonderfully here by Gage. I don't quite know what went wrong, but I think her voice was in bad shape."
2,Not for flat top stoves,"I have had other Calphalon pans in the past and they were great. This one has been a big disappointment. The problem is I haven't been able to get one that is flat on the bottom. Three times I had the pan replaced, twice by the dealer and once by Calphalon and they all rock and spin on any glass surface. Actually the last pan was out of round as well. I think the quality control person fell asleep during this production."
4,great size and shape multipurpose pan,"I have used this pan many times for about 1 year (at least 2-3 times weekly); overall I have been quite happy with it. Its size and shape make it quite versatile; I use it to make all sorts of pasta sauces, braised chicken, and stir-fried meats and vegetables. The only problem that I have encountered is that after a year or so of use, the nonstick finish is no longer nonstick; likely because I have used it for stir-fried meats. There is a rough, dark coating which I cannot remove with the recommended cleaning; this debris flakes off while cooking and leaves a bit of black flecks on food. I was hoping this pan would last a bit longer but I need to replace it; I am looking for a regular finish pan of the same size and shape that I can scrub clean after stir-frying."
3,the quality is not worth of the money,"I've heard the great reputation of this Calphalon One nonstick 13-inch deep skillet with glass lid and bought this before christmas at $100. The skillet looks well built, and it is very balanced while I hold it in hand. I always use wood or bamboo utensil in cooking and use its soft side of sponge for washing. however, in less than one month, I've seen several permanent scratches in the skillet, which totally disappoints me. I would have not bought this skillet if I have known the non-stick surface is as fragile as other brands. So my opinion to this skillet: if you are looking for a durable non-stick skillet, don't buy this one for its appearance. Anyone who has good experience with durable nonstick skillet, please feel free to make recommendation. Thanks."
2,too heavy to manipulate,"Yes, the botton is not very flat, but it is OK. The nonstick function works well, but the skillet is very very heavy. Besides I think the design of the shape is not good."
5,looking for another copy,"i saw a copy of this book years ago, if you know where I can get a copy e-mail me at rajones8@yahoo.com. thanx"
3,Berio's Sinfonia; Boulez vs. Bernstein,"Listening to this recorded muddle of Berio's masterpiece sent me back to my old Columbia LP with the Swingle Singers and The New York Philharmonic under Leonard Bernstein. If Sony classical had the good sense to re issue the SUPERLATIVE Bernstein performance it would blow this poorly miked,unbalanced, unispired powder puff right out of the water. The recording engineers did Berio great disservice undermiking/mixing the orchestra here and adding hall ambiance to the New Swingle Singers voices. It sounds like it was recorded in a barn with a Jr High School PA System. Once you've ever heard the Bernstein you will find this performance offensive. Boulez, despite his reputation for avantgarde music, clearly misses the mark on this one."
3,good,Is a sweet story for animals but as a girl raised on a chicken farm I felt bad for how the boy was portrayed as evil for taking the chickens eggs.
5,Great Decoration,"I have this item and I find it a great decoration. You hammer 2 nails on to the wall and hang the scroll by the hooks it comes with. It is NOT out of paper. The picture has Yusuke, Kuwubara, Kurama, and Hiei with flames in the background. It's only for decoration, though, it is NOT a toy. So, if you're getting it for your child, make sure they know that all it is... is a decoration. Anyways, I give it 5 stars overall. Plus... when I put 4 stars as the durability, it's only because it's pretty thin and maybe you could hear some ripping noises if you stretch, but no, that didn't happen to me. I mean, my scroll is in mint condition, so as long as you don't try to stretch it or something like that, it'll be fine for sure. But overall, it's 5-star quality."
5,A reliable and precise performer for this amateur,"I have owned this router for @9 years and was so satisfied with it I purchased another, recently, for permanent installation in a table. In all honesty I should say I am an amateur occasional woodworker. With the older model it was easy find parts and repair when a switch failed."
2,"Very, very basic and not much help","Unfortunately, this is the first book I've actually returned to Amazon. The information is fine if you've never owned or managed a business before and have no idea what you're doing. But with all due respect to the author, this is kindergarten level material. I've already been in business for a number of years and found nothing helpful.If you're just getting started or re-entering the business world after a prolonged time off, go ahead and get the book. If you already have a business, you don't need this book--and probably could have written it yourself."
2,A bit shallow ok as stocking filler,"The book is simple and straightforward, but content would suit a pamphlet rather than a book. It does cover some basics - try an buy used as a filler book rather than pay full price."
2,neither very big nor very useful,"Pleasing to the eye but it surely fails to live up to the promise of its title. The instructions on constructing and throwing pots is adequate (though scanty).The sections on other aspects of the craft are more an outline than a guide. Disappointed, I searched our local community college library and found several comprehensive instructional texts on ceramics that were bigger and better than this book - though most were written 30 years ago."
4,Have had it in now for about a year; pretty good,"You can get a lot of spray out of this triple-headed shower. Just be aware of these things (which you can see from the photo): It needs a lot of room because it sticks out from the wall between 16"" to 28"" depending on how you position the handheld; the handheld sprays water at a different angle than the other heads; the handheld has a tendency to leak when you don't use it."
3,Captain's Shower Head,Does not perform as well as hoped. We have incredible water pressure and still the 3 settings on each showerhead give little in the way of a massaging stream whether you turn one or two off. Am going to try installing our old Waterpic shower head in the middle and see if I can get it to work with the side showerheads turned off. Does provide an encompassing waterfall to be under but would like to see this item tightened up to perform better with more settings included.
1,Bad Car Charger,I didn't try the I-Pod car charger until a year after I bought it and was very annoyed that it didn't worked.
5,Elementary Surveying 11 ed.,"These books came just as advertised, brand new. We were very happy with the purchase."
1,elementary surveying,"The book was fine, for being the previous edition.I had ordered the 12th edition and was delivered the 11th.The page numbers (minor) and the review questions (and their answers in the back) are different then the 12th where the rest of the class is working. According to the instructor, there are mistakes in the book that have been there un corrected since the 6th edition."
1,bad shipping,"One week after I ordered, the owner said the book is out of stock. This seller is not reliable."
2,Way too many errata for a recommendation,"I have been using this book for six months in two different courses, and have nearly completed it.While the content is fine, the number of errata in this book should not be tolerated.On the book's web page, numerous errata are listed, but there are many more that have not been reported or compiled. While trying to study this book, the errata keep getting in the way of understanding the material, as there are wrong equations, bad tables, etc.This book is in its tenth printing, and it is simply inexcusable that this many errata are allowed to remain in the book after so many printings.Another reviewer (an educator who has the edition with answers in the back) mentioned the number of incorrect answers in the educators edition as well.So, if you have a choice, look elsewhere for an elementary surveying text. The authors and/or publishers of this one obviously do not care enough to correct the numerous errors which confuse the student."
1,Horrible text book,"This is the worst text book I have ever used. There are many problems with it. Many of the problems are vauge and unclear in what they are asking. The explainations are confusing and unclear. There are even typos in the book. For each chapter, only about 5 answers are given to the homework problems. This makes it hard to know of you are doing the work correctly. This book is poorly written and extremly over priced. If you can avoid buying it please do. There has to be a better surveying text than this."
1,Not very helpful,"This textbook still has errors in it even though I have the 11th edition, I checked against a copy of the 12th. If they are just going to keep errors in there why put out a newer edition? A person could just stay with an older one. I guess its just a way for publishers to make some money at the expense of students. Also, these authors seem more interested in showing off their knowledge of surveying and calculations than trying to break it down. This is not an intro book but more of an intermediate level course book. The only way I was able to pass my class was that the instructor WAS able to break it down. This book is not friendly to beginners. You are much better off getting Survey Reference Manual by George Cole which is published by PPI."
5,IT WAS GOOD,it was so good i was uppset that it had to go with the birtday stuff.it was so good even tough the last song i could not lesen to.
5,baby doll car seat,"This doll accessory looks like the real thing. It fastens into the car like the real thing. My granddaughter buckles her baby in--and then buckles herself into her own seat. It is a great reinforcement of safety practice as well as fun for the ""little mommy""."
5,Great MOUS Test Prep Book,"I am MOUS (recently renamed MOS) Master Certified and obtained my certification by using only these books to prep. The CD that comes with the book is probably the best part. It features a hands on replication of the test. At the very least it prepares you for the types of questions and the testing environment, which helps greatly in getting over the fear factor. I have also taken the testing software the comes from Certiport, the developer of the MOUS certification tests, and found that this was better. As for the book, if your looking for indepth details, this is not the book for you. If you want a quick, to the point approach...I highly recommend it. After my certification I began teaching cMOUS certification courses and recommended these books and the PinPoint software as a great resource to my students. That is the depth of my reguard for this entire series of books."
3,"Gatco brass shower caddy - good quality, but...","The quality of this shower caddy is exactly what I have been looking for. It is much more robust then those you can buy in a bath store, and it will not rust because it is solid brass, and not brass-plated. However, there are a few issues: If you use the included wall mounting knob, the install instructions say to use a 3/16"" drill bit, but that size is actually too small for the included wall anchor. Also, since the caddy does not come with any way to anchor the bottom of it to the wall (such as suction cups), the caddy sways back and forth as you remove heavy items from it (such as a large, shampoo bottle)."
2,Corroded in little over a year,"Thought that a more expensive caddy described as ""enduring"" might last longer than the cheap looking chromed versions. It did last a bit longer than the cheap varieties and looks better but still corroded."
4,Mickey Finn throwing down some hard-hitting jump-up,"This is the 2nd CD of a two CD set. Disk one is Aphrodite who brings a happier jump-up set, but this disk is a lot darker and harder. I definitely recommend the first two tracks are amazing"
3,The Truth about Dogs,This book through marketplace was listed in excellent condition and also was listed as new. It was in fine shape but the description misrepresented the product and as a result I was a disppointed in my purchse.
1,Are we talking about the same book?,"This book suffers from a fatal flaw. It is boring. The is no new information here. For far better advice and information, see the Monks of New Skete books."
1,Nothing new & nothing good!,"I really didn't enjoy this book at all. Which is a surprise, since I adore to read about dogs. But this book didn't offer any new information (other than offering an explanation for why my dog peed around Mary D.- because she's so tall!); what was the most upsetting was that the author didn't actually seem to like dogs very much. Also, the book really discounted the connection between a dog and its owner. And, I must admit, the gene-therapy at the end, I could only skim... it was a little too boring. Oh - and this book made a one paragraph dismissal of Rupert Sheldrake's entire book,Dogs That Know When Their Owners Are Coming Home: Fully Updated and Revised, which hardly seems like a thorough rebuttal... This really just wasn't enjoyable, as it was filled with redundant information and an underlying tone of distaste for dogs.To be perfectly honest, I am actually considering getting rid of this book altogether because I despised it so."
4,The Best Book on Canine Behavioral Ecology Yet...,"Having at one time fancied myslef an Evolutionary Biologist (until I had to make an actual, lucrative living) I thoroughly enjoyed this dispassionate treatise on canine behavior. I am a lifelong dog owner love them to pieces. This book does a great job of deconstructing the myths of dog behavior and rightly provides criticism of the eugenics of modern dog breeders. A little bit more in this regard would have been desirable to me, but I'm still thrilled that someone is bringing up many of these issues.This book will piss a lot of people off."
5,This video has survived three children...,"I bought this video for my oldest son. He and his sister watched it and loved it. Now, my two year old is enjoying it. It's cute. The puppets are adorable and the songs are silly and sweet. This was all three of my kids favorite video when they were toddlers."
4,Cute,"My kids really like the part with Kermit and the other frogs. I thought they would watch the whole video more than they have, but they might still be a bit young to understand it all (2 and 4 years old)."
4,HARD TO FIND SING ALONG,GOT IN THE TIME STATED AND WAS IN AS GOOD OF SHAPE AS I WAS TOLD IT WOULD BE.
5,AWSOME. half off then elsewhere.,"almost everyone else has this DIRECT FIT sensor for over $150.. with that beign said, its a great buy. brand new in original box. prompt shipping, will be installing this weekend. Make sure you buy/rent the special tool to put it on, or else you will destry the old one, and damage the new one."
2,pig puffs,I was not fully happy with my purchase. I usually buy this product at Fleet Farm for my dog. They are 40 oz bags for 7.95...i was under the assumption that these pig puffs were the same size and the original price was the same as the ones at Fleet Farm. This product was 4 oz and i bought 2 bags. So basically i spent the same amount of money for 2 bags as the one i would of got a Fleet Farm and only got a quarter the amount. I will never purchase this product again.
2,A book for the non-user,"(...)This is another example of merchandising over content. Not that the book is error ridden. It is not. It is competent for those first coming to knowledge of penile mechanics. To entitle it ""Dick"" is to shade the book with a degree of salaciousness and probably motivates the unwary and coffee table-display set to buy it for titillation, only to hand it over to Tiffany and Jared to satisfy pubescent curiosity, when the true nature of the content is discovered.Guys, enter 'human penis' in Google search and you'll find more pertinent information in five minutes."
1,Women telling men how to enjoy men?????,Boo. The last person with whom I wish to speak about sex is a woman. Even straight men talk with other men. How many lesbians would tolerate a book written for them by a man about women? You KNOW that wouldn't go over. She should talk about her own genetalia & periods and stuff lesbians are interested in and actually know about. Even Straight women prefer a female gynecologist
5,Basically Informative,"I got this thinking the ""doctor"" association of the author would lend more authority & substance to the book than it did (at least for me). Don't get that comment wrong though, the book is very sound & covers all the basics any memeber of either sex should know. But; alas, that is about all it does besides throw in some very good humor. I think I was looking for something more contemporary, that included more on male sexual response & psycology as well as the variability of female views of male sexuality; the book is very thin in this area. All in all it has to be said; however, that this work should be read by anyone and every one that may have anything to do with its main topic (which should include about 99.999% of us)."
5,Best Firefighting Learning Book Around,"This book is the best firefighting book I have seen around. It covers everything from the history of the fire service, the orginaztion all the way to how to prepare for a terrorism event. I really enjoy this book!"
2,Not at the top of my reading list!,"A lot of grammar errors. Some diagrams & paragraphs that contradict each other. A lot of contradicting what IFSTA books say....nuff said, hope you get the point!"
5,Excellent,"I found this book very useful. This is an excellent introduction in fire fighting and rescue. In my country (The Czech Republic) some drills, standard operation procedures and organization matters are different, but this publication is still very useful and inspiriting."
5,Great book!,"This book has to be, hands down best book to get if you want to know all about Firefighter I."
2,It was OK,"When I ordered this cookbook I was not expecting what I recieved. I wanted a book that had meals that used mostly what I had on hand. I wanted guidance on how to cook in a crock pot basic meals. I have made a few recipes in this book and they were ok, nothing outstanding. Most of the recipes I would not make. Hope this is helpful."
4,Very good cookbok for Whole Foods,"I am someone who prefers to cook with whole foods and all natural ingredients. I never want to use pre-mixed items like cream-of-anything soup, salad dressing or taco mixes, so I was happy that all the recipes in this book rely on fresh ingredients. I have a well stocked kitchen (with many spices) so I admit, that has helped with some of the more elaborate dishes. Overall, all the recipes I have tried so far have been flavorful, though in some cases I choose to add additional salt, pepper or other spices, but that is a matter of preference. I think this is a great book with a wide variety of dishes. It is worth a try if you hate store bought mixes and ""recipes"" that rely on pre-mixed condiments for flavor."
2,Picky eater,"I'm sure this book may be helpful for some people, but I was looking for more simple recipes for a very picky eater. Things that had more pasta, ground meat, etc. There are things in some of these recipes that I don't even know what they are or where to get them,and I'm sure my son wouldn't eat. Also some of the prep time was quite long, I want things I can put in there and forget it. If I spend 45 minutes preparing a meal, I shouldn't have to wait 2 or more hours on the slow cooker to finish it."
5,Spectacular!,"At long last, a ""man's"" subject written in a ""woman's"" language. Just great. I'm recommending it to all my friends!"
5,Cover to cover,"The book is well written with very good, helpful information appropriately humorous at times, serious at others. Fantastic. It is the first How To book I've ever read cover to cover. I learned a lot, and laughed out loud."
2,I Still Haven't Found What I'm Lookin' For,"I was looking for a book that tells you how to prevent bad things from happening- a recommended schedule of maintenance for my home. This book tells you how to handle problems after they have happened. I get the impression that they want you to buy the book, figure out that you have no idea how to fix your problem, then look to see if there's a ""Rent-a-Husband"" franchise in your city."
3,Gritty Garage Rock,"A great collection of gritty garage tunes. All tunes sound like they were cleaned up from vinyl records. Not bad, but not terrific either. Probably the only place you will find these obscure songs. Wish the master tapes could have been found with Little Walter & Bill Inglot doing the remastering, but alas, 'tis not to be. Evidently the songs were pressed by extremely small record labels and very little detective work or money must have been spent looking for the masters to these tracks. The liner notes give a nice bio of the bands with pix of the original 45's sprinkled throughout. Rather than a booklet though, the notes are in a fold out poster form. All tracks on this disc are mono, NO STEREO HERE!!! Still, this is GREAT GARAGE ROCK and meant to be played CRANKED UP!"
5,A master class with the master,"My whole adult (and even teen) life I've wanted to become a filmmaker for two reasons. 1) to meet and talk to Billy Wilder and 2) to make films. Well, after soaking up Crowe's real, in-depth, and very personal hours with Mr. Wilder, I truly feel like the first of those reasons has been pretty much done away with. This book is, hanging out with the master. As for the second reason, well, I'm still working on it."
5,A Great Read,"I've become incredibly obsessed with Cameron Crowe's Jerry Maguire and his new Untitled film and I admit to buying this book because I was more looking for insight about Cameron Crowe, not Billy Wilder. However, I must say that I was curious as to why Crowe chose a director I hadn't been exposed to yet (I'm a young filmmaker without much depth). I got what I wanted -- learned a great deal about Crowe and learned without seeing any of Wilder's films why he is who he is. I've now run out and watched many of Billy Wilder's films, largely because of my curiousity stemming from reading the wonderful interviews. Wilder is what I personally hoped some famous directors would be like -- quick witted, hillarious, and sweet."
2,"Great for Wilder fans, but should have been better.","I'm a huge Billy Wilder fan, so I couldn't wait to get my hands on this book. It's a delight to hear the director in his own words, but Crowe's fawning questions rarely get to the heart of either the man or his work. The biography that came out last year, ""On Sunset Boulevard,"" did a better job of revealing the true Wilder, warts and all, while presenting a more coherent overview of his life's work than a Q&A format would allow. This is a nice companion piece, but it's still a runner-up in the Wilder book derby."
2,Rather disappointing,"I admire both Crowe and Wilder as filmmakers, but I was not impressed with what I read of this book. Crowe seems to me a lightweight interviewer -- he adopts the same sycophantic tone used by Truffaut in his famous interviews with Hitchcock. Perhaps one could have done no better; Wilder is, after all, in his 90s, and is probably not inclined to give answers in much detail. He is easily distracted, and Crowe is kept busy just keeping the conversation on topic. The book is fun to read, but I don't think it gives much insight into Wilder's art."
5,A must read for anyone interested in a genius film maker,"Cameron Crowe's insightful interviews reveal the good, the bad, the ugly and the brilliance of one of Hollywood's greatest talents."
2,poorly made,I purchased this as a Christmas gift for me son in what I thought was plenty of time before Christmas. The first one arrived and as I took it out of the box to inspect it several of the cup/chip holders fell out. So I glued those back in thinking if that's all that is wrong no big deal. Then I looked at the inlay and it would not unfold flat and the felt was all bunched up in some spots. Again I thought for the price I could live with that but when I folded it back up to put away the backing of the board was all cracked and split. I emailed the seller and they agreed to send a new one. They picked up the old one and a week later I finally received the new one. Two days before Christmas. The second one had the same issues as the first but was too late to send back. I really like the design of this table and decided you get what you pay for. I purchased this for $35. This is not of high quality but good enough for beginners.
3,"Great For Poker, But Insert Was Not As Described","I'll keep this short.I ordered this on April 3rd and received it April 5th. I opened it up and everything seemed to be great. The felt felt great (see what I did there?) and the only thing I would have wanted was for the felt around the foldable sections to be tighter. The cup holders aren't exactly designed to stop a spill but are more or less indented coasters.My issue is with the insert. The product is designed to have a craps/blackjack insert, and mine somehow had craps/roulette. Some of you might not care, but my friends and I only play poker or blackjack. Luckily Amazon is great with returns so I might order another and hope it has the right insert."
2,"Poor quality table top, barely worth $60.","The quality of this table top is very poor. The felt has bumps and wrinkles all over, when you unfold the table top it will not be even and i noticed lots of glue residue all over. The felt for the black jack piece suffers from even worse quality. The plastic pieces for cup/chips are falling off after used it for 2 times. If you don't have a bottom table at least the size of the table top, You have to tell your guest to not to put their elbows on it, because that will crack the board. The size of the table top is very small for 8 people, but good enough for 6. It does serve the purpose functionality wise. For that i give it a 2 stars. If you are inviting more than 6 people over and try to impress them, keep looking. But if you want to save a couple hundred dollars,entertaining a crowd no more than 6 people, only use it a few times a year and have a table bigger than the table top than go ahead get this one."
1,ship it already!,"I wish when I placed an order...It would be shipped, or atleast the process would start maybe... oh i don't know, THAT WEEK MAYBE!!!PLEASE SHIP ALREADY!!!!!!!!I placed an orrder and am still waiting for it to be shipped.... I don't wanna sound rude but how hard could it be?"
3,Pretty good for the price,"The table is smaller than it looks in the picture, I thought it would cover our dining room table (which is pretty small) and it actually left about 3 inches of table sticking out from under it. The felt wasn't smoothed out properly in several places, leaving bumps when a poker table really needs to be perfectly smooth. Some of the graphics were a little faded as well and over all I was a little disappointed with the quality. With that being said, it is really nice looking set up and my boyfriend loved it. For a guy's night of poker it will work just fine."
1,Returning it!,"It had extra felt where it folds up that gathers on top of the table and looks terrible plus prevents putting the felt pieces (""inserts"") on top for blackjack and craps. Not worth the money"
3,"Nice, but smaller than expected.","This table top set feels and looks very nice, and the carrying case is handy. That said, it's much smaller than I was expecting and I don't think we'll be able to use it for an 8-player game. Even with the leaf out on our dining room table, it doesn't cover the entire top (and our table is not that big). I probably should have gotten out a measuring tape before ordering it. We're planning to hang onto it and think it'll have other uses, but it won't be quite right for our bi-monthly games."
3,Too gaudy,"When I saw this, I thought it would be great for my husband because it's 3 in one. But the decoration is way too much and gives it kind of a feminine look. I wish I had purchased a plain one. The chip holders are a nice touch."
3,Craps table portion had spelling errors,Table is good buy but craps side has improper odds written on it and spelling mistakes. Overall for the price it is a quality product.
3,OK for the price,For the price it's ok. I wouldn't recomend buying a 4 fold top for anyone that plays much. All the folds are good but 1 just got to pay a little attention when dealing to that side of the table
4,hours of fun with friends,"you'll get a perfect table to play texas hold'em with your friends, if you are not a Pro and want to add a lil' bit of style to your night games do not think twice, buy this one and create a different athmosphere at your home, turn your home table into a texas hold'em table"
5,Great item!,"This is an excellent product. Bought it as a Christmas present for my brother in law, but it's so nice I'm ordering another for ourselves! Perfect for poker night."
4,Pretty good 3 in 1 game for the price.,"Pros:-I like that it folds up and comes with a carry bag.-It's fun to use for parties because you can switch up the games.-The cup and chips holders are very convenient.-It is made of pretty good materials.Cons:-Because it's able to fold, the large piece doesn't lay completely flat because the fabric doesn't stretch. I did get it to flatten, but the fabric on one edge started to unglue from the foam core. Not a huge deal, but not perfect.-The reversible blackjack/craps topper has excess material sticking up in the folds, so it doesn't look flat and gets in the way of rolling dice. This happens because you need extra material in order for it to fold up. It's not terrible, but could be nicer.Overall I am satisfied with it for the price."
5,Very Satisfied,Other than the freight cost to get it to my destination being a bit high due to the weight I was very pleased with the product and would recommend without hesitation.
1,This is a number set,"Per the part number of 22901, this is a number set, NOT the letter set shown in photo!!! Totally mis-leading advertising on the vendor's part. Don't get fooled - buy somewhere else.Ken H>"
5,Dodge caravan manual,My husband purchased this manual guess this was ok as he used it ans didnt have any problems or complaints about it.
5,"What a great, great, GREAT book","I bet I have read and re-read this book at least a hundred times. Ms. Radziwill just does an outstanding job of describing her very interesting life-story What an exceptional young woman. She writes from the heart, has a darling wit; writes as though this is her 50th book! So accomplished. Once you begin it you will not put it down. I truly cannot remember the last time I enjoyed a book as much as I enjoy this one. (It probably does not hurt that I am a big Kennedy family fan); but truly, even without the Kennedy insight this story is fascinating. What an interesting family the DeFalco's are! A must read, truly. Thank you Ms. Radziwill and I cannot wait for your next book!"
4,What Remains,"I thought the book well written. Good description of people and places, I felt like I could visualize all even though I haven't spent much time on the east coast. I enjoyed the beginning of the book where Carole describes her family and summer vacations, it was colorful.This book also gives some insight to how the Kennedy family and relatives are taught to function in life. They take care of their own. I would recommend this book."
5,OUTSTANDING MEMOIR,"EXCELLENT. MOVING. EXACTLY HOW A MEMOIR SHOULD BE. AND FINALLY, A TRUE, KINDLY PORTRAIT OF CAROLYN, JOHN'S WIFE. I COULDN'T PUT THIS BOOK DOWN AND ALL I READ ARE TRUE STORIES. THE BEST."
4,Liked Carol after reading the book and like her more now...,For standing up for Mary Richard Kennedy. Realized I had never reviewed the book which is somewhat timeless - still would be a good read now. Enjoyed it alot and wood have given it 5 stars if not for times where there was a little too much detail about her husband's illness.
4,Helpful if you are also going through a loss,"Carole tells the story of her relationship with her terminally ill husband. It is helpful, as a woman of nearly the same age, to hear her very personal telling of the story. I lost my mom recently and it was good to know that there are moments of joy and happiness and particularly how Carole found those moments, among the final sadness and despair. I hope Carole writes more and I wish her much success. She revealed herself in this story and I appreciate her sharing. This book helped me to personally also find more joy in the long and sad journey of the passing of my sweet mom, in a round about way."
5,Great Book!,"I loved this book! It made me laugh and made me cry!! The beginning is a little slow, but I soon found myself engrossed in Carole's life of a small town girl to family with the Kennedy's. The love between Carole and Anthony was inspiring and heartbreaking. A must read!!"
5,Wonderful.,It takes a very brave human to share ones journey......if we could all share our pain so honestly and eloquently.What a wonderful world it would be.
4,very good,I love the way she writes. Gave it a shot on a whim and read the whole book in a couple days.
4,Worth a read,Thought this book was pretty good. I found myself putting it down for days at a time though which is not normal for me. I liked that she was very honest about her feelings throughout her husband's illness and did not sugar coat things. Her relationship with Carolyn seemed honest and sweet. Definitely worth a read!
5,Inspirational,"I thoroughly enjoyed What Remains. Carole Radziwill shares her extremely personal journey through the most horrendous time of a person's life with grace and sophistication. She is honest that she didn't always make the best decisions, but they were her decisions to make. I love Carole on #RHONYC and now I have an even better understanding as to why I am drawn to her on the show; she is someone that I aspire to be more like. She is funny, witty, and genuine in this memoir."
5,captivating and beautifully written,"I just finished the book last night, crying as I read the last few pages. I guess since Carole Radziwill and I are the same age and share a lot of the same interests helped capture me into this memoir and unable to put it down. It also gives you some unheard stories of the famous family. I felt like I knew Carolyn Bessette Kennedy better through this story rather than the tabloid press. She was a delightful and woman, filled with life, which makes her ending even more tragic. The book honors a beautiful friendship and a marriage tested by CANCER. It pays homage to Anthony Radizwill as well as John and Carolyn Kennendy as it lets you see them as real people rather than tabloid fodder"
5,Wonderful story...,"I loved this book, it is a fantastic read. I was so moved by Carole's story and the way she told it. I couldn't put the book down, finished it in one day!"
4,Riveting & Heartbreaking,"I could not put this book down, but thought she over did explaining her childhood. Other than that I found this to be one of the most heartbreaking books I've ever read. Her abilityto describe the smallest detail made me feel as though I waswatching a movie instead of reading a book."
3,Weak ...,"I thought I could relate because aim a widow myself, is just cute, will not spend money n it , would have read it if was for free..."
4,Entertaining Read...,"I enjoyed reading this book a great deal. I truly appreciated Carole's Cinderella story with a twist. I was hoping for more family details, but I guess some things deserve to remain private. A great book, heartbreaking to realize it is Carole's true story. I love where she finally decides to end the story. I would definately recommend this book."
2,DEPRESSING!!!!!!!,"What a sad, depressing book. I couldn't finish it. It was such a downer. The author is obviously very intellingent and writes well, but the book brought me way down. I didn't like the way it made me feel. It was hard to think of anything but death after I put it down."
1,Not much remains,"Very predictable. Author too self-congratulatory about her professional strivings, her rags-to-riches arrivism, and her own endurance as next-of-kin during a cancer struggle. We learn much of her infatuation with JFK Jr. & Carolyn Bessette and almost nothing of the personality of the dying young husband or the marriage beyond vacations and access to privilege. For a widow memoire, look to Joan Dideon."
5,"page turner, heartwarming, great read","I have read quite a few memoirs lately (The Tender Bar, The year of Magical Thinking, Million Little Pieces-part memoir)and by far this was the best one I read. I love Carole Radziwell's writing style and I found her story to be gutsy, emotional and truthful. As a person who watched a loved one die of cancer before my eyes I could totally relate to her feelings of frustration, helplessness and sadness. I can say their is nothing on earth worse than watching a love on deteriorate before your eyes and not able to save them. I had no idea of the relationship between her and the Kennedy family so i was very intrigued by her personal view of the family and the friendship. I felt she wrote this book with great respect for her husbands family revealing what she deemed approriate written with integrity. This was a magnificent first book and I look forward to reading more of her work. I highly recommend this book."
2,Deceptive and Shallow,"Charlie Rose interviewed Carole and I remember thinking, ""My, he's so dismissive of her."" I can see why now. She never makes any of these people come to life.That's the tragedy of the whole thing...you never get to know any of these folks. I mean Carolyn forgets her toothbrush when she stays in the house that all of them share. So? I mean that is about as deep as she is going to get into this woman.At the end of Charlie Rose's interview with Carole Radziwill he left her feeling so miffed that SHE had to tell HIM that people thought she told her story well. He just shrugged. He was right."
2,Dind't care for it.,"I didn't really care for it, from reading the front flap I thought this book would be much more intresting than it really was. I was never able to really get into the book, and was seen forcing myself to finish it. The only reason I made myself finish the book was to read the ending, about John and Carolyn's accident and the way Anthony passes away."
5,You've got a friend!,"One of the best books I've read so far...how I envy the writer for being able to write and put her life and experiences to her writings to some that I can partly relate too. her growing up years with her aunts was an awesome and funny read, her mentioning balsam flex shampoo brought in memories of myself that I completely forgot about from time passed, her detailed explanation regarding the condition of her beloved Anthony was heartbreaking. Her head leaning int his chest till his last breath made me shudder with sadness but would might do the same if stricken with the same ordeal rather than pacing around..I could go on.....not to forget, she's so down to earth a person, she must have a good pure heart..I have become a fan of hers!!!!"
4,"slow at first, but a great read","i enjoyed reading carole's book. i also am a young widow who's husband died of cancer, so i was able to relate to the pain carole experienced during her husband's treatment and his passing. thank you carole for sharing your story, i'm sorry you lost 3 special people in a short time frame."
5,A Real Writer,"Carole Radziwill brings Anthony, John and Carolyn back to life in her amazing, thoughtful and detailed memoir. The author, an initial outsider to the Kennedy clan, is really allied with the reader here, bringing her observant perspective into play as she tells the tale. It is a sad tale, but it is compelling. I gulped down this book in two days and look forward to reading more by this author. (It would be interesting to read her intelligent take on the Housewives, no?)"
5,"Compelling, gracefully written book ...","who knew what to expect, but wow what a story and this girl knows how to tell it ... this book is beautifully, beautifully written. she writes with such eloquence and has an interesting story to tell ... she goes from one headstrong, large and complex family into another. it's interesting, really, how similar they are .. her own family with very little money, no furniture or any of the normal trappings of their suburban neighborhood, to the radziwills ... princes and princesses ... there's a line in carole's acknowledgements that ""all families are pretty much the same"" and she shows it here, drawing the one she was born in and the one she married into, so vividly ... one of many themes she weaves subtly through this rich book. I finished it, then picked it up again and again ... rereading favorite passages ... just couldn't put it away."
4,I couldn't put it down,"Just a fabulous book - Carole Radziwill wrote a beautiful love story - about her marriage to Anthony Radziwill and her friendship with Carolyn Bessette. This book made me feel joy when she was feeling joy and sadness as she dealt with the tragedies of losing her husband and best friends. I needed a box of kleenex for this one.I would've loved to have read more about interactions with her own family during her marriage with Anthony, but she gives an excellent glimpse of what it was like to connect with families that were always in the public eye. Loved the section ""Discoveries"", Chapter 5."
3,More Than Enough,"The author's story is centered on her loss of her husband and his counsin and his wife, John and Carolyn Kennedy. She seems to be careful not to reveal too much of the Kennedy's lives and yet tell her story that includes them. The first part of the book that tells about her family and childhood is much too long and repetitive. If the purpose of this section is to show to extreme difference in her background and her husband's, the length is totally unnecessary because that is evident very soon.She does a good job of expressing her strength and pain and the stoic reactions of her husband.A good read but don't expect a tell-all about the Kennedys."
5,A beautiful book,"I loved this book. It is beautifully written. It is a very interesting story of their meeting, falling in love, and the struggle to keep her husband alive during his long and valiant fight with cancer. It moved me to tears and the book stayed with me long after I was finished reading it. I would highly recommend this book. Carole Radziwill has written a lovely tribute to her husband and the Kennedy's and shown herself to be an incredibly strong and loving woman."
4,A widows memories revealed,"A poignant, personal look at the loss of two men, too soon. We get some very insightful looks at the real JFK, Jr and his cousin Anthony Radziwill. Two cousins who were close as brothers, and lost their lives within three weeks of each other. The world thinks they know everything about the Kennedy's but there are some interestings facts that we learn from Carole Radziwill. Her strenghth in dealing with her husbands illness is admirable. The fateful night that took John, Caroline, and Lauren's lives is revealed in heartwrenching detail. A very interesting read."
4,Good good good,Message for all who doubt they can attain their secret dreams: read this tale before you give up. The author has a right to tell this story because it is HER story and we all are connected to others. If other people in our lives couldn't be mentioned in our stories there would be no biographies. The author does a good job portraying what needs to be portrayed in order to bring the reader in close enough without betraying confidences. Every one will come away with their own insights to life's wonders.
