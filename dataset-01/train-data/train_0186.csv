1,Hateful and Dangerous,"Beneath its debatably adorable exterior lies a terribly designed and relentlessly frustrating product. The separated chambers do not lock together in any helpful way, causing water to leak out of every possible crack at the slightest touch or movement. Which is always a safe and fun feature for children's electrical equipment. It's hard for me to fully articulate how much we loathe this horrible piece of junk, and the only thing stopping me from drop-kicking it is the fact that it would explode mid-air and I'd have to sheepishly pick up all the shattered pieces off the front yard. Still, I'm planning a suitable destruction of it in the near future, something hilarious and permanent, that involves me looking directly in the penguin's dead eyes."
1,Waste of money!,Purchased this humidifier to take with us on our trip for our daughter. The fan did not work. I had to go out to the store and purchase another brand.
5,Great Humidifier,This our 3rd humidifier for our daughters room. It is by far the best one yet. It has an easy fill tank that lasts at least 2 nights. It does not require a filter so it seems easier to keep clean. We have been using for about 2 months and have not noticed any of the white film that occurs with some of the humidifiers. I would highly recommend this for a child's room.
1,Broke Down after 4 weeks,"Followed directions to the letter..was trying to clean with vingear this afternoon, and sitting it in the wash basin, it broke--agh plastic stuff--this product is not sturdy enough to last. Cute, but useless...it lasted only 4 weeks..Diane Werneke"
5,Lasts through the night...,Works very well for my nursery. It lasts a long time without having to refill frequently. My husband usually turns it on when we go to bed at 10pm and lasts until 4pm the next day as long as water has not dried out. Just make sure it is cleaned after each use.
1,"Swayed by other reviews, but didn't live up to expectations","After reading the reviews, and thoroughly vetting the humidifier (I thought) I ordered two of the penguin humidifiers. The first was for my daughter's room, the second would eventually be for our bedroom. I ran the humidifier per the instructions the first evening, ensuring the stream of mist wasn't saturating the floor. The result, the humidity in my daughter's room never got about 20%. She awoke the next day coughing and with a dry nose. The next evening I tried it on full throttle, despite the instructions. After running the whole night the room made it up to 25% humidity (with my former humidifier it got up to 40%). In my last attempt I simply removed the penguin's head, to see if that would result in better room saturation. Unfortunately, it led only to a very wet dresser and humidifier.Besides all of these negative tests, I had to refill the penguin half-way into the evening, since the reservoir had run out.1/2 star"
1,"Cute, would be nice if it had turned on","Adorable, yes. Functional, no.Darned thing came defective and wouldn't power on. Just didn't have the time to deal with returning it and missed my window. $30 out the window :("
1,not working now,it didnt automatically shut off when the tank was empty!!!!!now it doesnt work and my boyfriend is helping me fix it...
3,"Glug, Glug, Glug","That's the sound this thing makes every six minutes or so. (It kept me from falling asleep, so I started running it for five hours before I went to bed instead. Guess what? It still makes the noise even when turned off!... although not as frequently.) If you can get past this, the unit works fairly well, and you'll find your throat is a lot less dry throughout the night. After five months my unit started leaking, but after a cleaning and rinsing out it seems to have stopped. If you run it for about eight hours a night, you may find that refilling it every few days is a pain. All in all, it's a good ""test"" humidifier to help decide if you want to spend big bucks for a real one."
4,very very good product,very good product. makes A LOT of steam. absolutely silent. contains a lot of water that lasts a long time.
4,Not just for babies,"I don't have a place where you can hide a humidifier and they all stick out like a sore thumb. So, as I purchase many items, I went for cute. I am actually very happy with this product. It is quiet, cute, and most importantly functions as a humidifier."
3,Alright,I am using this for last 3 weeks. Overall a good product. Quite sturdy except for the feet portion that got cracked in the first week. So be careful while handling. Frogy head has 2 openings over the eyebrows for vent. But as you increase the speed the hood gets loose and mist comes from the side of the head as well. No complains for functionality.
4,Super Cute,"Works well and is super cute in our little boy's room. We weren't sure where to put it. The closest plug in was behind dresser that doubles as the changing table. The kid kicked it off one day during a change and broke the bottom inside piece and now it leaks so we can't use it. Up until that unfortunate incident, it worked well and he loved trying to catch the mist if he was under it while it was turned on."
4,works well,does the job I got it to do. I am glad I bought it helps put the moisture back in the air.
3,Bad design,This is a good humidifier. It works well and the quality of the plastic is excellent. It's easy to clean and disinfect. The primary issue is that the vapor comes out the top of the owl's head and spills down directly on whatever the humidifier is set on top of. This soaked the night stand that I had the owl on. What I ended up doing was drilling out the eyes of the owl and covering the original vents with electrical tape. Now it's a perfect product. I'd never seen a humidifier that sent vapor straight up. Very poorly thought out.
2,Did not work,"Okay so I originally ordered two of these crane humidifiers, one Hello Kitty and the other Sponge Bob. The Sponge Bob one worked no problems, great. The problem is the Hello Kitty one only worked for about two hours and then stopped working. I tried to troubleshoot and all I could think of was empty it out, dry it and start all over, which I did and got the same results. I called the manufacturer and they told me it sounds like a faulty unit so they sent me the warranty information, which stated to return part of the item and if I wanted a replacement I needed to send in a check for $25 for shipping and handling, which I do not think is fair because it's not my fault the unit does not work. I already paid for the unit which did not work properly from the get go and now I have to spend more money on it. I did not think that was fair."
2,already stopped working,"These have to be cleaned often and when you do the whole house reeks of vinegar. ugh. THey are cute and quiet, though. My daughter still loves it so I guess I will go clean it out again....."
1,"Adorable, yes. Works, no","This was a great little humidifier. It was cute & the elephant went well with the jungle theme of our nursery. I followed the manufacturer's care instructions & was diligent about cleaning the tank & base. Unfortunately, after about 3 months of night-time only use, the fan started making a really load noise and we could no longer use the machine. I really expected to get more use out of this humidifier. We decided to forgo cute & buy a real humidifier the second time around. We sure hope it lasts longer this time."
1,Doesn't change the humidity level,"We purchased the pig, which is adorable but it does not change the humidity level in our 200-250 square feet bedroom. The hygrometer I purchased gives the humidity perecentage when the level reaches 20%, otherwise it reads ""Lo."" After trying it for 3 nights, putting it on as soon as we got home and shutting it off before leaving for work, the humidity level in our room did not get above the ""Lo"" reading. So even if it went from 15% to 19% that's not a good level. It should be anywhere from 40-50% using a humidifier. Yet a steamy shower in the bathroom next door will raise the humidity level in our bedroom to 21-23%. So the hygrometer does work."
1,"Too fragile, cheap construction",What a cheap piece of junk. The plastic construction is so flimsy that it arrived with one cracked foot from Amazon. The penguin head fell off within a week while adding more water and broke into 3 pieces.
1,paying attention to reviews,"I put a lot of research into purchasing a humidfier through consumer reports. What I discovered is there is not a ultrasonic humidifier on the market that has over 50% of very good actual consumer reviews. This crane product had the best overall reviews I could find. After just a few days in began dripping water out of the bottom of the unit, which was one of the common problems in the reviews. My advice to anyone looking for a humidifier: If you have a forced air heating system invest in a april air unit attached to the furnace. Trouble is I now have a boiler system."
3,"Quiet, Cute, Fast.. Small range","Like most other reviews this is not a bad little humidifier. My only complaint is that it spews mist maybe a foot or two. The one I had as a kid flung mist like six feet or something into the air. I have this Crane sitting on top of the box it came in on my nightstand, then the mist falls onto my face."
1,really bummed out,"i was so excited when i got this little guy, showed him off to all my friends and enjoyed good rest for a week. Then...it just stopped pumping the mist out, it went from billows to trickle feed. so I cleaned it really well plugged it back in and still nothing. At first i thought it was just me, but then after a quick google search it seems these guys are real hit or miss if you get one that works. Before you buy, I recommend that you google for reviews and see just how many people have defective ones.again, really bummed. because now ill have to get one that works and isnt cute at all."
4,Awesome Humidifier,The Duck was bigger than I thought...lol But he works awesome and I would recommend him to anyone looking for a good humidifier :)
1,Do not waste your time...,"I bought this product because my daughter needed a humidifier and loves Hello Kitty. The humidifier is cute, and works fine as a humidifier, but the night light feature is faulty. The first light went out after a couple of weeks and the manufacturer does not make a replacement light so they sent me a new humidifier. Once again, that light went out after a couple of weeks. I'm not going to bother asking them to send me a new one since the humidifier still works, but my daughter really liked the night light feature and is disappointed that it doesn't work.So, honestly, don't waste your time on this one."
5,"Crane Adorable 1 Gallon Ultrasonic Cool Mist Humidifier, Monkey",Great little humidifier! Bought this and the owl to add some humitity to my house while burning our wood stove. No problems at all and they work great! Just the monkey one was shipped poorly but nothing broke.
2,Effective but Very difficult to clean *BLACK MOLD*,"We bought our humidifier a little over a year ago. It is quiet, cute and effective. However despite our best effort to follow the manual recommendations for cleaning and maintenance, Black Mold is an issue. I can not clean the black mold from inside the tank, It is impossible to get it go away. I can no longer use our humidifier until I can figure out how to get the mold out, for fear of making our children sick. I will likely replace it with a different humidifier."
2,Worked for only ONE month,Read the reviews and thought it would work great. Worked perfectly for the first month and now won't blow out steam. I bought it for my son who isn't even a year old and not impressed that it only worked for a month. I will look for another humidifier.
2,Works great but...,"I loved this humidifier! It worked very well for a month, and then the fan that blows the mist up died. For $40 I expected this machine to make it all winter. I am going to buy another and hope this was a fluke."
2,cute but not pratical,"This item is cute, I love penguins and I needed a humidifier so I thought this was perfect. However the mist pretty much shoots straight out then falls to the ground it doesnt fill the room properly, making it not so effective."
1,Crane Penguin Humidifier,"I have three of these same Crane humidifiers. One die after 2 months of careful use, one is still working but with loud noises, the other one got over heated while the water tank was full during my sleep at night. We don't have hard water, and i often clean the units.Becasue of the over heating problem, i dicided to not to buy any more Crane for safty reasons."
1,"Works great for a while, craps out after one season.","Loved it at first, although keeping the mold out of the base where the water is is constant work, but maybe that's part of humidifier upkeep... this thing started flickering on and off after just one winter season :( Cute as all get out, but doesn't serve it's purpose"
1,Prroduct stopped running in less than 3 months,"Had always favored the Crane brand from prior purchases.Not anymore.We had 15 inched of snow and really needed some inside humidity,and NADA . . .Hope manufacturer will replace"
2,Not very effective,"I have the penguin version, which I just received. I measured humidity using a hygrometer. At full power, after seven hours, the humidity increased a mere 10% (22 to 32 percent...still dry by many standards) in a small 10 x 10 room.I therefore cannot recommend this device...it is inefficient.At the highest output, which I used, it is very, very noisy (water bubbling). I simply do not understand the misguided positive remarks here."
2,"CRANE Ee-8189 ULTRSONIC COOL MIST HUMIDIFIER- OWL, BROWN - A REVIEW","I PURCHASED THE CRANE Ee-8189 OWL HUMIDIFIER BASED ON ITS VERY GOOD BUYER REVIEWS. IT JUST GOES TO SHOW YOU THAT SOMETIMES YOU CAN'T BUY A PRODUCT BASED SOLELY ON WHAT PEOPLE SAY ABOUT IT. FURTHERMORE A GOOD PERCENTAGE OF AMERICAN BUYERS ARE NUTS!!!1. THE PRODUCT IS CUMBERSOME WITH ITS THREE ODD SHAPED PARTS.2. THE PRODUCT MAKES AN ANNOYING WATER DRIPPING SOUND WHICH TAKES SOME TIME TO GET USED TO IF EVER.3. THE COOL AIR MIST IS DIRECTED STRAIGHT UP WHICH DOES NOT REALLY SPREAD THE MIST THROUGHOUT THE ROOM.4. UNLESS YOU WANT TO USE IT FOR A DORM ROOM OR YOU'RE LESS THAN A TWO YEAR OLD DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT.5. I GAVE IT TWO STARS ONLY BECAUSE IT CAME IN A NICE, CLEAN STURDY BOX. OTHERWISE IT IS TRULY A PIECE OF JUNK."
1,Cool Mist over the landfill...,"I think most of these ""Adorable"" misters end up on landfills quicker than they add moisture to the air in your room. Mine made it to three weeks. Cleaned it per the instructions, but the parts are pure Chinese junk.For every one thats returned, I'm sure most people just throw it away and try something else. There are many negative reviews for this product, but more within the last year. Originally years ago, it might have been made better. But even the Chinese now, are making their products without the slightest idea of pride or craftsmanship.Shame on CRANE for not making a very simple, uncomplicated product, right in the first place!"
3,Mildew Collector,"I empty and refill this humidifier once per day when I use it if my son is ill. It works great except that little black dots of mold/mildew are a guarantee and the only way to get rid of it is with bleach because you cannot physically scrub away the mildew in the tank since the opening is so small. Plus, mildew accumulates around the little handle on top, and even with a toothpick it is impossible to completely remove. I plan to buy a humidifier that I can scrub since I do not like to use such harsh cleaners in my home. The mildew problem is not helped by the fact that the humidifier is nearly impossible to get completely dry. I let it sit for days before putting it away in storage to give it a chance to dry, which is annoying because it is just sitting on the counter looking like clutter."
1,"Worked great for exactly 5 weeks, then stopped turning on","Great product at first and I only used it about every 3-4 days for 5 weeks, then it broke. The humidifier no longer turns on and I am just barely outside the return window. I'll end up buying another one from a different company."
3,Doesn't circulate well enough,"I ended up getting this on the recommendation of Consumer Reports magazine and the good reviews here. My major gripe with this humidifier is that I feel that the mist doesn't rise and expand enough. It kind of shoots out of the ""mouth"" and falls flat. I don't have too much experience with humidifiers but I was expecting something different. I was envisioning this mist enveloping more of the room instead of pretty much just falling flat. If you buy this I would advise setting it up high somewhere for maximum effect."
1,broken on arrival,I bought this last week. My 3 week old has a cold. I just took this out of the box and it won't even turn on! I am so mad. I can't get another one at this hour and my newborn will have to suffer another night. It is heart breaking hearing his snuffles and now I have no solution to help him out thanks to this poorly constructed produce. Do not buy.
3,makes too much noise,", It works well,It's cute, it's a nice small size but it gurgles thru out the night!I had no problems with this , worked immediately but I woke up thru out the night , due to my little penguin friend gurgling( as the water level went down). I've ended up turning it on for an hour or two before going to bed ,and shutting it off when I turn in."
1,CRANE,HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SUPPORT AT CRANE!!!! My humidifier cracked and they only said I could order new part. Humidifier is HARD TO CLEAN and also LEAKS!
1,It broke,I bought this on October 18th 2011 and it broke on December 6th 2011. The knob to turn it on broke and it would not turn on anymore. Not happy about that.
5,Great,I love this product. I have been using this for about 3 weeks now. My fiance bought one after me. I would highly recommend.
1,This humidifier didn't even have a chance to break.....,"I bought this humidifier from Target and brought it home to set it up immediately. I was excited by all the great reviews that the product/brand received. Unfortunately, this one didn't even have a chance to break because it never started working properly in the first place. While I have no doubt that this is a great product for those of you whom it actually worked for, I was not able to enjoy the same experience. I only gave it one star because there was not an option to leave it starless or that would have been my choice. I believe that a products that do not work properly to begin with do not deserve to be on the shelves at popular stores, only to have consumers like myself purchase them and later have to deal with the hassle of returning the product due to a defect."
5,Ours has run 12 hours a night for 20 months and counting,"We bought the cow version for our kid's room when they were born. 20 months ago. Everynight it is turned on for about 12 hours, then turned off in the morning. It works great and is fairly quiet. The noise it makes is great subtle ""white noise"" for the kids to sleep to.I would buy it again, but it's been so durable, I'm not sure when we'd have to!The downside to it is that the water reservoir is the ""head"" and you fill it by taking off the head and turning it upside down...but the top of the head is round so you have to place the head upside down in a (flat bottomed) mixing bowl to fill it, or else you have to keep one hand on it and fill it with the other hand."
2,ok for kids room...,We bought the cow and crane humidifier last year and barely used them. They are perfect for a childs small room. And hopefully they have white furniture because it DOES leave a film. This year we bought the Honeywell HCM-300T QuietCare 3-Gallon UV Tower Humidifier and L O V E it!! You can control the humidity level and it is quiet. It is easy to fill and clean & comes with a filter. When it got really dry the winter and it was like 11% in the house I can crank this baby up to 35% and then switch it down so it will auto start when it gets below the desired level. I think we bought it at our local Home Depot store.
5,My bedside pal,"I love the Penquin. I need moist air in the bedroom and it does a nice job. I especially like it because the air goes up. I have it located on a dresser a few feet from my bed and it quietly does its work. You can hear a little gurgle sound when water is being exchanged from top to bottom, but not enough to annoy me or wake me. I have another one in the living room, though the room is really too large for the unit, but I have it near my chair and the area's humidity level does goes up. I had other large room humidifies, but they had filters you have to buy....and the one that did not need new filters, well thank goodness it was warranteed for a year. I had to have FIVE replacements! I got sick of that, and bought another Penguin...and it is being used by an adult, not a child!!!"
3,"cute, seems to work, but a PAIN to fill","There seems to be a lot of people who've had very bad luck with these humidifiers. I've had the frog for about 2 months and the penguin about a week; so far so good as far as function is concerned. But my complaint with both humidifiers is the difficulty in filling them. Their shape, though cute, is very awkward to fill. The frog is somewhat easier in that I can fill him at the bathroom sink faucet and sort of rest him on his head while I screw the filter/cap back in. The penguin, being ""taller"", is filled under the tub spout. I'm leaning over trying to manage a cold wet slippery penguin body while trying to get that filter cap in. Ugh! I can see how they fall and break."
1,leaked on floor!,"Our Penguin worked well for about a year, but then the warranty ran out and BAM! It shut down and leaked water all over the floor. We emailed Crane and asked for a repair center- they said that our penguin is defective, but that since we're out of the one year warranty time, they will do nothing."
1,Hasn't worked yet!,"I can't actually comment on how well this product may work because it has never worked.We bought this humidifier intending to use it in my child's room. Having bought it late in the winter, it was left unopened in the original box because we didn't need it immediately.Now in September, we've opened it to discover that it is DOA. Doesn't work at all, no red light, no sound, no smell, no nothing.It merely looks cute.We'll either keep it as a cute door stop or it'll be in tomorrow's trash.Sadly, I've lost enough interest in it where I feel no outrage, just disappointment."
1,It did not last long,I have had the penguin humidifier for less than a year and it is already broken.Do not waste your money on getting this one.
1,Very dangerous,"I bought this for my daughter's room.After several months' use, mist did not come. I opend it and check what is the problem.Problem is, it uses small brushless fan to blow mist. once it is broken mist come to fan room and burn fan's motor. I checked out voltage from control board. it was 30V but fan is for 18V. In the view of safety and durablity, it is poor."
3,Not effective,I am not sure if all Ultrasonic humidifiers are like this one!It produces good amount of visible steam like stuff but even after using for overnight the water level is just one inch is reduced. The full tank came for 3 nights. I am not sure where from the steam is coming? I think it may not be a real water micro particles which should humidify the air. The hygrometer on my wall does not show any reading improvement it was at 50% and it still shows 50% after running the Penguin for several ours.
2,Cute but leaked!,"The Crane Hello Kitty humidifier Leaked the very first 2 days. Returned it for a refund already.Bought this item for my 3yr old who couldn't wait for it to arrive. Looked cute in her room and she loved it as a night light too. It looked fine in the morning when i went to shut it off but by noon the water had somehow leaked onto the bookshelf it was on. Adjusted the O-ring and tightened the water reservior cap and tested it one more night..same leaky result. A real shame as we really wanted this to work. Got to add that we also own the Crane spongeBob humidifer...over a year now. No issues there and our son loves it.If you like to pretend you did not read this review about the Hello Kitty humidifier and all the other negative reviews on amazon and[...],...at least make sure you are buying it from a merchant that will give you no hassle with returns/exchanges. Good luck."
2,Get what you pay for,"We mainly used this unit for our baby's room at night so he could sleep better. This unit worked awesome as the review say (quiet, lots of mist, simple) for the first 3 months. Plenty of mist, cute and simple to use. Everything seemed perfect. We changed and cleaned the unit following the instructions but there was build up on ring that create the mist and it stopped working.The company replaced the unit under warranty and I had to pay for shipping. They sent me a complete replacement which was nice, but I was without a unit for several weeks. The second worked great too for about 3 months. we stopped using it for a few months and when we started again it would only work when tilted slightly.I will be trying a different unit now because I need something that is more durable."
3,Good while they last,"This adorable unit quietly puts out a nice cloud of moisture. The yellow-green light can be turned off.The big drawback is that the water tank is not well constructed. I have had to return one and have to keep patching the second one to keep it operational. It even ships with a notice and sticker warning you not to fill it beyond two-thirds. The water tank handle breaks the first time someone forgets and holds the tank by it. When it crashes to the floor, you will probably spring your first leak. Always hold the tank, not the handle or arms."
3,"Cute humidifier for kids, worked great... when it worked.","This is a nice cool mist humidifier at a reasonable price for the kids. Of course my daughters love a Hello Kitty humidifier in their rooms. It puts out a good amount of mist and holds a large enough amount of water to make it through maybe 2 or 3 nights without refill depending on the setting you have it on.We had this humidifier for maybe 4 months before it stopped working though. We have well water with a small amount of iron in it. It would build up a film in the humidifier that we would have to clean out maybe once a week. I can't fault Crane though, we called them up and they had us cut the cord and sent us a new humidifier. Good customer service."
2,Just Stopped,"I bought this humidifier for my daughter because she desperately wanted a Moo Cow toy and this was so functional and cute. She loved it. I had a basic cone style one from Crane that has lasted for ages so I thought this would be a good buy. Unfortunately it just stopped working over a month ago. No warning sign, nothing we can find wrong with it... just stopped! I bought a Penguin one for my infant's room and a similar issue has occurred so I am quite disappointed with this brand now. Very short shelf life for the fun kids ones it seems."
1,spongebob,"After probably ten to fifteen uses, our Spongebob model stopped working. Lights still come on, and we can hear the motor running, but no mist comes out. Seemingly this isn't an isolated occurrence, will not be purchasing from this company again."
2,not as good as it introduced,"I got the penguin one. However, they probability sent me an old version of the penguin. OK, it is quiet. BUT it is not so powerful! I saw other buyers videos from the comments, but maybe ONLY that version of PENGUIN is powerful enough. I actually didn't see the strong mist came from penguin, the mist was weak!"
3,backwords elephant,"Crane cool mist Elephant shaped humidifier when put together into operating mode, the feet and head are backwards. The feet point to the back and the head points to the front. It works well."
1,What a film left!,"From the moment I turned it on it left a chalkie blueish film on my tv, furniture etc. Sent it back!!"
1,Model No Good,"This model broke within a day of receiving, but the other two versions seem to be operating well after two weeks. I recommend the Penguin."
1,Only Worked for 1 Month,"Purchased the SpongeBob Cool Mist Humidifier for my son's room. The unit stopped working completely (doesn't even light up) 30 days after set-up, and of course my returning window expired a week ago.PRODUCT = FAIL"
1,Customer service problems!,The 2nd humidifier they shipped works fine... The first one had a crack and leaked. I returned it via UPS. Two weeks later Amazon said they didn't have it. I spent a LONG time on the phone and thought it was straightened out. 30 days after the order I got another e-mail saying they charged my credit card because I didn't return the first one. I spent another LONG time on the phone with customer service. They promise me it will be taken care of. Why do I not believe them?
1,Quit working after a month - unable to return.,"This humidifier worked wonderfully for the month it functioned - easy to clean, easy to fill, and it's cute! However - after a month of normal use it fell apart.When I went to bed last night, the elephant was puffing out mist from its trunk as it had been daily - but when I woke up this morning, no mist was coming out (even though the reservoir was 1/2 full) and water was all over the nightstand. When I picked up the reservoir, water leaked out the sides, and the cap fell apart in my hands when I unscrewed it to inpsect the machine.It had not been dropped and had been used exactly according to the instructions. I can't return it because the return-period expired two weeks ago. :("
4,"Works great, really cute","I bought the elephant at target when my 3 year old got croup. It's a great humidifier. Amount of mist that you want to come out is fully adjustable and you can direct it with the elephant's trunk. It's super, super quiet. The barely audible ""glug, glug"" sound that happens every once in a while when the water goes down a level may possibly bother the lightest sleeper. Haven't had any leaks or cracks so far but it's only been a week. The only drawback that I see to this and every other humidifier that I've seen is that it's hard to thoroughly clean and dry the tank with the little hole it has for an opening. It would be nice to be able to screw off the top of the tank to really get in there."
2,not so great,i bought two of this brand. the frog shape one works great for already 1 year. the kitty shape one broke in about 1 week. it generated loud grinding noise. i had to return it.
3,OKay purchase!,"I bought this product because my 4 year old daughter loves Hello Kitty and has asthma and frequent nose bleeds. I was so happy when it arrived in 3-4 days and I was ready to use it immediately. However, the filter needs to be separately purchased and a piece of the humidifier was broken which caused the water to leak. After some super glue and filter purchases, the humidifier works fine! I think the purchase is worth no more than $15!"
5,Too cute and functional humidifier!,"I think this is the cutest humidifier ever! Ordered for daughter's room...the mist comes out of the ears, there is a nightlight, and you can adjust the output! LOVE IT!"
1,2 broke within a few months,"We bought this item, and it broke within a few months (the knob wouldn't ""click"" off so you couldnt turn it on or off). Then we purchased another one, and it broke within one month (this time it started making noises and it just blows air, not moisture)."
2,Disappointing Dragon Shape Crane Humidifier,"I have two similar humidifiers purchased in Japan (frog and polar bear.) I was eager to have the dragon for my office. Unfortunately, the Crane version is inferior to my Japanese brand (Hirotec.) The plastic is much flimsier and the mist is minimal from the Crane humidifier, even using a voltage converter. Would not purchase another Crane humidifier."
1,Loved it...until it stopped working,"After lots of research, we finally settled on buying the Frog Crane humidifier for our little baby's room. We placed it on a dresser, kept the water tank full, and cleaned it once a week. We were happy with it, and it was a cute accessory to our little baby's room. But alas, like many other reviewers, after 60 days our lovely little frog just stopped working. I called Crane customer support and they offered little help. So now I'm back on the search for a good humidifier. However, this time, I'll trade cute for functional."
3,Cute until fan died,"I loved watching the mist come out of Hello Kitty's ears. However, recently the fan that pushes the mist out died and as this was a gift, I have no proof of purchase and am out of luck. I would say, be careful to not place it on a plush surface (I imagine makes fan work harder and get hot?) and not to get water in the part of the base that carries air out from the fan and other electronics (marked with a crossed out faucet). Save your receipt! Not the most hardy humidifier, but served its purpose."
4,Great for college students!,"I bought the Crane Penguin Cool Mist Humidifier for my dorm room, and it is one of the better investments I have made. Most students know that living in a dorm room can be tough, especially with the dry and stale air. It can be really difficult to sleep in a room like that, so a humidifier is a good plan and this one is perfect for my designed single. It's quiet enough to not bother me while I'm sleeping, and it keeps me from coughing/waking up incredibly thirsty in the middle of the night. And the one-gallon size is neither too big nor too small. Oh, and it is completely adorable and satisfies my obsession with penguins. :)I gave it 4 stars because mine is a little leaky. Nothing that can't be solved with a dining hall tray underneath it, but it is a little annoying."
1,Not reliable and therefore not recommended,"After our initial purchase of this Elephant shape humidifier, less than 45 days in, it started making a really loud fan noise from the underside fan and would inconsistently start fanning loudly when we ran it - unfortunately, this often happened at night and woke our heavy-sleeping daughter up (we live in NYC on First Ave.). We promptly returned it to Amazon and got a replacement which died after 34 days with no just cause. This was on a flat surface, atop a dresser, and was consistently refilled. Because it was beyond the first 30, we couldn't re-return it to Amazon and now we have a dead unit.All the negative reviews on Amazon mention one or both of these issues so I can't in good conscience recommend this to anyone. You do get what you pay for and we have purchased a Germ Guardian H2000 model which is higher-priced, but also larger and doesn't seem to have on-going quality issues.Germ Guardian H2000 Manual Ultrasonic Humidifier"
4,Cute but Roomy Frogy at an Affordable Price,"The same model has been selling in Korean websites at almost half of the price here. Considering logistics cost and power volt difference, I decided just to buy this cute frog on this site.Pros:Its water tank can hold 1 galon, which is pretty large enough quntity for any room.Its cute design can be friendly to anybody and a good interior accessory.The price is affordable.It performs relatively well.Cons:The ejection holes should be redesigned to prevent any vapors just from falling down to the ground. It need a more adjustable ejection part.The tank holder is week and poorly finished.The LED power light is so bright that bothers night sleep."
4,Problems with distributor,"This humidifier was highly recommended to me. It works ok as long the the mist is in the air.The problems was items being shipped from Sparks, NV. I had to return two orders before I received one in near perfect condition. The feet of the models I received showed wear.I do not know what is going on, but when I asked amazon to intervene to insure I was buying a new one, nothing happened."
5,crane cow humidifier,I bought this humidifier and used it while on a trip in Las Vegas. I was pleasantly surprised by the output of mist and how quiet it was. I use it when my daughter is sick. It helps her to breathe and sleep better. I bought 4 online to give away as gifts and they love it.
1,"Bad quality, died after 1 day","Original review Oct 2009:Bought the green frog, cute and very quiet. Produced lots of mist without white dust (I use filtered water). But it only worked for ONE day. There are 2 lights, green for when it's working, and orange when there's not enough water. After the perfect 1st day, then orange light went on even with a full tank of water and stopped producing any mist. Very disappointed at the inferior quality. Returned the frog and bought a penguin, I hope this one lasts.Update Feb 2013:Bought a blue penguin from the same manufacturer, it lasted 7 months and started leaking at the bottom. Tossed it. Bought a yellow duck and a gray elephant and they both lasted years. I guess it's hit and miss with these humidifiers. For some reason, the duck and frog (weaker mist from 2 spouts) are quiet but elephant and penguin are louder (strong mist from 1 spout). Can you tell I'm obsessed with animal humidifiers? lol"
2,died on me after a year,"i dont know anything about what other things a humidifier is suppose to do. i just want a simple one because my heater is making me wake up w/ a dry throat, lips and skin. so i bought the first one i saw at the store (i forgot w/c store) which is this.. it worked fine..it did what it's suppose to do..have to add water every night since i use the the highest setting most of the time (i would end up still having dry lips and throat if i didnt)...unfortunately it died on me after a year..am not buying this again.."
2,"Cute, but not real effective","I purchased this product because this winter has been particularly cold and the heat in our condo sucks the moisture out of air. I bought this particular humidifier based on the fact that it received high marks from other reviewers. Is it cute? Yes. Is it easy to operate? Yes. Is it inexpensive? Yes. But, I felt it wasn't terribly effective, so I bought a hygrometer to measure the humidity in the air and was disappointed, but not surprised, at the results. Leaving this humidifier on high all day in a small bedroom with the door closed never raised the humidity percentage more than 10%-15%. Perhaps, these results will remain the same with another humidifier, but I'm guessing not. I plan on purchasing another humidifier (no animal shapes this time) to see if there's a marked improvement in humidity levels."
3,This particular one was OK.,"We had purchased every other animal in this product line and had problems with all of them, except this one and the elephant. If you keep the unit on high, the water settles on the night stand and leaves a lot of moisture. We have to keep it at a medium setting so our furniture doesn't get ruined. Our kids do find it cute though, so that's always a plus."
4,Great and Cute Humidifier,"Because my nursery is decorated green and with frogs, this went perfectly! It is so cute! It also works well...my son was having a lot of congestion and coughing before and now that we use this everynight, he has seemed to sleep so much better.My only quirk about it is that it doesn't make noise! My daughter has another humidifier that makes some white noise that helps her sleep, so I was a little dissappointed that this one was so quiet. I know that is great for some, but my kids like the little bit of noise to sleep. If you like quiet, you will love this one."
3,had to fix it to get it to work,"The light for the unit didn't turn on at all. There's 2 screws right where the power cable comes into the unit, took off the small hatch and saw that one crimp on the rocker switch had slipped off. After fixing, the humidifier works fine."
2,adorable but it doesn't work,"as cute as the humidifier is, it's useless if it doesn't work. it worked for about 3-4 days, i emptied it, cleaned it and it worked sporadically. i had read the reviews and had hoped for a winner, but i didn't fight it, i just returned it."
1,I thought I would like it,"The capacity of the tank is good and the humidifier looks good. However the mist doesnt shoot up above the spout. It beats the purpose of having a humidifier. My eyes are still soar and dry in the mornings. Added to that, It leaks and it spills water all over the place. The carpet becomes completely wet for 3x3ft around. If I had to walk over a soaked place every morning, its frustrating."
1,Absolutely unreliable. Cheap fan breaks into loud buzz,"I bought one of these five years ago and it worked well for a long time. Bought two recently and both of them after a while started making a loud buzz. The first one after 5-6- months, the second after less than two months of actual use.It is clearly the fan, the only moving part, and when it starts making noise there is nothing one can do, just turn it off. It is loud enough to wake up children and adults and definitely too loud to stand even when awake.Clearly the components are not up to the task and the manufacturer is putting garbage into these things.It is disappointing because of the waste of money and because we like it when it works but is definitely too expensive for playing hit-or-miss or replacing it after two months."
1,Stopped working within a year of purchase,I bought this penguin shaped blue-white crane humidifier not even a year ago and it has stopped working. What a waste of money. I am now looking for something else. Save your money! Do not buy something that won't even last!
2,Didn't work...,The first one that got delivered just didn't work period. It would turn on but no steam would come out...trouble shooting tips did not work. Once we sent it back and got the replacement...it worked but the base has a HUGE crack in it :( Just not sure it is worth purchasing something like this online.
3,Cute but broke after 3 weeks,"We loved the humidifier when it arrived and our daughter enjoyed it for a few weeks, but then it started making a grinding noise that got worse, and we opened up the bottom and the problem was the fan, so my husband tried to fix it and it works better now but we still can't turn it up all the way. If it gets worse again we will call Crane. Disappointing."
5,best humidifier,this is the best humidifier i've ever owned. it sctually humidifies the air without making everything wet. i bought it for our new daughter but since she's been in our bedroom i set it up in there. i'm now shopping for another for our living room and one for our bedroom when she moves to her nursery.
4,Super Cute,I love it! The bubling noise soothes me to sleep like white noise. It's super cute as well!The negative... mist seems to leak out everywhere instead of only from the beak. That's fine.... whatever... just means theres a wider range of dispersal.
4,"Excellent! Easy to use, green light a little bright.","First of all, extremely cute. Kids will love having it in their rooms. Extremely easy to use -- just pull it out of the box and go. No filters to mess with, other than the optional demineralization filter, which just replaces the screw on top. Great output. Overall, excellent. I just had to block the green light because it is a little bright."
1,Did not work on delivery,"Unfortunately, this humidifier did not work. I returned it. Based on other reviews here, I am not having it replaced, but will get a different product. Disappointed."
3,"Perfect product, if it worked","I love the design of this product. Far superior than other humidifiers. It worked great for the first 3 weeks and I was very happy with it. I followed the care and operation instructions precisely b/c I read other reviewers had problems with this product. Last night, I started having the same problem as others - mist forms in body, but does not rise up and out. Just swirls and eventually leaves a wet mess. I'm waiting to hear back from Crane, but since it's still within the return window on Amazon, I'm trying a replacement. Would love to give this 5 stars, but am reserving higher marks till I try the replacement. Hoping #2 lasts and performs, b/c it really had been highly effective in delivering good mist. So easy to use and clean compared to others. Takes up less space too. No awkward big basin to fill. Easy to fill in bathroom sink."
2,not good for the long haul,"have owned 3 of these units in the last 2 years, one developed a noisy fan and now our 3rd unit developed a leak 10 days beyond the amazon 30 day return date. Generally units seem fine for a small room but now with 2 of 3 down, reliability becomes unacceptably low."
1,"Cute, but dysfunctional","We bought the Frog and at first it seemed great because it is quiet and cute, but every night for the first week, it has stopped working in the middle of the night and as an already sleep deprived Mom with a newborn, I have been up multiple times a night fixing it. For reasons I can't figure out, even though the water level is normal, the adjustable dial is at medium and everything is set up right, it just stops working, causing the red light to go on and for it to make a different noise that wakes me up. I jiggle it a bit, lift the top part up and put it back down and it works fine, but I would only buy this if you don't mind getting up a few times each night to make it work again."
4,Cute and quite,"I bought this (pink pig) three years ago and never used it much. The first time I used it it leaks but not now. I guess I wasn't using it correctly back then. It is pretty quite, with a little bit water dripping noise (quite/natural enough to be ignored). For your information, I in general cannot tolerate much of the noise while sleeping. I can hear notebook HD noise, static noise from speakers if not powered off ect. But this one doesn't annoy me at all.Overall, I like it. Plan to buy another one."
1,Don't Buy,"This humidifier stopped working after 6 months. Also, the mist out of these humidifiers does not blow out very high so the ground around them gets very wet unless you set on very light setting. Would not purchase again."
2,The quality is not good!,The Humidifier sometimes have a very loud noise when it started to run. you need to try several times to make it operate in a moderate noise. And it always has plastic smells even after 6 months.
1,Don't recommend,"We actually got 2 of these of our baby registry and figured we'd use one in our bedroom instead of returning. Big mistake, I should've exchanged it so I wasn't left with two broken ones! We had these in 2 seperate areas (nursery and master bedroom) and in both areas, the mist all fell to the floor and COMPLETELY soaked the carpet or the night stand they were sitting on. Since we of course didn't want all the mildew soaking up in the carpet, so then we figured we'd jerry-rig it and put a towel underneath both of them... BIG mistake. This stopped the fans completely and broke them both!"
2,"Okay at first, then broken","I bought this humidifier for my daughter's room. It worked fine for a short time, maybe a week or so, and then it started making a lot of noise. I could jiggle or tap it and it would stop for a day or two, then it started doing it constantly and nothing I could do would make it stop. It was a really loud grinding noise, definitely not something we could ignore. I also found that you couldn't turn the mist up very high or it would condense and leak out from under the face plate. We just returned it rather than trying to get another and I am going to try something else."
1,hunk of junk!!,"I should not have let the ""cuteness"" sway my decision. This is the 2nd night using this and I'm glad I kept the box, because it's going back tomorrow. I practically have to beat it to get it to work. I literally have to bang it around and clunk it from side to side to get it to ""engage"" and start working. Earlier when I went to refill it, i lifted off the top and water went everywhere all over the floor, all over me and the shelf it was on. And what is the point of the handle, if they tell you ""don't carry by handle""... I'm so disappointed. And what's with the pictures of Correct and Wrong?? The pictures are TERRIBLE!! You can't see what the difference is!!! I will be replacing this tomorrow with a Vicks."
3,Inconvenient to refill (not good for lazy person),"I bought it last year and have used it for about 1 year. Overall the humidifier works OK. It is quiet ( this is my first humidifier, so I don't know whether it is quieter or nosier than other humidifiers). It is very small (1 gallon), so it only works for a small bedroom (about 18 square meter). The thing I don't like it is that it is very inconvenient to refill it: the inlet is at the bottom, so you need to hold it all the time when you refill it. 1 Gallon of water can only last for about one day, so it is not good for a lazy person.BTW, I used the filter for 1 year and never changed it. It still works well."
1,"Cute, but it leaks!","Of course all the humidifiers in this line are adorable, and when they function properly, they are very effective. However what I've found with this elephant humidifier is that a small stream of water leaks out of the bottom of the nose and down the front of the unit, right into the dial, or onto my table. I tried sealing it and stuffing a tissue up into the nose, but nothing is working. Looks like my next fix is a new humidifier. This item is way too expensive for me to be waking up to a puddle of water on my table. It is absolutely not worth the hassle or the water stains."
1,Do not purchase this.,It stopped working after three days. I should have listened to the other reviews. It is a waste of money.n
2,"pretty and cut, but doesn't produce humidity!","Yes, it's so cute as a humidifier, and it really makes a lot of fog. But, I felt very thirsdy and need to drink twice during a night! The same as without the kitty. So, the only way is to return it. And I am still looking for a good and effective humidifier now."
3,great until it stopped working right,"i've been using my elephant humidifier less than 2 months and it stopped working correctly. green light goes on, but no mist. my husband ""fixed it"" by lifting top part off and seeing there was too much water in the base so it's ok again, but i have a feeling it's going to go on the fritz again. also, when i cleaned it last i noticed in the base, black paint or whatever it is came off like it was mold. (that's what i thought it was at first) so i rubbed more of it off. when i dried it and took a close look, i saw that it was the finish on the ring, rather than mold. don't know if that makes a difference in its operation or safety. i am contacting the seller to see if i can exchange it, but i'm disappointed it didn't last long"
2,Disappointed.....,"We have three of these humidifiers, the elephant, the penguin and the cow. Have had them for 6 months or so. In the last two weeks, both the penguin and cow have stopped working all together and the elephant is the sole survivor.When we got them, I thought they were amazing, quiet and did the job. Now I am deciding if I should go out and buy two more or pick another brand.Oh and be careful, I think the steam from my sons killed his DVD player on his TV as it gets caked with the white stuff....."
4,Simple and Easy,"We have the penguin humidifier in my son's room, on the window sill. It seems to work really well, keeping him from coughing and getting congested during the winter months when the heat drys out the air. Its about two feet above his changing table, and I haven't had the problem of the pad being damp in the morning because the output mist is adjustable. And I haven't seen any white dust (I don't know if its applicable to this machine, but I know some humidifiers can produce it).I did wish it had a filter like the Air-O-Swiss models (or like a Brita), but for now I fill it up in the bathtub or in the sink. And its got a handle on both sides of the water tank, so its very easy to carry when full."
5,Best Purchase,"It is very humid in the southeast. So we are used to the moisture in the air. However, during the winter months- using the heater- get can get very stuffy and dry. I wasn't sleeping well and was very restless. After getting the humidifier- I sleep GREAT! And my kids love the elephant shape. I definitely recommend it!"
5,Incredible Value,"I'm amazed at what a great product this really is. I shopped at Costco a while back and got a honeywell humidifier, only to be disappointed by the filter that wicked the water up, and quickly got clogged by the minerals in the water. I trashed that a while back, and for a while browsed for a good humidifer WITHOUT a filter, and without problems. This one is perfect! The mist it produces is fine enough that anything nearby doesn't get soaked since it evaporates it. The tank is large and lasts a lot longer than the claimed ""11 hours"" on the box. And the frog just fits in the room, not something that'll go out of style anytime soon like having an Ionic-Breeze might. It's kinda cute and timeless. Love it."
1,"Glug, glug, glug -- waterfall!","Worked fine for the first 24 hours I owned it; I was so excited! I'll admit it's adorable. But as I sat studying my lines for the show I'm in after refilling it for the first time, all of a sudden a waterfall began down the front of my dresser; the entire contents of the body had leaked, soaking the full sized towel folded underneath and causing a waterfall down the front of my dresser. Apparently the nebulizer was incorrectly positioned or something of that nature, because when I did it again with the bottom unscrewed over the sink, all the water again gushed out from around the edges of the metal plate, emptying every last drop of water through the vents in the bottom.When I returned the product to Amazon for another, they said they had discontinued the item and instead gave me a refund plus $20. I think this because so many people have had to return the item that they're stopping its sale soon... could also be why it's discounted!"
1,Tried twice hoping the first was a fluke... both gave out in less than 10 days.,"We tried the elephant first. We loved it!!! It was quiet, didn't leak, and so cute! It worked great almost nonstop for 7 days. Then it started to get louder. And louder. And LOUDER! No good for a nursery, so we took it back and exchanged it for the penguin. Exact same thing all over again! It seemed perfect at first. And this time we made it to almost 10 days before it started that ominous whirring that heralded the last humidifier's demise. Too bad, but I'm afraid this product stinks. My assumption is that the other (more positive) reviews were written before their unit died on them."
5,Stcking with crane products,"I am happy once again with another crane humidifier. We bought this one to put in my daughters ""princess""themed room, and it fits right in. I have bought 2 others in the past and am always happy with how quiet they are and how they dont worry me about being around the children. The cool mist takes that worry to rest. It gets the job done. I wouldnt hesitate buying another if need be."
4,Works great!,"This product definitely helped me sleep more soundly. The only problem I have is with the cleanup process. It is a little annoying having to empty the water from multiple sources on a daily basis. Other than that, great!"
3,Spring rusted in less than a month,Update: I emailed Crane. They told me they do lot testing on the springs and that they haven't had this happen. They replaced the part for free. I just installed it tonight. I will reassess in one month. I changed my rating from 1 to 3 based on the very quick response from the customer service team.I had the one light frog humidifier for 2 years and it worked perfectly. The motor broke and I bought a new one but the new frog humidifier had two lights. The spring rusted in less than one month. I am so disappointed. I will definitely keep an eye out for the one light humidifier. DO NOT BUY THE ONE WITH TWO LIGHTS. I want to return it but I will only get 50% return of the cost plus I would have to pay shipping which is probably not worth it.
1,just used it for one week and it is out of order,I just bought this humidifier but it stopped working within one week. The green light is on but the fan stops running. No vapor comes out. This is my 3rd humidifier from this brand and all of them don't have good quality. I am very disappointed about this brand
2,Mine ALSO stopped working after two months,"I should've read more of the reviews that got one stars before purchasing. It is an adorable humidifier, and it worked well for the first two months, but then stopped working after the second month. I just read a few other reviews and apparently it is common.Get a different humidifier, don't get sucked into this one simply because its cute and affordable, because you'll end up purchasing a different one anyways.John"
3,Concerned about mildew,"Although this product works great as a humidifier, I am frustrated by the inability to dry the tank after use. I've left it hanging for a week in different positions, tried drying it with a hairdryer, to no avail. The opening to the tank is much too small to reach in to wipe the inside of the tank after use. If this company can come up with a way to get access to easily dry the inside of the tank, then I would give this 5 stars. At this point, I do not feel comfortable re-using this product without properly disinfecting it prior to use, since mildew and mold buildup is guaranteed."
1,Hello Kitty is cute but not functional.,I actually have had a couple Crane humidifiers and they work great. I let my daughter pick out hers and she picked Hello Kitty. The first one we had worked great for a couple of months then suddenly started making a loud noise from the fan. So I returned it and got another one. The same thing happened and I returned it. I've gone through at least 4 of them. So I'm sticking to the other models instead of Hello Kitty. I had a duck and a frog and they both work great.
5,Nice cute humidifier,"The crane humidifier is very easy to use and adorable too. It's a bit noisy but it doesn't distract me at night. One of the thing that you have to keep in mind is to clean up regularly and when you start to operate it, make sure not to crank it up too high which can cause foggy room. This piece of apparatus is worthy of my money for sure."
4,Really like it,Really like this humidifier! Like that it's so quite and that it gives the air a little mist without making it feel wet. I just haven't figured out how to refill it without dripping some water but would still recommend it!
5,I love elephants,"At first, I had the setting on too high and I was coughing the next day, but then I figured it out and turned it down and it works great for me. And it's super quiet and have to fill it up like once a week!"
2,A little dissapointed,I bought this humidifier in part because it promised not to drop water around it as it misted. I have had to place a towel under it and under the mist emission to protect the expensive hardwood floors in the room it's needed in. It has served its purpose well in terms of effect.
4,Cool,"Very nice and compact, takes up minimal surface area. Quiet operation and goes a long time without needing a refill. Has a knob on the front that controls the amount of vapor it puts out. The only negative I have about this is having to flip it over to fill it; this is a very minor inconvenience, but it would be nice to be able to just bring a pitcher of water in and fill it."
3,White dust everywhere...even with the filter.,"These units are cute. They work adequate as a cool-mist humidifier. They are quiet as well. But I had the choice of either using distilled water in it or returning it, so I had to return it.I bought the unit with the Crane De-mineralization Filter because I hate the white dust these cool-mist humidifiers generate. I don't use the tap water straight either. I used filtered water off of a Brita filter. I figured with the two stages of filtering, it'll cut down on the white dust. It really didn't. My humidifier was covered in white dust after one night's use. I thought maybe if I break the unit in, it might help...but after a week, still the same.So if you are sensitive about the white dust, these aren't your best bet. I'll probably switch to the evaporative cool mist types instead of these."
1,Broke after 3 uses,I bought the penguin humidifier because it was cute and my daughter liked it. We used it for three nights in her room and then put it away (cleaned according to directions). Two weeks later I took it out again and the motor was broken. The company hotline was very unhelpful. I do not recomment this product to anyone.
5,Mooooooo!!!!!,"I purchased this after seeing the elephant at my brother's house. Not only is this humidifier adorable, it made a world of difference in my room! No longer was it difficult to breathe! It also got rid of the itchy, dry eyes that no medication could! Directions say not to put it on a wooden surface because of leakage. However, all of my furniture is made of wood and fortunately the humidifier (to date) hasn't leaked at all! A tank of water lasts roughly a day and a half if set somewhere between low and medium. I imagine it will need to be filled more frequently if set at higher settings. I would recommend buying this if you are an allergy sufferer like myself."
4,Very Cute and Functional,My daughter chose this humidifier when we needed to get one to help her with nasal dryness. She insisted on the frog and she loves it. At first I did have difficultly getting the mist to come out of the holes above the eyes. But it finally started working. I discovered that if you turn it to it's highest setting you can see the mist better and then you can turn it down to the correct level you want. I had to put it on a wooden tv tray in my daughter's room since it could not be on carpet (carpet would block the vents which on the very bottom of the unit). But it is working well there. I also really like how the water tank can fit under a sink facuet. Makes filling it easier since I can you the bathroom (which is closer to my daughter's room). For the price I paid here on Amazon (which was cheaper than elsewhere) I am very pleased with this product.
4,Good for Price,"This product was worth it for its price. It does its job, if you fill it up you won't have to fill it again for about two days if you leave it on during while you are asleep."
1,did not work at all,"I usually don't write reviews but this product was so terrible I had to say something. We bought it for our new baby's room based on all the good reviews but it did not create mist, was very loud and didn't actually work at all. It might look cute but the head of the penguin didn't even sit properly on the body. It's a huge waste of money. The motor was so loud I couldn't imagine putting it in a baby room and the mist never made it out of the head despite the dial being on the highest."
1,Simply does not work,"Doesn't work at all. Running at maximum level for 24 hours has zero impact on the humidity level in my apartment, absolutely none."
3,mixed review,"I have two of these, the elephant and the panda. The elephant works wonderfully, and we really enjoy having it. The panda was our second purchase, and I cannot say we were as satisfied. The flow knob didn't actually control the knob; the output at the lowest setting was the same as the output at the highest setting. Not to mention that the painted eyes smeared when touched. Neither of these issues existed with the elephant so hopefully it was just a single occurrence. We are returning the panda and getting a frog instead. Hopefully it will function as well as the elephant."
4,Great for small room/childs room,We had previously been using several different kinds of Vicks humidifer's but all of the broke within a month. This is not only cute but it puts out cold steam so children can't get burned. It is easy to fill and seems to last the amount stated if not longer. The dial makes it very easy to maintain a certain amount of humidity in the room at all times. I have it in a smaller room and it isn't on high so I don't doubt it could handle a larger room. I have had this item for several months and have yet to have any problems.
4,Love it!,"I love this. It is so quiet, you don't even know it is there. It certainly helps with my sinuses over night. Get it!"
2,You can't prevent it from soaking the surroundings at high,"This is almost useless. At high it will soak the area it is near. At low, well, it's too low. I have a ceiling fan on to circulate it and that helped. Nevertheless, I will return it to Target. The evaporative type is better. The problem with the units I had had once was that they were loud. The fan did turn off when the desired humidity was reached...a good thing which this does have...a bad thing. It did add humidity. Keep your box and reciepts on anything you purchase."
3,"love crane, but cute animal shapes break","I love crane humidifiers. I bought one for my bedroom. When my son was born I knew I was going to get him a crane humidifier and love the cute animals it came in. I got him the frog since i had decorated the room in turtles and other greens.Unlike my traditional blue and white unit, this produced very little ""smoke"" even on high. My son is now 5 months and his humidifier has stopped working. I am now spending another $40+ to get him a blue and white unit. As cute as those animal shapes are I would never get another one. I would still recommend crane to anyone though."
3,Good for small spaces,"I bought this humidifier 5 weeks ago. So far it has worked good and I do not find it difficult to handle. The place where I use it is about the max size specified for this product (250 sq. ft). I would recommend this humidifier to be used in smaller spaces, because even when running at full capacity its capability to increase humidity is very limited - in my case it takes up to 4h to raise humidity by 1 percentage point."
3,Decent humidifier for the price,"Attractive and decent price. Louder than expected. The cap (duck's head) doesn't fit the tank well and is easily bump off. Plus, the cool mist seep through the edge of the cap instead of coming out of the vents completely. Filling the tank is cumbersome."
1,ridiculous design error,"Think these are cute products, bought the duck and penguin, one each for our kid's rooms. While they work fine to spray the mist, the ""optional demineralization filter cartridge"" doesn't fit in either of these models. In the duck, the handle is in the way and the hole may be too shallow. In the penguin, the diameter of the hole is too small. I don't know if the filter will fit in any of the other models, but my suggestion is don't waste your money unless you weren't going to buy the filter anyway."
4,"Very cute, quiet and it works but...",My kids loved it because it was so cute but they have a larger room so I put it on a high setting. The next morning the floor was soaked! I'm not sure that the moisture is getting into the air because it all seemed to be on the floor. I'll try using it at a lower setting tonight to see if it does better there. The idea about putting a tray under it is a good one that I might have to try.
4,Crane makes the best humidifier!,"We are now on our second frog - the first died because our water is appliance-killing hard and I did not take proper precautions. Frog is almost silent - there is a gentle whirring from the fan, and sometimes the trickle of condensing water can be heard, but nothing unpleasant. We also have the penguin and for some reason that one is very noisy, almost as loud as cheap drugstore brands. I'm convinced that something does not fit quite right, perhaps the filter. Penguin works just fine and the white noise of him cranking along is comforting to my 3 year old.I have tried many humidifiers, and these cute ones are by far the best."
3,Leaks like a seive,"As a humidifier, this gadget does the job well. However, trying to fill or move the humidifier will result in drenched feet. The main reservoir is shoddily constructed, and the plastic fits together poorly at the top of the device. So when you remove the reservoir and turn it over in order to fill it, any water remaining (which there'll always be) pours out the seals at the top.I'd recommend finding a different humidifier. However, you could get lucky and pick one of these up that doesn't leak... This device'd be 5-starred if I'd been so lucky. ;)"
5,Smooth and quiet,"I bought 2 units from Amazon, but one came cracked on the bottom.It is an excellent humidifier.It is so quiet I often thought it is off.One thing users should note is to get it elevated.The mist doesn't boost so high if you leave it on the floor.My daughter has serious dry skin so I elevate this next to her bed on top of the desk and you can see the mist gently fall on her face and body while she sleeps.Great product. Highly recommended."
4,It is ok,"OK, not great; this is the second one, first was defective and replaced pretty quick with this second one we have now; what's nice about it is that it is very quiet; what's bad is that it holds too much water below the water tank so whenever you need to fill up the tank you need to clean lots of water around."
5,Perfect!,"What I like about this product? Just about everything. First off, it's incredibly quiet. Second, I like that you can adjust the output (perfect for those with smaller rooms). I also like the safety auto-off feature should the water tank run dry."
1,smells very bad,"I really wanted to like these, they are just adorable. I ordered two humidifiers (frog and penguin) and both had a strong odor right out of the box. They smell was very chemical like. I decided to give one of them a try to see if the smell would fade. I even washed the frog out with vinegar thinking it would help but after running it for two nights, all it did was make my child's room smell like chemicals. They are both being returned."
1,Don't buy it !,"I bought one based on its popularity in Amazon. But the quality is extremely bad. It only works for the first month, and I found no way to make it work again. No mints come out ever. Nothing is wrong with the operation, nothing is wrong with the electricity. Just don't know what's wrong with the machine.I strongly recommend you NOT spend [...] bucks for this 30-day low quality stuff. Stay away from it."
1,"Bad results, but cute",Worked great for 2 weeks. Cleaned how/when manual suggested and 1 month later no mist. Trying to find a way to return but looks like it will cost! Bought $20 walgreens brand same time for husband and it has been much better humidifier and his still works!
3,Good product but arrived cracked,This is a great product but it arrived with a large crack in the base. Luckily it does not affect functioning.
4,Cute and easy to maintain,"This is the cutest humidifier I've ever owned. Easy to clean, it humidifies my bedroom comfortably."
2,Must depend on the animal,"We have a elephant and tiger. The elephant on high has no issues, the tiger on medium up insures puddles of water. It's disappointing they are so different. I would not recommend the tiger, I would recommend the elephant."
2,Does not last! Buyer beware!,"We bought this humidifier for our baby's room, running it at night when our baby slept. After running satisfactorily for a couple of months, it has now started making really loud mechanical noises when turned on, and we are afraid to leave it on for fear of it being a fire hazard (read the other review about the motor catching on fire).It was only when we tried to return it that we realized that despite it being a baby item, Amazon does not include it under the 365-day return policy like it does for other baby items. Perhaps it is because they have had too many cases of people returning it because it just doesn't last for very long. We really liked it when it worked, but now all we have is one more thing taking up space. If you only need something for very occasional use or don't mind getting a new one after two months, then this might be for you. For us we hoped to get something we could trust to leave on in our baby's room overnight, and apparently this isn't it."
3,Good and bad,"Cute, easy to use, and does its job. Difficult to keep clean even when I followed instructions. There are large areas at the bottom of the water tank that can't be reached with wipes. Yet some sort of buildup there would not simply rinse away. I used the demineralizer cartridge and the self cleaning drop ins. Did not seem to help."
4,cute and functional,"It is what it is, a humidifier but looks like our dog so it's just not an ugly thing on the ground in our room."
4,Good humidifier for baby's room,"I purchased this humidifier for my infant's room. It is easy to operate and is quiet. I did have a problem with the first humidifier. About a week or two after I started using it, I found it leaked water. The manufacturer was great and quickly sent a replacement. I just had to call the company, email them the requested information to get a return authorization number, and mail them the cut cord. The elephant looks cute in my baby's room and has a good range of mist settings. I haven't used the replacement yet but despite the inconvenience I would still recommend the product. Things break but the company provided great customer service and that means a lot to me."
5,does the job and looks good too,"I was skeptical about the performance based on the ""adorable"" appearance of this product, however I am pleasantly surprised. It is easy to assemble, and works very well. I only wish I had known the filter was sold separately but overlooking that detail was my mistake."
1,Two Defective SpongeBobs,"The first one we bought worked out of the box. My 4 yr old absolutely loved it. After a couple of weeks of use, the light stopped working (it is an LED, so it should not be burned out). We returned it and got another SpongeBob and this one did not work at all when it arrived. I suspect that the positive reviews would be negative if they waited a bit longer as these all appear to be dead on arrival or shortly thereafter. I will be avoiding all Crane products in the future."
5,Holy cow this humidifier is great!,I am so glad got this for our children's room. It really puts out a lot of mist! They love the cow design and I love that the humidifier tank is so easy to fill and doesn't need filters.
1,Impossible to clean,"Cute design and easy to fill, but it has two major problems:(1) It is impossible to clean all of the nooks and crannies of the reservoir. There are spaces that I can't clean using a toothbrush, scrub brush, paper towel or anything else, that have developed a pinkish mold which forced me to stop using this humidifier.(2) The humidifier shuts off prematurely, when there is still a shallow amount of water in the reservoir. Unless you catch this quickly, that shallow amount of water sits and grows mold.Overall, this is poorly designed."
2,Stopped putting out mist,This humidifier started out well enough. It put out mist (not much in comparison to other humidifiers) so we were happy. My son liked the nightlight and having SB in his room. Put it away after last winter and took it out about a month or so ago. It basically stopped misting after a couple of weeks and I can't figure out how to fix it. Not really worth it even though it's pretty inexpensive. I would just save your money and get a real humidifier.
3,Need's a fan,"This humidifier definitely gives out plenty of mist. It is super easy to fill and can run for quite some time on one tank. Unfortunately, the elephant trunk does not disperse the mist very well. I have to have a fan running behind it to push the mist out, or I end up with a damp spot on the floor below the humidifier (it is up on a 4 1/2 ft dresser). I sleep with a fan anyway, so it's not a huge deal, but would be annoying for someone who didn't like the noise."
2,"Really cute, but....","This is the cutest thing ever! And it works well too. The light is not too bright so it works great for a nightlight. It's quiet. My granddaughter loves it! I'm getting one for her room at her house.I wrote the above review when I first received this. It is very cute, but the lightbulb burned out shortly after we started using it and there is no way to change it as far as I can see. It's in a sealed compartment. And it's developing mildew on the inside. It definitely needs to be cleaned much more often than other humidifiers."
1,Talk about High Maintenance!,"It gets a star for being cute & matching my child's room decor, but other than that Im not crazy about it. Its pretty high maintenance and if you leave the water in there for a day, you can see bacterial growth. It says it needs to be cleaned daily, and heavily weekly...plus you can get an optional filter. I bought the filter, and the filter says it should be replaced monthly. No thanks, that is way too much work & money. I got a Vick's Humidifier that doesnt require a filter and has dishwasher safe parts. I returned this."
1,Delivered with broken water tank...useless!!!,"I would love to say that I have an idea of how this product works, but I never got a chance. When I opened the box it looked like someone else had already had it. The cord was not packaged like it would be from the manufacturer. I unwrapped the whole thing and picked up the water tank part only to find numerous cracks and a chunk of the tank missing. The chunk that was missing was not even in the box. Obviously another customer purchased it and returned it. Returns must not be checked for damage. This was extensive damage, easily noticed with a quick once over.Consumer reports rated this humidifier as the best and I have been waiting to try it. I think I will return this one and order from another supplier"
3,Ok lasted a little over a year then stopped working,"Used every night for about a year and a half. Just stopped working. Would recommend, as most humidifier don't last much longer than what we've experienced with this one."
5,"Looks cute, but isn't built cute.","Looks cute, kids love it, though hard to find a spot for it that's out of reach so they don't get tempted to play with Panda's ears, leaving their cute little bacteria on it. Expected poor construction when purchasing, but have been pleasantly surprised. Good, clear instructions as well, especially about cleaning, which is really important due to aforementioned cute little bacteria peddlers."
3,Ok Product,"This is the 4th Crane humidifier that we have purchased in 2 years. They do not last long. The fan has gone out on two of them inside of a year. This one seems to work ok; meaning no vibrations or noise. The nightlight is not bright at all, which may be good for some kids. Our daughter likes the Hello Kitty part of it, so that has worked out well. Our only hope is that it makes it through the winter."
1,Can not believe Amazon send me a used one!,"very disappointed that Amazon sent me a used one, at least has been open by other people. I bought a lot of stuff from Amazon, but I start to doubt its credibility!"
2,"Cute, but not quality","I bought both the penguin and the frog humidifiers for my boys' rooms. The frog's motor had a low whirring sound that caused one of the boys to wake up several times during the night, and he's not a light sleeper. That one was returned to Amazon right away. The penguin was quieter and worked well for about a week. Now, when turned on, the motor whirs loudly. It goes back to working quietly only after we switch it on and off several times. If you purchase one, use it right away before it's too late to return it if problems develop."
5,Amazing!,"We love this new product! It has been great for clearing up my sons colds. I would say it does seem like we have to refill it often, but it's so worth the money in the end!"
2,I guess you get what you pay for.....,"I ordered the red dragon humidifier for my 5 year old's room. I set it up etc... first off, the smell of plastic it gave off was awful. Secondly, the output was not good even on the high setting. With that smell and low output I promptly returned it. On the plus side, it was very cute and my son did like it.I am currently looking at some Air O Swiss models. Pricey but I know from past experience that they deliver and don't stink."
3,Penguin Humidifier,"We purchased the penguin model because my wife adores penguins. The first one only produced the mist for a couple of weeks. Amazon.com returns was very easy and we received our replacement within 5 days. The replacement has performed very well for several weeks now. All in all this is a good product. Easy to operate, refill and maintain. We are satisfied."
1,Died after 6 months,This humidifier worked great at first. We did have to clean it out weekly with bleach due to the mold smell but it was otherwise working well. It just died on us after 6 months of use. I haven't yet contacted the manufacturer but it sounds like I'm not the only one who had this problem.
3,"Adorable, yes, but also cumbersome","First, let me say that this penguin is every bit as cute as the picture--and the cool mist definitely helps us sleep and breathe easier during the dry winter months. But it's really annoying to refill! I was hoping for something where you just unscrew a lid and pour water in without moving the actual humidifier (just use a measuring cup or watering can to refill). Instead, I have to take off the head, pick up the torso, turn it upside down, maneuver it into my small sink, refill it, cap it, then try to plop it back onto the base without spilling any water. I've gotten better at it, but it is a nuisance. However, my toddler loves the penguin and enjoys taking the head off and putting it back on."
2,"good looking, bad performance",It's lovely and good in design. But this humidifier is only suitable for tiny rooms. It does not work well even for mid-sized rooms. You wouldn't see any improvement in humidity for all of the time if the room is big.
4,Works well as a novelty humidifier,"My 4 year old daughter loves Hello Kitty and she needed a humidifier in her room, so it is a perfect match. It works very well and quiet. The only complaint I have is that there is no built-in humidity meter for automatic shut-off. The knob allows adjustment but it doesn't shut off when the desired humidity level is reached.However, it works very well for a small bedroom and my daughter likes the night light as well. I would recommend it as a kid's humidifier for a small room."
1,unsafe,"inexplicably, this item started making a labored noise and then leaked water from the bottom. Of course, electricity and water do not go well together and so we're glad we caught it before disaster struck.We have another ---non-kid humidifier-- from the same maker that's been fine."
2,"Adorable, but only worked for one month.","The Crane penguin was indeed adorable and when it was working, it worked well. It worked for about one month then quit. I am not sure why. I took good care of it and was careful not to get any water in the motor. I have one day left to return this item, but I do not think it is worth the trouble. I may buy another one from Target as I how have four filter cartrides left and Target is nearby and has a good return policy. I am back to using my 20-year-old, ugly, Samsung cool mist humidifier."
3,Easy to clean but not as good as Penguin,I bought the elephant to replace 2 previous Crane Penguin humidifiers. I wanted to try a different animal for my son and it looked like it would be easier to clean. It is in fact easier to clean but it also does not put out as much humidity as the penguin one. We use this daily as we have very very dry air (around 10% humidity) and find that the reservoir lasts almost twice as long as the Penguin used to. We run the Elephant for the same hours and at full blast and we wake up feeling a bit dry still. Next time I'm sticking to the Penguin.
2,It's super cute but not really functional,"We got the green frog and it's really cute. But when my son had a cold, we couldn't get warm air to blow out. Then realized it only sends out cold mist. It's great in that the mist moisturizes the air, but I really wanted warm mist, which is really soothing. We have a humidifier from the 1970's, belonging to my parents, so we dragged that out and man, it just blasts the room with awesome hot mist and in no time he was feeling better. I see on the description that it says ""COOL mist humidifier"" but I had mistaken that all humidifiers gave off warm/hot air. I guess they want it child safe, but really, I""m not going to seat him right next to it. Anyway, if you want Cold mist, this is for you. Otherwise, get something more practical."""
2,Not As Good As the Old Penguin,"We bought a Crane Penguin humidifier 4 years ago and it has worked well. So we decided to buy another one for the extra dry winter days. The new penguin looked the same, but the electrical part (bottom half) of the unit was obviously different. The new penguin's vapor appeared weaker than the old one's, apparently there wasn't a fan to blow out the vapor as in the old one. The new penguin was slightly noisier than the old one, though it's still quiet. There was no comparison in the output: The new penguin took 33 hours to use up a gallon of water, while the old one can do it in 14 hours."
4,"Cute, effective and budget friendly",We purchased this in April 2010 and have used it for every nap and night since bringing it home. We've always used distilled water so no filters or anything. Maintenance is nothing outside the norm...clean with vinegar solution to prevent mold/bacteria. I took one star off because sometimes the motor runs loud...there doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason for it but have found that it quiets down after it has run for awhile. Happy twins without crusty noses and happy mama!
4,too cute,"This is just super cute and will be a great addition to my baby's room once he arrives--for now it's in my room and working just fine right out of the box. Unit ran over night on the lowest setting and provided adequate moisture in a larger bedroom, and there's still half a tank of water left! So far, so good."
2,"Cute, but impossible to clean","I think this humidifier is really cute and works well. However, it is impossible to clean. You can only access the tank from a silver-dollar sized opening, so if any mildew builds up at all, you simply can't get in there to wipe it down and a replacement tank costs just about as much as a new system."
1,Very disappointed... Want a refund,"All this product offers is a cute appearance. It does not produce enough mist, even at the max setting, to counter the driness in my toddler's room. When I observed the mist being produced through the kitty's ears over a week, I couldn't help but to think that a smoker could probably puff out a cigarette smoke bigger than that of this humidifier. Too bad, I can't return the product for a refund because I discard the packaging material."
2,Adorable but poorly made,"I purchased 2 of these humidifiers for my children, to use nightly, to help with the dry Colorado air. Yes, they are cute, but within two weeks, my son's stopped working (no mist was coming out). I tried all of the trouble shooting ideas in the instruction manual and even contacted Crane. I had to exchange it for a new one.Now, three months later, I will have to return both of them. Once again, the mist has stopped coming out in one of them. The other one continues to leak, enough that after running all night, there is a 1/2 inch pool of water on the tray I placed under the unit. Aside from that, the handle broke off one of them while I was cleaning it.I gave it two stars because this ultrasonic system is much quieter than the evaporative humidifiers I've had in the past."
4,Thomas Tank Humdifier cooling mist,"This is a very cute product and sure to be a hit with any Thomas fan. The vapor shoots up out of the steam pipe, the nightlight is nice, and Thomas is adorable. BUT There is a product flaw--the light bulb casing under the water tank comes off and floods the room/table. We had to reglue it once so far--after only five fill ups. Hopefully we'll find a solid fix for it. Otherwise, we'll need to stop using it. As one other person said, electricity and water DO NOT MIX."
4,Great little humidifier!,"The humidifier arrived on the expected delivery date. This little humidifier seems to do a great job although I have only had it for one day. It holds a lot of water, it allows you to determine the amount of mist it puts out, and it is quiet. I wanted the humidifier not only for the cool mist but as a 'white noise' too so it could be noisier for my purpose. There is a green light on the front that tells you when the humidifier is on, and that green light is annoying; I don't like extra light in my bedroom. But for parents this could be used a a nightlight. The machine ran all night and did not come close to using up all the water in the Reservoir (the setting was on medium). The machine is easy to fill with water, and it is easy to see the water level. It is of flimsy construction so we'll see how long it lasts."
2,Not very impressed,"After 2 1/2 years, the humidifier stopped working. From the time it came out of the box, I noticed that it produced less steam than other models I have owned. The fan would start to make a loud humming noise which would require it to be turned off and back on. The penguin head cracked as well."
2,this product is for show only,"Bought this product to add humidity to our sons bedroom. It looks cool, is quiet, shoot out the foggy mist in the air, but it does not do the most important thing that it suppose to....add humidity. We had it running every night throughout the the whole night and it just doesn't work. It works as a cool looking accessory...that's it. If you are looking for humidifier, don't waste your money on this product and buy the real thing. You and your baby/child will be much happier."
2,"Cute, but not worth it","I actually purchased this in 2007 for my personal sinus issues. I used for maybe a year, until I saw how much better my boss's simple generic heated mister worked.The weak fan makes some noise, but the heated misters are absolutely quiet. The cool mist sink rapidly and I find it hard to believe it's moisturizing anything other than your carpet. You have to use distilled water or buy expensive tablets to easy the debris that accumulates in this tank. Speaking of the tank, it's awkward to unscrew the head, refill and reload. I have been much happier with the local drug store's generic hot air humidifiers for roughly $20, or this one I bought for my mother:Vicks 1.5 Gallon Vaporizer with Night-Light.If you need them to be cute for a child, then put stickers on it, I suppose."
5,"quiet, efficient and cute!","This frog humidifier is wonderful. I'm so glad I finally decided to get one after reading reviews on it since last winter. Unlike this picture, the actual product is a true Granny Smith apple green, or some might call it lime green.PROS-quiet-no expensive filter required. (my Holmes humidifier requires a new $13 filter about every 6 weeks)-shuts off automatically when it runs out of water-easy to refil water-simple and easy to use-cute!CONS-tiny green light is on when humidifier is in use and I persoanlly like a very dark bedroom at night. I just tape a dark piece of paper over it and problem solved. But it can also be a night light for a child's room.-must be on a nightstand or some sort of elevated surface. Some people might not have that room to spare.-it may be TOO cute and irresitible for little ones to keep their hands off it at first. But the newness wears off."
5,Happy with Purchase -- Adorable and Useful,"This is the 3rd humidifier I have bought for my 23 month old (the other 2 were returned b/c they leaked alot). This one I am keeping -- it has not leaked; it is extremely cute, and is quiet. I like that it does not have a filter to change (if you have a child w/allergies or need clean air, then I would go w/one that needs a filter, but I just wanted mist and hydration in her nursery). She loves the cow that I bought; it matches her decor, is easy to fill and sits on top of her nightstand. I have a larger commercial grade one for my master bedroom but I didn't feel a small nursery needed a super sized humidifier so I bought this Crane adorable one and we are happy w/the purchase."
4,Cute and efficient,"I use this humidifier at college. We've had it for about a month now and it has been working just fine. The dial at the bottom has a lot of adjustment room, and it's really cheap. Not only that, but it's really cute. The only downfall is that you have to clean it with bleach. Regardless, I highly recommend this product."
4,super cute!,"The Hello Kitty humidifier is super cute and works perfectly! It's nice and quiet and adjusting the humidity level is very easy. I deducted 1 star because you have to be careful not to let the rubberized feet sit too long in one spot, or they may mar the painted finish of whatever it's sitting on. But at least it won't slip from whatever it's sitting on. =)"
4,Very Quiet and Efficient.,"I bought the Penguin humidifier from Target a couple months ago because I kept waking up with a sore throat. This product works well and is very cute. My only complaint is that it does not seem to have automatic turn-off. My problem with that is the machine runs so quietly, that I do not have a heard reminder to turn if off in the mornings, and therefore I forget. However, I still manage to only fill it about once a week, which is great."
5,Love the Product!,"We have had this product for over a month.It works great, is absolutely cute in our little newborns room.I am very pleased with this humidifier in all respects.My only observation, is that it has a light hum when operational, and can trigger off the baby monitor (when on voice activation) mode. Our monitor is however located immediately adjacent to the humidifier"
5,One of the best purchases for a newborn I've made so far,I bought the Thomas the Tank version for my son right after he was born. He is now three months old. I use it every day and it's worked well so far:1) It looks like a toy so it blends in with the rest of his room.2) The mist comes out of the top making the train look more realistic3) It acts as a night light (I recently turned it off because I read that babies don't need night lights)4) It makes nice soothing water gurgling noises which acts as natural white noise.I whole heartedly recommend this.
5,Great product,Bought the Hello Kitty Humidifier for my daughter. It is very quiet and makes nice mist cloud from the ears. And it has a night light built in. It looks great in the dark. My daughter loves it. We later also bought a frog and a panda. Both are good but no night light. Make sure do not turn the setting to the highest--water will set around it if too much mist comes out. I like to set it at about 3/4. The adjustable settings are very good to control the amount of mist. We bought one from Walgreens and there was only two settings of how much mist was generated with an adjustable opening. We had to return that one due to too much mist which made the night stand wet the next morning.We are very happy with this product. Highly recommend it to girls who love Hello Kitty.
3,It's works,"It's noisy, not terribly, but noisy. Especially when compared to the Crane drop-shaped blue/white one. The plastic quality is definitely cheap. It's messy - every time you lift the top to refill, it's dripping with water. When set to very low level, it only makes noise and no humidity. You have to set the knob to at least fifth of the way to actually to get humidity. So why three stars? Because the animal shape looks good in a kids room. My daughter loves the elephant shape and it does the job of a humidifier, with all its flaws. If you dont care about the shape, I would simply get the Crane drop-shaped one, which is the best cool-mist humidifier."
2,Nothing special... we've seen it all before.,"There's plainly just not enough material on this DVD. Yes, the menu is really cool but it is confusing. Since nothing is labeled, you just search around Gorillaz' house and highlight random objects and watch videos. They have the four music videos for ""Clint Eastwood,"" ""19-2000,"" ""Tomorrow Comes Today,"" and ""Rock da' House.""Those videos are all good, but honestly this DVD only gives you abount one hour of veiwing entertainment. The rest is filler of lame skits and the videos before they were filled in with color so they'e just pencil sketches."
3,Where are the Gorillaz?,"Even though this is a rather ingenious music dvd, what I had really wanted to see was the group perform. I saw them on TV recently at the Manchester Symphony Hall and loved the show. That's what prompted me to buy this dvd but, sadly, it is all animation.....not something I really like. Their music, however, is still fantastic, but it is hard to navigate through this creative, cartoon dvd."
2,Virus!!!!!,"The DVD itself is fine although I'm not satisfied watching only a few of their videos. However, this package comes with an extra CD where you can get wallpapers and screensavers. Don't make a mistake by installing this on your PC. My PC caught a virus!!!!!"
3,"Dance 10, Looks 3 - difficult to navigate this DVD !","I love the videos on this DVD. The problem is there are so few of them and it's so hard to navigate; I mean it-this thing is really difficult to get around. If I could figure out how to simply play all the videos back to back, I'd have this thing in my DVD player all the time. But it seems the disc goes back to a main or secondary menu after every video. So you have to babysit the disc; that really takes the fun out of it.If anyone knows how to make this thing just operate on autoplay let me know."
3,"Fahey sharpens skills in ""Virtual""","Jeff Fahey (Darkman III, Lawn Mower Man) has been making movies since 1985. He has put time and effort in his characters, starring in 42 films since 2000. He can be a vicious gunslinger (Silverado) then turn around and be a totally polished gentelman (Outback, later released as Wrangler). This ability to put himself in his character's skin makes him an interesting study. That's why he works so well in ""Virtual Seduction"". He portrays a ruderless man lost in fantasy. He's fueled by love, regrets and heartbreak over the death of his lover. But living in fantasy has it's price. Though not a big-budget film, it's entertaining and Fahey makes us empathize with his character's need to have another chance. Worth a look both to see this actor's skills and view a good sci-fi thriller."
4,Quite a scary album!,"This was the rarest of all the Spiral Vertigo LPs released in the UK. Most people appear to think that it is not a very good album: I disagree. It is a little rough around the edges I admit, but at least there isn't really another album quite like it. The band are a three piece comprising the singer/keyboardist (Harpsichord, Piano, Organ), a bassist, and a drummer. The album is a concept album about the singer's descent into hell due to his soul splitting into three parts. Momentarilly cheesey, an almost Rock-Opera feel to it - but definitely quite a scary album which is its main charm. As far as musicmanship goes, the drummer is excellent, the keyboards are very well played and quite eclectic (definitely a hint of jazz-fusion here), the bass is competant and fills out the sound, and the vocals are ... umm ... aggressive and mean spirited. But I should stress that this album is not everyone's cup of tea: an acquired taste indeed!"
5,This guy is pimp,I like all kinds of music but my favorite band is Nerd. Pharell has amazing vocals and the rythems and beats him chad and shay make are mind blowing.. This guy Peter adams is the white pharell!! He makes his own music and its so diffrent and hot! I actually heard listen harmony and Cementalisque on a honda dvd that i bought off this site called DEFECT and i copyed the music onto my phone.. Two thumbs up to peter adams! Stop reading this and click buy it now!
5,"Skeptical as always, but wow. This anime was great.","I'll make this quick since most reviewers already poured their hearts out for this one. The animation is fantastic, very well done.I was skeptical because of the low price these s.a.v.e versions offer, but that was all put to the side after getting into this one.The story progresses beautifully and leaves you wondering and wanting more. It's well balanced with funny, sad, romantic, and mystery aspects.Unless you're someone who can only watch hardcore action anime, I doubt you'll regret putting this series in your collection. Enjoy!"
1,Poor packaging for the price,"Lets be honest, anybody who buys anime on Amazon has most likley already seen it. Therefor this review is just for the DVD itself rather than a review of the series itself, in which case it would be five stars. I decided to buy this box set for the 20 dollar one because the artwork looked much better and in this anime in particular with its stunning visuals, thats a big deal for me. It came in one of those cheap cardboard cases that funimation uses where the corners start to peel and fray over time. When I opened the plastic singles the little plastic circles that hold the discs in place were broken in both of them. Save yourself some money and buy the 25 dollar version."
5,Key is a master,"If you have seen Clannad, Angel Beats, or any other Key anime this is a must see! This is one of keys earlier works, but is truly a masterpiece. Just on par with Clannad, you will see similarities between the two. It is now right behind Clannad in my favorite dramas. This series will make you love winter, and really think about life. This anime isn't really heard of as much as others, but it is amazing!"
1,"Poor writing, obnoxious characters, and not the ""reality-rooted"" story I expected","My husband and I are big anime fans (my husband has seen dozens of series in their entirety), but this anime was honestly kind of painful to watch. The dialogue is very poorly written/translated, the characters are annoying and constantly argue over stupid things, and the fact that this is a supernatural anime was not at all made clear by any reviews or summaries, so it felt utterly out of place to us with an introduction of pure (annoying) character development. (Not to mention Yuichi is kind of an ass to all of these girls who like him.) Both of us absolutely would not recommend this anime. Bad writing, characters that we didn't care about, and a plot that takes way too long to develop and goes in a completely opposite (and absurd) direction from what the introductory episodes suggest."
2,"Uhh, Distortion is not required...","See, I like Daemon's vocals the way they were on QIT, but the distortion they added is just not neccasary, too bad, could of been a great album.. oh well"
5,Transcendent and Addictive,"This is the most ferociously beautiful record I've heard in years. The first and last songs are unbelievably sweet and spare while many of the songs in the middle are too intense for mainstream radioplay. Each song links together to form a story in sound and words that will take you on an emotional rollercoaster from anger to longing. Because this record is so genuine and original, you will have to take a risk in buying this and listening to it. The songs frequently employ unusual structures and alternate guitar tunings. For me, it was like discovering music for the first time all over again. This is brave music for people who want music that will unhinge them."
1,Review of Gilad Bodies in Motion VI (2009),"The title says that this is a 2009 DVD, but it is not. It is from 1991 and I am very disappointed."
1,"If you are looking for PRAXIS test prep, you should probably look elsewhere","If you are looking for PRAXIS test prep, you should probably look elsewhere, as the content in this Jack Rudman book is, by and large, unrelated to the actual exam."
5,"Enlightening,impowering endurance manual...","This perspective-changing booklet on perservering through ""trying""trials,does a peerless job of identifying the""flaws""inherent in the human psyche which actually contribute to the""introduction""of tough times,as well as offering some very valid/effective techniques in making tough times tolerable...This is definitely a book which EVERYone going through stressful""stretches""in life should contemplate on,at length,as the advice offered here in overcoming despair and discouragement is nothing short of PROFOUND!! Not only adroit at helping one""manage""tough circumstances,it also reveals how to OBVIATE such circumstances altogether!! SUPERB reading without question!!"
3,good buy,"its good , the nylon coating is good for the rough usage as well.definitely a good buy who dont take care about their products.Carpenters here is the product you should go for."
2,Inaccurate description,"The product description says speakers, which implies a pair. I was disappointed to receive only one. Still fairly priced but creates confusion and delays."
2,Not Very Comfortable....,"I found these headphones to be very uncomfortable, not to mention the clips catch in your hair, if you have long hair. They also do not sound anywhere near as good as the Panasonic RP-HG10...which I highly recommend."
4,another entertaining tale from Tom Deitz,"Wordwright is the final of the trilogy of Ronny Dillon. Enough twist and turns to keep me interested. While at the same time, since not having read the previous two books gives good character descriptions and believable personalities that this is not a disadvantage....more an incentive to find copies of earlier books.Novel with great characters, plenty of pace and the ability to not want to put it down. Well worth the read, as Ron deals with his past, and the potential of the future."
4,Once dead - now resurrected,"One of my favorite albums by the band - fighting for the high position with their first release. Both Cds were great, this one just seems to have a different vibe and groove for me, so I always really enjoyed it. Can't say the remastering has made any HUGE noticeable difference, but just knowing it has been tinkered with and now re-released, makes it a worthy purchase."
5,"Timeless humor, laugh-out-loud funny!!!","I first discovered Jim Unger's ""Herman"" when I was a teenager. For the next several years I bought every Herman Treasury Collection as they became available. I was amazed that any comic could be so consistently (laugh-out-loud type) funny. I'm now 41 and I just rediscovered my Herman collection during a move. The humor of Herman is definitely ageless because I still laugh every time I pick up one of the collections.I just purchased the Herman Classics Collections vol. 1, 2 and 3 (beautiful books, great print quality) and I hope that their are more on the way.My recommendation to the publisher - publish a hardbound master collection at some point, something that would look nice on my bookshelves and something that I can pass along to my grandkids (""Gee, grandpa had a sense of humor!"")."
2,Poetry?,"This is another book where the Kindle edition does not format the text as lines of poetry, but just runs everything together. The text is there, but hard to appreciate. The Table of Contents is linked to the items."
5,Summer Reading,Arrived on time. Quality was as expected for the price...good.Good author for summer reading.
5,Brutal.,"That's the only word I can think of to describe this release. F-Minus and Steve Albini took the raw promise of the band's first two albums and created an album which has a place in my top five for 2003. Just try to listen to ""Wake Up Screaming"" and not want to either run around the room or break something. I swear to god it's impossible.When you get the money, pick this up!"
2,Good when it works,"We are on our second camera. The first one we bought right before we left on vacation. The camera broke at Grand Canyon National Park. Screen just went blank. Luckily we were traveling with friends who took pictures for us. We returned the camera at the end of our vacation and were given a new camera. One year later, with many good pictures during that year, we are again on vacation. Great Smokey Mountain national park this time. And the same thing happens. This time no friends to take pictures. Still going through the process of getting it fixed. This camera is not dependable. I would not recommend it!"
5,Great camera,"I have had several of the Exilim cameras and this latest version is a lower resolution but has some advantages that outweigh the lower res. It has no lens that protrudes from the body of the camera which makes it a perfect camera to always have around. As a professional Photographer I'm always aware that the occasional shots I see when I don't have my equipment with me are missed, ever since I've carried an Exilim with me that's less likely to happen. No it's not as good as my more expensive gear, but it's much more portable and always with me."
3,Heavy,A little thick and heavy for a pocket digicam but the 7x zoom was nice though I needed to brace against something to keep pics from blurring. Ultimatly the newest quicktime video format it used just wasn't compatable with windows 98 so I had to return it.
3,Camera came with a problem,The camera is not working from the moment i open the box.Appear a problems that sai (camera stabilizer is not available).so i had to send the camera to a tecnical support
1,I really liked this camera - but mine died too,"I've treated this Camera with kit gloves ever since I bought. It has NEVER been dropped. I've had it for a year or so, but I just got bit like ALL the others. Camera Stabilizer not availbe - and powers down. Evidently, CASIO has posted a S/W update for the camera V1.03 that will at least let the camera function when the Stabilizer malfunctions. I may try and update it, but I have half a mind to throw it away and buy a REAL Camera like Nikkon or Cannon.BTW, this was the 2nd CASIO camera I purchased. The first, I purchased right before a trip to Disney World. As soon as I arrived, the screen went all White/Black wonky. When we returned home, I returned it to the retailer and bought this on.CASIO is a HORRIBLE brand. Never buy one of their cameras.Don't waste your money. I rate this 0 stars. Amazon, you need to allow people to rate things 0 stars."
1,Mine died just like the others,"Same problem. Great pictures and features, but it up and died in Bangkok for no good reason. Too many of us have had the same problem. Also the case Amazon suggests doesn't fit."
1,JUNK,Had for a little over a month. Camera broke on trip to Costa Rica. Not at all durable. Met someone with same broken camera. Buy at your own risk.
1,A Great Deal ??????????,"Wow, 7x optical zoom, 7MP, on sale for $169 on a Boxing day deal down from $349 regular. What's not to love, right?Well, after about 3 days of regular use, I was presented with the 'Stabilizer Not Available' message and it would not even turn on. I would recommend NO ONE EVER BUY A CASIO CAMERA. Based on the reviews on amazon and elsewhere, I don't know how a company like CASIO can get away with releasing a paperweight and calling it a camera. I wouldn't by another one if it were 20 cents. I hope people from Casio read this review and are ashamed to show their faces in public. I'm giving this one star because it is the lowest rating you are allowed and still have a review.Buy one if you want a new hockey puck and have $200 lying around."
5,bueno,"al ser usado esta bien den tro de lo nor mal, sin ambargo no tiene refacciones, por ser tan desactualizado"
1,Avoid this camera,"I bought two of these cameras for my daughters less than a month ago. Now, after less than 100 pictures taken on each, BOTH camaeras exhibit the ""camera stabilizer not available"" error. So far, Casio customer support has been less than stellar. I am returning both cameras for ""repair"". Take my advice and look elsewhere. This camera has a major flaw, as evidenced by all the similar problems in these Amazon reviews."
3,"Poor Video Quality, esp. under low light. Picture Okay","I didn't get to use the cameral fully because I bought a refurbished one. The scroll buttons didn't work. I took some pictures and videos with the limited feature. Picture quality was okay. Color didn't seem that vibrant. Not sure if I could adjust the setting. I couldn't because the scroll buttons weren't working. Video was horrible when taken under low like. Very grainy. I had to send it back, but lost $5.50 for shipping cost. Ended up buying a Canon Powershot SX110. Should have better video under low light. Still waiting for it to be shipped."
4,tonka trucks for toddler,"Trucks were a little bit smaller than I pictured, but it didn't seem to matter to my nephew. He enjoyed playing with them on the floor carpet designed as a mini city."
4,Waiting for Sarah Bruce McBay and James Heneghan,"The story begins with a horrific accident.Mike,his two parents, and his sister,Becky, were on their way to a fun family vacation.A drunk driver in a semi truck hit the family's car.All passengers and the driver except Mike died.Mike woke up in a hospital.He was hit with the bad news.Not only was his family dead but his legs were amputated.Mike had to stay in the hospital so a physical thearipist could begin to teach him how life will be like without legs.Read this exciting story to hear how Mike's life changed.I recommend this story to my friends because it changed the way I think about life and it will change them.They will enjoy reading it."
3,Skimmers,"In 1939 in Amsterdam, two young men (Anton and David) train as rowers, led by a mysterious doctor, who dangles the possibility of the Olympics before them. Blending into the time five years later, Anton sees his city barren and reminisces about the golden time during his obsession with rowing, with the physicality of action, with his odd relationship with David and the doctor. For Anton, his entire world revolved around the water and what he was doing with David because of his lackluster family and world. This was his one time to dazzle, and it didn't last. This novella is an eloquent trip down one man's memory lane."
4,Great Compilation,"Yolandita at her best. Great Colelction of her best songs. Some here cannot be found elsewhere, nowadays."
1,"Below disappointing, bordering on offensive","Filled with stereotypes, amateurish writing, and hamfisted plotting, this one is like a bad joke. For a guy who studied at Yale, Ethan doesn't seem to know much about English (Yeats--a 19th c poet???), or parenting (incident with his son) or being interesting on any level. I rarely take the time to post a negative review but this one bugged me. Sorry."
1,Very upsetting,Please don't read Firebird if you are very sensitive and will be upset by reading about terrible things happening to an infant.
3,"Slow, sappy, then slow","After all the good reviews I read about this book I thought for sure it was going to be great. The start of the book was slow, the middle made you want to cry, it was sad and cruel and then you get to the end and the story line goes from a fast pace to slow and hard to follow. I like books where there is a hero and I couldn't find one in this book, the hero I guess could have been a 9 yr. old little girl but I will let that one for you to decide. If you like tear-jerkers you will love this book."
2,Mislead,"Having been a LaVyrle Spencer fan for years I bought this book because of her comments on the cover. How misleading. Although I know a lot of work went into this book there were some things that just weren't there. After reading it, I went back over the first 50 or so pages looking for a physical description of the hero - a part of Romance Fiction that I see as a great necessity. I found that he was tall, had large hands, a dark brow, was well-educated - but there were none of the stereo-typical ""brown eyes, broad shoulders, pouting lips"" that most women read Romance for. I also found the dialog to be lacking in believability. Dialog is difficult for some writers to do convincingly and perhaps Ms. Graham could use some practice in this area.I do congratulate Ms. Graham on having accomplished writing and publishing a novel. I will look for other titles from her in the future in the hopes that with more practice she will be able to hone her craft."
1,Spoiled by...,"Following ""San Francisco Chronicle"" Review, (8/16/98) I was about to order this book. It sounded like a good, light read with interesting characters. BUT...the Amazon Review ruined the reading by telling the ending. Kirkus Review's first line spoils the chance of enjoying this book as a fresh reader. Thanks!"
3,Very moving,"Graham writes well and this is a very sad but intensely moving novel. I thought Ethan Brown was a rather cold, emotionally barren character, who wasn't really worthy of the love of two good women. The thing that annoyed me about the novel, though, is that although Ethan does eventually fall in love with Katie Anne...it's not really her, he loves but her as Annette. The rather selfish, fickle Katie Anne returns from her near death experience a changed woman - she basically acquires all Annette's characteristics; cultured, a loving mother and selfless: I found this transformation to be totally implausible."
4,Uplifting!,"To all those who reviewed this book and gave it a (1) star, I just want to say--you people take life too seriously! I don't usually read ""romance"" novels because they are generally all alike, but this was more than ""dribble"", as one reader put it. It was an inspiration for the soul that love can survive and grow. Even death cannot snuff it out. Who's to say what transcends after we are gone. All I know is, this book made me feel a LOT of different emotions and it made me look at my life and my love for the people in my life and not to take it all for granted or waste it. Maybe those (1) star readers need to re-read it with a more open mind--and heart."
5,Totally engrossing,"Normally I will not buy a book by an author that is unknown to me, but something about this book reached out and grabbed me. When I received it in the mail, I almost sent it back and then I decided I'd give it a try. Once I started this book, nothing could make me put it down. I cried like I had lost a close relative, but when it was finished I felt like there was closure and redemption. I have read thousands of book over the years and no other book has touched me as this book did. I walked around in a daze for hours after reading it, because it was so powerful. I shared it with friends and they all agreed it was the best book that they had ever read. I am anxiously awaiting her next book."
5,What a book! Have the movie rights been sold?,We are all casting the movie on our office coffee breaks! Please tell us we have a chance of seeing this book made into a first-class movie. I voted for Kevin Costner!
2,Don't waste your time on this one!,A fragmented story line involving unbelieveable characters with minimal (if any) chemistry---it just doesn't work as a romance novel!
1,Don't waste your time!,"This predictable and sappily written book was a total waste of time. Janice Graham tries to imitate the writing style found in both ""The Horse Whisperer"" and ""Bridges of Madison County"" and does not do either justice. The continuous dream sequences are out of place and the phony feelings portrayed make this one of the most ridculous stories written."
1,Weak Characters and too Predictable,I tried very hard to get into this book but I just wasn't able to. The Main reason for this is the characters which are written so weak that I just didn't care about any of them.The story centers on a love triangle that is too predictable and belongs on Daytime Television. I do give the author credit for the unusual and unexpected plot twist in the middle but it arrives too late and unfortunetely is not enough to save the entire story.
4,rock pioneer,"This cd has all the charted top 40ty hits unfortunatly it suffers from sloppy mastering the beguing of ""Sway With Me"" is missing as is the ending of ""Rip It Up"" but this version is the one heard in the movie ""Don't Knock The Rock"" has the ending mising too it might have been released that way in England the sound is excelent and I would recomend this collection I would recomend getting this along with the movies ""Rock Around The Clock"" and ""Don't Knock The Rock "" also the earlier hits collection 51-54 and a live album ""still Rocking Around The Clock"" an BMG it is a reisue of a concert from 1971? that was originaly released on the Kamma Sutra label although they have the tracks out of order Bill was one of the true pioneers of rock and roll and helped get it to a wider audience and in the process helped the black artist get heard and recognized"
5,"aaaThe antithesis to american fundamentalist 'christianity"".","Dietrich Bonhoeffer's demanding book is mandantory for any professing christian{i think he would sqirm at that term.}The idea that one would be ""saved"" simply by saying so is repugnant to one who saw what was coming.Read some popular ""religious"" christian literature,then read Bonhoeffer.You will realize that he is speaking of a completely different faith,never mind religion.No fuzzy new-age garbage here.I cannot imagine an adult who would not be troubled by Bonhoeffer,for there seems to be no distinction between what he said, and what he did.Would that be true for all."
3,Somewhat hard to get into.,"I tried to read this book but had a hard time getting into it. I think its probably just me, but I am definately going to give it another go before saying its a bad book."
5,Bonhoeffer tells it like it is.,"In a time when we are constantly bombarded with the idea that being a Christian means telling others how to live and living warrior ideals for our beliefs, a true hero of the Christian faith shows us that it's not that easy. Living for Christ means really loving our neighbors, and we don't get to say that those bad folks aren't our neighbors.This book is not easy to read. It's difficult, not just to take in (although you may sometimes need to read a paragraph two or three times to really comprehend its meaning), but to accept, because it's hard to imagine who can really live up to what Bonhoeffer shows us Christ is really asking of us. Nevertheless, I recommend making the effort in both areas."
4,Incomplete,"What I have read so far is very good. It is not a criticism of the book, but just they way I read books. Am looking forward to completion of my reading"
3,Wears on You Over Time,"I used to think this was one of the most important spiritual books ever written. Over time, though, I have come to the realization that Bonhoeffer's sacrifice -- his failed attempt to assassinate Hitler -- was in itself an attempt at ""cheap grace"", the very thing he decried. He isolated himself from his community, and lacked the courage and fortitude to speak out when he had the opportunity. The result of his failed plot may have contributed to the deaths of millions of people, because without his plot it now seems likely that Hitler's generals would have overthrown him as much as two years before the end of the war.Bonhoeffer has become somewhat of a cultic figure in recent years, and that's unfortunate. He was an important but flawed thinker who could never escape the Protestant individualism of his religious tradition. This book is probably the best example of his work, though Bethge's picture book on his life (""Steps"") contains enough for most people."
1,1 Star for Dietrich Bonhoeffer,The book covers leave something to be desired. He was 1 man trying to save many; I don't appreciate Christian denominations trying to claim him for their agenda. Where were you when a nation of God-fearing Christians supported Hitler?
5,The first 5 chapters are worth the priced of the book alone.,"Every Christian should read this challenging thinker. Here was a guy who was following nothing but the Savior. Wonderfully insightful and leaves us no place to hide in our tepid half baked ""churchianity"". We must answer the call of Christ in our lives; there really is nothing else for us in this world. I read Eric Mataxes biography of Bonhoeffer first. It sets and excellent background to what Bonhoeffer says in the Cost of Discipleship. I would recommend reading them together."
5,Great Classic,This book is one for the ages. A great work that will inspire your faith and heklp enhance and develop your walk with Christ. A great spiritual aide.
5,true disciple,"as the way Germany went so goes Americathis book is for someone who is looking to understand suffering, sacrifice, what is wrong with the church in America, and the truth about discipleship"
4,"Chellenging, difficult, possibly life changing","A very difficult book to read and comprehend. The points Bonhoeffer makes, if followed, are potentially life changing. One issue for me - reconciling some of what Bonhoeffer says vs what he did during world war II. Is it do as I say, or do as I do, or am I just missing something?"
5,Welcome Awe Into Your World,"Someone very dear recommended this book, and though I am not into self-help books, I tried it. Didn't get very far, though, until I found the audio. Which I have now listened to 3 times. First time through I thought: this guy is kinda goofy. But there was enough there, that I decided to listen again and really started getting the picture. The author carefully blends a focus on spirituality and thought provoking methods of handling the curves we find in our lives. I will go back to the book itself next, then look for other works by this author. And will be practicing the art of Real Magic!"
5,I'm so glad I found this book!,"As Dr. Dyer says, ""when the time is right the teacher will appear."" I was so ready for this book, that when I finished it I flipped back to page 1 and started again. I've dog-eared pages that have specific meaning to me so I can go back and re-read them again and again. I realize this will be an on-going process for the rest of my life. ""Satori"" doesn't happen all the time, some things you just have to keep thinking about and trying to incorporate into your life. I love the message that ""everything you need - you already have inside of you."" I never realized that before. I always thought that some things you have and some things you just don't. Now I know that I can achieve anything. I just have to tap into it and work toward it."
5,Please read this book!!!!!,"As someone who has perhaps been a little cynical in the past, I can honestly say that this book is changing me - the way I think, the way I act - and I'm sure for the better. My partner has noticed a new me in just 10 days! This book shows that you can change the way you think and change your life. It talks about how to create miracles, and I've already seen a few minor miracles in my own life in just 10 days.I won't try to summarise the whole book since there are too many important points. However, please just buy the book, read it with an open mind, follow what it says, and you will be a very happier, more joyous, more prosperous person. Mr Dyer, you are blessed! and, as you yourself would say, we can all be blessed too.PS I have a very scientific upbringing and my colleagues would not believe I've written such a review - but I stick with it!"
4,real magic,i read this book and got a lot outof it. wayne dyer is the person who helped me understand where my source comes from.
3,Positive and Insightful,"Easy to read, and very positive outlook on life. If you are looking to read something to help change your thinking then this is a good place to start."
3,Nothing Original In This Book,"Dyer has updated the thoughts of Emerson, Holmes, and Eddy, etc. and produced a book that is useful, and written in readable language. It was an interesting read.But there is not a single original thought in this book. Now, there is nothing wrong with that in and of itself. If Dyer had said, 'Hey, I learned from the New Thought movement and applied it to my life, and here is what I learned,' that would be great. But instead he leads you to believe that he invented all of this stuff, that he, through the force of his gigantic mind, created a whole new philosophy. He didn't. Read Ralph Waldo Emerson and you will see. Go to a Church of Religious Science, and you will find a church based on this thinking, founded when Dyer was in diapers, or earlier.Dyer's refusal to give anyone else credit took away from my enjoyment of this book. I have already seen these concepts in action; good concepts. Great concepts. Just don't tell me you invented them."
3,Kindof magical,"There are two types of people in the world: Those who get the Wayne Dyer thing -and- those who don't. I personally don't. I like him because he has a shaved head like me. Otherwise, I don't care much for his books. This was a recommendation from Larry Winget, so I had to give it a shot. He seems like a very nice guy when you see him all over PBS though. Bottom line: its very fluffy."
5,A Book Among Books-That Brings Light to the World!,"Hello,I must say this is one of the most profound books I have ever come across. I happen to be a Hindu and a student of both Western and Indian Philosophy but I have seldom come across a book so deceptively simple yet so breathtaking in its insights. I can honestly say that this book has proved to be an invaluabe aid to my life's problems of many many years. After many years of searching answers in the pages of Russell, Foucalt, Santayana, Plato or even in my earlier ""desi"" favourite Deepak Chopra, I owe Dr. Dyer my profoundest gratitude to bring this book to my life. Dr. Dyer, You are an angel, may you come back again and again to spread light, joy and peace in this world. This man, Dr. Dyer, are one of the true ""peacemakers"" and truly he shall be called a ""child of God"". Om Shanti Shanti Shanti."
4,Very positive and worthwhile reading.,"Dr. Dyer's ""Real Magic"" is a great source of inspiration and information on how we each create our own realities and are responsible for our own lives. I would like to add that there are other works, most notably the Seth books (Seth Speaks, and The Nature of Personal Reality), which describe in much more detail exactly how physical reality is formed and our part in forming it. Other excellent books include Lynda Dahl's ""Beyond the Winning Streak"" and ""Ten Thousand Whispers"", Pamela Oslie's ""Make Your Dreams Come True"", and Christopher Stone's ""Re-creating Your Self"". I believe that once you start reading the Seth books, though, you won't look back. By the way, Seth Network International has a website."
5,real magic has brought mircles in my life,real magic is too good book for one's life transformation.I too do not understand how you shoulkd have desire but no attchment to the result for the thing you manifest.
1,A pathetic tale about a manipulative girl,"I wanted to read this book since I've enjoyed such memoirs as Dry, Wasted, and Drinking: A love story. But page after page about a self-absorbed brat with a pathetically devoted and brainwashed father enabling her 14-year suicide was disgusting, frustrating, and depressing.I understand that anorexia is not a choice, but I don't think this book is about an anoretic. It's more about someone with borderline personality disorder and how effectively that can wear on people's -- even professionals' -- patience. And how effectively it can manipulate the willing, even in getting them to publish sappy memoirs posthumously. I agree that the book brings up ethical questions about psychiatric care that need to be addressed. It made me wish someone would just take her to a shelter and put her to sleep so I wouldn't have to read any more of her whining, false-memory-spewing nonsense."
4,"Great story, this guy sure could write","I loved this little story, every line was so beautifully crafted, it was a pleasure just to look at it from a technical point of view, I will read it again and pass it on."
4,Truman Capote's Christmas Memory,"The remembered Christmas was both precious and sad, and so unlike our very commercial Christmases that Capote's account is almost difficult to understand. Precious because his family knew how to treasure each other and their individual foibles, although none of them could afford the sort of Christmas gifts we think necessary to give. Sad because the most loving aunties were too old to keep on living and being family for this excellent author. Still, a wonderful little book to give as a gift to oneself or to a treasured friend or relative: it makes Christmas more special than our style of celebration can provide."
4,A good story,"Capote did a nice job on this book which was later turned into movi, twice. It is a true story of Truman when he was a little boy and his relationship with an old aunt. The highlight of the story is the making of the Christmas cakes. ""It's Christmas cake weatha"" calls out the aunt to Truman as they go out picking up walnuts and then all of the other ingredients that are needed for all of the cakes. She has saved all year in order to get the few dollars that she needs to buy everything. She gives them all away every year to people. lovely story"
5,A beautifully-written book!,"I loved this book about a young boy, his kind old cousin, and other relatives that just didn't understand her eccentric ways! Capote gave us a deep look into the loving and giving heart of his elderly cousin--a heart that few people ever took the time to really see. A beautiful story and a memoir of Capote's early life in rural Alabama. I will read this book again and again and give it as gifts to my friends. For adults and children. Great read!!!Denise GeorgeAuthor of: Johnny Cornflakes:A Story About Loving the Unloved"
5,Capote's Christmas Gem,"Truman Capote was arguably one of America's best writers of this century. Once quoted as saying that writing for a living is like being a professional ""pool shark,"" he was weird, witty, and wonderful. But this warm simple story stands in sharp contrast to his public persona. Try reading it aloud with a dry eye. A perfect addition to any family's Christmas tradition"
3,My Thoughts on a Christmas Memory,"The book, A Christmas Memory, by Truman Capote, is an exremely emotional book. It is full of great characters and sad situations. I put myself into Buddy's shoes and imagine if I was him and being sent away to military school, how would I feel? I would feel like I was not wanted and I was being sent away. Sent away from the people you love and make you who you are. This part of the book made me think about how difficult it would be to leave everything you love. Buddy and Sook spent all their time together and suddenly Buddy was being sent away and Sook felt like she was losing him like her old friend who died also named Buddy. This book is a very strong and moving novel that I would recomend to anyone."
3,A quick but interesting read,The only fault with this little book is just that. It's so short and suddenly...it's over. Fun to read but somewhat of a disappointment considering the other works of the author
3,A Christmas Memory,"Truman Capote's picture book A Cristmas Memory was a great book because it taught you that life isnt always good. They were sending Buddy away to a military school and they were getting very emotional because they knew they wrent going to see each other ever again It made me feel mad because the ""higher power"" didn't care about their feelings about each other I felt bad because it would be horrible if you lost your best friend to a military camp. This book makes you cherish the things that you have in life."
5,A Christmas Memory,"The novel A Christmas Memory written by Truman Capote will give you strong emotions. One thing that I acted strongly about was when his cousin was going to send Buddy off to military school. It made me angry at his cousin when she thought that was what was best for a seven year old child. Sook, his friend started to sob, its just not right. A Christmas memory will make you feel sad and angry, but I enjoyed the book."
2,A Christmas Memory,A Christmas memory by Truman Capote makes you have many diffrent strong fellings. Buddy's aunt choose to send him to a military school. He didn't want to go but she thought it was best for him. In the book Buddy had a friend. She was his cusin. They had been together every since Buddy was little. This was their last Christmas together. He didn't want to leave his friend but he had to. When he leaft that was the hardest part in the book. A Christmas Memory can certainly make you be sad and mad at diffrent times. Your emotions change real fast.
3,A Note about the Edition,"A CHRISTMAS MEMORY is Capote's autobiographical short story about an orphaned, 7-year-old boy named Buddy; his fun, elderly woman cousin; their dog Queenie; and their disapproving relatives. It's mischievous, inspirational, and somewhat sad, with a real sense of the 1930s setting and a peek into what likely stirred the writer in Capote.NOTE: I inadvertently ordered this ""Tale Blazers"" edition. It is intended for instructional use and includes the text of the short story plus questions and quizzes about vocabulary and reading comprehension. If you're only interested in the text, you can find the story online. But for a more pleasurable reading experience, I recommend theillustrated edition."
4,Terrific story,"I ordered this book after first reading the story in a collection of Capote stories from the library. I knew I wanted to own it and share it. I ordered one for myself and one for a friend who loves Christmas so she could enjoy it and share it with her friends and family. I haven't listened to the CD that comes with it, but that was a nice surprise. The only thing I didn't like about the book are the illustrations. After having read more about Capote and seeing photos of him and his aunt, the pictures just didn't seem to match. They seemed too charming to me, not conveying the reality. For someone without a preconcieved idea of what the characters should look like it won't matter and this book is actually geared towards children, whereas the original story was not. I enjoyed my initial reading the most being able to create the scenes in my mind with his beautiful descriptions and my own experience with elderly relatives. I plan to search for version with no illustrations."
4,Very Nice Book,I thought this was a very good book. I read it in one night. It was written really well. I enjoyed it.
4,My review,The book A Christmas Memory is sure to make you show your emotions and feelings for a young boy named Buddy. Buddy was torn apart from the family that he had grown up with ever since he was young. It was sad that Buddy had to be out on his own at such an early age. I was amazed that Sook had the courage and bravery to take Buddy to the bus stop when he had to leave. Every year while Buddy was in military school Sook would send Buddy the best fruitcake of the bunch. Unless you are ready to feel some strong emotions I would advise you not to read A Christmas Memory.
4,My Review,"A Christmas Memory by Truman Capote was a captivative and moving story. It shows the powerful bond of a friendship, no matter the age. Sook was like Buddy's grandmother, however, they acted the same age. It was heart warming, even though I also felt outraged at Jenny for being so heartless. A Christmas Memory is a great book to read if you like touching stories"
5,a wonderful story to read aloud with family,"This year our Winter Party for Book group chose to read this book aloud. As we sat around the table, we took turns reading the story. Truman Capote's writing is so eloquent, the changing of reader's did not influence the story. I was captivated by his experiences. I am waiting for a ""30 fruit cake day""."
5,SHORT AND VERY SWEET!,I REALLY LOVED THE MOVIE AND ALSO ENJOYED THE BOOK. I WAS MORE THAN SURPRISED ABOUT THE AUTHOR BEING TRUMAN CAPOTE.
3,Just Amazing,"My original title to this review was The 3 Stooges Plan a Hit. I don't think the site liked my flippant attitude because it was never put on line. However, the villain in this piece has to be one of the most inept plotters I have ever read about. The only reason he stayed out of jail as long as he did was because he was surrounded by people who were incredibly gullible and naturally larcenous and who were only too willing to believe his tall tales or go along with his schemes. The counterfeit scheme alone will leave you amazed.Read this one for the black humor it provides if you must read it at all.The boardwalk site that was the background for this story is also back in the news. Progress threatens to bulldoze it. Ah, well, another t-shirt place more or less."
4,Knowing one of the victims,Knowing Kevin(Mark) Ramsey made reading this book very difficult. I thought it was a great book even if I did through it across the room a few times. I like true crime books and this is one of the best I've read.
4,THIS IS ALMOST SURREAL!,"CAN'T BELIEVE THIS COULD ALL ACTUALLY HAPPEN, ESPECIALLY W/SO MANY PEOPLE WHO WERE AWARE, YET SAID NOTHING TO POLICE. LOVE TO SEE THIS MADE INTO A MOVIE! AND YES, IT IS AS SENSATIONAL AS THE TITLE WOULD HAVE YOU TO BELIEVE. IT IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF HOW 2 PERSONALITIES COME TOGETHER AND CAUSE HAVOC FOR ALL AROUND THEM.DEIRDRE HUNT IS NOT A VICTIM HERE, NOR WAS SHE MANIPULATED BY KOSTA. AFTER ALL, SHE FELT FREE TO SLEEP W/WHOMEVER, IN SPITE OF KOSTA'S OBJECTIONS. SHE HAD FREE WILL, AND EVEN ENCOURAGED THE DEMON GROWING INSIDE OF KOSTA. IT WAS ALL ABOUT GREED!!!IRONICALLY, MY HUSBAND LOOKS ENOUGH LIKE KOSTA TO BE HIS BROTHER, AND HE IS GREEK AS WELL. END OF SIMULARITIES. GREEK MEN DON'T DIVORCE THEIR WIVES; AND THEY SURE DON'T HAVE THEM KILLED EITHER. ARRANGED MARRIAGES WERE COMMON, & STILL PROBABLY ARE, ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE ARE FINANCIAL ASSETS TO CONSIDER. I CAN'T REALLY GRASP WHAT KOSTA HAD TO OFFER HERE...OTHER THAN LISA GENIUNELY LOVED HIM.THIS A GOOD BOOK!"
2,boring,If you love a good crime book don't by this one. The information in it tells you very little. All you learn is that Kosta Fotopoulos is a very evil person who wants to own everything & everyone.
2,The usual Magic book,"This book contains most of the classic tricks that are in most books, although some stand out better than the others. It contains a fantastic introduction telling all the palming techneques, patter, and the atmosphere to put around a preformance. Also suggests what should be worn for boys and girls, which is unique for a book in this day in age."
4,"revenge, rivalry, and settling the score","One of L. Ron Hubbard's best pulp fiction works. A suspenseful and fascinating tale of two bitter rivals Paco and Lars. The story begins with a chance meeting between the two men in Rio de Janeiro. Surprise quickly gives way to hate as Lars observes Paco standing against a wall in the busy Brazilian street. Lars clutches the butt of his .38 inside his shirt as he remembers how Paco, the con man, was solely responsible for his incarceration at the penal colony in French Guiana. Recently escaped, Lars delights in the pleasure of revenge, but he knows that any action from him will bring investigation from the police. Through a series of events, both men find themselves working on the same ship and engage in their final confrontation on the high seas. Hubbard's use of vivid imagery and character development remind me of a good Graham Greene novel."
3,Do-It-Yourself Programming not included,The product was new and looked as described. The product did not include the said do-it-yourself though and I could not use it.
1,Little People chair is more like it....,"If your teen is under 5' tall and 100 lbs, then you may find this chair desireable. I spent alot of money for a kiddie chair; I found a better and cheaper chair at WalMart. I do NOT recommend this item; the fabric is shoddy and the frame is extremely small. Plus, it is difficult to adjust."
2,Professors--do us a favor....,"Please, never assign this book to a student again. Using sources over a decade old is frowned upon in every other discipline; surely, text about using internet as a source for journalists, is even more outmoded as technology is changing faster than research can keep up with.Pros for the book--it's well written, well constructed, and gets information across with ease even if you are not the most tech-savvy writer.Cons--Again, it is completely outdated. The concepts are fine and good, but all the examples are shown (I'm fairly sure) in DOS.Remember: College students today have never lived in a world that wasn't wired.Instead of this text I would HIGHLY recommend Journalism Next: A Practical Guide to Digital Reporting and Publishing by Mark Briggs. Published in 2009, Briggs covers a breadth of information for journalists and a good guide to the basics of web 2.0.Journalism Next: A Practical Guide to Digital Reporting and Publishing"
5,More old age BS from Eric,"Searching for knowledge and acting prideful as if knowledge was really stacking up--that's the old age--people not in tune listening to people not in tune for their knowledge based on reason and rational.NOW the old age gurus have finally discovered something worth listening to--they don't really know anything and never did using logical, rational observations. They say intuition is the only way to truth or real knowledge.The leaders have changed and the followers still follow the old proven to be wrong advice.Relax Eric, relax your poor overworked mind and let the real knowledge make itself known to you.History is falling away like a bad dream--Goodbye great thinkers--hello great Lovers."
4,A fascinating look at the group,"Writing in a concise and descriptive style, Mike Black analyses the rise of this stylish group, looking at their lives in the tiny Welsh village of Cwamaman, and looking at what led to them becoming one of Britain's top rock groups. Looking at both their albums track by track and quoting press reviews, with quotes and anecdotes from the group and tehir associates throughout, this book is lively and informative. A good buy for Phonics fans."
4,Ball which makes exercising a bit of fun!,"Bought one ball for myself - ended up liking it so much that I bought 5 more for my extended family (ages 13 - 65). Some of us are using it for fitness and core conditioning. Others find that it makes a great ""chair"" to wiggle around on/balance on in front of the home computer. My senior age mother loves that fact that she can sit down and get up off from the ball easily - also finds it handy to stretch out hip joints/legs while doing partially seated lunges, etc. After two months since purchase, we're finding the ball seems to be holding up very well under moderate daily use - also retains air pressure quite well. Need to be a little careful rolling around on the ball if wearing clothes with zippers and metal snaps as these might ""scuff"" into ball surface. Otherwise, a great product!"
3,"Nice ball, but came with a slow leak","I got this to use as a birth ball. My husband pumped it up the first time and noticed the next time I went to use it that it had a slow leak. This is a great birth ball - sturdy and comfortable, but if I was planning to buy it for frequent, long-term use, I would not be happy. Using it as an exercise tool would probably require air added daily, which is a hassle."
4,Shuffle off to Buffalo...,"I've owned the iPod Shuffle for about a year, and find it's the best model for people who want to use their iPods while they jog or work out. It has enough memory (even at the low 1/2 gig end) to store a days worth of music, and can either play songs in order or do the whole shuffle random thing. Controls are very intuitive, and it's easy to operate. This book is great for people who need instructions. The actual manual that comes with the Shuffle is short and not too in-depth, and this book is a good replacement for new Shuffle users who are unfamiliar with the product. But people looking for some ""Shuffle secrets"" like how to jump to the beginning or end of a playlist by a couple of button moves won't find these hacks here. That's my only gripe. The book is cheap, cute, but really doesn't go in to the secret world of all the little tricks this thing can do. You'll have to search the Web for that part."
5,Better than anticipated,"I purchased this product for my son who is mentally and physically impaired. And let me tell you this projector is just wonderful for him. We looked at other projectors but they were very pricey and some of them moved way too fast. The Mathmos moves at a good speed, is very clear, and is larger then I thought it would be (obviously the farther away the projector is the larger the image will be, but it's clear enough to be pretty far away)Anyway a couple small down sizes about the Mathmos are; 1st it takes about 45 minutes to fully heat up so at first the image, if you have oil in the projector, is just one color, but after it heats up it is very pretty and relaxing. 2nd it doesn't have an on off switch so you have to unplug it to turn it off. Over all the Mathmos is great, I definitely recommend this product! I love it and so does my son! A+ :-D"
2,La-ame,THIS MOVIE WAS SO LAME I WAS ALL LIKE DIS WAS LAME. I CAN NOT BELIEVE THAT THIS WAS A MOVIE. I MUCH RATHER NOT WATCH ANYTHING THEN WATCH THIS. I GIVE THIS MOVIE TWO METEORITES DOWN. WAAAAAAAAAAAY DOWN. If you want to see something with substance go see NOT THIS.
5,Love the smell!,It has a long lasting smell which smells great. I have been using this for the last two years. Great product!
4,"High And Lonesome, Extremely Genuine...","High Lonesome Sound, a very accurate description of the extraordinaire musician Roscoe Holcomb, a man gifted with many musical talents, able to master banjo, guitar, slide, violin, harmonica, with a high pitched, untrained, steadily controlled voice that could make the dead roll over. Roscoe possessed an overall sound like no other, here within lies something eerie and unique to be heard, listen and learn to ""Swanno Mountain"", ""The Hills Of Mexico"", ""Mississippi Heavy Water Blues"", ""Coney Isle"", ""Knife Guitar"" - some of the best slide you'll ever hear - twenty six appalachian blues/folk songs guaranteed to take you ""way out"" in the Smokies. Definitely a different listening experience from Smithsonian Folkways, more dynamic and uneasy than Dock Boggs. Roscoe Holcomb - ""I come from the country, where nobody bothers us except ourselves"". Welcome to the ""Holcomb zone""."
3,Well done but underdone. A great underacheivement!,"This movie went far, just not far enough. It brimmed with intriguing thought-provoking dialogue offered via reasonably consistent quality acting. Exploration of the few characters in cast was above stereotypical. As a thought-provoking medium on de-Nazification of post-war Germany it scores on several levels, however the tragedy is that this movie held within it's immediate grasp seeds of magnificient opportunity which might have bloomed with a bit more complex plotwork. As a result, it felt more like a 'piece of a movie', for just as another 'session' of the interrogating winds down and you expect a plot twist to flare, the end credits start rolling when you're halfway through your popcorn."
4,Luck Starbuck,Luke Starbuck is born in this book. He is top hand for Mr. Langham owner of the LX ranch. All the ranchers in the territory of north Texas are losing horses to thieves. Luck is hired by the ranch owners to be their range detective and seek out the rustlers. He does so by joining up with a gang. The story is easy going and smooth. Regarless of the other persons review stating he does not like the ending I thought it was just the way it could happen; with Luke making very quick and smart decisions under pressure.
2,"Nice, but out of date","Unless you're still running 7 or 8i, I can't recommend this book. As another reviewer noted, Oracle has added a lot of XML features in 9i and 10g. The content itself is great -- the authors should consider a second edition that covers the current Oracle XML features."
3,Good reference for old versions of Oracle,"This book was written in 2000, prior to 9i, which has added a lot of functinality. If you already know XML well and need to augment the rather pathetic Oracle Press books and Oracle On-Line documention, then this is the best book I have read. Many of the examples used in the book do not reflect the real-world examples I have had to deal with, so keep an open mind.Many XML details are assumed by the author or are skipped-over entirely, so if you do not know XML, pick-up an XML book at the same time.The book is dominated by Java; relatively little PL/Sql coverage."
3,Good very first book,This book is good for the very young and for those who know little if anything about carving. We wanted a book that goes quick after a particular project such as carving a nose or an ear or an eye but the book was very slow to complete a rather middle of the road project. We were searching for a book that effectively flows quicker than showing each stoke.We wanted and expected to see more than a few particular woods that a carver would target for a particular project and the book fell short of our expectations.
4,Shows detail on woodcarving faces,This is the second book I have bought for woodcarving. I liked it a lot. The instructions were easy to follow to produce good quality faces. One of the things I had difficulty to find is the type of bark is describing specially in the area in Mexico I live in.
1,don't buy LaCie drives; they die before their time,"I bought a 60 GB LaCie Pocket Drive USB2/Firewire drive in August 2003, for $349.95 from Microwarehouse. Died December 2004, 3 months after manufacturers warranty ended.Customer service was unhelpful, told me that there are only 4 manufacturers out there, and all have the same warranty. So I'm out $350.00.My company also bought a LaCie d2 FireWire , 80 GB (300656) Hard Drive, which died after 3 months."
4,The ball,The ball it self is great it is the pump I found not so great. It is very hard to use and it fell apart many times. The ball could use something to stop the air from coming out after you have filled it. But the ball is great.
2,Very Difficult to Inflate!,I got this as a recomendation to help me exercise my knees and I had a 45 minute workout just trying to inflate the darn thing! It comes with a very small and VERY CHEAP foot pump to inflate this HUGE ball. After I finally got it unflated it was fine.
1,Barely functional,The material for this ball is too thin so it cannot be inflated sufficiently to be a secure platform for the strength and balance exercises I like.
1,Obvious cracks in plastic,"First of all, this ball smells TERRIBLE, and is coated with some sort of waxy/greasy substance. I know that sounds like a disgusting joke, but it's true! I inflated the ball per the instructions, and once inflated, it had OBVIOUS cracks in the plastic. I'm 8.5 months pregnant, and I""m so happy it didn't pop while I was on it. Amazon is totally awesome at returns and shipping, as always. This product is mediocre, and possibly dangerous. Returning tomorrow!"
1,not durable,"I didn't use this ball very much (twice a week at top), but it developed a leak in 5 months. Very disappointed. Not durable."
4,It's a Big Ball,Great product for the price. Very happy with my Valeo Body Ball. I use the ball as an office chair. Works great.
2,Check the sizes!!!,"Either this ball doesn't pump up to the full 55cm or the description and estimations are wrong. I'm not quite 5'3"" and I have short legs. So, based on reviews I had read this ball sounded like it should work. Short with short legs... Nope. It was still too small. I did like the ball itself and the pump that came with it. So, I bought the 65cm ball which has worked out well. That one, however, does not pump up to the full 65cm without getting to hard to work with. If you're going to buy a stability ball make sure you ask a trainer or someone which size would work best for you based on your leg length and not necessarily your height."
5,awesome!,very big compared to normal exercise balls. I am 6'6'' and 265 lbs. it suits me just fine. I use it to sit at my computer and to play video games. (yes how ironic) it smelled really funny at first but it fades after a week or two. shoes will make black marks on it if that matters to you. the pump worked very well and was easy to use.
5,Holds Air.,"Five stars for holding air. I really don't know how you can review these as I'm no expert in ""Body Balls"" but I do use it frequently. It holds air and even takes a few good nips from my puppy. I think the endurance is well worth 5 stars."
4,Held up,"This thing has held up for almost a year now, and I have to say that I'm impressed. You do have to refill it every so often, but it is easy enough with a small hand or mechanical pump. I don't know how much it helps me stay in shape, but my fiance loves it and I don't mind watching."
2,Be careful !,"This ball is huge I ordered the largest ball because I'm 6'0 tall. This ball was as big as my living room chair. I had to beat on it to get it through the doorways of my house. I also faceplanted off of it onto the livingroom floor, broke my glasses, and still had my lower body up on the ball from a simple reverse crunch. Be careful you have to really learn how to keep your balance on these balls. It is not just a toy. I no longer have mine because my cat popped it when my son sat her on it and she pushed off with her claws. I would suggest getting a smaller size to begin with and get one of the videos to teach you how to use it."
3,Pump!,"Make sure you know that you need a pump for this thing. Ordered it for work to use instead of a chair and it has been in the box for about 2 years b/c I don't have a pump at work. I am also too lazy to bring one in, so i should only get a 2 star review for myself."
2,"NOT 75 CM, WRONG SIZE","I specifically ordered the ball because I wanted a 75cm ball, this ball is much smaller and does not fit the tape that it comes with, the tape remains slack. That is the biggest disappointment for me. The ball works fine for a smaller ball but what's the point of paying for it if it's not the size you want? I was deployed when it was shipped, so I am too late to return it and either way I would have to open the box and blow it to see the size.I hope someone lets Valeo know of this discrepancy."
4,Good Ball,"Although a different color might have been nice, this ball has been great. Blowing it up is a bit of a hassle because I don't like the foot-pump. However, it's a great addition to my P90X2 work out!Just a warning though: The ball reeks. And use your mattress pump for most of it!"
1,Wrong size - Blew up!,"I ordered a 65 cm ball (I love them and have 2 already!). I started blowing it up, the pump split in half (fixed it with duct tape), and kept trying to blow it up to fit the inside diameter of the measuring tape. I inflated the ball to ~65% and it exploded into 15-18 pieces (smells really bad, BTW...). My guess is that there was a blue 55 cm ball in a 65 cm box. The only markings on the ball were ""N 163"". I was unable to correlate this online with any Valeo product to ensure the correct diameter size. Sooooooo, BE CAREFUL!"
5,"If you love big balls, this is the one for you...","I bought two of these balls and let me tell you, they're GREAT! nice and bouncy and feel good and grippy in my hands. my girl loves working out with them too."
1,"Poor quality ball, poor quality pump","I read the instructions carefully, and tried to inflate the ball as described in the instructions.First, the included cheapie plastic pump split a seam within 3 minutes. Since the ball can't be inflated with a standard sports ball needle, we had to jerry-rig a patch for the pump, and continued to try to inflate the ball with a (now) leaking pump.15 minutes later, taking turns because it was so difficult, we got the ball *almost* fully inflated, according to the included measuring tape. Deciding not to press our luck, we got the plug ready, pulled out the inflation nozzle, and the ball popped straight down the center.Let me emphasize this: WE DID NOT OVER-INFLATE THE BALL. The manufacturer-provided measuring tape, which we had CAREFULLY strung around the middle of the ball, ensured this.The ball is too fragile, the pump is WAY too fragile, and I wish I'd spent the extra $10 for a better-quality product."
1,Not good quality,"When I took it out of the box, besides its extremely strong chemical odor, I noticed it seemed to have some kind of wet substance all over it that rubbed off on my hands when I touched it (the consistency of lotion). I have no idea what it was. On the plus side, it comes with a measuring tape to let you know when it is inflated enough. However, the pump that comes with it was extremely labor intensive and a lot of pumping didn't accomplish much. The smell and the wet feel of the plastic was enough for me. I'm going to buy another higher quality brand. I guess you get what you pay for!"
1,kissing concrete,"The 75cm Valeo Body Ball (""burst resistant"" per the box) performed faithfully for seven months until it ruptured yesterday. I am 6'4"", 200# and was prone using two 10# dumbbells when it burst beneath me and dropped me face first on the smooth concrete floor. The tear was nearly fully circumferential around the middle of the ball. Fortunately, I only had a couple of small abrasions. The ball had no previous damage, leak or or other warning sign of weakness or impending failure. It was replaced with a more expensive, stronger ball that is now used with a thick foam exercise mat underneath."
2,Burst my bubble,"This product worked well fro me until it popped when I was using it. I am well within the weight limits of the ball and it burst after only a couple months. I had inflated it using the tools provided. On the plus side they did send a replacement. If you want to do this right, put the extra money down for one of the gym quality balls, this could be you by but may surprise you one of these days."
3,Hope the ball lasts longer than the pump...,"Got one of these stability balls for stretching and to use with workouts. It was on clearance for $5 at Marshalls so I bought it. I'm on the short side (5'7""), so the 55cm was actually a good fit for me. Great for engaging core during exercises.With the ""tape measure"" ring it was easy to pump it to the correct inflation size. Bad news, however was that the pump failed on me after only partial inflation. Lucky thing I own a multi-use hand pump (for bikes, balls, etc.) and rigged the cap adapter to work on my pump.The ball itself is very high quality, like those you find at your local gym. Thickness is a medium (heavier duty than Everlast and Altus) Hasn't popped or had any leaks on mine yet. So if you need a good affordable stability ball and own a hand pump (just in case), give these a try.4/2011 - ball recently got a small puncture hole and started to leak after over a year of vigorous use."
1,Wrong Color,"I was trying to order the large silver ball to use as a desk chair, and I clicked on that color. When there was a red ball at check-out, I assumed that it was the generic photo of the item. Just in case, I did a second order, clicking on the silver box again. Nothing came up telling me that it wasn't available, or that it came only in red. (Several colors were shown in the boxes below.) You guessed it: a bright red ball arrived, clashing with everything in the room. Whether or not it's a high-quality item isn't the reason for my poor review, just the inconvenience of having to re-pack and ship... Next time, I would like to know what colors are, and are not, available."
2,Got wrong size ball,"Like other buyers, I too got the wrong size ball - 55 cms Blue ball. Unfortunately I waited too long to inflate it so have missed the return window and am stuck with a ball I cannot use. Advise to other buyers- dont wait too long to evaluate the product. I am 5'7"" and bought this ball to use at my work desk. Now I cannot use it because its too short and I will have ergo issues (which I thought I would fix with the Ball, in the first place). Waste of money."
1,wrong size in the box,"ordered size 65cm... the shipping was fast, but after pumping up the ball, I realized it was 55cm only. Although the box printed 65cm, the measuring tape (which is part of the package) was much longer than the ball. So I have to return for an exchange, and hopefully the new one will come at the right size.will update again once I receive the new ball."
3,Exercise Ball,Good sturdy product with a great wall chart for doing exercises. A bit difficult to inflate to the proper size. Directions for that part were not clear.
3,"ball is good, pump is not","no complaints about the ball itself, but the airpump leaks-- i had to borrow my friend's to pump it up."
2,Definitely not 75 cm,"I was very excited to receive this product today, but it became fairly clear as soon as I started inflating it that it would be nowhere near the advertised 75 cm diameter. I followed the inflation instructions, using the tape, and there is no way the tape can be tight on the ball.Also, I don't recommend using the pump. Mine cracked shortly after I started inflating the ball."
2,All Different Sizes,"I purchased three (3) of the 65 cm stability balls for circuit training boot camps I run. When they arrived and I blew them up, each of the three balls were a different size. I blew all of them up the most I could and undoubtedly they are all different sizes. I did not want to hassle with returning them, so I make due, but in the future I will not buy this brand for my fitness studio due to the inconsistencies."
2,Not quit a ball,"I am not sure what I expected from the cheapest ball out there. The ball is egg shaped. I used the measuring strap and did not over inflate it. I don't know if this is common or not, but I would not buy another one."
4,Good Product For the Price,I paid about $12 for this ball and it was a great bargin for the price. I have seen similarly priced balls sell at about $20. Included in the packaging is a foot pump which is very handy (this was not listed in the description when I bought the ball). The only reason that I am giving this product a four star rating is because it has a tendency to deflate more quickly than other excercise balls I have used in the past.
3,Too small for me; go up a size if you're on the line,"I wasn't sure which size to buy; the description advised a 55 cm ball for 5'1"" to 5'3"" and a 65 cm for 5'4"" to 5'7"" or something. I'm on the borderline at 5'3 1/2""-ish, but I ordered the 55 cm because I didn't want it to be hard to maneuver doing leg work. I should have ordered the next size up. My fiance (who is a physical therapist aid and inflates these balls all the time at work) inflated it for me and when I sit on the ball I am too low to the ground to do crunches or anything (my thighs are not parallel to the ground so my butt is too low and I slide right off). I weigh 115 lbs. so I know I am not too heavy for the ball. Ladies, if you're on the line, go up a size!"
2,Very Small,"This ball is super small. It says ""75cm,"" but it's smaller than the 65cm ball I used when I went to physical therapy for my hips while pregnant."
3,Valeo Body Ball,Product was received with a broken connection on the inflation deviseValeo Body Ball (75 cm)
3,Ball,"Using a metric system for advertising I ended up with a ball too large for the exercises. Additionally, the chart that accompanied the ball was not for the size received. As a result the exercises are limited to those that work with the ball. No other choice was available at the time."
1,ball split into two equal sized pieces,"I enjoyed the ball for about three weeks, but I discovered it split in two pieces one day for no known reason. I plan to get another, but not this brand."
2,Body Ball Blue 65cm,"The 'blue' body ball that was sent to me was not blue. It's white with some blue print. The pump didn't work right so I used a rocket type pump that came with a ball I had purchased from another company. Plugs and pumps seem to be interchangeable. The quality of the 'blue' ball is good. When I opened the box it looked like the ball was the wrong size but it expands to the 65cm. My first thought was wrong color, wrong size. No inflation directions enclosed in box only an excercise chart. Ball is OK, pump is not. I was not happy but didn't want the return hassle. If you aren't fussy about color and have a back-up pump, go for it."
2,Size not as described...,"The 65cm ball is quite a bit smaller than advertised. I inflated it pretty good and it's still a lot smaller. If you want a true 65cm ball perhaps you should get the bigger size ball. The foot pump is cumbersome to use but if you only have to inflate it once it's not that terrible. The material also has a strong smell, and actually made me feel a bit ill after using it."
2,Bought 65cm but got 55cm,Ball seemed nice but realized its a 55cm even though I had ordered 65cm. I notice few others have the same issue. I am returning this product.
1,Wrong size,Seems to be a trend that they are shipping the wrong size ball. The box correctly said 65cm but after trying to blow this up for 20 minutes I realized I could not get it any larger and the measuring tape was off by many inches. The ball diameter is for 55cm. The tape seemed to be the right size for a 65cm ball though.I'm sending back for another try. If things work out I'll update my review based on the ball itself and not the shipping (Or packaging) mistakes.
2,Horrible Plastic Smell,"I could barely stand to blow up the ball without opening the window. All parts (ball, pump, and measuring tape) smelled of cheap plastic. I washed it in the shower with soap and water to try to get the smell off, but it didn't help. I'm leaving the window open for another 24 hours to continue to let it air out before I spend much time around it. (I don't think that vinyl smell is healthy.) The plastic also feels thinner than the previous exercise balls I've had in the past. It was the cheapest ball of that size on Amazon, and I guess I got what I paid for. I'd rather have spent twice as much had I known that it would be made of such cheap materials."
1,Poor Product with Missing Parts,"I ordered this brand-new from amazon.com. But after I inflated the ball, it kept deflating. According to the instruction manual, a plug and a tape measure should have been included. Neither were included in the box. Very annoying! I am returning it for a refund. Don't waste your $$$."
1,POP,"After having this ball for only 2 weeks, it popped while I was sitting on it, not moving, on carpet. Not a fun experience for someone with a bad back."
3,Yellow?,I can not say to much about this ball because I have not used it which is why I gave it an average three stars. I am writing this because I just got it and am discouraged by the color. It sounds weird but I really wanted a gray ball so I was excited to get this one because the picture shows it as a gray. I opened the box to find that it is an odd yellow white color. They should have been specific with the color:/
2,cheap,"Owned for 1 week...no instructions for inflation w/ included foot pump. ball sheds strips of plastic from all the seams and was covered in a greasy residue that was very hard to remove. it stinks, the pvc or whatever, off-gases a very strong chemical smell that washing has not lessened. It has to stay in the garage because it stinks up any room it's in. holds air reasonable well. buy something else. made in china, of course."
2,Only good for small people!,"This is a decent ball, but not if you're over 150lbs. The rubber is thinner than some other companies (like Gymnic), so the ball tends to flatten out when you're using it, giving very little resistance. I have a Gymnic ball as well, which holds shape beautifully, and I'd recommend that."
4,Good for the price,"I have used this ball quite a bit with my Denise Richards ""Shrink Your Female Fat Zones"" video (also purchased on Amazon) and really enjoy it. It really helps with my crunches, and is easier on my back. The air pump was a little awkward, but once I got the hang of it, the pump worked fine."
3,A little too short to use in the office,"I bought this with the intent of using this at the office, but it's too short. Before I bought this one, I checked the sizes of the balls at my gym. The 55cm I was sitting on was the right size, so I ordered this one. Turns out that 55cm means different things to different manufacturers."
5,Good Looking and Sturdy,"This ball works great. I am 5'4"" and this ball is perfect for me. I have had it for a few months and I use it a lot. It's white and surprisingly shows no signs of dirt or hard use. The rubber surface keeps you in position on the ball. A great buy."
3,Acceptable ball,Ball was as advertised. Pump a little cumbersome. Pump had a little tear in the tubing that i patched up with tape before I could use it.
1,Ball was unusable within 30 days,"This balance ball arrived with a very cheap inflating pump. After fighting with it to stay together long enough to inflate the ball, and enduring a terrible chemical smell from the ball (the package was labeled that it contained cancer causing toxins), we finally had a balance ball. Unfortunately, it sprung a leak within 30 days from normal use. I'm returning it. So glad Amazon has a good return policy!"
3,ok,This ball is fine with this price. It has been about a month since I bought. The ball started softer and softer. I guess I have to fill the air up time to time.It would be better if seller mentions air pump is included.
1,won't stay inflated. cheap & worthless. sending it back.,"The pump nozzle cracked down the middle within minutes. Took forever to blow up. The ""measuring tape"" that came with mine was completely the wrong length. The ball won't stay inflated & on mine the stopper just keeps popping out. Cheap cheap cheap. Am returning and do not reccommend this product."
3,SOOO BIG!,It took an entire evening to pump up the ball. Then when it was pumped to specifications per the tape measure included it was huge! This is the size according to the website for my height but I couldn't touch the floor. I had to let air out of it. I would suggest finding one in a store to see what size you really need. Other than that its fun!
5,Better than a couch,"I got this ball because I didn't want to sit on my couch anymore because it made me feel lazy. Now I sit on the ball or I stand around to watch TV. I think it's awesome because no matter what, I'm always moving around, even when I'm not working out. The ball comes with an instruction manual for exercising and I've used it quite a bit for that but mainly for just sitting around when I'm tired. The pump it comes with isn't that great but I had a bike pump that DID work well so it didn't matter much to me. Overall, I love it."
1,valeo ball,"When i received this item not only did they send me the wrong type of air pump so i could not inflate it; after trying various of other pumps i realized the item was defective, the inside of the ball was made wrong and it was all stuck together so there was no way to inflate it with any type of air pump. By the time i realized it was defective the expiration date of sending it back was over due. I would say if you are looking to get an exercise ball do NOT go with this one choose a different one"
2,Good ball but needs better instructions,"I have had several exercise balls in my life and none of them were as challenging to inflate as this one. The instructions were vague and didn't explain how to use the ""tools"" which still confuses me. The ball attracts every piece of dust and lint and hair, but maybe after washing it off it will perform better."
2,Incorrect item in box,"Twice in a row I received a 65cm ball within a box labeled for the 75cm ball. That's right. The wrong ball in the box on two different orders. Valeo may be a good company and the ball looked like it was well built, but beware that their packaging may be inaccurate. Amazon is correcting this error by helping me to get another ball at the same low price, but I will not risk purchasing from Valeo again."
4,Good,This ball is exactly what to be suspected. It is easy to use and the exercise poster that comes with it is convenient. It easily held my weight. It smelled a tiny bit coming out of the bag but the smell went away quickly.I would buy one again.
4,is what it says,exactly what you expect: a big blue exercise ball. Bought it fo my wife's labor and it was great. Could be easier to fill/plug but good overall.
3,Ball seems smaller than it should be...,Pump is pretty cheap quality too. Ended up giving it to my wife and getting a 75CM ball.
1,Disappointment,"This ball is too small for an adult, even a small adult..... I bought this for my 5' mother & it was way too small!"
1,Shape doesn't hold well,I purchased two of these and both stretched out at one spot and are no longer circular. Not used by heavier folks and not used often. Would not recommend.
1,Cheap and flimsy air pump,"The air pump is cheap and flimsy. It took me 25 minutes to inflate this ball and towards the end of it the spring in the pump broke so now it's useless. Once inflated, the ball lives up to its expectations but now if I have to reinflate it I have to go to buy a new pump. I'd suggest buying a exercise ball that's Made in the USA."
1,"really BAD ordor/smell, Do NOT buy","I bought this ball from a local big5 sports store, smells like toxic chemicals. I wonder why the heck they use such low quality material if they expect people to touch/skin contact the ball.I also highly doubt the many people who gave this product 5 stars have their nose plugged when they use it.Anyways, I come here to look for some fitness balls made of safe, high quality materials. Any suggestions will be appreciated."
2,Broke after a little while,"After a few short months of use as a chair, the ball developed a leak and stopped doing, well, its duty of being an inflated ball. I found the leak, covered it with some glue, and pumped it up several times, but it always deflated. I wish my $12 had lasted a bit longer.Otherwise, this 55cm ball was a good size (I'm 5'3""). You can't choose the color (55cm is pearly white). The pump is easy to use but takes a while, slips often, and makes an loud squeaking sound. Also it's made of cheap plastic, and ripped along a top edge eventually. Was easily repairable with a piece of duct tape."
3,Size is wrong,I ordered a 75cm ball but the arrived ball is at most 65cm.I am too lazy complainning or returning so I have to live with it. I am only 5'4'' so it is fine for me but my hubby is 6' and he could use a real 75cm ball. Otherwise the product is fine. We all love to sit on it watching TV ! We also do free weights on it and other routines.
2,VERY Fragile,"This teapot looks very good and makes great tea. Unfortunately, my praise ends there. This product has a flawed design. There is no mechanism for easy removal of the infuser. The infuser itself was made to be taken out (there are retractable prongs), but there is no way to carefully do this. When I tried to clean it, the glass broke (this was the first time I had ever used it, and I am a reasonably careful person). Also, broken glass is NOT covered under Bodum's warranty. My advice is to stick with cast iron pots. They are more expensive, but they last forever under normal conditions."
3,Perfect for one or two people,"I've always been a Bodum fan and I've had two of these in my kitchen. It's the perfect size if you're having tea for one or two. The nozzle stains when you frequently use it but it doesn't pose a problem. Design is sleek, it's lightweight and easy to clean. Only catch is that if you're not careful, it also easily breaks."
4,Great tea pot,The only thing I would change it to make it a bit heavier glass. The glass is kin if thin and seems too fragile
4,parts drawer,"The product is exactly what was advertised and what we wanted. However, it arrived with the plastic front on one of the drawers broken. It was packed poorly, with no packing at all around the cabinet inside the shipping box."
3,"Nice cabinet for the sale price, overall good buy","Nice cabinet, gets the job done for hardware. Thin metal and plastic drawers. Not bad overall, was worth it at the sale price"
3,Over Priced,"The cabinet is what it is, and I'll keep it, but the plastic parts, especially the drawer dividers don't fit well, and the labels are the wrong size. Those are minor issues and may be overcome, but for over $100 for the product, you'd think they wouldn't exist!"
5,Awesome wrist rest,I've been looking for a Gel Keyboard Wrist rest for a while and so glad I found this one! VERY comfortable and pleasant to rest your wrist with. Highly recommend it!
5,Yizzaayy!,"I was concerned it would be too short as I read some people complaining of that, but it's plenty long enough for my keyboard. Stays put, and is firm enough to support my wrists, but still squishy enough to be squishtastic. A+, mang."
4,A little more hard than I would like it to be.,"This wrist rest for the keyboard is just a bit too hard for my wrists. It is well made and is holding up well but more on the hard side than soft side. It does do the job of keeping the hands/wrists up at a good ergonomic angle though.Also, the wrists tend to stick to it more than the other wrist rests that have a material over them. So , if your wrists are not sensitive this is the item for you."
5,My Life Depends on This Being Released!,"...okay, not really. But it would be nice to be able to finish the series. I went into the first season knowing full well I was introducing myself to crushing disappointment (by the lack of other seasons), yet I did it anyway. Picket Fences, Ally Mcbeal, The Pracitce, Pepper Dennis, Boston Public, EVERWOOD. These are the shows we need. I realize that it may be cash-consuming, but we as Everwood fans must rise up and show our heads (so to speak)! The revolution is NOW! Overdramatic? Pah! I don't know what you're talking about."
5,Everwood the best TV sitcom,"I watched Everwood faithfully when it aired. I purchased the first season DVD set and watched again the awesome shows. I was very upset that Everwood went off the air. I was more upset that I could not purchase the other seasons on DVD. Today I was notified of the soon to be released second season DVD ""whoo hoo"" I just finished ordering the long awaited DVD!!! I hope many others order DVD'S I would love to see the show return."
5,More Everwood magic,I'm a big Everwood fan and think it's one of the best shows in recent years. The Second Season is every bit as enjoyable as the first one. I've been waiting ages for it to be released. Hopefully Seasons 3 and 4 will follow suit soon.
4,A great series!,We waited forever (it seemed like) for season 2 of Everwood. What a great series. Not many extras on the DVD but the series was so great it doesn't matter. Eagerly awaiting Season 3!
5,Everwood is amazing!,"I wasn't too sure how I felt about the show when my parents first started watching it, back when Season One was released. However, I got into it. And it is such a beautiful story. Doesn't seem like you get that with what they put on TV these days. I just ordered this season and can't wait to get it. I really want Season Three next!"
5,underrated show,i've watched this show from start to finish and i must say it's probably one of the best shows ever...the writing was the best out of all the tv show dramas that WB(CW) had at that particular time...it was kind of stupid that they cancelled everwood in place of 7th heaven...7th heaven to me was a joke and countless other show's they had on WB...the acting on the show was terrific and the cast ensemble worked great together...i hope season 2 comes out on dvd soon...and if i lived in LA i would buy the 7th heaven dvd's and chuck it at the CW building!!! hoping to hit the building itself or Happy the dog from 7th heaven!!
5,the best show ever better than the shows around today,I love everwood it was the best show in its days and this show still puts other shows to SHAME. Bottom line is the WB should realese SEASON 2 for all who loved and still love this show so please help us put everwood SEASON 2 on a box set in the near month or year. Thank you
5,One of My Favorites,This is one of my all-time favorite series. It's even more fun since I am a resident of Salt Lake and can pick out many of the locations where filming took place.I'm in line for the next two seasons - please hurry!
5,Thrilled about the second season!,It is very exciting to hear that the second season of EVERWOOD is going to be released on DVD in June! EVERWOOD was such a well-written show with wonderfully quirky and poignant characters. I own the first season DVDs and I was afraid I would never see anymore than that. I will gladly buy each of the remaining seasons just as soon as they are released!
5,JAPAN is also waiting for more Everwood!!!,"My American friend recommended Everwood to me and I have become a great fan. I have been waiting and waiting for the release of season 2. I have read all the books but would really like to see the rest on DVD. Recently, they have started showing Everwood on Japanese Cable, and I am sure that the rest of the Japanese population will soon be with me asking to see the rest on DVD. So please let us see more!"
5,OMG!! It's about time!!,SOOOOO excited this is finally coming out on DVD!! It's about time... this is one of the best shows that was out there...so stupid that they got rid of it! Can't wait!!
5,the proverbial GOOD drama,i have seen many dramas over the years. and i can honestly say that this is the ONLY good drama to me. The characters are sensitive but flawed human beings with real problems. The show avoids several key pitfalls. It doesn't descend into the supernatural (IE Smallville). It doesn't have characters killed off meaninglessly (IE Lost). It doesn't have unnecesary plot twists (IE Lost and Desperate Housewives). The characters are sensitive human beings with real problems. It doesn't shy away from any topic (IE anything from the 80's on back) and it doesn't shove a religious conservative agenda down our throats (IE 7th Heaven).
5,Everwood is Real,This is by far the best show that has ever come on TV. I was heartbroken when it was canceled. I started watching after my mother was killed in a car wreck and I've never been able to relate to a character as much as I relate to Ephrem. It was beautifully written and the actors were great. I guess I'll be recording it of the TV so I can get the rest of the seasons. Fine by me.. that just means less money for WB.
5,FREAKIN AMAZING!,Please give us the other seasons! I cannot wait to add them to my collection. An amazing series that does not have the attention it deserves.
5,Excellent series,Beats the crap out of the reality stupidity we're stuck with watching today. At least it has some substance to it.
5,great product -- horrible shipping,"I have ordered two of these from this vendor. Both times the product was received almost a month after I ordered it. The product is nice and of good construction, but again if you need this in a hurry, choose another place because they dont know how to mail it right out."
3,"Good quality, but NOT jumbo as advertised.","This beanbag chair is well made and seems durable, but it is not jumbo as described. Other drawbacks are it's odd tall shape instead of uniformly round and pretty rigid instead of mushy like the jumbo one I do have that's lasted several years. Price was decent, but with shipping jacked it up high, so probably will buy next beanbag chair locally where you can get them for less and avoid high shipping fee."
5,Great Product,The bean bag chairs are great. My child loves it and the price was great too. I would buy this again. Some have reviewed this and said shipping was a problem. I ordered three on Thursday and they all arrived on the followingMonday.
5,A must have for a serious scholar of Historical Christanity,A classic study of the integrity of the New Testament text and the genuineness of the New Testament books.
5,LOVE Robin Williams!,"I haven't watched this movie in a long while and came across it when I was looking for stocking stuffers. My Husband, myself, and two kids popped some pop corn and all of us were laughing out loud the whole movie. I forgot how funny it was."
5,Great History,To understand the founding of our great country it is essential to understand the people and their thoughts during their lives. This book tells the true story instead of the re-written history we find in so many books today.
5,Excellent inspirational book,This is an excellent and inspirational book. Reading of the dedication and sacrifice of the men who literally staked their lives and fortunes to found our nation is humbling and should inspire in us a wealth of gratitude. I heartily recommend this book to every American.
5,Great informaton about the Signers,"Written in 19th century English, the book reviews the lives of the men who signed the Declaration. Simple and direct, no attempts for ""political correctness"", very refreshing. This book should be part of every American's personal library."
5,Insight on the Sacrifices and Challenges of Our Nation's Founders,"When our out-of-state daughter was homeschooling her seven children, this book helped them to understand the difficulties, sacrifices and challenges faced by our nation's founding fathers. Excellent book!"
5,torrente 2: Mission in Marbella,I am satisfied with the product. The picture is great. Its very funny and I like it. Torrente is hilarious movie with a hispanic humor .
1,Parts Don't Fit Together Well,Revell could have had a winner with this kit. Instead they made a poorly crafted model in which the parts do no fit together well. It's bad craftsmanship and frustrating. Stick to Tamiya models. They are well made and have great customer service; I once found a part missing in a Tamiya kit and e-mailed them for a replacement... It arrived within days.
2,Buyer beware.,"I imagined that this would be a good father/son project. However, I had to build most of it alone. If you appreciate precision fit, you won't find it in this kit. Epoxy is not fun to work with. Cementing little metal nuts to plastic and then finding later that the holes don't line up can be extremely frustrating. Eventually, I got it together. It works, looks impressive, etc. However,this is not the ideal project to create a bonding experience between father and son...unless you have some M-80's, lighter fluid, or a sledge hammer."
2,Frustrating,"I ignored the other bad reviews and bought this item anyway. I have been working on it night after night trimming pieces and cutting them trying to make everything work correctly. If you just want to put an engine together without it functioning correctly then get it, if your a perfectionist and want this thing to work perfect you may be suicidal by the time your done lol"
1,Buyer beware is right!,It doesn't fit together well at all! The instructions are not well written. Very frustrating. It's going in the trash. Really too bad because my son and husband were very excited about this project. All it did was waste hours and patients.
2,Great Idea,"I bought this because my son is always asking how an engine works, I thought this would be a great project for him and my husband to do together. The build is so difficult and there are so many parts I don't know if they will ever finish it. I wish that the amount of parts and the build time to make it was less."
3,Revell engine,It was too hard for my son (9) to do it himself. But it was a great father-son project.
1,Junk,"This model is absolutely junk. Nothing positive to say about this product at all. DONT BUY IT! Nothing fits together at all, pieces warped and molded poorly."
2,Epoxy cement is a mess. molded construction is very poor,"I remember the original with little lights to represent spark plug ignition. This is a cost-reduced copy of poor construction and badly fitting components that require a LOT of post-mold re-engineering. It's a great learning tool, but a very badly produced copy of the originaly excellent quality model. I would recommend it only in the sense that it it appears to be the only one available, but it is by no means the quality that Revell used to deliver. Over-all, I would not buy it again."
2,Not as I remember,"I built one of these as a 14 year old and learned quite a bit about how an engine works. Either my memory has gotten worse or this product has. I don't recall as a teen (about 35 years ago)that this thing was so poorly made. The parts don't snap in or line up properly and there is way too many things that don't fit easily or should have been done for you, i.e. glue nuts in tiny notches. All in all, I was quite frustrated and disappointed. Too bad because it has great potential."
2,Smaller than Advertised.,The package states the model is 12 inches. It is more lke 6 inches. Very small and very difficult to get the pieces to fit.
3,not working,the engine looks ok but does not work as the push rods are too short so dont move the valves as they should so very dissapointing when build was complete
4,Visable V-8,"Excellent item. A great learning or teaching tool. Assembly instructions are very lacking, especially for a youngster or someone completely new to engines."
3,very fun but has issues,"i bought and built this engine and it was very fun and had a great time building it. but that being said, the screws and nuts used to build it dont really seem to go with this model. the screwdriver it comes with is useless. the push rods just bend instead of pushing the rocker arms, so your valves and rocker arms are not going to move when you crank the engine. but still was fun to build, and i would buy it again."
4,great challenge,This was a great project to see if I can still assemble a big item with lots of parts.
3,v-8 engine,When I received the engine it came in such a big box that I was surprise how small it is. The engine was quite easy to put together and a lot of fun doing so.
1,A PIECE OF JUNK,THIS IS WITHOUT A DOUBT THE WORST PIECE OF JUNK THAT REVELL HAS EVER PRODUCED IT SAYS ADULT SUPERVISON REQUIRED I'M 78 YRS OLD AND MADE MANY MODEL'S FROM THE TIME I WAS 8YRS OLD INCLUDING LIVE STEAM LOCOMOTIVES PARK SIZE THAT WILL HAUL UP TO 15-20 PERSONS. I GUESS I MUST BE REVERTING TO MY CHILDHOOD IN MY OLD AGE BECAUSE IT WAS ALL MOST IMPOSIBLE TO MAKE PARTS FIT TOGETHER WITHOUT A LOT OF FILING AND SANDING THEN EVEN DID'T FIT VERY GOOD DON'T BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK...
3,books,The book made some good points but was very repetitive Would have made a better magazine article than a book.
5,A must-read for this century even more than the previous one,This book was a gift to me as a Sunday School Teacher about 1969. I have read portions of it at different times for 30 years. This year I started reading in it again and cannot believe how fresh and exciting this message still is. It was like renewing an old friendship. The truth contained in this tiny book has spanned a century with no hint of ever waning. I recommend it fervently to anyone searching for meaning in today's culture.
5,A must for American History,"This is a great, well written History of America. Children love it, but best of all, it tells history accurately while filling in the gaps that a secular education edits out. Religion was an important part of everyday life for Columbus, Washington, Franklin. Secular education takes an atheistic viewpoint and cannot mention this, leaving huge gaps and partial truths. Now you and your children can learn the whole story. Again, a must for teaching grade school age kids about American History. This is our text book this year, companioned with the activity book."
4,A good book for Christian home-schoolers.,"This is a good book for Christian homeschooling moms. I bought it for my daughter, who is homeschooling her children."
1,FALSE ADVERTISING ON A DISCONTINUED ITEM!!!!,"This was one of the most wonderful orthotics ever made. Too bad the item shown and described on this and every retail website is NOT the item this company will ship to you.The company has discontinued this insole, and now substitutes a stiffer, cheaper item, with only PARTIAL gel plugs on the heel and ball of foot areas.

1,Never again,"I have used Solano dryers in the past. They are wonderful! When my last one broke a few weeks ago, I decided to purchase a new one from amazon. I found a reasonable one through Beauty ASAP. Not only the company sent me the wrong dryer, the product was not new. Also, they did not provide the manufacturer's paperwork nor the warranty card. After going back and forth with them for a while, they offered an apology for being unable to provide confirmation about the legitimacy of the dryer. As far as Im concerned, the dryer is not legit! Buyer beware!"
1,HA!HA!HA!,This is the dumbest toy i've ever seen.You are better off with a reguler cell phone with clear sound and pictures.This is a waste of time and money.Hope it gets discontiuned.
5,the best!,the toy is like buying a cellphone with no SAR!! the is the best toy ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Ugly scratch,"This is a cool one, but you see, it's UGLY and when you text message someone, there's alot of scratchy noise."
1,Disappointed - only works within two blocks,"My 10 year old daughter received a pair of these for Christmas from her grandparents. They were really fun on Christmas Day and we were able to chat clearly from different parts of the house. That is the extent of the fun that she has gotten out of this toy.Her best friend lives four blocks away and they are unable to contact each other. I tested the distance by going for a walk while she stayed at home and I lost her after going up the street only two blocks!The picture quality is horrible; it's best just to use the cute character icons that come loaded with the phone. This was a great concept, but your kids will only use it around the house and maybe on the playground at school, if you let them take it. The 2-mile radius is not a realistic claim for any neighborhood.I do not recommend these to anyone."
1,Pretty Sad,"Needless to say, this product is a piece of crap! Did Hasbro seethe demand for this product and throw the casing together to gettheir money???? My nine year old received a pair of these ChatNows for Christmas from Santa. This was the main item and most important item she had asked for. When we inserted the batteries, only one worked. Now what????? We're from Ontario, Canada and have searched everywhere for these and everyone is completely sold out. We even tried Toysrus in the U.S. There are none anywhere. But reading all of these reviews, I might just return these to the store and get some money back. Doesn't sound to me like I should wait for any stock. Thanks for the advice."
3,Glorified Walkie-Talkie,"My daughter is 8 years old. This was the main thing on her list to get. She got it for Christmas from Santa. We open it put the batteries in. Make sure we are on the same channel and what do we here STATIC. You basically talk by using the walkie talkie button. When she went up a floor we were not able to hear eachother at all. I tried to call her phone and was unable to get thru. All of her best friends live on the same street and they were looking forward to being able to talk to eachother, but so far have been unsuccessful. The idea of the phone, being able to text message, take pictures is great, but the phone itself is poor quality. The screen is black and white, which would be dealable if it were clear. Lets just say my daughter and friends have been bitterly disappointed by this toy and have not used them since. A waste of $70. I could have just paid $20 and got them a 5 mile walkie talkie set."
1,BUYER BEWARE,I'm not too surprised to read the other bad reviews on this costly toy. It simply doesn't work in any type of residential area. Who did Hasbro think they'd sell this toy to then? Many of my daughter's friends got this and they were all very excited. They all live in a .75 mile area and none of them can chat. We (the parents) all made sure they were on the same channel and reread the instruction book to make sure they kids were using it proper-- STILL NOTHING. Such a dissapointment from what I thought was a reputable toy company. I've e-mailed Hasbro.. wonder if they'll even bother with responding.
1,i haven't got it.......,i haven't got this toy yet but i look at the reviews and they say this toy is bad this toy is good well i don't know if i should get it or not if it is a bad toy or not i have a 75$ giftcard and my 2 sisters are getting one to and my 1 bro is shareing one with me and i saw that if my 2 sisters are getting one then i could call 1 of them or my bro and we could chat but the thing is that it is only a 2 mile range and i heard that it has some screensavers and alert tones and ringtones and i think that would be cool but the 2 mile range i don't know if that will work and i don't know if i take the batteries out all the stuff will be gone if some one could wright a review that would be great i allways chech the reviews out every day so if someone could help me out that would be great and i want the truth if you do thanks :)
1,WORST TOY IN THE WORLD!!!!!!!,I wanted this toy so badly for Christmas because i thought it was excactly like a cell phone! I got it for christmas and I tried calling my friends house with it.It didnt work!!! THen I relized you could only call people with chatnows!!! No one I knew had chat nows because they all had cellphones! My parents wont let me have a cell. Since it came with two I decided to give one to my friend who lives 4 houses down from me!! It didnt work when I called her. THe connection was bad. Many times I couldnt reach her! I thought it was going to be awesome because it could take pics. but the pictures were horrible! Most of them were just a black screen when I took it!!! RIPP OFF!!!
2,...,"Umm if you really want this product I thinks its a waste of money even if it is free to talk, but you are only getting 2 miles of range. So I really suggest that you get a prepaid camera phone and it would be cheaper. and if kids do you use alot of minutes on the prepaid just take it off of them, but see how responsible they can be with it unless they are under 8 or 9 then you should just get this. that would be smart. the Camera on this is JUNK! and its dumb because i dont think you can talk to your friends that have regular walkie-talkies. So therefore its retarded"
3,ok,"I bought my daughter one on Jan. 2,2006 . was really excited because her girl friend had one but her mother returned hers because she was getting calls from someone that was using very bad language. my daughter is now dissappointed. i want to know if this phones pick up nextel or over phone lines that possible can tap into these phones. my daughters girlfriend mother was so disappointed she returned her phone now my daughter has to find some friends with a chatnow. the photos are very bad but the phone is ok for now. I really think this phone should be cheaper than $70. I would like an rebate. the phone should only allow kids to talk to friends of there choice. Hasbro should return a rebate to all there customers."
1,Back to the drawing board,"What do you think of 2 miles? What do you think of the very stupid, unclear, green camera? I know what I think, I think they should go right back to where they started. They need to lower the price...Dramatically. 70 dollars?! decrease the size! It's huge. And give it 50 miles atleast. This thing is expensive! For what you get you could get a walkie-talkie for 30 dollars. This does not much more then a walkie talkie and the extras in it are pretty boring considering they don't work well and there is very few. They need to make it in color. The ideas great, the actual thing is not."
2,not very good,"I got a chatnow for christmas along w/ my brothers and sister. At first I thought it wouldn't be that bad. When you try and call someone and you are trying to talk to them, there is a VERY LOUD scratching/breaking up noise in the background and it takes a very long time for the call to ""connect"" even when they are 8 ft. away. Then when you try and take a picture, the color is green and very hard to make out what you're trying to take a picture of-unlike the crisp clear black and white picture they show you on the chatnow screen. I don't think that it is a very good product."
2,Not a good Toy for the Money!,"I got this for my niece for Christmas this year and I am very dissatisfied with the product itself. She is enjoying the toys which I am very happy about but for the money it cost it is very cheaply made. It doesn't recharge you have to buy batteries for it,4 per hand held. It has misled the children into believing that they can talk to anyone they wish and that is not the case. They can chat with someone that has a chat now with in a 2 mile radius. I just think that the product is very misleading to children."
1,one doesn't work,"I am 10 years old. I really wanted a Chat Now for Christmas. I received them, but when I put batteries in them on Christmas morning, only one worked. Now they are all out of stock, so I cannot get a new one."
2,Chat now try Chat NEVER!!!!,We bought this toy for our 8 year old son for Christmas. All his friends in the area (within 2 miles) were getting it too. He has been disappointed time and time again. He added all his friends to his buddy list and so far the only one he can talk to lives directly across the street from us. His best friend is two blocks away and is not in range. This toy was a total waste of money and should be named CHAT NEVER!!!
2,Needs,"This phone needs lots, a bigger screen, better pictures, and better reception. PLEASE, 2 miles?! $70?! Why. I'm thinking that adults think kids aren't the greatest...But, in some ways I see why they think I know why they think that way(Kids shouldn't have cellphones), please though, put more miles and a better camera in! I know this is just a toy but I wouls expect this out of a $30 product. This product seems nicely glorified but badly organized. I'll only give an award for the wonderful idea."
5,Must Have Knowledge for Car Buyers,"This book details the steps and provides the reader with the knowledge required to make an educated purchase of a new vehicle. It breaks down the barriers between the dealer and the buyer. No one should step foot into a dealership without reading the information set forth in this book. You will learn how to buy a car below dealer invoice, how to handle the sales tactics used by dealers and the ins and outs of the business. The most important thing you will take from this book is the confidence that you will not fall victim to a savvy dealer because you don't have the right tools to negotiate a fair price. Why? Because this book gives you those tools. I am a young, confident female and I completely feel comfortable walking into a dealership after reading this book. Prior to this, I was hesitant and thought car buying to be a big hassle. Not anymore. Give this book to anyone you know that is purchasing a new car. It will make a perfect college/high school grad. gift."
5,EXCELLENT!,Hassle Free Car Buying is the best I have ever read. Being a female this was so very helpful. I was able to purchase a new vehicle below cost with the help of the Hassle Free Car Buying book. The sales reps were so impressed with me all because of this book. I highly recommend this book to all females of America. Before they talk to any car salesman they must buy a copy of the book. There is a checklist on page 265 that's easy and saves you a lot of time. The auto monthly payment tables were especially helpful too. You can figure out what you want without having to visit a bank or financial institution. It is unbelievable. Go to Amazon.com to purchase. It's so easy. Thank you Hassle Free Car Buying.
5,Excellent book!,Thank you Mr. Jake Jacobs. I read your book named Hassle Free Car Buying and it has all sources of information for a new or used car buyers. I wish all dealers kept your book and gave them to the customers when they meet them. That will be more helpful for the customers. The thing I really like about your book is that I felt as if you put your honest opinion other than gambling. I really appreciate your time to put all these things together. Thank you
4,Bacha-rengue,"Normally I am more a merengue fan, but the bachata disc really was a pleasant surprise. The leadsinger of los Toros Band is one of the great voices of latin music today."
3,Scripture: Dei Verbum,"A real treasure trove for anyone who is minded and serious in truly understanding how the Church regard the Sacred Scripture in relation to Revelation and Tradition along with the Magisterium. This should be a basic resource material for all lay persons seeking a deeper grasp of the faith and particuarly for apologists, catechists and evangelizers of the word of God."
5,Enlightning!,This is one of the best works I've sen on any document from Vatican II. This book makes Dei Verbum much more understandable.
2,Deadly (as in dull),"The wafer-thin plot is dragged out interminably - largely because the ""male"" narrator takes an inordinate length of time to read the ""victim's"" secret diary. Why? If he was that bothered he could've read it in one sitting. But no. And so, along the way, he all but describes the fluff in his navel. Dreary chapters after dreary chapter of his dull, little life are inserted ad nauseum.I have a major problem with the ""male"" narrator. He is inauthentic. Or perhaps I should say he reads like a woman writing male - and not very well - which indeed he is. The novel might well have been more interesting if the narrator had been a lesbian. At least it would have given it a twist.How this ever got published, gawd only knows. When we are told that publishers are overwhelmed by submissions and yet this hokum is the best they can come up with? Something is definately wrong somewhere!"
4,A great debut,"I heard about this book at the World Mystery Convention in Toronto. Littleford was on a panel and she described the story. It sounded interesting enough that I picked up a copy a few months later. I wasn't disappointed. I finished the book in a few days. The plot is simple and compelling, and the portrait of a normal person being twisted by obsession and a desire to escape his mundane life was believably drawn. I picked up Littleford's second book (Death Duty) on the strength of this one.Oh, and to the reviewer who said the book would have been better had the protagonist been a lesbian: If you'd read the book carefully, you might have realized that the turning point in the story (I won't spoil it by saying what it was) hinges on the main character being male. It would not have worked had he been a woman."
2,"I have other Gilad Bodies in motion cd's, this one was the worse out of all the other ones I had...","Gilad is always the greatest. I mean the greatest physical fitness trainer for your living room hands down. That said this video wasn't as good as his others, pass on it."
3,Not bad,"This workout was a little short for me and it did not seem to target the areas as thouroughly as some of his others. But it is a good workout if you are in a hurry, for each one is under 30 minutes!"
1,What do Typos mean to you?,I just had this book delivered and was glancing through it.Figure 1.1 Timescales for a Masters DissertaionWhat does that tell me about the quality of the rest onf the material?
1,Not good,"This is obviously old tape. It would not separate and when it separated it was usually in multiple layers. It was somewhat brittle. That being said, I would order again (different products) from this merchant because when I emailed them about the problem they immediately made it right and would not even let me ship the old stuff back to prove I wasn't ""cheating"" them."
4,"Not standard, Not so bad","As repeated by reviewers below, this is NOT STANDARD textbook on statistical mechanics because it stresses the kinetic theory. If reader would like to learn the equilibrium theory, this book might be embarassing. However, this book is recommended to anyone who is interested in ""unusual"" viewpoint. I prefer Huang to other numerous too standard textbooks. But I am a little disappointed that some interesting topics are removed in the new edition, such as the Chapman-Enskog method.Now, it is NOT SO BAD."
2,One approach.,"Few books on Statistical Mechanics present a treatment with a grounding in the Boltzmann Transport Equation. It is more usual the case that a statistical approach is adopted, in which the canonical (or other) ensemble is arrived, and subsequent results somehow refer back to the the ensembles. Huang seems to wish to proceed from a strongly microscopic and kinetic point of view. There must be great strength in his approach, as statistical phenomena, in reality, is built up from this semi-classical sort of physics. If you like kinetic theory, then buy it. However, for those of us who find more comfort in relating to a more statistical approach, this book is fearsomely unreadable.But do read it for a description of the Boltzmann Transport equation."
1,Unreadable,"The reviewer below who said that this book pursues primarily a kinetic theory - Boltzmann Transport Equation approach, got it right. It really is a fearsome, and by and large, pointless read. Our professor used this book in our stat. mech. class back in 1992. He also used Mahan's Many Particle Physics book in our solid state course and de Genne's Superconductivity text in our superconductor course, so that gives you an idea of what kind of person likes Huang. Most students I've talked to feel that this text is the worst sort of student pain. The pain you feel when after exerting colossal effort trying to understand, you realize at the end of the semester that you didn't learn anything, and that you could have, if only the instructor had chosen one of any number of better books. I am completely mystified as to why and how this book has reached a 3rd edition. Perhaps there are too many physics professors out there who don't care about pedagogy."
1,Ugh.,"We are using Huang in Physics 262 (Statistical Physics). The whole class is utterly lost. The derivation of the Boltzmann transport equation is just painful. The derivation of the Boltzmann distribution is even more painful. The way I know something is wrong with this book: we all read the chapter quite a few times and then looked at the homework problems at the back of the chapter, which are standard enough, and had NO CLUE how to approach them. Now, I am guessing that all fifty or so of us are reasonably intelligent, so the problem must not be with us...."
1,A Reply to the Last Reviewer,"Admittedly, the first review was a bit harsh; nevertheless, it is clear that approximating n! by n ln n - 1 is not sufficient. At large n, this does indeed resemble n ln n - n ,but why include the minus one? Clearly, Huang was not paying close attention. Furthermore, the first three chapters are slapdash and hard to follow. I recommend the Stat Mech book by Pathria in lue of this text."
1,This is the worst textbook I have ever seen.,I just read the reviews and I can not understand why some people have given the book more than a single star let alone like it. It is by far the worst textbook I have ever used. I am baffled that it made it to print. I can only guess that the people who did like it must already know stat mech and have no appreciation for the omissions that make the book completely ineffective for learning. I agree with every negative comment made about this book. It is horrific.
2,Maybe it's me?,"Maybe because my only exposure to Japanese cinema usually involves atomically mutated monsters attacking the island nation, I was not sure what to expect with this movie? I was really hoping that ""Genghis Khan"", would be a film in similar style to ""300"", or perhaps an Asian ""Braveheart"". While ""Khan"" is beautifully shot, I felt the fighting sequences were a little flat, and I had a very hard time rooting for the Mongol leader. I did like the aspects where Khan was trying to understand where he came from, and the dynamic with his son and family wasn't bad, but it wasn't really what I was hoping for. The whole film kind of felt like a ""paint by numbers"" epic, shot and presented by professionals, but lacking ""heart""? (Not sure if that makes sense?) I appreciated what the film makers were trying to do, but the whole experience just falls kind of flat."
2,"Boring, Long and Badly Paced.","I don't know where to begin with this movie ... it could be that the dialogue wasn't translated well to English but some of it at crucial points of angst and drama is just laugh out loud funny, if the movie hasn't already bored you into a deep coma. The scenery is beautiful, but a little bit too clean, it almost has that soap opera veener to it. A little more grit/muted palette would have done it wonders.But those are just nagging points when the main problem is pacing, this movie was way too long and badly structured. And considering the material it had work with, this should have been brilliant and not just fodder for being utterly trashy, and long winded with weak fighting scenes. Skip this movie and seek out Mongol, a movie that is heads and shoulders above this nightmare."
3,Okay acting + Mixed results battle scenes = Worth watching once.,"This movie was made by Japanese.The acting is average.The battle scenes give mixed result. On one hand, it's exciting with real stunts, no CGI. For example, horsemen and horses were beaten and felt to the ground. On the other hand, the sword fighting scenes are messy and not engaging. It's very difficult to see the movements of the fighters. It might be because of bad directing and unskilled actors. Consequently, these scenes are not interesting as those of Hollywood or Chinese movies.The drama's element is okay.In short, it's worth watching once for curiosity. It's better to borrow this from your local library than renting it."
3,The blood of the blue wolf?,"Having only seen a cable special about the Mongol known as Genghis Khan that focused on the ruthless warrior it is nice to see a film that captures the human side of his story. The film manages to cover a vast timeline, and other than the obvious budget constraints succeeds as an engrossing if not sweepingly grand entertainment. The acting is hard to gauge because of the language and sometimes I could tell the subtitles weren't relaying the exact sentiment being displayed in a scene. Also the production values are little clean considering the Nomadic lifestyle the film depicts and the battle and attack scenes while effective feel minimalistic. My only major problem with this effort is the anemic score which fails to convey the emotion contained in many of the scenes and is overused throughout. There are other bigger budget versions of this mans story to be found, but this one has a grounded narrative and appealing cast that make it easy to sit through."
4,"good, 3 1/2 stars","I liked this movie. Yes, it was made by the Japanese but unlike others reviewers I don't see the problem with that. That said, gestures and other mannerisms were culturally Japanese, but it didn't hurt the movie. As a long-time martial artist I can say that the fighting techniques, especially the sword work, was very Japanese. Chinese sword play does not look like Samurai sword play.But the story, though historically off a bit, was well told, the acting was fine and the spectacle was, well, spectacular.It is the first DVD I've seen where actors were not listed.It's not that bad. A good one for a rainy Sunday afternoon."
4,A Traditional Japanese Story,"This is a remarkable independent Japanese movie that was officialy selected to be showed at several independent world film festivals, such as Antalya Golden Orange, Moscow International, and Bangkok. The film is obviously in Japanese, with English subtitles available, and tells the story of Genghis Khan, one of history's greatest rulers, a warrior of a tribe converted to a myth by means of war.At the beginning it took me a while to get into the story, but soon I was hooked up by the epic proportions of the drama and at the end I enjoyed the movie very much. The budget for this kind of movies is low, so don't expect the effects of LOTR, or the battle sequences found in Braveheart, although the DRAMA within the movie remains pristine. The acting is quite remarkable and the costume design is outstanding.Recommended for independent film lovers and excellent for those learning Japanese :-)"
3,"Mixture of fact, myth, and fiction.","The life is Genghis Khan not well known. We have tons of information about him but much of it is myth or propaganda created by the Mongols. Some of the events - like the killing of one of his own brothers - seems to have happened but the event was changed slightly. According to legend Khan was attacking from the back! Khan's life WAS very tough - he learned a lot about survival and tactics while being hunted down by other more powerful men. He also learned that merit and trust were more important than blood. To me, the movie seemed to end right when things were becoming interesting.Watch it, enjoy it, take it with a pinch of salt. I would suggest gettingGenghis Khan and the Making of the Modern Worldfor some serious research into his life."
3,it was ok but,it was ok but if you want to see a great Genshis Khan movie i suggest you get Mongol that movie is as close as it gets to the truth of the great Khan
3,Interesting if Long,"Genghis Khan this is a really long dramtic piece that spends a lot of time in deep long shots and exposition. At times it seems to be rather ""talkie"" but the cinematic appraoch and the long broad shots are very interesting. Except for its length - there is a lot of meat here. It's just that it takes 20 minutes of redorick to get to the good stuff. Visually it is nice and interesting to look at. The action seems real if again a little long and drawn out. The performances are intense and dramtic and boarding on the ""soapy"" side. Good detail however. There was alot about this legendary figure I did not know. And if made me do a little research on my own. Accurate and intense with a lot of action. I think it will be enjoyed by the adults who don't mind the length - however kids may get a little antsie about it. I suggest watching it in segments - it will be absorbed better. 10-08 - Lorenzo"
3,decent at best!,"I've wanted to see this film for a while, I remeber when had first come out and didn't get good reviews at all. I always like historical movies and I never really learned all that much about Genghis Khan.From my perspective the film suffered from the English subtitles. There are parts of it that grab the viewer's attention making it a pain in the butt to read the subtitles at the same time. Some movies are able to pull it off but not this one. You have the option of english dubbing but the quality wasn't there. Gives it a bit of a generic feel.All together this film is a 3 at most. The subtitling wasn't the only thing that dropped the rating for me. I don't think the acting was up to par for the kind of movie that it really should have been."
3,3 Stars - Genghis Khan,"After 25 plus years in the making this movie was painfully slow in places. This kind of movie is really not my cup of tea, really doesn't tell the whole story and shows a somewhat biased version and writer's vision of who Khan really was. On the plus side - the landscapes were beautiful..."
3,"So pretty, but not much else...","The cinematography, costumes, and technical elements are outstanding, but they cannot hide a mediocre script with more plot holes than a slice of Swiss Cheese. The vista's of Mongolia (the movie was shot on location) are breathtaking, esp. on Blu-ray. I would recommend renting the movie, but cannot recommend buying it.For the home theater buffs: I watched this on my PS3 with using the default, lossless, soundtrack with a very good 5.1 all Polk setup, and a 61"" Samsung LED DLP set. The transfer is good, and the sound is solid, but not great. The color balance is true and vibrant, making a fine evenings viewing - but one viewing is definitely enough."
4,A great epic,"Beautifully photographed and scored, this epic film retells the story of Genghis Khan. The PANAVISION location photography is breathtaking. The cast is fantastic, and the story involving. The 2.35:1 ANAMORPHIC DVD transfer is very sharp and colorful, and there are both Japanese and English soundtracks for those who prefer not to read subtitles and visually enjoy every frame of this exciting film."
1,Mongol is better...,Stick to the Mongol if you want a better movie. Story didn't make sense and too dramatic for my taste.
3,Regrets,"Having previously viewed MONGOL, directed by Sergei Bodrov, Genghis Khan, To the Ends of the Earth and Sea, was a pale reflection of the intrinsic power of the place and the man portrayed in MONGOL. Much of Genghis Khan seemed to be staged and artifical, without regard for the power of cinema to transport us to a different time and place. The camera seemed to be an observer of events and not part of them. By the end of the movie, there was regret that MONGOL had not been expanded to include this part of Genghis Khan's life. That would have been a fascinating movie to watch."
3,Not Bad.,"Several years ago I saw a foreign film on Genghis Khan that I thought was just spectacular. I saw it in a theater and cannot for the life of me remember the somewhat unusual title. All I know is that it was not this film, which is quite beautiful in terms of its cinematography and other technical elements, but just isn't as compelling a story. I also get a bit nervous about recommending historical films of this type because they often take great liberties with the truth (which I know can be a common problem in film). So, I will give GENGHIS KHAN a guarded recommendation based on the very competent way in which it tells its story and the lavish visual landscape against which it is told."
4,Energetic,"What an energetic first album! From jazz to funk to rap, and all the soundbits in-between, it appreciates many ""styles"" of music. I didn't want it to end. I hope the hidden track is a taste of more to come! I recommend it to all who love to move and groove!"
5,A welcome addition to Native American art studies shelves.,"Winner of the Twitchell History Award among other honors, Saints of the Pueblos is a wonderful testimony to the influence that the images of saints have upon Pueblo pottery traditions - a unique melding of Hispanic and Pueblo cultures. Each of the nineteen active pueblos is represented with a retablo as created by author Charlie Carrillo of its patron saint, in the style of the pueblo. Four additional, ancestral pueblos are also represented. The colorful imagery, interspersed with black-and-white photography and thoughtful text about the history of each pueblo and its art makes Saints of the Pueblos a distinguished, viscerally visual exploration of how Catholicism and Pueblo culture are inextricably interwoven. A welcome addition to Native American art studies shelves."
1,poor book,"It is a very expensive book. It lacks the explanations of very good books like Factors of Soil Formation by Hans Jenny and Fluvial Processes in Geomorphology by Leopold and Wolman, which are excellent books and the prices are not so high. As a scientist I would not recommend the book to the students or the professionals."
2,Don't like it,Work outs are not that great. The ape disrupts the flow of the workouts in each episode. My least favorits of the Gilad series
2,Expensive walkie talkie NOT anything like a cell phone!!,"I am VERY disappointed with this toy. The box hypes it up to be just like a cell phone going so far as to say ""no fees no bills"" but it is just a glorified walkie talkie. A button has to be pushed on the side, just like a walkie talkie, to talk. The only thing that sets this apart from a walkie talkie is it takes ""pictures"". It is hardly worth the extra price though considering the pictures are barely recognizable.The only good thing is that if the children's friends have the same toy, they can add their code to the list and ""call"" them. All this means is they get a ring to pick up their walkie talkie.Bottom line, this company shouldn't push this toy as being like a cell phone because it is not. It is a walkie talkie."
1,a cheap imitation,This is just a cheap imitation of a regular cell phone.If you really want a phone don't get one with poor pictures that are in black and white or something that is totally rediculous.You're are better off with a regular cell phone with a color camera.Besides it's a waste of money to buy a kids toy while all of your other friends have real cell phones with real cameras with clear pictures and good sound.
1,HA!HA!HA!,"This is probably the dumbest toy i've ever seen since the bratz babyz chill out lounge(which didn't work).You can only call up to a two mile range.PUH-LEASE!Your better off getting a regular cell phone.Besides the pictures are so dark you can't even see it.Like I said before with the two mile range, suppose your out of town,can you can anyone,NO!,because it would be long distance.I wouldn't buy this phone.I think it is a complete waste of time and money."
1,great at first...,"I purchased this opener about eight months ago, and like the others who wrote reviews I was thrilled with the quality... skip forward eight months and... well it just wears out, it won't cut through a single can. I've never had a can opener wear out so fast."
3,BEWARE: TWO DIFFERENT GRADES OF THIS PRODUCT!,"It has come to my attention that there are TWO series of Kitchen Aid Accessories...the cooks series & the proseries...even thought they look very similar, they ARE NOT. The pro series is sturdy & works well...the cook series is little more than a pricy toy that does not work.I did contact Kitchen Aid & they sent me a replacement in the Pro series...I appreciate that.Below is my original review @ 1 star:After owning a Kitchen Aid manual can opener that I have used for many years, I decided to buy the pink one and another one for a family member. What a disappointment. The new ones are useless. They will barely even open a can. Kitchen Aid has DOWNGRADED the quality of this item...I wrote to the company & they are sending me a replacement...of course I'm sure it will be no better. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM."
5,"it's pink! sturdy, too.","i adore pink, and am slowly filling my house with it, starting in my kitchen with those things i need most. this can opener replaced my cheap, uncomfortable, flimsy one & is an absolute dream."
1,Not the group from Epcot,"This is not what I was looking for you should find the CD for the Nova Era from Epcot, they were the best players of modern classic music for our genaration!"
3,WRONG VERSION,"I thought this was a 2009 version and it turn out to be 2003, not very useful. If you have a 2009 version, I'll by it."
2,Rand McNally,The description said NEW. Maybe it was new but it was an old version and was very poor at that. Much prefer my old version of Street Atlas or Mapquest.
4,Sounds real good,"I'ma fan of progressive rock- Yes, Rennaissance, King Crimson, ELP, ETC. Listened to clips of this one and got me hooked. I would say if you are fan of other progressive rock bands, you'll probabaly like this too."
4,Last of original lineup.,"This is the last of four recordings made by Camel's original and finest lineup. Following this recording they made three strong albums with Richard Sinclair, of Caravan fame, as the replacement bassist. The first four discs were different than the next three in that there was more room for instrumental interplay. The chemistry between these four musicians made for some inspired and enjoyable music. The only flaw can be found in the vocals as Camel never really developed a strong vocal presence. Still in spite of this singular flaw Camel's early recordings are well worth obtaining. This record, Moonmadness, has some of Latimer's finest and most passionate soloing. Highly recommended...Simon"
1,What a let down...,"..just a let down since the first two movies where whimsical and fun.. and in Live Action.Nope, didn't like it one bit."
4,Very pleased,I loved the product. It was in good shape and i received it quickly. i qould definately recommend shopping on Amazon.com over ebay any day. Amazon has much better deals and availability.
5,Excellent Service,Thank you for sending this is the most timely manner. My grandkids are enjoying this.
2,a cartoon,"nothing near the quality of the first two stuart little movies and not enough to keep the little one's attention long enough to enjoy it...the storyline is good, but it failed to hit the pre-schoolers level of excitement like the first two movies did. they were bored within minutes of the movie starting.."
5,Crisp,"I have listened to many collections of symphonies, waiting for a decent recording. This is one of the best I have heard. The recording feels crisp and modern. Too many recordings sound like there are socks over the microphones or they are recorded from another room. This one sounds full, close, and modern. Excellent job!"
5,Whisper of Death,"Quite simply, this is the most amazing book I've EVER read. It had everything a horror fan could ever want. Definitely a must read. The characters are described so carefully and with great detail. I'm speechless. You've just GOT to read this book for yourself."
5,Christopher Pike's intriguing mystery thriller.,"Christopher Pike's Whisper of Death was the scariest book I've personally ever read. Not only that, but unlike other horror books churned out at an impossibly reeling pace by one author, this book proves itself to be intelligent, beguiling, and EXTREMELEY scary. Also, the storyline is fresh and original. I am not at all a usual reader of horror, but you big time horror fans will immediatley recognize how free of cliche's is this story. You won't be able to put it down!"
5,Great book,I read this when I was in middle school and absolutely loved it. I admit I was a little young for the mature subject matter but he wrote it brilliantly. It has been stuck in my head to this day and I am actually buying it to read again.I would recommend this book.
5,Very weird and creepy,"This book was one of the strangest books I have ever read, and I loved it. I mean the story was so cool and the characters were almost alive (well for most of the book). I mean it also takes a stab and bringing something new into a story. This book has a really big issue in it that is facing alot of teens today... abortion. I am glad that Mr. Pike is not afraid to pull all the punches and treat his readers as mature people. This book was very creepy with great characters that I wish could have been in more books. A MUST!!!!"
5,"If you've never read Pike, READ THIS BOOK FIRST!!","I've read everything by Christopher Pike I've ever been able to get my hands on. If you've never read anything by him, try this one first. The characters are very real. I compared myself to all of them at different times. I've read Wisper of Death twice, like most of his books, but I could read it over and over again and understand it a little more each time. It gets very deep and it has some hidden morals that you might not see on the surface. You won't be able to put it down until you're done. Then you'll want to pick it up again. A message to people who haven't read any of Pike's books: Read all the old stuff first. Books like Remember Me (my favorite), Witch, Wisper of Death, and Scavenger Hunt show Pike at his absolute best."
4,Creepy,"For a teenage potboiler, this bbok is rather creepy. Five teenagers inexplicably find themselves in a dead, abandoned world; the only common thread linking them is their connection to a dead girl. They soon find themselves being killed off in ways so imaginatively gruseome as to be worthy of an Italian horor film. The only drawback is the out-of-date moralizing: Roxanne had an abortion, so she must die! Otherwise highly entertaining."
5,Creepy,"My favorite story by this author, and it's extremely creepy. It takes a lot to creep me out. A short read but very original and exciting, read it all in one sitting!"
5,THE BEST C.P I'VE READ,i loved this book so much it's so scary well the idea and it was so well written i love christopher pike books this IS his bestYOU HAVE GOT TO THIS IT IS SOO GOOD!
4,Classic Pike...if even a bit preachy,"This is a really good one of his; I read this when I was maybe 12 and I think I read it at least five or six times throughout junior high. The only thing I dislike about it--and some other reviewers pointed this out as well--is that it borders on preachy with the abortion theme. Pike is very good with writing teenage girls, in fact his best books are written from the female perspective IMO. But this is a topic that he really has no idea about, and it shows. Other than that, though, I loved it."
5,Ode to Mr. Pike,"I adore Christopher Pike. Adore him like I adore Keanu Reeves. This book made me shudder, think, and become a fiction writer. What if it did happen? What if you were trapped in someone's world with them playing with you? Christopher Pike explores this with depth, emotion, and searing pain, making it number one on my top ten Pike List. Up there with it is Sati, Master of Murder, the Last Vampire series, See You Later, Witch, Remember Me, and Fall into Darkness. All of the others are just as good. Pike rarely hits a sour note. I read his books over and over again, ever since I was about 13. I'm 22 now and I advise you, if you love suspense, sci-fi, deep characters, mystery, and Vampires, start in on his books. Even if you're past the suggested reading level!"
3,interesting storyline...,"okay, i was honestly rather surprised at the sexual basis of this whole book. i wasnt really expecting it from a young adult genre book. still, it was an interesting read. i deduced the relative ending early on in the story, so i wasnt suprised by the ending. this certainly is not one i'd consider to be the better of pike's work, but it's still good. if you like twisted stories, and don't have issues with teen sexuality or abortion, then this would possibly be of interest to you."
5,A dead world,"Going back to their hometown, Rox and her boyfriend Pepper find the world empty. They find this out by calling people and getting no answers. They meet three other kids. Nerdy Stan, Leslie the beauty and Helter the jerk. They soon realize that they are all related to Betty Sue, the smart and brilliant girl who killed herself weeks ago."
3,"interesting, but poorly recorded","I'm not quite sure which is the greater issue: the murky sound quality and low recording level, inaccurate playing, or some simply messy countrapuntal writing. This recording suffers from the same lack of clarity that the Arte Nova issue of Furtwangler's 2nd symphony suffers from. When compared the Chicago Symphony version of Furtwangler's 2nd, It was clear that the orchestra was the problem in the Arte Nova release, not Furtwangler's writing. In this case, it's likely it's a combination of all three. The orchestra seems like it's trying to smear over flubbed notes, and the compressed sounding recording makes detail impossible to make out. This is a very interesting symphony and I'll certainly give the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd a shot, but the performance and recording make it hard to really get an impression of how good this symphony actually is. Hopefully the recordings of the 1st and 4th on Naxos are of better quality."
3,Not Brian at his best!,"I have a lot of time for the music of Havergal Brian, but I don't recommend this recording as a way in.The first two movements sound like an incoherent mess as if little attention or care has been taken over them. The last two movements are truly imaginative and powerful enough to carry the work through, but you would be better off starting with the excellent recording of the 3rd."
1,Sixguns & Bullseyes/Reichenbach,"Most poorly done reprint I've ever purchased. The publisher alibis some of the mess in the forward. None of the illustrations are reproduced. LOTS of punctuation mistakes. Ends up being to big an aggravation to suffer through for the subject matter. I'll not buy from this publisher, again.Sid Longwell"
2,Please enter a title for your review,"The trailer tricked me into watching this. For the first half hour it was pretty cool, like how she falls into the hole with the bike and then just lies there having a conversation with the dude, but after that all personality, flavor, and attention to detail disappears leaving all characters and situations one-dimensional. Most scenes in the romantic plotline lack context and feel like re-enecatments from other movies. They actually use the ""romantic lead 1 sees romantic lead 2 hugging someone out of context and jumps to the wrong conclusion"" thing. The rest is like an episode of Ugly Betty with all the office scheming drama. A made-for-tv calibre product, or maybe it should more accurately just be considered a kids movie."
5,Jessica's Blonde Ambition,"I thougtht this movie was pretty funny. Jessica def. shows that she can be a really good actress from this movie. It shows that she can play a serious roll, a funny, blonde ditzy roll and everything.Jessica Def. did a good time and i would recommend it to anymore who wants to see a good funny movie."
1,what in the..?,"I do not know what exactly I was thinking when I bought this. I thought maybe Luke Wilson or Rachael Leigh Cook would make this worthwhile. I was wrong. Jessica Simpson is the worst actress I have ever been unfortunate enough to watch. The movie tries really hard to be funny, but it just isn't. It's kind of sad. It makes me kind of sad knowing I spent almost 25 dollars on this. Don't waste your money. If you REALLY want to watch Jessica Simpson be unfunny and untalented, go rent Newlyweds on DVD."
5,A great history of the Civil War,Part 2 of Bruce Catton's fantastic trilogy of the Civil War is an interesting look at the road to Gettysburg through the eyes of the army of the Potomac. By the end of this book the army is ready to go and win under a new commander but you can see how the politics involved have worn down the morale of the army. It is very well written using historical accounts and while newer works have added more and disproved some of Catton's conclusions it is still one of the best books on the civil war.
2,bland uninspired generic by LeTigre's standards,"The first S/T album is an all-time classic. I still listen to it all the time. Femmist Sweepstakes rocks too! This album just seems uninspired to me. The production is generic stick the beats up front new wave dance. The vocals are weak. I never in my life thought I would say that about Kate Hanna. The songs are weak and generic. What the heck happened here?! I still love Le Tigre, and would see them in concert again, but I can't recommend this album to someone as a first Le Tigre buy. Get the first two first, then prepare yourself to be disappointed with this one."
3,good but not great,"There are about 4 really solid songs on the album. I expect more out of Le Tigre so it was a huge letdown that the album is mostly filler. It seems like they'll never recapture the spark of their first album but it's a little unfair to compare this to their debut since it's such an essential ""must have"". A bump in the road in my opinion but don't lose the faith because Le Tigre's just getting warmed up."
4,"not as good as previous albums, but good nonetheless","when i first got this cd i was extremely dissapointed, and i think a lot of other people will be too if they expect to hear the same sound they heard on previous le tigre records like i did. the music doesn't have the same lo-fi, diy sound that the other records did, and kathleen doesn't seem to be screaming with as much fury and rage as she did on other albums. but, after several repeated listenings (and seeing them live, which was great), the album actually kind of grew on me. i still don't like all of the songs (some of them are just boring to me, yes, boring) but if you're willing to accept a change in the overall sound of le tigre, then i think you might be able to actually come to like ""this island"" for the most part."
1,Shamelessly stupid,"""TKO"" is ghastly awful, but at least its title has a shred of truth: it is so unbearably tacky that it very well might make one feel smacking whomever allowed the album to be played in a civilized room. The band seems to fancy itself as some sort of ""hip"" underground thing, but they are really only an embarassing goofy 21st-century lesbian answer to The Village People.If the mere gimmick of featuring one of the women band members sporting a pubescent mustache and a tuxedo is the only means the band can dig up to be ""shocking,"" ""outrageous,"" or ""cute,"" then you know it reveals a desperate and shamelessly stupid lack of talent. Why does anyone listen to this audio equivalent of diarrhea when there are so many infinitely better bands out there? Who ever actually listens to this and likes it is living their own punishment!"
2,An Enormous Disappointment: Bland and Forgettable,"I was introduced to Le Tigre in May, when I saw them play at a music festival. I loved their energy, wit and originality, and I bought all of their music the following week. I was hooked.I was really excited for this album, even though I heard bad things about it. Everything I heard was true. It is so bland and uninteresting that it made me want to cry. The lyrics aren't witty or interesting or anything, and the music is really boring. ""Tell You Now"" is ok, but nowhere NEAR as good as the songs on their other albums. I really hope that their next album will be more on the right track, but I don't think that will happen."
3,This Island,"Signed with Universal Records, LeTigre is back with a smashing album titled ""This Island"". 13 tracks that are very versatile, very spunky, very early 90's pop-rock. The cover seems like a theme for sixteen candles and that sparked my attention much more. This is not always my cup of tea, but I can't help but to continue in listening to them....there music is upbeat!!! LeTigre is worth the buy and worth the listen...check em' out!!!"
5,Who'se into radical feminist karaoke????,"I'll start by saying this: Pay no mind to ""New Kicks"" (the first single off of This Island), rather look at it as a whole album, then everything will make a lot more sense.This is easily Le Tigre's most accessable release to date, yet still manages to mix their daring sense of style and fashion and feminist/anti-war/dance politics. It seems le tigre has hit their stride and finally found their niche as a matured group of songwriters.I'd make an attempt to define the best tracks, but really there isn't anything I'd say is sub-par. So, all around I'd say it's just a damn good buy."
1,uninspired,If this was a truly good album then no one would even mention the old Le Tigre albums. It is a shame to move on and produce a piece of work that is so dull and uninspired. As a fan I'm afraid that is how I feel. The whole album feels as though it took a couple of days to loosely stitch together without much vision and I found it quite embarrasing in places. I've tried really hard to get into it but there is not one song on here that I like. It's a crying shame.
5,An enjoyable movie for everyone.,My husband and I took our 3 children ages 4-8 to see this movie at the theater. We usally wait until the video comes out because even in kids movie's these days you can't be to sure of the language that might come out. This was a great movie and we knew it would be because the cartoon is the BEST one on T.V. All movies should be this enjoyable!
5,A fun adventure movie for children,"My four-year-old daughter loves this movie. When I returned the rented version to the video store, she was so disappointed that I've decided to buy the video. I rarely buy videos, but I think this will be one of those movies that she'll want to watch again and again. (She watched it four times while we had it from the video store.) I highly recommend this movie."
3,Boarding-school japes in France!,"It is heartening to know that people are still making films of this type. This is in the style of Happiest Days Of Their Lives or the St.Trinians films, but with younger girls. It therefore ditches any sort of sexuality in favour of a rather charming innocence. Even the teacher is a nun, rather than an Alistair Sim type. Having said that, these girls are no Von-Trapp angels. Director Daisy Von Scherler Meyer avoids the pitfall of casting precocious showbiz children and choses (mainly) sweet little girls who can act. The main plot about the girls trying to keep their school from being sold by crusty old aristocrat Nigel Hawthorne is spiced up with a kidnap caper which stops things wearing thin. On the whole, a good one to watch with younger children."
5,Fun movie.,Bought it for the grandkids to see but we love it too. A good movie for the whole family. There aren't very many movies out now that I would want to show to my little kids.
5,Madeline is delightful!,This is a wonderful movie! True to the books with scenary that puts you right in Paris. Definitely a family favorite for many years.
4,decent retelling of the classic series,"While the movie isn't exactly the same as the book (what movie is?) the film was overall faithful to the spirit of the book, and the girl who plays Madeline did a nice job in her part. I also liked Ms. Clavel. The storyline is engaging, and if you liked the books, then this movie should please you, since it is written rather well with a believable story."
4,a great film after about fifteen minutes,"I'm not a seven year old girl, so it's fair to say I'm probably not the target audience- but the wife is an elementary school librarian, so occasionally I find myself watching a movie I don't believe I'd pick out for myself.That said, I enjoyed this movie. The first fifteen minutes were a bit hard to watch- this is a live action movie that needs to connect with illustrated classic it was made from - so we get the classic lines from the classic books, which verges on chringe-worthy when Madeline says Pooh-Pooh to the tiger in the zoo.Once the homage to the book is made, the movie does much better. Frances McDormand makes a wonderful Miss Clavel, Pepito is spot on, and Madeline is quite good.The hijinks and high spirited goofs are good, and the adventure that caps the movie is, on the main, believable.Worth watching-"
5,Fits like a glove!,"Another great Naturalizer shoe! True to size, comfortable and good looking -- great buy!"
3,"Biased, but with some facts","This book is mostly an account by Kurt Lohbeck on his journeys to Afghanistan. Unfortunatly, most of it seems to be biased, in favor of himself, and his favorite muj, the late Abdul Haq.Undoubtly, Kurt had some great experiences over there, but it seems too immpressive to be real. Kurt seems to show up during every major event in the 80's, as well as meet every key figure from Reagan all the way down.The Afghan, Abdul Haq, he paints as a superhero - who single-handedly defeated the Soviets. When Kurt's accounts are compared to others who were there (Check ""The Bear Trap"", and ""Soldiers of God""), there are discrepencies. On the plus side, Abdul Haq was a major player in the war, and this book gives more detailed information about him, then anywhere else.On general matters Afghani, there are better books. But as a biography on Abdul Haq, then this book has excellent information."
1,"Oh, look! More pictures of Kurt!","The factual errors start in the very first sentence of the forward by Dan Rather and continue throughout. Lohbeck even gets the definition of ""Islam"" wrong; he says it means ""peace"". There are plenty of pictures of Kurt for those inclined to look at them."
3,"Good for ticks, but not much else","I experimented with permethrin coating of my outdoor clothes recently and my findings are that while it is useful for preventing ticks from advancing on your clothes, its of little value with all other insects, especially mosquitoes who will bite through your clothes before the permethrin has a chance to kill them. Remember, this is not a repellent, but a insecticide. So if the insect stays on the clothes long enough to absorb the permethrin, it will die and fall off. This is the case with ticks but not with most flying insects. In addition to its limitations, this product is really expensive. I can only get one or two uses out of one can of spray and the longevity of the effect is questionable beyond 2 weeks of application. See the reviews of insect repellents in a recent issue of Backpacker magazine (summer 07)."
4,As expected,Fast delivery and product arrived as described on the website. Highly recommended for this product. Personally I am not sure how it performs as it is for a relative.
1,Dangerous product if it gets on your skin,"REPEL Mosquito Stop Clothing & Gear Insect Repellent: Be very careful with this product. Don't spray it on your shoes while you are wearing the shoes for example. The active agents will leak though sneakers and socks and cause a TERRIBLE reactions. rash and blisters, terrible pain for over one week after use the product on my sneakers."
1,Generally Useless and a Waste of Money,"I have both Haynes Fiero manual (1999 edition) and Chilton Fiero manual. Except for detail differences, both are the same and both are nearly useless as they lack any sort of detailed information or instructions. Information on headlight motor repair or replacement? Nope. Information that the troublesome ""Gen1"" headlight motors were replaced with much more reliable ""Gen2"" motors and controllers for 1987/88? Nope. How about the totally revised REAR suspension for 1988? Nope. But, and get this, ""All 1988 models are equipped with a redesigned FRONT suspension system."" The changes to the rear suspension for 1988 were far more drastic than the changes to the front suspension, but neither manual addresses these changes. How about information on the taillights? Nothing. Zero. Nada. Want to work on a Fiero? Go online and search for a ""how to"" for what you want to do and don't waste your money or time on either of these ... publications."
4,Excellent historical account of Yugoslavia's civil wars.,"My wife and I went on a guided tour of parts of this region in March, which included Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro, and Slovenia. During the tour, our guide gave us a brief history of Yugoslavia from its creation through the civil wars. He recommended this book for an in-depth study of the causes behind the civil wars. This book followed a 6-part BBC documentary series, which was first broadcast in 1995.It goes into great detail to describe the various leaders and their involvement in the events leading up to the civil wars and all the way through them, up to the official end of the hostilities (the Dayton Accords). The extent and description of all the atrocities aren't described in detail, but there are plenty of other sources for that (starting with Wikipedia).The book could use another volume, as what happened later in Kosovo was pretty much the same as what happened in Bosnia-Herzegovina, although on a lesser scale."
5,Same Sex Unions In Premodern Europe,"Solid historic research that is as fresh today as it was 16 years ago when it was published. Any one who wants to speak about Gay marriage either for or against should have to read this. Boswell was one of the premier historians of his generation before his untimely death. That there has been no one who has shown any realistic opposing view show how well his research was, though there has been additional research on newly found early Christian Gay marriage since then. Must read."
5,Wonderful Scholarship,"I couldn't disagree more with claims that this book is dry. As a student planning to become a historian focusing on homosexual history (one that is interested in the pre-1869 ""gay identities"" that social constructionists like to downplay), I thought this book was insightful, interesting, and an easy read. The field of gay history needs more scholars like the late Boswell."
3,Great thesis wrong approach,"This book had some interesting things to say but it went about it in the wrong way. First of all, I think this book demonstrates that marriage is more then superficial ceremonies and the exchanging of rings. I found it a great expose' on how same sex unions can be just as affective as heterosexual ones. ... The problem with this book is that its just so dry. The ton of footnotes make it a chore to read and a couple of chapters could be left out altogether. I would love to listen to an abridged version of this book on CD. It would be more interesting and probably would get Boswell's argument across to the lay reader more efficiently. I manage to get through most of it but I got tired in the end. It was like he kept repeating the same points over and over again. A more simplified version would be welcomed with all the footnotes in the back well away from the main text. Conclusion, an interesting thesis but not a read for everyone."
3,In search of a word,"This book illustrates the importance of proper words for the proper functioning of society. It also brings to mind the raging modern debate about the word ""marriage:"" Those who want to define it to also mean the sanction of homosexual unions and those who oppose that particular use of the word.Past linguistic history suggests a possible end to this debate (presently in an impasse) by creating a neologism for same-sex unions. I propose, for whatever it is worth, the word ""parriage."" It is remarkably close to ""marriage"" and it strongly suggests pairing. It may well satisfy those who seek social change without antagonizing the feelings of those who want to continue to use the word ""marriage"" in its traditional sense. After all, while the past has certainly a claim on the present and even the future, it cannot prevent social progress."
5,Fabulous Precision,"The issue with all texts on Chinese medicine in English is translation. Given his penchant for ridiculously arcane terminology, Wiseman is no different. The outstanding feature of this dictionary and other Wiseman works, however, is the marriage of translation to Chinese, meaning one can examine his interpretation against the actual text. Pinyin is an obviously helpful bridge to understanding Chinese, but seeing the actual characters adds much to the understanding of TCM theory and application.Such careful scholarship is worthy of acclaim."
3,Nothing special socks,"The price was right, but the socks are kind of chinchy. The foot fabric is okay, but the upper fabric is rather thin and short in length."
2,Quality has declined.,"My household has been wearing these for years. (That's the only reason I felt comfortable buying them over the internet without trying them on, first; we have always loved these socks.)BUT the packs I just received are thinner and feel cheaper and less cushiony than the ones we've bought in the past. When pulling the sock on it feels like my fingers might poke a hole through the fabric.I might even suspect that these were ""fake"" Hanes, but I don't know anything about product counterfeiting, so I won't actually make that accusation.In any case these socks do not feel as comfortable and I suspect they will not be anywhere near as durable as I'm used to.I gave the product two stars because at least the socks fit my feet!"
5,Thick socks,"I am bad about going shoe-less all the time, so I need a really thick sock. These feel like they'll be around awhile, and without holes in them. Great price for a good sock."
4,Good quality,I like these socks. I love the length of the crew sock (I use it for sleeping) and feels good. My only complaint would be that the stretchy crew part is a bit tight. I think it's probably tighter to me than others because I am sensitive to pressure on my skin someimes. I hope this makes sense. :p
4,Read Before Touring Laurel Plantation,We toured Laurel Plantation in Louisiana a few days ago and this book was offered for sale in the gift shop. Reference was made to the book many times during the tour. It is a set of writings by one of the family members who lived at the plantation. Suggest you purchase the book if you pan on a trip to the plantation however buy it through Amazon. Got mine for $7.95 compared to the $22.00 cost at the gift shop.
4,Perfect condition,Interesting journal and historical facts about life on and around the plantation. Told as a story about the day to day lives during that time.
4,Phillies Shirt,"I bought this, at the last minute, for my husband's Christmas present and I was worried that it wouldn't get here in time, but it came faster than I expected and he loved it!"
5,Stalking Justice,"Greetings,As an avid reader of true crime books this one rates really high on my list. I loved every minute of it as the book was well written and really held your attention. Once I started reading I could not put it down. I liked it because the author told the entire story without adding endless pages of scientific termonology that would go over the average reader's head. I would recommend this book to anyone who is fascinated with the criminal mind."
1,TI is wack.........,"Damn, I thought TI would definately come with some hard stuff with all the anticipation of this album but all in all, this album is straight garbage........Young Buck kills the whole cd with his verse on Undertaker and the only other good tracks are #1, #2, and #10. Don't even go support this huuurrrting cd.....download it off the internet just to get another killer Young Buck verse!"
4,"Good cd, could have been a little better","Don't get me wrong this album was HOTT but I expected a little better. Needs more ""street"" songs on here there are too many ""chill"" songs. Album is still very nice though.Top Tracks:King BackFront BackI'm Talkin' To YouUndertakerBankheadmyspace.com/getthebloodmoney"
5,AWSOME!!!!!,the combination of rhyme and beat makes T.I. a true authentic southern rapper. T.I. is gonna have a very successful career you can bet your money on that.
5,T.I. is back and better than ever.,"Who would have thought that TI could make an LP this sick. One song that shows his lyrical side is I'm Talkin To You, where he speeds up his flow to match Just Blaze's busy production. One of the coolest songs on KING is ""Told You So"", dedicated to everyone who didn't believe in him, including former boss LA Reid (""If LA only knew how wrong he could be/I told ya ain't nobody stronger than me""). Spoken like a true king.Top 5:I'm Talkin To YouBankhead f/ P$C and Young DroHello f/ GovernorGet ItTold You So"
4,"Not 5 stars, but definately a Classic","Dis one of TI best albums to drop. This aint got the street knock like Im serious, but still hold everything in place. He proved he a lyricist and not just a rapper about 2 albums ago. This just put the seal of approval on it. Gotta get it"
4,Best T.I. Yet!!!,"This has easily passed urban legend on so many levels,King Of Tha South Iz Back!!Best Songs:Ride Wit MeI'm Talking To YouWhy You WannaTop BackUndertaker F/Young Buck, Young Dro"
5,wow...,"T.I. has finally perfected his formula and made the classic album that everybody knew he had in him. I'm Serious came out in 2001 and that cd was decent. Then came Trap Musik in 2003 followed by Urban Legend and both of those cds were excellent. However, lyrically and production wise, King exceeds everything he has ever done. The lyrics are on point throughout the whole album and every song has a bangin beat. What You Know, the first single, is the slow victory lap that is reminiscent of Bring Em Out. Live In The Sky, Undertaker, Good Life, Stand Up Guy, and Talkin To You are all excellent highlights that make this album easily worth the purchase.If you haven't already, go out and buy King, Urban Legend, and Trap Musik, the best musical moments of TIP's career. Also buy Fishscale by Ghostface Killah and Blue Collar by Rhymefest."
3,T.I. [King],"T.I.'s return with his fourth album King was highly anticipated after a few nominations Of Urban Legend. Well after listening to ""King"" I don't agree it's better than ""Urban Legend"". First of all I think he went some unexpected producers like Just Blaze,Neptunes and Swizz Beatz. Although he had sucess with all in the past except Just Blaze, the beats were not tailor made for him. I think he could've came harder than Urban Legend but that's just me. I guess the country might disagree because he sold 522,000 copies the first week.The best tracks are:01. ""King Back"" [producer:Just Blaze]02. ""Front Back"" [feat.UGK]03. ""What You Know""04. ""I'm Talkin' To You"" [producer:Just Blaze]06. ""Ride Wit Me"""
3,Its Alright,"Its good dont get me wrong, but i personally felt he could of did better. In my book Scarface,Ugk and Dj Screw r the Kings of the South. He jus the King of ATL nnd GA."
3,3.5 stars - Can you say one hit record?,"What you know about that is hands down the best track on this record, and it gets my vote for best rap song of the year. None of the other songs on this joint is of the same caliber. TI's strengths are best utilized when he's kicking that wise OG game.Other Songs worth mentioningTold you soGood LifeWhy you wannaBankhead"
2,"Baby, What Happened?","Now TI is my husband and everything but I must say my boyfriend and I were very dissapointed when we went to Circuit City and PURCHASED his CD. Aside from the 4 singles already released the album is garbage and thats sad with there being 18 tracks. He should've put a free movie ticket in there, maybe i wouldnt have felt so insulted.It sounds extremely rushed which doesnt make since when Urban Legend was released 11/04. The best track on the CD was the skit with Mike Epps. I still love you though baby better luck next time boo. To be fair I gave the whole CD six listens before my final judgement."
2,it's aight,"i like the beats on here&the Production is cool,but TI is missing something from living up to the status that he has procalimed himself to being. I like his flow,but He ain't no King of the South.give me Scarface anyday from down South.this Disc got some bangers that are tight in the WHip,but there is more hype at this time than actual substance."
1,KING OF WACK (O STAR),"NO SKILLS .CAN T RHYME ,WEAK LYRICS,WEAK FLOW,BAD SONGSYOU A KING ,BUT OF WACK AND PEOPLE WHO DON T THINKVERY WEAK ALBUM, WHEN I THINK IN THE SOUTH THERE IS SOME GREAT MC'S LIKE STRANGE FRUIT AND VERBAL SEED............... ILL MIND AND SYMBOLYC ONE (the art of one mind) ALBUM DESERVE 5 stars and that 's from the south."
4,"Heat, But not Fire","T.I. does a good job with his 4th album ""King"", but it is just not up to par with Urban Legend. The Album has some good tracks but lacks the smooth flow of previous releases. The album does have some highlights, my top 5 are Ride Wit Me, Top Back, Live in the Sky,I'm Talkin to You, and King Back."
1,"ONE OF THE WACKEST, WEAKEST MC'S EVER!!!","king of the south? rofl! what a joke. this dude can barely ryme one word per bar. his lyrics and flow are corny, basic and wack. forget being the king, this cat is straight up azzcrack. one of the worst ""rappers"" on the planet. subject matter is awful and he's got ZERO skills.""move along along along, ya lyrics are cow dung""-krs-one"
2,dissapointing,i have all of ti albums from im serious to urban legend and the king is by far the wackest of them all. hes gone to commercial now. his beats and lyrics arent as raw as his albums in the past. i wont buy his new album but im still a fan.
1,So disappointed...,"From the last two albums I listened to from this artist, it sounded like he was growing as an artist and maturing. But on this album, I hear songs about burying people, shooting people, once again bragging about going to jail...and then the all-time worst song ""I'm Straight"" where T.I. sings ""Give me some cocaine...and I'm straaaaaaaaaaight."" What the hell? This cd is terrible. This is one of the most simple-minded albums I've ever heard...and coming from a cat that I thought was a pretty intelligent guy but made the wrong choices, I'm EXTREMELY disappointed. This man had the audacity to say ""Don't get me wrong/I ain't neva been a fool/Just put off graduating/For a pair of tennis shoes."" Hip-Hop is going down the drain. I wonder how much Common had to be paid to get on this trash.The only good parts were ""Why You Wanna"" with Mike Epps and some lady who were having the most hilarious break up. ""Why You Wanna"" was cool...but the rest of this album...WACK!"
3,Album Just Isn't That Strong,"Well I got the album as soon as it came out, and i'd have to say that it was a dissapointment, Urban Legend was loaded with hot tracks, but it was hard for me to find a hand full on this album, Overall the album is decent but just not what i expected from T.I. Best songs are Live in the Sky, What You Know, Kings Back, and Front Back, really not much other than those."
5,Does what it says...,"I started getting seriously fit in the last 4 months. This involves a personal trainer and working my body to the point I could never do on my own. I have found that after an hour workout, if I soak in a tub with this Elemis for 15 minutes, I AM NOT SORE.... When I don't have time to soak with Elemis, I AM VERY SORE FOR SEVERAL DAYS.Bottom line, when you have extended yourself physicaly, be it gardening, hiking, etc. a 10-15 minute soak afterwards will relieve any muscle pain."
3,Looked more impressive online...,"I'll be honest up front, I'm not much of an expert with jewelry. It looked impressive online, but when we got it I was somewhat disappointed. The latch (or hook, whatever you call it) was a bit difficult to use so it wasn't easy to put on the wrist. Also, the silver loops looked a bit cheesy. My wife states that she thought it was very nice so it could just be me."
2,Disappointed! Didn't get the CD,"I received only half of the product--just the booklet, so how effective can it be without the CD. The information depends on the CD. My fault for not sending it back."
4,"Really three-and-a-half stars out of four, but a movie for the whole family with something for everybody!","This is absolutely the best David Carradinemovie (he's only in about one third of it,though...)in the last five years. All themajor players here, even Black Feather theRaven, samrtest bird in the forrest, arevery good. Great role by bible quotingjudge played to perfection by Peter Jason(he did a great episode of Hawai'i Five-0years ago; I beleive 1971 entitled ""To Killor Be Killed""), only to be upstaged by Car-radine later! Kelley Miles as ProsecutingAttorney for the Government and Robert Casoare outstanding here as well. The videocover art is a bit misleading. The girl onthe cover of this video, though blonde isabout six while adolescent actress AmyWiegert is about 13 in the film. Greatanimal and scenery shots of both Alaskaand Portland where the film was made. Afine effort on a modest budget! Bravo!"
5,buen cd,este cd es muy bueno ademas de que en japon esta teniendomucho exito lastima que en mexico casi nadie la conoce pero que importa las canciones estan muy padres compren el cd no se arrepentiran
3,idk,"I don't know about this I LOVE the song Crawl, but thats it so far. I think its going to take some getting used to, but i should've bought her new one like i was going to."
2,Disappointed,"The first Marion Raven song that I had heard was ""Heads Will Roll"" when I bought the National Lampoon's Rise of Taj soundtrack. I may have a bias because I'm a freak for Nikki Sixx, but I though the song was amazing. I kept thinking ""Wow this song's awesome! She's got a great voice! She's so edgy.""I bought the cd without hearing any of the other tracks. My mistake. I heard the rest of her cd and I didn't hear that edginess that I was excited to hear. Even the song that I was first introduced to sounded different and overly poppy.I was hoping for Alanis Morissette meets Fiona Apple (or better), and I got Avril Lavigne meets Veruca Salt meets Michelle Branch. Talk about a let down."
3,Not Bad...,"I heard ""End Of Me"" on the radio and was pretty much hooked. I was shocked that it was Marion Raven of previous pop-girl group M2M. She obviously is working with the same formula that made Avril Lavigne and Kelly Clarkson big hits. Fortunately, she does manage to pull it off and this is quite a decent album. Just listen to it with an open mind and try not to picture Marion Raven when you're listening to it. Heck, this is one of those albums that I would not want my friends to find out I'm listening to, but seriously...it's a good listen if you want something light and not too serious. Is it original or groundbreaking? Of course not, but an interesting musical choice for Marion Raven, I'm keen to see how well she holds on to it and what else she can conjure up."
4,Back to the roots,"I saw the 'Here I Am' video on TV and it immediately caught my eye. She definitely had a good voice, a great song, looks, and that concept of singer-guitar player I like so much.Well, a little bit of research on the net brought me to her official website, and the 'Break you' video, and that was it. I love that 'I refuse to be a victim' attitude, and this video has it written all over it, as she really seems to enjoy the revenge against her ex, but still, her heart is broken in a way that everyone can relate to.Anyway, some listening to the other tracks of the album told me this was good stuff, though I wouldn't say that all the songs caught my attention. Basically, the good songs are in the beginning of the album, the last ones I could really do without.Still this is exactly the kind of music I've liked as far as I can remember, it's like returning to the roots after widening my taste in music."
1,This raven don't fly.,"I've had the opportunity to see her live and she has an awesome voice that should be heard, but the direction she has chosen to take with this album is beneath her talent. Both the music and lyrics lack any originality and could have been better. If you want to rock out to a below average rock record, I woudn't even recomend it then. It's a shame that she has sold herself out to this garbage and I'm certainly disapointed. I'm not going to bother commenting on the pornagraphic video from this album other than what the heck is she thinking?"
1,What a piece of trash!!,"I could use this item for only a couple of months and then it died on me. I fixed it, and then died again. So I just threw it away. Do not spend your money on this piece of trash!"
2,Calphalon Tri-ply 3 qt. saute,"Do not be seduced by the price of this pan. I guess the old saying ""you get what you pay for,"" is true. The problem I have with this pan is the lid. Water or whatever you are cooking gets trapped in the seal of the glass lid. The only way to get it out is to shake it vigorously and warm the pan on the stove with the lid on. Also so disappointing is the customer service I received from Calphalon. I called immediately after the pan arrived and they cheerfully told me they would send another lid and a sample of cleaner right away. That was more than 3 months ago. Repeated calls to ask what the problem is, always resulted in taking my name and address again, and telling me it would be sent out right away. I also did a test when a friend purchased this pan and had the exact same problem with the lid. It is defective and should be taken off the market."
4,"Nice pan, but is made in China.","As others have noted, this pan is actually lists for $39.99 on the packaging. I can say that I have seen the pan for the full $130 at other sites. It is, however, made in China and if you would actually pay $130 for it, you should be flogged for not buying All-Clad. That aside, having picked it up when it was on sale for even less than its low list price, I am hapy with it. It heats up nicely and is easily controlled but it has discolored a bit for me. For the money I paid, I am very happy with it. If you think you are getting an awesome deal on a $130 pan, look elsewhere."
4,nice pan,"This pan does the job. I changed from heavy cast aluminum to stainless a couple of years ago because I wanted cookware that is dishwasher safe. Yes, sometimes there is a film inside the pan when it comes out of the wash cycle, but it cleans up easily with Bon Ami. No biggie. The big mess was handled in the dishwasher.I have Emerilware that I really like, but the 3 qt. saute pan was too heavy for me. This Triply pan is just fine for the price and anyone would be crazy to complain about its performance. And if you position the lid on its side and stick the corner of a towel into the rim, it will wick up any residual moisture left before you put it away."
2,Jones-Stephens Self-closing valve,"The valve reduced pressure a little too much for the application I was wanting to use it for (""Sunflower"" shower head). I ended up just using a regular ball valve instead. The body of the valve was very much heavy duty with a real nice finish, but I received the product without the cotter pin that secures the stem to the handle and the chain broke after just a couple of uses. I think this valve would be a pretty good fit maybe for a low pressure or water-saver shower head, but the volume it produces just doesn't accommodate high volume applications. I would have probably given it a 2.5 or 2.75 rating if I was able....."
3,Great Product,"I was impressed with the quality of the valve for the price I paid. Installed, it worked very well except for having to make an adjustment a couple times to eliminate a minor leak. It was installed at an outside shower by a swimming pool at a private campground and is holding up well in its first year."
5,Must Read!,"This book will become a classic and, in my opinion, deserves to be on the list of prayer books with the likes of E. M. Bounds and other great prayer warriors. Morris Means has learned how to have an intimate relationship with God through prayer. It would be wise of us to follow the steps this man has taken and proven to be effective in his search for God through prayer! This book is FOR EVERY PERSON WHO DESIRES AN INTIMATE RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD."
5,The Art of Seeking God,"Like a previous reviewer, I too know Morris Means. So I was aware when I ordered the book that it was not going to be ""fluff."" Prepare to be convicted. Yet the book reflects the author's nature--gentle, humorous, and zealous for the Lord. The book makes sense. The contents are easy to read and thought-provoking. Or should I say spirit-stirring?"
1,Poor quality,"What dreck -- does the world really need more Penthouse/Forum type letters/stories? These are the most basic, dated kind of stories - avoid."
1,Still All About the Guy,"Women? Hmmm. We want to climb into a story and be the character. I thumbed through these stories looking for one with a female narrator. She's probably hidden somewhere in the book, but it wasn't worth the effort to look after six failed attempts. Even if the female characters in the book were sensual, beautiful, enticing, etc., they were always being described as such by a male character who was going to have something done to him. So what. I don't want to have to work to get a turn on from a story. I want the narrative from the female's perspective. Presented that way, it makes it easier for me to slip in to the story and be the female character. If I'm always trying to mentally rewrite a man's story to fit myself, then the true story does not awaken the primal part of me. The stories we have in our own heads are richer than those between the pages of this book. My advice: Women, pass this man by."
1,Won't purchase again,"I had hoped to add some healthy benefit for my dogs and this product failed miserably. I measured as the bottle says and administered into the dog water system. The dogs wouldn't drink out of it despite this being their only source of water while we tried it. After three days all four dogs showed sensitivity with red ears and paws; one broke out in hives on her stomach! It was a waste of money. Before you complain I did something wrong this was the only thing that changed, once it was gone so was the problems.-SRedwood Siberians(breed not known for sensitivity)"
3,"Heavy, simplistic grooves","To their credit, these Germans were metalcore long before it sported mascara and sing-along choruses. Heavy, simplistic grooves dominate, with occasional speedy metal moments. The screamed and growled vocals grate after a while. Little stands out, although the first song features interesting lyrics about German guilt over the Holocaust."
5,"Loved it then, and Love it now",When will the DVD set be available? Season 2 was hilarious and I can't wait to re-experience all of those laughs once again.
1,the lost world season 2,"I wonder what's going on with the release of the seasons of a different world. it must be a business conflict between the studio and distribution company. I hope this situation gets solved soon. from the tv buff.bx,n.y."
2,Seasons 2-6,"It is so hard to find DVD's for shows that you love. I have been waiting for years for Seasons 2-6 to come out. If it is possible to send out Season 1 they should continue with the others. Customers shouldn't be teased with just one season. If you don't plan on sending out any of the other seasons, then don't send out any in the first place. They would get so much more business and money if they just release all of them.A Different World - Season 1"
1,LONG DELIVERY TIME,"IM NOT AS UP TO DATE AS OTHERS ON THE PRODUCTION ISSUES WITH THIS ITEM, BUT I ORDERED IT ALONG WITH 9 OTHER DVD'S AND THIS ONE ITEM WAS HOLDING UP MY ORDER. I REMOVED IT FROM MY ORDER AND THE PACKAGE WAS SENT THE NEXT DAY. APPARENTLY THERE IS STILL A BACK UP FROM THE PRODUCERS TO THE SUPPLIERS AND IT TAKES AMAZON OVER A MONTH TO SHIP IT OUT. I DECIDED TO ORDER IT ALONG WITH A PRE-ORDER ITEM IN THE HOPES THAT I GET THEM BOTH AT THE SAME TIME-- NEEDLESS TO SAY I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED :-("
1,Who can we contact to request seasons 2-6 be distributed?,"I noticed the last reviews for A Different World were from 2007 and it is now 2010 and season one is the only season in distribution. A Different World is one of the greatest television series and I am so surprised that seasons 2-6 are not being distributed. Who can we contact to make a request? This show for me and so many others brings back so many memories, good times! Please if anyone has any information please post!"
1,"Watch out, actual item shipped is 850mAh, not 1100 as described",Title says it all. Watch out for suppliers that swap out to a lower performance battery.
3,Good work by Wong,"This was the first book I bought on Wing Chun, and have found the book itself to be a good effort to introduce students to what Wing Chun is, as opposed to Karate or Shaolin or... Within are examples of Sticking Hands excersises, Wooden Dummy techniques, and Wing Chun freesparing. I like the fact that the author presents three different versions of the styles origins, allowing the reader to keep an open mind. The basic techniques are fairly well presented, with two camera angles being used. My only real complaint is that some of the techniques in the form, sparring, and Sticking Hands section are not shown in the basic techniques section. I also wonder why the second form was shown, and not the first. However, the section on gates and body zones is very good, and the idea of simplicity and directness is prevalent throughout. For a short but good intro into Wing Chun Kung Fu, buy this book."
3,Not an everyday vitamin,"This is, in my opinion, not a mineral you should take every day. I decided that I only need this one about once a month. It is a trace mineral."
2,Rather disappointing,"The plot and characters are pleasant enough. Grossly obvious and slapstick, but that's one of the things we love about Wodehouse.The big problem for me, though, is the portrayal of Jeeves. In this book he seems much more garrulous and pretentious (classical quotes in almost every scene). He abets the bookmaking of the main character, wearing a disguise and a false moustache. Now, does that really sound like Jeeves? I think not. It should have been done with a new character."
4,Renamed,"I have this book in my library only it is called ""The Return of Jeeves"". It is maddening to think that one has found a new Jeeves book only to discover that it is an old book masquerading under a new title"
5,Does what it's supposed to,"There's not much to say. If you know what you're looking for, this mat is great. Big enough for the tools in our home; and easy to store."
4,"OK Product, Good Customer Service","The first product we received was defective and the company replaced the unit quickly. The product isn't any great innovation over other similar products but, the vendor's customer service was excellent."
5,Best cookbook I have,This is the best cookbook in my collection. I am from Springfield and every recipe is a hit! There are many casserole type dishes that are wonderful and great for a busy Mom to prepare. This is a must for any busy Mom wanting to make great meals for their family!
5,Excellent Anime!,Madlax is one of the best Animes I've seen. The characters are well drawn (without excessive fan service) and the voice acting is excellent. The plot is a bit complicated but well worth the investment in attention. Not for young kids (quite a bit of gun violence although not graphic).
1,Do not buy this.,Between this and Noir I lost over 600 + minutes of my life having to watch this crap. waste of a dub talented actors. Jult Warfell
2,"oh, I wanted to like this novel...","... having lived and loved in Morocco, I have been eager to find someone who can articulate the ferocious mystery of the places I loved.But Paul Bowles -- who loved the desert, spent his life in Morocco -- gives his characters only disdain. They are people dulled by boredom, depression, loneliness... fascinating, probably, but we can't get into their heads. They speak over ours.After the death of one character, the novel becomes something else entirely. Kit's journey through the desert, her captivity in the harem of a desert man, and her descent into madness felt made-up, tacked onto the end of another story, hype, laziness on the part of a talented writer who got bored with his own work."
5,My Favorite novel,"I am essentially a reader. I've spent countless hours reading in my life, and my my career is (can you guess?) librarian. Take my word for it, this book is fabulous. Bowles can transport you. You won't look at life the same way after reading this book. It's beautiful and searing, going straight to a truth like an arrow to a target. It's magic."
3,Westerners in Africa,"I read this book while in Morocco. I remember my paranoia (which is already peaked at the time) increasing ten-fold. But still, it was engaging to read particularly because I was encountering the locations, people, and environment that is showcased by The Sheltering Sky. The plot is not the most compelling one though. So, I am unsure if this book is something I would have enjoyed if I wasn't already there."
2,profoundly annoying,"Three profoundly annoying American expatriates wander around Saharan Africa as, to our great delight, increasingly horrible things happen to them. Exhibit A in the case in favor of my Time Zone Rule, which posits that you should never leave the Eastern Time Zone of the United States.This is a big time cult novel. Folks babble incoherently about how the desert & a ""culture other than their own"" force the characters to confront their inner selves. Yeah right.GRADE: D"
5,SECOND GENERATION LOST,"25 years after Hemmingway in the 'Sun Also Rises'wrote of expatriot rich Americans raising lell in Paris and Pamplona, Bowles spins his tale of ugly Americans, this time in North Africa. Bowles' improbable story is written with much more passion and meaning than was Hemingway's style.Three bored Americans try to discover themselves in the brutally hot and dirty Sahara. Kit and Port try to recapture thier affection and are accompanied by their dull friend Tunner. Drunk and terrified, a vulnerable Kit succombs to Tunner's advances while Port becomes obssessed with native dancing girls.Eventually Port and Kit separate from Tunner in an attempt to regain their love for each other. Port becomes desparately ill leaving Kit emotioanlly unprepared to do what she must do Rather than face the truth and her obligations, Kit escapes from reality and finds herself alone in the dessert and prisoner to the savage ways of the desert."
1,Way overrated!,"I was really disappointed by this book. Maybe I'm old-fashioned, but I like a novel with a plot and with characters who are at least plausible if not interesting. This book has neither. Given the glowing reviews here on Amazon, I kept reading on, assuming that ""this has got to take off soon."" It never did. Nothing led anywhere, nothing mattered, nothing happened. Maybe, as some previous reviewers suggested, that's the point: this book is about nothingness, and thereby makes a statement about the twentieth century soul. But if that's what I wanted, I could just have stared at a blank piece of paper for fifteen minutes. When I read a book, I want to engage with the book on some level, and I did not engage on any level whatsoever with this book. Maybe it's me, but all I can say is ""Reader Beware."" When they say that the desert is the main character, THEY'RE NOT KIDDING. If you're interested in people or plot, look elsewhere."
4,Well-written Self-absorbed Nihilism,"(On behalf of the Revolving Door Book Club) In general, we are confused how this ended up on the top 100 list. Perhaps the members of the group are not into self-absorbed nihilism of which this is a fine example. The movie is a mess and perhaps more confusing than the book."
3,Not a book to forget,"I consumed The Sheltering Sky in one day. It was interesting and I had the time. The end left me very depressed and disturbed. I do not like being depressed and so my first impression was that I did not like this book. Then I read other reviews and decided that a book that can depress you is pretty powerful. On the whole, I got the impression that the Moresby's were procrastinating their life and merely subsisting. Bowles exposes their weaknesses in all areas, Kit's especially. Both the Moresby's lose their sanity at the end, if not more than that. I would give this book four stars except that it didn't give me the desire to read it again. Some passages were very hard to discern and some details seemed unnecessary. As I said before,a very disturbing read."
2,Contrived,"Pointless, convoluted soul searching by irritating characters who could have sorted their problems with a straightforward chat over a cup of coffee. I can only think that Bowles was exploring what happens when already deranged Americans arrive in a foreign land.The conversation is contrived. The thought processes near insane in their detachment from reality (were Port and Kit schitzophrenic?). The attempts to make the mundane seem mysterious irritating (the Lyles were just con artists and thieves - that's all).Certainly Kit's inexplicable behaviour at the death of Port and her subsequent Heart of Darkness like journey into a Saharan erotic mental and physical imprisonment suggests there was a serious mental instability already lurking.In short, they should have been seeking therapy in New York. They were too unbalanced and immature to take a train to Boston (let alone be married)."
2,I love Jane Bowles,"As I read more and more into the life of Jane Bowles, I thought I would benifit from reading some of her husband's work. It enrages me to think that he became the famous one, for he lacks all the wit and charm of his wife's writing. The only thing I feel I got out of this book was a small biographical view of his feelings for his wife (Kate/Jane, come on folks, it obvious). I you really are a fan of Paul, I recomend reading ' A Little Orginal Sin' the biography of Jane Bowles, just for a further understanding of him. A person always plays them self up, it is in through around him that was see who he truly was. He was a good man, but his story is not everything."
2,Classic Work...not for me,"Admittedly, I only got through 2/3 of this book but having read many of the reviews on this site, I knew what to expect and decided to stop reading. First, this is a classic work in the vain of other Beat generation writers such as Kerouac. However, this book did not work for me, possibly because of my South Asian heritage. While Bowles makes a worthy effort at portraying middle east culture as alienating and disorienting to the average American, I just couldn't buy the ""mysteriousness"" of Moroccan culture. The world is a much smaller, more cosmopolitan place than it was in 1947, so it was hard for me to relate to crucial elements of Sheltering Sky's main character, the desert."
4,Well-written but confusing,"The Sheltering Sky was an interesting novel with well-written descriptions that transport the reader to the vast desert of North Africa. Bowles also offers great psychological insight into the characters' personalities; however, I found the last section abrupt and somewhat confusing. After reading the description on the back of the book, I expected to see a gradual change in the characters, which was present, but most of the changes in Kit (one of the three main characters) seem to occur suddenly when there are about 60 pages left to read. I'm not sure that I got everything out of reading this novel that I was supposed to, but I will say that the three main characters were very interesting, and the mother and son who kept turning up everywhere were amusing. I would recommend this novel, but not if you are looking for a quick and/or easy read."
2,No cultural insights,"An unsatisfying book, recounting an implausible story of sheer fantasy with no/little pretensions of reality. I chose the book expecting to glean cultural insight of places (Algeria in this case) that I'll never visit, based on book-cover and online write-ups with remarks such as ""devastatingly imaginative observer of the West's encounter with the East"" and ""Paul Bowles examines the ways in which Americans' incomprehension of alien cultures leads to the ultimate destruction of those cultures."" The book attained none of this, it dwelled for pages on sheer fantasy, highly implausible events, characters of dubious sanity, and offered no cultural insights beyond recounting the heat and grit of African life, with both of which I'm already familiar."
2,"Unsympathetic characters, ambiguous setting","A novel in the tradition of dissolute sojourns by privileged but dissatisfied figures, Bowles attempts to beautify desolate landscapes and repressive Saharan locales, but for this reader he fails. None of the characters are sympathetic, they are merely foils of the ugliest sort: ugly Americans, thieving and conniving Brits, scoffing French officers, amorphous Arab and African stereotypes. Read and enjoy this if you are or like alcoholic and licentious blue-bloods and enjoy suffering in yourself and others, because suffer you will as you read the painful travails of Kit, Port, Tunner, and the others. I can sympathize more with protagonists from Henry Miller, Ernest Hemingway, John Dos Passos, and even Fitzgerald, much more so than Bowles' agonists. The best book about being trapped in a sandy hell hole is Abe's ""The Woman in the Dunes."""
4,The effect of the Sahara Desert...,"Port, Kit and Tunner are supposed to be friends that decide to take a trip to North Africa to explore the desert, know more about the culture, and drink tea with the locals...Port and Kit (the couple) decide to separate from Tunner since he is trying to get Kit's attenion which get's on Port's nerves. So they do, and do their own travelling.Port and Kit live the real experiences crossing the desert, they have the chance to mix with the locals, and get to learn more on the desert, and the challenges in belonging their. Their learning experiences come with a very precious price that they have to pay...Tunner on the other hand takes a less risky approach, and keeps trying to get Kit's attention. When he does, he founds out that it's too late...The beginning of the story is a little slow until you know all the characters, and what are they about...The book is real, and it keeps you excited and reading on the edge, the last third of the book is just unbelievable..."
1,Intriguing Book Unravels,"I read ""Sheltering Sky"" after seeing the movie by Bernardo Bertolucci. Usually I see a film AFTER reading the book, but this film, in a Bertolucci retrospective, was intriguing and left me with many questions about the characters that I thought might be resolved in the novel. The novel was unfulfilling in terms of understanding the main character's motivations, particularly those of Kit and Porte. Nonetheless, the first half of the book, set in North Africa, probably Algeria, was compelling. However, in my opinion ""Sheltering Sky"" deteriorated as the story focuses on Kit. Without giving the plot away, I'll say only that her behavior turns incomprehensible and disturbing. Sheltering Sky unexpectedly degenerates into a kind of gothic novel -- which is not the genre I wanted to read."
3,something new,Purchased the book for Literature class... Not bad. Not something I would have purchased on my own.. But I can say that I'm enjoying it.
5,As wonderous as the land it explores,"This book really would go better in the ""nature essay"" section of the bookstore than ""literary criticism"" (who reads that, really?). The best parts of the book are the sections where Herring talks about living in Yellowstone National Park. They make you want to head off to Wyoming, like, right now. Highly recommended."
5,biggest fan ever,"this is one of the best songs ever. i do all my school work to this. blink 182 rule. i kick any ones ass who disses them or this song. i love you so much blink 182 xxx xxx xxx xxx ("",)"
4,Teacher review,"I have been using this video to introduce Calder to students for several years. Unlike the other Calder titles available; ""mobile"" and ""circus"" it is much newer, with better music, narration, and more comprehensive information on his life and work. There are many personal anecdotes about him that can get even the most negative student to smile. You can show this to model mobiles, stabiles, wire sculpture or the idea of professional collaboration. The only drawback is the artistic nudity (including several whimsical penises)."
2,What's not working. Fine there. The rest is questionable.,"Her skepticism on what is not working is right on, but it's nonsense to add ""what doctors don't tell you"" to the title. There are several excellent books by oncologists reining in the enthusiasm for cancer treatment.Should I Be Tested for Cancer?: Maybe Not and Here's Whyis the best and is on my bookshelf. Read that instead.Homeopathy is utter woo-woo. Chinese herbs? Cmon. And then to end the book with a couple of surviver stories of individuals. Anecdotal evidence is just bad science."
1,Raving Lunatic,"This book is outrageous! I bought it thinking it would have beneficial alternatives to radiation therapy, and chemo, which it borders on, but the author is so hysterical in her findings and beliefs, that her ""facts"" seem unrealistic. It's almost as if she pulled every ""fact"" and ""statistic"" from the JAMA, more like from one article, and rewrote it in her own freaked out voice. I suffer from sarcoma (soft tissue cancer) and this book is not very calming...it's insane. Eat right, take care of yourself, and get second and third opinions...end of story, no need for theatrics or books bordering upon medical conspiracy theories..boooooo. I want my money back. This book wasn't worth the paper it was printed on."
4,A major new approach to diagnosis & theory,"Fonagy, et al present a thorough and careful reconsideration of the nature and etiology of psychological symptoms and syndromes. They integrate the latest relational concepts of psychoanalytic thinking with the latest concepts of neuropsychology. The result is both radically new and consistent with the best of the foundations of psychoanalyis (Pierre Janet's 19th century understanding of the role of trauma; Freud's pre-recantation focus on trauma).The writing varies from chapter to chapter, apparently with different authors (not identified by chapter). It is consistently relevant and worthwhile, but some chapters are clearly written and easy to follow, while others are a bit turgid and require dedicated attention."
5,"Feeling ""out of it""? The answer may be here.","A great book! Not for the casual reader, but if you want to know the very latest in thinking about attachment in human development, you'll get it here. If you're interested in human attachment theory, you'll know what I mean. If you're reading this review and don't know what I mean, try the book, just because you're interested. You just might find what you're looking for."
1,Disappointed,"As an upper grade teacher, I do not recommend this as a resource for your students. If you like throwing a bunch of roots and affixes at your students without any connection or scaffolding, then this resource is for you. Buying this was a mistake."
1,Bad Form for a Writer,"I was born in the area where this story is set and I would guess I am older than the author. I recognized almost all of the major ""fictional"" characters and I must say I am perplexed as to why these people who I and I am sure many others know are so thinly veiled.For example, there is only one attorney in town who is named ""Myron."" He is portrayed in such an unflattering way, so unlike the fine man he is. Also, I know who ""Sarge"" is and also the woman who is the star in the pornographic film. I found it incomprehensible why a writer would do this. The people who are portrayed as ""fictional"" characters must be frightfully embarrassed. It made me very uncomfortable to read this story. Someone should have advised Stevens that this is very bad form for a writer. Very bad form, indeed.Heather SerenePhiladelphia"
4,I read all night,"I found this to be a thoroughly enjoyable read and stayed up to finish it during the wee hours of the morning. The dialog was great and I could hear the voices of Steve and the lovely Gina in my head during their phone chats. While the story line is fiction, much of the sitation rings true. And the nostaliga that I feel when I go back home is just as strong. Care of an aging parent takes many folks back into the surroundings that were once familar and it can be a shock and a heartbreak to find that the seamier side of life has gotten a strangle hold on the neighborhood that we so innocently loved as children. Good read!"
2,Disparaging Portrait,"This is a very disparaging portrait of the Coal Regions. It can't be called a novel as it is a one-dimensional narrative with no character development. If the author's purpose is to trash the area where he was born, he has succeeded. An amateurish attempt, through and through.Ruthie Friday"
3,EGOTISTICAL JOURNEY,"What an ego trip!! I think the author wrote this to show everyone how superior he is to everyone in his home town.This work is typical of many ""novels"" that are out there today. There is no character development, no catharsis that happens in the story--it is just a flat telling of a tale to satisfy the ego of the writer."
5,This is the Ramayana that should be read.,"Beautiful storytelling, picturesque language, colorful and exciting - this is the Ramayana one has been waiting for.From childhood I have been told the story,read different books and seen various plays and thought I knew the Ramayana inside out.Once you read this version you'll actually understand the story in its entirity.And it is fascinating.Everything has fallen into place."
1,false info,This packag size will not pass TSA regulations. I bought this product for air travel and never got to use it.
5,Beautiful songs that bring back memories,"As a little girl, I grew up listening to the artists featured on this CD. It contains wonderful music that makes you sing along and remember good old times. This music is embedded into mexican musical culture as classics that will forever hold a touch of beauty."
4,Disobey,The best explanation for the true nature of government. A manifesto for liberty and disobedience. I highly recommended this book. It's short and straight to the point.
3,Kindle Book,My wife ordered the book for her Kindle. I think she liked it. I Will ask her when she finishes work today
4,HDT,I love my kindle. Many free titles and quick download. I have wanted this book since HS (1980). Finally have it. great??
4,Stand Up!,"This is a fantastic essay on standing up for what you believe in -- Thoreau was a true iconoclast and a great life model. The only worry about this essay is that it can be easily cherry-picked to fit an ideological stance all across the spectrum. It is more concise and focused than some of hos other works, but perhaps for that reason, less quotable."
3,Interesting but dated,"I like the things that were talked about - small government, rule of the people, free rights, anti-war and libertarian views but I found the language and presentation kind of dated and verbose."
3,civil disobedience,"Civil Disobedience....A short book I found interesting only because I wanted to know what people thought before my time. His ideas then, are the same as ours now. The consequences of rebellion for him were more numerous than ours now, but the consequence itself is more severe for us now than in his time. Example: he sits in a little jail cell looking out the bars of a window...contemplating....vs....going to one of our prisons now???????....ack...."
5,A Fast but Powerful Read,"If you have any interest in government; what it is and what it should be, you owe it to yourself to go back 160 years and read this essay. You might be surprised to learn just how much of Thoreau's thoughts fit so well in our problems with government today."
5,Be carefull to not to go to prison,"Thoreau is considered (one of) the Anarchism's father. This book influnced people like Proudhon and others. Its good to see how miserable the system we own created and everyday we feed can be, better, can make people to become insensitive and selfish. By raising a protest against false liberty, poperty and inviting people to think in a life of serving those ""above"", H. Thoreau invites - at least me - to think again in what Im doing here and what can I do to change things."
4,Postal Service on Xanax,"These guys take the best bits of Postal Service (the indie sensibility & glitchy beats) but infuse it with an introspective melancholy that perfectly suits moments when the mind is reeling and needs to pause. Wow, that sounds pretty pretentious. What I should have said is that it's good stuff to take to bed with you, either to drift off to or get busy with your special lady friend to. The singer has the voice of an angel, albeit a sad bastard angel, and his singing rises just enough above a whisper to break your heart. As for the music, it's very good, especially for a first album. On the whole, it nicely distinguishes itself from the glitch-pop masses."
3,"Boring For Adults, Great for Children","I wouldn't recommend buying this book if your an adult, the stories aren't very exciting and the narratives aren't very deep. But for a child anywhere from 5th grade-middle school or even high school I would highly recommend it."
2,Too much information for my kids,"What a shame! The book IS beautiful. I had hoped to give it as a gift to my 5 year old, but the biographical notes are much too sexually explicit."
2,Warning. Non-removable sub-titles,"in the version I received,although the movie soundtrack is in English, when you first put in the dvd it gives you a choice of which of the scandinavian languages you want the sub-titles to be in. At no point then or later is there an option for having no sub-titles. Also they are in thick white letters, and are very obtrusive."
3,Wheels Of Terror,"Even though the film falls short of the book and it was made on a limited budget(reason for which I gave it only 3 stars) it was still entertaining. I wish some big studios would bring to life all the other books written by Sven Hassel.Adventure,action,carnage,war and humour would all interact in these movies if only someone would invest time and money...but since the Danish hold all the rights for making movies based on Sven's books...there's not much chance of seeing them on the screen and in the style that only the Yanks could produce.The movie is about a group of german soldiers who hate nazis that are sent behind enemy lines to blow up a strategical railway/depot,more or less it is a one way ticket."
2,Carmen Sandiego Math Detective,"It should be a pretty good software, but it is not updated for MacOS X, so this does not work properly at many occasion on newer Macs. Please not that it will not run on Intel Mac at all. If you are still using old Macs with OS 9s, you would be much happier."
1,Does Not Run on XP,"I've tried to get this to run on two different Windows XP machines. Both receive the ""memory error"" commonly attributed to it. I've tweaked and tweaked my virtual memory settings and while I have a ton of games and CDs that do work, this one does not.I want a refund."
1,I'd give it zero stars if I could,"My 8 year old son struggled with this and asked me for help. I had no idea how to help him! All we did was answer math questions, there was no purpose or adventure to be had. Sorely disappointed after all the fun we had playing Where in the World is Carmen San Diego.What a waste this game was, of time and money!"
4,Like Sushi,"This book is is wonderfully presented with great informations, but a can leave you a bit hungry. It's a great bargin and a nice quick referance for teachers. I have found many points that have not been addressed in thicker and more expensive books. The exercises they have chosen to illustrate are well thought out because they offer idea's on how to modify similar exercises. A great workbook for current students and instructors."
2,there has to be a better pregnancy pilates workout,"I have been doing Pilates matwork for three years. when I became pregnant, I still wanted to continue with the workout but knew I needed to make some modifications. I found that this book was not very informative or helpful. The exercises were limited and several of them were perfomed while you're on your back. There are better exercise books that also work your core."
1,Too much information equals not enough,"In trying to cover every possible version of a Toyota truck made from 1989-91, this manual is a confusing mess of information. You have to weed through six different procedures to find the one that applies to your model, and then it's usually way over-simplified to be of any value. No doubt this was done to save space in order to try to cover everything, but ends up not covering much of anything. In reality I use Internet sites to find info about my Toyota way more than this manual."
3,Chilton's Toyota Truck Repair Manual,"When ever I purchase vehicle I alway buy a repair manual & this time is no exception. I've only had to use it once so far & it has been very helpful. The book was brand new & still wrapped in celophane, the seller shipped it very quickly, I would buy from them again."
5,A fantastic vision,"Power of 10 is a great short film, though I have not seen the others. It credits the book ""Cosmic View"" by Kees Boeke from which the original idea comes. http://www.vendian.org/mncharity/cosmicview/"
5,Great Gift,Captivating. Astonishing. I could watch it again and again. This makes a great gift. I have already given this DVD to three people who love it every bit as much as I do.
5,"The very big, the very small","The human mind has a difficult time comprehending the very big (bigger than a football stadium) and the very small (smaller than a tick).This shortcoming was overcome, to some degree at least, with ""Powers of 10.""I remember seeing the ""first"" B&W; version in 1973 in an astronomy class at the the University of Colorado, and I was truly astounded by it. Our professor somehow got a 16mm print of it.I recently got a copy if it, and it holds up amazingly well."
4,A hidden treasure.,"Most people will only ever assosiate the Eames name with the utilitarian furntiture that fills the airports of the world, if they know them at all. This is a great showcase of two people who had an incredible career of creativity. From furniture to toys to musical instruments to films they could do it all. Who else could possibly cut such a wide swath through the world of design? Nowadays it takes huge bloated companies with pretentious designers and staffs of idea thiefs to produce the same quality of work that Charles and Ray put out (ok, they had a staff, but still). ""The Powers of 10"" film puts to shame the film strips of my youth and I'm disgusted that in all my years of public school I was never shown any of their films. The whole series is an inspiration to anybody who fancies themselves creative in any way."
3,Average,"An interesting storyline about tapestries but not a book I feel compelled to own-- not a 'keeper' in my opinion, but certainly not a waste of time to have read."
1,A dis-service to the Tapestries,"If you have ever had the chance to sit and gaze at these magnificent tapestries in Paris, skip this book. It is nothing but a cheap romance novel that tries to drag these fantastic pieces of art and symbolism down with it. If you are truly interested in the tapestries, read one of the marvelous interpretations of their possible meanings. Some interpretations are sexual, others religious, all better stories than this one. I wish I could erase her version of the story from my head.If Tracy Chevalier wants to write yet another story about an artist's seduction of a maid, perhaps she can stick with a minor work and not one so rich in meaning."
5,"Believable, entertaining, with bits of real history mixed in....","This book was fantastic. I enjoyed every page. I was surprised to find that the book was believable! I found the characters to have been painted so vividly that you really feel a connection. I cannot recommend this book enough. It is rare to find a piece of historical fiction that is likeable to as large a group of readers as I feel this piece to be. It is perfect without dwelling too much on details like the time, geography, etc. This book is really a colorful telling of the tapestries and the story itself is almost as fascinating as the tapestries themselves!"
2,Not impressed,"I don't normally read books of this sort, but I thought I could try to get into it. This was a tedious book, predictable at every turn. After struggling to read the blahty blah and flowery wordiness, I got to one of the most disappointing endings. The author does use great imagery, but the characters are week and hold no power or connection with the reader. I was seriously disappointed, and unfortunately this experience will more than likely keep me away adventuring outside of my preferred genre. Sorry... two stars."
4,The story draws you in,"I really enjoyed this book. Sure, I love unicorns as much as the next girl (young or old), but I also loved the back and forth between the time periods and the mystery of the tapestries coming to life. All in all, a good read."
3,Settle back in the sand and read ....,"As is her forte, Ms. Chevalier takes a relatively unknown piece of artwork and creates an enchanting tale around it. The reader is taken back in time to 15th century Belgium and allowed to witness the creation of the The Lady and the Unicorn tapestries . We are introduced to the materials needed to create such beauty and come to know the people involved with their creation - the weavers, painters, dyers, etc ... , and their families. I found this to be a light and carefree read. This would be a perfect beach read or one where you could escape from reality (at least, for a few hours)."
4,Historical romance,"Like she did with Girl with a Pearl Earring, Chevalier once again takes a real work of art (this time a series of tapestries) and creates a story about their creation that shows how it MIGHT have happened.Nicholas des Innocents is a handsome womanizer and the artist who is commissioned to design a series of tapestries for the thoroughly unlikable nobleman, Jean Le Viste. Le Viste cares nothing for art or love and is only concerned with raising his social status.Nicholas meets the Le Viste's young daughter and she is immediately love-struck. The lovers manage to steal a few moments together, but Claude's parents are determined to keep them apart.Strong characters, well-researched historical details, and a few dirty jokes (let's just say Nicholas uses the story of the unicorn's horn as a unique and quite effective pick-up line) will keep readers turning pages."
5,A Great Read,"This was just a great book. I read it after Tracy's Girl with a Pearl Earring. In this book, there are a cast of characters that all have a chapter or chapters told from their perspective, thus it is not all told by one person in GWAPE. I found parts of this book very romantic and sexual. I could clearly envision these characters and the places in my mind based on Tracy's descriptions. An absolutely fantastic book!"
3,Weaving Sex,I agree with Claire Guthrie as I feel she is right on the mark. This is the weakest of Chevalier's novels. Yes it's a fast read (the faster the read the less style and substance?) - and yes it talks about the tapestries and tapestry making - but it really did have a lot of unnecessary soft-core porn. Actually of all the Vermeer books that came out at the time of Girl with Pearl Earring I really thought Girl in Hyacinth Blue the best of the lot. But even her second book was VERY LACKING. Once these authors make it big with one book - why do they have to grind them out? Why do they begin to aim for the lowest common denominator instead of striving toward excellence. Or are they all really just one-book writers?
4,Weaving a literary tapestry,"This story is more than just a fanciful historical romance, because Chevalier achieves greatness by tying her tale into the historical record through art. This is a rich literary tapestry that explains the story behind a masterpiece of art, the Lady and the Unicorn tapestries. There are both likeable and unlikeable characters within the novel, but they all come together in the historical record of the artwork. At the end of the novel, Chevalier explains which parts of the book are historically accurate and which are her embellishments for narrative purposes.Overall, this is no comparison to Girl With a Pearl Earring, which is an absolute literary masterpiece, but it is still a great read. First-time Chevalier readers should try Girl with a Pearl Earring first."
5,Chevalier does it again.,"What the Girl With the Pearl Earring was to painting, The Lady and the Unicorn is to weaving. Beautifully told, through the varying viewpoints of the main characters. The libertine artist, the blind daughter of the weaver,the servant girl,and the nobleman's daughter,all are woven into a tapestry.Chevalier definitely knows how to research. She brings to life the art of weaving tapestries, the woad dyer,(and his smell of sheep's urine,) with color and vitality. We see the importance of the Guilds, and the Church in the daily lives of the people. Arranged marriages, and a stay in a convent all help to support the way it really was. Chevalier brings the characters to life, and adds the sights, smells, sounds, and feelings of the period.It will almost make you believe in the healing powers of the Unicorn. Great read."
1,Got halfway through...and had to stop.,"I, too, enjoyed ""Girl with a Pearl Earring,"" as well as ""Falling Angels."" But this was an altogether waste of time. The characters are unbelievable and, frankly, annoying. The storyline was dull and didn't seem to do justice to the actual paintings. I expected more from Chevalier than this cheap, romantic rubbish."
3,Mostly interesting but drags on in a few spots,"I've read Girl with the Pearl Earring and absolutely loved the book (the movie wasn't bad either), so I had hopes that this one would be just as good. Though not as good as the other book, The Lady and the Unicorn is a pretty decent read. All the historical information on how tapestries were made and the long process was actually quite interesting. The narrator of the story switches each chaper which I really liked since it let you see the tale from different views. The story seemed to drag out a bit towards the end, but overall not a bad book to check out."
3,Unrealistic Sex,"I have enjoyed all of Tracy Chevaleir's novels, but I have a nit to pick on this one. The sex between the blind virgin and the artist is so unrealistic I felt I was reading a ""bodice ripper"" from the 1970s. Why be so attuned to historical detail in the rest of the story, and then romanticize first time sex (without foreplay even!) so sappily?"
4,The Lady and the Unicorn,"I had heard of the tapestry a long time ago and saw photos of it in art books as a child. When in Paris a few years ago, I saw the restored original in a museum. That sparked my interest even more. The book gave detailed information about the making of tapestries. All the steps, from concept to finished tapestry, were fascinating to me."
3,Meh...,"Good enough, but lacking in comparison to Girl with a Pearl Earring. I had hoped for more since Chevalier had done so well."
3,Pleasant amble through history,"Capitalizing on the immense success of her Vermeer novel, Chevalier applies the same formula to a medieval tapestry. She creates a cast of characters -- the painter, the family that commissioned the work, the family of weavers that actually manufacture it -- and weaves a set of interlocking stories around them.It's hard for me to criticize this book because I did enjoy it. I finished it in a couple of hours and at the end I'd learned quite a bit about tapestries and how they were made and about the lives of the people who made them. It's an easy read -- maybe a bit too easy. If I give it only three stars, it's because I closed the last page with the feeling that I'd just consumed a somewhat insubstantial meal. I was never fully engaged with the characters and I never really cared what became of them."
2,happy....to finish it......,"call me just an ""average Jane"" but I like reading stories where at LEAST one character has some redeeming feature that endears the story to me, the reader.In The Lady And The Unicorn I would have been happy to see every character fall off a cliff. From the horrid, rutting painter, to his vain, selfish ""true"" love, her miserable and misery making mother and all the rest are only worthy of a long walk off a short pier. The only recommendation worthy parts of the story were about the tapestry weaving, which were interesting and informative.If your idea of a ""a fun evening reading"" is to sink five feet in dark, depressing and selfish machinations, then this may be the book for you.2 stars for making even unicorns cringe worthy."
3,Good Airplane Reading,"This is my first Tracy Chevalier novel, and, at best, it was an entertaining read on a transatlantic flight. It's a superficial book, I think, with a slight plot and only too forgettable characters. I have spent hours with the Unicorn tapestries at the Cluny, and the book not only failed to add depth or increase my wonderment, but it failed to make me want to look at them more closely. I was never bored, but I was never completely absorbed, either."
3,The Lady and the Unicorn: A Novel,"I enjoyed learning about the process of weaving a tapestry and the many steps and time involved. The story was a little too much in the ""romantic genre"" for me."
3,Average,"This novel had a few entertaining parts, but all in all I found it to be average. No, I wouild not recommend it to others."
1,Clumsy but mercifully quick to read,"One of the advantages of a reading circle is departing from one's normal reading matter. Hence I came to read my first (and definitely last) Tracy Chevalier novel. I know nothing of the Pearl Earring book or film. The poor imagery conjured up by the author does nothing to nourish the reader's soul. Many good reviews seem to mention the book's link with a real tapestry - just because a book has a real (art) artefact for inspiration does not make it a good work of fiction.In short, life is too short to waste it on prose such as this."
4,"Lust, Obsession and Duty","Tracy Chevalier has made a living by weaving stories around famous legends or pieces of artwork. In ""The Lady and the Unicorn"", she continues this trend with a novel about a set of six tapestries created in France in the 15th century.The book follows the tapestries - and the lives they touch - from their creation to their completion, through Paris and Rome. Nicolas des Innocents is a Parisian artist obessessed wtih the legend of the unicorn's horn - and often lets his lust get the best of him. Claude Le Viste, the daughter of the nobleman commissioning the artworks, is a fourteen-year old girl who hasn't yet learned to walk the fine line between lust and duty. And Alienor De La Chappelle, a young Brussels weaver, is torn between obsession and duty.The tapestries take over the lives of these three individuals and everyone they meet, and Chevalier weaves their tales as seamlessly as the tapestries themselves are woven, in a beautiful tale of lust, obsession, and duty."
1,Appalling,"Having seen the exquisite series of tapestries of La Dame et la licorne at the Cluny Museum in Paris, I thought this theme held great promise. What a huge disappointment! What trash! Here is an actual passage (and I am not making this up!): ""Luckily Nicolas didn't have to answer, as he couldn't have spoken. I had placed my hand on his bulge, which was as hard as a tree branch. I had never touched one before."" And much more along the same lines, ad nauseum. I can't believe reviewers have given this 5 stars! Or any stars at all!"
2,disappointed,"I loved Tracy Chevalier's Girl with a Pearl Earring, but this book is not as well-written or enjoyable. The main problem is that the central characters are not likable. Who can sympathize with either a randy, pompous artist or a silly, unthinking girl, or an art patron who can't even see his wife's face in paintings? In Pearl Earring, both Griet and Vermeer are appealing and likable, and we care what happens to them. Plus, in Pearl Earring, the sexual tension is palpable, and I as a reader wanted to know what happened between them. Here, the sex is in-your-face and I didn't care what happened to these characters. Chevalier can do better!"
2,"good idea, sloppy writing","I loved the idea of The Lady and the Unicorn--the time period, the changing points of view, a fiction inspired by a real work of art--and I have enjoyed previous novels by Tracy Chevalier.But Chevalier's writing is getting pretty sloppy. She overwrites and tells the reader what she means instead of showing the reader. For example, she feels the need to tell the reader reapeatedly and explicitly how obsessed the daughter of the nobleman is with the painter, when she could have shown it with the actions of the characters to much better and more subtle effect. It is as if she does not trust her reader to figure it out.Her writing in this novel has also begun to verge on soft porn--meant to excite but not really exciting, perhaps just a ploy to reel in readers. The almost soft porn might be okay, except that it is not believable--I do not believe that some of these characters in these times would do such things so quickly and easily, without a second thought."
5,light and easy,"As all her books, The Lady and the Unicorn, was a very light and enjoyable read. I like her characters and the historic setting. It is a perfect book if you want something in between some heavier or more challenging books."
1,An AMAZING disappointment!,"I was looking forward to the next Chevalier offering; of course, having read all of her former books,THE VIRGIN BLUE,FALLING ANGELS,and the haunting GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING.So? What did I delve into? A short book with anti-heroes/heroines.....thoroughly unlikeable main characters; a tedious recounting of how a tapestry is woven; and a plot so unbelievable that I, a life-long student and teacher of European history could hardly countenance the odd twists and turns. A sexual encounter under a table? Profligate violations of Guild rules? And happenstance pregnancies that presume to add to the story line? It was too much to swallow. Bottom line is that this author is grasping at a momentary glimpse of fame and she had better get her act together before she publishes, or is published, again. Sorry I bought it; and it's a give-a-way to anyone who wants it! Any takers?"
4,"Not Chevalier's best, but good.","I absolutely love this author, but I would not say this is one of my favorite books she has written. At times, you loose touch with the characters. If you have never read any of her books, I would suggest The Girl with the Pearl Earring or The Virgin Blue. However, I did enjoy this book, and it is worth a read."
2,Not what I'd hoped,"I read Chevalier's ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" and loved it; so I thought I'd try another of her novels. This is, unfortunately, not the same caliber. It reads like the trashy romance novels I try to avoid. The character development revolves around sex, which can be pulled off (think Chopin's ""The Awakening""), but it just wasn't in this case. The interaction between various societies, classes, and the art which binds them all is fascinating, but I would have prefered the novel to revolve more around that than some randy artists desire for the various female characters. So, I would definitely recommend ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" but I would not recommend this novel."
5,The Best Dance Album of the Year,Without a doubt this hits on all cylinders. If you like to dance you won't be disappointed with these awesome mixes. Lots of vocals. Some of the best transitions you will ever find. These guys know what their doing. Treat yourself or someone you like to this double CD packed full of great sounding tunes... Go for it.
5,Simply Amazing,This 2 CD set is one of the best GU releases to date (can't understand the bad reviews above). Much better than their Moscow release. If you don't have this in your collection you are missing out!!! After listening to this I can't wait for my Afterclub CD's to arrive.
2,Big disapointment,"Hi all i am shocked to see name Deep Dish on this CD, i am more shocked that people are giving them 5 stars. Some people must be ignorant enough to rate just because they think they are good. I am a DD fan and know and love their music, actually have to say that i am very disappointed as i was expecting funkier dance tunes. Would not recomend to buy if you are DD fans so you won't change your opinion about them."
2,A Step Down,"These guys are two of my favorites, which makes this new release even more of a let down. I have loved every album they have ever put out except this one.Disc one has some redeemable moments, but disc two really didn't have much happening. The whole sound on this was nothing really new, just the same stuff that everyone else is putting out. It just seems like they were trying to wear too many hats and cover too much ground; leaving the whole feel of the sets kind of jumbled with no clear theme.I feel like these guys have always done a very good job of creating a unique sound and feel to their mixes. This mix really lacked the substance and character of their previous work.Altogether a pretty disapointing project from a couple of professionals. I would have expected a lot more from this release. Maybe their upcoming individual releases will make up for this disapointment. Two Stars"
2,A Step Down,"I have loved every one of Deep Dish's mix albums, and this one definitely falls short of their previous successes. I have seen their live set three times in LA and SF, and I am terribly disappointed with this new project.It seemed to me that they were really just trying to wear too many hats with this mix, and ultimately the sets had no substance or cohesive themes to them. Disc one had a few redeemable moments, but disc two was really just pretty lackluster. Just the same old stuff that everyone else is putting out. Nothing new, nothing good, and nothing that will withstand the test of time.I think these guys are very talented so I am at a loss to what happened with this project. Maybe the second release in July will make up for the disappointment. You would think that after having taken a break for a while and building up a following; they would have wanted to put out a more quality sound.I was pretty bummed out on this album. Two stars and that is being a bit generous."
5,Ahhhh finally...,"It's been a long time coming...but nevertheless Deep Dish delivers us from the static that current house music has become. In an era where electronica music has become so repetetive and boring this release makes it all seem worth the wait. I won't even describe the cd because those of us who know the sound...know it well. I have bought many different labels over the years, and still the ""Moscow"" discs are never far from my cd player. I couldn't tell you even the names of the albums that I have picked up from these other bland and boring DJ's, but I can tell you which track (by number) that is good on any of the albums put out by these two artists.If you understand the difference between progress and motion... do yourself a favor and pick up these discs. Don't forget about the up-coming supplements to these discs due out on 7/1/03."
4,Deeply Satisfying & Sure to Please,"I did not know exactly what to expect with this CD. After continually listening to it though ever since I got it (it's been in constant rotation in my car and at home), all I can say is that it is definitely very pleasing to the ear.Deep Dish takes one on a groovy journey with an eclectic mix of songs sure to please even the pickiest of listeners. This CD makes you want to get up out of your chair and dance.The positive energy and upbeat tempos along with the haunting, melodic vocals that accompany certain tracks satisfy that empty feeling many DJ sets leave you with nowadays. This CD will fill that void and will also leave you wanting more..."
3,"CD 1 is classic, but CD2 is average","CD1 has a classic deep dish vibe. lots of great vocals layered on great house, prog & tribal beats. I just love how it flows.CD2 has some great tracks (like Sander K's work to do), but there is no flow to it.Looking forward to the Afterhours mixes."
3,what happened to YOSHIESQUE?,"while this album is not horrible (other than the first track on CD1), it is less than spectacular and in my opinion lower quality than Global Underground usually puts out.If you have ever seen the Duo live, you will know this sound is not typical but of about 5% of their sets. Sharam & Ali... Did you guys loose all your tracks WITHOUT vocals? You dont have to have an album full of vocal tracks. its actually pretty [poor] espically with all the INCREDIBLE house music out there right now (See James Zabiela's album ""Sound in Motion"" available July 14th).Over all i think this album is typical at best. The mixing is smoothe yet uninventive. the track selection is so-so.Keep your eyes out for Danny Howells' new 2xCD 24/7, Global Underground's new series... first disc is chill and experimental... second disc is nice prog house. definitely better than this album"
3,Half an Encyclopedia Set,I gave this product three stars since I only have the second half of the set. The half that I do have is full of information that is very helpful.
2,This is one CD of a four CD set,"This is one CD of a four volume set. I ordered this CD and recieved volume 2. It has 100 birds from willow grouse to sandgrouse. A large percentage are not what I think of as song birds. Lots of chirps and rattles. (I am not a birder). I assume the other 3 CDS have a similar number of birds. This appears to be a set for the serious birder, and not for someone who is looking for a musical treat."
5,Awesome Set,I have used these tools many times by now. There was no problems with these. Great tools.
2,Was working fine until,The brad nailers work fine but the air compressor has left me wanting. It constantly leaks from somewhere I can't find but can hear. It doesn't kick in enough to help me maintain a constant psi so that my nails Always drive to the depth I want. It'll sometimes drop 10 psi before kicking back on. It also makes this weird sound sometimes that sounds like a tool dying. I don't even use it that much.
2,Good guns....bad compressor,"I purchased this combo from a large retailer 3 or 4 years back and used it a good bit to renovate my house. Mainly used for trim, crown molding, and baseboard. Nothing major. After about a year the compressor started to go out and it would not hold a tank of air. Really frustrating. I could not find a service center nearby either so I was stuck with it. After about a year of dealing with it I just bought a new Porter Cable compressor and have had no problems since then. I am still using the guns on a fairly common basis and have not had any major problems. I lost a bump guard from one but that was probably my fault from dropping it. Overall the guns are pretty good and stand up well but I would not suggest this compressor! Ever!"
5,Dewalt Performance Awesome,"I bought the nailer to install 3/4 inch wood flooring. Using the 16 gauge nailer, I was able to fire 2 inch brads throught the tongue of african rosewood flooring. A flooring nailer is recommended for this job but I was able to accurately hit the sweet spot above the tongue every time. African rosewood is much harder than oak and the nailer handled the job without a problem. I also like the versatility of having the 18 gauge nailer which I used to shoot 1-1/2 inch brads through quarter round molding. This unit is light weight but has plenty of power. For $300, it is well worth the price."
5,Best tools for the job,"I've only used the finish nailer so far, but I'm very happy with the results I've had so far. The combo kit shipped fast, a day earlier than even indicated. It's pretty light weight for the power it can provide. And you can't argue with the quality of DeWalt."
1,Would not Recommend!!!,I purchased the set six months ago and would not recommend the set to anyone! I have a home improvement company and always thought that Dewalt was one of the better tool manufacturers. The finish nailer has been nothing but problems from the beginning. Dewalt does give you a three year warranty but you have to take the tool to a service center for them to determine if it is a factory defect. My service center was an hour away in the hood! The customer service representative was rude and very unhelpful. I decided to try to fix the gun myself and found the problem very quickly! All of the parts on the inside of the gun are plastic. Need I go on? The gun is in the garbage where it belongs. I will never buy another Dewalt product! I recommend Bosch tools if you want a dependable one!
4,This works grate,I find that this air nailer works very well in my shop.very ease to set up an use it also travels well I would recommend this product to any craft person
1,SAVE YOUR TIME AND MONEY,A poor quality badly written book with unacceptable spelling and grammatical mistakes and editorial oversights. It is a list of other people's sayings with some trite and obvious ones thrown in by the complier. It is not useful at all for persons engaged in custody litigation.
2,Mostly B material from an A grade band...,"If there were no other Roomful of Blues releases to compare this to WYWYG this CD might fair better, but as it stands, it sounds like B side material to me. There are couple of moments where you can smell smoke but for the most part, I was disappointed. I agree with a previous reviewer in the lead singer has a voice you either love or hate. For me it's his vocals that drag the CD down to what sounds like a better than average bar room band not the wicked engine of ""Under One Roof"", ""There Goes the Neighborhood"" or ""Turn It Up!"". To be fair, Odom has his moments (Your Love Was Never There), but over all his efforts were a miss for me. Some of the horn arrangements are just average too.Hoping for a little more octane in the future..."
1,Roomful in name only,"There was a time when Roomful was a band with a mix of seasoned pros and young talent playing a blend of jump blues, swing, and blues.Over the years there has been alot of personal changes none of the original members are left.Now Roomful has a powerful lead singer with a voice you either love or hate.The band is playing radio friendly tunes.There was a time Roomful was in their own league playing great tunes with a strong horn section.This group sounds like any horn band youd hear in your local nightspot.They are The Roomful Of Blues in name only."
3,All the Same,"All the same, while this is in fact a thrilling book, readers should bear in mind that Gisevius was not completely beyond reproach, and that around the time Diels ws ""deposed"" Gisevius was deputized to go in and forcefully remove him. That there was little choice or that is was a natural progression for him to become an assessor in the security police after the finishing the bar is perhaps true; but while I wouldn't go so far as to deem him a whited sepulchre, he did have dubious designs once in the regime, notwithstanding his later heroism."
3,The Gisevius narrative,"The book is rather lengthy and too detaild, but alot was going on with this famous unknown in the conspiracies to kill Hitler. Fascinating detailes on all involved in the Reich. Fascinating too is how the conspiracies formed within the high circles of civilian and military elite in the late 1930's. I wonder how Skorzheny figured into the conspiracy of 20th July '44?"
4,Other Books,"The updated and enhanced version of the first edition of Advanced Dungeons and Dragons. They also sanitise it a little to keep those whacky religious nuts in the USA happy from memory, as well, as they do in other books.A little bit of the charm of the original is missing, but they do try and make things more consistent."
1,Time to Move on....,"2nd edition was the wrong direction for 1st edition to go... ""zeb"" Cook pissed on EGG's legacy and gave us 2nd editions silly interpretations of AD&D 1st edition."
4,Hawaiian Gold,"This album has lots of good sounds, excellent assortment of different groups to get acquainted with musically, especially if one is not familiar with what I refer to as ""Hawaiian Reggae"". I strongly recommend having this excellent cd."
4,Flat Iron HOT TOOLS,"Great tool, does the job well. Wish it had heat choices of numbers or degrees - this tool has neither - just a wheel of low to high. Its also smaller than I thought and hoped (length)."
2,Died in just under 6 months,Professional in name only the Hot Tools 1177 died after 6 months of very little use (2 or 3 times a week on one person only). Save your money and get something that you won't have to replace in a few months.
5,The best straightening iron,"This is the best straightening iron that I have used. It heats up quickly. It straightens hair easily. It's light and affordable. I am so happy that I found this iron. I have tried many others and this is by far the best. I have thick,wavy hair and I've always had a problem managing it and finding products to make it straight. Now that I have this iron it's easy for me to have my straight look."
4,Wow! Quick and easy styling even for my hard to manage hair,"My hair is naturally very curly and wavy and, well, messy. I had never even heard of a straightening iron until I hit middle school. I didn't use one until 8th grade. I look back on the old pictures and wonder why no one told me my hair looked so bad!This is a great iron, and my thick wavy hair is beautifully straight within 10 minutes. Granted, my hair is not that long, but every hairdresser I have ever gone to has told me I have ""enough hair for two people.""One thing I have noticed is that this iron keeps my hair relatively straight unless it gets completely drenched. This is a huge plus for the Texas heat!All in all, BUY THIS."
2,not good,"I got this after using a HAI flat iron, which I loved but it burned out when I tried to use it overseas. My split ends are worst and my hair gets stuck in the plates. I'm very disappointed in this item and it was recommended to me at the store."
1,Not a great product!,"I have used hot tools in the past and loved them. When my last flat iron broke, hot tools was the brand i wanted. I got this one thinking that the quality of hot tools was great no matter the price, WRONG! This flat iron did not do a good job at all. I have very thick hair, so this one might work for someone with thinner hair. It just did not get hot enough is what i think was the problem. I ended up getting a $50 Con Air product from KMART and it worked wonders."
2,You get what you pay for,"As I paid $20 I really cant complain - but if you are looking for a realy great flat iron, this is not it."
1,Sub-par,"I bought this item from a local beauty supply store. I had several problems w/ the flat iron. First, my hair is fairly long, and when I would slide the hair along the plate, hairs would get caught between the plate and the plastic that held the plate, breaking the hairs. It didn't matter how big or small the section of hair was, some would get caught.Second, the iron completely stopped working after about six months. It was if the ""on"" switch stopped working. Setting the appliance to ""on"" didn't cause the power light to come on, and the appliance didn't heat up. I sent the appliance back to Helen of Troy, only for them to tell me they didn't have a replacement model in stock, and they couldn't tell me when they *would* have on in stock. They didn't tell me this until 4 weeks after I sent them the item for replacement.Long story short, save your money, buy a different appliance!"
4,GREAT flat iron but always breaks on me!,"I've had to repurchase this iron about 6x in the past years. It is, so far, my favorite flat iron, however, it always breaks the same way! One of the two ceramic plates won't get hot anymore. There is something faulty in the manufacturing of this. Everything else is to par, but it is frustrating to always have to repurchase, especially every other hair tool I own (curling iron, blow dryer, etc.) outlives this one every time."
3,new to ceramics,Be sure that you are used to ceramics when you get this. I like my old flat iron with the old metal plates much better. This device brags that there's no space between the plates but that means also that your hair doesn't pull through smoothly. There's nothing wrong with the tool...I just don't like it.
2,Very disappointing,My hair gets stuck in the plates. I thought it was how I was using it but I see others have had the same issue. I prefer my smaller iron by Revlon.
1,I would NOT recommend!,"I initially liked this product until it broke a week after I purchased it. One side would not heat up so I sent it back to Amazon for a replacement. Amazon was great and sent a replacement immediately. I received the second one and it broke about a month after I recieved it. Same problem. One side would not heat up. Amazon's warranty was up so off it went to the Manufacturer. Surprise, surprise. ITEM NOT IN STOCK AND BACKORDERED. They could not get me a delivery date. I am now requesting a REFUND!"
1,Worst iron ever,"All that infrarred crap, and the healthy and silky hair is just a lie, the purple coat you see in there starts chipping off after 3 months of buying it, the iron starts overheating and after several months your hair looks like trash, I bought it as a gift and it was very embarrasing for me..."
1,Just stopped working,"I bought this iron for fifty dollars and really liked it. It came with a year warranty - but I never sent it in, nor did I keep the reciept because: a) I am a disorganized person and b)I have NEVER had a small appliance stop working within a year of buying it. This product, however, did. About six months after I got it I noticed I wasn't getting the results while using it and realized that one of the plates no longer heated up. Not money well spent."
1,Very disappointed in this product,"I have used hot tools many times in the past, including their flat irons. However, this particular one does not clamp down tightly on your hair - I have to clamp it, and then with my other hand close it tightly, and then run it through my hair. It is annoying and adds time to my hair styling. I would not recommend this to anyone."
3,"3"" Flat Iron Too Wide","This iron works fine and I do like the ceramic, I liked my old smaller Hot Tools iron better, the 3"" is harder to use. I would recomend the ceramic 2"" iron."
3,Somewhat helpful,"I'm using this book at the moment to prepare for the exam, so I can't share how well I ended up doing in it. It *is* helpful, especially in the listening and reading sections, and it's always good to get the practice, but the grammar review could have been a lot better and I have seen what I am pretty sure are grammatical mistakes, which, along with some really sloppy editing, made me distrust the rest of the book. It's worth getting, but take it with a grain of salt."
3,Good for studying but could be better,"While this book does help the reader to understand how the AP Exam is set up and provides excellent questions for practice, it does not provide many explanations for the answers. I think that it would be very helpful if the reasons why the correct answer is the correct one would help students learn what areas they need to work on more. There have been several times that I have gone through the exercises and then checked my answers after and have been unsure as to why one answer was better than another, especially if more than one answer seemed to make sense."
1,The Worst,"I personally detest the book. When I took the practice exams, I followed the steps that the writer suggested. The process made my results worse than if I had approahced the question in my way. The strategies are horrible. There also lacks PROPER explanations. I would highly reccomend a competitor book. Princeton Review is byfar the best."
3,Don't go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me,There's a lot of good information in the book. However it basically is outdated the minute a new product comes along. When you buy the book you get a coupon to join a web site [...] which has the same information available and is updated as the new products come out. That may be the better way to go. However the annual subscription rate is $24.95 and when you buy the book you get a discounted rate by 50 %. So. . . . . .
5,Everything you wish your mother knew and told you,"I reccomend this book to everybody. In fact it should be required reading. This book is about so much more than blue eyshadow, or shiny blush (which she does say is OK for night time; who wants to walk around with shiny cheeks in the daytime?), it is about properly taking care of your skin. I have seen a dramatic improvement since taking her advice, and understand how and why products work. Information is power, and it seems to me women could use some clear advice on how and where to spend their money. Paula does this and does it well."
5,Very informative - Helped me save tons of money,"I am very happy I found this book. I have spent tons of money on very expensive product lines that don't work. And it doesn't help that half the time there is someone behind the cosmetic counter who is recommending something that is totally not right for your skin. Paula cuts through all of the hype, and gives good sound advice based on real research. I have tried many of the products that she recommends, and my skin has never looked better, and now I do not have to spend alot of money for good looking skin."
1,a smart advertisement,"This book is one of the smartest advertisements I've ever seen. Paula rips apart every skincare product (even the products that get an 'approval' from her still have a ""but"" or ""however"" following their praise.) The only skincare line that gets her full backing and lavish review? Her own.If you want reviews on a product, do your own homework. Look for reviews from people that don't have their own agenda. You can google most skincare ingredients and learn their pro's and con's."
2,old book,"Amazon send me an e-mail requested a review so here it is. I purchased this book in 2012. It was written years before so the information in it is not current. Some of the skincare products I'm using are not in the book. I realize she has a website but I wasn't that pleased with the book in general. I didn't read the entire book, but I did not find any ringing endorsements from her for any product. Could it be that because she also sells cosmetics, she was dishing her competitors? I don't want to think so, but I was not able to find a ringing endorcement for any skincare product available back then. Don't jump all over me if you found one because I was only looking at the skincare products. The choices seemed to be between those that were worthless and those that ""did the job"". No excitement over any. Since I wanted to know about products available now in year 2012, I threw the book out the same day I received it."
2,Outdated,"The book is very interesting but even in its latest edition it is quite outdated. I learned a lot about products that no longer exist! It was a good read, just old information."
3,Internet site is free,"I actually accessed the product reviews and skin care advice off of Paula's website beautypedia.com. The website is now free and has the most up to date reviews. So why would you buy the book? I think she did this in order to reach a wider audience in order to market her own line, Paula's Choice. I highly recommend you check out her site. Even though I already knew a lot about skin care, Paula has taught me so much! What's great about her is that she not only recommends her products, but also recommends other cosmetics line's products. Who else does that?! Awesome!"
4,Info info and more info,"WOW, this books is loaded with info - much more product review than I was expecting. The downfall to this is it will take a little time looking for specifics - I would recommend this book with knowledge that it is not a fast read rather a resource book (think encyclopedia)"
3,Advice & Contradictions,"Ms Begoun has a strong tendency to bad-mouth the more expensive lines of cosmetics. No one wants to spend more than they have to, but too often, she just looking at the price. She's negative about lines like La Prairie, but gives them a good rating and a recommendation at the end. Has she ever used La Prairie for a substantial period of time & had a cosmetologist say, ""I don't know what you're doing to your face, but keep it up. Somehow that comment and the feel of your face doesn't make the expensive jar of Age Management Cream seem so wrong. Instead of just listing the ingredients, she should try some of the products."
1,Scientific?,"Paula Begoun has built up an amazing business and marketing machine based on very little actual scientific fact and mostly biased opinion. If you've ever seen this woman give an interview ... well, let's just say her poor complexion and 80's makeup job speaks for itself. This is like the portly Dr. Phil writing a diet book and everyone flocking to read it.You've got to give the woman credit though. She's taken her opinion, common sense and sketchy science background and turned it into a very lucrative business."
1,complete personal bias,"There is no objective advise here. While I've worked in Cosmetics and know there is a lot of hype, there are great products out there that she just completely destroys - mostly anything plant based. Not all here descriptions are valid and unless you have terribly sensitive skin, you can just ignore this book. The truth is keep your reciept! Take a tack and pin the reciept and box to a bulletin board and try the product your interested in, if you don't like the result, return your products to the store. If in 4 weeks you don't see ANY difference, it's not working for you! But this book will simply scare you, when most products are perfectly safe without reactions."
1,Biased!,"Let me save you some time: Paula has something negative to say about every product on the market except for her own. I find that a lot of her information is suspect and some is just plain incorrect.In my opinion, she has no place critiquing other products while she is trying the schlep her own.If you are interested in the ingredients in products, buy Milady's skin care and cosmetic ingredients dictionary. It is educational, easy to understand, and impartial. It will be a better use of your money."
2,THOUGHT PROVOKING,"ANY PUBLICATION WHICH AIMS TO DEBUNK COSMETIC HYPE HAS TO BE GOOD NEWS.BUT - AND IT'S A BIG BUT - ONE SKIN'S MEAT IS ANOTHER SKIN'S POISON.PAULA BEGUN GIVES THE BIG THUMBS DOWN TO THE ERNO LAZLO LINE BUT IT'S THE ONLY ONE THAT HAS EVER COMPLETELY WORKED FOR ME.OBVIOUSLY,MY SKIN,LIKE ITS WEARER,HAS EXPENSIVE TASTES.ALSO,COSMETIC LINES CHANGE ALMOST FROM DAY TO DAY,IT THEREFORE FOLLOWS THAT ANY SO-CALLED COSMETICS BIBLE WILL BE OUT OF DATE ALMOST FROM THE DAY IT HITS THE SHOPS.WHEN IT COMES TO CHOSING COSMETICS,THE ONLY SURE FIRE WAY IS TRIAL AND (OFTEN COSTLY!) ERROR."
1,"Ugh, Don't believe the Hype","Paula is a woman who is way out of touch with reality and is just really looking to sell her own products. She does say that these are her opinions. A person's opinions mean very little to me because like rear ends everyone has one. And in Paula's case, her opinions mean nil. I tried some of the products from her line and found them to be quite blah. She really needs to tell people in her book not to buy the garbage she sells. The only way to find out if a product works for you or not is to get some samples and try it out. There is no mass recipe for skin care, it is trial and error. All skin is different and no two people are alike. Just because something works for a friend, doesn't mean it will work for you. And Paula ain't your friend so I don't know why anyone bothers to listen to her. She has drummed a nice profit out of her little books, emerging into her own website with products she has for sale. Wake up people."
1,Not what I expected,"I found this book at my local library before purchasing. I was glad of that b/c I won't be buying it. A much better read is Natural Organic Hair and Skin Care by Aubrey Hampton, creator of Aubrey Organics who this author does not give credit due for his hair and skin line. I found Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter without Me more of a personal opinion of almost every cosmetic product on the market. It get's tedious. If you are looking for overall advice you're better off with Hampton's book which has been around a long time."
1,Shameless self-promotion in the guise of expertise,"I was hoping to garner useful information about selecting skin care product lines, but I soon tired of this book after reading numerous negative critiques. Begoun's negative tone was much too strong and repetitive to take her critiques seriously. It seems that only her line receives 100% high marks. It made me wonder how Begoun was able to evaluate ""over 35,000 products,"" effectively.This book lost all credibility when the author included her own line of skin and hair care products within the book. It was not surprising all of Begoun's products were posted in Paula's Picks as the best products to use. It was shameless self-promotion."
4,STILL GOOD - BUT IT'S BECOME MORE CONFUSING,"If you're a fan of Paula's previous book - this 5th edition isn't much different than the 4th - except for review of Men's skin care (who cares) and baby products - the Internet Address list is gone - and the ""Best"" product lists are WAY WAY too long, which makes readers confused. The quality of the paperstock is much poorer than edition #4 and while there are many new reviews -- if you haven't changed products, then your 4th edition will pretty much serve your needs. I am HUGE fan of Paula's - both her books and her products (which incidentially are terrific) but I wasn't swept away by the 5th edition - and for someone like myself (oily-skin), the categories for ""bests"" are numerous and confusing. There's a huge section on basics of skin care which is good but nothing readers of Paula's books don't already know."
4,Exceeded My Expectations,"I received this book as a gift, and I was impressed with the detail Begoun includes. My favorite part was the introduction and brief essays on skin care, which have proved effective in clearing up my skin within days. Her makeup reviews are harsh, to say the least, but a buyer concerned only with getting the most effective products for the lowest price can count on this as a reliable resource. Personally, I love having cute products and indulging in something because of the packaging and color, so her no-nonsense reviews take away a bit of the fun in shopping for makeup. But for the more sensible of you out there, Begoun presents cosmetic reviews in a straight-forward manner."
1,Don't Go To The Cosmetic Counter At All - Instead Buy PAULA'S Product!!,"The first thing that flew out of the book when I took it out of the Amazon box was Paula's advertisement for her own product! I was completely shocked and felt like a dummy! I understand that she may feel, with all her research, she is an expert on the field, and even understand how she could possibly come up with an ideal product....but for goodness sake be SUBTLE!She should at least let the reader discover Paula's product (alphabetically listed)slowly. I can even get past ALL the smiley faces her own product gets, but I definitely don't want an insert to fly out of the book when I first open it. This is completely in poor taste, and I don't feel she can be objective!Having said all this, she may have valid points, she may have done great research, she may have the best product, but I really don't care, as I feel like an ABSLOUTE sucker for spending $20 for buying her advertising gimmick."
1,Not for Kindle!!!,Kindle is not a user-friendly format for this book. You must scroll through page after page of product review from A-Z until you find a product you are interested in reading about. The information is excellent but the kindle format does not do it justice.
3,Not what I was expecting,Pretty plain looking book on the inside. Of course a very personal opinion by the writer. I scanned through it and selected my 'favorite' cosmetics which had conflicting views to mine. So based on that I didn't feel it would be worth keeping - returned it.
3,Handy,"It's not really a book you will sit down and read from front to back, but it really is a great guide if you're even online browsing for products and to have it with you. It's a bit impossible to take the actual book with you TO the cosmetics counter, I think, since it is so thick! But it's great that it has the smiley-face ratings :) I give it a smiley rating of my own as well :)"
1,credibility et al...,"at first i thought: what a clever book. then i did a bit of research myself: on paula... only to discover that the author has her own beauty line out. okay, no problem - but what do i see as `her' ingredients? PEGs & 'parabens' & all the other carcinogenic stuff that is sooo good for you. o well, paula..."
1,Do not buy this book!!!!!!!,"After 5 hours of reading and plowing through 1362 pages of frustrating information I finally realized why I could not use any of the reviews provided by Paula. SHE IS SELLING HER OWN PRODUCTS! While she blasts doctors for having conflicts of interest in selling THEIR products, she does the same thing........you just don't know it until you have wasted your entire day. I am furious!!!!!!!! Please do not waste your time on this book. I am either going to demand my money back for or throw it in the trash."
1,Is she really unbiased?,"I bought this book with enthusiasm, but when I learned the author has her own line of products I felt like I had totally wasted my money. How can she honestly have an unbiased opinion when she has a real need to knock down other products? I disagree with many of her opinions and I wonder how many times she tried a product or company. For example, she doesn't have a whole lot of positive things to say about Mary Kay, but I wonder how many consultants she went to. I love my consultant and she has never done any of the things mentioned in this book! Maybe the author just had an unfortunate experience that most people won't have. At any rate, I take her ""advice"" with a grain of salt. I just don't possibly think she can be unbiased while she is selling her own line. Which of her own products does she not like?"
2,Go to your dermatologist,"While the book was comprehensive and somewhat informative, I found it to be biased and sometimes irrelevant. Examples of both: Janet Sartin cosmetics are no more expensive than other department store brands, and what does a lawsuit against Mary Kay have to do with whether or not I should buy an eyeshadow? I received much better information from a dermatologist."
3,"A good reference book, but basically self promotional","As I have really sensitive skin which is also combination, I'm always looking for any assistance in the skincare department. The book gives a good overview of most of the products out there, but I don't always agree with her ratings or opinions on effectiveness . The book is also a good soapbox for Ms Begoun to promote he own range of skin care products, which I find a little tasteless. On the whole, not a bad investment, but don't believe every word she says. Her advice on cosmetic ingredients and their listing is invaluable though. I also agree strongly with her views on ""natural"" products being harmful, as an apprentice Naturopath I know that natural doesn't mean harmless, quite the contrary."
5,Don t go to the cosmetic counter without me,"This book will save you a lot of money. I tossed out a lot of the old products I had purchased that were rated not good to use...I think anyone will find the product reviews useful, regard of the age of the person."
3,Don't Go to the Cosmetics counter Without me,"This book is so comprehensive that it is very confusing. So many of mainline store products are disapproved of, a person has a hard time deciding just which product to buy. Of course, the author's products are all fine, which leads me to think that the book is a huge advertisement for her products.sincerely,M.V.Rich 3-2-08"
4,"Good book, good advice","I think this is a very good way to buy decent cosmetics. One thing though, is that the author gives a bad rating for products that she says have skin irritants in them. I think everyone is different and wouldn't necessarily have a reaction to some of those things. I've used several of the products that she says will irritate skin, and haven't had a problem. (And I have very sensitive skin.)"
4,good makeup guide,"I thought this was a good guide for buying makeup and skin care. I was using one of the ""expensive"" skin care lines and read that it was basicly the same thing as a less expensive line. I tried it and switched- saved me some money. There were, however, a few products that were given a ""thumbs down"" that worked very well on me. It basicly depends on your skin type. Overall, it did save me some cash. I definatly recommend it!"
5,Almost could'nt Get this book back!!,What a great reference to have. Every woman who wears makeup should get this book! I took it to work with me one day and almost did'nt get it back. So many of my co-workers got helpful info. The author is very easy to understand and so well researched all her material. I was very impressed. I've also changed my own skincare regimen and have seen results. Her own products seem to be very consumer friendly especially to the pocketbook. Can't wait to see the new edition come out!
4,A Very Helpful Book,"Before Paula Begoun, women had very little information about the facts surrounding cosmetic ingredients and advertising. Her books were like a small revolution for women. As a teen, I had oily skin and acne and would use some of the harshest products on my skin. I had no idea that it was the products causing irritation. I've used her books ever since as a guideline to buying skincare products.Begoun's writing style is blunt and to the point, but I find that to be refreshing. She points out the lies, hype, and other tactics that cosmetic companies use to dupe otherwise intelligent women into buying their products, only to find later that it did not do what it was supposed to do. She also points out that expensive products don't necessarily mean better products, and sometimes they can be worse than drugstore products. Fashion types may not like Paula's books, but women who just want a product that works will be pleased to have a few good guidelines when shopping."
3,"Helpful informaton, but repetitive and poorly organized.","Generally I have found the book helpful, but it needs to be edited down! She is very repetitive. Also, some of the smiley face ratings conflict with her prose. For instance, she says in the Mary Kay intro section that ""lipsticks tend toward the greasy side."" Yet in the ratings list, where the reader could make quick and easy reference, she gives Mary Kay lipsticks the smiley face, compliments the product and doesn't say anything about being greasy. Which is it? Greasy or Good?"
1,OH MY GOSH,"How could she even give Noxzema a reputation as being ""irritating and one of the worst products"". This is one of the longest running facial cleasers on the market. Heck, my grandmother used it! Plus, it's the only skin wash that hasn't made my skin dry. And then she gives smiley faces to Neutrogena, which by the way made my skin break out in a bad rash. She neglects to highlight the important cosmetics. Seems to me she is just writing what works best for HER skin. She must remember that everyone's skin is different."
1,I hate to even give this book one star...,"Thank God she says this is the last book she'll write. Like many others mentioned, this book is mean-spirited and condescending. It is not accurate, and anyone who thinks that someone who has her own product line can write a book that isn't biased is exactly the gullible consumer who will buy this book. How insulting! Where is her integrity? Don't look for it in this book."
2,Too complicated,The original book was great. This one is too much. Finding anything takes more time than it's worth. Everything is recommended.
2,A skin care specialist's point of view!,"As a skin care specialst, this book is upsetting and frustrating. Paula, ""puts down"" many product lines and ingredients that are actually good for the skin, however she does have a couple of good points, and I agree when she says you don't have to spend a fortune to look great."
1,Please go to the cosmetic counter WITHOUT this book!,"I was extremely interested in this book because I work in the beauty industry and thought it would be a valuable resource. I was, however, extremely disappointed to find out that it was full of misinformation about products, especially what they were to be used for. This is more of a fifth grade slam book for the beauty industry than a resource for women interested in beauty. If I could give it no stars, I would."
2,Helpful ingredient lists but it's an AD in disguise!,"I was feeling all vindicated and savvy, reading about which ingredients/chemicals in name brand were effective, which were neutral ""fillers"", and which were actually irritating.But I was more irritated than the skin of a teenager with a Vasaline facial when I realized that Ms. Bogoun dedicated at least 1/3 of this book to plugging her stupid newsletter and even worse... HER OWN LINE OF COSMETICS!I wish I spent my $15 on something from Guerlein. It might not have stopped my wrinkles but it sure would have smelled better than this stinky deceptive book!"
4,excellent,I think she tells the truth and nothing but the truth. Someone might find hard to believe but if you follow her advice you will get results. Atleast I did. The book reduces a lot of confusion and makes you more knowledgeble about the products. Its clear that she has rated other products good and even though she supported sun protection she has not introduced in her makeup line. So you will have to buy from someone else if you want sun protection in your makeup. She has given a wide range of products to choose from with their prices and has broken down according to your skin type. Having academic degrees does not neccessarily means knowledge. Expereience counts too. The book is long but I guess if you were not interested in your skin care you will not read this in first place.
4,"A good book for the beauty industry consumer, BUT....","The former edition of this book does have some flaws. It is somewhat confusingly organized...I recommend reading it with some 3-M tapeflags on hand to mark your place! It would be nice to have a numbered ""best of category"" list. Also...many many new products come on the market each month, and many are discontinued...which can make info included in this book outdated or obsolete very quickly. It'd be nice if the book listed recommendations for product substitutes, say if a item was discontinued. To keep up on new products, you can subscribe to Paula's bimonthly newsletter for 25 bucks a year...but $25 can be steep in price. I've received two issues and not read any relevant info in them that I cared about...I will say though, that the info provided in Paula's book can be extremely helpful...and some can be opinionated. I find that she can be a tad bit paranoid when it comes to plant based ingredients and their effects"
2,Don't [not buy] products based on this book alone,"The author, Paula Begoun, does not go into great detail when explaining why some products are ""bad"", and why some are ""good"". At times, her reasons for discrediting a product are too vague to seriously take into consideration. Also, there are times in many of her reviews when she will give a product a good rating, but then counteract it with something negative to say about it. In my opinion, I don't think that this book is [good] simply because different people with have various reactions to various products. What works for some may not work for others. Bottom Line: The book gives useful information on the ingredients within the products, but the author is not very detailed and comes across as having a ""grudge"" on many of the product lines. Try the products for yourself through samples, and you be the judge!"
3,Don't Go the the Cosmetic Counter without Me,This edition was 2002 - somewhat outdated given the advances in cosmetic research and products.
2,Everyone's Skin is Different,"I'm so glad I read these reviews before I bought this book. As soon as I read that Paula is a proponent of mineral oils I knew her product recommendations would be irrelevent for me personally. I think Paula has some great advice as I've read other books by her, but she seems to have only one way of thinking. As an aesthetician with extremely sensitive skin that is prone to break outs, I've learned that what works for me doesn't work for everybody. The most baffling thing about skincare is that there is no universal treatment. EVERYONE'S SKIN IS DIFFERENT and reacts differently to ingredients. Even Dermatologists don't know everything there is to know about skin so how can someone who isn't a doctor have all of the answers? The simple fact is that you have to take any skin care advice with a grain of salt regardless of who you get your information from."
3,A little strict and not consistent,This book is well organized but it is very strict in many spots and not in others. I found the reviews of products inconsistent. I can't believe she has tested all of these products enough to sustain her harsh opinions.
5,This Book Was Great!,"Having oily sensitive skin prone to breakouts, I have constantly struggled to find the right products and couldn't understand why they didn't work. Not until I read Paula Begoun's book did I understand that most products for acne actually make it worse. I have seen a great improvement in my skin after using the products she recommends. I did not find her tone sarcastic, in fact I think it would be a dry book without a sense of humor. However, the Best Products chapter is not easy to use and it was time consuming to find the best products for acne prone skin. However the pull out section - Your Personalized Beauty Guide - is very handy when you are shopping."
4,Lighten up. It's just a reference.,"I believe Ms. Begoun had stated in every edition of this title that it's her OPINION, and the readers certainly do not have to agree with her. Well I don't always agree with her assessment, but this book has definitely helped me in saving some money by pointing out cheaper alternatives that work equally well. If the book has managed to done that, then to me it has served its purpose. And I also believed Ms. Begoun had said if a product works for you (regardless of her own opinion), stick with it by all means. Keep those two points in mind before reading this book. Remember: it's a guide/reference, not the law. Regarding her own skin care line--both me and my sister are currently using her products and they work incredibly well. But again, what works for one person may not work for the next. In no way did I feel this book is one big infomercial as a previous reader claimed. Your run-of-the-mill beauty magazine is a bigger plug of products than this will ever be."
2,Not the greatest,"This book is chock full of information and clearly very well-researched. The problem is that it is poorly organized. The book should put all mascara together, all cleansers together, all eye creams, lipsticks, etc. Instead, it places all brands in alphabetical order. Therefore, if you want to know which is the very best mascara to purchase, you have to look through pages and pages to get the info. It seems that it may be done that way purposely to assure that readers go through ever brand and all of their products. This is not the reference that I thought it would be."
1,Faulty comments,"Although Paula has done some good research, she puts some random comments into her reviews that are untrue.For example, it is clear that she does not like The Body Shop's shimmer cubes. She says that if you drop it it will easily break and that the product tends to flake.I have dropped the tester in the store. This means that it was open and i dropped the whole thing from the shelf, which was about 5 feet. The make-up did NOT crack. It even popped out of the container and the container's container (so there was cube of pure make-up) on the floor and did NOT crack.Furthermore, I have dry skin on my eyelids that flake. I use the shimmer cubes to STOP them from flaking. So I don't know where she gets the ""each shade is grainy and the shine tends to flake."" Or if she meant ""fade"" instead of ""flake"" then she should take course in English.Overall, I think it's important to not take everything she says seriously."
3,did not find it very helpful,"From all the reviews, I expected to see really unbiased research and recommendations. How disappointing to see pretty much all of the products listed there being not good enough for Paula, for various reasons. But her own stuff takes the cake, but of course. Such a big fat book and so useless, unless you want to stroke Paula's ego and buy her own products due to her own recommendation. It's not a book of research and truth. It's a book of self promotion."
2,Ho-hum!,I found this book un-impressive. I would not recommend wasting your money or time reading it. Purachase cosmetics that can be returned if you do not like them ~ do your own research.
3,"A Good read, but still chose for yourself","I have read sections of this book. As long as you take into consideration that it is based on an opinion, its a great book. I would like to note, that I have also tried Paula's Choice line of products and it seems that I did have a reaction. That said, please be aware, some people cant eat eggs because of alergies, but yet others can. As long as you don't think that this is a cure all, then your fine. If you find that you have a rash *** Discontinue USE of the PRODUCT*** they do have a money back guarrantee, so I do plan getting a refund on some of the products, I haven't decided about the others yet. I thought that this would help other people. Im sure that some items work wonders for other customers, I cant use this, or Noxema, breaks me out horribly, this one just gave me a rash."
4,Terrific book-- saves you money,"With so many skin care otions out there, books that really help you sort through the maze of products are invaluable. When you think about it, what you spend on a book like this one could save you ten times its price in money spent on products that are not helpful. THE SKIN TYPE SOLUTION by Dr. Leslie Baumann and this book are great together because this one reviews all products, and THE SKIN TYPE SOLUTION guides you to the right products for your skin type. Berween the two of them, they are all you really need."
2,"Okay for some, BUT.......","This book may be great for certain people and I did get a lot of help from the section on ingredients and possible irritants. BUT....when I tried her suggestion of Cetaphil and baking soda and then the dreaded hydrogen peroxide toner, it made my face raw, red, and eventually broken out. Her product reviews are not that great and can be confusing (I noticed some products that were either out of date or not actually in a line at all). I also didn't like the tone of the book in general (sarcasm) or the fact that she spends a lot of time promoting her own stuff. If she wants to be regarded as a true, unbiased, ""consumer guide"", she needs to stay out of the business."
4,"Very informative, saved me money, time and sorrow.",Quite an eye opener. She'll debunk the high prices and let you know what really works!
5,A money & time saver,"This is one of the best cosmetics books you can buy.It has saved me countless dollars on products I would of bought, yet be unsatisfied with"
3,Useful but boring,"The information is good, but the way of presenting it is cumbersome and less usable than I had hoped it would be. The author's visit on Dr. Oz was more promising than what the book delivered."
2,Organic??,"For several years Paula has done a great job sharing her ideas with us. I have found most helpful. When she would answer people on her website she would say that ""natural"" products are no better than synthetic. Now, she is selling a natural line of skin care on her website! I have always thought there were slots of unregulated chemicals in products... Now I check goodguide.com and skindeep.com and am shocked at all the toxins in most cosmetics and skin care! It may not matter to her, but it matters to me.. Health, Society and ecology are more important than the best products.... Especially cosmetics. And if she abhors animal testing, why is Olay, Covergirl, and even Cetaphil listed as ""the best""??"
5,You need this book!,I love this book. It saves me time and money. I used her first book and this one is even better. Every women needs it. I was spending way too much money on cosmetics and skin care and the products didn't work. Now my skin looks great and my pocket book is happy too.
3,Paula Begoun AKA Devil's Advocate,"There's already about 200+ reviews on *what* is inside this book, so I'm going to give my opinion and my opinion only. First, I like the fact that Ms. Begoun is against animal testing. The thing I didn't like is that she didn't even really seem to like the products that she gave a 'smiley' and a 'checkmark' for. There's those two icons for each product that Ms. Begoun liked a lot, but after the product listed she would usually have some mediocre review about and/or saying ""it's as good as anything out there"". So, I was left wondering what exactly was the best. In the back of the book there's about three pages of ""what's best"".. I did like that a lot."
1,Complete bias!,"Let me save you some time: Paula has something negative to say about every product on the market except for her own. I find that a lot of her information is suspect and some is just plain incorrect.In my opinion, she has no place critiquing other products while she is trying the schlep her own.If you are interested in the ingredients in products, buy Milady's skin care and cosmetic ingredients dictionary. It is educational, easy to understand, and impartial. It will be a better use of your money."
1,Didn't work for me,"When I first heard about this book I was really excited. I'd heard that some less expensive products were just as good as the expensive ones. So I read this book. (Thankfully I just checked it out from the library.) I tried some of the suggested less expensive products. But, I'm going back to Estee Lauder. The cheaper products resulted in break outs and skin that felt dry. Like lots of people , I got really excited when I was told that for less money I could get something just as good. But cosmetics are just like anything else--you get what you pay for."
2,"Not scientific, only anecdotal evidence to support claims.","I think that there is a lot of good information in the book. It might make a good starting place for make-up consumers. For better skincare advice, see a dermatologist. Cosmetics, by definition, cannot permanently alter your skin. Things that do that are classified as drugs and are regulated. I have met very helpful and informed cosmetics counter people and used to be one. While I admit there are people who just want you to spend your money on products you don't need, I managed to become the top seller at my counter by only selling people the products I thought would benefit them. If you aren't happy with the person helping you, get someone else. The woman writing this book sounds angry, and I have a hard time swallowing advice from an obviously biased person. But, I can sympathize with her frustration. And she's definately hit a nerve with a big portion of the country. Good luck, everyone!"
4,Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me,"I didn't need to purchase this book. It is great, but it is outdated. I bought the Revised edition at the same time, and found that is the only one necessary. They are very big!"
2,Lots of info.,"Read a bad spelling of Clinique in their as Cinique. Already emailed that info to them. Asked in that email a few questions. One was the Product by Elizabeth Arden was already reviewed in the 4th edition. But was canceled out in the next edition. WHY?!! I thought one edition was supposed to be an update of the other. With more products added in it, not dropped out! Found out she (Paula) does not review body products. (The new Shiseido silk sponge). Wonder Why. Would of given a 3 star rating! They did not have enough class to answer back completely in my prior email. Like they could of given the review of that soap! But to busy I guess! She also included in the book her own products! Wonder why she even bothers to rate the others, and not hers? Best to read up at the library, take notes their too. Much cheaper! Especially you are on a budget!"
3,Strangest thing...,"Try to get an idea about the book reading the readers reviews. The book either gets 5 or 1 stars . I have not yet decided on purchasing but something is very strange here... ( I gave 3 stars just to be fair , and be able to post)"
5,Don't go the the cosmetics counter without me,"I find Paula Begoun's book to be filled with very helpful tips and information on skin care, make-up, reviews and anti-aging. When I first received this fascinating book I could not put it down. It's a wonderful reference which every woman who cares about the way she looks should have. It would be a great gift as well. I plan to refer to Paula's book prior to purchasing make-up and skin care products. I highly recommend Don't Go To The Cosmetics Counter Without Me !"
1,If you loved her first book you'll hate this one!,"If you are expecting the type of information you got in Ms Begoun's first book, you want get it in this one.For instance, I used the BEST BUYS list in the first book extensively and found it to be reliable. This edition has thirty or so items in each category with no mention of the best prices. Also, in her first book I often disagreed with Ms. Begoun on products I have personally used as did many of the blind test groups. There are no test groups in this edition just facts, formulas and ingredients.I also found her own product line in the book a little too self promoting.Unless you are in need of a list of ingredients in cosmetics I can't see any point in this book as a reference."
3,Lethal Mercy,I have read almost all of Harry Kraus MD's books. This was my least favorite. It was most unbelievable and there just seemed to be too much jumping around from people to people as well as place in time. It took me sometime to read it due to that fact. I normally cannot put his books down.
3,Not just an introduction,"I purchased this book thinking it sounded like a solid introduction to logical thinking. I found the authors' use of biblical references distracting to what was presented as a purely logical discussion. There is no question that God and logic can be discussed and examined in the same context. In this book, however, the combination is at times cumbersome."
5,One of Only Two,"Truly philosophically minded introductions to Aristotelian logic (the other is Peter Kreeft's _Socratic Logic_). I now do work in advanced mathematical logic, but the good old syllogism is still the most useful logical tool on a daily basis. My favorite two parts of this book are the early parts on Logic and God. It should be required reading for modern Christians. Also, the chapter on Uncovering Logic in Literature is very very good. I have taught from this text in Classical High Schools and have found it ideally suited for that purpose. It also works very well for a self-taught course. There are answers to exercises in the back. I should add that the exercises are largely drawn from philosophy and theology which makes them much more interesting than conventional logic texts."
2,Compression workaround,I have to agree with the comments on video quality of these two features.I was able to display the image without the compression by setting my DVD player for a 16 x 9 aspect ratio on my standard 3 x 4 TV. Of course you will have to return the settings to their correct value before watching any other DVD.
2,Repetitive and lacking in art,"I read and enjoyed a some of the Uncle Wiggily stories as a child, so I've sought out most of them for my child. These are not among the best to get. Garis' story template is used repititively, to the point of predictable tedium. The tedium is not lessened by the lack of drawings. This is rather expensive, and the stories are downloadable for free on the web since they are now public domain."
2,Sizing wrong,"I usually wear a size 12 to 14 but I have a 38D bra size and often things are too small on top. I ordered a 1X and it was WAY too small for me in the bustline. The info on sizing is totally wrong. It does look cute and the lace is soft though. Sexy looking. Color is great. There is no support in the cups which are smallish, maybe for a B cup. The thong is one size fits all."
3,No support,"This is very cute but the bra part does not fit and provides no support. I guess since I wouldn't be parading around in it, it's not a big deal but don't expect much if you wear a D cup or higher."
4,An interesting read for those who love the sea !,"I must disagree with the earlier reviewers. While the book would have benefited from a more thorough editing and proofreading process, I nonetheless greatly enjoyed reading it. It appeared to be well researched and the author obviously has a passion for the subject. I found the Stevenson family fascinating. The descriptions of the building of the lighthouses, particularly the great ones; Eddystone, Bell Rock, and Skerryvore, imparted a sense of both the excitement in attempting such daunting projects and the tremendous difficulties that were overcome to build the structures. I also enjoyed the illustrations, but wish that more had been included. I would recommend this book to anyone having an interest in the history of lighthouses or maritime engineering."
5,Unfair Customer Reviews?,"The large number of very favorable editorial reviews ( by some of the most respected critics) confirm that this is an excellent piece of writing. Apparently,at least one edition lacked appropriate checking and editing. But these irritating deficiencies should not be allowed to degrade the average customer review to a level that turns away potential readers who would otherwise enjoy this excellent book."
1,Typos and mistakes galore! So how solid is the history?,"After visiting Scotland last summer, I was excited to find this book. The wild Scottish coast is an intriguing context for adventure, courage, and (here) amazing engineering achievement. However, the book is a huge disappointment. The story is potentially quite a compelling one, but the HUGE number of mistakes--both in the editing and proofreading and factually--detract to an overwhelming degree from one's possible enjoyment of the book. If this were a paper from one of my students, it would get about a C-. Given the number of mechanical errors in the book, one might be very skeptical about the historical facts, as well. And if it isn't good history, it sure doesn't cut it as decent fiction. If you want to read this one, check it out of the library. Don't waste your money on a flawed book."
2,Irritating typos spoil the reading quality,"A pity about all the typos - I agree with the other reviewers on that. I looked at the flyleaf to see if the author thanked anybody for proofing and editing - she didn't, and it shows, regrettably. This got a great review from the Sunday Times in England, they obviously had the better edition."
1,"boring, poor proofreading,so very disappointing!",I was not able to finish the book either(in reference to the first reviewer.)I just became so disgusted with the boring treatment of the material and the sloppy proofreading that I literally threw the book down;And I was so excited when I encountered the book and its description on Amazon.What a pity -the subject matter has such potential!
2,"""This is not intended..."" The author got that right!","The preface starts with ""This is not-nor was it ever intended to be- a definitive biography of the Lighthouse Stevensons."" So the author decided to concentrate on the years 1786-1890 and in the process shortchanged all the Stevensons. The author stated that to be comprehensive the writing would be ""futile"" and ""wearing."" The author makes the reader question, ""Why bother?"" A scattered summary of their various careers follows with a confusing look at the building of some of Scotland's most important lighthouses. As someone with an interest in lighthouses I was looking for ""comprehensive,"" not excuses.I also don't think I've ever seen this many typos in a book published by a major company."
5,So far so cool!,"My hubby wanted our already tough looking dog to look even tougher, and this is the ticket. It smells of that great leather smell right out of the box and fits our dog great- so the sizing is accurate. They shipped it well before the deadline, and it seems to be holding up well (dog has been wearing it for 3 weeks).Our dog does look tougher now :)"
3,Fun album,"This is basically Ronnie Earl and Duke Robillard jamming over basic Blues songs. A highlight is Mighty Sam McClain's vocals on ""A soul that's been abused."" As for the guitar work, there's a lot of repetitiveness and redundancy on both sides. The presence of the two single guitars is so overpowering, there are almost no real intense band moments on the CD. Both play their usual time-tested licks. Maybe the price you pay for success...getting lazier and not pushing the envelope of the genre anymore? We can still be grateful that fine Blues albums like this exist, but I expected more from two modern veterans of the Blues."
5,"If you like Blues Guitar, buy this CD","Ok, I love blues guitar playing and these guys are two of the best. Duke Robillard was one of the founders of Room Full Of Blues and and Ronnie Earl was their lead guitar player for a while after Duke left to go out on his own. They play together wonderfully. The recorded tone of their guitars is superb as is their choices of tunes to play. If you like blues guitar playing, but this CD. You will not be sorry. This is a great blues guitar album!"
3,Good Road Trip Music,"This was a nice CD - and since I am fan of both guitarists, I thought this would be a slam dunk...but...I dunno, most of the material here issafe, standard faire that seems to be a union of two leaders each saying ""No, after you""...good backround music, nothing memorable"
5,T-Bone's Spiritual Sons,"If you've ever liked the T-Bone Walker style, or drooled over the pure T-Bone licks that both Ronnie and Duke have graced us with over the years, ""Two Bones and a Pick"" is eight minutes of pure jump-blues-guitar-heaven. I can, and do listen to this for hours on end. If any two white guys have got that jump-blues-guitar-thang down, it's these two. T-Bone is grinning like a Cheshire cat."
4,Good stuff,First off; I really appreciate artists or labels that give you at least 60 minutes of play time and don't cut out lengthy guitar solos. This CD certainly delivers in this regard as Ronnie Earl and the Duke trade guitar jams in creative duets for a solid 70 plus minutes. This is a close 5 star recommendation but it isn't a classic and it isn't groundbreaking; although I would think some reviewers would seriously disagree with that point. It's just damn good music by two pros whose different styles compliment one another. Highly recommended.
2,despair despair despair,"I rushed to buy this book after the reviews in amazon.com. I must say I was not too impressed. Gilmore is an in-your-face writer and he holds nothing back, true. But I think he doth trieth too hard to shock and awe. After a while, it gets over-played. I am also not too impressed with the choice of stories. Eddie and Holmes -- ok. Barbara Payton -- ok. Then it begins to slip. By the time you get to Spade Cooley, you begin to wonder whether this was just a filler. Ahhhh!!!! No. Not too pleased."
4,"""The Way It Ought To Be! Mix It Up & Jam!""","After listening to the first two tracks (Ride & People), my frame of mind was ""Another Fundamental CD"".However, the rest of the album reminds me of the Puya I know from the very begining when they were known as 'Whisker Biscuit'.What's great about this band is they can play with anyone, and still receive a positive response from the audience!The music on this CD has a wide diversity of styles such as , various latin sounds, metal, fusion jazz, funk, hardcore, etc.,.My suggestion's to buy this CD, even if you live in a community within the Great Plains!While you're at it, you should hunt for their self-titled release ""Puya"", in which's on 'Noise Boyz' Records!That's all so purchase the ""Union"" CD now , or regret it later!"
4,The sound of Puerto Rican rage,"This band started in early 90's and i've been following the band since.I've got to say that this album has been a big evolution for the band and really blew my mind!The guys are better than ever, the sound is so bold, everything is perfect.This album is their best production to date.If you're into rage againt the machine's rapping and growling, pantera's killer riffs and soulfly's percussion aranges you gotta buy this cd right away 'cause it's better than all of them together!"
3,Excellent story line,"I purchased this book because it was chosen by my book club. Although it is not a book that I would have ordinarilly purchased, I did enjoy it. The constant foreign language was a bit disconcerting, but the story was excellent, and it will make for an interesting discussion next week. The characters were very well intermingled and the emotion contained in the novel was heart rending at times."
3,Anna Banti's version is better,"Although Artemisia Gentileschi was certainly unusual for her era, the character Vreeland gives her in this book feels too modern. A more interesting version of the life of Artemisia is the earlier book by Anna Banti, entitled Artemisia, and first published in Italian in 1947."
1,absolutely no passion,"I really though I would love this book, I love art, love the premise. I'm a voracious reader, but rarely have read a book as poor as this. I kept reading, since I wanted it to improve, but finally gave it up 3/4 through, just didn't care to continue The dialog is really, very poorly written; and the writing is in a very strangely detached style, the ""Passion"" in the title is never achieved. Last one from this author I'll read."
3,Okay,"I too wanted to love this book -- Artemisia Gentileschi is one of the most fascinating historical figures who is only recently getting ""her due."" Vreeland has written a decent enough book, but suffers from making her Renaissance era character into a modern soap opera-worthy vixen. I give this book 3 stars only because the author already had so much to work with....."
2,disappointing,"Having enjoyed the Girl in Hyacinth Blue, I was very interested in reading Susan Vreeland's new novel. I was, however, totally disappointed right from the beginning by the ""bodice-burner"" tone. I felt that all of her characters, except for Sister Graziela, were one-dimensional and for the most part, totally unlikeable. The descriptions of the painting processes and the paintings themselves are the only reasons I gave this book two stars instead of one."
5,great historical fiction,Highly recommended to the reader who appreciates a good story that incorporates art and history. The writing style keeps the readers attention.
2,Didn't like this at all.,Another book club book. We have an artist in our group that was dying to read this. She actually looked up and printed off copies of the paintings that were described in the book. Most of our book club liked this. I did not. It was very long and depressing. I appreciated the story and the struggles that the main character went through. I did not find this entertaining but more of an assignment type read.
3,Not bad,"Interesting story, not bad. Had some good parts. It was interesting to learn about her life [a fictitious account at that]."
3,Too Much Handwringing,"if you start a book with your main character being tortured by the Inquisition, there's not much to build to. The rest of the book was focused on how tough it was for a man to get ahead in the art world of the Renaissance, so our girl was stressing on how much harder it was for her. Then her daughter makes a fabulous marriage match so she'll never have to depend on her painting to put food on the table like her mother did and Artemisia makes out like the daughter is on her way to the Inquisition. Then there's a bit with her dad who was the reason she was tortured by the Inquisition and I couldn't believe any of it would actually happen. Completely unsatisfying for me."
5,A Picture's Worth 1000 Words - but this book is priceless!,"When I attended the Center for Creative Studies in Detroit, my favorite times where spent exploring the Detroit Institute of Arts. One semester I took a class on Women Artists and I clearly remember how captivated I was by the story of Artemesia Gentileschi. She was such a strong and heroic woman and immensely talent artist. She was so far ahead of her time. I was forever moved when I visited the DIA and saw her masterpiece ""Judith and Maidservant with the Head of Holofernes"". Now, almost twenty years later, I discover this book, which describes not just Artemesia's life, but tells me exactly what went into one of my favorite masterpieces! Susan Vreeland has done an incredible job of painting a picture of another age. Her words depict the life of this incredible woman artist in the same way that Artemsia captured essence the subjects of her artwork."
2,Sadly Disappointing,Such a letdown after Girl in Hyacinth Blue. This book has none of Girl's poetry or soul. For a better written depiction of Artemisia try Alexandra Lapierre. And no characterization of Galileo can top Sobel. It seems as if Vreeland was writing to make a deadline or fulfill a contract for that critical second book. It's not written from the heart.
1,Awful,"First let me say I loved Girl In Hyacinth Blue and was eagerly awaiting Susan Vreeland's next novel. The Passion of Artemisia was enormously disappointing. The writing was poor, the plot was trite and the book was overflowing with present day political correctness. I know that this was loosely based on fact but it could have been much better. I am tired of books with heroine as victim. The author took lots of liberties with the truth. According to one source I read the real Artemisia had sons yet to make this a feminist novel you cant have her having a positive relationship with a male. I am sick of stories of women done wrong by men.Perhaps it is time for women to grow up."
4,An Enjoyable Story,"I thoroughly enjoyed following Artemisia throughout this story. The beginning of the story has some strong and painful images which bond the reader to this young woman. I've enjoyed both this story and Susan Vreeland's ""Girl in Hyacinth Blue"". I've also placed an order for the soon to be released large print version of this book for an elderly relative."
5,Absolutely wonderful!,"What a well researched and written book. I truly enjoyed the art walks through Rome and Florence. It brought back many memories of the cities. Growing up in Europe, I had the pleasure of visiting Florence several times before the flood in the sixties and I lived in Rome for a year too."
1,"Poor Research, inaccurate, doesn't deserve even 1 star","While in the Uffizi in Florence this May, I decided to purchase this book after viewing Artemisia Gentileschi's paintings that the museum. My undergraduate career was focused in Art History and concentrated in Italian Renaissance works, so I am well knowledgeable about Artemisia and her influences. I when in to the book energized because from my research Artemisia's life is an amazing story for women. However, the lack of plot and inaccurate information left the last 300 pages painful to read, but I hoped each chapter would meet my expectations.Save your time and money, better artistic reads are ""The DaVinic Code"" or ""M; The Life of Caravaggio"""
4,very enjoyable read,"Susan Vreeland paints a detailed picture of some of the urban and artistic aspects the seventeenth century Italy. I very much enjoyed the art historical details of the making of pigments, hiring the models, the artistic rivalry and the careful look at some of the contemporary painting and sculpture in Rome, Florence and Genoa. Some of the characters are well sketched and ring very true, especially Artemesia's daughter. Enjoy it. A few illustrations would have been a plus."
2,No Meat,"Although this novel is about a fascinating woman in history who shone among the women of her generation, this book lacks a richness in character development."
5,Art and Intrigue,"This intriguing novel brings to life Artemisia Gentileschi's tragic ordeal and leaves us reeling at the injustice. The artistry with which Vreeland melds the real-life tragedy with the rage of Artemisia's incomparable ""Judith"" spins a gripping, fascinating story.Despite Artemesia's anachronistically feminist ideas (as depicted in this novel) her unjust plight can't fail to enlist the reader's sympathies and outrage. Her quest for wholeness sweeps us along in this enthralling tale of art and passion.Sarah Bruce KellyAuthor of THE RED PRIEST'S ANNINA"
5,Captivating!,"I had studied Artemisia in a Women's Art History class in college, so I had some idea about her biography. And I think Vreeland did an amazing job of stringing out a believable tale of what her life was really like. This book really captured the essence of ""Judith"" and offered a believable account of what Artemisia must have been thinking when she painted it. It's the only Susan Vreeland book I've read (and the least known, unfortunately!), and I can't wait to read another! I couldn't put this one down!"
4,Great approach to Artemesia Gentileschi (sp?),"I much prefered this novel to the Girl In Hyacinth Blue, though I stayed up all night reading it, too. I had seen a movie about Artemesia, and had learned a bit more about her through articles and my Italian study, so I really enjoyed this novel version of her life. Of course, having studied Italian, there are some things in the book that are implausible, but fun.. the hubby going to see the 'calcio', an important part of non-high Italian culture today, but 200+ years before the game was invented. Good to have a sense of humor about things."
2,"Good writing, weak history","Vreeland's writing captures the characters and involves the reader with them. I enjoyed reading this book, but was stunned at the contradiction to the reality of Artemesia's life. Although fictionalized biography by definition takes liberties with the subject's life, it makes no sense for example: 1) to portray Artemesia with only one child (she had 4), 2) to portray that daughter with no interest in painting (her surviving daughter was a painter), 3) to have Artemesia return to Rome alone with her daughter (in reality she returned with her husband), 4) to portray Artemesia's marriage as breaking up much earlier than it did in reality. To me these distortions change so much about Artemesia that the book becomes pointless. It puzzles me because Vreeland is a good enough writer to be able to carry a story without contracting essential facts."
1,A disappointment,"I picked up this book because I had so enjoyed Alexandra LaPierre's novel on the same subject. The book had also received some excellent reviews. However, I was really disappointed. First, the language is trite and Artemisia speaks in cliches. I felt like the narrator was speaking to me on a ninth grade level, which I didn't like. I'm amazed that I finished the novel.I think more importantly, though, the character of Artemisia really irritated me. Here is this woman who really triumphed over adversity to be a female painter in a time when women didn't do anything besides birth children. However, she plays the helpless victim throughout the novel, and, rather than foster an environment in which her daugher can make her own decisions, she forces the daughter to paint.The novel is also riddled with historical inaccuracies. After doing some research on Artemisia, these inaccuracies really irked me."
3,"Excellent Beginning, Disappointing Ending","This novel starts out wonderfully and I found it difficult to put it down. The language was beautiful and the story intriguing. Unfortunately, after about halfway through, the story began to decline. Each chapter took place in a different city, with an unsatisfying ""briefing,"" and certain subplots were dropped without explanation. Near the end, Artemisia's speech became clichéd and tiring.Aside from these complaints, I did enjoy the novel. I give it a B and if possible, I would give 3.5 stars."
4,A well-constructed mystery.,"This is one of Christie's most interesting novels. Don't be surprised if you can't put it down!! You will be quite surprised at the ending and kicking yourself for not guessing whodunit! My hint to you--listen to the description Christie gives about the mind of a murderer, and then try to pick which character matches."
3,Ending was obvious,"I love Agatha Christie, but this was not her best work. It is a fantastic murder mystery, but not by the standards of Christie's other books. The ""surprise"" ending on this one wasn't so surprising. The clues were not as skillfully hidden in plain sight as her other works, and the foreshadowing in the form of lessons by the Scotland Yard detective/main character's father is not exactly subtle-- it just gives everything away."
5,An excenllent book to read.,"This is an excellent book about a clueless crime. I think it is special because, the detectives aren not the same. Although it is a little bit large story and it hasn not the clues that I wished. But I think it is one of her best stories."
2,"Good Idea: Dissapointing, However.","A single act of murder and a ""who-did-it"" plot creates 200 pages of questioning, only to find the murderer is the most unlikely person of them all. Christie should have developed the characters Charles and Sophia more; it was dissapointing to learn almost nothing about them and what happens to them after the murder is solved."
2,Tedious Christie,"This Christie novel doesn't quite deliver the goods. It's the usual savoir faire: a crumbling family's patriarch is murdered, and his significantly-younger trophy wife is thought to be his killer. The dysfunctional Leonides family thinks the victim's wife might be carrying-on an affair with the live-in tutor. There's plenty of police talk and not nearly enough character development. In fact, one wishes the characters weren't so ""Christie,"" i.e., familar, predictable, etc. Despite a mildly intriguing denouement (which, also, was somewhat predictable), Crooked House lacks fresh characters and gripping dialogue, which makes it a tedious read."
3,Crooked House,"In this stock account of the poisoning of a Greek tycoon by a close family member, there is far more conversation than deduction, far more discovery of possible motive than ratiocination. Indeed, the identity of the psychologically abnormal murderer dawns on the narrator-hero only after the murderer's diary falls into his hands. Not one of Christie's best."
4,Crooked House,"I love Agatha Christie, I own nearly all her books, and have read them all at least twice!! The fact that I figured out close to the end what was going on and guessed the murderer in no way stopped me enjoying the story, I love Agatha Christies style and her charactors and this was a really great read!!! I think my guessing is only because I have read all her books to death (c;"
3,"Vintage Christie, Again!",This is a pretty decent Christie novel. The connections it forces a reader to make in order to solve the crime are entertaining.
5,Do not read the other reviews please.,"Sorry but reading the other reviews slightly ruined this book for me. They give too many hints (they seem subtle but once you get your hands on the book the answer is obvious). Anyway, I was nonetheless satisfied with this book and agree that is one of Dame Christie's must-reads. Read it."
4,Fitted sheet is large,"I love the flannel, but the fitted sheet seems to me would nearly fit a queen sized bed. (Hence, 4 stars instead of 5) I guess it is better to err being too big rather than too small! I've ordered a couple of the duvet covers, pillow cases and shams - so I'm a fan of this flannel and like the pink and white. And the price - unbeatable!!"
4,Live Dacca!,"A strong live record, though it probably draws a bit too much from the Brian Johnson era (or, to say it better, not enough from the Bon Scott era. This album is offers up a strong contrast with AC/DC's first live album, If You Want Blood, You've Got It, and it's clear that the transition from gritty, dirty, barroom rock n' roll to a more grandiose, occasionally less bluesy style, has been completed. While my preference lies with the former, I'm not one to argue that there's only one proper AC/DC, and this is a nice offering of mostly later material."
5,great cd,"couldn't wait to get this cd, just love it! I have it in my vehicle so can listen to it all the time."
3,Loud and loud...an AC/DC concert,"Many complain about who they are, but you know what you will get with AC/DC...loud, bangin metal rock and that is ok for the heavy metal aficiondo...Rock On"
4,"Very pleased with this site, have already bought again","All good here, have bought again a few times more & will be again after this purchase, postages prices could be a little bit less damaging"
1,Wrong item sent,I got Canned Heat's UNcanned CD. I ordered AC/DC LIVE Let me know and it'll be sent back as I have this CD already and dont need another I want the ordered CDthanks dave
1,Who screwed this up?,"I love AC/DC. I love all of these songs. I love their other live one (if you want blood). But these are the worst versions of these songs I've ever heard except for TNT. Where on earth is the crowd - I thought they were live? Johnson's vocals are too much in the foreground and overshadow the music and that makes no sense to me. AC/DC is about great guitar riffs, the lyrics are secondary. No other AC/DC album allows the vocals to dominate the disk, the vocals definitely don't dominate their live shows, so why do they on this disk? Who allowed what should have been the greatest live album of all time to get screwed up like this?"
4,Strong collection!,"This is the edition to get, with 23 songs and two cd's, not the normal edition with one CD.AC/DC is in top form here, their sound is strong. I'd like to make a comment to reviewer Tara Street. This is not Phil Rudd's drumming here. THe drummer here is Chris Slade, who by the way can blow Phil Rudd out of the water, and that's one of the reasons the AC/DC sound here is so improved.Anyway, it has a few flaws. It does not say where each of the songs was recorded."
3,A Pretty Good Live Album,"This is a pretty good live CD. It has most of their good songs. The one thing I don't like that much about this CD is the vocals aren't great. I think it's a cool album, but I deffinatley preffer the studio versions of the songs."
4,AC/DC LIVE,This is great CD. It is their ONLY CD that has Thunderstruck AND TNT on it. Also Who Made Who......great song! My husband is the AC/DC fan and he loves the whole album.
2,What the hell?,"Up until this point, I had the 1 CD version, which was good. I've been wanting the 2 CD version for a long time and finally the price drops at Wal Mart and I get it. HOWEVER, it seems on this version all of the songs fade out at the end, wha the hell were they thinking there? Its a live album, I wanna hear a show, now the songs... so that little fact makes the entire album unlistenable to me... moron move.Otherwise, the songs are high energy and great, its that little flaw that makes me less then likley i'll ever want to listen to it."
4,One of the best live CD ever!,I listen to a lot of different types of music and I have to say this live cd is one of the best. It keeps the listener energized and enjoying the different song from older cds to there newer ones when it came out.
3,not bad,I wish i waited for it to hit itunes. I realiy only purchased for 3 songs. not a bad collection though
5,"it's live ac/dc, at it's best","These discs cover a lot of the hits, and what's more to say, its AC/DC!!!!!!for those about to rock, i salute you"
3,Disappointed in this one,"I expected this to be a great live album, but there's definitely something lacking. The performances are a bit lazy--just phoned-in, going-through the motions type stuff, completelylacking in vitality. These are great songs, of course, but they're performed exactly the same way as on the albums (some with a faster beat)and there's really no reason to own them over the originals; in fact, just get those instead. Be sure to listen to several tracks first if you're interested in buying."
3,highway to hells a great version,I have heard Highway to Hell for 30 seconds to see if it was good as the Bon version. Pretty Good. I want this CD.
2,"This should be labled ""Dead"" not ""Live""","The recording is weak and the performance wanting. I expected the music to resemble the performances from their original sound tracks....I was disappointed. On a good note, the CD makes a wonderful disk to play ""fetch"" with my dog ;-)"
1,Decent riffs on Jailbreak the rest sucks.,"The vocals are terrible, brian johnson cannot sing live to save his life. The guitar riffs on Jailbreak were ok the rest is an album I continously skip through."
5,AC/DC = T.N.T.,"Truly the best of AC/DC. A must have for all AC/DC fan, or a fan of the TRUE heavy metal of that time(ie. Metallica, Guns'n Roses)It is a song from many different concerts, thrown together. Including songs like ""BACK IN BLACK"" (my favorite) ""DIRTY DEEDS"" ""HIGHWAY TO HELL"" and ""T.N.T."". A truly great CD by the band. AC/DC, I salute you!"
2,Lots of good advice coupled with some terrible advice,"My husband and I read this book for a bible study class and I really liked what I read. However, there were some chapters that were left out which I later read on my own. Of some of the terrible advice in this book, Wangerin advises cheating spouses, rather than confess to their spouse, to confess to a responsible, trustworthy Christian, in order to save the spouse from hurt. Also, he advises spouses who are beaten by their spouses to give their spouses several chances to stop abusing before kicking them out. Even then, he advises them to still give them another chance."
5,Start Here!,"In the years leading up to marriage, and during the ten years I've been married, I've read MANY marriage books. My reading has not been sparked by any particular crisis, but rather, by a desire to make our marriage better. This book is the best! Many Christian marriage books paint the picture that the author has a perfect marriage. Wangerin puts away any such pretense and shows us his soul. In the process, we learn about ourselves. I encourage any couple to read this book, whether things are great, or heading toward divorce. Thank you to Wangerin for writing this book!"
1,Avoid - 90 ft not 100ft,"As many others have discovered, reels are significantly short of 100ft. In this day and age that is unacceptable - look elsewhere."
2,"Another ""Shorted"" Customer","Ordered this to build some speaker cables for our church monitors. Fairly good wire, good guage (fyi - it is very close to actually being 12 gauge, which surprised me). Holds up to solder well. BUT...it is NOT 100' of cable. As with others, we are 10 feet short of 100'.I had red the reviews, and took a chance because we needed clear cable that would ""hide"" well in the Sanctuary. Cable carries voltage well, little resistance change, pushing 4 ohm with no problem or heat buildup. Given all this - I have to ask...why are you shorting us 10 feet in cable? If you had advertized this as 90' - I would still have purcahsed it."
1,Stolen money,"I read some reviews before choosing this product. Some people mentioned that they received less feet on the roll. Sure enough, I bought 100' of cable and I got a 90' roll. What a crook company!!!! don't buy this product."
2,89 feet,"For some reason I expected them to have sorted this issue. As of April 2009, still receiving short rolls - mine was 89 feet at best. Also be aware that one of the conductors is aluminum, not copper."
1,Sending it back,"I ordered the Metra label wire and was sent this, which I gather is also made by Metra. I can tell it's cheap compared to the Monoprice wire I used for 3 HT speakers before running out of a 100 ft. spool. I can't strip away the plastic cover without breaking strands of wire - very thin and brittle. This was easy to do with the Monoprice. Clearly a difference in quality. Almost doesn't look like 12 gauge. Surprised, because Amazon has high standards and I trust the brands they sell even when I'm not familiar with them."
2,less than 100',"The shipping is real quick. I got it in 4 days. Thanks for Amazon. But for the wire, I only can give 3 stars. This is not a 100' wire. 10ft shorter! I don't think that is acceptable. They cheat on customer. Now I have to buy another set. If you can avoid this product."
4,Nice product,"I received the order in a timely manner and it works great. I couldn't believe the difference in loss between the 16gauge I had and this 12gauge. There was so much more loss with my 16gauge it was ridiculous. The only problem with this that caused me not to rate it a 5 was the fact that the spool wasn't 100ft. long as advertised. I measured out my room and I needed 2 41ft. runs for my back speakers. This was after I added 15% for give and play. I measured the distance down from my receiver to the floor, around every nook and cranny along my wall and up the stand for the speaker itself. So I figured I'd cut the wire exactly in half and have 2 50ft. runs and I'd coil the excess in back of something like my couch. The run just made it which I thought was weird. So I measured its length and it was only 40ft. So I ended up only getting about 80ft out of the 100ft I should have. Otherwise the speaker wire works great."
3,Great Speaker Wire but Insufficient Length,I have to agree with a few of the other reviewers here. The wire is excellent quality but the spools are less than the stated 100 feet by as much as 10 percent.
1,"very bad, rip you off","after review all of negative feed back about this company i thought give them i try if they improve their service but after got the cable today, i open and Measure right away , guess what ? it only 85ft instead of a 100 ft. Stay away from this company, they try to rip you off with this"
3,Not 100 ft as claimed,"Just got it delivered today. Curious by comments from many others, I measured its length. And here it is again, it's only 91.5 ft. It's not a big deal for me as I do not need all 100' and money-wise, it represents like <$3. However, the feeling that we get systematically cheated by Raptor makes me mad and that's why I gave it a rating of 3. If you do need 100', don't buy this."
1,Junk,"I used this to replace existing wire to extend the length. Parts of the wire reduced the sound. This is junk, poor quality. I would buy another brand."
3,11 feet short,I read reveiws by other customers that said this item is shipped with less than 100 feet of wire. I purchased it anyway because I only needed 85 feet. I measured the spool when I opened it. It was only 89 feet long.
3,"Good quality wire but, as other reviewers mentioned, the spool was short !!!","Very good quality wire...However the spool I had received was short 13 feet ;-( So, instead of 100 I only received 87 feet on the spool.Luckily for me, I only needed about 75 feet so it did not mess up my intallation job.To Amazon's credit, they handled the incident very well: they credited my account for the value of the missing wire, approx. $5.00.Amazon.com are the best !!!! :-)"
2,12' short wire,"I bought this 100' wire two rolls one is 12' short & another one 13' short. So totally I lost 25' wires from both rolls, feels kind of cheating.Quality wise no problem."
4,"Copper is expensive, this is a decent deal","If you need heavy speaker wire for a long run or for a powerful system, this 12g wire is very good. For most systems, 18g would probably be fine.No problem with short lengths or anything.Best price I've found. (Alas, copper has skyrocketed in price in the last few years.)"
3,"Good wire, BAD seller ANTOnline","I've not had a chance to use the wire. I had to return it. I ordered 100' but received only 87'. I ordered it from ANTOnline. It was my mistake to choose this seller. Their customer service is arrogant and non-cooperative. Folks, read other reviews before place your order with ANTOnline. I am not the only one got short wires from them."
1,If I'd wanted shorter wire...,Both 100' spools of this wire came in TWO pieces.I discovered that I'd have to splice it halfway through a difficult install. URHHHH!!!! Avoid these problems by buying other vendor's products.
1,Don't buy this if you need 100 ft,"I thought maybe with all of the complaints about short rolls the supplier would have fixed the problem, but they haven't. The roll I bought was only 89 ft long. It wouldn't have bothered me if that would have been enough, but I really needed all 100 ft. I was only able to hook up 4 out of five speakers, and now I need to find another 10 ft of wire somewhere and wait a few more days to enjoy my surround sound system."
5,Good sound cable,"Got 3 of these, so about 300 feet in total. Each roll had a 100 feet as describe. Not sure why other review said in came in two pieces, but my only have one 100 feet cable per roll. Very happy. One side is copper and the other is silver."
1,frustrating beyond words,"I thought this book would be a good basic cookbook, but I am disappointed in the poor quality of the recipes. For example, I started reading in the Bread section, and in 25 recipes, I found 24 typographical errors or omissions (like a recipe for whole wheat bread that doesn't tell you how much whole wheat flour to use, and a refrigerator roll recipe where you are never told to put the dough into the frig). If you are an experienced cook, you will probably do OK with this book using trial and error, but if you are inexperienced, it is frustrating beyond words."
1,Buy another book - not this one,"Being new to breakmaking, I was excited to purchase this book so that I could begin making bread from my food storage. It doesn't appear that any of the recipes were tested because if you try and make the 100% Honey Wheat Bread - trust me, it doesn't work. I even enlisted an expert baker and she said there is no way this recipe would work as written. She even tried to rework this recipe with disappointing results. Makes me wonder if any of the recipes are worth even trying. Nothing worse than hoping for a wonderful outcome only to throw it in the trash. Which by the way is where this book is going to go. My advise is to ask a friend what cookbook they use and then buy that book. NOT this one. My guess is the author just wanted another cookbook under her belt and didn't care if any of the recipes worked."
1,I DO NOT recommend this book!!,"Yes- I agree- the recipes are, well, yuck! I saw the ""cheese"" recipe posted in several NG's-so I bought the book, and tried out this fantastic recipe. The cat wouldn't even eat it."
5,Cookin' with Home Storage,"Cookin' with Home Storage....is a must have book for the kitchens of America. This author is very knowledgeable in giving her readers information on what kind of foods to store, how to store and prepare them. People reading this series of books will not be standing in breadlines in the future. Buy this book and learn how not to go hungry.Sincerely,D.M. Simonds[...]"
5,Cookin with Home Storage,Book was very helpful made my wife and I realize that we didnt have no where near enough in our storage
3,"Pretty good recipes, too heavy on the Mormons...","While I enjoyed the recipes in the book, and feel it is a pretty good reference for cooking with your long term storage supplies, the heavy and constant reference to everything Mormon was fatiguing..."
5,The joys of camping with Polkaroo from Superior Home Video,This is a great video. Polkaroo's Day Camp is all about learning the joys of camping and making friends! Polkaroo discovers how important trees are to the environment and much more! This 60 minute video is from the Emmy Award winning producers at TV Ontario. superiorvideo.com
5,bought used,"the book is in perfect shape and I'm really impressed with the writing so far from a young soldier participating in a guerrilla movement .... exactly what I had hoped for, with the interest I have developed in this was"
3,Wish I had the original,"As a student of military history Reitz's book is well worth the read. However, the current copy was reprinted by [...] or some such place that obviously does not have a proof reader or editor on staff. In many places they made up new words to be inserted in place of the correct word. This occurs nearly every other page. In many cases these obscure words totally change the meaning of the paragraph. I have read the original and it does not contain such errors."
3,"Great Memoire, Terrible Proofreading","Deneys Reitz's memoire of the Second Boer War is a Classic and has been since its publication. My only problem is that this 2008 edition by CruGuru contains examples of some of the sloppiest proofreading/printing I have ever seen. Misspelled words are frequent and completely wrong words substituted are even more frequent.""Commando"", which contains little strategy but a great deal of human reaction to close combat, can be read and enjoyed by anyone. But buy an edition from a different publisher."
3,Losing her way,"Here is Dana`s 2nd single-- Rain.What can I say about it...it`s lose the feeling of her first great song`thinking over`...the rhyme is quiet strong, her voice is quiet hard...just give me the feeling of Ceilin Dior or Faith Hill... However, in this singel,there is a beautiful song called `Don`t Leave Me Now`,I can feel the soft and comfortable paino again,even it seems like Norah`s music... anyway, i love it..."
2,I didn't really care for this bag.,"I bought this item and felt ripped off. You don't get what you pay for. A couple of days later, I was on ebay and saw these really cool cases by this place called the Ultimate Case Company. They have some really neat designs. I bought one of them and I love it. just go here and you will see.[...]."
4,Good Introductory Text,"This book was written in simple English and easy to understand and a good introductory text to parliamentary procedure. Since it is an introductory book, one may not find the information or details required on some topics. After reading this book, if you want for more information, then go and buy Roberts' Rules of Order Newly Revised (9th Edition, 1990), the source of this book."
2,Roberts Rules in Plain English,"The book is a decent primer and is certainly more readable than Robert's original book. Of course the original and all of its editions remain an example of very incomprehensible and convoluted language even for its era. However, I have to handle large meetings of very strong-willed, intelligent people, so I found the ""Plain English"" book not very useful. I need to know the details and complexities of handling important meetings so that I make the right decisions. I will stick with the more sophisticated texts."
4,A great introduction,"A gentle introduction for people just starting out with parliamentary procedure.Contains great examples of how to run meetings and includes good advice for beginning chairman, all from an accomplished professional parliamentarian. For example, Zimmerman recommends using unanimous consent whenever possible to expidite business, and gives concrete examples on how to do this.You will probably eventually want to buy the full ""Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised"" to complete your study of parliamentary procedure. If you read Zimmerman first, RONR will be alot easier to digest. On the other hand, you may not need RONR, as all the most commonly encountered rules are covered quite well in Zimmerman. Sure, if you run into disciplinary problems, or want more details about how to write bylaws, you will need to look in RONR, but for the day to day running of most club/association/church meetings Zimmerman's book is a great guide."
5,Exactly what I needed.,"I wanted a simple and straightforward explanation of the basics, and this book delivered. It's an easy read, and will be invaluable as a reference in the future."
5,Wonderul it's a book that everyone can understand.,"This book teaches you how to run a meeting really well. Everyone can understand this book with its graphs, and agendas. With out this book I can be a good Chairperson of my group and I am not a lawyer I am a regular person who knows this book is great! This book shows how to be a good leader in life and mostly in meetings."
1,Robert's Rules in Plain English,"I threw this book out. If you are serious about learning how to run a meeting using Robert's Rules, this book will not meet your needs. It was too simple, too general and just too lacking of concrete information."
3,Roberts Rules made easy,I found the book as represented and easy to read and it has all the simple answers that you might need quickly. Reading the full Roberts Rules of Order revised can take time this makes it easy to pick out the simple explanation and answers. Nice to take to the meetings for quick reference.
5,roberts rules,I am excited and glad to have this book in plain english. I know it will make meetings run smoothly.
5,Very good reference book,This book is a good reference book on Robert's Rules. The book makes the Robert's Rules easy to understand. and use.
3,Lack of specifications,"easy to install, very stylish, however it is not suitable for proshield helmet device.nice element to have in stock"
3,ok shield,"Works great for its intended use, will not work if helmet has side plates on shield, other than that its just fine. Would buy again, but i stopped wearing full face helmets. To dangerous haha."
5,IN LOVE,This Shield is great. havent had any problems with it. it did fall from about 4 feet and didnt scratch or anything so far so good. I wouldnt recomend night riding with this on but I have been stuck with it one time and it was not awfully bad would have thought it would have been way worse. I clean my visors all the time with the Invisible glass stuff and they are clear as day all the time.
2,What happend with Umberto?,"I have read most of Umberto's books whom I found to be one of the best writers of his time. Nevertheless, Baudolino and this book are in my opinion not even close to his higher standard.The mysterious flame of queen loana, lacks any sort of emotion, is boring, so boring you end up counting the pages to the end.If you are into comics, WW2, old book names and weird old music titles you might be interested on a 100 pages of it...there is no mistery so do not get your hopes up....simply a flat boring book!"
2,self-indulgent navel-gazing,"Cut about 150 pages and this would be an interesting read.Eco uses a book collector's failed memory as an opportunity to explore what it was like to live as a young boy in WWII Italy. Of itself, that sounded like an interesting topic.What it turns into, however, is mind-numbing cataloguing of song lyrics, books, comic books, newspapers, etc. Where one or two examples might have been interesting, Eco gives us dozens. Yawn.I'm a huge Eco fan, but don't waste your time here: Foucault's Pendulum , and The Name of the Rose are masterful. Even The Island of the Day Before, not his best work, is more worth the effort."
1,Unreadable,"I appreciate other reviewers' positive comments and ratings, since I appreciate Eco's technical skills and erudition. Further, Name of the Rose is still one of the most enjoyable and well written thrillers I have ever read. Unfortunately, I just couldn't keep plowing through page after page of reminiscence over obscure comic book or other literary references. I suspect those readers able to do so eventually were rewarded, but after the 50th such page I simple found the book unreadable and quit. I'll have to wait for the next Eco book for something more accessible and conventional."
2,Didn't finish the book...,"I made it to page 150 before I decided to give up on ""The Mysterious Flame."" I thought the book had a lot of potential as a mystery novel without all the cliche and overwrought plot. Instead what I got was a mumbling main character who never remembers anything of importance and asks himself the same questions over and over: Was this from my childhood? Did I make this memory up? Am I imagining a past for myself?Interspersed between the redundant self-doubt were descriptions of various toys, books, and pieces of art, most of which have pictures in the novel. Nothing much interesting about the descriptions; I could have just looked up the art on the internet if I were interested.Nothing wrong with the prose--Eco knows his words. Just a boring, boring story."
2,Boring and disapointing,"Like many other Eco fans I keep looking for books of at least the same quality as the Name of the Rose.The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana is rather disapointing, except the first third which is well written and promising.Unless you are a fan of Ialian interbellic media you will find a lot of boring information and the rest is not so satisfying either."
3,"Nostalgic, but plodding","I was just going to listen to the audio version, but quickly got lost in the foreign words and train of thought. Also the pace - I read much faster than the tape speaks. But, a word to the wise - don't just listen to the audio. Not too far along,I purchased the hardcover copy of the book. I was so surprised to see all the graphics included which add greatly to the text and follow it closely. Either read it or do both as I did, but do not do just the audio alone. I'll let the rest of the reviews speak for the content and readibility. Umberto Eco is just not my cup of tea."
2,Rather disapointing,"Although it wasn't 100% uninteresting, I found it, on the whole, very boring. Picture this: a 60 year old intellectual wakes up from a coma with no memories of his past. In order to retrieve this memories, he goes into an excruciatingly detailed account of every book, magazine and comic strip he ever read in his life.Compensated by one moving episode from his childhood, I found the setting, the subject and the personality of the main character irrelevant and definetly lacking in the excitement and the depth of the other Umberto Eco's books I have read.--Written By Mary Camarena"
1,Not his best work,"I loved the Name of the Rose and Foucault's Pendulum - since then, Eco's storytelling has gone downhill. I really like the concept of Flame. Man loses memory and tries to regain it by returning to his childhood home, rereading formative books from his past. But the payoff here is terrible - the resolution meaningless and uninteresting. OK - I get the point - life is like that - but the book is simply a waste of time."
1,The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana,"As an Eco fan, I could not wait to read his latest novel. Sadly, I was deeply disappointed by this pompous, self-indulgent, virtually unreadable monster. The cultural and literary references are obscure and incomprehensible unless you are a 70-something Italian librarian."
3,"not much story, gets kind of tedious","i am sorry, but i did not enjoy this book. the book starts out strong, sets up the plot, but then the book becomes more of a list of old books, old magazines, old records. it becomes a nice reminiscence of nostalgia, but loses the story. i understand the story is told through nostalgia, but the story part becomes thin. the pictures of the old time magazines and such are a nice touch, but overall, i would rather get the book from the library than actually buy it, just so i wouldn't feel bad about not keeping it. there are better books out there that are more worth your time."
1,First 1/3 is thought provoking...,"but the second third is tediously repetitive unless you're fascinated by fifty year old Italian comics, and the last third is little more than 150 pages of cud chewing. Kind of like that guy I met in a pub the other day whose self-absorbed prattle was entertaining for the first five minutes. If you want to read a really semiotic novel check out Darkmans by the very wonderful Nicola Barker."
3,Heavy...,"Being an Umberco Eco fan, I was somehow disappointed. The book is quite heavy, even boring at times."
2,A story in three parts; one is actually good,"This novel is broken into three sections. The first, ""The Incident"" is funny, irreverent, fast-moving, and satisfying. Read to the end of this section and then go find another book. The remaining 368 pages barely budge; mostly the author shows us his comic book collection under the guise of a novel.So one section out of three is good, that's 33%, and a two stars out of five would be 40%. That seems fair, if a bit optmistic."
1,A good idea squandered,"The first section of this book is really very good, so it was particularly disappointing that Eco did not follow through with his initial idea. Instead, he uses the main character to rehash some fairly common criticisms of popular culture. For some reason, he gives detailed plot summaries of numerous comics and books for young people, which is tedious. One just cannot understand what it is that so fascinates the narrator about all of these old comics and mystery novels. By the end, Eco has completely forgotten about Paola, and the persona of his narrator. Then the book just ends. Pffft."
2,Meaning no disrespect.,A nice premise that ends up being like watching some guy listening to himself talk and he knows he's clever.
5,Yet again Eco at his best,"Umberto Eco is one of my favorite contemporary authors and his newest novel did not disappoint me. Although it is his first novel dealing with modern times and not as imaginative as The Island of the Day Before or Baudolino, it is still Eco at his best. Great narrative, interesting and clever plot, and lot of information about the past, this time near past, make this novel enjoyable reading. Perhaps even easier reading than some of his previous works, that need a lot of concentration to throughly follow."
2,too many unnecessary information and foreign words...,"I am a huge fan of Eco. I've really enjoyed all of his essays and books till I read The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana, but unfortunately,it didn't impress me as much as the previous ones did. His books are getting harder and harder to read. This one was full of unnecessary information and literary references. It is really easy to get lost between all those Italian origin comic books,magazines and foreign words which put the translator into very tough situation."
5,Sumptuous Fare for Lovers of Old Books,"This is a book for devoted book lovers. Any bibliophile who dreams of inheriting an attic full of antique books should find The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana to be sumptuous fare. After a medical incident (a stroke) that leaves him in a state of partial amnesia, Yambo caresses book after lovely old book in an attempt to trigger lost memories of his early life. Along the way, readers are treated to reviews of rare books we wish we might be lucky enough to stumble upon along with color graphics of their covers. This book evokes the odor of library dust and printer's ink. I luxuriated in every page. The only shortcoming is a pat ending that didn't do the book justice and cut the book off at its ankles. If you are looking for an adventure story (intellectual or otherwise) this book may disappoint. But if you have a passion for the look, feel, and smell of old books, dive right in and enjoy Eco at his introspective best."
2,A Weak Flame,"Fantastic writing, interesting concept (initially), but Eco doesn't deliver. The first half works; the second half is tedious and boring. If Eco wants to catalog every work he has read, perhaps he should sign up with GoodReads. Ugh."
1,The What? of Who? ... and why you should ignore this book.,"IMHO the worst book Mr. Eco has ever written bar none. If you are not a post-graduate student of Fasict Italy do not bother with this book. Even Yambo is the least well defined of Mr. Eco's lead characters. A blank slate who remembers what he has read...no..not quite...he doesn't remember (spoilers follows) all the trivial and/or popular material of his childhood and we are forced into memory lane with this excuse for a romp through Italy of the 30's and 40's. Even when Yambo gets his second ""stroke?,lesion?, brain fart?"" all you can hope is that he dies. He dies but not quickly enough. There is one great story about the Gorge in his coma but not enough reason to buy the book, I only wish the sun had gone black on page 246, not 449."
2,a painfully laborious read,"I was drawn to this book by the illustrations. I had heard of Umberto Eco before, but I had never read anything by him. The first 100 pages were interesting, but after that I just got tired of reading this. I had to finish it because it is so unusual and unique. By the end, I had a deep feeling of relief that it was finally over. I wouldn't recommend."
1,Superauthor defecates on stupid and gullible readers!,"A poor joke on people like me who are stupid enough to continue reading it. There are warnings enough, if we would but heed them. The high point is the scenes from Mickey Mouse and Clarabelle's Treasure. I don't think that I will ever read another Eco book and may burn the one's I have. Just the effect the author hoped for."
2,"Should be titled ""History of Fascist Italy in comics"".","I am a huge fan of Umberto Eco's Novels. I am a huge fan of his Essays. In this novel, he is using a potentially interesting plot to tie together the true intent of his novel, which is to showcase the history of fascist italy through popular culture. Anyone interested in the history will love this book. Sadly, when I buy a novel, I want a real novel.That said, although the first two thirds of the book really drag, once the narrator goes into a coma, things really start to pick up (odd, isn't it?). There is one great highlight--one of the characters makes a great argument about why god is a fascist. The rest of the novel is a painful purgatory of forced history lessons.My advice? Re-read Foucault's Pendulum instead."
2,This is not good music,Why do people buy this crap. Why i bought it I will never know. This is one of the worst bands i have ever heard in my life.
2,Just doesn't do it for me,"I have only listened to this CD once and I just can't get a feeling for the music on it. I don't know why..I do like two of the songs on it, though.I can see myself parting with this CD from my collection."
5,great cd!,"If you want a cd with good, attractive boys, that have good voices, good songs, and harmonize well, you're in the right place. I like the fact that they play their own instruments. The best song on the cd is ""Back Here"" it's a good cd!"
5,"Not just another ""boy band""","I absolutely loved this CD. BBMak are probably going to have to put up with all the boy band comparisons, but most music lovers will realize that BBMak has a lot more to offer. They're not just trying to build off of the trend that BSB started. BBMak writes most of their own songs, as well as play insruments during them. The melodies that these three voices create are amazing, and I highly recommend this album. My favorites are ""Back Here"", ""Unpredictable"", and ""Ghost of You and Me."""
4,A GREAT DEBUT ALBUM,"This album has a really good compilation of songs, that anyone can relate to. From the uptempo like ""BACK HERE"" and I'M NOT IN LOVE to Mid Tempo like GHOST OF YOU AND ME and UNPREDICTABLE. This album truly proves that BBMAK has something in them. This album also proves that they've got talents, because they don't only play their own instruments but they also write most of the song in this album. It also proves that they're not just a bunch of pretty faces without talents.Not like some other groups out there who claimed that they've got talents when all in all they don't have any. If you like music that are more up or mid tempo or love song or even dance song then I would reall, really recommend this album but if you're not into this type of music then I suggest don't buy it, BUT TRY TO LISTEN TO IT ANYWAY maybe you'll find it good. Because I surely did.krissy"
4,Breaking The Mould,"BBMAK cannot be described as a boyboy as they easily standout from all of the rest. For one they actually write their own songs and second they play their own instruments. Sooner or Later contains the two UK top ten hits, Still On Your Side and Back Here and other great tracks like Im Not In Love, I Can Tell and Love Is On The Outside. This is a great album full of great cheerfull songs from a serious group"
5,Amazing!,I have to be frank and upfront. i have only heard about 4 songs on the album from a friend. But they are just so incredible! the lyrics simply penetrate your soul. the music accompanied by it makes you wanna completely blow your speakers. It is something totally different from something the music world has seen. Pretty boys that are actually musically talented and have touched instruments in their musical careers? unheard of! until BBMAK came along. I cannot wait to pick up the album. I am just waiting for the day when every other band tries to imitate BBMAK and jump into the bandwagon of pop w/instruments played by the singers! i dont think they will ever master the art as well as BBMAK.
5,EXCELLENT!! GREAT SONGS FROM BEGINNING TO END!!,"Everyone has had the experience of buying a CD and then skipping around trying to listen to the tracks that are good. With this album you will not have that problem. It is great from their first single ""Back Here"" on track one to the end!! These guys are the real thing and if I was in a boyband I would watch out! I have seen them perform live as well and their vocal range is astounding. I bet they could bag NSYNC like a homemade lunch! This CD is worth every penny and it's a must for every pop music fan. They don't use clever dance moves, and they can even play their own instruments!! I like to see one of these other boy bands do that!!!"
4,Great new band,"Just got this cd today and haven't stopped listening to it. This is a cd you can listen to and enjoy from start to finish. Actually I bought the cd mainly for the ""Back Here"" single, but now I like most of the other songs as well. BB Mak has some great voices, great lyrics, and great background music too. This album can appeal to anyone who likes pop music. To me, their music reminds me somewhat of Savage Garden's music on some tracks. You get a good mix of fast songs and some slower ones too. My favorite song still is Track # 1- Back Here. But I also like Next Time, Unpredictable, Ghost of You and Me, and Love is Leaving. Go get this cd. You won't be disappointed. This group shouldn't even be clumped in with the other ""boy bands"" such as BSB or NSync because they have totally different styles and sounds. They have plenty of talent. Plus they write some of their songs and can play musical instruments."
5,The BEST**,"BBMak is definetely one of the best groups around! They have excellent harmony( I went to see them at a secret gig, they were absolutely fabulous! ), great songs( some which are written by them showing that they have songwriting talent as well) and to top it off, gorgeous faces. All of the songs on this album are wonderful, and it really showcases BBMak's talent. It goes from melodious slow-tempoed songs( ""Ghost of You and Me"", ""I Can Tell"" etc) to fast-tempoed, fun upbeat songs ( ""I'm Not In Love"", ""Next Time"",etc). But what puts BBMak apart from other so-called ""boy bands"" is that what they are singing has a lot more depth and meaning, and can be related to. I think that they have a very promising future..go bbmak!"
4,Great for a debut!,"This is a great album for a debut by BBMak. It features the awesome hit ""Back Here"" and plenty of other future hits. The album is uplifting with some nice BSB style tunes and a bit of 98 degrees and even *Nsync and LFO here and there. Its good but not every track is a scorcher and looking back, once the guys get another album out it is sure to beat this one. Not bad guys!"
5,great combination of instrumental and vocal talents,"BBMak shows a talent that exceeds that of any average boy-band. They exhibit their skills through amazing instrumental and vocal performances. Unlike *NSYNC they wrote the words to more than half of the songs on their album. This CD has a very British sound to it, distinguishing it from many of today's artists. I recommend Sooner or Later to anyone who enjoys a great CD with many catchy songs."
5,THIS CD ROCKS THE PARTY!!,"I MAY NOT BE IN LOVE WITH THEM BUT THEY ARE GREAT!! THEY KNOW WHAT PEOPLE WANT TO HERE!!! IT IS THE PERFECT LOVE SONG FOR ALL PARTYS!! ""BACK HERE"" IS THERE BEST SONG!!! I THINK THEY ARE GOING TO DO GREAT!!!"
1,Another boyband?,"I don't like this. I give them credit for playing their own instruments and writing their own lyrics, but file this one between O-Town and NSync."
5,The Boy Band that isn't,"It isn't that I don't like typical boybands. I'll be the first to admit I've a few backstreet boys and n*Sync cds lying around. But it's nice to see a group who is willing to break the mold and take a risk on being different. Anyone who appreciates well written songs, good harmonies, or awesome guitar playing will love this cd. The best thing about this cd is all the songs on the cd are so good that they easily overshadow the cd's first single ""Back Here."" Unlike many typical cds put out by ""boybands"" each sound has its own distinct flavor and theme. Whether it's a song about the power of love, or the sadness when love's fire has burnt out, BBMak just can't miss. Pick this cd up...I guarantee it's well worth the money...:)"
5,I love this cd!,"I really just thought they were going to be another boy band with talent of singing and dancing, but I was wrong! They all have great singing voices, and they all play instuments. If you like their single ""Back Here"", then you will absolutely love their album. Most of the other CDs I have, I don't even like half the songs, but on this I love every single song! Their songs have great harmonies and the guitar playing is awesome! Also, their songs aren't repetitive at all! Take my advice and purchase this CD, because you will absolutely love it!"
5,Sooner or Later,"BBMak have really sweet, nice, guitar stringed songs. The lyrics are nice, and their voices mix well with their music. Plus, they're really a boy band because they play the guitars. I also suggest you go out there and get this or order it now."
3,Ghost Of You and Me,"Hi, just to let everyone know that the song ""Ghost of you and me"" is sung by Rick Price. Although he is not as good-looking as these lads, he definitely has a great voice. Check this song of his instead..."
4,Beautifully crafted and catchy!,"After I bought this cd, it didn't leave my player for about a month. These guys are so talented, and I am positive that they will make it big, make that HUGE, in their home country. But, fo now we get to hear them endlessly!The lyrics are so sweet, and the guys seem to make sure that the listened follows what's going on that it's a delight to listen to. The ballads are achingly beautiful. The uptempo numbers are fun to sing along to, or play while driving.""Back Here"" may be their new version of ""I Want It That Way"" it's done so well. Cheers!"
4,works but intermittent connection,"Easy to install, but occasionally one of the connectors comes loose and my turn signal starts to make rapid flashing sound to indicate either the bulb is out, or a loose connection. I just have to hit/slap the offending light cover and the connection is re-established... at least, for a few weeks. Seems to be effected by hot/cold temps. Either way,- much easier than hard-wiring a harness."
2,Speak Was Better,"A little more personal is a huge dissapointment coming off of the hit Speak. For one,this album seems to much like she wants to prove herself. There are only 4 good songs on the album,``Confessions Of A Broken Heart``,``Black Hole``,``I want you to want me,``Edge Of Seventeen``. The album ends too shortly. Its a waste of time. Get Speak."
3,Personal...but could be a bit more.,"This is Lindsay Lohan's sophmore album. It's a nice try...but falls short of expectations.Lindsays Freshman album had a lot more pizazz to it than this one does. It's a nice album, but it could have been worked alittle hard er on.The best songs on this album are: A Little More Personal, Fastlane, and Edge Of Seventeen.If you are a Lindsay Lohan lover, then you'll probably love this album. But if your not a regular Lindsay fan...I would listen to the album first before buying it."
5,AWESOME!,I think Lindsay is a great artist. Her new album is great and it definately is a little more personal. I can totally relate to her Confessions Of A Broken Heart. GO BUY IT!
1,Damn B**** hurt my ears!!!,"aaaaahhhhhh!!!! THE PAIN!!!! Can't believe I listened to the samples of this album. Hopefully those 15 minutes of fame are almost done. She's at a crossroads in her career now, which lead to either Pornos or obscurity. So please stop funding her drug habit people! On a side note, giving phony 5 star reviews for talentless garbage has gotten way out of hand. This fraud has gone to heights that not even Enron never dreamed of."
1,her music is horrible,"she's pretty, but not talented at music she should stick to movies instead. And what's with her dating older men, is she trying to build a pedophila fanbase or something?"
5,awesome great and better then the first,lindsay lohan has a second album and it gets a little more personal it has many great songs. a easy listen and you can relate to the songs either by self experience or from knowing someone else who has gone through the thing lindsay has. you can feel the dedication she put into this cd and you know its going to be great. go out and buy it today!
4,Finally someone being honest!,"Two days ago i picked up Lindsay Lohan's 2nd album ""A Little More Personal"" and i was blown away. I really feel that Lindsay is being more honest in her songs, especially with ""Daughter to Father"", and letting the world know what she is going through. I thought the re-makes were great and i'm really glad i picked up the album."
5,WOWOWOWOWOW,I was never a huge fan of Lohan. But NOW I AM A CONVERT! This is one great pop album. Almost every song on the album has great melodies and incredible hooks. How does one songstress get to have so many good songs on one album while others struggle to find one. Bravo for Lohan eityher finding great songs herself or hiring others to do it for her. If it is the latter: keep hiring them. THis album will remind you of how good pop can be. The new Madonna? Hmmm. The new Kelly Clarkson? Definately.
4,Continuing respectability,"This sophmore album from Lindsay does grow on the listener, I must admit it. It's nothing spectacular, but it's very listenable and quite enjoyable. Ignore Lindsay's personal life and, to be honest, the things she tries to say about it on this album. They're not particularly credible or interestig. Focus on the music. It's a bit more of a rocky and edgy sound than the debut ""Speak."" Lindsay's husky voice has its own unique quality to it, can't be said that she sounds just like just a carbon copy of a whole gaggle of other young singers. The songs A Little More Personal and Who Loves You are very good, I hit the repeat button. In summary, quite respectable female pop/rock."
4,Almost Excellent,"Ok, so what if she did movies before music, was red haired before blonde or black. That doesn't matter. Lindsay Lohan makes an album any artists should be proud of. Not only is the writing exceptional, but Lindsay's husky vocals have improved greatly since 2004's faux rock, dance pop silly teen aged album ""Speak"". Her strongest points come in with the rocked out ""If It's Alright"" and ""A Beautiful Life (La Bella Vita)"".Other notable tracks include the beautifully produced painful track ""My Innocence"" and the revealing ""Confessions Of A Broken Heart"". No matter what headlines may appear or what bottle of dye she buys. This album is one of 2005's best."
4,Very Impressive,"Well even though I havent got this CD yet I still have to say that after listening to some samples and watching the video for Confessions of a Broken Heart I have to say Lindsay Lohan has quite a lot of talent. Just like in Hilary Duffs self titled album Hilary Duff Lindsay Lohan has a lot more to do with the CD. Her most depresessing song is the first track which is sang extrmeley well. However, I just have to say that Hilary Duff is a bit better than Lindsay Lohan in terms of her songs."
5,Incredible and talented!! I love it!!!,"She is so talented! She overthrew her last album by 10 miles, I agree with all the other reviewers. Any bashers are just liers that didn't even buy the album, get a life people! Its awesomeAlbum Grade: 98!WAY superior to her other album and a smash cd of 2006!"
4,I really like this CD...,The new Lindsay Lohan CD is pretty cool. I got to hear it before hand on MTV Leak and I immediately went to buy it on Tuesday. The more I listen to it the more I love it! You can hear how personal it is and how much her heart is in each song!!
1,Not 4 me.....,"I luved Lindsay's album ""Speak"" but this album shows her trying 2 be 2 mature....""Speak"" kinda got me back into the pop arena, reminding me of my high school years but ""A Little More Personal (Raw)"" has the theme of I HATE MY FATHER.....EVERYONE HAS TO KNOW.The album has the vibe of ""Hating Daddy"" within which can be quite offensive 2 girls (like me) who have loving fathers.....I know a lot of kids have bastar*s of daddy's but you dont have 2 tell us about it all the time....some things may be better left unsaid.....Also its hard for people like myself 2 sing-a-long coz the lyrics are based on hate toward a family member......I thought Lindsay was gonna be our new age Britney....but nope shes gone off the track a lil......"
5,Confessions Of A Proud Fan,"Lindsay Lohan,is back in the building with what is said too be her most powerful album of all.The Lyrics, the Songs and the overall concept of: A little more personal makes us forget about her Mean Girls Disney Image and makes us see exactly what its like too be Miss Lohan, Confessions of a Broken Heart is the perfect song too open up this perfectly written album, in my personal opionion there is only one flaw about this album, there are only 12 songs but who cares because we all know that lindsay will be working on her next album very soon and are all looking forward too what shes going too whip up. All of Lindsays Fans will love this album and those who think Lindsay is just some little Bullimic Drama Queen, well think again because Lindsay is back and she aint going anywhere"
