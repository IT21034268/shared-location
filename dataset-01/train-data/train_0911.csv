5,DOOM!,"Comparing this release with their last, Velvet Darkness They Fear, it seems that ToT have created their own sound, since, to me, Velvet Darkness sounded like My Dying Bride with an extra female vocalist. I never was too big of a fan of death vox, so this album is definately a breath of fresh air! I'll be looking forward to more ToT albums!"
5,Aegis,"When I first heard 'Black as the Devil Painteth' from Theatre of Tragedy's second album 'Velvet Darkness They Fear' I said to myself, ""This band would be amazing if the guy did more singing/harmonious moaning like he does on this song!"" And when 'Aegis' came out, I played the first song and got goosebumps. And as the album progressed, I decided that TOT made a good choice by having Raymond change vocal styles. I am a huge fan of TOT (and also of Liv Kristine's solo work) and like all that they have done, but this is by far their best album! This CD is excellent from start to finish! Raymond and Liv Kristine are an excellent vocal pair and the energy they create between each other is apparent. With excellent keyboards and guitar riffs that create an almost mystical atmosphere, it will be very difficult for TOT to make an album that will surpass the energy and creativity of 'Aegis'. I also think it's pretty cool that all the song titles are the names of women!"
2,It's terrible!,"When does the satanic garbage of Norway wanna stop? The music is quite-good but the lyrics are awful. The language is english-norwean. I didn't ever like gothic music, so I won't. Please stop making so low albums! I wonder, is Norway the country of the devil?"
3,A LITTLE DISAPPOINTING,"When I first listened to this album, I disappointed because of the weak melodies and the weak voices of the singers. I'm NOT a fan of gothic metal, in spite of that, ""Aegis"" is good, if not a masterpiece. But what shall we do, the fans of ONLY pure heavy/power/thrash metal? There is no doubt about that. UP THE IRONS!"
4,"This album is still good, in spite of missing quality of sound a bit!","I would like to purchase the Japanese Edition, because I have the Brazilian (South-American Edition) and the Brazilian booklet is not beautiful as the Japanese. Detached tracks: ""Angelique"", ""Loreleine"", ""Siren"".Despite the fact that T.O.T is the first band, whose genre is ""The Beauty And Beast"", the sound is not extremely amazing yet. It still misses something is related to this kind of music."
5,Spectacular!,"This televison series is quite popular all over the world. And in my opinon for one good reason, it portrayes evrything teens want, Lorenzo Lamas plays a, fugative cop who was basicaly framed, and is now on the run, he is known as reno rains, but his friend Bobby Sixkiller another bounty hunter, helps him out, the duo is very comical, action packed, and rebellous, ( renegade) is one of the reasons I became a motor cycle lover and so help me god, thought about becoming a bounty hunter. I also, find it is very exciting and on ends, you never know what may happen as the 2 approhend bad guys and collect Big bucks, they are still trying to bring down, Dutch Dixon a guy who hides begind power and, govermental posiston, the series is great and can be seen on USA network... Very good and who knows maybe when im 18 i may geta motor cycle it sure dose look fun, check this video out if at all possable youl love it."
1,Wast of money. It falls apart when dispensing,"I got this at W-S as my co-worker said her batter dispensor from W-S was great. This was the only model that W-S was selling so I purchased it.It is very difficult to close the white lid after filling the chamber with batter. It is also very difficult to clean.The cylinder chammber is 2 pieces and batter will go inbetween the two pieces. You need to carefully squeeze the plastic piece, to loosen and take apart for cleaning.Eventually, the plastic will break or warp so that the other pieces will not fit. Do not purchase this!"
1,Domestic Diva Disappointment,"I was given this as a gift after asking for a different brand batter dispenser.When I got it I thought, Oh nice. It isn't as bulky and it says it is drip resistant, great.To my horror I ended up with batter all over my kitchen. It only held enough batter to make 6 of the larger size pancakes. I was cooking for myself, my 2 & 5 year old, none of us had enough to eat. I tried to make a second batch with a much thicker batter. I couldn't get the Cuisipro open and when I did win the battle with it, what residual batter was left in it added to the mess which was once my kitchen. Even with near mashed potato like batter it leaked, and the pancakes with the thick batter wouldn't cook all the way through. I can think of many ways to improve this device and until they do, do not buy it. Unless you do not like the person you are purchasing it for!"
4,Doesn't hold a lot...but works pretty good.,"I can't say I have any complaints about this device. I bought it to pour batter into a smaller cake pan. When I tried to do it manually, I'd get batter everywhere. This seems to keep the batter pretty confined. I wish it had some different patterns the batter could be disbursed in. Like maybe spaghetti shaped or something. But it comes out the center in this star kinda shaped sausage.I always seem to forget that there's a little drop left after I'm done dispensing. It enevitably drops on my counter or floor. I'll learn."
4,sean o'riada sa gaiety,"Wonderful music with an outstanding performance by Sean O'Riada of 'Carrickfergus"" but poor sound quality because it's a recording of a live concert."
4,Dreaming Didgeridoo,My children love the didgeridoo and this cd is packed with its wonderful sound. Their favorite is the first track. I would highly recommend this cd for anyone. You get a mixture of upbeat and mellow music all with the didgeridoo. Amazing.
3,OK but not great,"When my dad first bought this for my brother and me, we were very excited. We tried it out, and it worked really well, and the ""smoke"" came whisking off our hands. But I noticed a horrible smell on my fingers,went to wash my hands. However, both the smell and the goo couldn't come off. If you're looking for a really cool magic tricks, this is kinda cool, but not the best thing out there."
3,"A Fun, Exciting, Enthralling....Mess","I love this stuff. I bought it because I thought it would be entertaining to show people. I tried it and It worked great. Smoke flew off my hands so quick, but then I tried to wash it off. Here's a notice.... THIS STUFF DOESN'T COME OFF YOUR HANDS! It comes off somewhat, but this sticky film just stays on your hands all day, no matter how much you try to wash it off. Very annoying, but tons of fun."
1,Mystic Smoke No More,"This products stinks in more ways than one. We were excited for my son to use it because he loves magic tricks. All it did was produce a stinky, slimy, smelly mess. We could never produce smoke. Getting it off took a great deal of effort, and soap to remove. It has a strange odor and honestly I am not sure it could ever work if you love magic tricks. It went right in the trash. What a waste of $3.50!"
3,meh,"this isn't really that amazing. but baby oil is the best way to get it off, for those of you who had trouble."
3,Fun to play with until you get sick of the smell,"This is exactly the same as the mystic smoke I bought as a child almost 30 years ago--including the unpleasant smell. It is fun to play with, but in my opinion it isn't practical for an actual magic act (unless you work sticky fingers into the act). The little puff of ""smoke"" is only visible close up, so it's definitely not for stage magic.I have enjoyed playing with this with my children, all of us making little puffs of smoke as fast as we can. The smell gets old quickly, so a single tube of this is probably a lifetime supply. :)"
1,SMOKE?,"You guys got smoke? I got what seemed to be a sort of spiderweb from my fingertips. My 5 year old son rolled his eyes and said ""Dad that's terrible"". He's a smart kid, if he said it's terrible then it probably is."
1,sucks,this sucks.no smoke.leaves a mess.all i have to say is this is probably the worst product on Amazon.com don't buy
2,Yuck!,"It arrived in good condition, and quickly, but smelled AWFUL, and stuck to my fingers until I washed them 7 times. It just looked like fuzzez in the air. I don't recommend this, and think it is a waste of money. Overall, just a waste of 4$.Sincerly,Darrah R. Bortnick"
1,not what i expected,This mystic smoke crap works but leaves a very sticky residue on your hand that stinks n is hard to get off
1,"not smoke, strings!","So disappointed. I can get behind sticky fingers or smelly fingers as long as SMOKE was being produced. It's latex goo, and makes thin strings when you pull your fingers apart... I am a sucker..."
1,Doesn't work,"Don't waste your time and money on this terrible product, if you do get this product don't force it out because you might end up breaking the tube."
2,sticky and gewy,It did the smoke trick but it just looks like little sperms flying in the air. LMAO and once you run out of it on your fingers it leaves this residue that is all sticky and you litterly have to SCRUB your hands to get it off.
2,too messy,"its a bit too chemical for my taste, and it seems to work only the once. and leaves a smell of burning tire on the fingers"
2,Wellllll.......,"i agree with Elijah5585, its all ""yay"" and fun by the look of the product but... i bought it and it smells, its extremely sticky, and by making the ""smoke"" its like feather weight strings of the liquid that floats. i hope its not toxic, i got animals. Maybe i'll put a video of it soon"
3,I love tea !,It is a nice product but once the water boils it shuts down permanently. I have seen others that can turn back on when the temperature drops. On this you have to turn it on manually every time water cools down.
2,Where did Troma go wrong?,After the greatness of the original Toxic Avenger and the laughs-a-plenty of the first sequel this one really doesn't deliver. In this one Toxie needs money to buy his blind girlfriend her eyesight back and so accepts a job from the devil himself. After that it all goes a little bit strange with Toxie playing a video game for his life. There is hardly any violence in this turkey and the only funny moment in it comes from Toxie urinating on Satan's face. It's totally lame and was made by stapling all the cut elements from the previous two flms together. Unless you're a real maniac you'd prefer to watch Barney the dinosaur than this (oh hang on...maybe not). Total tosh. The only reason I didn't give this 1 star is because of the pretty cool gang fight at the beginning but that's all.
1,This was a Disappointment,"As much as I like Troma films, this movie was seriously disappointing. As a fan of the first two films in the Toxic Avenger series I was expecting a lot more from this third installment. Instead, this movie is a large step backwards from the previous two. The acting is horrible, the fight scenes are awful, and the plot is lacking.And it features one of the worst endings ever. The ""videogame"" showdown makes little to no sense. Regardless of whether or not you're a Troma fan I recommend steering clear of this one."
1,Total Trash!,"Hardly even worth the review but here goes: It isnt Funny, not enough violence,stupid plot. DON'T WATCH. Oh yea this film gets the very rare one star vote because troma didnt even try on this movie. I usually give 2 stars to a film that at least makes an effort."
2,I feel let down.,I bought this movie having high expectations after seeing the first one(best movie ever created by man). I popped it in and was pissing my pants in excitement. Little did I know that what stood before me would be the biggest let down in my 16 year life. The one part that made me smile was in the beginning when Toxie ripped that bad guy's intestines out and wrapped them around his neck. I have very high hopes for Toxic Avenger 4 since they really need to make up for this one.
2,Pretty boring!,"The movie started out good. You see Toxic have a pretty good fight scene with some bad guys. Then, it goes off telling us about what happened to get to that point. Well, that was when it got bad. Toxic turned Corporate and turns his back to the people. After that it gets boring because there's really no story to get, he just goes around thinking about what he has done. Then, after he finally realized that he was wrong. He then trys to do right. The only thing is that there's no good fights scenes. All there is boring talking and cheap stunts to see. Then, Toxic just wins and the movie is over. This was pretty disappointing to watch."
3,Not as good as the original.,Not a bad film. The start is very uncessisarrily violent where a young girl is shot and she is twitching on the ground. Yuk.
3,In search for that niche....,"Clung, the main character, is an orphaned white male raised by an adoptive Chinese father. ""Ghost Rider"" is the story of Clung's efforts to find his niche in the white man's world, as well as in the Oriental way of living. Max Brand, the author, not only develops excellent characterization of Clung and his adoptive father, but also of Winifred Sampson, the financier's daughter, whose goal was to help Clung find his niche. The human shortfalls of greed and manipulation are evidenced by the financier, John Sampson, and his enterprising cohort, William Kirk. The paperback is an entertaining read. It may not be one of the best novels you ever read, but definitely is not a waste of your time."
5,Lots of paper,"It's good to get study questions from an authority. Since this review is pre-CISSP test I can't speak to the value of those questions. I'm certain they'll be right on target though.I liked the book very much. I liked that newer information is included like wireless networking HIPAA and other topics.I think the book is about 100 pages too thick. One can literally rip out the first 99 pages and not loose any content. The first 99 pages are all the questions. The rest of the book are the questions repeated again along with the answers. I couldn't help but think someone went out of their way to create a bigger book knowing that all the information could've been covered in fewer pages.Since the original CISSP Study Guide is also formatted this way I guess it's okay, but it still wastes a lot of paper IMHO and more than likely adds to the cost of the book.Call it a pet peave I guess. Other than that, a great book and highly recommended."
2,This Mortal Huh?,"Now, calling this TMC in the wake of the two previous albums (""It'll End In Tears"" and ""Filigree and Shadow"") is a bit of a stretch. Missing here are the massively-important large-scale contributions of the likes of members of Cocteau Twins, Dead Can Dance, Cindytalk, Colourbox, et al from the 4AD stable, and accordingly, the cinematic sweep of atmospherics that characterized those albums never gels here. Much more of a 'song record' than even the first album, the choices of material here don't always seem as focussed as on the prior efforts. I recall being very excited when this came out...and very disappointed when I sat down to check it out. Not the place to start with TMC; get the first two releases and see what all the buzz _really_ is about."
2,doesn't live up to the previous releases,"I felt compelled to write this after seeing another reviewer remark that ""only some underdeveloped tracks annoy; the rest is flawless."" Are we listening to the same album? Of the 5 or so people in my group of friends who are TMC fans, the sentiment about Blood is unanimous: they were trying to do another Filigree & Shadow, and fell way short. I gave it a couple years' worth of sporadic listens before finally selling it to a used store. Can't say I've ever missed it. Especially when I can listen to Filigree & Shadow and hear what this excellent band was really all about."
5,I could easily go verbose in expressing my love for this album. But I shant.,"This album changed how I listened to, and heard music.Back in 1992.It is still a Desert Island Disc. Still some of the finest cover material. Still some of the best use of cello. Still one of my favorite epic aural journeys. And though I know the route by now, the scenery still dazzles."
5,Beautiful and very contemporary,"Possibly the best of This Mortal Coil's albums. At the vanguard of all the 'chill-out' music of today, it has aged rather better than its predecessors, more firmly rooted in their time; one doesn't need to be a nostalgic Goth to succumb to these beautiful and haunting melodies."
5,Mystical journey to help escape reality,"I've been a fan of 4-AD & in particular This Mortal Coil since the middle 80's when their music was available as import only material. There is a general haunting though soothing feel to most 4-AD artists & This Moratl Coil ( the studio group) has always been one of my absolute favorites. If you are looking for a mystical experience, the music of This Mortal Coil is a must to listen to !"
2,sounds approaching coherence,"The stars maybe in your eyes, but not in mine. ""Blood"" is like trying to listen for a glimmer of recognition from the ""B"" songs on a favorite album. As a whole, it bears strong affinities with the single ""No.9"" track on the so-called Beatle's ""White Album."" If you truly enjoyed that endeavor by John Lenon And Yoko Ono, I would guess you'd like buying ""Blood"" too. (If you have never heard ""No.9"" check that out first!)""Blood"" is neither as satisfying as the famous surnamed phrase ""This Mortal Coil"" (Shakespeare?) would suggest, nor as celestial as so many five-star reviews could guarantee. Drats!"
2,Depressing,"I love ambient music, but this is too depressing and dark, and unless you're in a huge downer kinda of mood, this will not be of enjoyment to you. The song Nature's Way is simply awful and akin to funeral music. The picture of the cover sums it all up, horribly dark and depressing. I am a fan of spooky sounds and haunting ambient, but not a fan of lyrics that have everything to do with death...it's simply too morbid and depressing for repeated listenings. This one will be going to the ebay pile!"
5,excellent book on the Bible version debate,This book is an excellent reply to KJV-only types. The authors explain the origin of the Bible in a way that is accurate and understandable.
3,"My Review of ""From the Mind of God to the Mind of Man""","A good basic review of the Critical Text position as held by Bob Jones University. Somewhat simplistic, with some misleading and/or false statements. However, it is not as abrasive or misleading as most KJVO books, and it does a decent job of being fair to the other side."
1,Don't waste your money,"There is nothing in this book that's unique except it's pitifulness. He wrote with the assumption that his readers needed psychological counseling in the area of life. The book reads poorly and it's quite obvious Victor did not take the time to hire an editor as the typo's, mis-spellings, verbage used, and grammar errors were so blatant it was pitiful. In one chapter, it's so bad that several paragraphs (approx a page worth) was repeated, exactly word for word (and it doesn't happen once). I read it fully just for the dis-belief that someone would waste their money putting this to print in the condition it's in. Further, the exercises he demonstrates in the back of the book are nothing new but only a way for Victor to get some face time in front of the camera. In a nutshell, it's a book written by someone who claims to be a professional trying to pad his wallet. What a shame and a waste."
1,Not as advertised,"Delivery of Product: A+++ Product: D- The tree arrived within three days of being shipped. The tree was very well packaged. Description of product was completly wrong. Description said ""Red Maple, 12 to 16 inches tall, blue ceramic pot, Larger trunk base"". What I received: Green Maple, 18 inches tall (top of the pot to top of tree), tan pot. ""Larger Trunk Base"" is a general statement and is in the eye of the beholder. Numerous leaves were spotty. In the end I am going to buy a different Red Maple tree."
1,Not as pictured,"I am very disappointed in this item. The tree upon arrival was unhealthy with spotty leaves. The pot is not as pictured. Although I have followed instructions exactly as given, the tree died in a matter of weeks. Very sad. :("
1,DO NOT BUY,"Bought tree in November 2007. Came in without leaves, looked dormanr because of winter. It is spring now (April 16, 2008), tree was not dormant, IT WAS DEAD. Amazon refuses to do anything about this tree. They have collected my $28.99 and sold me a dead tree. Rating should be a negative 5 stars."
4,Nice healthy tree.,Not really what I had in mind when I orderd the tree. Needs a little more work then I thought it would.
1,Brussel's Japanese Red Maple Bonsai,This item arrived looking half dead with no leaves or blooms. I followed the instructions but the bonsai never had a chance. This was a total waste of money and unfortunately I bought two different bonsai's as gifts and they both did not live. I would NEVER recommend purchasing this product. If I could have rated this less than one star I would have done so!
3,RED MAPLE BONSAI,"Slightly disappointed. Plant overly pruned, leaving few choices in further shaping. However, plant did arrive in very good condition; securely packed and soil nicely moist. Sent in a white rectangular pot, not the blue pot shown. A fair price for what was recieved."
3,Nice little tree,Arrived safe and sound with good packaging...STYROFOAM peanuts..not cornstarch as stated..real pain. I question this being 5 years old or I would think they would have started some sort of wire forming of the trunk. other than that it was just OK..
1,It died within 24 hours,"It came on Thursday and I gave it as gift. The next morning, it was dead. Every leaf was curled up. We don't know what happened."
5,Lovely and healthy!,"I'm so happy with my red maple bonsai! A healthy and beautiful 5 year tree arrived - I can't believe the deal! Other buyers need to be aware the red maples do change color to greenish red with the season, so they may arrive not completely red. This tree was well packaged, looking very healthy and beautiful. I've never seen a more mature maple that can be purchased at anything close to this price. Overall I'm very happy and glad that I took the chance, in spite of a few less than favorable reviews."
5,Spiritual fiction at it's finest,"I got this book from the library in the science fiction section, but I would classify it as fantasy instead. I couldn't put it down, I enjoyed the characters, the story, and the spirituality. Great stuff!This book may challenge your world view, so readers that cannot approach a differing world view with an open mind would be advised to avoid it.The 'new age' sprituality is introduced at a light pace, and fits seemlessly with the story. As a contrast, The Celestine Prophesy series tended to bog down for me in this respect.To readers that enjoyed this book, I would also recommend 'Religion Wars' by Scott Adams.Entertainment: 5 starsEnlightenment: 5 starsOverall: 5 stars"
2,This is not what you think...,"I began reading this book thinking it would be an intelligent (as opposed to Lahaye's Left Behind) interpretation of Revelations. Nope, not even close. While the writing may be good, if you are a Christian, don't even bother. The central Character is all about New Age and Eastern Religions. At first I was thinking, OK, this must be the AntiChrist - pretty good portrayal. Then, two thirds of the way through, I finally gave up. The guy that wrote this obviously has never studied the Bible.Sigh. Oh, well, perhaps one day there will be an accurate fictional account of what is in store for Earth in the end times."
3,Ordinary quality at low price,"As stated above, the list price can not be more that 40 to 50$. The colors are darker. The quality is okay for the price. It is made for Walmart. The quality is also set as per that :)Buy if you want the best in cheapest."
1,NotWorth it!!,"I got fooled by the bright colored picture on the website only to realize later that it costs lot cheaper. The fabric is rough and the colors are dull. Rightly, the price had to be dropped by $10 aftermy purchase. You would be disappointed. Donot buy it. It is not worth it."
4,Very nice for the money!,"This is not a premium quality set, but it's better than most I can find for up to twice the price. Very nice looking, and reversible. Stiff right out of the package, but a trip through the washer and dryer fixes that."
3,"Cheap, dull, and harsh, but worth the money","The fabric comes stiff and scratchy with ""starch"" and must be washed before using. The comforter is really a ""full/queen"" size, NOT a regular queen size, and the fill is light (OK for here in the South but probably need a heavier one up North). The bed ruffle is really a 13 inch drop according to the package, not a 15 inch drop.The colors are much duller than the picture shown on this site. Specifically where you see a light tan color, it's really a darkish gray-brown putty color. The actual label on the set itself has the same color problem.That said, the sheets are OK after washing--not fancy, but not hopeless. It's not easy to find even an OK queen sheet set for the price of this complete comforter and sheet set, so you basically get the comforter, shams, and ruffle for free. I can live with it."
2,YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR,"The bedskirt was literally coming apart at the seams, and to say that the material to which it was attached was like paper would be an insult to paper everywhere (actually, I think paper would be more durable than this skirt). The material is the cheapest, flimsiest quality I think I've ever encountered. I realize that the thread count is only 180, but you can exfoliate while you sleep, the texture is that scratchy.Had I paid more, I would have returned it, but the comforter and shams(while exceedingly thin) were in a pattern I wanted so I kept it. I pinned the bedskirt to the box springs because it kept pulling apart at the seams."
3,Different color than advertised but still a decent set,"I paid $24.99 for this set, which is just about what it is worth. The item that is pictured is not the same as the item that you receive. The colors are much darker than the picture, and it is a different color scheme altogether. Fortunately, I still find the colors to be satisfactory.Overall I'm not disappointed with the set and if they had more color varieties, I might pick up another one."
4,A common bargain priced bed-in-the-bag,"We received this set about a week ago and it is your common run of the mill bargain priced bed-in-a-bag-- the kind you see advertised at Wal-Mart and others for ""$40 ANY SIZE Bed-in-a-bag"". You get what you pay for, but for the price (and free shipping!) who could go wrong on a back-up set or guest set for this price. Sheets alone cost almost this much, so I would recommend it for the price it's at. Order a set of new pillows while you are at it and you'll be all set for guests!"
3,OF COURSE IT'S WORTH IT!!,"Thanks for the great buy folks! I realize Wal-Mart sells this also, but they want TWICE the money. I really think I got a bargin for my $19.99. The price you claim this to be valued at is an EXTREME stretch....but the product is still WELL WORTH the money I paid. Thanks again for the bargin."
1,Doesn't worth your money!,"After reading good reviews, I ordered one. and I was expecting a nice set. I am completely disappointed, it is an extremely low quality product and doesn't worth any money! the fabric used is harsh, the fill is not enough, almost no fill! I was expecting a fluffy comforter with a smooth fabric but it is a complete disappointment. I don't know how other people gave 5 stars but I have to give only 1, to balance others' exaggerated rates."
2,Bedding,This product did not hold up well at all. I would not recommend it. Both of the sheets simply fell apart afer about 6 washings.
2,Boring,"I expected to find wisdom I could apply to my own life and my own decade-long struggle with bulimia. Although I didn't find the author as self-obssessed as many eating-disorder memoir authors, the book was just plain DULL. A better writer might have made this story interesting, but as it stands, it's just a dull rehash of a story we've read a million times in TEEN magazine."
3,Same old analysis on the eating disorders,"As someone who suffered from eating disorders during her teens, I often read books and memoirs on Anorexia and Bulimia. I like to read about other people's experiences with the disorders and how their stories differ from, or resemble, mine. However, Inner Hunger offered nothing new to the complex world of eating disorders.Apostolides researched the illness and illustrated the behavioral patterns of Anorexia by making thorough research and writing about her own experience. Fine. But everything that was said in this book was nothing new to me, I'm afraid. I know most of the things discussed in this book from having read other books or memoirs. However, if you are new to the subjects of Anorexia and Bulimia and you are looking for precise information on said disorders, then this is the book to look for. All and all, it can't be denied that her research was well done."
5,good,"For many people inner hunger seems repetitive and somewhat boring. At times, i myself felt that as well. However,i loved the book so much because i could relate to it. i feel everything that she felt and went through. Everything that i can't say the right way, everything that i can't tell my parents is right there. i even have gone through the same eating patterns, from starving myself for weeks, to eating all the food i could find, to then throwing it up. this may not be the most exciting book, but it definately made me feel as though i'm not alone."
5,Mozart At Its Best,"I have been a fan of oboist Sandra Gerster Lisicky for over 23 years. I have radio recordings taped from her Soni Fidelis days but this is the first ever CD recording that she has performed on that I have found. While she is not the principal here, she does stand out, as all of the members do.Chamber music for the wind instruments gets lost in the glamour of string and keyboard pieces. It's a shame, because they are a delight to listen to."
4,For Those Who Like This Sort of Thing...,"For those who like this sort of thing, it's just the sort of thing they would like. I just happen to be one of those people! Thirkell is reactionary, pro-aristocracy, and writes about the tragedy of the gently fading county gentry in Britain, and how awful it is that they can't maintain their great houses and get servants anymore. I'm not with her politically, but she tells charming tales, mostly about young people falling in love and everybody surviving the War and post-War years. I read ""High Rising"" first, which is cackle aloud hilarious, assuming the rest would be. They're not, but they're very pleasant."
4,Brings you back to another era,"This movie certainly is a ""talky"" with lots of crisp dialogue rapidly spoken between a fine cast of mostly unknowns. It's a modern era noir that is definitely a throw-back to a time when film actors talked fast, got to the point, and then twisted those plot points in a surprising fashion that makes you think, ""I didn't see that coming"". Considering the budget restraints, you would never guess how this film was completed so professionaly. If you want to experience a modern film noir and get a taste of a lost generation of filmmaking, then The Appointment is worth checking out!"
2,noiresque bogus,"If it weren't too late , I'd get my money back. Don't waste yours on this modern-day overpriced noir fake. There is a little interesting dialogue, spoken without poise, and shot without visual depth. Listed on amazon.com among classic noir films, I took the bait and now cannot spit out the hook. Need I tell you that I'm disappointed and irritated?"
5,Excelent practical guide to every junior or intermediate modeler,I loved that book since it is full of practical advices and really justifies its goal of being Modeler's workbench. I use this book often in my daily data modeling practice.
5,Describes the process of Data Modelling,The book takes you through the process of producing a Data Model - from the point at which you are asked to create a model through to completion. It offers a wealth of practical advice and tools to enable you to create a model that will be fit for purpose.I use this book in my professional work as a consultant Data Architect and I recommend it to all of my colleagues.
1,A real farse.,"I read the other reviews and thought wow, a good source of knowledge. Instead I got a book full of ridiculous ""so called tools"" to help in defining the data model. Meta Data Bingo? If I sent mail out as suggested in the book to play this sort of game I think I would lose all credibility with my peers. This book just does not add any value unless you are a complete idiot. Actually the only value add is $54 to the author. A real waste!"
5,Awesome,These guys have an amazing voice. It is so incredible. They have like a pop/R&B sound to their music and it is a beautiful harmony. I recommend this single and their CD to anyone out there that loves romantic music.
3,Memories.,"My mother used to play the vinyl LP version of this disc when she did things around the house when I was about five years old. Somehow, those old LPs are either gone, or rendered useless by the cold uncaring scrape of a diamond stylus and its partner-in-crime; time. Finding this collection was like buying back a piece of my childhood. While the songs are clearly dated, the harmonizing song styling remains interesting, and viable. The compilation also contains the best version I've ever heard recorded of the semi-standard ""Una Mentira Piadosa"". If you know who these artists are, this is a must have recording for your collection."
3,best cd.the ever haer,ilove this music sens a was a litte personi ben lookin for this music for ever.plese if you ave this cd.plese send the cd.
2,disappointed,"As a first time customer to Amazon, I was disappointed to order the item, need to return it, yet again received an item where the team name appeared streaked."
4,A Lesson in Sharing,"The gentle, generous dragon Trafalgar True gives the gift of a Sun Stone to the cute little kith and kin. Instead of enjoying the lovely stone together, the two groups begin to argue over who it belongs to. When Trafalgar tries to restore peace, the two groups must come together to save his life.It's a sweet (maybe overly sweet) tale with a clear lesson that kids from toddlers to early grade school will enjoy."
5,great coffee great price,"I have not been able to find this coffee in any local store,, and was very happy to find it here on Amazon. The coffee has a bold flavor with just a hint of the vanilla."
5,awesome!,This coffee is one my absolute favorites but it is really hard to find. There was previously one local store that carried it but it's not there anymore.
3,The first recipe was bad.,"The first recipe I tried was Slow-roasted Tomato Fondue. I should have known better when it called for a total of one hour cooking time of chopped tomatoes in olive oil at 400 degrees. They were burned to a blackened crisp. I will adjust the recipe and try again. There are lots of other recipes that sound very good in the book, but just beware of the instructions."
2,Poor packing,"The bulbs arrived on time in an oversized box with no added padding. The ""contractors pack"" box was unsecured in the larger unpacked box with one of the six bulbs banging around the bottom of the box. The filament of this loose build was broken. One wrap of bubble wrap would have probably prevented this."
2,Good Lighting but Very Hot,"These were shipped quickly and are good lights, however, they make the bathroom very hot very fast!!!! Having to go back and order the frosted ones to see if that helps with the heat it projects."
3,dissapointment,"im a huge skinlab fan that is not to excited about this release. there are a few good finds but most of this album is slight remixes of songs you can find on other albums. this would be a terrible first skinlab purchase. as far as categorizing this band i dont believe they fall into ""nu-metal"". whoever started that term needs to re think it. skinlab is one of the few bands that are keeping straight up metal alive. it would be wrong to lump this band into the overatted pop metal bands like korn (if you can consider them metal). if your looking for a good metal band skinlab is it just hold out on this album for a while."
3,Just like Mike!,"This was a cool video to see. A candid chat with Mike P and a cool little jam session with Mike and Bozio. It was cool to watch, but for the price (I paid around $25), I can't suggest it. Just something nice to have in the collection of Portnoy stuff :)"
4,Very well done!,"I have taken classes from Pamela Lynn and am very excited about her new CD. I found the instructional part with the reference guide excellent. The play along part of the CD really encourages you to listen to the rhythm and challenges you to keep the pace. Thanks Pamela, Very well done!"
4,"Not as essential as ""Plante Bandera"" (its predecessor) but a nice addition to your Salsa CD collection.","At long last available on CD, this album was Olivencia's follow-up to his wildly successful ""Plante Bandera"" release from 1975. On this album, Olivencia introduces the superb but underrated sonero Simon Perez (who excels on such standouts as ""Buena Suerte"", ""42nd Street Mambo"" and the hilarious ""Evelio Part 2{el muerto}"")--sadly, he was the only solo singer to have sung with Olivencia's band that did not record even one solo album. On the other hand, Lalo Rodriguez sounds cool, confident and relaxede on the boleros ""Hoy No Me Recuerdas and ""No Has De Verme Liorar"" and the descarga all-out jam ""Vengo Del Monte""."
1,Horrible!,"This was a waste of money! It is horrible! It is nothing like the picture or the ones in the hospital. Instead, it is made of a cheap plastic and bends and curls. Do not waste your money, too."
2,"It Could Be Worth Your Money, But It's Not.","This game has the potential to be good but it falls short in so many ways. I wish I would have read more reviews before I purchased it. Even reading the box cover had me convinced I was getting a great game but I was fooled because I had way too many problems while playing.1. It takes too long to load up.2. The more stuff you add to your hotel the slower the game plays.3. Then it freezes up the computer for no reason.4. You have to save every five minutes so you don't lose your progress.5. Sometimes the game just reboots on its own.6. Too much time is spent bulding the hotel, than is spent trying to manage it.7. This is what I hated most. You have to pass all of the game tutorials before you get access to all objects needed to be the best Hotel Manager.My advise is this, if you want this game then buy it used. Don't waste your money."
4,GOOD SIM GAME IF YOU LIKE DESIGNING & MANAGING,"In this game you design the interior of your hotel and run it. My sister had origionally purchased this game, but was diasappointed when she saw that you couldn't design the outside of your hotel, so I played it, and liked it. This game is not GREAT, though, like Blitzkrieg (awesome game). It is kind of akward, because the items you can place in your hotel are all different sizes, and the things you really need to put in your rooms, like baggage tables etc., are very small. This makes your hotel look weird, almost too big. The items also don't match sometimes, but you get over it. This game can be very time consuming but enjoyable. The graphics, in my opinion, are better than the Sims, and the objects are very realistic. I would only buy this game if you want to spend a lot of time designing your hotel, and not that much running it. Overall, 4 stars. Or, out of ten, 7.4Hope this review helped!"
3,Or you could watch grass grow...,"I thought the idea of the game sounded fun, but it turns out it's not that interesting, long term, to sit around and watch hotel guests! I like the idea of building and running something, but I found ""Tropico"" (where you set up a tropical island and run it) much more fun because there is so much to do! (Setting up agriculture, industries, housing, entertainment, bribing enemies, firing workers, bulldozing tenements....) I even enjoyed Zoo Tycoon much more, since building a zoo and watching the animals is more fun than watching hotels guests. This game just doesn't live up to its potential!"
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,"This is one of the worst games ever created. I feel ashamed and hurt to have bought this. I spent 40 bucks on a piece of turd. I tried sooo hard to give it away. Noone wanted it. Face the facts. It flat out sucks. There are too little options. The rooms feel akward and dont make sense. The graphics are horrendus and there are very few objects. It almost makes me cry that I spent time playing it. The controls are flat out awful, it took me nearly an hour just to figure out how to place an object. DO NOT BUY!!! DO NOT ACCEPT AS GIFT! DO NOT PLAY! DO NOT LOOK AT!!!!! Trust me... you dont want to play."
2,Could be great game,"I got this game at best buy (and paid more than here)and loaded the game when I got home.I thought ""Wow this game is cool!"" but then all of a sudden instead of thinking ""cool game"" I was screaming.The game quits unexpectedly and you loose all of your work.If your thinking the manufacturer could help you , your wrong.If you go to JoWoods site the message boards are filled with tons of people saying the same thing and JoWood does nothing about it.You can email them and they still will not do anything.You could buy the game.The 5 minutes of game time is pretty cool, but expect problems."
2,Not very good...,"This isn't a good game. When I opened the box and saw a CD and a slip of paper that was the manual, I had a feeling I was in for some disappointment. However, I still held out hope that maybe the game itself was great. It wasn't. The game throws you into the mix without any intruction or tutorial and you are left wondering what to do. I took a look at the box again just to make sure it wasn't a puzzle game. The game basically wants the player to figure everything out with trial and error. Give this a pass."
5,I never knew it was so fun to own a hotel!,"Hotel Giant is the best tycoon game I have ever played!You can build your own rooms,build lobbys,make spas,pools,bars,computer rooms,even librarys!This game rocks!"
2,Ick!! Horrid game playing,"I bought this game and another,..., at the same time and found that while [the other game] had cute little graphics and a laid back theme, Hotel Giant had crude graphics and a hard interface. Once you finally figured out how to place everything you're tired of the game had no further desire to play. It's one of those games you wish you didn't invest [$$]in! I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless they really really wanted to spend some money. Pass this one by, folks."
2,doesn't even work,"I tried this game several times, without success. I know for a fact that there are a lot of versions of this game that DO NOT WORK! They won't even start and tech support won't help. Take your chances...it was a nice thought though."
5,Great!,This game is great-I dont feel like writing a whole review for it (l-a-z-y) but i will just tell you its fun. im only 14 and its great i think all kids around my age would enjoy it and adults too...i'd give you some details but like i said iml-a-z-y.
2,Review Time,"This card runs at blazing speeds but Ultra2 Wide is soooooooo uncommon. Firewire is a very fast transfer protocal. It is less common than USB but a tiny bit slower than USB 2.0. You should go for a regular Firewire card, but if you do use Ultra2 Wide you should pick this card. The last point I want to add is that this card is very, very expensive. Overall, you should try a different card with just Firewire."
3,Good Read,"As a fan of Elaine Barbieri, I found this to be a good read but the romance in this historical romance was thin. I don't care for books with so much emphasis on a historical point that the romance is secondary. While David and Meg's story is nice, their romance is not in the forefront. He remains devoted to her over many years but we see very little of the fruit of that devotion because more emphasis is kept on her relationship with her brother Sean who is so focused on revenge he nearly destroys them both. I would have liked more emphasis on the relationship between David and Meg. I thought Sheila's love for Sean got better treatment. It's a good read but it's not Barbieri's best. I prefered Eagle."
3,Enthused entrance,3 1/2Free-jazz with heavy improvisational depth certifies the majority of chemistry on this live debut doesn't end up as indulgent screeching.
4,Nice & Easy,"I like this fryer. The whole not having to touch the oil thing is the greatest invention sense the deep fryer ;-) The fryer works well, dosent stink or smoke too bad at all, and is easy to clean. My only peeve and reason it got 4 stars is the catch or hook for the basket is small and hard to hang the basket on. When your tring to hook th basket to drain the food that little hanger is kinda a pain. All in all, I'm very happy with it and would recommend it to anyone wanting an easy to use and clean fryer."
3,Returned it - Too small,"I should have seen this at a B&M; b4 ordering it. It's SO small. Uses 1 L of oil, but it isn't a rotofryer like my Delonghi, so it's capacity is tiny. I think you might be able to fry 1 or maybe 2 pieces of chicken, but that's it. In my Delonghi rotofryer I can fry 4 pices at a time.I returned it w/o using it, so can't comment on how it functions."
4,VERY VERY EASY TO CLEAN LIKE NEW,"I ONLY HAVE THIS ITEM A SHORT TIME. SO I DON'T KNOW IF IT WILL DEVELOP A LEAK AS I SAW IN ANOTHER REVIEW. BUT, MY UNIT WORKS VERY NICELY SO FAR. THE WHOLE GREAT THING ABOUT THIS FRYER IS HOW EASY IT IS TO CLEAN WITHOUT TOUCHING THE OIL IN ANY WAY. THE WHOLE THING COMES APART IN TEN SECONDS, GOES INTO THE DISHWASHER AND COMES OUT LIKE NEW.IT AUTOMATICALLY FILTERS AND DRAINS THE OIL. YOU END UP WITH A TUPPERWARE TYPE CONTAINER WITH PRETTY CLEAN OIL TO USE AGAIN AND AGAIN. THE UNIT HOWEVER IS PRETTY SMALL. FOR EXAMPLE IT MAKES ABOUT TWO NICE PORTIONS OF FRENCH FRIES AT A TIME."
2,Disappointed,"I had only used my fryer a handful of times before I noticed a significant decrease in heat. It was nowhere near the temperature indicated on the dial and I would have to increase the heat frequently just to keep cooking at a lower than desired heat. By the end of the second or third batch I have the dial maxed and it's barely adequate to get the job done. The troubleshooting guide in the manual made no mention of this particular issue. I've gone back to frying in a pan and shopping around for another deep fryer.The only reason I'm not rating this a 1 is because of the convenient features; filtering system /oil container, dishwasher safe parts. Great additions however the entire unit seems rather flimsy, especially the removable handle. The bowl is also quite small. I could fit close to double the amount per batch in my old fryer.Overall I'm pretty disappointed."
3,Good but not Great,"I think that this book has some good workouts, but I think that the diet part of it is not good. I lost 10 pounds, but not by doing what this book says, This book just made me feel motivated to get into shape. I now have a set workout that I do everyday, some of the exercises are from this book. To lose a lot of weight, just cut candy from your diet. It helps A LOT. I do think that this book is worth getting though."
2,my review,"Good for introducing teenage girls to weight lifting, but that's about it.I've recently come across other weight lifting books that have better info. The New Rules of Lifting for Women and The Female Body Breakthrough. There's more detail with the workouts that isn't in Toning For Teens. More variations to exercises and more workouts, and detail as to when to up the ante and weight. With TfT, you can break up the upper/lower body workouts to spread out over the week but that's about it. You're left on your own.It's a good start with getting teenage girls to get past weight lifting myths. I thought at first that it was kept simple for that reason...except another of Joyce Vedral's exercise books (Bone-Building/ Body-Shaping workout) seems to do the same thing. So close and yet so far. So if you're serious about getting into weight-lifting, read more books, educate yourself."
2,Chrome Finish - lackuster Performance,"Don't be tempted by the $40 price. This is an OK toaster at best. Using one side works as an average single toaster, but using two sides just doubles the toasting time. The heating elements in mine are no longer lighting up fully after only one year. No crumb tray - just take it outside and shake it upside down. It's sad that this had to be built and packed in China, shipped all the way here, then become pretty much useless after one year. My previous toaster - now being used again - has lasted for over 40 years..."
2,Not enough here,"There's, literally, 1 incredible track on here: Palm Skin Productions's ""The Beast (Autechre Mix)"". The rest of the record just sort of meanders apologetically under the nom de plume of ""Ambient music"". Just because the music is supposed to be smooth doesn't mean it should bore, and this record sort of comes off like the smooth jazz of the genre.Except for that one track. That one track almost makes the whole trip worthwhile. If you can find it used for under 10 bucks, get it. If you can find the track on any other album, get it."
1,Does not perform as advertised,"This $320 to $360 product does not perform as advertised. For E.g., it can not find a main street that even a cheap GPS finds! It is hard to work with as well. Hope somebody likes it, but not me.--FredB"
1,This does not work,I had one for two weeks.1st It kept saying my home address was at the nearest corner.2nd It would say you arrived at your destination way to early or way to late. Took you to the neareast street corner.3rd Every time I tried to get help it was always closed.I would not recommend this product to anybody.
2,Bad Customer Support,"My Drive 140 came without the 2 Gb SD chip in the box. Customer support would not send me one. I had to supply my own SD chip and am now in the process of downloading maps from Pharos website - three per day limit! The GPS is underpowered so the display lags behind real-time - if you are using it to navigate to a location you can easily miss a turn. All in all, I'm very disappointed with the product, but even more with the customer support."
2,Okay for entry level but the graphics are weak,"For an AMD system this one is pretty high end - except for the graphics. Based on the Nvidia Nforce chipset, this system is aimed at entry level users. An otherwise nice machine is hobbled by week graphics. If you even intend to play games, stay away from this machine. Not only is it based on a graphics chipset that is about to be discontinued (can only be found on very low end graphics cards today), but it uses system memory, which is slower than graphics cards with their own integrated memory. So it is slower than your standard GeForce 2! If you are an entry level buyer there are cheaper systems, if you are a power user this isn't for you. Therefore it is hard to reccomend this system to anyone."
2,Difficuilt to read,The textbook is extremely difficuilt to read. The exceptions from the articles which are supposed to help in the understanding of the case complicate issue even more. You have to supplement reading of this book with hornbook or Emanuel/Gilbert. If you can avoid this book feel yourself lucky
2,Activities that doen't make sense to my kids...,This is a group of activities that are boring for my 6 and 4 year olds. I tried the other Cars PC Game and it doesn't run and I can't get any support to figure out the problem. Did I really waste nearly $50 in Cars packaging?
2,Poor choice!,"My 3 year old grandson is a huge ""Cars"" fan. He is very bright and works well on the computer, but this game is not what we thought. It is difficult to use, confusing even to me as an adult! I would avoid paying money for this one!"
4,Still providing hours of fun,"Unlike many ""once and done"" games ... this game continues to provides hours of enjoyment for our family."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"TO EVERYONE.I'm not asking you,I'm telling you this game is a save your money.Big headaches and masive frustraitons with the ramone dance game,Mater train and Sheriff persuit.So don't buy it if you enjoy severe headaches."
3,Fun and pain,"At the outset, I do agree that this game crashes right upon startup, however, it does so only when you have unsupported video cards - and the Read Me suggests that it won't work with onboard/integrated cards. Don't know the veracity of the last claim.I experienced this pain when I used it on a hand me down system - P4 2.8 w/some integrated video chip. Then I acquired a decent system that supports ATI X1650 PRO PCI-E, and lo and behold the game worked fine, except...There is an instance when it fails repeatedly (almost always - there are rare occasions when the system plays), and here is when it happens on my system: Arcade -> Piston Cup -> Palm Mile Speedway. There may or may not be more code paths which cause the system to report ""Stop Error."" My opinion is based on a day's worth of usage."
1,Do not buy it,"It appeared to be a surprise that Disney can't produce a reliable product.I have installed the game on my new PC running Windows XP Pro, however, the game crashes on start up. Surpisingly, the manufacturer provides no support and their web site even has broken links."
2,Not what I thought I was getting,"I was thinking this was the same as the game cube, playstation cars game. Its ok, but its too hard and too easy at the same time. Not a lot of help unless you sit and read it to your kids, and then the games are a bit boring and not exciting."
1,"Requires latest video hardware, No Thrills","The list of video cards in the readme file that DO NOT work is extensive. Perhaps they should have listed the ones they successfully tested the program with. The readme file instructs you to update to the latest driver if you have problems, well that's pretty insightful. In my case, and I would suspect in most cases, Windows XP SP2 has the latest driver. The readme file says downloading and installing a new driver will solve most problems. There is no other action recommended or contact information provided. i.e. if it doesn't work on your machine, sorry, it works great on the development platform.3/31/07 - Runs on nVidia 6200 256 Mb. I figured since it required latest graphic technology it would be very cool. Now I wonder why it would not run using on-board graphics, there's nothing that looks too intensive here."
4,"Well done, for 4 and 5 year olds","I'm reviewing this for Mac OSX. The game works great and is a lot of fun for my soon to be 4 year old. He can handle some games and some are too hard, but that will let him grow into the game as he gets older. Surprisingly, none of the games are major stinkers. There are lots of bad computer games out there, and very few games developed for OSX, so I was very happy to find this quality game. My only complaint is that the stuff that is locked (until certain challenges are met) is a little confusing and frustrating for my son."
3,Acceptable,"After multiple trips to Hawai'i I find this album represents the native music about 80%. There are better, but this is acceptable.I don't care for the 101 Strings arrangment on one song. The humor of ""Room Service"" dates about the time of the ""mommie / Daddie"" letters from summer camp. I have never heard true Opera on Maui."
1,not what I expected,the rubber is very hard and not comfortable to sit on.....the nozzle where you blow air is very rigid and if you move around on the cushion you feel it....I have another vinyl cushion which I like very much.
1,didn't even last through two days of use,"This cushion was quite dissapointing, initially comfortable, it began to completely lose air after two days of use, four hours each time, because of a defective valve design. The one I got appeared much more sturdy than it actually was, decided to try it based on all the good reviews but it only held air for 8 hours before completely deflating thru the valve, tiny person sitting in tiny chair, so it seems more an issue of design than weight or stress on the cushion. Your experience may vary but i'll be looking for a different type of cushion. money wasted."
3,Not exactly what I was looking for,Very good quality. Very well made and durable. I was looking for something not quite as hard. Even when not fully inflated it causes too much pressure
3,it is just ok,"I am having difficulty keeping it inflated, although I am on the high end of its preferred weight limits. It is also a bitduncomfortable since the surface is ""pebbled'. I would rate this item as adequate, at best."
3,Purchased for pressure sores.,"Easy to inflate. I've tried using it but it is not large enough to fill my recliner. I have pressure sores on my bottom and it hits them all in the wrong way. Inexpensive, so not a problem."
2,kerrappily made,When I opened this the valve looked like it had been gnawed on by an old rat and then someone held it in place with scotch tape.
5,really a great product,I purchased this product for my mom as her old one finally wore out i was able to purchase it from amazon much cheaper then i could have locally and my mom loves it. very easy to inflate and it eases her discomfort a lot so money very well spent.
1,Impossible to blow up.,can't be used. i have tried everywhere to find something to connect to the valve to blow this up. what a waste of money.
3,Fair,"I just started to use this product and so far it seems to be fairly good, except for the fact that it is a little rough and heavy, which turns into a little annoying to use with a transfer board because they stick together, making it difficult to take the board out. Other than that, it seems to last forever."
4,Cushion for the handicapped,So far this inflatable cushion has served its pupose for my wife. She is handicapped and has to sit all day and needs something that is comfortable for sitting. Other inflatables that we purchased developed leaks right away and were not satisfactory. So far no leaks with the Amazon cushion.
4,"Carex Inflatable Ring Cushion, Rubber-from Amazon",This item makes a wheelchair more comfortable. I find I like it betterif it is not fully inflated to make it softer. If your in a wheelchairthe majority of the time I recommend the Carex Inflatable Ring Cushion Rubber.I found the best price at Amazon.com.
5,This cushion saved my butt!!!,"I was suffering from an anal fissure and having a heck of a time sitting down. I tried pillows, cushions, etc... but nothing worked. I did a search on Amazon.com and found this inflatable cushion. I ordered it and have been sitting in comfort ever since. The cushion gives great support and comfort while seated. The rubber is heavy duty and durable... I recommend that you do not fill the cushion up full with air, as it will be too firm. I weighed 240 lbs. and filling it half way with air was perfect. Due to my anal fissure pain, I changed my diet radically and am now down to 203 lbs. I still use the cushion as it is a great seat cushion at work. If you have back or butt pain, I highly recommend this inflatable cushion!"
2,Stinky ring cushion,"I bought them so that I can use it for my long international travel in planes - the seats i am sure all of you know does not have much cushion. It works ok but the smell of rubber is so strong that i had to make s cloth cover still did not help, so i used to carry it inside a plastic bag and take it off when using. The other day i found a clear $5 same plastic cushion, no smell, cheaper, looks better from HEB pharmacy area. Now I am a happy camper and have carex ring cushion for anyone who needs them."
2,smells...,"strong rubber odor. I would have loved this product if it wasn't for its smell. I really tried. I even washed it with soap and everything.. but the smell won't go away. I can't stand surrounded by stench of car tire smell. Does it really make that much difference in manufacturing cost to have it made with just a slightly above the quality than the ones they used? If it wasn't for the smell, I'd be buying them in bulk and place it everywhere I sit and also pass it along to friends as a gift!"
3,Too heavy.,"Not a cushion that you want to take with you on a long trip.Cons: -- too heavy-- really hard to inflate-- material can be softer, it is made out of heavy duty rubber."
3,Good when it's working,Hardly used it. Bought it only for few months but it stops working now. Getting deflated in 5 minutes after full inflation.
2,missing screw on valve,"This would have been a good product, except it didn't come with a valve to hold the air in. Am hoping Carex will send me a replacement, or even just a valve would be nice, whatever is supposed to hold the air in, hehe, otherwise it looks like a sturdy product *shrugs*"
5,Great product,"Bought this for a friend that had surgery on their back end, they said this was a life saver. It is made of high quality rubber and easy to inflate."
2,Not for me,"I found this cushion to be too small, and too firm. I did not find it comfortable to sit on and returned it back to Amazon as it was of no use to me. Those that prefer a lot of support might like this cushion."
4,strong and durable,The inflatable Ring Cushion is made of strong material and feels very durable. It is slightly smaller in diameter than the one we purchased previously.
2,Very dissapointing,"It does not keep air well, and it is not as simple as blowing up an inner tube, and I don't know how having a bicycle pump or something like that would make it better. I have to re-inflate about twice a day, and I am not a large person."
5,very good!,"I broke my tailbone after giving birth, then find that cushion very helpful! you can blow inside to make it more or less soft as your condition require... I'm at my second pregnancy and my tailbone broke again, then after trying the foam cushion ( useless, totally waste of money) then I bought that cushion again...( be careful that your cat don't play with it then you can use it for more than 6 months, not like me!) the best I found for tailbone broken... see, I bought 2 new one!"
2,Not right for me,"This is potentially a good solution for some, not me. After a couple of hours of use it became uncomfortable. There is a thick inner ring that becomes uncomfortable. It may be right for a smaller, lighter person. I am over 200 lbs."
2,Valve issue,"This product is flawed in the fact that there is an inability to retain air in the cushion during inflation. Somewhere along the line, somebody forgot to include a valve that restricts outward flow during inflation!"
5,Awesome!! Better than I could have imagined!,"I expected maybe a little relief being that I sit working in a computer chair for most of the day, but to my surprise it allows me to stay sitting without stretching for almost 3 hours! I have sciatica and it's a constant severe pain, and this has cured about 25% of the pain daily. Another 25% pain reduction goes to my inversion table, but that's another review :) BUY THIS CUSHION!"
1,I felt worse after using it,"The inflexibility of an air pillow vs a foam pillow actually created severe neck pain for me at my work station. This pillow is essentially unusable for me: not only was it a waste of money but it created an additional problem. When I began to tell my chiropractor, he guessed the outcome."
1,"Too small, and very uncomfortable to sit on!","I bought this thing thinking it would be comfortable to sit on as I sit 8 hours a day at work and would help prevent hemorrhoid issues and just be overall better for my back and ""rear-end!"" However, it's a small inner tube type design and the rubber is very hard and uncomfortable. It gives very little when you sit on it and because it's so small I wasn't even able to sit all the way back in my chair. Definitely not good and it cannot be returned. I would recommend not wasting your money on this. There have to be more comfortable options out there!"
5,Great value!,"I have tried several other cushions but this one is by far superior. Very thick and durable rubber with a wonderful open/close valve on it, making it very easy to open, fill and close. No trying to pull out a tiny tab of plastic for a pull out, that my hands don't have the strength for. Also, very comfortable and a pretty little pattern of leaves on the rubber cushion - just a very nice detail they added. Love it! Got one for a friend who has been searching too and one for my car."
5,"Very useful, chair type matters","The rubber is thick and durable. It does the job of taking pressure off sensitive areas. After adding this to the chair at my computer desk, I noticed immediately that it was an improvement. If you have any pain or discomfort when sitting, anything that helps is welcome.One thing I noticed is the type of chair matters. When I used the cushion on a different chair, I had a much harder time getting comfortable, even though I previously had no problem with that chair without the cushion. I think the type of back support makes a difference when adding this cushion. I eventually was satisfied by adding a back pillow. Even with this addition, I still find the first chair/cushion combination to be more comfortable."
2,Defective,"This ring appears to be durable and the shipping was fast. However, it has a very leaky valve which makes it worthless to me."
3,Ow!,Sturdy rubber ... thick ... certainly will not pop. But uncomfortable no matter how much air you do or don't put in. Probably good for a long haul trucker. Ha!
5,Great for 3 year olds!,"This is my daughter's all time favorite video. It presents a realistic view of what happens in the hospital without frightening impressionable three year olds. The main song, ""You Have to be Patient to be a Patient"" is a good one to have in your parental bag of tricks."
3,BARONS WAR,"BARONS WAR TO ME WAS DISAPPOINTING BECAUSE HE BROKE UP THE FLOW OF THE STORY. WITH SO MANY CHARACTERS TO PORTRAY, GETS TOO CONFUSING.I STOPPED IN MIDDLE OF BOOK, WENT TO ANOTHER WESTERN AUTHOR. THIS WILL BE MY LAST BOOK BY THIS AUTHOR OF THE BARONS.I MAY TRY ANOTHER, IF THE REVIEWS BY READERS ARE FAVORABLE BY MORE THEN ONE REVIEWER."
3,Too Short,"I have been practing Pilates, Yoga, and both on the Balance Ball for years. I wanted an exercise DVD that would challenge me and keep me interested. This DVD claims that it is not for the beginner, but it spends the first 15 minutes teaching you proper alignment and breath control. Now, I fast forward it through the first 15 minutes and then do the workout. It is still too short and there are not enough repetitions of each exercise. I guess you could pause it and keep going on your own? Anyhow, it is still the best DVD I have found for the intermediate to advanced student."
3,not too challenging,"i thought this video would be more challenging, at least be a tough workout but it really wasn't. i felt it was an okay workout but i wouldn't have rated it a level four. the instructors were fine but not what i was looking for."
3,Pretty good,"The reviews of this video were a bit overstated. This is a good workout and well instructed, but by no means was it as challenging as I had hoped."
4,Cleaned up the...,"rear plate view of my motorcycle and lights it up just fine! I'm a little skeptical of the supplied screws strength, but so far so good (with a dose of loctite thrown in). It looks (nice chrome) and feels solid (heavy) enough to do it's job with no problems. Just remember it is a ""custom"" installation part and be precise when putting it in place. Now...let's ride!"
4,Misleading about the author,"I am a great fan of Alan Titchmarsh. When I looked for garden books by him this book came up. I read the reviews and it sounded good. So I ordered it. It is very good but it is not by Alan Titchmarsh! He simply wrote a very short foreward to the book. I don't think books not actually written by the person should be listed as they are the author! This is nothing against Ms Pereire. Her book is good. It is misleading! Mr. Titchmarsh had nothing to do with this book!! Naughty, naughty!"
4,The Ward Lock Encyclopedia of Practical Gardening,"The rating when I ordered this book as a gift for my best friend was ""New"". I still have the receipt that proves that. Since it was paperback it was still very, very large and heavy and since it said new I thought what could go wrong. Well the book came with a stone in it. Yes a small stone. I thought what is this for. Then I saw. The front cover was damaged not horribly but the right lower corner was turned up and had been several times and the spine was broken, not horribly but you could tell that this book was used. I was disappointed over that. The good part was that since this book is so hard to find, I found a great copy for next to nothing. Otherwise I would have had to pay $70.00 for what they said was ""new"". Don't think I'd order again from this person. I mean, come on, don't say it's new if it isn't."
4,Not bad!,"M is an awesome song, although I have heard better. I really like the way it starts out slow, and then later in the song gets more of a hard beat to it, then goes slow again at the end. And of course, there's more amazing writing from Ayu! This one's worth your money."
5,Great Scottish Overview,"Great chronological overview of the supergroup, Nazareth. Of special interest is the song "" The King Is Dead "". Lovely orchestral background music, and thought- provocating words. Sounds like a narrative review by the Roman soldier, who pierced the side of Jesus, the Christ. There was more to Nazareth than just "" Love Hurts "", and this import cd ia a nice investment. These lads could have been an awesome religious rock band."
4,It's great to see the Foundations hanging by a thread!!!,"Having read both the Robot novels and all of the Foundation series, I can truthfully say that the intesity and excitement was definitely placed heavily into this book. The active 2nd Foundation stirs up lots of mystery in this dark futuristic series. It answers and asks a lot of questions. Asimov has an impeccable choice of words and phrases that leave you begging for more. He truly is the madman and master of all science fiction. He places this genre of literature at a level unreachable by any other than perhaps Shakespeare himself. He has done to the written work what George Lucas has done to the film industry. Only Prelude and Forward are better devised writings. I look forward to seeing what the ""killer bee's"" do with the next trilogy!!!!!!"
5,Foundation Trilogy Review,I highly recommend this trilogy as some of Asimov's best writing. The book also offers an Asimov history of the books and stories that he wrote and world events that were going on at the same time. Very interesting.
5,I love this book!,This was one of my favorite books by Asimov. I lost my first copy years ago. I wanted to read it again so I bought it again. Glad I found it here.
5,Nice gift,This book was perfect for my 26 year old son who loves science fiction. He said he really enjoyed reading this.
3,Good but not Great,"Second Foundation is the best of the original trilogy, but is not up to Asimov's best. He captures the sweep of his 'history' well in this book but manages to say in 100 words what he could have said in 60 if I, Robot is an example. This remains a must read for any real SF fan."
3,Last in the trilogy,"I enjoyed the Foundation series very much, and I would recomend it to anyone. If you have read the first two then there is no reason to not read the Second Foundation, I just found it anti-climatic. I generally enjoy more of a firm ending, and I know that Asimov goes on to write more in the series, but I wanted an end with more of an explination about Seldon and his work."
5,Brilliant conclusion to the original trilogy,"In this book, the third of the original ""Foundation"" novels, Asimov continues to shine. This book is even stronger than its two predecessors, which are masterpieces in themselves. Asimov has again created memorable characters, a whirlwind plot and relentless action. In this novel, however, even Asimov reaches new heights regarding the series of plot twists leading up the book's conclusion, which will leave you breathless. This book is simply incredible in every way and is essential reading for all sci-fi fans. Highly recommended."
3,Can the Second Foundation save galactic civilization?,"The Foundation, which was created to protect and preserve civilization following the collapse of the Galactic Empire,has been conquered by a mutant known simply as the ""Mule"". The only hope for the continued success of the Plan lies with the so called ""Second"" Foundation, founded at the same time as the first, at the ""opposite end of the Galaxy"". With the first Foundation defeated, the Second Foundation must step in to defeat the Mule, and return the Galaxy to its path towards the establishment of the Second Empire. This final volume of the original Foundation trilogy explores the relationship between the two Foundations and their roles in minimizing the chaos in the absence of the Empire."
3,"Good suspence, but over the top","plot within plot within plot within plot pretty much summarizes the twist and turns of the story,but the way and frequency of these turns is rather excessive to a point of annoyance, it's almost like an obligatory end-of-story-twist in M. Night Shyamalan's movies these days. i wont spoil the end like the other reviewer did, but after finishing the supposedly last story, i cant but feel a sense of futility when the final twist is presented. i have to agree it made really good detective/noir story with 'where is it' replacing 'who done it' and a pretty good thrill ride, but at the end nothing get resolved and every thing back to the way they were more or less, one could've saved a great deal of time by just reading the first two chapters and the last if one doesnt care for the suspense, because what ever you read between doesnt matter at the end, and hence the sense of futility and my main gripe about this book, but otherwise it's decent read."
5,Fair price for a used book in perfect conditions...,Bought it used and got quite surprised of how conserved it was..The book it's self is just amazing!! The best fiction I have ever read.
3,not quite as expected,"This book did not look like leather to me. It was a disappointment, and looked like paper processed to look like leather. At least to me.I kept it, because I wanted a copy of the trilogy, and the book part was acceptable"
2,...story,"i can't beleive for the reviews i read here - some guy say ""i didn't like the story"" and give the book 5 stars - why ? because it's asimov !.but beleive me, asimov wasn't a very bright writer. he had some cute books, and some interesting ideas (robots for instance), but was more like a juvenile SF book writer.this book is one of is last, and hance is pretty bad.this book suppose to tell you what and where was the second foundation all about(reffer to previews books in series), but of course it doesn't !.i didn't even understand what was the diffrence between the ""mule"" and the second foundation, since they used same technics and had similar goals.anyway, the second foundation doesn;t sound very good to me - a group of elite people, that has mental control over other people, and has the right to control history - too much risky !, sound like marks and eggels - this ideas maybee apeel to the teenagers, but loose their charm, when it comes for more muture readers."
3,"Hard to understand its ""classic"" status","So that's Foundation done with. In its favour its a short trilogy, and easy to read but it suffered from being a collection of short stories, especially early on.Characterisation is practically non existent, characters are largely forgettable, and the Big Reveal in the second book is so obvious it turns a dramatic moment into a farce.Written in the 40s and 50s, the final story delivers some ""reds under the bed"" paranoia that was prevalent in American SF at the time. It is very much of its time and it really has not dated very well. The central idea in interesting and there is a certain charm to it which keep it in the 3 star category."
4,The Search for the Second Foundation,"The Hugo Award winning wrap-up of the Foundation trilogy. The Foundation is back in operation now that the Mule is gone, but the 2nd Foundation still lurks in the background. A small group of people are hot on the trail of the Second Foundation to root it out and expose it.But where is the Second Foundation? That's the basic theme of the book. But a war could get in the way and end the freedom of the Foundation.Asimov does his usual workman-like job of story telling. The plot moves along -- most of the time -- with a few slow areas.I went for days without picking it up, so I kinda lost track of the many characters, which made restarting somewhat confusing. Part of the problem was that the characters weren't well-developed except for Arcadia, the brash young teenage girl.If you like vintage Asimov, you'll like this."
5,Fantastic,I read the reviews on how this series was a seminal work in science fiction but I did not fully understand those simple words and I will go further and say that not only is this a Sci-Fi masterpiece but I believe it transcends its genre and gives a treatise on the socioeconomic development of nations and just should be labeled a literary Masterpiece that goes well beyond the 50s future tech that almost seems irrelevant compared to the other plot developments that Dr. Asimov conceived. This book should be required reading for all human beings (maybe even read it to your dog) and you would forever be missing something in your soul if you pass on the opportunity of reading this book.
1,Why Price a Digital Copy at the Same Price as the Paperback?,"There is simply something very wrong about pricing a digital copy of a book that has been in print for decades at the same price as a paperback book. The digital book doesn't have to be printed, transported, or warehoused."
5,A good place to start with Issac Asimov,"This contains the three books I would recommend to any person new to Issac Asimov. There are many more to read, but I like this series best. This is a great book for people of all ages!"
3,Total sell out,"Pulled a Metallica here and went pop metal. I grew up listening to Death Angel and was glad to hear they had formed again as The Organization. Bought the first one and it had a hint of the old sound. This CD however was a big disappointment. I am not sure what they were thinking since they are now so obscure that only fans who have kept up and followed them will seek out The Organization. A lot of their early music was hardcore thrash and some heavy metal and I enjoyed them in both sub-genres. This had a reggae feel to one song, a few pop numbers, and an 80's hair band style acoustical. If you are looking for obscure bands then check this out since the lead vocal is unique but if you are an old metal head I would only suggest this if you have everything else they have done and need to complete a collection."
1,Digital Albatross,"Horrible interface, startling paucity of content... and here's the kicker. Encyclopaedia Britannica creates (and I kid you not here) 1.97 MILLION files for your anti-virus software to try to deal with every time you do a system scan. To put this in perspective, after un-installing Britannica my machine dropped from 2,016,819 files to 41,209... and mind you, my computer is loaded - I've got about 50 GB of (non-Britannica) data on my drives! In real time, we are talking about a difference of SEVERAL HOURS for Norton to complete a full system scan.On top of this, I hate to say it, but Encarta has better and more thorough content (and as a Ph.D. student in cultural history, I can assure you that I am used to evaluating content under awkward circumstances). I would also hasten to add that I am not a fan of Bill Gates, so it is with a certain amount of pain that I have to admit that his product is FAR superior in this case."
3,... In the beginning,"It is important to note that Mofolo's intention was to write a tale rather than a biography, and he's produced a great story. This is a fictionalized account of the life of the great African warrior, Chaka Zulu. Translator Daniel Kunene (the novel was originally written in Sesotho) provides an extensive introduction to the text and explains its importance as one of the first attempts on the African novel. Most importantly, he reveals that Mofolo's manuscripts were repeatedly scrutinized by missionaries that directed his efforts, a fact that explains a number of falsifications in the text regarding the life of the Zulu chief. Nothing to get over-excited about, but nonetheless a mandatory read."
1,Dangerous and flakey under Windows 2000,"This product is dangerous and flakey under several instances of Windows 2000 and on different machines. The card is virtually unsupported, current drivers for Windows 2000 Professional are unavailable, there's not even an old version available for download."
2,Not so great,I bought this for my grandson because it is a cute wa to introduce him to books. But........the plush material on the dragon comes off very easily. I was afraid he was going to swallow the stuff & it made a mighty mess! We will stick to the cloth books for now. Gave it two stars because it is cute & he loved playing with it.
3,rodale's book of composting,"This particular edition is old,so even though there is a lot of information, the pictures are old and the diagrams very few. I bought it because it was a hard cover but would have preferred a newer paperback version with more updated information."
1,Not as advertised,This company claimed their product was 100% rubber. WRONG. I received two black silicone strips. Did I mention I hate silicone? Didn't bother to send them back. I'm using them anyway...don't have another choice right now. Did I mention I hate them?
2,Average,"I found this book to be very average. It glosses over subjects poorly, giving me the impression that the author doesn't have a great understanding of the topics discussed. If there wasn't other great books available, or superb video sites like winstructor.com I would then recommend this. But seeing as books like Mastering Windows Server 2003 and Introducing Windows Server 2003 exist and of course winstructor, then I cannot comprehend why someone would feel they got their money's worth with a purchase of this title."
3,Very bad in discussing theories.,Anyone who understands chapter 8 should receive an award from the authors. I believe the authors don't really understand about Active Directory else they could express AD much better.
3,A good hitch cover,I like this cover. It looks nice and does the job. The picture really doesn't show what the back of the cover is like or how it attaches to the hitch. It does fit inside the hitch and requires a pin to hold it in place. The description should really say that what you can see in the picture is metal and the actual receiver insert part is plastic. What I do find is that the cover sticks out of the hitch further than other covers I've used so the rubber bumper it comes with really doesn't hold it firmly to the receiver. I don't really think the receiver is being protected all the much by using this cover but it does look nice.
4,Love thy jeep!,We own a 2006 Commander. It had evrything extra on it except for a hitch cover. This one goes perfect with the chrome and black!
3,Congenital heart surgery,This is a well done book. Useful to get basic knowledge from young surgeons. I liked it and it satisfate my expectaions.
4,Come on! It is only $8 !,"Sure, it is a series of TV episodes linked together to form a full length DVD, but Come on! It is only $8! There is a lot of information, pretty scenery, and stops at various wine regions. I know the sound quality is kinda poor, but Come on! It is only $8! COME ON!"
1,"Good, if you miss drinking Italian wine out of fiasco","I am in the wine business and was looking for something that might show me the varied topography of Italy (and perhaps as a bonus, some specific vineyards of Barolo) to solidify my learning. This DVD does show a teensy amount of topography. Unfortunately, it is painfully narrated by a newscaster-type with disco hair that cannot properly pronounce the grape varietals and DOCGs. More importantly, the information is so outdated, that another sommelier and I turned it off after an agonizing 40 minutes. It must have been originally shot in the 80's as an Italian Chamber of Commerce video with a title like, ""Come Explore Italy, Land of Wine!"" replete with cheesy music and happy villagers. Not much pertinent wine information to be had."
2,Half bottle decantor,"Buyer beware! This is being advertised here as easily holding a 750 ml bottle of wine. Yes, it will hold one 750 ml bottle but it is actually intended to be used as a 375 ml, 1/2 bottle personal decantor not a 750 ml bottle decantor (according to Reidel - discovered after receiving the product)."
3,Fair,"It was useful but suddenly the pages started to fall. Excellent book to read, but I think it needs a hard cover version."
4,Great Information For Criminal and Civil Case Forensics,"There are many books on computer forensics investigations and incident response, but you won't find too many that tell you what you need to know to take the results of those forensic investigations and make it stand up in court. A Guide to Forensic Testimony (The Art and Practice of Presenting Testimony as an Expert Technical Witness) is an excellent book on this subject. Fred Chris Smith and Rebecca Gurley Bace share their knowledge and experience of the legal system and what it takes to make your computer forensic evidence stand up in court and what you need to do to sell yourself as an expert witness and stand up to cross-examination. The book covers a lot of legal technicalities as well as ethical and professional issues.(...)"
3,Slow Starter,I was given this book as a door prize. As a result I found it a slow starter and was unable to complete the book. However the book is well written and easy to understand. It was also entertaining to read some of the examples of court proceedings. I am sure that if this had been a book I was interested in enough to buy or seek out I would have found it both enjoyable & helpful.
1,Not great!,This book might be ok for beginners but not for those of us who could furnish a library with our collection of cross stitch designs. I bought it becouse it said creative ideas for giving. There truly was nothing new about the ideas. She does give good instructions for beginners at the start of the book. The instructions cover any type of counted work (needlepoint) and many of the projects do also. The designs were simple and charted in color. I was not impressed with the designs. I do not recommend this book.
5,"Finally, a 'forest garden blueprint' for us all.","If you are looking for a book that will inspire you to make a forest / woodland garden then this book has everything and more.When the realisation of low-maintenance gardening can produce such an incredible variety of produce, in such a sustainable way, it defies belief that this way of gardening is not implemented all over the world.Absolute value for money, and, as the principals of forest garden can be easily applied to the smallest garden space, there is no excuse for anybody not to give it a go.This book will give you all the help and guidance you need to make this vision a reality and the plants will just keep on giving. Truly inspirational."
2,Misleading and Not a blueprint,"I thought this would be more informative than any website on the subject. However, it wasn't. It lacked all the specifics I would have wanted."
1,Watch out!!!,"Be advised that not all scsi products work with this adapter, I have a Minolta Slide Scanner, and although the product recognizes the scanner there is no way I can complete a scan. Check their compatibility list before you buy. Also the technical support is awful and useless."
5,user error,"The previous reviewer likely has little understanding of how a computer dissipates heat. A huge heatsink does no good if there's not enough fresh air flowing through the system to carry the heat out of the box.That said, this heatsink is HUGE and is capable of cooling massively hot processors while keeping fan noise to a minimum. Just make sure it'll fit on your motherboard and in your system."
5,An important book.,"This is a very important book.I consider it essential because of the rise in power of neo-nazi far-right political parties in europe.Knowledge is power,not fear and hatred.The far-left doesn't escape criticism either."
5,"Great Oil, Price is a joke","I use about 20 gallons of this stuff in my boat. It's great oil, I've been using it for years and get an oil analysis done every oil change. My wear metals are extremely low. The price however... I get it for 12.99 a gallon at my local auto parts store."
4,Hot! Not Quite as Good as the First...,"I liked this story but not as much as Oath of Seduction. As with the first installment of the series, this story is hot. It has graphic love scenes. The story and the alien world created by the author are compelling enough to keep my interest between the sex scenes. I highly recommend this book if you are looking for something really sexy."
3,Creative story; very light erotica,"This book is the first that I have ever read from this author and I purchased it because the plot piqued my interest. Since Ellora's Cave publishes erotic romance, I expected this author's story to fit that criteria. Thus, when the main love interests, Kate and Tair, did not even have sex until the end of the book's last few pages, I felt that the book fell short in the erotica category.In my opinion, this book could have been published as a paranormal romance by fleshing out the plot and adding more characters for future spin off books.For those who love long sexual foreplay with the main characters minus sexual intercourse, this story will be right up their alley."
4,Great Series sad there are only two books,I read this story years ago and keep coming back hoping there will be more books in the series. This story takes place in the future and women basically sign up for a draft to be mated the idea is that they signed up thinking they would never get selected by these alien men. This story is the second of the two stories. I don't think there will be any others but they are both great reads lots of fun.
1,Poorly Constructed,"this item was very poorly made. the first time it was used the cork broke off as well as the chain. the cork was hot glued to the metal base and if you have ever used hot glue then you know it does stick to metal very well.If its JUST for show then I'd buy it but, it is NOT for everyday use."
4,Very ambient and dark...,"This is a good album... Like a more ambient Throbbing Gristle. If you like Genesis P-Orridge than you will totally be a fan of Spatial Memory. He and Splinter Test perform together in this cery trippy musical piece. You don't hear a lot from Genesis' voice this is more like moody instrumental/noise tracks. If you are looking for more solidity and structure than I suggest ""When I Was Young"" By Genesis P-Orridge and Astrid Monroe That is an unbelievable piece of work. But Spatial Memory is definetly worth the listen."
5,This book helped me feel normal,"After leaving my 18 year old daughter at a college 9 hours away from home this fall, I didn't anticipate how hard it would be. I was excited for her to have this experience in a great college town. I was unprepared for how I would feel like I had lost a body part, how I had to keep reminding myself that she didn't die, she's just away at college. This book verbalized many of my exact feelings about this experience. It was very helpful to me and made me feel better. The daughter in the book reminded me of my own vegetarian, jewelry wearing, intelligent, independent daughter. I recommend this book to other parents going through this life passage."
3,Book has a strong religious perspective,"If you are not a Christian, just be aware that the book is very oriented to a Christian foundation. I am not making a judgment about that, simply highlighting the fact. Each chapter starts with a prayer to Jesus Christ. In none of the reviews I read was this mentioned. As someone of another faith, I was very taken aback when I received the book. It did not feel appropriate to my values and faith perspective and wish that this information had been clearly indicated before I purchased the book."
1,Very so-so writing...,"As a writer myself, I found this book to be offensive in the way that it begins each chapter with a religious passage of the Christian faith. How sad that it leaves many other faiths out of the loop.Another VERY big offensive passage was the insert (in the last chapter) from a book written by a dear friend of mine. Ms. Jones states that this writer is ""dying of AIDS"" and insinuates that he is dead. Fortunately, he is alive and well and was never dying from AIDS. There is a difference from AIDS and HIV+.Please do the research before quoting inappropriately and specifically, incorrectly!I would not recommend this book."
5,fielding Saves the World,"The Militia Group debut of LBC, alt-rock outfit fielding comprises a selection of tracks from two self-released projects ""Fielding"" and ""The Bear and the Bird Ep"". This new self-titled album is solidly good end to end. In a market where it can seem that computers contribute as much to pop as people do, fielding proves that music is still an art.With songs that alternately capture your thoughts, break your heart, and make you feel like driving down the freeway with your window wide open and your hand surfing wind currents, fielding will remind you why you listen to music in the first place."
5,Love this CD!,"Got this CD about a year ago and I have to say I love it! If you like bands like Death Cab for Cutie, Decemberists or Jimmy Eat World, don't pass these guys (and girl) up! With mesmerizing harmonies sung over catchy guitar hooks, this album is a solid tribute to the new school indie-rock scene."
2,One good song,"If you were hook on these guys like I was by listening to ""Lampshade"" on Pandora, do yourself a favor and just pay the 99cents or whatever and down load that song on Itunes. The whole album was a bit uninspiring for my taste. If you find it in a bargain bin for $1, go for it."
2,Not an experience I'd like to repeat.,"The first half of the book was purely inane drivel which really drove me nuts (I planned to give this only one star for that)! Cathy sure sounded like a meddling, bossy 'mothering' spinster (not my idea of a heroine). The only highlight of this book was solving those cryptic letters Old Hitch left regarding his will (& his funny/ornery remarks about everyone). The latter half of the book was more interesting, but I had to skim a lot just to finish the whole story."
4,"Small But Easy to Clean, Works Ok","I liked this at first, but now I'm changing this to THREE stars.This is a small fryer. I love how the oil easily drains out and is filtered, and you can throw the rest right into the dishwasher. It only uses 4 1/2 cups of oil, and this lasts for several fryings - which saves money, plus the oil doesn't degrade quickly due to the filtering and straining.The main drawbacks I could see is that you'd want to keep this far from young kids (could easily be pulled off the counter by a young child), and if you are frying for large groups of people, this is a small fryer (basket is fairly small).Worst problem with this is that it barely fried two pieces of chicken. You have to cram them in and turn them around, and I find that the temperature doesn't get hot enough. Either the thermostat is off or it just doesn't heat well....I have since purchased a larger Delonghi fryer."
1,Flimsy construction,"My husband bought me this deep fryer. I washed it by hand and tried to reassemble it, only to have the lid hooks (this holds the lid on the top) break immediately. I didn't use a lot of force when assembling, so this was sent back as a defective product.The replacement fryer was also poorly made. The fryer basket couldn't be raised or lowered smoothly; it could barely move at all unless you really applied force. The plastic surrounding the basket handle holes on the lid prevented movement.Additionally, the fryer body wobbled on the base. Not exactly safe when you're dealing with hot oil!After the second shoddy product, we gave up on this model. Too bad, because I really liked the ""never touch the oil"" idea."
1,Not good for ANYTHING!,"I fry quite a bit and I have yet to find anything except fries that this fryer is good for and even then, not very good! My husband bought the fryer here about a month ago and I have tried to fry fish, chicken, chicken patties, chopped steaks, fries, and veggies. None of it did very well and it took forever! You can't put very much in at once, so cooking more than a few pieces for a meal is simply not feasible. Cooking times are considerably more than they claim them to be as well. So by the time I finish 4 pieces of chicken for dinner, the first two I fixed were rather cold. I will be throwing this thing away the first chance I have and buying another Fry Daddy like I should have in the first place!"
2,very disappointed,I was very disappointed in this fryer. It seemed unstable when you placed the fryer unit on the base. I tried using it twice and both times it leaked oil. The idea of draining and straining the oil seems like a great one but in reality because it comes apart like it does for cleaning it felt unstable. Opening and closing the lid was tricky since it didn't seat securely on the base. I suggest you pass on this product.
4,Deep frying w/o the smell,I have used this about 5 times and have not have a problem at all. the smell is contained thanks to the filter. I'm very pleased.
4,easy to clean,"This deep fryer is very easy to clean, everything goes in the dishwasher except the base. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the basket does not hold much food. Otherwise I am very impressed!"
4,neat deep fryer,"we replaced another deep fryer because it was not convenient and the print had worn off. I like this one better because of the neat oil pan that allows you to drain the oil and then reuse it!!! Awesome, and also I love the fact that it's immersible and I can put it in the dishwasher!! Clean up is so much nicer!!!! And it fries really nicely, so far we've only done chicken wings, catfish nuggets, and fries. It's really lightweight, almost seems flimsy, but so far it's working great for us!! I would recommend this to anyone. I am going to purchase one additional oil pan, so I can have one for fish and one for chicken."
1,Didn't last a Year!!!!,Worked great till it bit the dust. Flimsy untill you put grease in it. It was just the right size for my son's cheese sticks and okra I cooked for him. I liked the 'idea' of being able to throw it into the dishwasher but waited too long between fryings as I used it several times a week and grease would build up and lo and behold it wouldn't come off until I scrubbed it myself. The basket scrapped the teflon sides and the handle would come apart at the most inopertune times and that was dangerous. I didn't trust it as light as it was. I made the children get out of the kitchen area while I cooked as I was afraid they would bump it and it would spill.
2,"Oily, messy, but good cooker when cleaned up","Like everything about this fryer, except, it is a bear to keep clean and oil somehow gets underneath unit, on table and all. Otherwise, a real cooker, but would look elsewhere next time..."
5,A great novel.,This is one of the best books I have ever read. It tells not just a story in a particular time but for me spoke strongly about the human experience with great depth.
3,Maybe not the best place to start if you've never been to L.A. or California for that matter,"I found this really difficult to get through. While Davis's approach is very wide ranging and comprehensive, I often found myself struggling to keep up with all of the historical examples and various people mentioned in this account. Having never been there myself and knowing next to nothing about the area's history, I often felt myself overwhelmed, struggling to keep track of the various people and institutions that helped shape such a fractured, peculiarly American locale. I think it would have helped if I'd read a more general history of the region first before diving into something this intricately informed about its subject"
4,A Radical Take On the Microcosm of California in relation to the Macrocosm of America,"Mike Davis has mastered the linguistic game of authorship. He's writing style demands a high level of awareness to wit and sarcasm. The references, as the woman had said, are stated in way that encourages you to study further. The leftist argument is a bit understated. This is radical beyond negative connotations and stereotypical political stigmas. A book worth reading especially given the economic climate and the underlying tone of superficiality found within America. Don't let his dense articulation overwhelm you. I put this book down once out of intellectual apathy for his dense vernacular but picked it up and can't put it down. It's easing that political vindication I have against our socio-economic system and this vicariousness is only creating higher anticipation to flip the pages."
4,THREE BLONDES IN HIS LIFE,THE PERFORMERS ARE SEXY. THE NOSTALGIC ATOMOSPHERE IS SUPERBELY DEPICTED. WE COULD TRAVEL 50 YEARS AGO.
2,Not as good as Gran Riserva!!!,"This is distinctly different than Gran Riserva! While this is good balsamic vinegar, it is not great. We had previously purchased Fattoria Estense's Gran Riserva in the short squat bottle (same # of oz)and it was amazing. This vinegar is much sharper and thinner. It does not have the thick sweet quality of the Gran Riserva. The Gran Riserva you could easily serve on ice cream - this, no."
4,A historical treasure,"All lovers of traditional Irish music of the 20th century should own this CD. Most of it was recorded towards the end of his life, tragically cut short by lung cancer, but the fire of his musical soul bursts out of your speakers anyway. Many of Cooley's interpretations have become definitive for traditional musicians and as such this is a necessary source."
2,What does this have anything to do with Clannad?,This is not Clannad. It should not be listed under Clannad.
4,"Informational, But Somewhat Lacking","I really enjoyed reading this book because the author provides a quick and concise approach to Cleopatra's history. However, almost none of the author's personal statements are backed up by primary sources. The author also fails to inform the reader about discrepancies in her history, he simple presents them as fact. He claims that Cleopatra had 4 siblings instead of 5 and that she went to Rome twice instead of once. These are two pieces of information which cannot be proven and which are still greatly debated among Ptolemaic historians. Cleopatra VI is ignored completely. I also found it odd that the author Hellenized some of the ancient names but left others intact. (Example: Berenice became Berenike and Cyrenaica became Kyrenaika, and yet Cleopatra did not become Kleopatra)."
5,Great!,"The music is as colorful as the artists. I've had the pleasure of seeing them several times live at the Grog in Newburyport, MA over the past couple of years. They've still got it and it's fresh every time. This album is just a taste of what the Colbys are cookin'!"
3,Disappointing capture mode and file management,Looked good at first. The Demo is awesome. But the management of files in the projects is very confusing and unlike regular MS Windows method. I want to be able to clear out the project and start over with something new but have trouble starting a new project and puting the clips in the new project. The video capture was disappointing because there is no sound during the capture. Preview and Playback is ok though. After capturing a clip the screen would not even show the next capture without unplugging the firewire cable and re-inserting. Using the timeline to trim the clips was awkward. There has to be something better than this. Shame for a programmer to put so much effort into a product but fail to make simple and basic things easy for the first time user. I'll have to go back to arcSoft ShowBiz without so many options. PC I'm using Win XP Pro on is Athlon 2100+ and Canon ZR40 Mini DV. wilsonbusn@cox.net
1,Does Magix write these reviews?,"This has got to be the WORST movie editing program in the world... I had this 2 years and used on 3 computers, it flat out SUCKS golfballs through a drinking straw!!!!!!!!! It hangs, doesnt save ...vido audio sync problems, exported files dont work... I try to give it chances from time to time, but, I tossed the disks in the garbage the other day...Magix Movie Edit Pro version 11 works just fine...and is stable (sort of)This is my ZERO star review if i could choose that little..."
2,"cool, but didn't work","The tutorial looked pretty cool, but you couldnt use the program with a USB connection, only with a firewire, so this product turned out to be absolutely worthless."
5,Great Transaction,I received my book. The condition was excellent. The book arrived very promptly and was as described. This book contains lots of information. I am very happy with this book. I have started reading already and the book contains discriptions of some plants that you would not find in newer books. Excellent for reference.
1,Total waste of money,"I agree with the other reviewer who gave 1 star for this book. I have no idea where the other reviewers are coming from. This book is extremely superficial. If you are a graduate level student trying to learn how to model or solve business, economics, and finance problems using Matlab I cant' see how this book will be of any use to you. Even if you are just seeking a very basic introduction to these topics, this book is way too expensive given the content. You can learn more from wikipedia."
1,Poor,"A superficial book that mentions everything from fuzzy logic to Ito's lemma and knows what a Main Street economic consultant would. (I am not seeking to disparage a profession, only to define an area of expertise). It fails completely as far as Matlab and Simulink are concerned: the code is sketchy, and model diagrams sufficiently incomplete and uncommented to be useless. The positive reviews by self-identified doctoral students invite sad thoughts."
5,disc 1 = house disc 2 = electro,"the album is a winner through my eyes.disc 1, a mix of house by andrew weatherall of 2 lone swordsmen.disc 2 is killer, 19 solid electro tracks, and a few more 4X4 tunes thrown in there, it has some of my fav tracks such as voice stealer's unintensional, aaron carl, kit builder, mike dread's 98k live, model 500 & I-F's classic space invaders are smoking grass. get this, you will not be disapointed."
2,I guess it's good if you like house...,"This collection doesn't hold a candle to the first two in the series. While vol 1 and vol 2 were way-out breaks, acid, hip-hop and dancehall, this installment is nothing but house. House, house and more house. If you're like me and got sick of the stuff in 1994, don't bother. If you need 140 minutes of 4-4 beats, feel free.I must say that this is good house, but nothing more. Buy either of the first two installments. You won't be disappointed."
1,one of my least favorite Nightmares' albums,"To me, this album is much more raw mixing/DJing and much less a finished product of melodic songs. I'd recommend Smokers Delight or Carboot Soul over this one."
4,Average,I admit I've only used this a couple of times so its no wonder that I'm not getting any darker. It feels nice but does smell like sunblock...I guess its better than smelling like those sunless tanning lotions.
2,Don't pay too much for these!,"I wouldn't recommend them to anybody but a hard-core Jackie junkie. Neither of these movies has much (if any) of the trademark Chan humor. He had no control here--he was just a tool of the Evil Lo Wei. ""New Fist of Fury"" is pretty awful (so is ""Snake Fist Fighter""), but it's interesting to see Jackie in both of these before he had his eyes ""widened."" He's very winsome and charming (particularly in ""Snake Fist Fighter"") but Bruce Lee, he ain't! I would have liked ""Snake Fist"" better of the two movies, except that Jackie never finished it so the Evil Lo Wei used a double (blind-folded or seen from behind). However, in the scenes that Jackie shot, the movie is kind of touching, and Jackie's character is so sweet that I just wanted to adopt him (but then, I have sons that are older than Jackie was when he made this movie).These movies fall somewhere between ""Eagle Shadow Fist""(God-awful) and ""Drunken Master I"" (very watchable)."
1,Macrojunk,"Macrovision nonsense, that is the problem!My LVC-9016G justed ended up in the trash. Seriously.Waste of money - and never again will I buy a product from LiteOn."
1,Norma,I don't know how the LiteOn recorder works because I'm still waiting for the wiring which should have come with it. I ordered it on July 3rd. and this is September 2nd. and I'm still waiting for the wiring to be sent to me.
1,Not worth it!,"I purchased this product on a reputable website for electronics. When the product arrived, the dvd door would not open. The website I purchased I from told me I had to go through Lite-on. Lite-on told me I had to go through the original web site. Lite-on told me, based on the serial number, the product has already been refurbished once. After showing them the email from the original site stating the product was under Lite-on guarantee, Lite-on on finally agreed to fix the product. I had to pay for shipping and I followed the return instructions exactly. A few weeks later I called Lite-on and they said they they never received it and there is nothing they can do. So I am out the price of the DVD/VCR, the original shipping cost and the shipping cost to Lite-on, plus I have no product! Pay a little more and avoid having to deal with their customer service."
2,Works but no cigar...,"Received the product. Needed to replace the VCR that blew up with Coax Connection (entertainment center is packed). Didn't really need a 5th dvd player in it (best dvd player is phillips dvp642 and cheap). Turns out RF Out only works for passthru cable box. Will not play DVD or VHS tapes through RF Out. Would be nice if it had said that somewhere online, instead of finding out the hard way. Copy to copy is simple, but playback from PC made DVD's gives Disc Load error."
4,Blown Away,Loni Anderson stars as the mother who pits herself against a company of killers-led by her husband. Aided by a fearless pilot(John Heard of Betrayed) she storms her husband's Mafia compound in a desperate attempt tp rescue her captive child. There's only one force more powerful than the mafia... a mother's revenge.
4,Perfect for teens with a low tolerance for boredom,"I bought this book for my son who quickly loses patience with ""boring"" study guides. Even I found it funny in an irreverent sort of way, so I knew he would get a kick out if it. To make a long story short, it works!He found this book to be incredibly useful on the verbal sections as well as entertaining, and he felt a lot more confident about the test when he took it. He did say that if he followed the book's advice and also used the ""10 Real SATs"" from the College Board (which I also bought for him), along with this book, he thinks he could have done even better than he did. He did say the math section seemed a little thin but he still learned the techniques that helped him save time and reduced the ""anxiety"" factor that's been of his biggest problems on standardized tests. We will buy the new edition of UP Your Score before he takes the SATs again in October 2000."
4,Pretty Good,"I found that this book was written pretty well, however the math section is completely lacking. It does not get in depth in enough and the inane tricks and explantions were quite annoying. However, on the reverse side, the verbal section is great. The vocabulary words will give you an excellent start, and the tips are worthwhile. The frivolous comments in all sections were sometimes irritating, but I am just a serious person, so it may not irritate some of you. One last note, for the verbal section use Norman Lewis' Word Power Made Easy in combination with the vocab in this book, in addition to improving your vocabulary, it will give you tremendous edge over the students who have not read it."
3,Entertaining? Certainly. Helpful? ....A little!,"I've used two SAT books so far: Barron's and this one. And this one is by far the most entertaining. The jokes that are in it are hillarious at times (eg. ""find the area of the shaded thing; well, what the hell is it?""). The vocabulary section is probably the best thing going for it, although when I retook the SAT, I found several words on the test that weren't in the book. After using it, I found that I hadn't really learned anything except some vocab and guessing strategies, which you can find anywhere. I would be much easier on the book if I had improved more: I went from a 1250 to a 1280. Buy this if you have to choose between it and Barron's(which is insanely HUGE and very DULL)--but the best thing you can do is to practice SAT's on your own. These books are costly and they have nothing in them that you should have to pay money for."
5,I got a perfect on the SAT 2 writting,"I got a 1320 on the SAT... didnt study and didnt care.. i was still going to get into Cal anyway with my 4.7 gpa. But for the heck of it I bought this book and used it on the SAT 2 writing test.. That was a fine day. A 700 in us history, a 750 on the Ic... and a perfect on the writing test. thanks"
3,ok,"I might like this video better if the actual video part was there - seriously, I'm listening to the lady talk but the video keeps fluctuating between fuzzy black and white and no video signal at all. The production values seem pretty low when the rare moments of imagery do pop up - I wonder if way back wherever it originated from someone just dubbed it from tape to tape (it seems like it started as an old VHS) and maybe it was partly magnetized by accident?Other than that the video does seem to dwell a lot on festivals and side-stories that, while, nice, seem to keep it off topic for a bit too long. I think some maps and lists to lead-in and/or summarize would've helped me, but maybe that's just my personal learning style."
4,A great read!,"This book is above average for Star Trek novels. It has two seperate stories going on at once, which I liked. A good ""break"" from my other reading. I would highly recommend this one."
3,Uneven blend of stories,"An interesting combination of two different but related stories. The all consuming nature of prejudice and xenophobia is cleverly depicted in the ""plague story"" - 5/5, but the story about the consequences of breaking the prime directive was disappointing and predictable. The Villains were too unrepentently evil to be taken seriously. -2/5."
2,Pleasing but not thrilling,"The twin stories of this book are entertaining and interesting - although not exactly enthralling. However, it's not very well written; Peel's descriptions are often rather pedestrian. The book is, in many places, quite repetitive. I also don't think John Peel has got the hang of the characters' - they don't speak like themselves - although I do think he accuately captured their moods. Overall, it's a decent book which could have been greatly improved by more careful editing (as I've found with many Star Trek novels)."
4,An excellent book!,"I really like this book. The two stories were balanced really well, and I enjoyed the crime/mystery scenario surrounding the plague storyline. Buy it ... if you like Star Trek books with lots of character interaction, dealing with alien races and a story line that keeps you guessing. Don't buy it ... if you like lots of action, space battles and things getting blown up."
4,The best ST:NG book I've read in a long time.,"For the most part I found this book to be very interesting and exciting (especially the assassination story). There were however two things that didn't make sense to me - 1. I couldn't accept Deanna as some kind of undercover agent (has she ever done anything like that in the series or movies?) 2. Why didn't Riker and the others get sub-cutaneous locators so that they could have been beamed off of Grell's island? It might have presented a problem if they were caught and the locators discovered, but the risk of being caught was greater if they had to carry Maria Wallace."
4,Enjoyable quick read,"I wouldn't exactly call this fine literature, but it's short length and decent story made for an enjoyable read. As noted in another review, some of the main characters appear to act unlike how we'd expect them to act.But other then a few minor gripes, take this book for what it is...mostly mindless entertainment during a relaxing summer weekend."
2,GROWING RAPIDLY,"and there were absolutely NO instructions included specifically for the Ginkgo Bonsai - most importantly when and how to prune, how large it will get, etc. None of these questions can be found in books either. Currently, it is 28"" tall which I consider rather tall for a bonsai I've had for less than 1 month but I don't know what to expect. The pot is pretty."
5,"Love puzzles with an uplifting theme, this is for you.","These puzzles are beautiful works of art. Tom Dubois is a favorite of ours. Three are completed. The largest puzzle is very difficult. You must have patience and a desire to see the finished product. Just finished it this morning and it is a beautiful image. So now 3 are done. Saved the best to last, the actual Nativity. It has lots of detail and color so will be more interesting to complete."
1,STAY AWAY!,"The volume control gives up after about 2 yrs of sevice, you will have no control of the volume at all."
2,Doesn't Work,"Only half the speakers work that came in the package i recieved. At first, only two worked but my friend who knows how to fix speakers got the main one to work, but two of them still didn't work. Just be careful when buying from someone who has a return policy that doesn't ever allow for returns."
4,A French Jazz House Compilation!,"Jazz house delights on track 3, CASSIOS THEME, the sexually charged slow jazz hous number. Listen for the horns and the moans and that whisper, ""Cassio"". Kevin Yost works his jazzy house magic on track 8, EL CAMINO PT1, by Shazz. Blaze also deliver their rendition of the perfect jazz house fusion on track 12, DIRECTIONS. This instrumental number soothes the soul. Listen for the chant ""Directions"""
1,don't bother...,A much better solution is a flanned backed tablecloth (about $2) or a shower curtain liner. This mattress pad lasted less than a month - it ripped very easily. Waste of money.
4,Nice for lugging things around,"My son likes to sort and put things into various buckets, purses, etc. So this bucket has been great for him. He enjoys Bob the Builder so its totally appropriate and he likes to put various items in it and walk around the house with it."
5,Loved it!,"I saw the made-for-tv version of this book called ""Hello sister, goodbye life"" or something like that. The movie was just so-so, but I liked the story and thought the book would be even better. I loved the book. The added romance was pretty cute. I am careful about my chick lit because it seems to either be great or just terrible. This book was great! Olivia grows up. Too cute!"
5,What a great book!,"This book touched my heart, and left me with such a great feeling inside for everybody involved."
5,LOVE THIS BOOK!,"This book is such a wonderful read. All the characters are so great, colorful, and unique. It's a true page turner with an ending that leaves you happy but longing to read more!!! I highly recommend it!!!"
5,"Smart, quick, and witty!","Sure, Freud could have a field day with Olivia's love life - but, the story was intriguing and the verbal repertoire between characters was great fun to read. The author has a knack for getting the reader to empathize with multiple characters."
5,Modern-day Austen,"What an amazing story! The characters are reminiscent of Jane Austen, but brought up-to-date. The main characters are well-developed, and the dialogue is intelligent and witty. The moments between Olivia and her clueless, psycho mother are hilarious. This is a fantastic book!"
1,Oh boy...,"ANOTHER ""women's fiction"" book that preaches the creed that ALL women must be self-sacrificing, child-loving MOMMIES or they are EVIL sinners. Why would any sane person demand that a twenty-one year old student be forced to take in a CHILD and raise him/her? Hello? Really? Is that the ONLY way to be a GOOD person?"
5,THE PRINCE OF DARKNESS,"Horror of DraculaSAW THE MOVIE, ONCE AGAIN, FROM MY DAD'S COLLECTION. CHRISTOPHER LEE IS CINEMA'S GREATEST COUNT DRACULA. SCENE AFTER SCENE STAYS IN THE MEMORY: HARKER(JOHN VAN EYSSEN)ENTERING THE TOMB OF THE SLEEPING VAMPIRE WOMAN, AND DRIVING A STAKE INTO THE BEAUTIFUL CREATURE'S HEART; AS THE STAKE ENTERS, A WELL OF BLOOD GUSHES INTO THE CAMERA AND, TERRIFYINGLY, SHE IS TURNED INTO A HIDEOUS OLD CRONE, AS DEATH FINALLY OVERTAKES HER. HARKER LOOKS UP IN TRIUMPH, ONLY TO FIND THAT THE SUN HAS NOW GONE DOWN, LEAVING HIM TRAPPED WITH DRACULA. IN AN ENDING OF SHEER CINEMATIC MAGIC, CUSHING USING A CRUCIFIX CREATED OUT OF TWO CROSSED CANDLESTICKS, FORCES LEE INTO THE POOL OF SUNLIGHT. THE COUNT DISINTEGRATES HORRIBLY, UNTIL ALL THAT IS LEFT ARE SOME STRANDS OF HAIR, SOME DUST, AND THE CRIMSON SIGNET RING OF DRACULA REFLECTING THE SUNLIGHT."
3,Very Overrated,"This film is way overrated. I can understand how people think this is great, only because it is the first Hammer Dracula film. Personally the movie is uninteresting to me."
2,not the best of peter cushings work.,its not very good its tipical and tiresm after a bit it just seems to drag on i have seen this great and wonderful actor do such great work in his movies that this is just him being faithful to the production company to even consider doing this film.
3,Is this in widescreen?,"Is this in widescreen? If so, I'm going to buy it. If not, I'm not going to buy it, unless it orginally came out in 4:3."
5,The Best of Hammer,This is without question the best of the classic Dracula movies and perhaps the best offering ever from Hammer studios. Loosly based on the Stoker novel this movie made Christopher Lee a star. Peter Cushing is nothing short of brilliant as Dr. Van Helsing and the scene in which he destroys Dracula (this time) is magnificent.
5,Horror of Dracula,Probably the greatest Dracula film of all time! When I first saw this movie it was at the beach with my mom and I didn't know what was going to happen so it was pretty creppy. But as the end got nearer it was probably the best ending yet when Abraham Van Helsing (Peter Cushing)pulled down the curtains when it was dawn and it destroyed the mighty Count. But any how all of the actors did well with their parts and Terence Fisher directed it with his usual know-how.
3,Aspect ratio problem,"Great movie of its type, but there is a problem with the transfer. In many shots the tops of the actors' heads are cut off, and in some shots it seems their legs are cut off as well (less noticeable). IMDB says the original aspect ratio was 1.66:1, which is about 15:9. Amazon says the aspect ratio is 1.85:1, which is about 17:9. I saw this movie on a 16:9 monitor. Did they get a 4:3 print, then cut off the top and bottom to make it 16:9? I would have preferred to see the entire movie. Audio commentary by a movie historian would have been nice as well."
5,Classic and Cult,Horror of Dracula is one of the best Hammer's film and brings Christopher Lee's finest acting. The art direction is powerful and the technicolor cinematography is ashtonishing. Horror of Dracula is Cult and classic at the same time.
3,"Horror of Dracula, but where are the extras????","I think this is a great film and I have it on VHS. When it came out on DVD I was very excited and thought It would have a lot of extra bonus material - No such luck No commentary, no behind the scenes footage nothing that would give you a historical meaning for the making of this remake. I was very dissappointed at the lack of the bonus material. As a side note, in the ending of the film there is more footage when Dracula is destroyed I am supprised that was not put back in the film. Cuts were made and should have been put back when it was released on DVD."
5,The Best Vampire Movie Ever!,"My favorite horror movie of all time--probably my favorite film period--is this classic Hammer horror film. I like this picture so much because it captures the spirit of Stoker's novel better than any other version. Dracula is portrayed as a ruthless, sexual predator--he is not just a mysterious nobleman ala Lugosi or (even further off the mark) a tragic romantic hero ala Langella, et al. Christopher Lee makes the most out of his six minutes of screentime, and Peter Cushing is great as the heroic Dr. Van Helsing. I also like Michael (Alfred in BATMAN) Gough and the gorgeous Valerie Gaunt. James Bernard's music is terrific, the best ever in a horror picture; and can anything top the wonderful finale? Don't miss HOD!"
2,Whose idea was it ??,"If there was ever a Christopher Lee film that deserved full dvd treatment, this film is surely it. Though it is great to have Lee's vampire masterstroke on dvd, its utter lack of any worthwhile extra is highly suspect.Who decides to virtually stuff truly third-rate Christopher Lee Dracula films such as ""Scars of Dracula"" w/extras while at the same time taking ""Horror of Dracula"" and doing next to nothing at all but the transfer?? This glaring ommission is no doubt intentional, and those responsible should find other employment where cheating people isn't frowned upon. Perhaps they might enjoy cutting government funding for the arts.Those who buy dvd's for supplemental material will be sorelydissapointed."
5,Really Excellent!,"I'm currently in a film class about vampires and I had to watch this for it. So far, the best film I've seen. Lee is an amazing, alluring Dracula that maintains the scare factor. The character of Van Helsing also really comes into its own here, as this is one of the earliest times we see him as anything more than a scientist who can stake a vampire in the daytime. Lots of action, vivid sets and colors, and all around flawless acting make this one of the true Dracula classics. Well worth watching."
5,Drac Gets Hammered...,"Christopher Lee is Dracula, cool and wolf-like, bearing his razor-sharp canines as he mesmerizes the ladies! Peter Cushing is Van Helsing, the expert nosferatu-hunter, bent on Dracula's total annihilation. Together, they are the negative / positive poles of this gothic tale of bloodletting and possession by Hammer studios. The screenplay turns the original Stoker novel inside-out with excellent results. I had expected to hate it, but ended up enjoying HORROR OF DRACULA more than most vampire epics. Michael Gough (Batman, Sleepy Hollow) is perfect as the suspicious husband of Mina and brother of Lucy, who both succumb to the Count's alluring gaze and sinister bite. Can he help Van Helsing to destroy Dracula before he destroys them? Watch and see! Highly recommended..."
5,OUTSTANDING,"This is simply the greatest Dracula film of all time. Christopher Lee is outstanding as Dracula. He delivers one of the best performances of his career in this film. Peter Cushing plays his adversary, Dr. Van Helsing and is the perfect antagonist to Dracula. If you enjoy this film, I would also suggest Dracula Prince of Darkness, and the Brides of Dracula."
5,Christopher Lee's Greatest Horror Role,"This film marked a new beginning for vampire movies being in color and actually showing stakings. Christopher Lee was savage and yet sexual in his approach to his victims, combining the suaveness of Bela with a beastial attitude. ""Dracula"" as this film is known in the UK, was a great success for Hammer Films and led to six sequels. The cast is well chosen and they play their roles to the hilt. I believe this is the best Dracula movie ever made. I highly recommend it to anyone."
3,A Reluctant Purchase,"Can't say anything about the actual film contents and style that hasn't been said before: Christopher Lee IS the Count to me and always will be. That being said, I'm saddened by the fact that Warner was the distributor of this film. While, yes, the movie is 44 years old, I found the picture to be grainy and the mono sound? Don't get me started. Why is it that a movie like _Scars of Dracula_ on Anchor Bay is a 2 disc set and at least looks really good, and _HOD_ is treated this way with amateurish special features?! The only reason I bought this movie was for what it is, and so that hopefully one day Warner may realize that there was enough support for the DVD to warrant a re-release that does this great film justice."
3,Hammer Horror,"This is a pretty decent version of the Drscula legend retold by Hammer to remake the classic Universal horror films. It was the first in a long series of Dracula films with Christopher Lee in the title role. This first one has Peter Cushing as Van Helsing. Lee actually didn't star in the first sequel- Brides of Dracula, but would return for Prince of Darkness and the other Hammer Draculas."
4,Hammer Time,I've been a fan of the Hammer horror films since I was a kid in the '60's. They are a worthy successor to the Universal horror films of the '30's and '40's.
4,"Classic vampire flick, well executed.","If you're a fan of the genre, you already know this is a classic, well made and well acted. Chillingly simple."
1,Why did I buy this?,"I like one, and only one song on this album. I don't know where my head was when I bought it. I have tried multiple times to listen to it but to no avail. I am glad I didn't spend much on it. Do not buy this unless you have no taste."
1,Boring x 2,"I agree with the other reviewer - boring. I wanted a great workout with a stability ball. This isn't it. If you're new to Pilates, perhaps. A great ball workout is '10 Minute Solution Pilates on the Ball' with Lara Hudson. You do the entire DVD, you will get a fantastic Pilates workout with results to match.Hello KittyCincinnati, OH"
1,Misleading title,"This book uses VERY editorial fashion photographs as examples... but does'nt explain the VERY complicated lighting. It shows a very basic diagram, thst looks to me like the author made up without the input of the actual photographer."
5,Four legged Family,"I have a dog that is part irish wolfhound. She is my best friend. Not thinking about our Texas weather (the a/c and heater can be turned on in a 24 hour period) her hair is coarse and thick. When she runs around in the woods and comes in contact with our poison ivy, sumac, etc. she almost scratches off all her hair. The vet recommended I try this food and it has made a difference. My best friend is not miserable anymore."
2,It would be great if it worked,"I bought this product based on the reviews from this site. While I see how this software certainly could be great (very powerful and easy to use) it failed me in two key areas:1.) For whatever reason, the AVI files from my Cannon Powershot S400 digital camera are not compatible with the Video Deluxe 2 Software. The Magix support staff, of course, blamed Cannon and provided no help whatsoever, even though the Cannon AVI files work fine with competitor software produced by Roxio and ArcSoft. Considering the popularity of Cannon cameras, this incompatibility is a major liablity.2.) Again, for whatever reason, the Video Deluxe 2 software crashes my computer every time I attempt to burn a VCD or DVD. Again, the Roxio and ArcSoft software work fine, so the problem is only with Video Deluxe 2.Despite downloading the most recent patch, it is a shame this software is so riddled with bugs. It certainly has tremendous potential if not for the bugs."
5,Great Product!,Works just as advertised. Multiple tracks for video and audio makes creating and syncing video easy. The burn to Video CD feature works like a charm as well as the mix to Mpeg feature. The only critisism that I have is that it doesn't allow you to capture video to an AVI file. It defaults to the Magix format which is a smaller file but not as good of quality as AVI. I use either Dazzle 80 or Virtual Dub (Freeware) to capture and then edit and mix-down on Video Deluxe 2.0 Plus.
2,Near Crap,"I dont know what to say, it is a headache to use at the least. It locks up, has poor video export formats that cant be read by other programs such as Windows media and Winamp and the audio, during Cam recording, doesnt work, It locks up the system where you'll need to do a COMPLETE REBOOT, cause Magix Video 2.0 wont close! Don't get me wrong, it can work, you just need to use the uncompressed export and an external compression conversion program....I downloaded version 12 (e-version) and it locked up and seemed worse than this... It seems easy to use, just things dont work or are missing, including the WMV export (has no options)...I dont know what would be better, maybe all video editing programs are clunky due to the size and non-standards in compression schemes....got me!!"
1,video deluxe 2.0 User Un-friendly,I found the product to complicated to try to use.Lots of lock ups and freeze's not worth the time.
1,DON'T BUY FROM AMAZON,"I apologize for giving such a low rating, but it's not the book I'm rating. It's amazon.THE BOOK IS WONDERFUL AND YOU SHOULD BUY IT.ONLY NOT FROM AMAZON....But from this website:[...]Brand new Copies, and infinitely cheaper than amazons USED copies..Happy trails!"
4,Stringed instruments,This was a very good book.it tells you everything you want to know about sringed insruments.Wether its a double bass you desire or a ukulele this book will help you learn about it
4,Good Mix of Old and New,"""Easy to read, easy to use games from around the world. Nice addition to any program using multi-national stories or or those tellers working in schools or groups needing some variety. Although some games are ""old hat"" you will find enough variety to make this book worth your while.""- Storyteller.net Review"
5,Great Snake,"Small, light, sturdy, inexpensive and noiseless, this is a great stage to main or recording room, etc, specific purpose snake. Highly recommended."
2,"Rambling, Dull & Badly Written.",This book rambled on through a fairly stupid vampire's angst. It started out well & then the plot went on a road-trip & never returned. It didn't even get into WHY her sister was killing musicians! What did it mean? Where was it going? What a waste of money. If only you could return books like you can return anything else you're not satisfied with!
4,Small Library Help,"Sager has revised and updated his previous book, SmallLibraries: Organization and Operations. The focus of the book isprimarialy for a person that has little or no library experience as it explains the basics of running an one or two person operation. It considers things as basic as checking-in and out of materials to guidelines when working with budgets and library venders. While this is a beginning manual for beginning librarians, it does offer great resources for all of us in its list of list-serves as well as other resources that I learned were not covered in library school. It gave information that I would find useful in budget management, personnel and board or commitee control, depending on the type of library. It is vague in explaining what should go into a specific type of library but does act as a great jumping off point for everyone that is new to librarianship."
2,not great,"I love Doug E Fresh, but this is not his best work. It doesn't even compare to his old albums.And Matt Fulton if you get his first albulm contact me ill definately buy it off of you."
5,fascinating,This is a fascinating book that combines brilliant legal scholarship with cultural studies and social theory. Rollins has done something wonderful here. His argument about the ironies and silences within legal discourse on AIDS is provocative and convincing. I highly recommend this book.
5,Buy it..,"..is's worth it. Definitely. Very well done ambient music. Hardcore BM's fan won't like, but those who dig in ambient gonna love it big time. Believe you me.."
5,A Masterpiece,"This is one of my all-time favorites. I originally bought this one back in about 1999. More recently, I bought a copy as a gift, hence today's review.This album is beautifully crafted. It is a surreal adventure into the musical world of Mr. Marley. It is a must-have for fans of ambient music, reggae, Bob Marley or dub."
2,"""Ambient Translations"", yes. ""In Dub"", no...","ZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzz....... Laswell's mixes take every one of Marley's grooves - from the lilting to the hard-edged and strangle them in a wall of WHOOOSSSHhhhh. Completely inappropriate treatments of Marley's music. Luckily, Bill seems to have learned his lesson, since the Miles ""Panthalassa"" remixes only hint at the ambient and manage to remain true to the original funk. Marley's stuff is still crying out for a worthy dubwise treatment."
1,"A bad idea, Marley's music is butchered.",This cd is the product of a poor ill-advised concept. Reggae is rhythm and this cd has none of it. Not recommended.
1,Why buy this when you can buy the real thing?,"This is just a regurgitation of Bob Marleys music presented in a dressed up, mainstream, cash-in on Bob marleys name. This is in now way representative of Bob or Reggae, don't waste your money on this. Calling this record 'dub' could be put down as false advertising...this is about as 'dub' as Nirvana..."
1,Please just stick to the roots of reggae,"I love Marley as much as the next Rasta, but please oh please, only listen if you are truly a fan of whale sounds and bird sounds to fall asleep to. This is an ambient translation alright. I think Bob would have loved to see this NOT happen. I am a true roots fan and my tastes go far beyond just Bob, but I do know when I am hearing something that doesn't belong on the shelf mixed with reggae. I wish people would just leave Bob's music alone. It's like adding Slayer's guitar work over the top of John Tesh's greatest hits and calling it Dreams of Carnage: A Satanic Translation of a dork's fairy music. Something like that. Well whatever...buy this if you want...don't go around saying that I didn't warn you!"
3,Dreams Of Freedom Could Have Been So Much More!,"Basically this C.d. is exactly what is says it is.It Has a very dream-like quality to it in the sense that all the songs are linked by ambient music.Not special amibient music just your typical soft-sounding type.Marley himself is to be heard singing on only one of the tracks.However the I-threes(backing singers)are on nearly all of them.THIS IS NOT A TRUE DUBWISE MAKE OVER.It is far more ambient than dub,so if that is what your looking for,stay away! A good choice of songs which could have worked well.Unfortunately the ambient music was too overdone for me.You get the feeling that it could have been done so much better by someone else.Is this a good example of cashing in on the Marley name,well I hope not.Peace."
5,This is the best book of veterinary acupuncture that I know that it is for sale for the internet.,"It is a simple and easy book of understanding, of the way that the students, in the course beginning, need to understand the Chinese medicine, mainly the acupuncture. But for an acupunturista he is also very useful, because it serves as much as a study book and of headboard as of fast consultation, in spite of his size to turn it a little difficult to transport. But I always drop it off at my clinic and I read it whenever it remains a time. Each reading that I do learns a little more. I already possess there is him two years and I still didn't get to read it entirely. It is the book that more has been contributing to my learning as acupunturist. I recommend and a lot to all that are interested in the subject: Chinese medicine and veterinary acupuncture."
5,Awesome,Interesting book which accounts for this ancient discipline applied to animals. It is reassuring to know that animals can be healed this way as well!
5,"Three Complete Books in one cover, NOT all sequential","Just as the Hornblower novels were not written in chronological order, this combination is #1, 2 and, I think, 5 (Not counting the short story ""Hornblower's Temptation"" in book ""H..during the Crisis""). Same with ""Indomitable Hornblower"" 3 novels in one cover, but not in sequence. Not knocking the Novels, but the concept seems odd"
5,Still shocking after all these years,"I recently read the new biography of Alice Sheldon, whose nom de plume was James Tiptree, Jr., and so I went back and re-read this book. Harlan Ellison once said something about ""the healing art of razor blade fiction"" and that's what Warm Worlds & Otherwise is -- razor blade fiction. No, my friends, it's just a fact that The Universe is not a friendly place and the long run plans of DNA may not include ""mankind."" James Tiptree, Jr., knew this, well, and got it across, written in blood. Don't miss this book.**"
4,good stuff!,My family and I really enjoy this on our chicken. It does not get mushy like Shake and Bake. Very crispy! We buy the pork variety as well.
3,Description Is Wrong,This is a great product but the description is wrong. There is only one packet of mix in each box. I love this item but is usually cheaper in all the chain grocery stores. The average price at the local stores in my area is 1.59 and you multiply that by 8 and its less than 13 dollars at retail.
4,The Big Storm,"A big storm rages through the night and causes lots of damage. Bob and Wendy get the calls and they head out fix things.At farmer Pickle's, a couple of the trucks notice the pond has to be cleaned out. But before they can get started, Pilchard the cat climbs a shaky tree and gets stuck upside-down right over the pond. The trucks rally with Bird to find Bob and Wendy. But in the end all is well.The book uses stills from the television show to illustrate the story. Each page has one picture that fills the whole page except the bottom where the text is. The text is a little clumsy. It reads like a transcript of the script with 'said Bob', 'said Muck', etc. stuck at the end of each line. But while a little clumsy to read the first time or two, the kids seem to really like it."
4,Industrial Tribal,"The merch guy at BellyDance Superstars steered us away from this album (""that one is more ... hard, this other one is more popular"") but if you enjoyed the industrial/goth tribal pieces in the current show, this IS the right album to get. Tribal Derivations by Beats Antique and Urban Dervish by Oojami are both good albums too (recommended!), but are not the same style."
1,Not my taste,"Ok, I bought this because I love Rachel Brice and her dancing buuuutttt...imagine being blind folded and riding along with your garbage truck driver. The sounds of falling coins, banging garbage can lids and creepy record player type sounds was not to my liking. It's just too weird. I'm attempting to listen to it in the hopes it will grow on me but its not looking good. bummer"
3,Eh...,"Not what I was expecting, though this is the first cd I bought from this band. Very circusy, but highly reccomended if you're into that kind of music."
2,Just a bit dull,"That's it really, I just found this album a bit dull. Not 'weird' or 'boundry breaking' or 'creepy'. Just plain old dull.I guess it might be a bit out there if you've never listened to experimental ambient music or electronica, but it you have, there's nothing much thats new here."
2,what the....?,"I bought this album mainly because I am a big fan of Rachel Brice, but also because I wanted something non-traditional to which to bellydance. There are only three tracks to which I would consider dancing. The rest sound like a construction site, with banging pipes, clinking chains and dropping coins(?)! Although I love tribal bellydance, and I am certainly attracted to the unique and unusual, (being decorated with various tattoos and piercings), I found this CD to be a little too ""out there""."
3,strange,"watched this film a couple days ago, and maybe because i'm getting older, i found it strange and sometimes difficult to follow. i got the basic story, i think, the young man is looking for someone and has visions about it, but only while being screwed. luckily for him he's working in the porn industry. the visions were not done very well, mostly they were about him being chased by a man wearing an all white mask with 2 eye holes. i am a big scf-fi & fantasy fan, but this did not fill the bill. there is a fair amount of sex going on but you see mostly his face and his visions during the sex. i found the cast, most of whom were supposed to be rent boys, to be good looking, the picture quality was good, but the script was lacking. i'm not sorry i bought this movie, but you would do just as well to rent it."
3,Should have been a ...,"Should have been a short film, maybe 30 or 40 minits long.I liked it; a bit preachy on hiv, but the message is a good one, the plot viable, the acting above average, and the theme of how the porn industry eat up and chewes up it's 'actors' and others working in the 'industry' metaphoric but with a ring of of trueth."
3,Ummm,"I liked it...but it was weird. I wasn't completely sure of what to make of it. This movie would however, make an awesome porno if it was more explicit."
1,Not worth seeing at any price,"An awful movie, poorly written, directed and acted. It doesn't know where to end. The music when not annoying is just downright nasty.Nothing to redeem this film, I endured it because I paid for it. Saw it through and so glad I didn't outright purchase it. A must not see."
1,Boring,"I tried to like this movie, really I did. The idea of someone searching for his long lost twin via psychic sex-induced visions sounds fun. At least you might expect there to be some decent sex scenes - and there are sex scenes. Unfortunately the pacing is too slow to keep one interested,the characters completely fail to catch you, the acting is insipid, and the dialogue sounds like a broken record. They just keep repeating the same lines over and over.The actors 'are' pretty, but that's not enough. And their continued assertions amongst each other that 'gay guys get to know each other through sex' is entirely off putting. So much so, I will admit I only got through about 45 minutes of this one. Which surprised me, I thought it had been at least an hour and a half.All in all, save yourself the time and go watch something else."
5,"Groundbraking, earthshaking!","How good is this album !? This is one of the best albums i've ever heard. It's ranking up there with Nellyville and Justified, choreographed music at it's best. If you take old metal kings Metallica and their new album and compare it with Mastodon, it's laughable. Mastodon pukes all over everybody and everything. There is not a second of bad music here.I must get new trousers.PS. I saw them live before i had heard them, and their performance will make Neil Young look like Iggy Pop and/or Rolling Stones."
5,"Holy ..., this is good....","This is a must-own for any heavy music fan.Elements of maiden, kyuss, sabbath, botch, even a couple straight-up blues licks hiding in the mix.The drummer is a monster, but clearly a little too impressed with his own abilities. Use a little restraint, dude (but only a little!)."
5,"This is what is known as ""heavy metal""","In contrast to a recent review of mine in which I labeled Linkin Park as textbook ""pop"" music, this is textbook metal. This is really a landmark metal album; in my opinion, one of the best of the new millenium. What I love about this album is that it is not typical metal fare. These guys aren't just satisfied with tuning their guitars down low and slamming out metal chords. This album has some great lead guitar work, as well as a few prolonged instrumentals.""Crusher Destroyer"" and ""March of the Fire Ants"" are the songs that get the most attention, but there is so much more to this release. Try ""Ol'e Nessie"" and the other two previously mentioned songs, and you've got a pretty good idea of what to expect from this album. If you like those songs, you'll love this album. If you don't, you're probably a Linkin Park fan, in which case, what are you doing here anyway?"
5,Anger preceeds their footsteps,"This album is on the best releases in metal of the last few years, everything about it is good, agression, melody, great lyrics, great artwork, great musicianship and of course great songs. EVERY music is good, there are no let downs in the album, you could choose randomly and have a great single for this record.When you come across one of the many parts of melody through out the record you know it will lead to a great burst of heavyness, and when the music is tearing everything apart you know it will end in a beautiful, melodic part.The voice fits perfectly the sound of the band, the guitar work is perfect, and the drumming is insane. Everything works for a memorable record.Mastodon and Remission have everything to crush all other metal releases around them."
4,Remission,Overall the condition of the cd was great. I had no problems with it at all. It was shipped quickly and effeciently. Too bad the music itself was a disappointment.
5,this album is weird but the musicianship is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,mastodon is one odd band but the music they create is raw and its true piece of art the music they make is art at its best this album is one of my favorite albums the other albums they have made are amazing as well ill always be a fan of mastodon this band gives me hope that their are real musicians out there!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and mastodons musicianship is amazing on all their albums
5,EXELENT,"IF YOU REED THE PRODUCT DETAILS IT SAYS 1 LP , BUT IT'S NOT! I GOT 2 PURPLE LP'S WITH THE BEST SOUND THAT NO CD CAN GIVE , KILLER COVER, I CAN'T BELIVE THIS IS THE FIRST LP MASTODON DID, EXELENT!"
4,Mastodon's Heaviest Album,"This is by far Mastodon's heaviest album. Tracks like ""March of the Fire Ants"" and ""Burning Man"" showcase a sludge/post-hardcore sound, but this is far from a traditional metal album. Tunes like ""Ol'e Nessie"" and ""Trilobite"" are where Mastodon shows how deep they are musically with free flow, jazz infused, organic rythm. Stylistically this album has little in common with their later releases. I'll admit, this isn't my favorite Mastodon album (artistically I think it's the weakest of the four), but it has moments of creativity which showcase the potential later realized onLeviathan,Blood Mountain, andCrack the Skye. This is by far one of the most talanted bands in the New Wave of American Heavy Metal. I'll admit I'm not a fan of the vocals on Remission, but the music more than makes up for whatever the band lacks in the lyric and vocal department."
4,Metal Poetry,"This album sounds like Art. I would have given it 5 stars had I written this review Before hearing ""Leviathan,"" but that album is so much better sounding that by contrast, this is four stars. Both are incredible, as is Mastodon. A lovely young woman I have the joy of working with introduced me to these guys, so I've only been a fan a short time, but so far its all been an incredible experience. I can't say they're my favorite, but at the moment, of all the Metal bands I've been listening to lately, these guys are on top. They're not just loud, they have a style that is quite unique; and their lyrics are an usual bunch. In both ""Remission"" and ""Leviathan"" I'm noticing a pattern to what the songs are about, if they are about anything...which is good. It is Poetry in the form of Heavy Metal, and they pull it off magically. Musically I can't say much, as I am not a musician. All I can do is bring about the old cliche phrase:""I may not know (metal), but I know what I like...and I like this."""
5,Masodon - Remission,"Mastodon does it again, this time with their first full length edition cd. Mastodon has a great sound, mixing the technical with the heavy. Every song is worth a head bang at some point. Their drummer is especially talented, and provides a great back drop. The lyrics are good. The vocals sound great for the music, but unfortunatelyt, mastodon focuses heavy on the musicianship and there really aren't enough vocals at times. However, this is highly ignorable because the musicianship is fantastic. All in all, this is a great band, and should be looked into by any fan of the metal genre."
1,Great Cover Art - But This Album Stinks,"The title of my review says it all. I want to be a rock star too. I think what I will do is go get me some amplifiers, musical instruments, and a jackyl. Then, I will puncture the jackyl's wind-pipe, set fire to the equipment, and then record the gurgling howls and firey explosions - and sell it to Mastadon fans for $15 a disk. I'll make a killing! People will say, ""Oh, that Robert Barnett is such a technical musician,"" or they'll say ""Man, all those jackyl noises, he must truly be a dedicated and emotional musician."" Folks, this is not heavy metal - hell, this isn't even music. If you are a hard core Mastadon fan, you need some serious help - or as I like to call it, ""metal rehab."" Get yourself some Black Sabbath, Cathedral, and Pantera albums, get a good buzz going, find someone willing to have some good sex - and let the rehab begin.Mastadons belong in museums, not on stage."
1,poor quality,"I was disappointed in this fragrance. It did not smell fresh when I applied it. It must have been old stock. You have to be careful when purchasing any cosmetics or fragrance that you can't try or see, especially when it sells for a much lesser price."
4,"Highsmith, a master of psychological suspense!","On the surface this book deals with two men at opposite ends of society, the criminal and the police office. Beneath the surface both men are misfits and loners, the criminal obviously so, the police officer, not so apparent. Both men are drawn into a vortex, helpless to resist their own compulsions. In many ways this book is reminisent of ""Strangers On A Train""."
3,Basic Common Sense,"This is mostly just basic common sense that never works these days. Don't confront them right after they woke you up, be diplomatic, write a letter, etc. Usually your local cities' web site will have information very similar on how to deal with neighbors."
3,Everything you ever wanted to know about boundaries,If you've ever had neighbors then you are bond to have differences in one facet or another- whether it be a tree or noise or the property line. This book details the tree and boundary issue very well. The part where I felt it fell short (only a little) was when it came to noise and animals. I know they have a book devoted to dogs but I would have liked to see even a snippet covered since dogs can be quite an issue in turning good neighbors into a war. Other that this it is a clear and concise book including references on the aspect of boundaries and trees.
5,A must have book for homeowners,"I have been having problems with neighbors and disputed property lines. This book will give you ideas and helpfull hints to a peacefull end. If you bought a home, ,property (land) you owe it to yourself to read this book."
4,Wealth of Information,This product has come in handy for several questions I've had regarding the 'right thing to do' with neighbor issues. From ownership of a fence to who is responsible for having a tree removed. This book will help you be a better neighbor and avoid unreasonable disputes.
3,"Diverse, yet Detailed","This book takes a very rich topic and divides it up without losing specificity.The most interesting thing is that it manages to discuss issues that I would not even have thought to be a problem, such as who gets the fruit if it lands in a neighbor's yard?The difficult part of the book is that it is forced to speak generally, as many of these laws vary, sometimes greatly, between the states. Yet, it manages to go into sufficient detail to most likely provide a reader the answer that he/she seeks. I found it particularly helpful that the book, in the appendix, lists, state by state, the statute dealing with a few tricky issues.This book is diverse yet detailed, making it not only an educational read, but mildly entertaining to read about some of the spats that can, and do, come between neighbors."
4,Best Buy for Every Day Wine Use,"I was impressed by this new arrival because of the Brand name ""Reidel"" and was looking for a glasss for ""drop in"" guests and summer cookouts and these four glasses fit the bill perfectly! This way if I break one on my tile floor I won't ""burst into tears"" at the loss knowing I got a great deal on Amazon. Com and if ""someone"" breaks one, I'll order another 4 for backup! These will be great for lunches, packing in a picnic basket for summer outings and simple but nice for casual entertaining."
2,These are too shrinky-dinky to count as real wine glasses,"Read the dimensions carefully on this one because the picture makes them look like real wine glasses. They're not! They're tiny little taster glasses that can't hold a proper 5 ounce pour without being too full to benefit from the fancy shape (too little head space for proper bouquet or slosh-free swirling).If you just want cute little wine glasses you can get them much cheaper and they'll work just as poorly. If you want proper wine glasses to do all that sniffing and swirling you need ones that are much bigger.Yeah, this is the same review I put for the red ones, I bought both at the same time without looking carefully at the dimensions because they looked normal (shape-wise yes, size-wise no)."
5,very pleased,The product was everything I wanted and expected. It was shipped quickly and securely packaged. I will continue to buy from amazon and its vendors. I have never been disappointed.
1,Don't Waste Your Money on the White Wine Glasses,"I got the package deal, 4 white and 4 red wine glasses. The white wine glasses have too small an opening to be of any use to a real wine drinker, since you can't get your nose ""in"" to smell the wine and that is the essence of wine tasting. The reds are okay, but I'll be using them for white wine (when I opened the box, I first thought the reds were the white wine glasses!). I have Reidel crystal wine glasses (which cost a small fortunate and were received as wedding gifts many years ago) and was looking for a cheaper alternative (due to breakage over the years), but I doubt I will ever use the white wine glasses."
1,Ugly,"Quite possibly the most overpriced crappy wine glasses anyone could find. They're exactly like the wine glasses you'd find at a hotel bar -- short, with a rolled lip, and designed to be washed in a dishwasher over and over. Heavy and indestructible. Not what I think of when I think of crystal."
2,What Happened?,"Who is Joe Pizzulo and Leza Miller? I was wondering for the longest time who did this song, and I was like, Sergio Mendes? a guy from an old Brazilian group? this doesnt make sense. I just found out that they were one-hit wonders (Pizzulo, and Miller) oh well, Great song from 1983!"
3,Read this for a class,Helpful in laying out a reading plan including justifying why you should lay out a plan. Good enough book that I donated it to a local library in the hopes that others would find it of value.
3,Good examples but poor organisation!!,This book is good for finding examples of autographs and there are plently of them. the problem is that the book is in REALLY bad order. There seems to be no way to easily navigate around it. And as for the information it gives you on 'Advanced Autograph Collecting' it is fairly basic stuff that most collector that have been doing this would already know. The only reason to buy this book is for the examples but be prepared for lots of page flicking.
4,No windows 7 driver (64bit),"I am sure this is a no-frills durable product, but not having a windows 7 driver I can't get it to install in the first place. I find it unacceptable, being a month out, with several months in beta/RC this product should have a driver. It is not as big a leap from xp->vista as vista->7 so I am dissapointed with Unotron."
5,Solid product,The Unotron Sac2 smart card reader works well with Windows Vista (64). I currently use it with my military CAC card(common access card). I installed the required software (provided by military) and windows automatically found and installed the required driver for me. The installation process was very straightforward and the card reader has worked perfectly.I haven't tried washing it yet.
1,Does not age well,"Maybe three years ago I might've recommended this four-song EP, but with The Faithful Anchor and Marionette out there, skip it. Johnathon Ford has done much better since this little experiment."
2,Nice Dress Belt - Long term issues,"This is a nice belt. Not quite as shiny as they make it look in the pictures. Maybe not worth that much money either, but only time will tell with that. I like the belt just fine overall. At 50 bucks it would have been 5 stars.Edit: Over time this belt has developed a crack at the hole where the prong protrudes. This started to occur at about 16 months in. I have $20 belts that do not do this after 10 plus years, so I'm not too happy about this belt doing that. Have to downgrade. I have since switched to the Allen Edmonds standard wide belt (1 1/2 inch), and it is going strong after 6 months. Did not buy it on amazon, but I'm sure you can find it here."
2,"This film needs serious editing or ""Please turn on the lights.""","I almost gave up watching this DVD as every scene was so dark. You could barely see the faces. Out of doors was fine. What was the producer thinking. Made correctly, this could be a wonderful film. The acting fine, the plot fine, the filming dreaddful."
2,Not what I was expecting,"This movie was a decent effort, but I was a little disappointed by how it ended, and how (SPOILER ALERT?) some story lines weren't really wrapped up. And just a warning, there's a bit in this movie that would probably get it a PG-13 rating in the US. A little different from some of the other BBC movies I've seen."
1,Not worth the time or bother,"While the actors involved were first rate, there was nothing for them to do but wallow in one of the worst scripts I have ever seen produced by PBS. The various plots remained undeveloped and often, pointless. One kept hoping that some turn in the plot would make sense - it never did! I would never watch this again or recommend it to a soul. The scenery was lovely, but does not make up for the horrendous story."
2,"Disappointing , depressing and disjointed","I wish I could write a more positive review but I really feel only 2 1/2 stars is the best I can do. The plot of South Riding would do Thomas Hardy proud except that he would have filled in the spaces. There were so many possibilities here that were not explored adequately or at all and were brought to a hurried and jumbled end, and of course the overall tenor was grim. I did like the actors--especially Anna Maxwell-Martin.. All the central characters were well acted-- David Morrissey and Penelope Wilton were both memorable but were constricted by the script. I would very much like to see more of Maxwell-Martin because she is new to me. The scenery was, as many have noted, stunning, and it certainly got across the dismal quality of life in that era. However, there were just too many dangling story lines and too many things happening without adequate leadin or explanation, and it really was sooo depressing."
3,Slow Starter and Very Depressing,"I attempted to watch this twice before I could get into it. The beginning is slow. It's filmed in low light and done in dark tones so it starts out with a depressing feel as well. Once it got going, I was riveted however. I am not sure how that happened really. The acting was good. The scenery was spectacular. I don't think I've ever seen a movie based in 1930's England where poverty reigned so that bit of culture was also interesting, but it was just one big, depressing event after another. Many parts of the story went to fast and weren't thoroughly explained while others just meandered along, so the pacing felt really off to me- especially everything after the funeral. While I was very engaged in the story, it also felt very unsatisfying. It ends with this really happy music, but I was feeling like, ""What's that all about?"" The good things at the end did not make up for all the rest of it. All in all, it's a strange movie."
1,Parents Beware!,"I am a huge fan of BBC mini series usually but I got this film out of the library last night and as I was watching it with my daughter all of a sudden without warning there is a sex scene, back alley type, with sound effects etc. I was so very grieved and disappointed that they threw this in there of course involving a man of the cloth to make matters worse. I am sorry if they are going to have such adult scenes at least they could warn you instead I had to turn it off afraid to continue for fear of more of the same...badly done from a director that I have come to admire. I will try to preview EVERYTHING except Jane Austin in the future."
3,disappointed,"I felt like I wasted almost 3 hrs of my day. I think the series had good potential, but none of the stories were fully developed. Towards the end it felt rushed too. I was secretly hoping that one of the characters would suddenly show up from the dead, and there would be a happy ending, but... I give 3 stars for the beautiful scenery and for David Morrisey. I don't think I'll ever watch it again."
4,"""That's The Way They All Sound...ooo....""","That's The Way Love Goes was Janet's biggest hit on The Billboard Hot 100.This CD Single has 5 mixes and the LP Version. The mixes are all mixed by CJ Macintosh. He did a good job....sorta...The track listing is like this:1. CJ R&B; 7"" Mix (4:10)2. CJ R&B; 12"" Mix (6:16)3. CJ FXTC Club Mix 12"" (6:22)4. Macapella (6:22)5. CJ FXTC Instrumental (6:14)6. LP Version (4:26)OK, I like the R&B; Mixes, but the FXTC Mixes are too repetitive. The Macapella Mix sounds just like the R&B; Mixes, except the fact that there's hardly any music...And of course, the LP Version is fantastic!!!There are three versions of the single, one packaged in a jewel case (the version I reviewed), the version in a slimline jewel case (which has the LP Version as Track 1, which knocks the mixes down one), and the version in a digipak (which has the same tracklisting as the slimline version)."
4,my last fav Janet Jam,this was my cut back in 93 hard to believe it's been 15 years. Janet Jackson had a cut with this song that still packs far more punch than the majority of the tracks she has since put out since. this cut had a nice hybrid of styles that complimented her vocal stylings.the re-mixes are tight and on point.
2,No way CJ!,"I thought this particular single for That's the way love goes was pretty boring with the exception of the macapella mix. All of the remixes sound alike I guess CJ Macintosh was the only one willing to rebirth the song. Another cd single was released for this song that contained better mixes simply called ""We Aimsta Win"" mixes done by Hank Shocklee (which had more of an urban sound for radio). One of the remixes can be heard on the 2 cd janet. album set that also contained a book. The album version of this song is a classic and when that happens who needs a remix?"
3,Slightly repetative but a must for Janet fans...,"Being a diehard Janet fan, I was fairly pleased with this title. The CJ 7 and 12 inch R&B Mixes both gave a more R&B feel to a song that already has the sorta beats to make your booty move. However the club mix does not entirely work out well, as it remains fairly monontonus throughout. It works better in its purely instrumental format. The macapella offers yet another alternative, however towards the end, understandably it resembles the R&B versions of the track. Perhaps additional remixes could have been offered in place of some of the repeated tracks. And at an import cost, with exception to the diehard Janet fans, it would probably be more worthwhile to buy janet or janet: remixed."
5,Best starter for Jazz beginner,This album is a great starter album for someone who is just getting started in Jazz music. The variety of sound and presentations will capture your musical imagination and you will find yourself drawn more and more into jazz music.
4,"Slow, Expensive, but Arrived","The product is good. Overpriced, but good. The supplier was slow. Look for it locally if you can find it. It was recommended to me by a dermatologist as being very mild on the skin. I think it is. I'll probably order some more in the future, just from a different supplier."
1,DHS Clear Shampoo,"As I have very sensitive skin, this product was recommended to me by my dermotologist. Unfortunately, after having spent a fair amount of $$ to order/ship the product, it was not good for my scalp. I appear to be allergic to some ingredient(s) in the product - my scalp got dry, flaky and itchy within 24 hours of using (I tried using it 3 times to ensure the shampoo was the problem)."
1,Not what I expected,"I waited months for this book to find it's just full of black and white photo's of footballers, The wanted, Cheryl Tweedy's Chicken head, JLS, colonel gaddafi, Robbie williams, the cast of glee, Tinie Tempah, Little tempah, slightly larger tempah and really massive tempah.I was hoping for minge."
1,Meaningless Abstract Scribbles,"I truly admire the author's purpose in attempting to liberate women. Honestly, though, the illustrations are a terrible mishmash of illustrative techniques. At best they would be medical illustrations, but they are far too vague for that."
2,this ain't liberating or art...or even a coloring book.,"If this is your version of freedom, may I suggest a print of Georgia O'Keefe's ""Music, Pink and Blue"" instead?""Nobody sees a flower, really, it is so small. We haven't time - and to see takes time like to have a friend takes time.If I could paint the flower exactly as I see it no one would see what I see because I would paint it small like the flower is small. So I said to myself - I'll paint what I see - what the flower is to me but I'll paint it big and they will be surprised into taking time to look at it - I will make even busy New Yorkers take time to see what I see of flowers....Well, I made you take time to look at what I saw and when you took time to really notice my flower you hung all your own associations with flowers on my flower and you write about my flower as if I think and see what you think and see of the flower - and I don't.""- Georgia O'Keeffe"
2,Totally misses the mark,"The author's main premise can almost stand on it's own feet, given a helping hand from distraction. And the conclusion is fine... as long as one is prepared to make a leap of faith to make a skydiver blush. Other than that, however, you're about to buy yourself a rather expensive coffee coaster. Perhaps Richelieu was right after all..."
4,"Though demonstratably superior to similar books, lacks spark","There are indeed many things to be said vis a vis this book, which may indeed be effective at connoting the human condition. However, I must deduct one star for the offensive subtext, for such material is of, in fact, a prurient nature."
1,who knew a **** could be so boring?,Snatched this (pun intended) from my big brother's loft - BORING. I've even sniffed paint first and didn't find this funny or entertaining - OR stimulating.
5,Thank you for such a wonderful thing!,"This book is so wonderful.Nevermind the fact that i've been having a blast breaking out the crayons and coloring the beautifully drawn vaginas...But this book helps to de-mystify and remind women (or men) of the beauty of the female parts.This book contains about 25 drawings of flower-like genitalia. Each drawing is beutiful and unique - just in the same way that every woman is beautiful in a different way.This book presents women's sexuality is such a matter-of-fact and positive manner. I wish all women could see this book as a child, again as a teen, and again as an adult - to remember to always be proud and never be ashamed."
5,A piece of History - not to be missed,"This is a coloring book with full-page drawings of women's labia. Of course the artistry is suberb.The binding and paper are far superior to what you expect with the name 'coloring book'. I was very pleasantly surprised at the print quality.The author's comments will speak better to this book than I would -'In 1973 I set out to do drawings of women's genitals for use in sex education groups. I wanted the drawings to be lovely and informative, to give pleasure and affirmation. I organized the drawings into a coloring book because a major way we learn to understand the world, as children, is by coloring. As adults many of us still need to learn about our external sexual anatomy.' -Tee Corinne"
4,beautiful tribute to French chanson,"Barbara is a magnificent singer, but this particular album is especially satisfying because she is covering the works of Brel and Brassens. Her renditions are wonderful, and this album from 50 years ago makes for a good listen. Some are lighthearted and some are more austere, but all of them reflect on a terrific artist who is paying loving tribute to two amazing songwriters."
5,The most complete book on Golf Fundamentals,This book is the most amazing book on golf I have ever read. It is complete with photographs and analysis. The golf swing has never been presented in such a clear manner. The fundamentals listed are easy to understand and easy to follow. I am so ammazed that such a complete book on golf was written so long ago. I think this book can help golfers of all ages and handicaps. I loaned my copy to a friend and now I am trying to find another copy for my files. It is a must read!
3,"Okay, but not up to the Reader's Digest book","Deni Brown has made a gallant effort to spiff up the presentation of sewing techniques and technology with this book. However there are problems. Brown and her publisher tried using real-life color photos of various things. The problem is that thread is intentionally hard to see -- it's thin and a well-made garment is made such that the threads are not supposed to show. So the illustrations in Brown's book don't show very well the pinning and stitching. The descriptions are also not as stellar as the Reader's Digest book. Don't get me wrong -- Brown knows her stuff, and this is a nice companion to the Reader's Digest book. But for a single reference, if one does not want to own two on this subject, the Reader's Digest Complete Guide To Sewing is much the better book."
5,great learners book,This is a great book if want to learn some different techniques in sewing. I love this book because it is very easy to understand. It will have you sewing like a pro in no time. i give it a 5 stars for great illustrations and easy directions. This book covers most of your quesions about your future sewing projecs.
3,Get's The Job Done,"Imagine a vacuum bag designed to so tightly fit the space assigned to it that it cannot expand to maximum storage of debris and you have the T, which fits the small Eureka Rally 2 cleaner. An extra inch or two of usable space might have been nice."
4,Original product fits perfectly,Just a good old vacuum bag. I can't stand bag-less vacuums. When I go to empty them dust just gets everywhere including my sinuses!
4,it worked,"it worked as good as you can expect for its size. Stores around me quit carrying them so I have to buy them online. It's worth the money, if you don't have alot of pet hair."
2,"Misleading. Not a bracelet, just the charm.","I thought based on the description that it was a charm bracelet. Well, I thought wrong. It was just the charm."
5,Loved It,"A friend told me to listen to this album a ling time ago, since I have a wide range of musical taste, I thought why not... I loved every bit of it."
4,Great read from a great blog!,This is a great collection of writings from a thought-provoking website. A little bit of something for every fem reader.
5,Bitchiest fest ever!,Book came as promised and was full of the humor and thought-provoking philosophy I've come to enjoy from Bitch the Magazine!
1,somewhat clear presentation...inappropriate exercises,"The text itself is reasonably good...i.e. what's presented is clear. However, there are two major problems.1) The book goes for breadth and sacrifices depth. 2) Most of the exercises are inappropriate.For example, one little section studies cyclic groups briefly, but the meat of it is presented in the exercises, such as the exercises requiring you to prove Sylow's theorems. How can a reader who's barely grasped the material from a few scant pages tackle such a complicated assignment.this makes the book quite useless for self study, but it's kind of nice as a reference."
2,Not a good book for self study.,"I bought this book for self study. I would not recommend it for that purpose. My main problem was that there aren't any solutions to any of the problems. I am (and I think most people are) someone who learns math by doing math. I also need to know if I am making widely outrageous mistakes. I don't require every problem to have a solution, but I can't learn when I have no idea if I'm doing it right."
4,Le Serpent Rouge CD,This is a very quirky belly dance music album which has some interesting tracks on it. I don't personally like them all but some are great.
5,"If you love vampires, you will love this series","I don't have HBO and took a chance that this series would be my kind of show..and it is.. I'm addicted. Great story line, believable and all the gory stuff too. Enjoy.."
5,True Blood Season 1,"I jumped on the bandwagon and had to start watching this series, so I bought Season 1. Loved it! The price is a lot cheaper than the stores and the show is enticing from the first episode. Sookie, a mind-reading waitress at a Louisiana pub, meets Bill the vampire when he comes into the pub one night. Bill happens to possess the only mind she's not able to read, which only heightens Sookie's interest in him. Their attraction to each other catapults them into a ""mixed"" relationship that is met with disdain and apprehension by all of their friends and/or loved ones. As time goes on the viewer is introduced to various vampires and the ""rules"" and ""laws"" they live by. Highly recommend it."
3,I love a good vampire book.,I bought this first season because I loved the book so much. But the series does not really do the book any justice the story is not the same and characters are a lot different. But I will probably watch the rest of the other seasons.
2,"Poor condition, worse than told advertised","The discs are in pretty good condition I'm sure they will all work fine BUT the original case it came in is all beat to hell and is covered in this sticky, crusty stuff that looks like snot or syrup and in sharpie on the box and every disc is the girls name who previously owned them. I'm throwing out the terrible disgusting box, but I'm keeping the DVDs. Unfortunately now I have to buy them a different case."
5,Can't wait for series two to come out,The True Blood series is worth buy and sitting on the couch and watching. Loves each chapter. I am hooked !!!!!
3,Doesn't compare to book series,"I bought and devoured all the books about this story line (Sookie and Bon Temps Vampires) and was excited to see it come to life on the screen. So I purchased the dvd set because I don't have HBO. At first it was exciting seeing another's perspective on the story line. But as the story unfolded it began to stray further and further away from the beloved original story to the point were I found myself frustrated because it just got ridiculous. If you keep in mind that it will not be even close to the original story, it is a good series for tv entertainment value. However, I will not be buying the next series on DVD though because I found it was just not worth the money based on my expectations that it would at least do the original book series some basic justice. Disappointed...."
2,Very Disappointing,"I know that alot of people will disagree with me and that's fine. I will be honest and say that I did not make it through the entire first season. I just couldn't take any more. I have read all of Charlaine Harris's Sookie Stackhouse novels and they are fantastic. Now people say that I will compare it to the books and that's not true. I just don't think it's any good. My first complaint is that Sookie and the vampires (Bill and Eric) aren't good looking enough. Sorry if you don't agree. That's also true of the Twilight movies, too. Secondly, the writing is so bad! OMG! There is not one likeable character on the show! And what is up with Tara? Why is she such a jerk? If you love vampires, do yourself a favor and read the books and forget about this show. They don't do the books justice by any means."
4,Bridget's Review,"I know I'm behind the times. I just finished watching True Blood: The Complete First Season (HBO Series) on Saturday and it's a good show. Personally, I like Twilight and The Vampire Diaries better, but True Blood is fun way to spend a weekend."
3,TRUEBLOOD,I LOVE THE SERIES BUT MY DVDS CAME IN SCRATCHED UP. SOME OF THE DVDS STOPPED AND SKIPPED A BIT.
1,Do you like vampire porn?,"This is nothing but corny soft porn with a vampire sub plot. I was going to stop after one episode but I watched the first four and then I gave up. You can't go 5 minutes without a sex scene, or at least some mention of sex. It's really too much, and honestly it made me uncomfortable to watch it. The sexual aspect aside, it was very difficult for me to even get into the plot of the show. The actors are horrible and I found myself laughing at what is probably supposed to be serious. After 4 episodes I found that I had absolutely no interest in what was going to happen next."
1,If you enjoy the books skip the series.,"I truely enjoy the book series but sadly was enraged by the poor attempt to turn it to a tv series. From the cheese bad acting to the loose story lines its all bad. If you like day time soaps or dramas like Melrose then you would like this. If you enjoy sexy vampires, werewolves or even the Sookie attitude then definatly skip this butchering of a great story."
1,terrible show,"I am a big fan of all things vampire. But I hated this series.Sookie's goodie goodie all things are rosy and nice attitude grated on my nerves.Her motto ""Vampires are people to.""She comes off as a vampire groupie that can't see the danger in thier integration into mainstream society.HATED THIS SHOW !!!!!!!!Luckily I rented it from Blockbuster. Could only stomach the first 3 discs, after that I could not bear to watch it.Took it back early."
1,Not as good as the Books!!!,The books are way better....This is just an excuse to show nudity and use foul language on the big screen.I'm no prude but this sucks (excuse the pun!)My friend loan it to me to view and I did not care for it.Not worth the money....
1,Uh.....,"I love vampire shows, films, and books, and have copies of most all of them, however, this one I had to shut off. The show seems to be nothing but porn with a little story mixed in. Very dissapointed and will not watch again."
4,"""I wanna do bad things with you""","Since The Sopranos, Deadwood, Rome and Carnivale have left HBO, I was waiting for the next big thing from this once dominate original series network. To fill the void, I have been watching and remain hooked to Showtime's Dexter.Being a horror fan, I knew that this show would be right up my alley. I will admit that it took me longer than expected to get into the characters and the whole vampires being ""out of the coffin"" aspect. Since this is a show about vampires it thankfully doesn't shy away from the gore and nudity either. You will get more than your fill in almost every episode. Forget the watered down Twilight crap, this is how vampires are suppose to be.This is a show that will grow on you and I am now really looking forward to the second season. By the way, sorry Dexter, True Blood has the best opening credits ever and a song that fits it like a savage bite to the neck."
1,I didn't even make it through the first episode,"I like vampire movies. I don't particularly like the South.I don't know if this show was trying to become the Dixie version of Twilight and I'll never find out either. The first ten minutes or so were interesting. The concept was pretty novel and it seemed to be moving along nicely... then they got to the bar. Besides the crude language and topics of discussion, then the overly gratuitous nudity and sex, there was the female psychic that can hear EVERYONE'S thoughts and she has a savior complex.Oh I tried. I fought very hard to continue watching. I figured: I paid for it, I'm gonna watch it. Then the vampire shows up at her house. At that point I could no longer hold my intellect in check nor my desire for a meaningful plot. I made it to the 34 minute mark and I had to quit. I'm sure there is more to this show than the first 34 minutes of an episode, but I'll just have to learn of it some other way than $3 per episode."
1,Soft Core Porn,I watched only the first episode and that was enough. The main story lines were vampires are cool and I can't wait to have sex with one.
1,True Blood tv program,"The books were great and I have read every one of them, but the tv series is horrible and I would NOT recommend that anyone watch it. It bears almost no resemblance to the books."
1,A very bad series!,"I only watched two episodes, the movie is of poor quality, and full of very explicit sexual episodes. I would not watch anymore episodes."
2,True Blood,"I love the books and had high hopes for the show. The story lines they made up for supporting characters are awful. The whole drug angle with Jason is pathetic... They made Sookie into a self righteous piece of work, and Sam into a whiney dog boy... don't even get me started on Tara and her mother. I wish they would stick more to the vampire story line then focus so much on characters that are hardly in the books. Hopefully season 2 will be better and she can leave her goofy friends behind when she heads to Dallas."
2,"The Books are Better, but Eric is HOT.","I got HBO to watch 'True Blood' because I liked the books so much. I canceled my HBO subscription at the end of the season. I only kept it as long as I did because I could not get enough of Alexander Skarsgard, who plays Eric. ( He was also fantastic in 'Generation Kill'. ) He and Pam are what got the 2 stars.The personalities of most of the characters are changed from the books, and mostly not for the better. Sookie, the main character of the books, has been warped into a bi-polar nightmare by the writers and mostly over-acted by Paquin. Important parts of the vampire mythology from the books have been left out and instead we get the ""V"" story line and the illogical ""tribunal"". Some great moments from the books are in the show but without the ""glue"" that tied them together the story often seems schizophrenic."
2,"entertaining in a way, yet a big disappointment to those who've read the books","It is an entertaining tv series,( that's why I gave it a 2 instead of 1) yet, if you have read the books and expect it to be as good as the books, you'll be disappointed.1) it is nothing like the book, the books are so much better, i)jason is not an idiotic man ho like it's portrayed in the tv series. ii)the subplot of tara and her mom is not in the book. iii) in the book, vampire blood is not treated as a drug in the book, it doesn't give you stupid, over-the-top erection for one thing.2) Anna paquin is extremely annoying, she over-acts everything, and whats wrong with her accent? I have no idea why she won the Golden Gobe. I love her performance in 'the piano'. but in true blood, it's simple hard to watch.3) I love sexy and steamy sex scenes so don't get me wrong. But there's just too much of it, to a point where I find it unnessecary and silly"
5,"Great show, great price","True Blood is an exciting and creative show based on the Sookie Stackhouse novels. I am usually disappointed by movies/shows that are based on books because they can be so abbreviated due to time constraints. However, True Blood- season one is twelve hours dedicated to the first book in the Sookie Stackhouse series. Not only is it thorough, but it has it's own creative twists and turns so that it is not exactly like the book. In this series, you learn alot about the supporting characters as well. This is really a great show."
3,horror,"strange southern Mississipi environment;very violent construction of the whole plot.Exacerbated sex scenes.one do not fully understand what the screen player wants to deliver as a message,if any,to the audience.Yet it is intriguing and worth being seen."
2,"5 stars for show, 0 stars for poor dvd quality!","True Blood is one of my favorite shows, but disc 3 does not play at all, and the rest of the discs play only occasionally. Fantastic show, crap dvd manufacturing!!"
3,technical difficulties,"Great series, but this is the third time I've purchased a TV series on DVD where one of the discs wouldn't play. In this set, the first two played just fine; the third on just ejected itself. As far as I can tell, there's not a mark or scratch on it. Wish I could count on the quality. So annoying to have to send them back. I guess I'll just rent digitally from now on. And I don't dare purchase another as a gift--it would be so awkward and disappointing if the recipient couldn't enjoy the series."
4,I love this show!,"I love this show. No i don't have the dvd. I don't believe in buying tv shows that i can easily watch on HBO on Demand but this show is incredible. Everyone wants to make money off the success of vampire movies like Twilight. This show does it the right way. Yes, It has vampires but it's alot more than that. This show creates an entire new world. A world in which Vampires are no longer in hiding. A world that also includes many other mystical creatures. This show has it all and will hopefully be around for a very long time."
2,Soft Porn + Thin Plot + OK acting + Vivid Colors,"I rented the first disc of Season 1.The scenes look vivid with colors.The acting is not bad.All other things about this show are not good. For example, like many other viewers said, it's like a soft porn. The plot is very thin. I get bored after finishing disc 1. I did not rent the remaining ones."
2,"Points for effort, but it's no icronical.com","I just cannot get into this show. I've seen the entire first season and the first episode of the second season and I've given up. Whether or not the show is purposely trying to come off as poorly written and poorly acted is irrelevant. It is poorly written and it is poorly acted. If that's the point, then we shouldn't be watching it in the first place. Alan Ball is talented no doubt, but he's not on point here. He's lucky that so many people are obsessed with vampires at the moment - Six Feet Under was a solid production, solid like [....], but True Blood? Nah."
4,"Good, but the books are better","It's a decent show, on it's own I would say it's great. But being as I am a huge fan of the book series, the deviations from the book can irk me at time."
2,Not like the books!,"I have read the entire series of books to date and the show follows to some extent, but not all that closely and I was disappointed that it was all about the sex. I enjoyed the books and while they were steamy and passionate at some pints there seems to be alot more of that in the show and it wasn't at all what I was expecting. If I take it as a separate entity from the books it is alright, still not something I would sit down and watch with any regularity."
4,Highly addictive vamp series,This is a highly addicitive TV series set in the Deep South and all about those wicked vamps. I was surprised by how raunchy the content is--pretty much every episode features some full frontal sex scenes so not appropriate for the little ones! The pace never slackens and you really get drawn into the world of Bon Temps.
3,OK series,I was unfamilar with the series until seeing the DVD. First couple of shows were fair and I was wondering why people were so impressed with the series. Last couple of shows improved so I now understand why it has a following.
5,Vampires Are The New Gays,"Finally a Vampire story-line that gives a fresh and imaginative take on the genre! The Vampires are 'out' in the open and walk among us mortals, demanding civil rights and a place in the world. No longer in need of drinking our blood to survive they are trying to change their bloody image. The show is innovative in the way it mimics the plight of black people and the gay community's struggle for acceptance through time. It is witty and sarcastic, fearlessly showing how minorities of any kind are shunned because of their differences.This show redeemed television for me after almost giving up on shows that nowadays seem to all be focused on remakes from the 90s. Like i said FINALLY some innovative television.Watch it, you will be completely hooked."
5,great series!,"If you love vampire stories, this is a must see. Varies from the books though. I am hooked and awaiting each new episode weekly."
3,Okay,Sometimes corny but i still likeyou I live the bill suki scenes. Didnt like voodoo stuff. That was stupid. I guess i like the blood sucking romance of vampires.
4,Based On Charlaine Harris' Books???,"Although I really do enjoy the TV series, (Who wouldn't enjoy watching all the eye candy brought together for our enjoyment???) I do think that it should read 'loosely based' for the first year, and 'VERY loosely based' for the second year. I do recommend the series; I even more highly recommend the books! Charlaine Harris is the author, and Sookie Stackhouse is the series."
4,Scary but Interesting,"The plot is weird, but intriguing. I wish I had known how scary it would be before buying it! If you don't like seeing large quantities of blood, this show may not be for you. There are also corny ""Twilight"" moments, but most of the romantic parts are not that over the top. There are lots of sex scenes as well, but most are relevant to the plot. Overall, True Blood is a show that keeps you entertained."
5,True Blood Season 1,Love the show! I have read all the books and really enjoy watching it happen. I love the people chosen to star in it too. They fit a;most perfectly!!
5,Satisfied Customer,The condition of the case was great! All Dvds were it good as new as well. I love true blood! It really is a must watch.
3,Not as good as I had anticipated = 2.5 stars,"Coming from the creator of one of the most enjoyable TV shows (Six Feet Under), I had high expectations for this show. Perhaps unrealistically high.This show that is basically set inside a secluded bar while critiquing the relationships within a small town seems remarkably similar to a certain show created by David Lynch. However, it doesn't possess any of the suspense or darkness that Twin Peaks had.If I had to summarize my experience of the 1st season without spoilers I would say this:1. Enough with the forced Southern accents. They are inaccurate and grating.2. Too easy to see the comparisons between gay rights and vampire rights. I expect more subtlety for HBO productions.3. Plot seems to rotate between sex and sucking blood. Could have benefitted from more suspense and mystery.That said, I'll begrudgingly watch Season 2 to see if it improves."
4,not for the easily offended,"I enjoyed the movie set. It was a great value for the money. Just be careful as the show is not for everyone. The language is really bad and is really sexual in nature, so it is not for those offended by these things or for the young."
1,SHOULD HAVE STUCK TO THE BOOKS,"The story line gets so far away from the books it was made after and it's unfortunate because the books really are much better.Because the series strayed so far from the books it seems like a LOT was left out of the main plot of the book and led to really poor character development and plot development.I thought the actors were so unbelievable for the characters they were portraying, it's hard to root for them, and I don't know if it's the actor's or director's fault but the scenes are so cheesy, sometimes it's just plain painful to watch."
2,sirannon2,"HBO took the low road.I am on book four of the Sookie Stackhouse series. I hadn't seen the series and bought season one to get a visual on the characters. For the most part I liked Sookie, Bill and Sam. I knew it was HBO with vampires and I clearly wasn't expecting ""Father Knows Best"". My complaint is the far too excessive profanity and the bad taste softporn.What could have been an excellent opportunity to build on Charlane Harris' books just once again showed Hollywood's poor judgment. By episode three or four I was fastforwarding through scenes. Toward the end of the series it was being somewhat toned down compared to the beginning. Disappointed with the writing not Anna Paquin, Stephen Moyer and Sam Trammell,"
2,Trueblood OK if you like unleavened creepiness,"Since I don't get HBO, I awaited the first season of Trueblood on DVD with excitement. It's a disappointment. The adapters chose to emphasize the creepiness and sex. Not that those are necessarily bad, but one can take in only so much explicit humpin' and pumpin' sex without some foil for it. What's missing in the adaptation is a sense of humor. With the exception of LaFayette, no one in the cast is allowed to crack so much as a wry smile.Publisher's Weekly calls the WRITTEN series ""humorous southern-fried fantasy with biting satirical commentary."" The TV version has lost the humor and takes a very heavy hand with social commentary.Go read Charlaine Harris's books instead."
2,too much nudity,This would definitly qualify for a NC17 rating. It was too graphic for my taste and I will not be continuing with the series. Now I just have to get rid of this one.
4,Characters you will never forget,"All of the HBO series are worth the subscription or the DVD set. Being a fan of the creative process, I am blown away by the excellent work of the entire cast and crew who put this show together. As with all of HBO's series, this production company never misses one detail to create the eerie effect they were going for. All of the actors in the lead roles are phenomenol and bring these characters to life until you feel like you know them. Great theatre. The show is a little too violent for me but the acting is intense and riveting and the cinematography is amazing as always."
4,True Blood ... a Great series.,True blood is a great series. Purchasing the season set gave us a chance to see all the episodes we missed.
5,great fun,"Campy, trashy vampire fun. Great cast, best looking group of vampires in recent memory. If you're looking for something profound, don't waste your time. If you're looking for a well filmed & creatively written vampire soap opera, you will be enetertained. Not holds barred eroticism/homoeroticism. Great fluff/escape material. Enjoy."
5,TrueBlood,"Since I do not subscribe to HBO I had heard of this production so ordered the set for viewing. First the packaging is excellent then the program itself is well written, superbly acted and quite entertaining. Let me know when the next season is available"
5,trueblood,this is hands down a great show!! simply my favorite. i recommend it to anyone old enough to watch it!
5,Great show,True Blood is one of the best shows on cable TV. Its definatley a rated R program I had to have it for my collection. You would be hooked on it in no time. Season two is even better !!! Cant wait for that to come out on DVD.
5,Very Fast,"Just as described, and the fastest shipping ever. I ordered season 2 from Best Buy the same day, this beat theirs by two days. A+++++"
4,I am in it for the action,"ok, looks like i came in a bit too late on this. i liked the show. I am currently on season 2 and it is MUCH better then season 1 but i enjoyed it non the less.i haven't read the books and from the sounds of thing s i might not like the show that much if i had.i like the show....it you are teetering on the edge of buy/don't buy....i think you should buy the first season so you can understand what is happening in the second season which is better.enjoy"
5,loved it from the first time i watched it!!!,ive always been a fan of vampires since i can remember..i have to say i really enjoyed the first season of true blood. cant wait to start season 2..it has alot of action and suspense. theres just the right amount of passion/sexually tension and thats great!! LOVE IT!!!
3,Quite different,"I really enjoyed Sookie books but the story traslated to the TrueBlood series is not quite as entretaining. Lot of sex involved and not so much attached to the book story line. Lots of things that I thought where important on the book where erased or modified in the series. Well, in this series you might actually fell in love with Bill, which by the way, he is exactly as I imagined physically. There are also lot of side stories that leaves the main character away from the plot, in the series Sookie is a bit annoying compared to the one on the book. The only scene I really liked how it was changed was Sookies grandma funeral, much more real than in the book. Anyway, its worth seeing this series if you really like fiction."
4,Great show,Excellent show. There were many additions that were not in the book and some were not necessary. I guess for a TV show they needed to embellish but I found Tara distracting and did not like the change in Sookie's brother but on the whole I loved every episode.
5,True Blood - The Complete First Season,"This is a very entertaining look at today's society. Just substitute the word ""gay"" for vampire. Or substitute ecstasy (E) for the drug of choice in the series for ""V"".Hopefully this will make some people examine their own prejudices."
2,Sadly Disappointed,"I have to say that I LOVE the book series and have read all of the ones written so far. I cannot believe how awful the HBO series based on the books is. I was so excited about the TV series based on the books but, I am sad to say I was so disappointed. They took a great book series and turned it into a smutty, foul-mouthed TV show. They have characters in the show that I do not even recall being in the books. I usually never write reviews for things but, I felt I just had to leave one on this series. The books are so good and I cannot believe that Charlaine Harris would want her books portrayed in this manner. I guess she is not bothered by it. I wish that I could get my money back on the DVD's. I will continue to read her books because she is such a good author but, I will just use my imagination and not watch the series. My imagination is better."
5,True Blood,"This is one super series. I have always been a fan of Vampire movies, but this one takes the cake. Great acting and super soundtrack keep you running till the very end. Now for season two"
4,TrueBlood fun,"I had read all the books, but since I don't have HBO, hadn't seen the series. I watched it all in 2 evenings and loved it. Not strictly faithful to the books, but great if you allow for some artistic changes. Anna Paquin is perfect as Sookie and the men are sexy. Shows much of the humor seen in the books. I may have to get HBO for this year and have already pre-ordered the 2nd season."
5,Riveting!,"I adored this series from the first episode. It is quirky, sexy, dark, deep, haunting. If you have any interest in vampires, this is the ultimate. It has the magic ""Alan Ball"" touch and pulls you right in to his world. This is the best HBO has offered in a long time. Prepare to be bitten,..."
3,Ok but not as good as books,"Although different from the books, I enjoyed watching the series. I only gave it three stars because there was way too much time spent on Tara's mother and Sookie's brother."
3,true blood,Sorry to say I began to watch this movie and had to pause it. I forgot about it and never saw the remainder of the film. To me it was a little graphic but I didn't view the whole movie so I can't really criticized it.
1,Do not buy from this seller,"I ordered what was supposed to be a new copy of a tv series on dvd. However, the box was damaged and all 5 discs had scratches on them. The scratches did not allow us to watch the movie. I got my product very promptly, but didn't know about this issue for 2 months because it was a Christmas present. I would not recommend buying from this seller. If you want to take the chance on getting something that is fake but still usable, go for it. But I personally wouldn't use this seller again."
2,no HBO standard,"This is the first time, that I'm disapointed about an HBO series. I liked The Sopranos, Deadwood and Band Of Brothers. All ""grownup"" shows and kind of revolutionary for the TV audience. I had high expectations in True Blood, but the result was a boring soap opera, disguised in a vampire story and filled with a lot of sex scenes, wich are mostly unnecessary. The show has interesting moments, but you've seen most of it on your ordinary TV-Show at every other channel.Too bad..."
1,Sex sells,"Seeing all the good reviews for this show proves the point that sex sells. After all, that's all this show is really about. There isn't really a plot and the characters are too over the top to form any real connection with. What a great way to ruin a really interesting premise: vampires out in the open! All that's left to say is.........could have..........should have..................."
1,"Books are great, show terrible!","This show was really terrible. If you like the books don't waste your time. I was really looking forward to seeing this (I have all of the books) and I am so glad I rented it at our Blockbuster instead of buying it. I watched several episodes to be sure it was bad because I really wanted to like it. (discs 2,3 and 5). Lots and Lots (way too much) sex and Nudity. It's basically the whole story with this t.v. show."
3,Fangly Disappointed,"After falling in love with the Sookie Stackhouse book series, I was anxious to see what the True Blood HBO Series was like and how it compared to the books. Am I ever sadly disappointed! The characters are nothing like a reader would imagine. Eric is the worst as he looks nothing like described in the book. And if you aren't into PORN than you might not want to watch this series as nearly every episode has nudity and strong sex scenes. Do not watch with your kids awake! The show is still interesting and entertaining but nothing like what i would have expected. I was told the show was more kinky and gory than the the books, that doesn't even describe it."
2,Just okay,"First, if you love the book series - you will be dissappointed. However, as a series I thought this was good, because I like the genre, but it took me a bit to get past how it fails the books it is based on.I had no problem with the series developing minor characters - they're interesting, one of Ms. Harris' talents. However, the series couldnt seem to stop themselves from layering certain characters to an almost ridiculous level. LaFayette is flamboyant and naughty, perfect as a regular in the series. However, producers kept the flamboyant, gay cook, but also made him a drug dealer and part-time prostitute. Same thing with ego-centric Jason Stackhouse. However, this character is personally disgusting. Instead of seeing how he can be repulsive in his attitude - he lives in squalor and general behavior leaves little to sympathize with.I think they could have done better."
3,=(,"Being a huge fan of the book, i jumped out of my seat hearing that a series was coming out. Sad enough i was all but excited when i started to watch. It doesnt follow much of the story which is a let down, and the whole thing going on with tara, no one cares she wasnt important in the book dont make her important now -_-, and! the whole idea of her and sam bs, sam was sookies knight NOT Taras. the sex scenes where over the top, but i guess thats an HBO series for you. But anyways, i gave it 3 stars for some parts where really good and kept me at my toes but then a sex scene whould ruin it so dont take my word for it watch or dont."
3,Will not always play,"Its not copy protected! For some reason it plays in the DVD player when ""it"" wants. other than that and the soundtrack claims ""may be different from television series"" I love True Blood! I would pay the extra money just to use a premium channel to watch it as it airs!"
2,not worth the bother,"i am very disappointed in HBO in coming out with a series about vampires. from the preview that i watched on amazon.com, i honestly wouldn't waste my money and time with this series."
5,OMG 2 fangs up!,"This is one of my top shows EVER!!!!!!!! I love love love this show! It has got drama, comedy, blood, gore, sex, and fangs. YOU will enjoy if you're a L. K. Hamilton book reader, or just plain fan of vampire, and supernatural stories. I don't know how close depiction of this show is to Ms. Harris' novels, which it is based out of, but goodness! This show is truly, truly amazing!"
5,MUST SEE!,"This is one of the best shows on t.v.! It's imaginative and very addicting. I love ERIC! I've read all 9 books and can't wait to see every season! Of course Eric doesn't really come in until season 2 but you gotta watch season 1 to catch up! Or read the books by Charlaine Harris, they are addicting and you will totally fall in love with the characters!"
3,Just ok; it's no Twilight,"Maybe it's just the first season, I heard a lot of good things about this and I'm a huge Twilight fan so I thought, hey what the heck. Well, it was ok, definitely no Twilight. Actually the plot was eerily familiar to the afore mentioned series but much more X-rated...can't say I'd advise this for the 18 and under crowd."
5,"Sorry, have to say it: ""bloody"" good show!!","The local paper/magazine reviews for this show weren't great, so I wasn't expecting a lot, but I got hooked in the first 10 minutes. Very enjoyable show, well written and acted. I was impressed with the way they brought the story full-circle and ended the first season in a satisfying way, yet left a number of open storylines for the next season (I think that's got to be a lot harder to do than it sounds). Yes, there is a lot of sex and nudity and a certain amount of violence, but that's to be expected on HBO. I went back and watched some of the episodes from the On Demand feature more than once. I plan to get the DVD when it comes out. One of the (IMO misguided) reviewers said the only thing he liked about the show was the title sequence, which I agree is great, but give the show a chance even if you're not sure, or you don't like vampires, or whatever. It just may grow on you."
5,Cant wait!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This show is not a guilty pleasure, I watch this show and proudly shout on the highest mountain yes!!!and it is good!!! LOL all jokes aside I LOVE THIS SHOW. All must watch, all must buy. Haters fall back."
4,"Good show, like the non-goth vampire feel","I am not one for ridiculous essays on products since I am not getting paid (you know who you are)to write an honest review of something I own and have watched. The series is great, good storyline thus far. I like the southern creole vampire feel, kinda Ann Rice, but less gothic and more contemporary. Wish HBO would have longer seasons than 12 episodes and kinda silly that there is only 2 episodes per disc on the blue ray. Never was a fan of HBOs DVD formatting anyway. The quality is good for BD, but there is some digital noise and artifacts you won't get on say the Dark Knight blue ray"
2,True Blood: The Complete First Season,I was not happy with the Dvd. Each Dvd of the series had one or two shows that would not play. I wrote Amazon regarding this and ask for them to return my money and I would return their Dvd series. I am still waiting for them to respond concerning this.
3,Once you watch Trueblood you can't stop!!!,Once you start watching Trueblood it becomes like an addiction. I truly loved this product that I bought through Amazon. It was awesome!!!
3,starting to fizzle.......,"the series started off pretty compelling the first few episodes. however, this one started to annoy me. i mean come-on....sookie seems to show practically no reaction to her gradma's murdered corpse. you could say she is frozen in shock but then later that night she has the composure to clean up the blood ""because her grandma wouldn't want the house to look like this""? this seemed way to far fetched to be believable. i don't care if you can read minds or not anyone seeing their closest family members murdered body in front of them would loose their sh%$. Aside from that Sam started to annoy me the way he was so needy... some of the dialog started to get a little try hard (the writers grasping a little) and boring. Anyway, generally a fun show. This episode did not make me compelled to jump up and watch the next one the way the previous episodes did. Oh, well I'm sure it will probably get better."
5,"I LOVE AMAZON.COM AND ""TRUE BLOOD""","AT CHRISTMAS YOU COULD NOT FIND TRUE BLOOD VIDEOS ANYWHERE, IN THE DEPARTMENT STORES. I NEVER GAVE THE INTERNET A THOUGHT. THEN ONE NIGHT AFTER MY BESTFRIEND HAD PURCHASED SEASON ONE {FOR $39.95 + 6% TAX} FOR ME FOR CHRISTMAS, I FOUND IT ON AMAZON.COM, FOR $16.99 BRAND NEW. THAT'S WHEN I DECIDED I'D BUY TWO OF THEM FOR BOTH OF MY GIRLS. WE ARE TIGHT AND SERIOUSLY INTO ""TRUE BLOOD""! SINCE THEN I HAVE PRE-ORDERED SEASON TWO, AND CAN NOT WAIT UNTILL IT SHIPS. I JUST WISH I KNEW WHEN THAT WILL BE. I WILL BE BUYING ALL MY DVD AND BLU-RAYS FROM AMAZON.COM FROM NOW ON."
5,Went great!,The set came within the delivery period. Was an authentic set and it cost less than the actual Amazon price. Way to go.
5,Fangtastic...The beginning!!,"You will become hooked after the first episode! As a Trubie... I have nothing but good things to say about this series. Excellent story line, sexy characters and every episode leaves you on the edge of your seat. Great Entertainment!!"
2,Disc's were melted,On disc 1 and 2 I could only watch the first episode on each bc there were spots on the disc that looked like it was melted
5,season 1 and 2 worth watching,"I enjoyed this season, its what got me addicted to the show, and I ordered season 2 quickly after. if you like myth and fantasy you will probably like this."
4,I loved it but....,I loved it but one of my disks ended up skipping just a tad. It was great besides that.I love the series and I would recommend it but it has mature content.
5,True Blood: I don't wanna know,"This was a great episode of True Blood, the video was outstanding on sound and visual quality. I would recommend the use of Amazon's digital video. I have a supernatural series and one episode of True Blood and I can watch it anywhere from any device I can access internet on."
4,Good Episode - Recommended,"This is the 9th episode in the HBO adaptation of the popular Sookie Stackhouse vampire novels (the first episode is Strange Love, see my review there for the content description).The title of this episode translates as ""The Joys of Love"", which of course is ironic, in hindsight. Bill made a natural choice (to us) that he now has to answer for to the other vamps, which places Sam in an awkward position. Tara is so impressed with her mother's recovery that she considers getting some supernatural help herself. Meanwhile, Amy and Jason tap a fresh source of ""V"".There are more special effects being used, mostly when Jason and Amy are using ""V"", and I'm not sure that it is adding to the overall story.This series is not for everyone and definitely not for younger viewers!CFH"
4,7th True Blood Episode - Back On Track,"This is the 7th episode in the HBO adaptation of the popular Sookie Stackhouse vampire novels (the first episode isStrange Love, see my review there for the content description).While I didn't like the previous episode, ""Cold Ground"", this one was much more enjoyable. Tara and her mother take a trip way off the beaten path (both literally and figuratively) to cast out that troublesome demon. In an awkward series of events, Jason heads out to the vamp bar in search of ""V"" and meets a new character (Amy).This was one of the more creative chapters in the series.This series is not for everyone and definitely not for younger viewers!CFH"
4,DVD,The DVDs arrived before expected. Overall they were in good condition but there were a few spots on the DVDs where they froze or skipped. Overall good purchase!
4,Good series about vampires mysteries.,"Amazin Blu ray, that tell us the history of vamparies in another way, like them living around us. And make we think about it.I would like more titles of HBO series that have more subtitlles in Portuguese, i'm a Brazilian, and here in Brazil we like very mutch the HBO series.Thank."
4,Awesome!,"Love True Blood! The hype definitely lived up! The only caveat is 5 discs. I thought blu-ray was supposed to hold more data? Other than that, LOVE the show!"
5,True Blood The Complete First Season,It was an addicting season; so many turns and twist in the plot from episode to episode. Loved the program... Can't wait to get started on the second season...
1,TRASH,Sorry I obtained this for my granddaughter. My husband watched a few minutes of it and said it was trash...explicit sex and horrible language. I'm sorry Charlaine has let her books go this route...she seems like a grounded lady. Not for the clean minded person....and to think they won't put a rating on this...just trying to get all the $$$ they can. VERY DISAPPOINTED
1,the DVDS don't work:(,"I was excited to get a bargain on TRUE BlOOD season one[A Great show].After viewing the first of 5 discs once, I went to replay disc 1 and it wouldn't play[On any of our 3 players].None of the other 4 discs would play either. The vender's return policy is 30 days on unopened products.It isn't worth my time to go to a big hassle to recover my 20 something $'s. I probably won't buy DVD's from amazon again."
1,"Trash, trash, trash","I purchased this series because I had read all of the books and LOVED them. The attraction with the books were that they were all well written and did not have a lot of explicit sex scenes. This series more than makes up for the lack in the books! If they could have followed the basic story as written, it would have been much better. As it is, unless you have a voyeuristic personality, this series is NOT for you."
1,Just Awful,"This show s terrible.I like campy stuff and I like vampires, but this show is junk. The acting is beyond terrible, the writing is pure trash, the dialogue is stilted, and what little plot there is is unbelievably stupid.Add to that some of the worst fake southern accents I've ever heard, and you have a steaming pile of bat guano.I really wanted to like this, but it's just not any good."
1,TRUE BLOOD SEASON I,"True Blood spends too much time in nudity and the obscene and not enough time developing a story. The death scences of a Vampires are gross when they turn into a mess of blood. The characters are hard to believe and act like idots most of the time. The love Sookie Stackhouse is supposed to feel for Bill the Vampire is lacking,you don't feel the magic between them. Their facial expressions don't even show a deeping love. The secondary characters are a drag on the show i.e., sheriff etc, very poor activng or directing, whichever. Emotion is entirely missing in the acting for the entire cast. It is definitely not one that I would considering purchasing or rewatching beyond the HBO initial series. Give it One * Star. After seeing Moonlight, True Blood is a belly flop, At least HBO didn't dump the audience that enjoys this show like CBS did Moonlight or Lifetime did Blood Ties."
1,Yuck! Spare yourself this travesty...,"I loved these books. I read a lot of horror so I'm not a prude...But oh my god what they did to this series!!Honestly the majority of these episodes are disgusting. You can sort of see the characters & plot through all the spurting blood, deliberate shocking images and juxtapositions designed to jolt the most jaded, oh and extreme quantities of extraneous s & m porn sex scenes.Wouldn't recommend this to my worst enemy."
1,Not the Sookie Stackhouse Series...Alan has made his own world,"So I am disappointed....why may you ask? Well I love Harris's characters in her Sookie Stackhouse series and this just isn't it. Alan Ball and his screen writers have changed all the character events and their respective images. Most and almost all of the event in the TV series don't even happen in the books. I sat there and while watching this tv series saying things like ""that's not what happened...Tara isn't like that in the book..Sam and Tara nope never happened...who the hell is that..?"" It's like they stole the basic plot line (very basic) and the characters names and decided to throw out Harris's story. NOT HAPPY! The story was soo good the way it was. As a fan of the books...the TV series has not matched up at all to the books and the books are WAY BETTER than the series... On another note Paquin doesn't get Sookie right, but that might not be all her fault since the writers have flipped the story upside down."
1,Anna Paquin Ruins An Already Horrible Adaptation,"I could forgive the HBO series story-line for deviating from the book series, but Anna Paquin's horrible acting ruins the series entirely. She couldn't act when she was in X-Men and she apparently hasn't taken any lessons between then and now. With a new lead actress, the series would be at least less horrible than it is... except for the fact that the HBO series is nothing but soft-core porn aimed to disrespect and sexualize women - something that Charlaine Harris most certainly would not do."
1,Trash,"These shows are complete TRASH! I have enjoyed reading all the Sookie Stackhouse novels, so I got the entire first season thinking I would really enjoy it. I was disgusted with what I was given. Sorry, people...from start to, I'm guessing, finish these are completely revolting. I didn't make it past episode 4...I was too sick to my stomach."
4,"""I wanna do bad things with you""","Since The Sopranos, Deadwood, Rome and Carnivale have left HBO, I was waiting for the next big thing from this once dominate original series network. To fill the void, I have been watching and remain hooked to Showtime's Dexter.Being a horror fan, I knew that this show would be right up my alley. I will admit that it took me longer than expected to get into the characters and the whole vampires being ""out of the coffin"" aspect. Since this is a show about vampires it thankfully doesn't shy away from the gore and nudity either. You will get more than your fill in almost every episode. Forget the watered down Twilight crap, this is how vampires are suppose to be.True Blood is a show that will grow on you and I am now really looking forward to the second season. By the way, sorry Dexter, True Blood has the best opening credits ever and a song that fits it like a savage bite to the neck."
2,"It's okay, but...","It's okay but, it's not very good. It's just okay, I watched the whole season in one sitting cause I felt that I needed to finish it. Paid almost $40 for the set.If you like okay B movies than you'll like this series. I can't say that I didn't like it, but it's something I wished that I had rented first before buying.Quite a few of the characters are very easy to guess, you'll see when you watch it. I figured the whole plot and characters within the first two episodes. Which just made the other ten a bit forced to watch, cause once again, cause I bought the whole season.Enjoy."
1,An insult to Charlaine Harris' Series,"I expected to like this series since I really like the books. To say that the TV series is ""loosely based"" on the books is an understatement. The only things they have in common are the names of the characters and the fact that Sookie can read minds and that Bill is a vampire. Really a disappointment!"
2,very graphic,I loved the books. I was stunned at how the HBO show is so sexually graphic. I went back and checked the books and there is some sex but that isn't the focus of the story. There is so much more sex in the show. It is unnecessary for the story. I wish the story line was followed more closely.
3,Oops!,Had to purchase because I returned a dvd player with episode 3 still in dvd player. I don't watch this */?%. But I'm glad amazon carried this title.
5,Great Show for Adult Fans of The Twilight Saga!,"This is a great show for the adult fans of Twilight! The action, adventure, and fun is a great way to sit back and relax! The books are great too!!!!"
4,TrueBlood Doesn't Disappoint,"TrueBlood Season 1 was a great ride. It stuck close to the Southern Vampire Mystery Series by Charlaine Harris, with a little bit of Hollywood stuck in there. The settings were great; the homes seemed very realistic as well as the people."
2,"Sleaze Central, poor Sookie","I gave this two stars for the intro song and credits. Great little mini-movie. I really like the books, but this HBO version just changes everything to sleazy, gross, nasty. No likable characters, way too much sex, too little internal consistency in the characters, not much genuine humor. Sookie is almost repugnant, a complete ditz. In the books, she's a very interesting heroine. And why so much time for a character not even in the books, Tara? She's OK, but far too one-dimensional (ie: angry) to carry half the show. Very disappointed."
2,Waste of Money,I was excited when the box set I ordered off line came in. Then I started watching and I was disappointed. I kept waiting for it to get better. But episode after episode was disappointing. It was so fake and stupid and boring. I mean some of the story lines were okay but it wasn't realistic. The best thing was i could resale on Amazon at least i thought so. I tried to post on my seller account and they said they are no longer allowing season 1 to be sold here..wtf..now I am out of $17..what a waste of money..I really enjoy the vampire diaries..its wholesome and good. True Blood is soft porn with a lot of unnecessary cursing.
4,Fun series,"It's like ""Dark Shadows,"" but with actual sex and story lines that go somewhere. The premise of an ""out"" vampire culture is explored well, as are several other supernatural themes. Other than a couple of characters (particularly Lafayette) I didn't think the acting was all that great, but that never prevented me for enjoying the series. If you're into vampire stories, this is definitely one you gotta check out. (Axton)"
4,True Blood: The Complete First Season (HBO Series),"I like the show, it just doesn't follow the books the way I thought it would. A lot of changes with Characters, but overall, I'm glad I bought it! :)"
3,Major Disappointment,"You know how most people will comment on a movie, saying it's not as good as the book? This is really true of True Blood. There were so many changes from the book (yea, yea, I know, they have to ""adapt"" for the small screen) that I found some of the characters unrecognizable. All the sex and nudity didn't bother me, except that it seemed they threw it in as often as possible so I found it tedious and would fast forward to get back to the story. The books (especially the earliest ones) glossed over the sex, leaving it to the readers imagination. You definitely don't need an imagination with HBO's version. I don't hate the series, just got tired of it pretty quickly. Guess I'll stick to the books, though even there Harris is beginning to lose momentum and is adding more and more bizarre story lines. My recommendation - read the books. They're fun for the most part."
4,True enough,"It took me a few episodes to get into this show. At first I found the sex and violence a bit graphic, but probably 4 episodes in I got into the storyline and forgot any concerns that I had. I knew I was hooked when I found myself saying 'I can watch another episode, it's only 4 a.m.'This show has a great campy, horror show-esque feel to it that's so different from other things on TV. At first I found Sookie to be very annoying, but she grew on me and as the series progressed I found her less and less irratating.The best thing about the show (other than the gorgeous cast) is the way that completely out of this world things are handled on a very down-to-earth manner. Is it completely unbelievable at times? Yes, but it's such a great way to escape your everyday problems.If you're on the fence about True Blood, I say give it a try...and don't give up after the first few episodes. It's worth it!"
2,oh dear....,"After finally getting around to reading the books I finally decided to see the television show and oh dear...it was not what I expected. I get that sometimes the books varry from the television shows; however, I found the show very annoying and boring. I found Sookie's character to be annoying and I am attributing that to the accent and her whiney big girl attitude. Bill's character seemed overly stiff. Jason was just having sex with just about anything with a pulse and doing it at various speeds might I add. The only character I liked and the only reason I don't completely hate it is due to Eric's character."
5,true blood is terrific,"As per usual excellent HBO standards, this series just simply rocks! Good acting, well written, sex all over the screen, interesting characters, beautifully photographed. Loved it. Cannot wait for ongoing episodes."
5,One of the few television shows I watched.,"Before it kind of went off into WTF? land True Blood ran itself close to the first book and was a truly engaging, TV show with a plan. Sure there were subplots and weird things exploding all over Bon Temps but it wasn't as insane at the fifth season. Season One solidified my dislike for the schizophrenic Sookie Stackhouse, loathe the way Bill pronounces Sookie's name, fangirl Eric and his total epicness, get a girl crush on Pam and envy Lafayette's style. Jason, has dumb as that boy is it's not a grating stupidity. He's wholly endearing is his moronism and you can't help but like him. There are so many more that are thoroughly intriguing that would have me rambling forever on their awesomeness. This was the beginning and it certainly hasn't ended for me yet."
3,Not too impressed,"I was hoping for more, but I'd still give more episodes a try, but only if they were free unfortunately."
5,GREAT! To watch over and over again.,True Blood is an excellent overview of the Sookie Stackhouse books. It is addicting! I cant wait until season 2 comes out
4,Interesting Premise.,"At first glance the acting and story line are quirky, but the longer you stick with it the betterthe series becomes. Well worth the time to get to know!"
1,Terrible,"I got this because of the reviews. I hated it did not even watch the second episode, never mind the second season..."
5,The books are great,"I think all of the books are really good. I read all of them in 1 week, I haven't seen the show yet but I want to. I know when I get my DVD's I will be glued to the tv and I can't wait. So sorry to my kids and my husband until I'm done with them.For all of them people out there that don't like the show don't watch it. If that's the way you feel about it, try reading the books, don't you know the books are always better any ways.That's just like with Twilight people didn't like the movie or the books. Well keep it to yourself because we don't want to here about how it.We love these books and the show and I'm sure were all going to keep on reading them and watching it."
1,The Jason and Tara show,I find myself fast forwarding through all the jason and tara parts so I can see the sookie and bill parts. Don't waste your money. The books are so much better.
2,Not all that great,"This show seems to have some weird (vampiric gaze?) over viewers that misleads them into thinking it is a great show. It could have been so much more, but being rooted in the bad source material is it's greatest foil, I'd have to say. Some of the acting, including the star, is below what I'd expect from a show with a budget this large. As a regular HBO subscriber I was looking forward to this show; only to be bored by episode three at the inane plot and meaningless direction of many of the characters and the MTV/slasher/rockstar depiction of some of the 'bad' vampires. A far better choice would have been to use the extremely superior Ann Rice series or Fevre Dream for a vampire setting; True Blood truly stinks.HBO, oh how the mighty have fallen. The Wire: gone. Deadwood: Gone. The Sopranos: Fuhgetaboutit. Hopefully they'll redeem themselves with The Pacific later this year and with A Song of Ice and Fire in the future."
3,Too raunchy for me,"Love the books, and I'm no prude, but really... The books are sassy, smart ad sexy. The First episode leans so heavily on the prurient I can't see the smarts."
1,TRUE BLOOD: THE FIRST SEASON,"CANT REVIEW SINCE THE SELLER NEVER SENT PRODUCT...NO REPLIES TO EMAILS, AND AMAZON HAS YET TO CORRECT. SELLER IS ""BREAK TIME""....VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED"
1,Loosing my soul. DONT BUY!!,"My soul is disquieted. Blood is sacred. Love is not a sacrificial alter without reason. I long for what seems unattainable, but I WILL NOT pay any price to assauge the yearning.DON'T BUY THIS SERIES!!NEED I SAY MORE"
1,true blood season one,Never got product as promised. Waited over a month and still nothing. I wrote the seller and got a fast reply but no product. I demanded a refund which I got the next day.Do not order from this seller.
1,True Blood is False,"Why is everyone so easy when it comes to vampires. This show is just one step above Buffy. The vampires are the same boring effected quasi-evil, oh so mysterious, gothic rockstar strutting cliche B.S. vampires we've been seeing in pop culture for 20 years now. People said this show had something, that it was different and original. Well, maybe if you've been living in a bubble and haven't seen any vampire related film or TV since Bela Lugosi. The show is rubbish, the writing is horrible, the main vampire hero is just plain mopey and boring, and with the exception of maybe two cast members the acting is mediocre at best- Anna Paquin being the worst. Save your money. I wasted mine, because I trusted the opinions of friends who I thought knew quality TV, and bought the entire season. There has been way better HBO shows than this. Can't believe this show is by the creator of Six Feet Under. Truly bloody disappointing."
4,Worth watching,"I enjoyed the series, just wish I had HBO to catch the new shows. Still liked Moonlight better though. Mick and Beth had better chemistry but True Blood has some interesting characters as well. Sam is one. It was worth buying. I'll probably get the second season when it comes out."
5,Amazing Show,I watched the season and now I'm hooked on this show. The dvd was amazing and the features where pretty funny.
5,I Love This SHOW!,This is one of the greatest shows ever. You will not be disappointed!!! I bought season one on the recommendation of a friend and after watching all 14 episodes I had to order HBO so I could watch season two.
4,"True Blood , season one",I loved this series ( true Blood ) I can't wait for season two to be release.
5,Super-duper amazing!,"The show is great! What more is there to say? If you like vampire shows and want something that is adult rated and quality, then this is the show for you."
4,View into the World with Vampires,"This series is like most HBO shows, raw, funny, and willing to show emotions in different ways. I've read the book and like the changes they've made to the series. The show brings to light the prejudices and preconceived notions that people have in real life toward African Americans, Transgenders, and now Vampires. I really enjoy the way that Vampires are portrayed as another minority group in American society. There are parallels drawn to other minority groups as well as the hatred and fear that some people have. The relationships in the series are dysfunctional, and yet they are real exaggerations of the relationships we all have in our own lives. Very entertaining and I look forward to the second season."
4,TrueBlood First Season,"Great series! Not 100% true to the book, but close enough. Interesting sub-plots added. Highly recommend!"
1,customer error,"I furnished the seller with a 'bad address' to ship to, so had to have the shipment returned. Seller did send in good time."
1,Worst service ever.,"Never received product, delivery date was almost a month after it was placed. I have contacted the seller with no response and was never given tracking information."
1,Damaged DVD's???,What is the problem with the discs in this set.I see a couple mentions on the internet that disc 1 isn't playing?Is this why Amazon pulled it?
3,Where's the bonus?,"I love the series, and am glad I bought the DVD's. But I could not see any reason to shell out extra bucks for the Blu-Ray technology. Also, I really expected more bonus features than the DVD's provided. But I didn't return them, so there you go!"
2,"Interesting, but anti-Christian, Heartless take of the Vampire Story","Women are being killed in a small Southern Community with no remorse shown by their men-folk. A black, queer, racist, drug dealing, male prostitute is presented as a hero in the series. Just about every white character in the show is a worthless, crude redneck. The sex is edgy but very brief, and the violence is brutal and unforgiving."
5,LOVE IT!,"This is a must see. I've been hooked since episode one. It has everything you need: a dark sexy vampire,some danger, the supper natural, and a lot of passion."
3,Should have been better,"The first several episodes were excellent, but then someone who puts this show together thought it would good to include a subplot about Tara and her alcoholic mother. Unfortunately, WAY too much time is spent on this. This is a show about vampires, and the first season is about several murders. So why does Tara and messed up mom get 20 - 25% of airtime? It makes no sense. Even if this is somehow important to the second season, they could have shortened it. Other annoying aspects of this season are the juvenile relationships between Sookie and her suitors and the very stereotyped characters."
5,TRUE BLOOD IS THE BEST SERIES I HAVE SEEN SO FAR EVEN BETTER THAN TWILIGHT,I FALL INLOVE WITH THIS SHOW AND HOPE MORE PEOPLE WATCH IT.... I CANT WAIT INTILL THE THRID SEASON COMES OUT. I WATCH THE FIRST SEASON IN THREE DAYS AND THE SECOND SEASON ONLY TAKE ME ONE DAY TO WATCH. THIS IS LIKE A GROWN UP TWILIGHT. BUT IT IS VAMPIRES LOVE STORIES WITH A COUNTRY TWIST AND BIT OF MYSTERY AND LOTS OF SURPISE IN STORE. ALSO JUST HOT SEXY FUN AND THRILLING SHOW. I HAVE WATCH THE WHOLE FIRST SEASON 4 TIMES ALREADY. I DONT REGREAT BUYING THIS SHOW ON DVD TO PULL OUT ANY TIME AND I CANT WAIT TO BUY SECOND SEASON EVEN SO I SEEN IT ON HBO ALREADY. IAM STARTING TO WANT TO READ THE BOOKS TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENS NEXT. IT ALWAYS HAS SHOCKING START AND ENDING TO THIS SHOW WHERE YOU ARE JUST DRAWN TO WATCH THE NEXT EPOSIDE.
2,"The Show Is Great, But The BR Discs Are Awful","As others have said, the show brings you in slowly and gets subsequently better with each episode. The major downfall is when they try to pull it into simple HBO ""Late Night"" softcore drama.I have one major beef however. There is absolutely no reason whatsoever that this first season should come on so many discs. There aren't very many extras and Blu Ray discs hold more than twice the data of a standard DVD (or so we've been told). To that end, why isn't the first season on one or two discs? What a complete waste of the technology!"
5,Awesome!,The product itself was perfect and was recieved in a great amount of time! The content is just incredible. I fell in love with the series from the first minute of episode one. So glad i chose to buy this!
5,Good Deal,"I wanted to find a better deal for my g-dad since our local medical shop wanted something like $10 a piece for one. If you look around on Amazon and Google, finding something affordable that had good reviews was actually difficult. I'd run into ""poor design, spills, handle is flimsy, tips over easily, top comes off"" etc... Lot of sites want you to buy in bulk too. I took a gamble on this one. Gets the job done and my grandfather is happy with it. Awesome!"
1,Never again,"I bought three of these; one for bedside, one at my home computer workstation, one for the car. The edges are not well finished; The lid is a showpieced only. If this gets knocked over it WILL leak. I'm looking for a better one and throwing these out."
1,Male Urinal in the wilderness?,"If you take this with you on a long walk because you don't want to pee in the woods, then what do you do with it when you're done? You'd either take it home and dump it in your own toilet, or you'd dump it behind a tree. Either way, its weird."
4,Baldwin handleset,"Very nice well crafted handleset. Easy Install, great price adds a sleek finish to the door. Would definitely recommend this product."
4,Cult Comedy Classic!,"Full of memorable characters and quotable one-liners! Pop this in the next time your buddies get together for some beers. Great fun with a great cast!""Dude, I'm so pumped up to chill out!"""
4,Live Light Shines,"This disc is a good document of Ride's 1994 Carnival of Light European tour. The selections are an interesting cross-section of the band's career to that date. Songs like Seagull, From Time to Time and End of the Universe show what a formidable live band Ride was. It is a shame that this release ignored many more prominent songs from the setlist (such as Vapour Trail).What we are left with is a quality recording of one of the better live bands of the '90s. In person, Ride was mindblowing. On Live Light, they are in good form as well. Live Light may not be the ideal document of a Ride concert, but it captures enough that it will leave you wanting more."
4,Undeservedly unknown,"Why aren't these guys getting any credit? Nosaj has got tons of style, and I know Busta had to have copped some of his flow. The bass is impossibly deep, the beats are unlike anything else that's broke in the 90's. Truly freaky, out there hip hop, worth a listen from any style, school, or Coast you claim affiliation to."
5,Welsh's Rare Bits,"From the first poem (""In Defense of Semicolons"") you realize you're in the presence of someone who's grounded in the same world you are but has perfected the art of flight. These are smart poems, often surprising, always human, and beautifully crafted without shoving their artistry in your face. Whether she's exploring the troubling wisdom of her children, the disappearance of Madalyn Murray O'Hair, the demolition of a city landmark, Welsh's writing moves us, makes us laugh, unsettles us in the way the best poetry sometimes does."
3,Mean-spirited reviewers inspired me to buy this book!,"I just had to see what all the fuss was about. A friend mentioned the book to me so I went to find it on Amazon and was amazed by the hubbub. The previous reviews of this book are so vicious, I can only imagine the reviewers have little to do or bear a grudge against this author. Amazing how powerful a slim volume can be, isn't it? This is a perfectly decent first book of poetry by an author who strikes me as totally sincere and working hard to illuminate through metaphor the more important ""moments of being."""
1,Steger-Welsh,"Feelings of frustration are all I have for this text. I had the not so pleasant opportunity to listen to a public reading by Steger-Welsh which strongly affirmed my dislike for this aspiring poet. There may be promise for future writings, but this collection leaves much to be desired."
5,Way cool!!,Yes! This is what the kids wanna hear!!.... Buy this cd and you will not be disappointed.
2,Less practice,You can learn a lot of mathematics in this book but nothing about MATLAB. There is no good practice in this book.A hint for the author. Try to make a CD-ROM with all examples on it. So everyone can get familiar with MATLAB and the surface. Best would be to double or triple the number of examples. (good examples in MATLAB Code)Rethink it and I will be the first who buys the improved edition of this book otherwise you only have to change the title in :Advanced Engineering Mathematics pictures by MATLAB.Thanks for reading.
4,"Long, Random, Fitting","At first you'll think it's a drama/mystery, then you see the bad CGI effects, then it shifts into a sci-fi film, towards the end it shifts to action, and finally it shifts back to drama. The film was placed in the drama/horror section. I thought it was going to be a nice drama dealing with werewolves, but I was wrong. This film was a genre-shifter, it was suprisingly different, kind of enjoyable, and kind of long. It's hard to rate this film. The iron-chef was the best. Now I must eat, watch it for yourself."
4,Not too bad!!!!,I was surprised by this film. It wasn't too bad and I was interested through out the movie and I can't say that for a lot of horror films these days.
2,I can't believe I watched the whole thing,"The voice overs were all out of synch and at times the words indeceiperable. It gets 2 stars only because it was original. But it was at times slow, and almost laughable. Anyone who pays more than $.. for this movie, I think will be disappointed."
2,painfully long,"This film would have been much better if someone had bothered to edit it. It was excrutiatingly looooooooong! By the time it ended, I was bored out of my mind.The cinematography is beautiful, & the story, up to a point, is engaging- but the length! The mystery surrounding the beast is interesting, but when we are finally allowed to see it, it is the silliest looking creature! It's scary, because it rips people apart, but it looks ridiculous! I though it was mechanical, but no, it's a strange species originating from Africa- oh, please!If you like super long movies with redundant action sequences & plot points stretched out with miles between them- than this is a movie for you.If you don't, stay away."
3,Great Movie,It`s a combination of suspence and a kind of The Matrix because of fights whitin the film.Buy it !! You won`t reagret.
1,A Very Bad Movie,"This is billed as a Sci-fi/Kung-fu movie, but it really isn't much of either. While the photography and scenery was quite nice in the beginning, the movies went downhill. Fast. If you enjoy watching indescriminate cuelity to animals and people alike, brutality and murder on a massive scale and incestuous rape, then this movie is for you. Few of the characters had any redeeming qualities, and I found the ending to be a total letdown. I cannot recomend this fim to anyone, and would give it 0 stars if I could. After watching this movie, I felt dirty and violated."
1,not what i expected,"Definately not what I expected. C'mon, a Native American martial arts expert? Not to mention all the other martial arts scenes in the movie. I bought the directors cut and it seems there's 40 more minutes of footage on disc 2. Ahhhhhhhhhh!!!!! I see there's even a 3 disc version! What more could they possibly add?"
3,Fine but..,"The story is interesting, the picture is very nice with marvellous atmosphere; but the acting really... and dialogues are very poor. Samuel LEBIHAN ( ""the little"" in britanny ) plays as well as my socks.Shame, because that movie could have been really good if it had had good actors.Entertainment anywayCheers"
5,a great movie,"Everything is perfect: the cast, the music, the plot. I ordered this DVD knowing that there will be bonus disk with 40 min. of deleted scenes (along with other bonuses) , however, I did not see them. I wonder if something wrong with a DVD copy I received. Would be nice to have an answer to my question."
1,What are you guys thinking,"I really did not like this movie. It was slow pace, didnt really have much of a plot, and really seemed like it didn't had much of climax. I wouldnt recommend buying it, unless you've seen it and liked it. I wouldn't even recommend renting it... it's not worth it. If you really wanna see it borrow it from someone who does own it. Otherwise, you can do better."
1,Where do i start?,"... Granted there are a number of flashy fight scenes andsome unoriginal camera work (that tries, but unfortunately fails toapproach anything like those other movies I mentioned.I thoughtthis movie was misleadingly marketed as an adventure movie when it isquite obviously a horror movie. And not a very good one. I just can'tsay enough bad things about this movie. and what was worse, it waslong. It lacked continuity, likable characters, explanation, or reallyany redeeming quality."
1,Offensive mess,"A female werewolf is ravaging the French countryside, and two naturalists so hetero-... that they might have stepped out of a Monty Python sketch are called in to track her down. Meanwhile they visit a brothel, where are subject to lots of disgusting scenes of naked women. The head naturalist falls in love with a cross-dressing female aristocrat, and his assistant, played woodenly by Marc Dascascos, has ... with some women and is killed. I have rarely seen such an offensive movie: it gets one star because Amazon.com doesn't go any lower."
2,Where's Kermit?,"For a fan of the muppets, I was looking forward to a colaboration between the French and one of the late Jim Henson's enterprizes. It had so many possibilities for Kermit and Miss Piggy. They could have had Fozzy Bear come in and take on the wolf-thing. At least the sex scenes were done tastefully."
4,Beautiful action packed film!,"I watched this film out of curiousity and I'm very glad that I did just that. This film is made up of not only very good acting from all of the actores and actresses, but also contain some of the great and beautiful sceneries as well. Some people knock this film because it contains marshall arts, but come on people, it's not like the fight scenes are pooley done, it's one of the best fight scenes that I have ever seen. This film also containes some eye candies that you will surely enjoy watching. So, why did I not give 5 stars? The only part of the movie that I did not like was the look of the monster. They could have made the monster look more real and more belivable. When I the film finally revealed the monster, I could not help but laugh out loud. The monster looked very fake and silly. Other wise, I would have given this film a solid 5 stars. I could not believe how underrated this film has been with movie goers."
5,Terrific movie with a bare bones American release,But do not worry. If you read Stevenseattle's review then take heart as it is being released as a 3 disc SE Region 1 in Canada. The disc will play on American dvd players absolutely fine. The American release which comes out the same day is virtually featureless.
1,"just a horrible disapointment, really sucks","Really excruciating to sit through, I wanted to leave but the theater was packed. It ends like the cover of romance novel, fabio and all.I love Vincent Cassel, but why did he decide to be in this movie!? If you want a gory french flic done well, stay in and rent ""The Crimson Rivers"" if you have any smarts in you."
3,"5 stars for the beautiful monica bellucci, 2 stars for the rest","this movie is basically an incomprehensible bore. the story makes no sense. it's a ridiculous mish-mash. except for the beautiful monica bellucci. she's spectacular. her (very) brief nude scene is the only reason to even consider keeping this movie. the rest is tiresome garbage, kung-fu action and woodland scenery not withstanding. be forewarned, one very beautiful woman and 2 hours (plus) of incomprehensible nonsense. 2 stars for the movie plus 5 stars for monica bellucci equals a generous 3 stars overall. i wouldn't buy it again. the silly story stinks."
1,This film is rubbish,There are several things wrong with this film. They are as follows: 1) Cheap special effects. 2) Too long. 3) Loose script. 4) Hammy acting. 5) Unrealistic inclusion of martial arts. 6) Soft porn sex scenes. 7) Almost all the main characters. 8) Boring - I don't care what the monster is! I would not recommend this movie. Why did I watch it?
5,AMAZING!,"I've seen the movie twice. I am on the waiting list to get the DVD. I loved the scenes, the actors, the story, everything very well done by this French director who already had done Crying Freeman (Mark Dacascos is Freeman in this movie). I recommend to whoever is interested in some romance, action, beautiful scenary and for the soundtrack fans, try to stay until the ending credits and listen to Felicia Sorenson singing ONCE the ending title, it is beautiful! Enjoy it people who aren't afraid of subtitles and know how to enjoy a foreign language film!"
4,Has Its Ups and Downs,"This movie, while highly entertaining, is utterly implausible in places. There are plot holes a mile wide. Example: Where the [heck] did the Iroquois sidekick learn karate? I wondered why so many guys were lusting after the love interest, whose name I cannot recall. She seemed kinda average to me. So why did I give this movie 4 stars? 1 for the fight scenes, 1 for the Monica Belluci character (Talk about girl power), and two for Mani the Sidekick. It was worth the whole thing just to see him running around in nothing but a loincloth. Mmmm."
4,Lush and captivating,"In the past, movies have hung on richly convoluted political conspiracies, but none recently has captivated my imagination as well as ""Brotherhood of the Wolf"" did. It is lushly photographed and visually interesting even when the occasional 'table talk' slows the momentum. Plot twists and other story-telling devices in this movie do not detract from the growing eerie ""Oh, no - it CAN'T be..."" suspense. How I wish I spoke French and had not had to rely on the subtitles!"
3,Original Idea With Brilliant Cinematography,"What will strike you first is the cinematography of the breathtaking French countryside, and overall, this is the best part of the film.The acting is very good, the idea and script incredibly original. However, there is one point where the plot turns and becomes amazingly ridiculous. In particular, one fight scene between our hero, avenging his brother's death and our villian, a wounded Count, is so over the top preposterous, including the dialogue (which, being subtitled, is a very hard thing to do I would think), that the entire audience burst in to laughter, and trust me, this scene has nothing amusing going on in it.Overall, it is worth seeing. I think perhaps this film got to ""Hollywood"" for itself which is a shame but it is beautiful none-the-less."
5,Enchanted by the Wolf,"Spellbound is an appropriate title for this previously skeptical viewer. In the past I have steered clear of movies with sub-titles feeling I missed much of the body language of the film trying to read what was being said. Brotherhood of the Wolf has perhaps changed my opinion of sub-titled foreign films forever. From the very beginning to the very end it did not fail in any aspect of it's quest to entwine one in it's delicious tale of 18th Century France and the legend of the beast. With a enchanting love story, plenty of action, a historical plot with new twists, and very realistic spell effects, not to mention the breathtaking presence of Mark Dacascos as a Iroquois warrior/priest, Brotherhood of the Wolf to this viewer was as entertaining as Lords of the Ring. And contrary to the Editorial Review - it is Chrisopher Lambert who takes a poor second to Samuel Le Bihan in every aspect. Enjoy!"
4,"Excellent, just too much blood for me...","Note: this movie is in French with English subtitles.In a nutshell, Brotherhood of the Wolf is an excellent foreign film set just previous to the French Revolution about the search for a beast which is roaming the countryside killing people. I would classify this definitely as a ""guy"" movie with plenty of action, fighting, a little sex, blood & gore, and some fantasy/magic...and then some romance thrown in for the ""gals"". It well deserves the R-rating, so don't bring the kids. The sound quality could use a little help and at times the subtitles were a little fuzzy, but the costumes, sets, etc. are realistic, and the special effects were unique to me (very cool dream sequence & weapons). Beyond all of that, the dialogue and story-line actually have ""substance"" which elevates this movie from the typical ""Halloween"" and ""Nightmare on Elm Street""."
5,Superb,"1 of the best foreign film I've ever seen, though I must add the cinematography + action choreographer is superb, but Mark D, give him more credits (wont be disclosing of the movie here), let him stay longer ;P if you know what i mean.All movie-buffs, DON'T give this a miss!"
3,The Movie and Story are Fine; It's Just Too Long!,"Don't get me wrong. This is a very interesting tale, but like so many foreign films, it seems as though its director couldn't tell the story in 90 minutes. Believe me, the gist of this story could be told effectively in a 1950's hour-long anthology.There's no reason for this film to run nearly two and a half hours. A film that runs in excess of two hours should involve major changes for the protagonist (as in ""Ben-Hur"" or ""Gone With the Wind,"") or use the excess time for a powerful denouement, (as in ""Murder on the Orient Express.)Plus, the looping of dialogue is sometimes very distracting. This film may have been better served with subtitles instead of dubbing."
3,"Interesting genre fusion, strange story arcs","This period piece laced with martial arts is interesting to watch, especially considering since it's been 7 years since its release. Undoubtably the angles and camera work are interesting. However, several times I thought the story arcs were strange, and dragging. I felt the movie could have been completed 1/2 hour earlier-it was anti-climactic in parts. The plot reminded me a bit of ""The Village"", where the town had created a beast to keep residents in line. However, that does not take away from the film. I can say that I wish that I spoke French, as I watched the dubbed version yesterday, and found it a bit distracting. It's definitely worth a look, especially if you like mythicism and interesting settings/camera work, but suspend disbelief when thinking about the actual structure of the film's flow."
3,Theatre vs DVD,"The DVD version was not true to the Theatre version in French, with many scenes cut shorter. The same scenes made it to the deleted list with comments from the director, who seems apologetic about the cutting of scenes which he personally liked.I was somewhat disappointed overall, as some scenes make much more sense uncut. Especially the first fight scene."
3,It's okay but could have been a definite 5 star movie.,"First off you have to go into watching this movie with knowing nothing of the history of the plot but if you do know what it's about and anticipate the certain obvious scenes in the film then you will only dull yourself out! First off this film was made in France and the movie is about a legend of France that took place in the mid 1700's of an unknown creature hunting humans and reaking havok amongst the town people. The overall movie was good and the fighting scenes hold up to the fast moving generation of filmmaking today. The only problem I have with the movie is the creature itself, it is made very cheesy and does not suit up to the legend of the brotherhood of the wolf. Overall if your into foreign films then I suggest purchasing the 3 disc collector's edition since it focuses on the myth more with some documentaries but the single disc version is definitely woth the RENT!!!"
1,sadly missinformed,"I went to see the movie based on all the amazon reviews i had read...2 and a half hours later..(and only because after 2 hours i had to stay to see the ending fiasco...) I was disappointed at my waste of a saturday night. The action scenes were exciting but not enough to keep the story line flowing and engaging. The actors were good but the movie was too long, conplicated and drawn out. The beast was comical. The bad 3D effect used for it reminded me of the old Sinbad movies. Visually the landscape shots were gorgeous...but the melodrama at the end got way out of hand. Could have been great."
1,Crap,"This movie started off on a promising note. The photography was lush and beatiful and I thought I was about to watch an old French tale unwind. As it was, it was an hour too long and the story completed drifted from the original plot and became utterly ridiculous. I found myself laughing at scenes that were meant to be serious and foreboding. It just didn't make sense."
1,"""THONGS, WHIMPERS AND A SLIGHT KICK in the ..""","NOW, now now, some things don't travel well, and this Gallic Import from across the pond is somewhat of a flatulent mishap.Sure, it looks fine all misty focus, lots of 'atmosphere', interesting score, attractive leads, so what exactly is wrong? The pace, this one drags along like a bad roadshow version of 'Carmen' and in some cases looks very much like it - also strongly reminds one of the ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" - with the ludricrous beast subbing for old Leatherface and his chainsaw.No, save yourself some time - see this one only IF you must - [gives 'Sleepy Hollow' a bad name].AND possibly the worst dubbing ever! Just what are those accents???"
3,Meh,"First off, NOT for little kids! There's quite a bit of adult stuff in this film. The story is pretty interesting. The monster's real identity is nifty. Action/mystery type of plot. Could have done without the Kung-fu-ish fighting!?!? French and Indians karate chopping is a bit goofy."
2,Doesnt know what it wants to be,Wants to be a European movie but still has influence of American movies like 'Alien' and the 'Matrix'. Too much of a cinematic confussion.
2,Bad marketing,"I thought it would be a huge martial arts movie. There were some key fight scenes that played out well. Then, when the movie opened, I though maybe it'll be a horror movie. Some horror scenes were great too. Those looking for those things probably wouldn't enjoy this too much. What ended up dominating the movie was a love story and a metaphor for revolution, and a bunch of deaths that weren't really deaths or resurrections or I don't know.... Also, it took an hour and 28 minutes for our first real look at the wolf. The beatifully shot French countryside was a definite plus, but too many elements muddled the picture."
2,OK not great,"It was good up until half way thru. First, it wasnt based on true events, it was based on an old french fable. Camera work and costumes were great, plot was good, nice twists and turns but badly executed! I was almost embarassed at how cheezy it was at times. I know this wasnt a comedy but I laughed several times! It delves into all this subplot that would have worked better if it didnt try to come off as this serious/melodrama/hollywood action flick."
5,"French costume horror martial arts film? Yup, and it works.","I admit that the combination of the above mentioned genres sounds as though it would spawn a horrible movie failing in all of these areas. Instead by combining all of these things what you get is a wonderful fantasyish movie with a style of it's own. It is beautifully shot, and shows some of the best martial arts action outside of Yuen Woo Ping (action director on the Matrix and Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon).There are a lot of things about this movie that when you think about it seem out of place, for example a native American martial artist in the 1800's. When I was watching the movie though, those things just didn't seem out of place. Anyway, in the end it was a thoroughly enjoyable movie with a surreal atmosphere and wonderfully shot action."
3,BEASTLY DOINGS,"This is one of those movies I had a hard time deciding whether I Liked it or not! It's way too long (over 2 and a half hours), and it drags immensely in spots. The martial art sequences are dazzingly filmed, and Samuel LeBihan makes an attractive hero; Mark Dacascos does well as his sidekick. But the movie is so burdened by unnecessarily long discussions on politics and religious philosophy. The end title song is beautiful, wish I knew who did it. The cinematography is lush and the mood sustained during the beast attacks is well done.Overall, it is definitely a ""different"" movie, just makes me ambiguous as to whether the investment of time was worth it??"
5,Brotherhood of the Wolf,"I loved this movie. I just saw it on DVD and i think that the story was good and the action was absolutely top shelf. The filming of the action was cool. The only bad thing was that the beast was revealed in the end and it was kinda corny. Other than that, great movie, awesome on DVD."
2,was not what I expected,This movie was more of a love story and the movie itself wasthe worst movie I have seen this year. Dont buy this movie itis that bad.
3,Good plot - Actions Scenes over done,"A very interesting story, well acted. The open scene set a great tone for the movie, but as the movie progresses you start to lose the feeling of the openning scene, since every action scene that follows is done like it is the grand finale.This could have been a great movie if the director would have been more descrimitive about the intensity of each action scene."
2,"Good action and political undertones, BUT . . .","It was a little hard to ignore the kung-fu-fighting Mohawk Iroquois. This wouldn't be so bad if he did not appear in every other scene, which he does. Obviously, the French are unaware (or don't care) that the Iroquois most likely fought by tackling their enemies and engaging them in close combat on the ground, as opposed to flying across the screen or doing a roundhouse. Overall, the underlying political drama and resulting fights are entertaining and draw the viewer into the movie, but the John-Woo-like action scenes really detracted from the story. To sum things up, this would be a great rental film."
2,Not a great one,"My cousin rented this movie thinking that it was about werewolves and well...what a good sleep. What we really enjoyed was the opening and the action sequences, there only few of them but are great; artial marts, vengence, mistery.... I recommend it just to rent."
4,Lots of Fun,"I really loved this film. The style and cinematography are gorgeous, the acting is enigmatic and engaging, and the combat. Seriously. Kicks. Ass. A few people have complained of the plot and the omnipresent philosophising about people, animals, good and evil, etc. but these elements are not crucial to one's enjoyment of the film.This is a movie to watch and have a great time with. I recommend it for anyone who appreciates kung fu or costume drama."
4,Damn Canadians,"First damn you canadians for getting the best version on dvd while we get the also ran. But on to the film...where is the Oscar for foreign film of the year? Its true 10-15 minutes could have been shaved from this movie because of minor relevance but hey its worth dealing with for a very enjoyable movie. Ladies and gentlemen the matrix doesn't own the copyrights on slow mo effects so save your comparisons and just enjoy the film for what it is. It takes the conventional historically based story and breathes new and exciting life into it. The plot was much more do-able than most of the other gunk that were in the theaters this year, cinematography was a beautiful combination that worked perfectly in the end. If you could bare seating through crouching tiger hideen boredom then you'll love this movie. If you need further proof rent it, luv it, then buy it."
4,Brotherhood Of The Wolf,"...Brotherhood Of The Wolf is a seductively stylish film that uniquely blends the conventions of the horror, romance, action, period piece, and kung fu genres to create a story and a theme that is emotionally and intellectually resonant...Many of our greatest film directors model their films for their audience in much the same way dreams effect the dreamer.If you have not forgotten how to appreciate your dreams...I urge you watch this film. Beautiful, powerful, and provocative!"
4,Really cool movie but did you notice?,"I thought the film had a really good story and the action sequences were amazing. The creature looked cool too, but as I sat watching this film with my manager at one of our midnight screenings at the theatre I worked at, I wondered--had I seen this movie before? In a way, this film is a remake of Jaws. It begins with a girl alone getting killed and thrown against a rock, then a number of hunters go out and slaughter a bunch of wolves that they think committed the murder, ultimately to find three brave men to go into the woods by themselves to face the unseen beast. Obviously no martial arts to be found in Jaws, so this element was very well handed with amazing sound effects. This film will benefit with surround sound. I hope the dvd has alot of extras, but if not, the film itself is worth a look or a place on your shelf."
2,sorta silly,"You thought the French only made films of grace, intellect, depth and innovation? Think again. This one proves that the French can make a Hollywood no-brainer just as well as Americans can. Not to say that it isn't mildly entertaining. The action sequences are fun, if overdone. The costumes are fun and the CGI is a bit silly. The whole film is just a bit silly--Sleepy Hollow+the Lone Ranger+Gladiator+Braveheart+Dangerous Liasons+Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon=Brotherhood of the Wolf. Not bad. Not good. If you need a popcorn movie, check it out."
3,don't believe the hype,"Save your money and rent the video.It was not worth the price of the blank that it was copied on.Yet, it had it's high points maybe an hours worth total!The basic movie could have been edited down to forthy-five min."
2,terrible!,"i am completely amazed as i read the other reviews of this movie and have to wonder if we saw the same film.did we?a movie with no characterization? terrible dialogue? a lot of slow-motion action sequences (trying desperately to copy the John Woo style)? a lot of style and glitz but no plot motivation to back it up? and a SUPER hokey ending?and don't even get me started on the character of Mani. i'm from the region Mani is said to come from, and all of the displays of Native American traditions which are presented in this film are fabricated and presented to the point that i was insulted!did we see the same movie?this is a good movie for cutiosity sake but little else."
2,slowly lost its train of thought,"Here is a movie that started creating an interesting and moody quality. Unfortunately, the story began complicating itself for no reason, and refused to come to a conclusion until the audience just decided to leave the theater. I think the film would have gladly continued another three hours but there was no one left in the theater to watch it.I'm a big fan of french films but this director seemed to lose his mind after the first hour and a half and started adding elements which really took away from the movies initial premise. What a shame."
4,"Crouching courtesans, hidden poignards","Review attacking the film for bad acting miss the point; it's about attitude. Lots of that. A bargain for the money is its supply of violence, sex, non-stop action and an obscure but cogent plot. The initial sequence, however, in retrospect made no sense as the pair attacked by the Wolf Men were subsequently revealed to be key figures in their group ??? Almost enough nudity but the ""hero's"" modesty was a bit jarring."
5,Surprisingly watchable,"Normally, I would rather join the Richard Dawkins Fan Club than watch a dubbed film, but this time I was happy to be wrong. An absorbing storyline, beautiful location and costumes, very enjoyable action scenes, and all beautifully filmed. Didn't make to the cinema in time to catch it, but I'm glad I bought the dvd. Didn't even notice the dub.Cool.Baby Cromwell, Nottingham, England"
5,A masterpiece...,"This movie makes Oscar winners look like videos made by Fifth Graders! The story opens in France before the revolution. People are terrified of a beast killing countless people and striking fear in the hearts of all. The cinematogrophy is unreal, the storyline brings you in deeper and deeper, and the characters develop more and more before your eyes. It pushes the 'real vs. unreal' boundries to the limit... and matches it with a story that pulls you inside a different century. One of the few movies that I give a 10 out of 10. A must see... No... a must own!"
5,Captivating tale...,"of horror and fantasy. Based on true events, it blends historical drama with fantastics flights of fancy. Combat scenes were well choreographed, particularly in the deleted scenes included on the dvd."
4,THIS WOLF BITES,"Because ""BROTHERHOOD OF THE WOLF"" went immediately to cult status in its native France (""Le Pacte des Loups""), there are already several foreign versions -- including a four disc set -- in addition to the US Region 1 release.Violent and bloody with gratuitous nudity, this opulent eye candy tells an obtuse story about a mysterious beast that terrorizes the countryside and two unlikely heroes who must face their fears and call on a dark power that reveals a deadly secret. Impossible to summarize here, but, suffice it to say, ""Brotherhood of the Wolf"" includes some of the best choreographed staff-fighting scenes ever recorded. This sophomore effort from director Christopher Gans -- the first was ""Crying Freeman"" -- shows off his terrific eye for composition and action.""The plot is just an excuse for making the movie,"" says French ""Wolf"" fanatic Antoine Doucette. ""It really doesn't matter as long as there's action and mystery and savy and blood and triumph."" Well, maybe."
3,Not about wolves of wolfmen,"This is an interesting movie. You have to pay attention or you'll miss little hints. French movie w/ english language choice so will be annoying to those who cannnot ignore the mouths are moving different from sound. I enjoyed this movie. Not about wolves, but does have an interesting beast attacking the villagers."
5,WOW,"Well what can I say, that hasnt been said already......I wasnt expecting anything from this film, but I was totally blown away. It was just so good, easily one of the most enjoyable films this year. If only America could make films of this calibre."
5,Beauty and the Beast,"The terrible, spooky beauty of the movie, of the scene, of the story, of the fights, of the actors (especially Mark Dacascos, an American-Hawaian who plays an American-Indian as if he had done it all his life and who is totally amazing)And the Beast. Frightening. Go to see this movie. You won't be deceived. It's UNBELIVABLE. UNFORGETTABLE. WONDERFUL!!!"
2,The film had potential...,"There is something vicious lurking in the woods around the mountains of France. It kills, it maims, it eats, and it is terrorizing the people of Gevaudan. On the kings orders, the royal taxidermist Grégoire de Fronsac is traveling to the area with his friend Mani, an Iroquois who is a martial arts master, to investigate the dilemma. These men spend a lot of time in the brothel while maintaining a respectable front and when they have time they perform round house kicks left and right. In all honesty, this film had potential when they began shooting it, however, somewhere in the production the director must have lost focus from the theme."
3,More Werewolves,"I liked it. Basic werewolf story with a twist or two.What more can be said, full moon comes, guy changes.."
4,"Great movie, just a little long.","Listed as 2:24 (actually 2:15 taking out credits at the end) - it has a few 'drone' moments, but overall moves pretty good. It's more a rental, now that I've seen it and know how it ends, it wouldn't make me want to watch it again even though it was good. The surprise element is gone."
4,"A well-made, engaging, God-honoring film","I can't wait to share this film with my kids! Its style is reminiscent of the beautiful BBC ""Blue Planet"" films, but with a Biblical worldview rather than an evolutionary one. I only have a few small complaints: 1) the film was too long and slow--with more concise writing and a single narrator (rather than several), it could have been shorter while being just as interesting and powerful, and 2) some of the camera shots were a bit too shaky (although I'm sure it's difficult to maintain stillness while filming from a boat). Still, it's great to see a high-quality, modern, creationist film like this. Keep up the good work, guys! :)"
5,Love them!,"Ok, so they're not the vinum line. But for those of us who haven't use vinum, these are superb! Love the size, the feel, etc. Great glass for the money."
2,Poor quality control,"I've been a Riedel user for many years, including a set of the Sommelier series. These Ouverture Magnums have been our everyday wine glasses, and when some break I order more. The most recent set was very disappointing, with visible striations on the rim edges from substandard ""polishing"" on all four glasses, and you can feel the roughness when you run your fingernail along it. So think twice or three times before you buy, and recognize that you get what you pay for."
2,Average at best,"Dpn't be fooled by the Riedel name on these. These glasses are average at best, nothing like Riedels higher end lines. Definitely a 'name cheapening' product. Splurge for the Vinum line - you won't be disappointed."
4,VERY large stemware -- but also useful,"I ordered a set of four of the Magnum, and didn't carefully read the size. When the glasses arrived, I realized I could hardly imagine sitting at the dinner table with most of a bottle of wine in each of the glasses. BUT I like the quality, and the looks, and the price, so we don't use them for wine, but for ice water, or iced tea. They work well and look good. I've decided I'll buy some smaller-sized Riedel for wine...."
3,"a decent book, but ""Networking by Example"" is better","This book looked pretty good, but I wanted to point out another book, ""Networking by Example"" by Barry Press which is truly outstanding. This Bible book, as I remember it, contained a lot of information that was specific to Windows 98 and NT as well as protocols and OS's not around anymore. Also, in general the ""bible"" books tend to be cluttered with more information you don't really need. The home networking bible was helpful, but Networking by Example was much more succinct."
4,Game is fun and educational,"I enjoy this game because I was able to create players to make the USA competitive and beat New Zealand's butt in the World Cup. It's a geat game to learn the ins and out of rugby, including positions and general gameplay. Because of the game, I know a knock-on when I see one, how to win a scrum or line out, and generally understsand the ins and outs of the game. Any football fan should appreciate the finer points of rugby, as it serves as the basis for American football. Rugby is a great game and should not be ignored. An incredible tool and fun game for a reasonable price!"
5,GREAT GAME,"this is game is very good for rugby lovers!! even though it is similar to rugby 06, it is better than rugby 06!!! great game!!!"
3,Purchased for the rifftrax,"While I did go see this movie when I was 13, and I did enjoy it, I only purchased the dvd to watch with the rifftrax. I did enjoy it."
2,Handles Broke Off,Loved the skillets until the handle broke off on one and now the second skillet's handle is breaking off. The skillets are great but it was unnerving to see the handle grow hot and eventully separate and fall off. Bought the skillets in Sept 2009. Looking around locally to replace the handles since the skillets are in great shape.
1,"Shallow, poorly plotted, cardboard characters","I read a lot of mysteries, including Hillerman, Michael McGarrity, James Doss, James Burke, but I could not finish Blackening Song. The plot was episodic, with events unrelated to each other and no rising arc of development. Characters' motivations were unconvincing and the characters seemed to undergo sudden and inexplicable personality changes. Dialogue was wooden, with Clah frequently asserting that her ""special training"" made her superior to others. Who talks like that? Clah also ricochets between trusting some characters and suspecting everyone, which was confusing. I've lived close to the Rez and did not find the authors'presentation of the area or culture convincing. You can pass on this one and wait for Hillerman or McGarrity's next book."
1,Buffy on the Rez,"By the time the book got to the terrible evil lurking in the proposed school yard, I thought that we had been transported to Sunnyvale High. Tony Hillerman should feel insulted to have this book compared to his; they are a world apart. Don't waste your time or money - I wish I hadn't."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this book because I wanted to learn about Native American customs and practices in a novel format vs. a reference type book. While it did give me some insight into Navajo culture, the book is written at about the 3rd grade level. It was mildly entertaining if you want a no-brainer type of book. But if you want something you can really sink your teeth into, this isn't it. The characters lack depth and the plot is hokey. I wouldn't recommend this book."
5,A unique collection of rare and underexposed oldies.,"While most of the 16 songs found on this CD failed to chart when originally released on vinyl during the 1960s-'70s, most are fine examples of ""Sweet Soul"" balladry at its best. The songs by Black Ivory, Showtime Inc. ,The Continental 4, The Escorts and The Younghearts are all superb -- the only one that truly qualifies as a miss is Frankie & The Spindles' ""live"" version of the Chi-Lites' classic ""Have You Seen Her?""."
4,The Master Musicians,"Recorded by Brian Jones with his friend, superhippie Brion Gysin, in July 1968, the tapes were edited in London by Brian. This was the first record released by the new Rolling Stones Records label in 1971 (after Brian died). Several authors claim the album started the world music movement that integrated non-Western music into the mainstream of rock.The music is part of an ancient festival that has been linked by anthropologists to the Roman Lupercalia and the truly ancient prehistoric festivals of pan. It celebrates an ancient, pagan-Muslum tradition in the Moroccan village of Jajouka that is detailed in the linear notes by Gysin and Jones. You need to be prepared to appreciate the anthropological context of this music to enjoy it (and although Brian was on a different plane of reality when he recorded this music, he did have a genuine appreciation of the cultural context, as did Keith when he worked with the Master Musicians of Jajouka many years later)."
4,Hypnotic And Lovely,"A very good first record for introduce to the Western World and Music to what Brian Jones loved at the time: ancient music, played with soul, old as the desert its played in, these chants, these ancient trance states are recorded with a great Respect, and the Master Musicians Of Jajouka deliver, as they always delivered and always will deliver, an extraordinary performance, where time and space stops for giving space to the music, to the eternal, to the meditation...Incredible record."
2,Mmmm,"Well I bought this as an LP when it came out and I've still got it. It's been played about 4 times over the years. Usually as a bit of a novelty record. For some reason or other the LP is a bit of a collectors item I believe. I thought it was interesting but can't really agree with...other positive reviews... I was, and still am, really fond of world music and I do have other Moroccan music which I'd listened too more often than 4 times. I think the 30 sec samples here would be enough."
1,Depends on what your reality is,So out of reality that you don't know your girlfriend has taken up with one of your bandmates? This might be for you. Like sitting in your empty swimming pool with an organ and playing after consuming huge amounts of chemicals that make you halloucinate that you're not going to be fired from the world's greatest rock and roll band? Definitely for you. Elsewise you might just want to listen to anything else.
4,Magical music,"I bought the original album (better cover!) on vinyl in 1973 and nearly wore it out. The music was so gripping, so timeless and cross-cultural it made me want to hear more. As soon as I could I went to Morocco but nothing else I heard there had the impact of the music on this album. The recording is so 'live' you can hear dogs barking and the cough of the musicians smoking their kif pipes. Leave western culture and music behind for an hour and listen to this album. If you have an open mind you won't regret it."
5,"""Nothing is true, everything is permitted""","Hassan i Sabbah's phrase, as translated by Brion Gysin, makes a fitting review for this album -- just as the other reviews reveal, everyone will find something different in this strange, hypnotic music. The album is a field recording made in Morocco by Brian Jones and Brion Gysin in 1968, an edited document of ancient Lupercalia rituals dedicated to the god Pan that are hours, and sometimes days, long. (These rituals echo through every springtime rite, from Mardi Gras and Carnival to Easter.) Although the recording has been given a psychedelic gloss it doesn't really need, the result is powerful music, if the listener is open to it. This is an old, old trip -- and the album, originally released in 1971, is considered the first of its kind."
5,Sitz Bath,"The price is right, and the product is great. My Mom is a senior with COPD and other serious health issues, and this has been a life saver for her. She can soak as long as she wants to help her feel ""refreshed."" We use a small tub, filled with fragrant bubble bath, to soak her feet, and this methods lets her maintain her dignity, when she can't make it upstairs to take a full tub bath. When this one cracks or begins to wear out, I will certainly buy another.God bless the inventor of the Sitz bath!!!"
5,Good sitz bath,This fits my commode perfectly.The price is good (i.e. - low).It work well.It arrives ontime.I am pleased.
5,Carex sitz bath,The sitz bath is good and I would recommend it. Anyone suffering from hemmeroids would be happy with the results
3,Rather Small....,"I realize this is a standard-sized Sitz bath, but...how is one supposed to comfortably sit in this thing? WAY too small for me to fit my derriere into -- and I'm thin! Design issues aside, the unit does seem of durable plastic, and the water bag and tube work as they should. Overall, a good version of a peculiar device."
1,worthless crap,"garbage. worthless. total waste of $, time and effort. avoid this seller. scoudrel, cheater, liar. this item is not strong enough to do its job. it's designed to hold water which is very difficult when the sides collapse. a total waste, worthless. hope the seller is ashamed of being a dirty rotten no good scoundrel, cheater and liar."
5,Bottom Issue,"It's an embarassing issue, but when you do have those bottom flare ups, this actually works really good. I had my doubts but it made a believer out of me. So much easier then filling a tub of water too."
4,"Odd, but we loved it!","This is an odd movie. Very artsy, but wonderful. If you appreciate Renee Zellwegar you'll enjoy this. She is such an awesome actress and an amazing singer. She gets to sing a couple of times and I wish she'd do an album. Bob Dylan did all the music and if you like him, you'll enjoy this too.It reminded me somewhat of ""Oh Brother Where are Thou"" in that it is a ""road"" movie and not everything makes sense. All the way through, I kept saying, I don't know where this is going, but I'm enjoying the ride."""
5,Renee Z. Gets Feisty,"This movie is great for a quiet afternoon with some chips and dip. Renee is a great actress and can certainly pull off what is needed to make this movie one to take home to mommy. Life is a bitch sometimes but we must keeping singing our song. Renee does this with the help of a friend, Joey, who sees and talks to angels. He is determined to get her to a place where she must sing again. Grab this DVD and get ready to hit the road with a story that is true to the bone. Renee Zellweger and Forest Whitaker turns a ""song into a journey for a reunion of a lifetime"" as stated on the front of the DVD. Original music by Bobby Dylan."
2,The course is a lot easier than the actual TOEFL test!,"What a waste of money! After finishing the course, I was sure to get the 600 I needed, but to my astonishment, the actual test was a lot more difficult than the course!"
3,Practical but...,"Made a one-click buy, but forgot to check shipping costs. $40 for a product costing $11. Tried to cancel 30 min later without succeding. Thanks a lot...Regarding the product; it's ok. I'm using a Line 6 transmitter. To fit my way of using i have to take it out of the pouch to turn it on and off, so I keep forgetting to do so."
5,"russell wolff, the ultimate wandering minstrel.","i saw russell open up for moxy fruvous last december, and got this album fairly soon after. needless to say, his music is well-crafted, thoughtful, and most importantly, hilarious! he hits popular topics to the opposite field, making you laugh and think simultaneously (see ""if i was a cop"" and ""supermarket"" for details). my favorite thing about mr. wolff, however, is his camraderie with his fans. he remembers people on one sight, and talks to everyone personally. even on stage in front of 1,000 people (see ""betchya bite a live one"", available at his live shows, for details), he is able to really pick up the audience vibe and respond to it (i know from experience; that's the same show where i first saw him). check him out...bottom line: buy this CD if you're ready to bust a gut and still respect yourself in the morning."
4,transformative experience,own several CD's ...... beautifully collected pieces ...... masterfully sung ......... great background supporting music for any activity.
3,It's Incomplete,"The Police is one of my favorite bands from the 1980s. They were one of the very few acts who could sucessfully fuse rock, jazz, punk, and reggae without faking a single move. This hits collection dutifully compiles the group's biggest hits, but hardcore fans will remain a bit disappointed in the track selection. Key album tracks like ""Driven to Tears,"" ""So Lonely,"" ""Bed's too Big Without You,"" ""One World (Not Three)"" would have made this a more complete package. And where's the single, ""Synchronicity II?"" This is recommended for casual listeners, but diehard fans will probably pass and maybe invest in the dynamite box set, which has the band's entire output."
4,"Great compilation, but here's what should have been:","1. Roxanne2. Can't Stand Losing You3. So Lonely4. Message In A Bottle5. Walking On The Moon6. The Bed's Too Big Without You7. Don't Stand So Close To Me8. De Do Do Do, De Da Da Da9. When The World Is Running Down...10. Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic11. Invisible Sun12. Spirits In The Material World13. Synchronicity II14. Every Breath You Take15. King Of Pain16. Wrapped Around Your Finger17. Tea In The Sahara18. Don't Stand So Close To Me '86"
4,Every Breath You Take: The Singles,"The difference between this album and ""The Classics"" is that this one excludes the remix of 'Message in a Bottle' and the original recording of 'Don't Stand So Close to Me'.Most of the hits are here 'Roxanne', 'Every Little Thing She Does is Magic', 'Invisable Sun', 'King of Pain', and, of corse 'Every Breath Take'.The Police aren't really my ultimate cup of tea, but this is a well-rounded greatest hits album, nonetheless."
4,almost the best...,"A&M (I think they still existed back then) reissued the original ""Every Breath You Take"" collection in 1995 with new artwork + a few extra tracks. This would have been a good time to add the badly needed ""So Lonely"" and ""Synchronicity II"", and maybe even ""Driven to Tears"" (personal fave). Instead, we got a pointless remix of ""Message in a Bottle"". If you can find the import _Police Greatest Hits_, it is way better than this. Or maybe you should just smash your piggy bank and spring for the box set... you'll never regret it."
4,Can't stand losing this album,"I really liked this album. It has all the best songs by The Police. I didn't burn ""Every breath you take"", ""King of pain"", or ""Wrapped around your finger"" because i have ""Synchronicity"". Buy this album if you like The Police."
3,The CD layer is good.,It's nice to see Sony came out with a format that competes with cassette tapes.
2,"Fine as in introduction, but weak as an album","The Police are an album band, not a singles band. Each of their 5 albums is quite distinct and each has wholeness to it. The problem is that the ""singles"" suffer when taken out of their album context. The selections are all right, though they foist weird remixes on us, which further adds to the confusion. I dunno: this doesn't really sound like The Police to me. I much prefer ""Regatta de Blanc"" or ""Ghost in the Machine"" in their entirety. I sum I think most people are better off without this cd."
3,The music is great. The remastering is not.,"You have here a perfect concoction of Police music that any fan of theirs will love. What I find amazing is that the engineers that redid this must be VERY bass challenged!!! It is WAY TOO heavy on the low side of the audio spectrum, and in many cases, the singing gets a bit drowned out.A true shame, but the brilliance of these songs withstands even the harshest technical assault.Buy it and turn the bass down."
5,A great introduction to The Police,"I was really into The Police when I ordered this cassette from Columbia House. I admit that the only song that I knew was EBYT. However, after I listened to this album, I realized that they had other great songs. My fav songs are ""Don't Stand"" and ""Wrapped Around Your Finger""."
2,Not a DVD audio disc,"I wish amazon would learn to properly distinguish the difference between a dvd audio disc and a dts cd. This is a dts cd, not a dvd audio disc. The surround mix on this CD is terrible. I prefer the original versions. Sadly they do not include a stereo version on this disc."
4,fantasy,relly nice story; the lion compares to Jesus; the other world compares to different life situations in a life adventure.
4,I lked silver chair the best,"I actually was rather impressed but mostly the Silver Chair. I had read the reviews of it and got two sides. the first three movies were what I would expect for a TV show with the limits of that venue and the year it was produced. Kind of reminded me of the early Dr. Who series ( I love the new ones of that too) I of course, have seen the 3 Disney movies which I love! I hope they go on to do more of the books."
3,The imagination is better in this case,"The idea was great, but unfortunately the casting was not in many cases. The children in The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe were too similar looking in age. Not enough distinction in their sizes and mannerisms. Good White Witch, but she overshadowed the others due to weaker casting. The fantasy characters would have been better if they had been done as a stage production with people in costume instead of the cartooning. Sometimes, a movie lives up to the book, but in this case, it's more fun to just imagine the world of Narnia and the characters who dwell there."
1,Needs to be remade,"Someone out in the movie business needs to remake these movies. The competition is already competing with the Chamber of Secrets and the Two Towers coming out this fall. C.S. Lewis is a genius, a truly brilliant writer. He and Tolkien are my favorite authors. I would reccommend that you should read these books. If you are into fantasy and love reading, then you would like reading The Chronicles of Narnia. I would read the books before seeing the very poorly made movies."
3,Boring!,We found these movies to be very boring. Not much action! I fell asleep during the movie and my son just quit watching them after about 15 minutes or so. It is a nice story but lacks action and the creatures are much too fake looking.
1,"old version, could not tolerate even for 10 minutes, buy the new version","i am not a movie maker, but i could do that much, very simple. deserve 0"
4,Childhood Favorites,"These movies were some of my favorites as a kid. Yes it's true that some of the effects weren't that great. But if you consider when it was made, and the fact that they were tv movies, they are not that bad either. And Aslan looks pretty good I think. The score is wonderful. There are a few special features on here as well."
5,The real thing!,"Older version, not perfect, but oh, so true to the stories! A delight to see again! A treat to own!"
3,Narnia,Enjoyable British version with low budget animation added. I bought it because it is the series of Narnia stories. Well worth the investment.
5,Awesome!,"This movie is great. My son loves the stories, but the newer movie is a little too intense for him. The acting is a bit cheesy, but it is true to the books and is great for very young viewers. If you love the books, you can appreciate these movies."
2,not what i thought it was...,"i was looking for the new version. this one should be explain as the older version. I should have looked more closely at it, before buying."
2,"I thought I was getting the movie, not this made for television one.",I had hoped this was the movie version. I am hoping to be able to return it and get the movie version.
2,Sometimes older isn't best,"I often like the older versions of movies. I don't need the more involved details and special effects but in this case, well, after seeing the newest releases, this set is hard to watch. I've tried several times and I can not force myself to watch. I have seen most of it little snippits. I like the fact that the young actors are not in as much intense fighting which I find is way over done with the newer versions. :( I'm dissapointed."
1,Waste of money,"I was really looking forward to viewing the DVDs. I've loved he books for years, so I was predisposed to enjoy the DVD's. However, the special effects were very poorly done, and the overall effort was very disappointing. I found very little to praise in this package."
2,Chronicles of Narnia,"The DVD version left me flat. The book series is much better, takes longer to finish but well worth it. No justice is done by these movies. If I hadn't read the book would never have finished watching the movies."
5,The REAL thing!,"These are irreplaceable. They have what disney neglected to include... a human-ness to everyone, intimacy, emotion and character development. We have had these movies now for over ten years, and we all love them. Aslan IS Jesus in this movie, in disney's reproduction, he is a lion...... what more can I say."
5,Excellent Product and Value,"Great DVDs. Wonderful buy for those who love the movies. Product was as described, shipped fast and were very well packaged."
3,A blast from the past,I bought these movies because when I was younger i watched and enjoyed them whenever i went to visit my grandmother. Now that I'm older I may not enjoy them the same way as i did when i was 6 but they are still fun to watch.
4,"Generally Good Interpretation, w/Dated Effects - Recommended!","This BBC ""The Chronicles of Narnia "" DVD set includes ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"", ""Prince Caspian"", ""The Voyage of the Dawn Treader"", and ""The Silver Chair"".These were made for English TV in the '80s and early '90s, apparently with a fairly small special effects budget. While the story keeps mostly to the spirit of C.S. Lewis's fantastic booksThe Chronicles of Narnia, the acting was generally good (Tom Baker was a fantastic ""Puddleglum""), however the costumes and special effects are so bad that modern kids may be put off (although my teenagers found them to be a hoot, especially the ""big fight"" scene with the snake near the end of ""The Silver Chair""). We really did enjoy the sets and the authenic English settings (including the castles).These DVDs are worth having and are very enjoyable. Recommended!"
5,"The Chronicles of Narnia - (3-Disc Set) - (The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe/Prince Caspian & The Voyage of the Dawn Treader","VERY HAPPY WITH FILMS, MY CHILDREN LOVE THEM. ALSO VERY HAPPY WITH AMAZON.COM(WAS UNSURE ABOUT ORDERING ONLINE AT FIRST BUT VERY GLAD TO BE PROVEN WRONG)."
2,average,Not what I expected. I lost interest before the first movie was over and did not watch the other 2.
3,The making of the Chronicles of Narnia,last i herd the Lion the witch and the wardrobe will be released on the silver screen in summer of 2004 and is directed by Andrew Adamson (directed Shreck) and screen play is adapted by Ann Peacock more info from the following sitehttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0363771/
2,The Chronicles of Narnia (3-disc set),"I would have wanted to know if this was an older or newer version. After purchasing and viewing it saw that it was a drama and not what I had wanted. I have the a DVD of The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe which is a newer version."
5,If you have seen the recent Hollywood version,"This will seem a little hokey, Hokey is good it is really cute and it stayed true to the Books. It worth the investment and a deeper understandiing of the story behind the story.Your Children and all who see it will love it. It is a 5 for sure"
2,cronicle,"was not what i expected, where not the movie but the play and some of them the end was not on the disk the end was left out."
1,The Chronicles of Narnia,VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!These are 20 min story flicks that is nothing like the movie. Wish I would have never bought it...What a waste of money.The movies are great but that is not what this is.....
1,"Mis leading, this is not what you think youre buying",This is highly mis leading and Amazon and its customers should be aware of it. This is not the DVD youve seen here in the states. This seller is selling a DVD set of the BBC made for TV movies. This is a cheap low budget PBS style version of the movies meant for TV in England. dont waste your money. Unless of course the BBC made for TV version is what youre after.
1,Very Disappointed,"I found the description of the product to be misleading. I needed a more detailed description of what the DVD included. I was very disappointed. The DVD was nothing like I expected. Additionally, I don't understand how to know if the product is what you expected without opening it. However, once this is done; the DVD can not be returned. My suggestion is to call or email provider asking for more details of the product."
1,Old Narnia,I thought that I was purchasing the new Walt Disney Narnia. I didn't realize there was more than one. Compared to the new release this one is torture to watch. I tried to give it to the library and they didn't want it either. They had this version on VHS and said that no one ever checked them out.We bought the complete set of the Disney version of Narnia. Those I can honestly say are fantastic.
2,Time for a remake,I watched this on PBS as a kid and was disappointed. Aslan looked totally fake. His mouth didn't even move when he talked. I'd like to see all the Chronicles of Narnia be made into movies now that we have the technology to do it. There could be a CGI Aslan that would actually look alive.
2,British Broadcasting not as good as Disney,"I was disappointed after I received Chronicles of Narnia. It was not the Disney production I saw in the theater. The story was pretty much the same; but, the special effects were not so special."
2,It's ok....,"I got this last month because I had read the books and wanted to see a film version. None of the Characters look like Lewis described them. Plus the witch looks like a drag queen. The movie is hard to get into and not very captivating, I had to drink quite a few cups of coffee to stay awake through just the first one. I understand that they didn't have as much technoloy as there is now, but the movies could have been made somewhat better. I would suggest watching these, but don't buy them, its a waste of your money!"
4,Back in the day.,"I used to borrow these from the local library when I was a kid. And saw it and had to buy it as a DVD set. I remember being scared of the White Witch, I think because she is so loud, but I had a great time watching them again 17ish years later. Wonderful story and fun to watch. I have watched the new Chronicles of Narnia and wasn't as big of a fan, much more CG and effects, but less entertaining I thought."
4,So Great,"I used to own these on VHS, I watched them religiously as a little kid, I know the graphics are really bad, sometimes laughable, but as a little kid that didn't bother me. These aren't computer generated blockbusters, but they do a great job of telling C.S. Lewis's classics.Overall, great series that follows C.S. Lewis's books very closely."
4,Great for now,"these dvd's just leave you kind of hanging, but its okay. I believe the only reason that we don't see all of the books on dvd is because production and costs would have cost too much in the time these dvd's were created. It shows in the cartoon demons and griffins and monsters that are everywhere. Sometimes i wish NBC or some big network would do the thing for a pretty long miniseries. There has to be some following in the United States for Narnia. until then, you have to settle for the best the BBC could offer."
1,BBC version not as children friendly!,"The BBC didn't do as good a job as Walt Disney, would not purchase this again had I known it interluded every 10 min to give the credits to what section was just viewed. It doesn't hold childs attention because of the constant interruption. Music score is very loud, the color is poor. Bad purchase."
1,Do Not Waste your $,I bought this for my son and we love these movies and we were very disappointed to see that the format of these movies are live shot and not the one we had previously had rented...totally different format and a waste of my $. I guess that is why this package deal was so cheap...first time I have evr been disappointed with my Amazon order..Had I known I would have spent the extra $ on the 3 dvd set that we originally watched.
1,Narnia by BBC,"I bought this series, but did not realize until I started to watch it that it was not what I wanted. I wanted the Narnia from Disney and did not realize that the product I got was a BBC version. Amazon should have highlighted somewhere that it was a completely different movie from what those in the US would be looking for.I watched about 5 minutes, until I realized that the characters did not look familiar."
4,"Yay for accuracy, boo for animation","I'll be perfectly honest with you, these movies are not the best. While the U.S. was making movies like Tron, BBC made this. *yikes* However, I will say that the movies are filmed almost line for line out of the books. The acting is curious, the sets are funny, the casting is even more curious, but if you want your child to watch something adventerous and more wholesome, this is your movie. I watch these movies quite frequently. I'll put it on in the background while I'm studying or watch it for comic relief with my friends. Although rough and (at times) horribly green screen, I do recommend this set."
1,Reproduction not original,"I received this item quickly with out a hitch but it was not what I though I was ordering. These three DVDs were not the original movie. They are a reproduction of the original. These seem to be done by BBC. I was quite disappointed when I started watching the first DVD. The acting is quite poor. I went back on the ad to see if anywhere it said they were a reproduction. I should have know with the price and the picture on the cover. If you are looking for the original movie, THIS IS NOT IT!!"
2,There are better courses to buy.,"If you are travelling to Ireland, and feel a need to learn just enough Gaeilge to get by, then this is a good course for you to try. The purpose of it is just to teach you phrases so that you could say enough in the language to, for instance, order a lager at a pub. These types of tapes are great if going to Italy, France, Germany etc., and there being a great need to know a bit in those particular languages. In Ireland, however, there is no need to learn Gaeilge. Everyone speaks English, but not everyone speaks Irish! You should have no trouble at all ordering your lager at a Rose&Crown Pub. This defeats the whole purpose of the course. If you are truly interested in learning Irish, there are better courses to buy. If you just want to impress a few Irish people with your phrases in their native tongue, then don't waste any more time reading me, and buy the tapes=)"
2,You get what you pay for,"Inside the plastic shell casing you will find 2 cassette tapes instead of a CD/DVD so if you don't have a cassette player, you are out of luck. Inside is a 2005 catalog.The phrase dictionary included is helpful.Product could be vastly improved if they upgrade to a CD/DVD format."
5,A Classic!,"I really enjoyed this televsion series when I was a young kid. The music is really inspiring, the puppets of the Lion (Aslan) and the dragon are very realistic. It doesn't have the modern 3D animation like today. But I feel the orignal film tricks and the realistic animals really made this classic C.S. Lewis's story come alive.The DVD is in excellent condition and it is closed captioned which has made this hard of hearing person very happy!"
5,A really nice movie!,"Prince Caspian and The Voyage of the Dawn Treader is a nice movie. The graphics aren't so great, but you have to realize that this movie was made like, in 1990. But if you are a true fan you should get this movie.-Zach Mashburn"
2,Okay,"just like the first one this one was okay, prince caspian was very short but the dawn treader was not all that bad. this was on okay movie still disney's version of prince caspian was better and i think thier version of voyage of the dawn treader will be awesome to"
2,The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian ~1990~,"This is the worst of the BBC ""chronicles of Narnia""trilogy. While the story of Prince Caspian is worthalmost 4 stars, the dawn treader story is boring anddone poorly. I understand that this film is 13 yearsold, made for TV and for children, but the scene withthe dragon is so badly done. I would have liked the BBCto elaborate more on ""prince caspian"", but I understandthey had to inlcude the ""dawn treader"" because we areintroduced to one of the main characters from ""the silver chair"".I liked ""the lion witch and the wardrobe"" and ""the silver chair"", but they will cost almost the same seperatly as the complete triology boxed set. I think older fans(13+) shouldskip this film, but younger fans(12 and younger) may like it."
2,told the story - but - not like the newer movies that have come,"This movie tells the story - but after seeing the first two Disney versions of the other stories, this is lack-luster. I can't wait for the release (though not Disney this time) of the same title this Christmas 2010."
2,missig DVD,"I haven't received this DVD yet, so, i won't be able to give total review of item until i do receive it."
1,Horrible special effects,"I watched the Lion, the Witch & the Wardrobe & I was able to overlook the bad special effects (lion) because the actors were good and the story was good. However, the Prince Caspian video was truely horrible. The story was boring and the special effects were really bad. I couldn't finish watching it & stopped before it was half-way done.I loved reading all the books in the series. I am hoping that someone will make a wonderful movie series out of the Chronicles of Narnia. I am hoping someone that has as much passion as the man who is now putting out the Lord of the Rings movie series, will take an interest in CS Lewis. That will be truely marvelous."
1,SO! SO! STUPID,"This is not worth watching, unless you want to laugh at the poor special effects, stupid acting,and the obviosly fake battle scenes."
1,why so expensive?,Can someone explain why this book is $114.? I don't get it. I actually haven't read it but want to order but this makes no sense.
4,"Murder, misdirection, and some mysticism","This is the 4th book in the China Bayles series. This story revolves around the shooting death of Rosemary, China's tax accountant, who was shot while driving her partner McQuaid's truck. McQuaid believes it was a case of mistaken identity and that China was the real target of a recently released convict that McQuaid put away. The other prime suspects are Rosemary's ex-husband and her fiancee. The book also deals with some of China's relationship issues in adjusting to living with McQuaid and his son. Unfortunately, I figured out who the killer was very early in the book. I got a little frustrated with China and her issues, but it was fairly realistic. I enjoyed seeing Sheila (Smart Cookie) again, and it was interesting that she was even more skeptical than China about the mystical elements in the plot . On the whole, it was a pretty good book, but not my favorite of the series so far."
2,Very simplistic mystery...,"Any regular mystery reader can figure this one out before it hardly gets started. Also, I feel the series is going downhill fast, specifically because of China's control freak boyfriend. Lose the man, China!"
3,Too much of the occult,"Rosemary Robbins is China Bayles' hard-working accountant. When China runs an errand to Rosemary's house, she finds her dead from several bullet wounds. There are no lack of suspects, as Rosemary has an angry ex-husband and two women who are jealous of her new relationship with a man named Jeff. Then, there's a man that China's live-in boyfriend McQuaid helped put away, who is now out of jail. China and her friends do some investigating, despite the fact that McQuaid does not want her to become involved. Before it's over, her friend Ruby convinces her to consult with Ondine, who uses Ouiji boards and communicates with the dead. This book seemed to delve into the occult more than was necessary, but it did develop the relationship between China and McQuaid's son, Brian."
1,Should have read the details closely!,"When I purchased this video I was in the classroom moving swiftly after we couldn't get a DVD about the Grand Canyon to play properly. I went to Amazon's streaming and available videos and quickly selected one for showing to fourth graders. When I started it rolling I quickly became aware that it was just a religious interpretation of the geology, etc., and stopped it immediately. I then selected an appropriate video on the Canyon for the students. It was my own fault, actually, as in my haste I neglected to inspect the details in full. Still, promoting it as science is a bit disingenuous (perhaps a minority of potential viewers may disagree, but, then, I disagree with them). I would like a refund but, as I said, partly my own fault."
4,Key Blanks,Received the key blanks they were on time. They were of good quality and a good price. I would purchase them again. Thanks
2,Poor Packaging!!!!!!!,"While the items arrived in a timely manner, there was absolutely no packaging in the box to protect the wine glasses. Unfortunately, there were broken glasses. I returned them indicating what had happened in transit and they sent out a new set- with no packaging. Once again we had broken glasses.Did someone actually think four sets of wine glasses would survive a cross-country trip on a truck with no wrapping or packaging?"
3,Overture Wine Glasses,"I assume you are referring to the first glasses I received and not the replacement glasses I ordered, which I have not received as of yet. Nothing wrong with the actual glasses, but I think they were mis-represented as red wine glasses. They were way too small for normal red wind glasses. I may not have looked at the actual measurements. So I sent them back and ordered the real red wine glasses. Suggest a change in the description of the glasses."
5,Riedel red wine glasses,The item was shipped fast and packed where none of the glasses could get broken. The product was exactly as described.
5,Very nice wine glasses!,These wine glasses are great! I've bought Riedel wine glasses in the past and have always been very satisfied with them.
4,They don't ship well,"But they're nice. We ordered 8. The first box from Amazon got here with 5 broken. I wrote Amazon and they refilled the order with a brand new box of 4 which would have given us nine. It wasn't to be. One was busted in the second box. Now we have eight, after having been shipped 12.They're very nice. A little delicate looking, so I'd recommend keeping them out of the dishwasher..Don't really see how Amazon is making money on these.."
2,Not Red Wine Glasses,"These glasses are not red wine glasses as I know them. They are narrowly fluted, as white wine glasses are. Also, be warned that if you buy these glasses, you are not buying them from or through Amazon. The return must go to and through CentralChef. CentralChef charges a ""restocking fee of up to 20%,"" requires you to have an RMA code (whatever that is), and does not answer its phone during business hours--in other words, does everything in its power to discourage returns. I expected better from Amazon."
2,These are far too tiny to be real wine glasses,Read the dimensions carefully on this one because the picture makes them look like real wine glasses. They're not! They're tiny little taster glasses that can't hold a proper 5 ounce pour without being too full to benefit from the fancy shape (too little head space for proper bouquet or slosh-free swirling).If you just want cute little wine glasses you can get them much cheaper and they'll work just as poorly. If you want proper wine glasses to do all that sniffing and swirling you need ones that are much bigger.
5,The Beautiful Mind and Heart of Bl. Duns Scotus,"It is not a documentary on the life of Bl. Duns Scotus, nor is it a comprehensive theological treatment on the articles of faith; but I still enjoyed watching the movie. The conversations and the debate revealed in some way the thought processes of the theologians of that era. As the movie portrayed the devotion of Scotus to the Blessed Virgin Mary, the movie reminded me of how God lifts up the lowly to do great things - the humble beginnings of a ""dunce"" who later became a respected teacher, and a poor friar who debated against the intellectual powerhouse Dominicans - and succeeded. I think it is a beautiful movie and it made me appreciate the beautiful mind and heart of Bl. Duns Scotus!"
2,Full disclosure would have been nice,"The story is terrific. I think the fact the movie was all in Italian with English subtitles could have been in bold type somewhere.Did I miss the ""English"" option somewhere along the way?"
2,Both copies are in Italian with English subtitles. I saw Duns S. on EWTN network with audio in English. Can I send both back?,"It is difficult for my family and me to read constantly the subtitles. Always like English Audio.EWTN showed this Duns Scotus on their network in English Audio. Can I return both dvd's sent to me now?I bought one initially and requested English audio as an exchange. You sent a second one with English subtitles instead of English Audio. I have one return label, I need another label or can I send both in one package? I will pay the postage as demanded. An early response is required.Thanks for your efficient service. Will continue to buy from you.Neville Lacey"
3,Interesting,"But not really my cup of tea. I bought this cd based on the sterling reviews I read here; and if you don't mind run-of-the-mill, synthed-out background instrumentation, then you may very well find this recording satisfying. I just wish the music matched her unique vocal style. There are some interesting things here, namely Anina's ability to sing in Arabic, French and English on different tracks and somehow make them all sound like they belong on the same cd. No small feat. One can only hope that Anina chooses better and more challenging musical accompaniment in the future--then we would truly have something special on our hands."
2,only if you are right into sci-fi,"I didn't really like this one, I am a bit conservative with my campaign, and couldn't really take it seriously; Sci-fi is great, but not (for me) incorporated into a fantasy setting. I found it a bit over the top. If you want to incorporate a little Sci-fi into your campaign, i'd recommend I10 - Needle, which introduces a few aspects (lasers, interstellar travel) in the background, without tkaing over the entire adventure."
4,A Worthy Addition to any Early Vocal Collection,"I pretty much must echo what the two previous reviewers have already written. I listen to early vocal music on a casual basis, and I'm nowhere near being nowhere near an expert, but this disc is on my shelf along with Dufay and Binchois and other composers of the Franco-Flemish School. Two motets and several chanson are spread across this disc, with the Missa O Crux lignum more or less in the middle. The former elements are marvelous, and the mass is exquisite. The voices of the Orlando Consort, both singly and in concert, are quite heavenly. This is a keeper."
1,Strap Problems,"I had this case for a year with no problems, but then the strap broke unexpectedly. Apparently the piece of fabric that attaches the clasp to the body of case was held on with glue; not stitched or however else you would logically secure a load-bearing point. Also, the bell area was slightly too small for the bell of my instrument (Holton)."
1,Gig Bag,This case is slightly better than a paper bag. If you absolutely have to have a case with minimum weight and bulk this might be your best bet.
3,Wonderful Read-Along But...,"What I like about this is that you get 4 complete stories in one book. They are read in a pleasant voice and stick very closely to the Disney movies. My girls love all the movies and also love these stories.What I do not like is that there is no chime to tell you to turn the page. This makes it harder since none of my girls can actually read yet. They just have to guess at when to turn if they are using this independently, which they often want to do. I still think it is worth the purchase price, but a chime would greatly improve the experience and get this my 5 star rating."
2,SELF SQUIRTING VALUE,Great value for [...]. Positives: holds a large amout of soap; unit can sit next to sink so user drippings and misses drop into sink and not onto vanity; sturdy unit; basically silent action of dispensing; does not drip soap as some other brands do. Negative: it could dispense more soap volume on the MAX setting.REVISED 2/2010 - The unit began to dispense less and less soap until it died completely. I would have hoped it would have lasted longer. It is made in China so you get what Miss. Wongs 3rd grade class can produce.
2,works for a while,The dispenser works along middle quality. mine lasted 10 months with normal use. It is unhandy to fill and doesnt have a fill indicator light. batteries are at top of unit and not difficult to replace--replaced every other month with energizers.I had a smaller unit which i puchased for about $10 from avon; it lasted about 3 years when it quit----I replaced it with this one and am again looking for a replacement less than a year later after paying almost 3 times as much for this unit.needless to say: I am disappointed with this unit.
2,Soap and More,The spout is too short for dispensing to your hands very well! Buy the one at Sharper Image instead!
1,One Out of Three Units Worked for Me,"I've had three of these. The first one is still in use after two or three years. It dispenses very small amounts of soap, even on the highest setting, but it works. It usually takes a couple of tries to get it to go on. I liked the idea of a touchless soap dispenser so much that I ordered another one. The second one stopped working after only a couple of weeks. I ordered a replacement and it,too, stopped working after only a few weeks. From my experience, it looks like this product may not as well made as it was years ago. It is awkward to fill, but I wouldn't mind that as long as it worked for me."
3,Ok,This is a nice product to use with hand soap. Just doesn't work as well with hand lotions or sun screen.
4,Not really a curl booster BUT an awesome product,"This didn't boost my curls. Well to begin with I don't have curls just waves. The awesome thing about this product is that It makes my hair shiny, controllable and I don't have frizzy ends anymore!! I actually got compliments. I didn't really notice a difference except for the frizz gone but other people noticed and I was kinda surprised. I will keep using this and I do recommend this to people with curly hair. Don't expect CURLS to magically appear because that will not happen. But for the frizz and other minor problems expect little that goes a long way in making your hair look better."
2,Downhill,"I have been using a Norelco ""9160XL SmartTouch-XL"" since December 2005. It gave a wonderful & adjustable shave. One of the three plastic drive connection to one of the heads recently broke off. Fixable, but impossible to have repaired. So I purchased (and returned) a new Model 8140. Shave results (I use a powder stick base)are noticably inferior as is the feel of the razor. Construction is noticably ""cheaper"". No head shaving adjustments available. I have been using Norelco electric shavers for over 40 years. This model is a great dissapointment. It appears that they are determined to push me into trying a model 1050X! Time for a Braun?"
2,Underwhelmed,"I bought this razor at Target because it looked like the latest model. The instructions say to give it 3 weeks to expect the best shave because your skin has to get used to it. after 2 weeks I wouldnt even look at it. The shave is poor, after shaving I had a 5'oclock shadow! The blade was iritating as well. Nowhere near a close shave. I can't wait to send it back."
3,It's OK,"Got this for Father's Day. It was purchased at Target. It's been an OK razor. Nothing spectacular. The battery performance has been good, and it's been nice to be able to rinse it out under running water. I didn't have those features with my last razor (Remington Microscreen). The trimmer also works well.I wouldn't recommend this razor to someone whose facial hair grows quickly. It would be a nightmare for someone like that. I have a baby face (my wife makes fun of me for it!) and when I shave with this razor, it takes me a good while to get everything. I have to make multiple passes, and it's very difficult to shave the chin area. It's also a bit painful when I shave after skipping a day.In short, I'm satisfied with this shaver, but I'm not happy enough with it to recommend it."
3,CoolSkin is Better,"I recently received this shaver as a gift. It replaced my Braun 360, which in my opinion was a terrible shaver. I used this Norelco for 2 months and it provided a better shave than the Braun, specifically on my neck. However, I brought out my old Norelco CoolSkin and the results were even better. My CoolSkin gives me a closer shave in a shorter amount of time. The reason I stopped using it was because I grew tired of replacing the lotion cartridges. Well, I will just have to put up with the lotion costs and messy cartridge swaps."
2,Li-Ion Batteries are NOT a plus.,"The shaver is great, the HQ-8 and HQ-9 heads are worth every penny. The problem is Norelco's switch to Li-Ion batteries for their top end shavers. These batteries have two problems. First, they only last 2-3 years from the date of manufacturer and Norelco shavers do not work with a cord after the battery fails. Second, when they drop to around 50% charge level, the speed of the motor drops and the quality of the shave really goes down.I love Norelco shavers; I have used them for 40 years. It is a shame that battery technology still has problems."
5,Victory Live!,"If you are looking for a high energy Gospel Concert, look no more. This DVD is the one for you. The singers are truely talented and spirited. The young people would agree this concert would be highly reccomended. Tye Tribbett, the lead singer, is taking Gospel music to a new level. This DVD would make a nice present for all ages."
2,Just O.K!,"After waiting patiently for the DVD to arrive after listening to the CD time and time again. I was a little disappointed in the production and the obvious lip syncing from the choir. In my opinion, they move around way too much on every song, including praise and worship. If you have seen Kirk Franklin's ""Rebirth"" Video then this will disappoint you when you compare the two. The music is excellent! The performance, unimpressive! That's my two cents. -Pax-"
4,Excellent Ton,"This bell was the perfect solution to our needs. We had the need to be heard in other parts of the house without screaming. This did the job. My only complaint is that if it gets wet for some reason, it rusts easily if not dried immediately. It would be the perfect purchase for many reasons. Classrooms, playgrounds, calling in children from playing outside, or as in our case, being able to get attention at home without screaming."
5,running wolf sterling silver ring with turquoise wolves,This ring was nice quality for the money. The running wolves little smaller than I had pictured them. The ring itself is nicely cut and polished. The running wolves are accented in turquoise and detailed nicely. This ring looks sturdy enough to be worn everyday with casual attire. Ring runs small tho should have ordered a larger size fits rather tightly on my finger. Would make a nice gift for anyone who loves wolves or native american style of jewelry. Very versatile for any woman or man who wants a unique looking ring.
5,An Eye Catcher,"This ring is very special. I bought it for my husband and many people have noticed and commented on its beauty. It is such a lovely and shiny silver and the turquoise wolves make a beautiful contrast. This is a unique ring and it is interesting because of the Native American component,being that it is a story-telling ring."
5,Excellent and considerate service,I got a quick response when I inquired about when a size 7 would again be available. The sales person even E-mailed me when it came in and offered to hold one for me. I also love the ring!
3,Rather disappointed,"I used part of a gift card to purchase this ring. The card was a gift for my 75th birthday. It is an attractive ring, but not worth the price. It looks as if it could be purchased at a flea market for 10.00 tops. The advertising picture was better than the item. (First time this has ever happened, right???) Just sorry I used my gift money, but unfortunately, ""you learn by doing.""."
2,Glop,"Nobody is going to love me for saying this, but Jim O'Rourke's essay in experimental elevator music is all dressed up and nowhere to go. He gets ten points for trying different things with many instruments, and another few points for creating modern music which isn't rock, isn't anything remotely like rock, but I have to take all those points right off him because there are No Tunes At All on this album. There should be a sticker on the front : ""Warning! Tune-Free!"" So it comes and goes in a fairly unobjectionable way - apart from ""Women of the World"" which is the Most Aggravating Song I heard since ""Kitty in a Basket"" (you never heard that one? I must play it for you one day.)(Jim O'Rourke worshipped at the shrine of John Fahey, as I do, and his best album (of the ones I heard) is ""Bad Timing"" which is his most Fahey-like music; but hell, why not just listen to John Fahey instead?)"
4,eureka ! i have discovered jim o'rourke......,"i've had this album sittting on my shelf unplayed for a couple of years .The other month out of curiosity i gave it a spin and it is now a permanent fixutre in my cd player. On the surface it really shouldn't work, pretty and moody pieces like the title track and 'ghost ship in the storm' sit along side campy singalong tracks like 'something big' and plaintive folk like 'women of the world' . Yet somehow it all melds together and listener just goes with it. I have to confess whenever i see the word 'experimental' associated with anything i shudder inwardly taking it as euphenism for 'crap', but o'rourke shows you can be experimental and make different but emotionally resonant music"
5,Very Accurate...Very Simple,Replaced two Honeywell's that were horribly innacurate. The White Rodgers 700 is so much more professional and accurate...to the degree! You set it at 68 and you get 68. The lighted display and large numbers make it very easy to read. It works very well and I will always buy this brand now.
3,$35 For This???,It's an okay product to have for your car emergency but $35 for this is too much. I would consider this for $25.
4,Road Pkg,"Just what I needed,had everything I wanted,It comes in a Great Case,Nice and Neat! Stores Under The Front Seat,Just Perfect!"
4,A must-have!!,I feel that if you are a driver you should have this in your vehicle. This package has just about everything needed if you should experience a car emergency. This purchase is well worth the money.
4,AAA road assist kit,"Product was received in a timely manner. All of the are useful, however, the addition of a tire iron would have been helpful."
3,great to have in the car.,"purchased this when my car battery died in carpool line one day and i didn't have jumper cables. while i feel better about having an emergency kit in the car at all times now, i feel i really could have spent the money on ""really good"" jumper cables and and put together the rest of the ""kit"" myself. not the best bang for the buck, but it serves it's purpose and i'm glad i have it."
4,Decent kit for going on the road,"Had to use the jumper cables and while they worked, they were a bit on the cheap side and a little short.The kit is good in that it has all of the basics you'd need in the car during a basic breakdown. All in all, the kit was a convenient thing to have and I feel like I paid more for the convenience of being able to buy everything in one pack than the actual items themselves. Anyone could put this together, but not everyone wants to be bothered to do so.I am happy we purchased this kit. It has everything you need for a basic breakdown. I put it in our van that we use for family trips."
3,Roadside bag and first aid kit,It was nice for the roadside equipment but the first aid kit that comes with it is very limited. I had to buy another first aid kit which is what i was trying to avoid.
4,This takes me back!,"Only complaint is plastic parts stick and don't work like they're supposed to - I want to exert some force on it but was afraid it was going to break. However, I have only 'transformed' Optimus one time and I am hoping that after a few transformations it will loosen up some. The problem I had was on the leg, when I pressed the fuel tank it wouldn't release the leg to slide into truck-mode. Overall I am very impressed with it. Every detail was thought out. The tires are rubber, the wheels have shocks, his head has a moveable mouth button on the back of his head, and the weapons store in the trailer. Travel back 20 years and remember the original Optimus - it was never this cool!"

5,Best science fiction I've read since Orson Scott Card,"Great characters and geography. Larke has a talent for coining evocative words (""dunmagic""), for making religion intelligible, and for depicting the habits of rational birds--who play an increasing role in this novel. Her earlier novel Havenstar, in a different series, is even better."
4,good for action adventure fans,"This was definitely a fun read, like stepping into an action adventure film. She has great world building skills, and draws you in with fascinating details. At times, the narrative was choppy and I wished she would slow down, so we can savor the moment and draw out the suspense. But overall, I liked the book."
5,Fantastic,"Enjoyed this book immensely and re-read it several times more. Larke can definitely write a good novel with exciting twist and action. I love how 'strong' the main character is. Blaze is extremely sexy on the cover which is just a plus, lolFantastic plot and the characters are well built."
4,Great Book.,"Finally, a book with depth that I am not totally confused reading. On one level, the story is pretty basic but solid, great ideas. On the next the author adds prespective by saying it is written by a man who is interviewing the main character when she is around 80. We get a prespective from the man from the future and we have multiple story lines without the twenty different names that you have to go back and figure out who the heck they are talking about. Definitely going to read the rest."
1,FAKE,"These are FAKE riedel glasses. They are chunky. They say ""JR"" at the bottom of the glass not the usual Riedel logo. I have the real riedel champagne glasses and these are obviously not them. And they showed up 3 days late. They are going back."
5,What a Killer Album!,"I simply can't believe that almost nobody has ever heard of this effort by the Gales Brothers. I have some of Eric's and some of Jimmy's music but had never heard of this one. Didn't even know there were more Gales who played guitar. This is a really solid rockin' blues album from start to finish and I can't see anyone being disappointed in it. These type albums with multiple family members are sometimes not what you'd hope for, but this one is a winner."
5,Add it to turkey burgers!,"Besides the excellent salad dressing you can mix up, controling the type and amount of oil used -- this is an excellent add-in for turkey burgers, giving them a richer flavor.Good Seasons is a tried-and-true product that's been around for years. If you've never used it, you'll be amazed at it's wonderful flavor and the versatility of uses that can make lots of foods extra-special."
5,Good Dressing,"I am currently living in Hungary and I have yet to find Italian dressing in a store. There may be specialty stores that import it, but then it would cost an arm and a leg. Shipping stuff here from the US is also prohibitively expensive and so mix packets are the best way to go. When I have friends coming out, they can pack it in a suit case without killing their weight allowance.The family loves it and I enjoy having a little control over exactly how the dressing will taste by being able to make changes in type of vinegar. It's very good and the whole family likes it."
3,Algebraists? A Math degree will not make this better.,"The concept of entities which live in gas giants and can teleport between them was first introduced to me in Kevin Anderson's Saga of the Seven Suns. At the time, I was blown away by this intriguing concept; but, the focus of the series was not specifically on these Gas Giant Dwellers. The Algebraist does focus on them and takes it to a whole new level. Unfortunately, there were a number of factors which kept me from really enjoying this stand alone novel. The pace of the novel is slow - every hundred pages required fresh resolve for me to continue. The ominous threat to the protagonist never materializes although there was significant character development there. I could not tell if the protagonist's loyaties were misplaced, ambiguous or anathema to him. This novel was a lot of work for a pay off that feels a bit like you arrived at a great party just after the cops sent everyone home."
2,A large book with no substance,This was the first book I have read by this author and this is the first review I have written on any book. I suffered through most of this book though some of it was tolerable. The author rambles through many passages. This story could have been told in a hundred pages. I do not see how this book was considered for a Hugo. Spin won and The Algebraist is not nearly as well written nor is it in the same league with any Hugo winner that I can think of - and I have read most of 'em. Sorry to offend those that do like this story including someone( I doubt there could be many) at Amazon who thought this was a good book. I think I would have a hard time choosing another book by this author as my view of his writing is now tainted.
5,Splendid!,I borrowed this bbok from a friend. I liked it. I really don't know what else to say. Just buy it and read it!
4,Another great Banks book,"I love this author's SF. While I love the culture books I particularly enjoyed this one because it was set outside the culture. It had wonderful interesting plots and interesting new species and viewpoints. Bank's writing style always makes me feel immersed in the story and this book was no different. I don't believe this is his best work, but it was very good, and by any other author it would have been a masterpiece. I hope he keeps writing for many years to come."
4,Brilliant intro to Culture and Banks,"This book is a little lighter than the other Culture books to my mind. The writing is excellent, the story deep, the characters complex, as in all Banks books. The main difference is that this story unfolds faster than many of Banks's books and also this one has some truly humorous moments, as do many of his books, to the point you're left feeling light hearted and ""tickled pink"". A fun story though still hard SF and not a trivial book at all."
3,Disappointing,"I love many of Banks' other works, and this one really kicked into gear about 2/3rds of the way through. However (unusually for me) I figured out the main mystery of the novel early on, and the ending fell completely flat. A number of other threads that could have been interesting amounted to nothing. Try one of his other books instead."
3,My first and probably not my last Iain Banks' novel,"This was my first Iain Banks novel and maybe I should have read others of his first as other reviewers have suggested. But until page 300, I found reading slow going. I only continued because the writing was excellent and I know in order to create an alien world, a lot of exposition must be tolerated.I was rewarded for hanging with the story, the last 130 pages were as exciting as the first 300 were boring and I couldn't put the book down - I spent my new year's eve finishing the book (maybe I'm boring). I probably will read another Banks' novel to find out if his other novels are as good as the last part of this story."
4,Slow to start but worth the wait for space opera fans,"A distant future anthropologist whose studies inadvertently uncover the clues to saving his star system from invasion becomes wrapped up in the search for a miracle, encountering numerous alien cultures and social-political interests along the way. Although the book falters a bit in the early pages by establishing additional unecessary storylines, it eventually settles into a satisfying mix of action and humor, with some fairly original ideas about intelligent life in the universe and possible futures for human kind. Some great revelations throughout, with a truly evil nemesis in the Archimanderite Luseferous (what a name).Banks has a lighter, funnier tone with dialogue that others in the genre (Hamilton, Vinge, Reynolds) that may seem a bit to modern-day, but actually works quite well within the other far-distant future themes."
4,Surprisingly Good,"I found the Algebraist very hard to put down, with some very interesting twists at the end of the book."
2,Is it an opera because of how it drags?,"I'm not entirely sure what a space opera is supposed to be. If this book represents the ideal then I'll never read another one. The story was a combination of insteresting elements interwined with numbing plot lines which either went nowhere or left me completely unfulfilled. If this was intentionally part of a sequential interlinked series, then I could perhaps understand the way some of it was presented. I don't believe that's the case, though. I don't mind a slow build to a story, but this was like a series of slow builds, and some of them never finished building. I don't find myself inclined to read anymore by this author on the basis of this experience."
5,(Near) Perfect Space Opera,"This book is almost perfect. The writing is is crisp and descriptive. The story unique one for a (very) well-trodden field. The protagonist someone easy to identify with. The issue, finding the algebraic equation that unlocks a mystery held secret for 8 billion years, is very appealing.The ending ... well, the ending doesn't match the promise of the setup, I'm afraid. Too easy, too predictable ... unfortunate. However, the book still gets 5 stars from me on basis of everything else."
2,early promise never fulfilled,"Never had known his work prior to this book. He deserves credit for creating an interesting universe.But that is not enough for a novel. All the characters are too thin. The plots are set up nicely in the first half of the book. But the way each plotline gets resolved is dismal to say the least. Essentially, each problem is solved extremely quickly and suddenly in the very very end with no twist whatsoever by the emergence of totally superior 'saviours' of one form or another.The author's politics also got in the way. The 'dwellers', which the author clearly admires, are simply utopian hippies possessing unmatched technological knowhow. They play the part of the ancient-ominpotent-ominscience master who only dains to kick ass when everything else fails seen in many cliched KungFu movies.One gets the impression that the author was pressed for time to finish what he had started."
5,Great Read,I thought it was a page turner - it was very well written and would definitely recommend it to anyone.
5,"This is a GREAT Book...One you wont soon forget, if EVER!!","I read this in ""paperback"" about 20-25 years ago and I can still picture it ALL in my head.It is still so vivid I came here to do a search for it.Its one of those Books you will NEVER Forget.So now, I will buy it again and re read it... it is Well worth it"
5,lion witch & The Wardrobe,"I watched this movie when I was little. It got me interested in the book series. I loved them both. I now have a daughter and have passed along this great series to her. She would really like to see this movie. Please consider releasing it to the new generation. Harry Potter has kids hooked on magic, let them see Narnia. I am sure they will love it as much as we did back in the old days."
4,Lion In You're Heart,One of the best classic stories for children.Excelnt to have on DVD .Well worth the by.It's nice to watch the movie with familuer characters and exciting battels and adventures of sorts.
5,very very very entertaining,can someone please help me with a copy of the lion the witch and the wardrobe on vhs?
2,"Stupid, not a fine movie","Totally outragous!!!! Bad effects. It seems like they made the movie in the same area. The Witch is (dull,) Edmund did not look like himself. I like the new one more than this peice of junk."
2,People in animal suits?,"I love the Chronicles of Narnia and have read them many many times. I thought that a movie would be a great idea, and even though this version is truer to the story than the new Walden Media film, it looks cheap. It was a good idea produced when technology couldn't handle the necessities of the story. People in animal suits? Nice effort, but I was turned off by the bad attempts at acting and the even worse attempts at making it look realistic. Don't waste your money on the BBC. It's not worth it."
1,wrong item-sent back,I did not intend to order THIS item (silly me- wrong title). I sent it back. No results.
4,Re-Release!,I have been searching the Internet for a copy of this video. Nobody carries it. It is not even available in video stores to rent. I remember watching the animated film with my sister when I was little and I want so much to be able to see it again. Please consider re-releasing this classic film. I guarantee that I am not the only little child that used to think that a whole world existed inside her closet....
5,Please re release the video,This is one of the greatest childrens video ever! Mabe we should start a campaign to get the studio to re release it.
5,"Chronicles of Narnia - The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe","I give this 5 stars because its an amazingchildrens film, directed amazingly for a madefor TV movie and wonderful special effects for1988. The film/story is also the most superb ofthe trilogy. 4 english children travel to anotherworld to escape the real anxiety and fear of WW2and the nazi invasion. The white witch is hystericaland perfectly casted! Im 23 and I still love thismovie and I will never remove it from my DVD collection,yet I also recommend it highly safe and entertaining forkids. This is a film the whole family can enjoy. I alsoenjoyed the 3rd film ""the silver chair"" and rated it 4. Themiddle film wasnt as good, but you may want it cause itties into the other two films."
2,"Not the best version of ""The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe""","It followed the storyline very well, and the cast wasn't bad. However, it wasn't smart to make this movie at the time they made it. The 80's and early 90's didn't have the special effects that we have today. The scenery wasn't too good and the battle wasn't exciting at all. Also, it's not smart to have actors were animal costumes. It's too childish."
4,"Great Book, Good movie.","The lion, the witch and the wardrobe.A lovely book. When I read it I was surprised by C.S. Lewis and his series. The movie is also great. Like I expected. The old effects, I love them! Since I saw Godzilla's japanese movies I have been interested in old effects. It is perfect. But it is too but too long! By the way, I prefare the new version created by Disney. Thankyou Thankyou! Yep-Yep!"
5,wonderfull for children,"superbThis is a captivating and memorable dramatic tale which teaches basic good vs evil morality to small children in a way they remember and understand. Older children and adults can understand it more deeply and the story's ultimate message is profound. There is no superfluous violence, no excessive special effects or scenes unsuitable for children. This is not like the many Disney ""childrens"" movies which turn out to be PG rated. Why can't Hollywood make movies like this?"
3,A more faithful version,"I must admit, I fell asleep in my first viewing. It drags a lot especially when Mrs. Beaver is packing food. The mythic characters did not look that well on screen since they looked like giant mascots. Edmund is taller than Peter. Lucy is not as cute as the Lucy of the 2005 Disney Walden adaptation. Aslan's voice does not fit much. But still, I like this version because it is the version that has more soul in it. It is more faithful to book though it lacked the grandeur of it."
5,As close as it gets,"This film version of Lewis's classic tale remains very true to the book and is very well done. I do recommend that you read the book in order to truly appreciate the story. By the way,the music at the beginning is so beautiful that it makes me cry!"
4,"Charming, in a childlike way","This version is not everyone's cup of tea. But my 7 yo daughter loves it and so do I. It is very UnDisney. But it tells the story more in the way a child actually imagines things. And the script is excellent, especially the parts written for the White Witch and the Professor. On the other hand, if you and your kids are all about high-end special effects this BBC production will disappoint you (which is too bad, really.)"
3,Great Version of a Children's Classic,"I think that my favorite aspect of this version is the fact that the children look like actual children.This is a child's fantasy-adventure -- the recent version was so Hollywood that it was hard to tell that this was something coming from a child's imagination. Yeah - the beavers are adults in costume.How are children going to fit in a beaver dam unless they are beaver size (or vice versa)?The witch is more evil than Tilda Swinton (who, I thought, would have been more appropriate on a catwalk in Paris).Aslan is a bit hokey and most of the costumes are ridiculous but it was quite well done and I can see where kids would relate more to this than to the modern version.The actress who plays Lucy is chubby with a noticeable overbite -- she looks like a real kid, not some professional acting child. All in all, I think it is worth watching and look forward to the rest in the series."
2,"No grownups in beaver suits, please!","Hoping for a good visual treatment of Lewis' Narnia books, I ordered this tape. My kids and I were appalled by the adult actors in cheaply made animal costumes, as well as the creepy special effects for all the non-actor animals apart from Aslan (looks like all the $$$ went into Aslan).Now with all the great digital computer animation possible, will someone please redo this series, a la Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings?"
5,"Lion, witch and the wardrobe (animated version)","I would love to see this movie again, it is the absolutely best film ever. If anyone would know somewhere to find it I would be very greatefull for all help. Don't miss this one!lindeh@hotmail.com"
5,Wonderful and Magical,"I have all three of the Chronicles of Narnia video sets - The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe; Prince Caspian and The Voyage of the Dawn Treader; and The Silver Chair, having been given them as gifts at least 7 years ago. I am shocked that these are now currently not available, especially with the current Harry Potter craze. The Chronicles of Narnia are wonderful stories for children and adults alike and these British productions from the late 1980s of four of the seven C.S. Lewis books are wonderful and magical. I thought I recalled still seeing these in the PBS Video Catalogs from time to time - I could be mistaken though. Even though I already have these tapes, I hope they are re-released soon for others to enjoy!!!"
5,"Excellent video for children, but also for adults!","Though not strictly a video version of the famous C. S. Lewis book, this video captures it in an engaging form, while presenting the authors' views of the crucifixion and resurrection of Christ. It is a deeply moving portrayal of the struggle of good and evil, mixing four children from earth with various animals and mystical creatures playing the parts of Christ (Aslan, the ""Good and terrible lion"") and Satan (the White Witch). Lewis even succeeds in mixing the English character of ""Father Christmas"" into the story. A fantasy adventure with plenty of suspense and even a little intrigue: definitely a ""must see."" NOT just a religious film!"
5,"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","My parents and I really love this movie, but we don't know where to find it so that we can buy it. Somebody! Anybody! Help!"
1,Help me!,I have been searching for the Chronicles of Narnia in videos for some years. Now I found out that it is sold out! Can anybody help me?
4,Excellent,"I use these to splice wires on my dog's ""invisible"" fence. They work great, even sitting on the ground outside in the rain. They can be a little frustrating if you do not strip the wires to the correct length."
2,Smaller than I thought,"I was using these with outdoor lights. I was splicing into my main 12AWG line, with my light fixtures 18AWG lead. When trying to twist the two ends of the 12AWG and the one end of the 18AWG wire into the wire nut, the wires didn't fit.I just used larger standard wire nuts, and had a tube of silicon that I would fill them up with before twisting them on."
5,Great Spanish Reggae Album,"This is my first Luny Tunes album. This is real Reggaeton. I also have several other popular Reggaeton albums but this one is one of the best. This album is Spanish Reggae with some great Salsa influence. There are tons of songs with a variety of beats, not too much Rap or Hip Hop either! Plus you get a hot DVD. I highly recommend this album to anyone who loves Puerto Rican music and wants to hear real Spanish Reggaeton."
1,Yuck!,"I usually love NOW products use them for supplements all the time. I was disappointed with the stevia packets. The after taste was terrible--tasted bitter instead of sweet. I've been using stevia packets for years and never had a brand that tasted so horrible. I looked at the label and found that it had rice maltodextrin in it. So, I'm assuming that's the cause for the after taste. Read your labels before bying. Maltodextrin isn't the healthiest thing to put in your body either and chances are if you're using a stevia product, you're trying to stay away from white sugar and artificial sweeteners. So, buyer beware."
4,Very Good Sweetener,"This is the best stevia product that I've tasted so far; it's a wonderful alternative to sugar, which I'm trying to eliminate from my diet."
1,tastes like paper!,"I'm usually impressed with this brand's stevia products, but not with these individually packed ones. These don't taste sweet in the slightest; tastes more like paper! Also, the ones I got were packed in a white wrapper, not blue like the picture shows."
3,This Stevia Powder doesn't desolve well in cold liquids.,"The pure product while being much more stronger than sugar, is ""cut"" down in strength to that of sugar packet strength. The result does not desolve well in cold liquids. The has a more pronounced and unique flaver than sugar which enhances the taste to whatever you put it in.The NuNaturals stevia packets sold in Vitamin Stores desolves better but is 3 times more expensive."
1,NOW Foods Stevia Packets=yuk,"It doesn't melt in liquid, I have to use more to get the sweetness I like, DO NOT like Rice Maltodextrin in my Stevia and last but not least, each packet has 1 carb! I am returning my order to Amazon. I have been using Stevia for approximately 3 years and have tried different brands."
1,I ordered this and waited and waited,and then got a refund saying the company does not carry this item any longer... what a disappointment... take this listing off....
4,Great product.,I have a Dell 8100 and needed a replacement battery. It was shipped and received fast. Great product. Works perfectly!Thanks.
4,"Fantastic. Funny, and accurate","To start off...I skipped the first ten minutes or so of the movie. It's pretty much stupid MTV real-world like depictions.I recommend you do the same. Just skip forward to the part where he travels to asia.The most commendable thing about the movie is its realism. There is no embellishment: this is how asian people are and how asian streets look. The humor is light-hearted as well, but funny I found. I'm actually only half-way through right now, so I don't know how it ends, and frankly, I don't care. Enjoy."
1,TRADING ON HER PAST REPUTATION,"I picked up this book on an impulse, not having read anything by the author before, and therefore I did not have any pre-conceived idea of what I was going to find. As it turned out I was very disappointed, mainly because the writer is so self-indulgent. That's to say, she's written for her own satisfaction, and lost sight of the need to hold her readers' attention. She constantly tells us that this is a book about story-telling. Funnily enough, that's why people buy books. It's like the packs of frozen food you buy, which have a picture on the front captioned ""Serving Suggestion"" that shows the contents on a plate. Which is not a bad metaphor, since I note from other reviews that some of this book's contents has been regurgitated from previous offerings, and served up again."
3,light lit about lighthousekeeping,"this is a just ok book. the story line is very interesting and it is very well written. but it jumps around a lot and it is often not clear what is happening. this makes it hard to get the message, or at least all of the message, she writes about. if she had stuck to the main theme and developed the central character better, it might have been a first class novel. the back and forth and fussing with extraenous persons just clouds things up. dgs"
1,Boring - boring - boring!,"I am amazed at the rave reviews submitted so far. I just decided , twenty or so pages from the end, that the book is not worth finishing. Time and place seem confused for no purpose. In fact, the novel seems purposeless and pointless in general. I find Silver an uninteresting, under- developed character about whose ultimate fate I couldn't care less! I do, however, hope the author was kind to the lighthouse keeper. Maybe if I skip to the end??"
1,Psychopathic Literature,What has this world come to? Read 'The Ascendancy of the Scientific Dictatorship'. This is the ideology that created the Soviet and Nazi nightmares
3,Agape Leadership,"Robert Peterson and Alexander Strauch summarize the life and leadership of Pastor R.C. Chapman in Agape Leadership.More than anything, Agape Leadership puts flesh and bones on the elder qualifications set forth in 1 Timothy 3 and Titus 1. Peterson and Strauch cover the pertinent biographical information that one might expect. But the critical elements concern the leadership lessons that emerge from the life of R.C. Chapman.Chapman (1803-1902) is portrayed as a godly man. He was committed to the Word of God, prayer, evangelism, and the local church. His friend C.H. Spurgeon called him ""the saintliest man I ever knew.""R.C. Chapman's life reminds me of a church I visited in Belarus. I noticed a sign in Russian above the pulpit. I asked the pastor to translate. He responded with great humility, ""Ah, the sign says, 'We preached Christ crucified.'"" Chapman's passion was to do just this. His aim in life was to preach Christ crucified. May his tribe increase!"
2,Not Authentic,I have just purchased the Kindle addition. I was very disappointed to see the author took liberty with using a modern version. When Chapman quotes the Bible in the book the author has him quoting from a modern version that was not around then. A few times the King James Version was used. I do not think this should be done and is dishonest and none authentic.
1,Horrible version,"This is not a summarized version, it appears as if someone just tore pages out. For example chapter 5 starts out like this: ""other, just like an endless cycle."" What is like an endless cycle?? Since when should a chapter start mid sentence? This is not a summarized version but a very very very dumbed down version. Just avoid this version at all costs, it's not even worth the $5. What Sun Tzu did was great, what these people did is a shame."
1,Misleading...,"When I ordered this book, I was very excited...thrilled, even. When I opened my package to get the book out, I was sorely disappointed. This book is tiny, I mean absolutely TINY. The description should state that it is a mini book. Won't happen to me again."
3,Not what I was expecting...,"The book was not advertised as a ""Mini"" book. Like 3""x3"". I thought I was getting a regular book, and was disappointed. I didn't want to go through the hassel of returning, which was probably a factor that the seller banks on."
3,Good enough - But very small,"I didn't realize when I bought it, but this is a small format book, about 3"" square. It is a hardcover that fits in your pocket. I expected something a bit larger."
2,I paid for WHAT??,"A great book for my keychain. As a young Army Lt., one of my Corporals recommended it. I'm sure that he meant the larger many hundred page version. I'll try it, but doubt it will be of much use. This is where on-line shopping gets rather dicey:("
1,The Art of War for Lilliputians......,"I'm sure the text is fin, however wha I received was a 3"" x 3"" micro book that's all but unreadable. What's worse is there was no indication in it's listing that I could find that said it was a book for munchkins.Not happy."
1,this book is a waste of money,"You would be better to take your 5 dollars and put it in a paper shredder than to buy this book. This is the stuff that makes buying things online so untrusting. This book is about thee size of a dollar bill folded in half. The writing is small, and the contents seems to be the outline for the outline for the outline.If it was possible to rate negative stars i would have"
2,Good Book - Small Package,"I would have chosen a different book had I read any of the reviews prior to purchase. I have learned a lesson! This is a mini-book aprox 3""x3"". It's nice to carry around with you, but not an in depth text."
2,DOLL HOUSE SIZE BOOK--BEWARE,"THIS IS AN ITSY-BITSY, TINY WEENY BOOK!!!!! HARD TO HANDLE WITHVERY SMALL PRINT. GREAT TO TAKE ALONG ON A SPACE SHUTTLE IF WEIGHT AND SPACE ARE AT A PREMIUM. OTHERWISE A NOVELTY STOCKING STUFFER. I AM GOING TO HAVE TO REORDER THIS IN A PRACTICAL SIZE IN ORDER TO ACTUALLY READ IT."
1,WASTE!,What a waste. I wonder how many people wasted their time ordering something that wasn't as described?
1,are you kidding me,"VERY DECEPTIVE. Makes it seem like its a hardcover book, yet it fits in the palm of my hand. its 3inches by 3inches. That is just ridiculous. On top of the deception, the ""book"" was a TOTAL RIP OFF."
1,Simply shoddy,``Don't judge a book by its cover.'' They could have at least gotten the Chinese characters the right way round -- the text on the cover is flipped left-to-right. I would not express surprise if this were representative of the contents (translation.)I can't say I'm particularly impressed with this edition of an otherwise great classic. (Allegedly. I've yet to read it. :-/)
1,feel cheated,"This is my first time shopping in Amazon.com and I was really shocked when i see the size of the book. I never thought that's a micro book like this . IF the decription say pocket size or some other words , I would rethink before i buy. The only i can say when I open the package was "" Is that what we call BOOK ? "". Anyway , I leave this time as my carelessness but next time won't be easy."
1,ummm......yeah........What the heck did I buy?,"Others are really ticked off, I so astounded that this book was smaller than a pack of smokes that I can do nothing but laugh. This book is that pathetic........The ad was deceptive, the cover was on backward, and the cover was missing half of it's print..........just pathetic. Don't buy this!!!!!!!!"
2,Size Does Matter,"This book is smaller in size than a post-it note. That makes the typeset almost microscopic. Also, I expect that it is an abridged version.It would be nice if this were disclosed in the description."
2,The art of Was,"I was very surprised to recieve this book to find that it is the smallest book I have ever seen, my lighter is bigger than this book. While I like it, you need to realize that this book is about 3"" X 3"". So don't expect to recieve a regular sized book."
3,This book Is TINY,"A very small book with big impact. A joke gift for your coworkers, maybe. The book is, basically too small to seriously read."
3,A little small,"It was smaller than what I was expecting, but a good read and easily fits in your pants pocket"
1,Save your money !!!,"This is a TEENIE-WENNIE, LITTLE-BITTY book. It is an insult to the great work of the Chinese genius Sun Tzu."
2,Too Small,Alot of the important writings were left out of this book. It was a bad idea not to read the review before buying.
2,No wonder it was so cheap,"This is a tiny book (1"" by 1"") with an abridged version of the text. This was not evident from the description. It would be a good Christmas stocking stuffer but was not useful as a textbook."
2,Needs better clarification,"Sure, this is the renowned Art of War, but it needs clarification that this edition of it is a miniature book."
1,WARNING - THIS BOOK CAN FIT IN MY WALLET,"THIS BOOKS IS TINY. I bought the book and realized it was a small ""wallet edition."" ITS TINY. I had no problems returning it to amazon and they completely covered all the expenses very quickly. The service was great, but it should be clearly stated that this is not a full size book."
4,FANTASTIC DINNER PARTY MUSIC,"i'M NOT MUCH OF A JAZZ FAN BUT THIS CD IS JUST WONDERFUL--SORT OF DREAMY, SORT OF SASSY--WAS A HUGE HIT WITH MY FRIENDS THIS PAST WEEKEND"
4,Dance Back,"I must be getting old or bored with dance music. It's really hard to distinguish the difference between these 7 updated dance remixes of Stevie Nicks' Stand Back. They did try to preserve the original feel to the song without the dated electronical sound of the 80's. Instead it is the trendy electronical dance sound of the past 15 years.There is no radio edit of 4 or 5 minutes here. The first mix clocks in at 11:26. The short version is the 3rd track ""Tracy Takes Me Home Mixshadow"" mix-6:53. My favorite would have to be the 5th track ""Ralphi's Beefy Retro Mix"" -7:30. It's clear, direct and a little retro.This coincides with the release of Crystal Vison:The Best Of Stevie Nicks collection which includes the original version. After 70 minutes of remixes of the same song. I am tired...lol!"
4,Need To Have,"This is a great remix - the one that should have been done 15 years ago, and now finally has been. A must for all Stevie fans. I like version 3 & 5 best. I'm not sure if these are all new vocals ala ""Dreams"" or just re-mixed?? I think they're new vocals."
5,"Simple but ""unique,"" very appealing","Was in the market for wedding rings, but didn't want the traditional simple band. Looked in SO many jewelry stores for something a little more unique, and decided we would need to custom-order something. On a whim my wife-to-be found this style on-line, and we have been very happy with it. And together they cost only a fraction of what more traditional wedding bands would have cost.The company, while a little difficult to reach via phone, was very good about delivering when promised.The rings themselves have been a very satisfying purchase. While the open design lends itself to trapping of substances (bits of soap when washing hands, or rarely a hair gets caught), this has not been a persistent problem and the rings have stood up well to wear-and-tear (so far). Too bad they are not available in more traditional metals."
3,Photo is larger than actual ring is.,"I am a bit disappointed with this product, but please take this review with a grain of salt. I had a similar ring I wore on my thumb for 15 years, and then it was lost while working. So I was searching to replace it. This ring's photo looks exactly like my ring. I was so excited, because I was missing this part of me that was just gone after 15 years. There are no specs to know the width, but the photo size looks just a little larger than my actual ring size, so I got this ring. This ring is beautiful, and simple and elegant. My problem is it just doesn't look as substantial as it's photo. I expected it to be wider, almost twice as wide as it is. I expected the wires to be thicker, I guess I just expected more. This ring is dainty compared to what I expected, so I rated it 3 stars, as it's okay. I do wear it, and would even say like it."
2,not what I ordered,I purchased two rings expecting them to be identical but they weren't. One was smaller in width than the other. Shipping was not fast it took a week just to receive them in the mail. Have to say I was dissatisfied with the result.
2,Not as described,"The product works great for my NES/SNES so if you're buying it for those, great. But I was buying it for use with my Genesis, I already had power cords for the other two. It doesn't fit a model 2 Genesis (which uses the same plug as model 3). I imagine it probably would fit a model 1 but I don't have one of those. If you only fir one of the three types of a system, you should really specify that, I just assumed since its a multi plug it would have a plug for each kind. Not the case. It has two plugs, one of which fits the SNES and one of which fits the NES but nothing for the Genesis. Very annoying."
5,Great power cord,This power cord gets the job done for 3 systems and weighs about a half a pound. I prefer this power cord over the old power cords for the nes/snes/genesis because this one is very light and not to long so you can manage the cord and not get it tangled.
1,Dont Buy,Horrible.. Do Not Buy. Its a waste of money. Leaves lines threw the T.V and heats up really fast. Its dangerous.
2,Bad soldering job,"I guess you get what you pay for. The primary power leads were not soldered on properly so I had to unscrew the box and resolder the power cord. For $5 I guess you get to be a little ""hands on"""
2,Doesn't Work for Genesis,"The product works for SNES, but does not work for my SEGA genesis as written in the description. Really disappointed."
4,Lego Hotel,"I bought this for my son so that he would have a big project to build. He has thoroughly enjoyed putting the hotel together, and cannot wait to move on to his next project."
5,Great for kids who love Legos,"My 6yrs old son loved this. However, when I thought it would be days and days of fun, he did finish it in a couple of days."
5,Worth it!,"Bought this set to add my collection. Paid a pretty penny for it, but well worth it. There are only a couple of ""corner"" buildings for the modular series and this one is a focal point. Priced well over what it sold for new, but a ""must have"" for the serious collector."
2,Is it Really worth?,"I purchased this book in Amazon with lot of hope to get a outsider's view on the CISA. Unfortunately there is no consistency in the chapters and I am afraid to what extent this is going to help me in preparing for the CISA. Now I have to buy some more materials before taking the test. The CD is totally absurd with wrong answers. The explanatory answers points to option 'D' while the answer is marked as Option 'C'. Unless the author comes with a revised version early, this book is not going to be helpful for CISA Preparation."
1,Obtuse and perhaps worthless,"Why use 1 word when 12 will bewilder the reader and make the book that much thicker. I can not believe that a qualified editor reviewed this book.The wheat to chaff ratio is horrendous. You can go whole paragraphs without coming upon anything worth knowing.I can only hope that the actual CISA exam questions are not written as poorly as the sample questions within this book.If you value your time, do not buy this book."
2,"Overpriced, misaligned, bloated + boring = 2 stars","I gave this book 2 stars because it's overpriced, misaligned, bloated and quite boring. Lots of time, Kramer used 200 words to explain something when 50 would have been enough. There's alot of minor errors + many cases where the author is completely wrong. The content covers CISA's material but it simply does not match with CISA's domains. If I had to throw a stone to someone, that would be to the editor cos that guy simply did not do his job. There's way too many content errors, spelling mistakes and ambiguous sentences.To wrap thing up, it's a subpar book with an hefty price tag. I would NOT recommand it to anyone taking an ISACA exam. Your $$$ would be better spent buying the official CRM 2006."
4,Pretty good but not great,A really good album in general but kind of uneven. Along with great songs like Asche zu Asche or Der Meister there are others that didn't mean anything to me.
5,Ramms+ein ist SEHR gut!,"Ich liebe rammstein, sie spielen sehr gut musik. ich mochte ihr im conzert sehen. Magst du rammstein? Wenn nein, BUECK DICH!"
5,"Rammstein it's not for you sucker,go listen disco music","The BEST of the BEST .This is the music of the future like :Korn,Manrilyn Manson...and many others.Youy don't have to understand (sometimes).All you have to do is to feel the music .This kind of music make me feel strong,powerfull and I can express myself better. one more thing this kind of music it's not for SUCKER"
5,This is an excellent CD,"Herzleid is one of the best CD purchases I have ever made in my life!Some of the best songs on this CD are about showing the darker sides of humanity. Examples are 'Heirate Mich' (Marry Me) about a necrophilliac, 'Du Riechst So Gut' (You Smell So Good) about animal lust, 'Weisses Fleish' (White Flesh) about a child killer, and for fun 'Laichzeit' (Spawntime).'Das Alte Leid'(The Old Pain) and 'Asche zu Asche'(Ashes to Ashes) are also good, hard tracks, and I enjoy annoying my Fundie neighbors with them.I have had this CD for seven months, and I still play it like I bought it yesterday. If you're still ancy about the german, there are lots of websites if you're curious to what they're playing about."
4,"Good stuff, but not as good as Sehnsucht","The christians need to leave us alone. Otherwise, I'm going to organize a picket line at the next jars of Clay concert."
5,RAMMSTEIN ...DEUTSCH MUSIK IST ZU GUT!,"Deutsch musik auf Rammstein ist Das Beste der Weltund ich glaube das Rammstein sind sehr guten in allem machen sie, ihr Konzerte sind die besten und hier in Mexiko, wir hoffen, sie wieder zu haben, aber allein ohne Kiss.Ich liebe Rammstein und ihr musik"
5,Herzeleid rocks 10 fold; even greater then Sehnsucht.,"This CD combines heavy motor guitar rock with a fast pace beat. If you like guitar rock and don't care about lyrics (because they're in German) this is the CD for you. This CD is good for any rock fan because it combines many types of rock: slow, heavy metal, and some pop aspects. I would give it 5+ stars if there was such a thing."
1,Shows Germany is only good for beer.,"Picture this. Take Depeche Mode, make them talk like mad germans and give them some Flying V's and what have you got? Does it sound good to you. Not me. If you want to satisfy your German tendencies, why don't you watch Rocky IV, or whichever one has that real German dude, Ivan, or pick up an old Metallica CD. That's where the hardcore is. Who says that? T Murder."
5,Better than Sehnsucht,This CD is better than Sehnsucht in my opinion. It's a lot heavier and has some of the best guitar riffs. The guitar solo in Weisses Fleisch kicks ***. Seemann is a real departure from all the other songs but it still rocks. If you've never seen Rammstein in concert. YOU MUST SEE THEM. They put on the best live shows. I can't wait for live aus berlin to come out.
5,Virtuous Dampfhammer-Metal,"...and we thought after ""Neue Deutsche Welle"" (Falco/Kraftwerk/Nena...) in the early 80s Germany's music scene had come to a standstill. Boy were we wrong!We never heard this kind of music played so exactly before. Everything crisp and clear.Funny though to listen to East-Germans pronouncing the ""r"" with a South-German/Austrian accent."
5,Rammstein,"I wish i had more star choices to rate this CD. Rammstein is the best band ever, and not only in Germany but all around the globe, from the North pole to the South. When i first heard them it was like 5 years ago, but anyway, i am not gonna say anything about that time because i feel a little nostalgic when i talk about Europe, goddamn continent how much i miss it. Anyway, who hasn't heard Rammstein, give it a try guys and girls, i assure you, they're the best. In the beginning when i heard DU HAST, i hated the keyboard coz it reminded me a little of European Techno music, but ask me now what i think of it:) Flake is a god in what he does. Hail to RAMMSTEIN people."
3,so bad they're good,"Hey everyone, try translating the songs into English. You might notice just how stupid the lyrics are. The only reason I listen to them is because they're so bad that they're amusing. However if you should ever have an opportunity to see them in concert, GO!! Not only are the effects and *real* drums great, you can even see just how serious Rammstein take themselves (not very). I still recommend this CD , but it's not worth five stars."
3,"Ramms+ein rocks, but they need to ditch the techno","Ramms+ein is my fave band, but they need to ditch the techno!! Du Hust is the best song, but its on the worst album. If you want Du Hust, buy Sensucht, but this one rules!"
5,Correction,"Best rammstein CD hands down. Mutter and sehnsuct are 4.5 stars each but herzeleid takes the cake. And i just had to correct Maarz's review.In das alte leid he says ""ich will ficken, then in the background, they sing niemehr."" translation- ""I want to F@<+ nomore"" Oh but if your new to rammstein this CD is a must. And dont wais your time with Amerika it was a huge let down. The lyrics are just, so unlike Tiel they should have changed their name for this CD. Mein Teil is the only good song"
3,Ach! Nicht so gut!!!,"I began listening to Rammstein when Reise, Reise was released. I was so impressed that I bought both Mutter, and Sehnsucht because I loved the band so much it made me sick. Then, recently, after hearing Herzeleid for the first time, I realized how much Rammstein has progressed since that time. This album, with the exception of Hereite Mich and Rammstein, is sub par and lacks the essential combination of neu Rock sound with heartfelt lyrics. Rammstein is my favorite band, but I can't seem to find anything breathtaking in this particular album."
5,"Excellent cd, but if it was in english it would suck","Parents and people with close minds hear Rammstein, and think its nothing but swearing in German. Kids love it because parents dont know what it is, and it sounds so brutual. The music on the cd is amazing, the singer is amazing. The words sound cool, but in english-Rammstein would the wussiest metal band around. Most lyrics are very cheesey, and makes you wonder why does he sound so mad when he is singing about something like that? Rammstein is better off in German, if it was English-the cd would be the funniest non comedy cd ever."
1,Too bad there's not a zero star rating,"It's a shame that Jon Goodman didn't hire someone else to write about his father, one of my favorite musical artists of all time. This shameless 256-page snoozer focuses more on the author than the subject at hand, the talented and skilled novelty king.I currentlly use the book to prop open the door to my bathroom. If the writing was of a better quality, it may be suitable to hold open a better door, such as the door to my front porch. This, however, is not the case.The arrogance of the son of the legend is apparent from the preface where he talks about himself on this very Web site. It is of no interest that Jon is a former police officer, but I am quite glad that he has pursued other lines of work--writing just isn't going to work out for him.Also, reviewer ""STEVEN K"" is Jon Goodman, the author"
5,I had no idea how entertaining this book would be!,"Having grown up in the 70's you could not turn on the radio without hearing Mr. Jaws or another one of Dickie Goodmans golden,Hysterical hits. But no one ever knew the man behind the magic. And what a life he led. Hi son Jon does an incredible job showing us all the different sides of the complex,funny and ultimately tragic character. You can tell by reading it that the author must have had a difficult time bringing up all of those memories. But thats what makes it such a great book. We can only hope that one day someone with the correct insight turns this in to a film so the whole world can see how such a small contribution to the music world has had such a everlasting affect on the industry as a whole. I highly reccomend this book to anyone even slightly interested in the history of music."
5,"Trigosamine Jointcare Supplement, Maximum Strength Caplets","My doctor has recommended this product to me. I have serious pain in my joints due to arthritis, as so many people do, but it is getting worse and I need some help. She recommends it highly. I have not received this product yet, but when it arrives, I will start taking it and pray that it works as well as my doctor says it will. Thanks."
2,Falls Short,"I have severe osteoarthritis and degenerative disc disease and was looking for a product that would offer daily relief from my pain - and this one is not it. The pills are huge, with the manufacture not offering all ingredients found in their formula or proper dosage requirements (this should have been an indicator when I purchased the product). I found an independent research group that did a study (and article) on this product, and they found that those that want to `prevent' joint damage, and not that desire pain relief, should take this product. I've just ordered `Flexcin', as it is intended for those that currently suffer from the pain of arthritis, has wonderful clinical reviews and is moderately priced. I plan to review this product after a month of use."
4,Good product,I have purchased this product before. It seems to be helpful. Good pricing did influence my purchase of this product.
4,Great Relief,"As a 77 year-old female, I started to experience knee aches. I had been regularly taking glucosamine, but when I changed over to trigosamine, I immediately got relief and hasn't had an ache since. I am very grateful. As a bonus, purchasing from Amazon gave me a little break from the ordinarily high price."
4,joint pain relief,"This product works rather well, but not sure that the price is worth it, since lower priced brands seems to work just as well"
3,Not bad,"Not a bad product, but I think it's over priced. I didn't notice a drastic difference between this and any other joint supplement that I've taken in the past."
4,Trigosamine Maxium strength,I bought these for my mother because she was in so much pain due to arthiritis. I can not be a good judge because she is taking them. But from what she is telling me they seem to work. I started with the fast acting first and she got better in 3 days like they say. Then I switched to these maximums. We both seem to think they work or at least help her from so much pain. I think they work thats why I still have been buying them for 4 months.
4,Good ingredients but there is better available,"Glucosamine Chondroitin and HA (and MSM) are all good for cartilage maintenance but those alone aren't going to give a lot of people the pain relief they are seeking. Liquid FlexEasy (flexeasy.com) has all the previous in addition to natural Cox 2 and 5 LO pain enzyme fighters Circumin, Boswellia, Acacia Extract, Bromelain, Chinese Skullcap in an easy to take one ounce liquid dose. It is affordable and you actually get product answers from the creator via email or phone."
2,Disappointing,Didn't get the results advertised. Just didn't work for me. I was hoping for more mobility after a month - it didn't happen
1,Item never received,"Trigosamine Jointcare Supplement, Maximum Strength Caplets, 90-Count BottleSent to my mother in November - never received. I find it impossible to determine how to write Amazon Customer Service for assistance."
3,oversize pkg,"bottle toolg. , less then half of bottle had pills. no. was accurate. add. stated free shipping , but I was chg'd."
3,Trigosamine,"Sorry,Have only been taking this product for about 3 weeks,and I believe it is too soon to review."
2,ARTHRITIC RELIEF,iT IS TOO EARLY TO TELL IF THE IDENTIFIED SUPPLEMENT WILL HELP DIMINISH JOINT PAIN AND/OR ARTHRITIS IN FINGERS.
2,Good product,"I ordered this product through Amazon mainly because I was told it is a good product and Amazon is my major source for online ordering. Anyway, I ordered it and it came within a few days which is Amazon's M.O. Anyway, the product is ok nothing like I thought it would be. I do have cartalige issues and take gloucosamine for my joints so, I know about various products on the market. This one is good but there are better ones out there. You have to take 3 or these at a time but the good thing is that they are capsules not big horse pills. I have not ordered them since I ran out. Good product overall. YMMV.NEOSOUL06."
5,Trigosamine,Within 2 weeks of using medication my husband is able to make a fist with his hand. Due to arthritis he could not close his hand to hold a golf club and now can return to golf.
1,Scam company--won't refund your money,"The product ingredients for this product are fairly common and several have been known to help. This particular combination is not that effective and pricey for what you get.However the REAL reason not to order from this company is their HORRIBLE customer service. They would not refund the money, the rep was very difficult to deal with and if you have an issue there is no way they will let you speak to a supervisor to try to resolve it.There is NO reason to support a company like this. I am very versed in products of this kind. Give your money to companies with more integrity who care about their customers.If you haven't tried them, I recommend The ARthri Zen cream or pills. Better products and a company that understands what customer service is."
1,You're Better Off Reading Inspirational Quotes On The Internet.,"Apparently you don't need to mention (or even read!) Plato's 30 page dialogue, Laches, to write a book on courage anymore. Check the index if you don't believe me. Plato's analysis of courage is prim and relevant to our contemporary understanding of courage. It would make sense that he wouldn't include the wisdom of one of worlds greatest thinkers in that it would undermine Lee's entire analysis. Although he mentions Aristotle a total of five times, Lee's use of his philosophy is completely misunderstood and taken from its context. To put it simply, this is a bad self-help book. You're better off reading inspirational quotes on the internet, seriously, my friends."
5,Masterful performance,"Michael Coleman's influence on the world of traditional Irish music was, and still is, enormous. His albums came out just as music was finally made portable, and were incredibly popular in Ireland. Each village would have perhaps one phonograph, at which everyone in the town would gather when a new Coleman record was released.And don't think that this music is dated, despite the fact that it will be a century old before long. The tone of Coleman's fiddle is something that's never been duplicated. His playing so fiery, so perfect. He was truly a master of his instrument. Any fan of the traditional music should own this CD."
4,Gods and Androids,I found the book to be a quality addition to my library. This replaces some of thr paperbacks that I have read until they were coming apart
5,"Inspiring, full of joy and love","I enjoyed watching this film with my friends and family. We were so inspired with Philip Neri's joy and purity of heart. After the movie, we couldn't stop singing the ""I prefer heaven"" song."
2,Not for actual use...,"The first time I needed to use an item from this kit it let me down. I had a slow leak in a tire, and discovered it while hundreds of miles from home. This kit has an air compressor -- no problem right? Well the part that clamps on to the valve stem broke off in my hand before I even had the compressor out of my trunk. I've since replaced many of the components of this kit with separately purchased items. I'd have been better off just using the description of the kit as a packing list to build my own."
5,Excellent Value for the Money,"A great value for the money. Comes with everything mentioned in the description above and is contained quite nicely and conveniently in the double sided/zippered bag. The contents are arranged nicely inside. The only thing it didn't come with was a glass breaking/seat belt cutting tool. The next AAA kit up comes with one, but you can get the tool cheaper than paying the price it costs to upgrade the kit.I bought two of these; one for my car and one for my husbands. Actually, he cut his finger pretty bad the other day so we got in the first aid part of the kit and used a band-aid!!"
4,Safety is not a second thought!!!,"My daughter graduated from college and turned 24 all in the same day. We had to drive from Philadelphia to Ohio and then back again for graduation and birthday celebrations. My daughter was not thinking of what might go wrong on her special day, but I was.The product came on time in great condition and it gave us all piece of mind for the trip."
5,Excellent compact kit,I saw this item as a deal of the day and I'm glad I grabbed it. Everything you might need for routine road problems.
5,Good for the Money,This product is good for the amount of money that I spent on it. The quality of the manufacturing is excellent.
3,Missing a valuable tool,I was surprised that a very important tool is missing. To complete the need for emergency tools I purchased separatelt a tite pressure gage. The built in one on the air compressor is totally tnadequate
5,Have tools will Travel,"A perfect gift for the novice driver with recent purchase of car in need of emergency kit you will always need if you don't have it, and probably never need it when you do have it, naturally!"
4,Beautiful,"These cards are truly beautiful. They were a little pricey - but are very colorful - on the inside and out of each card. They are printed on heavy, quality stock - and are a good assortment of Birthday, sympathy, thinking of you, etc. Very nice!"
3,Los elefantes encuentran mandragoras,"This is a post-mortem edition and almost the only book of this author that's easy to find. Even though it's always interesting to read her books, this one in particular seems to be untidy, not all so well written. Sickness, medicines, the novel refers to the life of an old lady full of memories and sometimes it turns to be difficult to follow the plot. A novel that's not as good as her short stories."
3,Excellent sound quality but CD has a flaw...,"Just got my copy of the Melba Moore ""This Is It"" reissue, and while it is great to have this album on CD in otherwise excellent sound quality, unfortunately SONY seems to have made an error with the 12 inch version of the title track... the first few bars are cut off and the song starts a few seconds late... hope this can be corrected."
3,Melba + Van McCoy = Hit,"So glad this has finally come out on cd. I have to admit I was disappointed w/ 12"" version of ""This Is It"" (it's cut off at the beginning)."
3,Thanks but......,"I was waiting for this cd and IT IS HERE, GREAT, but, Her greatest hit(at least in Mexico)the 12 "" version of THIS IS IT, has a mistake, the begining of the song is not on the cd, starts later, and I don't know where do they took it ? because I have a better version of this song, and lasts 5 minutes 23 seconds."
3,Lacking in Detail for People Who Know Better,"This tiny book is not worth all of the money charged for it. The recipes are not detailed enough. There are many spices that are not difficult to find that could have enhanced the flavor of many dishes. It seemed to me that this is a cookbook for the cook that is in a hurry. It`s great that there are different language translations, the illustrations are beautiful, but in trying to squeeze to recipes on one page, there is a great deal of detail sacrificed with the resulting food paying for it, but I suppose they are great for those who don`t know Haitian food."
3,Some Brief Nudity,"There's a couple scenes where a guy is watching a stripper type lady change her clothes in a window. She looks very nice and natural, a quality you don't always see with modern movies. The start of the film takes off her shirt once, but her room mate interrupts when he barges in... ""I'm sorry, I thought this was my room"" I wonder if that line would really work...."
3,Elmos travel DVD,"It was simple and cute but I wish they would have shown them at the zoo, my 3 yr. old kept asking."
3,Elmo's travel songs and games review,"I have a 17 month old that LOVES ELMO! So, I thought this video would be perfect. Unfortunately, there is too much talking and not enough singing for her to enjoy it 100%."
4,Good way to spend some time!,This is a good DVD to put in when you have a long drive and some cranky kiddos. They love singing the songs and watching their Sesame Street friends on DVD
5,cute video,Another cute video with some really catchy songs. Great for traveling. My 5 and 3 year old enjoy it and my husband and I don't mind listening to it either

5,"""Jump"" On This Book!","Philippe Halsman's Jump Book is not just for people who love photography. Oh no - no matter who you are, what your age, sex or nationality is, you will love this book. It has everything, from actors to politicians to artists and even royalty - up in the air!Each person has his own way of jumping. One hides her legs in her skirt, the other bends them and yet a third person will kick them as high as possible. I think each person's jump tells us a little bit about who he or she is, really. Each jump also has its own setting -some are indoors and some are outdoors, each person picking the place they want to be photographed at.The book is divided into sections, which makes it easy to compare people's jumps with their peers'.This is for the open-minded, as it is not your regular ""straight"" photography.If you're interested in more convetional pictures, I recommend Halsman's Portrait book, which is also beautiful."
3,"Great Story, But Im Getting Tired of The Shakey Camera","ramsey, with her background in photography, falls into a ever-growing trend in independent cinema. Ratcatcher comes complete with shakey steady cam shots, ultra-photograhic framing and dis-jointed editing. The effect these have is ultimately gorgeous, however these techniques are beginning to be, for me at least, a tad bit played out. They do less to service the story and do more to glorify the director and D.P. The story is handled well: she lets it develope slowly, and she doesnt force any moments on the viewer. All in all this is a great stroy and a beautifully shot film, but doesnt really push any visual boundries like some would like to believe."
3,I was hoping for more...,"This is a book written as an introductory text, and thus, it contains many words in bold. If you are looking for more than bold words like ""Home page"", ""Frame"", ""Icon"", or ""Applet"", then you may wish to consider a different text.Most importantly, the examples of good site design given by this text are bad... which makes it hard to take some of its design principles seriously. This book is for those who want to talk about web design, not do it.This book does provide a good start for someone totally new to the ""I-way"" (It hurts me to type that...) as it dose deal with the basics. However, I just couldn't help but feel that most of the text was giving new, bold names (I'm talking typeface here), to concepts with which most are already familiar."
5,"A ""Must Read""","I wish I would have known about this book before I moved to the USA! It answered a whole bunch of questions I had, relative to taxes and estate planning. If you are planning or contemplating a move to the USA, read this book BEFORE you move. You can save yourself a lot of money in taxes and a lot of frustration."
4,Eye opener for all Canadians moving US - author should remove sales pitch,"Yes, it's great book. Very valuable information. Must have for all Canadians planning to move to US.The author should NOT put sales pitch. It's damaging this great book."
3,No where to write on,This growth chart is darling and has places for pictures but there is no where to write the child's height on.
5,Wonderful Growth chart,"Awesome growth chart, it is cute and fun, makes a great wall hanging with pictures. This will be wonderful when my granddaughter is big enough to use. As always shopping was easy delivery was amazingly quick, which I just love. would make any child happy to see this hanging on their wall."
5,A must read,"My copy of this book has so many dog-eared pages and so much highlighter on it that I need to buy a new one so I can read it for the umptheenth time. If you want to understand yourself, your spouse, the dynamics of your relationship, what went wrong, and why you are behaving like you are, this is the only book to read. As other reviewers have noted, it is not a self-help book, just factual, but you can not read it without gaining eye opening insight. You will understand what happened and why, and that in itself is ""self-help"". I bought dozens of books on relationships and divorce, and then I found this one and didn't need any of the others."
3,As Far as Soundtracks Go...,"Not a bad buy. Nearer My God To Thee is especially well done in a non-traditional style. For the price I paid, I could have expected a lot less."
4,Black and white B Sci Fi fans rejoice.,"Ah the magic of those cheap black and white Science Fiction movies ground out in the 50s and 60s.Tom Weaver is the absolute master of interviewing the people involved: part adoring fan, part ""and now for the rest of the story"" reporting."
3,It's OK,"Pretty much the same as all her books. Nice reading in a somewhat straight vanilla erotic vein. I like the fact the husbands are, willy-nilly, faithful to their spouses. I now have about eight of her books so it is clear that something appeals to me."
1,Siezed my cash,"What a waste of paper. How dare someone write such trash, and pawn it off as a novel. This story is so completely stupid, I am embarrassed for the author. I was fooled by some of the other reviews. I am embarrassed for those reviewers as well. How could anyone read this book. The author seriously needs some psychological help. The book contains foul action after foul action. I was hoping for a little bit of a story. Erotica can be tasteful. As a matter of fact, the more tasteful it is the more able the reader is to relate to the actions. This was purely in poor taste. Don't waste your money on this one."
2,Seized,"This novel is surprisingly short for the price. It's only 160 pages and it's not small type. This novel is a sequel to The Empress' New Clothes and can't really be read without it. Certain parts of that novel are repeated in this one. I liked Geris and Dak. I wish that their romance had a greater part in this novel. For some reason, the author chose to put in segments about other characters who I can only assume will be featured in other novels. During these times, the main characters are not even mentioned.Also, if you're in favor of complete monogamy from your characters as I am, this isn't the book for you. I found the love scenes to be rather more a description of sex than love making. I didn't find it to be nearly sensual or stimulating enough. And here again, I don't think the main couple was focused on enough. I can only recall one love scene that was properly described between the two of them."
1,I Wonder Why She Wrote a Story Featuring a Black Heroine,"This story clearly shows that Ms. Black has a very low opinion of African-American women. I've purchased all the books in this series and I can say that she doesn't treat any of her white characters as badly as she treats Geris Jackson. I'm disappointed in Ms. Black and I'm sorry I purchased this book. I don't understand her need to see Geris humiliated and mistreated so many times by so many beings, even the High Priestess wanted to mistreat her suggesting that Geris be used as a dartboard. None of the other women were treated in such a manner, not even the women that belonged to warriors. I find it strange that a woman who was a member of the royal family could be treated in such a manner. All I have to say to this author is if you don't like a certain race of people you shouldn't include them in your book. In other words your hatred shouldn't be on display for the whole world to see."
3,Bizarre,"Wow this is a really bizarre read. If you like bizarre then you might like this one. You have spotted aliens with faces that resemble a butt and they have eyes on each cheek. Gross! They lick women with their long tongues, bringing them to climax. You have one foot tall handsome but stupid human like creatures that live on women's essence. If a women stumbles upon them, they are tackled, clothes ripped off and sucked upon, if not all night, then for hours. Also, the heroine's BF who is bonded to another Trek Mi Q'an warrior gets pregnate and doesn't really know it. Her gestation period is 3 weeks and when the time came she expelled blue junk, hatched an egg and out popped twins. A bit crazy. I keep reading out of pure curiosity. However, this was so not my cup of tea. I love sci-fi erotic type books but this was a bit too much."
3,Not bad but could of been better,I eagerly awaited the arrival of this book since Ms. Black's first book was so good. But I was a bit disappointed with this one. Geris Jackson the main female character was a bit much. However Dak the main male character was to die for. The plot was a little weaker than the first book as well. Hopefully the next book in the series will be better.
1,His first release is perchance his best...,"...but it's still crap! E-type has done exactly the same music since this debut-album, and none of the songs actually ""differs"" from eachother. Euro-dance isn't the most dynamic genre, which I hope the majority of us are aware of..... Exterminate it!"
5,Simply awesome,"If you are looking for some origanal euro-dance/techno music, this is a must have album. I bought this album in 1996 and it has been one of favorites ever since. Unfortunately, E Type has not been able to repeat his debut success in his next albums, releasing only a few hit singles that are worth listening to. I like every song on ""Made in Sweden"" with the exception of ""Me No Want Myseria"". Highly recommend to eurodance fans!"
1,Incorrect switch for the car I ordered it for.,"I had ordered a stop light switch for a 1970 Mustang and this one was not even the correct type of switch! I only found out after ordering it what it was supposed to look like and the stop light switch (or brake light switch as many refer to them as) for a 1970 Mustang is a completely different design than what they show.... and sent, unfortunately. Now I know!"
1,Misleading & Broken,"First off, the used VHS tape was cracked on the plastic VHS flip protector and unable to viewed or inserted into a player.Second - 1994 Saints is actually 1993 Saints released in 1994. The title should be 1993 Saints since it covers the 1993 season. I was interested in the 1994 season."
2,way too narrow,"I usually wear Pliner, Weitzman, Cole Haan. This pair is WAY TOO narrow - which is odd, but perhaps they were made in a different factory. If you have a regular-width foot, I do not recommend purchasing these. If you're foot is narrow, then this is a great shoe."

4,Fighter Pilot,"I bought this game as a replacement for the new computer. On the last one the game was perfect. But now I get no movement from the plane with my joy stick. I have tried it with just the mouse, and the game turns and rolls and the picture is black and white. I am minimally satisfied with the game as it is now."
4,Support this Band,"Out of Encinitas comes another really solid San Diego band. I saw them play live with Pinback in Santa Barbara, and although the crowd seemed to show no interest (which didn't make sense considering they were there to see a very similar band), these guys had some great, if not excellent stuff. Give this CD a listen if you like Indie Rock; you shouldn't be disappointed."
4,"Yeah, they're pretty good","Saw Jade Shader play LIVE with Pinback, they have some decent stuff. A few songs really made my head nod up and down, good harmonies, some yelling, they aren't half bad."
1,Terrible Deal,"It's really hard to tell for sure from the description, but this item truly is a little bag with only 27 dowels in it. After shipping, that comes to a little over $0.50 per dowel. Insanity. Wish I would have stuck to my better instincts and looked elsewhere."
5,Early Sabicas,"In case you're not familiar with Sabicas (1912-90), he was one of the greatest flamenco guitarists of the 20th century and a major influence on all his successors, most notably Paco de Lucía.Sabicas's creativity was astonishing, and in 40 years of listening to him, I don't think I've ever heard him play an unmusical note. Nevertheless, his early recordings have a drive that is not always present in those he made in the autumn of his career; and this album, from 1960, is one of the former. In a word, it's terrific. The contents are listed in the wrong order on the cover. The correct order is:a1) Farruca del Caminoa2) Bulerías Claveles en Flora3) Danza Mora Maaraa4) Seguiriyas A Tomas Pavónb1) Soleares Por los Rinconesb2) Fandangos de Huelva Orgullo Flamencob3) Alegrías Salinas del Puertob4) Tientos del RíoThe total time is 39'35"".There are both stereo and mono versions; obviously, the stereo version, ABCS 339, would be preferable."
2,very disappointed!!!,this book contains lots of errors. The author even don't care to upload the correct codes to his website.
1,"Errors, expose to hackers","First of all, the book is full of errors. I can tell right from Project1. No need to read further.Second of all, the code is poorly written.For example, on Project1, if you move your mouse over Update and Delete hyperlinks on the page that displays all the contacts, you would see the actual IDs that you created in your database at the bottom along with the pages that willt ake you to if you click the links . This will allow the hackers to target easily to your webpage and database. The author should get more professional skills before he decides to write a book. Waste of my money and time."
3,Good book if you can catch the errors.,"This book provides some very interesting examples of ASP.NET in practical, usable scenarios. Unfortunately, as prior posters have noted, the book is plagued with errors. I generally like the book, and hope that the next printing will correct some of the terrible typos. It's a shame that such a good book has such problems. I would recommend ASP.NET: TIPS, TUTORIALS, AND CODE as an alternative to this book if you're uncomfortable with correcting the author's code."
4,Outstanding book!,"This book is outstanding! I've learned almost as much from it as from Microsoft's own ""IBuySpy"" demo site. Probably the thing I like most about it was that it is written correctly, using code-behind pages and OO programming principles, not just slopped out as an example. Just being able to use the code as-is without having to translate to ""real world"" standards is a real relief.I've got probably a dozen ASP.NET books, and this is the one (along with SAM's ASP.NET Unleashed) that stays by my side."
2,Books looks great ....,...but becomes a big disapointment until you try to run the samples.I think the book is based on beta 2. No problem about that but why don't they put an update on a website.
2,CD NOT match the Book,"There is some problem with the book - the code provided from the CD does not match the book. The bigger issue is that the viewpeople.aspx (project 02) does NOT display all records from the database, one record will be missed, if you have one record in the table, it will display nothing. Even I tried to used the AtWorkUtilities dll from the CD. It would be great if some one can provide solutions to the problem of the project 02."
3,"Three books in one, but not in a good way","""The Vanilla Kid"" is a confounding book. It wants to tell too many stories at once and in the process leads the reader not to focus on or care about any of them to any great degree. I found myself scanning through pages very rapidly and wishing desperately that an editor had given this manuscript a thorough pruning. I will grant that the twist ending which brings all of the threads together did come as a complete surprise. Overall a decent read but one that's far too scattershot for my taste."
3,Impressive debut from Melbourne's jazz legend,"""Watch What Happens"" was Melbourne vocalist/ trumpet legend's Vince Jones' first recorded effort and despite its fairly low production values, this album has stood the test of time. Those who have begun following Jones' career will notice how young but nevertheless dexterous his voice sounds.Unlike Jones' most recent recordings, ""Watch What Happens"" comprises mostly standards- a mix of ballads (a gorgeous version of As Times Goes By) and uptempo numbers (such as the title track). Also absent is the oft-grating political subtext of his newer material. On Loose Bloose Jones dabbles with some more experimental material to pleasing effect.Jones is backed by a very capable band, however as noted previously, the production on the disc occasionally lacks punch. While not the best Jones album, jazz fans will certainly not be disappointed with Watch What Happens."
2,Economical Serving Size,"While this was an economical way to purchase a 'Large Serving Size' (not available in stores) I was disappointed with the condition the box arrived in and the poor packing of the product. Instead of the bags being lined up and covered with a protective cellophane wrap, they were tossed into the mailing box without any protective wrapping. Individual bags were all crushed. Chips were not as fresh as they are when purchasing them directly from the store."
5,good catch!!!!!,I GOT THIS PRODUCT TO HELP HAIRGROWTH AND ALSO STOP HAIRLOSS AND IT WORKS!THE PRICE IS GREAT IF YOU COMPARE IT WITH OTHER SELLERS AND I GOT THE PRODUCT IN THREE DAYS!!.THIS SELLER REALLY KNOWS HOW TO TAKE CARE OF CUSTOMERS.
4,Arrived before expected date!,"Came exceptionally fast, not sure how it works though because I have been using it for only 15 days or more. I'll write another review once I've used it for the full 30 days. I take nioxin along with Biotin which works really well. My hair has grown over 2 inches in 3 months with Biotin."
5,vitamins,"NIOXIN Recharging Complex Dietary Supplement for Healthier Hair, Skin & Nails 90 Capletsthis product really works!"
5,Great Product,"I love the Nioxin prodcuts, I also use the shampoo. I can tell a difference with my hair growth, from using the shampoo so I figured i would give the supplements a try. I noticed after trying a sample pack of this supplement that my fingernails started to grow. I always had long nails, but for a while I could not get them to grow back. Ive used nail hardners and other various products, but they never worked like this product did. I would deff recommend this product!"
5,Delivered on time!,I received my product on time. I was very pleased with the packaging and the delivery time. I ordered on 12/20 and received it on 12/27 as promised.
4,The New Nature,"Thank you for a great book! My husband was pleased with the condition. Slightly torn cover, but that doesn't affect the content."
3,A musical chameleon,"This greatest hits collection does a good job of representing the different faces of Leo Sayer. Starting off with the quirky but irresistable ""The Show Must Go On,"" (Which is much more interesting than Three Dog Night's cover) the CD begins with the stuff I liked about Sayer. The first five cuts here represent the clever artist that probably never would have been huge but might have developed a nice cult following if he stayed in this direction. How many people are going to write upbeat numbers about a hobo dancing for his supper?(""Long Tall Glasses"")Then producer Richard Perry comes into the mix and Sayer moves quickly to disco (""You Make Me Feel Like Dancing"")and maudlin balladeer. (Pretty much the rest of the CD)This proved to be beneficial to his career at the time, but I think if he stuck to his early vision, he would have a bit more popularity today. Three stars for those early hits and the fact that when it comes right down to it he can flat out sing in that wild falsetto."
4,Sayer's classic seventies.,"All Sayer's hit's are here plus six. In the last half of the seventies decade,this English singer/songwriter co-wrote and charted some classics.Here are all 10 of Sayer's songs, (no b-sides), that made the chart from 1975 to 1981.Four were top ten hits, one a top twenty, and three were in the top fourty.This collection is worth owning for his three gold singles,""You make me feel like dancing"" - 1976.""When I need you"" - 1977.""More than I can say"" - 1980.And then there's the must have , feel good, song -""Long tall glasses"" (I can dance)"" - top 10 in 1975.If you love the seventies you're likely to enjoy this compilation.The C.D. comes with a 14 page booklet that has several photo's,and much career information.These original recordings are from Rhino Entertainment in 2000."
3,When I Need You,"""When I Need You""_ is on my top 10 hits of all time....Can't say I really enjoy this CD though...Enough said.."
2,"CD, The Very Best of Leo Sayer","Ok, has a couple of really good songs but that was all. Didn't recognize many of the songs but that's ok."
1,Waste of money,"If some one asked me what is the worst software I have ever bought, I would say this. This GPS software is just garbage. Copilot live is just useless. In the whole time I owned it I never got a single right direction. Their maps are so out of date, when you type in your destination sometimes you get directions from another city !?I would not recommend it to any one. The graphics and the presentation is amazing..all that ends when you actually need a direction..."
2,Ho-Hum,"The book is great on theory and poor on programming ideas. He writes ""The best way to debug a Java program is with the System.out.println statement, as is the case with any high-level programming language."" Inexcusable language for a professor in computer science."
4,"Not bad, but not enough for programming","I was assigned to use this book as text book, I find it is a good book but a little different in real programming. The theory is much more easy than other books."
5,The Triumph of Life,"Five Lost Years is that rarest of things--an articulate first person account of life with schizophrenia. The author, Christina Alexandra, experiences horror and delusions, but also unrequited infatuations (not unlike us). Despite her illness, she manages to become a Philadelphia Eagles cheerleader (or ""Liberty-Belle""), as well as take courses at Cornell University. Five Lost Years dispels a lot of stereotypes about severe mental illness. For one, Ms. Alexandra is no dummy. Secondly, she is actually quite glamorous (something not usually associated with schizophrenia!). The book closes with an upbeat Christian message, with the intricacies of her ""witness"" elaborated in the Afterward. This book should be of interest to anyone (patient, doctor, or family) associated with schizophrenia."
1,horrible costume,"This was the worst costume i've ever purchased. I looked up the length of the skirt to make sure it would fit. Got it in the mail, put it on and the skirt didn't even go halfway down my behind! The costume was cheap! I couldn't return it because of the policy in place...NEVER BUY from this seller!"
1,No reply,I ordered this product and was reall excited abu how quickly it arrived. however when i recieved the product it was very damaged and a stocking was missing. It appeared to be someones USED costume. Also a button was missing. I sent an e-mail to the seller and have not heard back. I will never purchase anything from the seller again.
2,The waist of the skirt is too small for any normal girl!,"I'm a tiny size, but there is no way that the tiny little skirt was going to fit anywhere but around my waist, which would make it so short that it wouldn't even cover the top of my underwear! Unless your waist is the same size as your hips, don't buy this product!"
2,"Cute, but very cheaply made...","I've been buying Leg Avenue products for years -- including Halloween costumes like this one, but I have never been so dissapointed in the design or quality. This outfit is frumpy in all the wrong places as well as including a skirt that doesn't cover enough in the back for public usage. There are plenty of other lovely costumes by Leg Avenue...you're better off choosing something else. It's not at all as attractive in person as it is in the pictures."
5,this cd is phat,"i remember when these guys started and they had this funny 7"" record w/ bunnies on it....then the music on the record.....oh man. it then seams normal how much these guys mean even now. their music is so angular and dense yet so controlled and almost dreamy and tribal at ther same time, there were only a few other doing similar things. but the rythmic sense of this band is what made it a truly driving emotional force. such fierce drums, and edgy guitars combined with the soft loud dynamic allowed them to just rip it up. interesting compositions, unbridled angst, and beauty and angles. it can easily be compared to other great bands like hoover and june of 44 for its mathematical diversity and heavy basslines. but thank god for drummers who are so free and versatile in their composure to keep the beat and keep the intensity. this cd has just as much power and creative lean in todays music society that it is worth owning if youve ever been into indie and punk rock. ever."
5,Great product - Job well done !!!,"Wow!!!!! This is a great buy for the price. I have a 4 year old who likes to read and play on my nice new coachs.I was about to lose my mind trying to find a solution until I came accross this.The color is as shown in the picture. This cover fits my huge loveseat, it doesn't move around and doesn't need tobe tucked constantly after sitting on the coach. When I put it on, i made sure the elastic bands go deep inside the coachcushions, that's how I got it to literally stick to my coach and it doesn't move at all. Even my husband was pleased with it and wants tobuy the covers for the sofa and recliner. The material is very soft and warm. Thisis a great product if you have kids and don't want your coachs to get spots or tears. I am very pleased with thisproduct. However, If you are trying to upgrade your coach, you might need to add some colorful cushions on top of the cover and maybe a throw to giveyour coach a little bit of a design."
1,The worst country album since Billy Ray Cyrus,"This album epitomizes cliche country themes, while exploiting the honor one holds by being a veteran. Lyrically, the songs have no depth. The songs hold no groove, have no style, and the vocals are often off key. I do not recommend this album to anyone, unless one needs a silver coaster."
3,I have lived a thousand years,""" I Have Lived a Thousand Years"" is about the struggle of a young Jewish girl named Elli and her family during the Holocaust. The new Nazi rule forces the Jews to live up their possession, their freedoms, and their identity. I have read other Holocaust books and I found this book to not bring anything new to the table. It seams to be exactly the same as all the other books, making this book not as interesting as it could be. On the other hand, I found the book to carry a good message; we have grown out of touch with our sensitivity and tolerance of human suffering. I think this book could have been better if the plot something new, but it did carry a carried a strong message."
3,It's okay,It is a good book but it is kind of generic and boring to read for me. It is basically the same as anne frank or any other biography from the Holocaust. It isn't horrible but it doesn't make you want to not stop.
1,I have Lived a Thousand years,"I have lived a thousand years is a great book dealing with the loss of familys and some very hard times. Were doing the holocaust in Reading and I'm so glad that we are! We had to pick a book and read it and I'm really glad that I picked this one! This book is about a Girl that is about 13 and she is moved away from her home with her family, to a getto. From there they are shipped off to many consintration camps without her father or brother. So its just her and her mom. They go through a lot of camps and finally reach the end when the nazies surrender, when she gets home with her mother and brother they soon find out that their father has died a little before. When this girl gets off the train someone comes up to her and says ""man i don't know how someone of your age surrvived throught this, I always thought that for older people it would be hard"" She replies, ""old? How old do you think i am"" The ladies say about 61-62 and she says ""no im only 13"""
5,Wonderful book!,"Elli Friedmann is the average 13 year old girl growing up in Hungary, but fear and hate are everywhere. The second world war ravages on in Europe, and the people who are Jews are the most frightful of them all. Soon, Elli's (later known as Livia Bitton-Jackson) school gets shut down, and they get sent away to a ghetto. She goes to different camps and barely survives. Her tale is honest, true, and heartwrenching. Don't eat when you are reading this horrifying tale, for example, ""Mommy! There's a worm in your soup!"" It's very upsetting. I loved this book so much I did a huge report on it at school."
5,Absolutely Wonderful Memoir. Must Read!,"This story was so engrossing and well-written, I believe I read it in about two hours. The following month, I suggested the library at my school order it for their students. In addition, I assigned it to my 8th graders for a book report. It's a sad, tragic part of history, but stillt this young girl's survival will leave you with joy in your heart and her story in your memory forever! Definitely worth buying!"
5,Excellent - recomended reading!,"You will not want to put it down! It is sometimes difficult reading, simply because of the horror it describes, but it is an excellent book."
5,Intense reality of the Holocaust,"This book was breath taking. It was so intense and so moving. It's like being there with Elli through all the concentration camps, through all the emotions. It was a great book."
5,The book of a lifetime!!,"Livia Bitton-Jackson tells the story of the camps in PERFECT DETAIL. It is a heart wrenching story. I would not recommend it to young readers, but for adults and teens it is the perfect book. I enjoy reading books about the Holocaust. (Perhaps ""enjoy"" is too strong a word."") In my opinion, this one is the best! I've read it again and again, and I've never gotten tired of it. In other words....I love it. It should have gotten 6 stars in my opinion."
4,Holocaust LIfe Stories,"Living in today's society alone is a big enough struggle, imagine your life as a young girl growing up in teh Holocaust. That is what this book is all about. A young Jewish girl named Elli. She once lived a happy normal life at home unitl German soliders took over her country. Her family was forced to seperate and was sent through several concentration/labor camps. Her and her familt were put through hell, as to speak. The book is loaded with facts, and does a very good job of relating them to you. Jackson does a very good job of providing detailed scenes that make you feel as though you are actually spying on the situation feoma glass window up above.Beign one of the few survivors of these camps, Jackson now lives to tell her stroy as well as teach her history at teh NEw York University. If reading real life stories about real life tragic evernts is what you enjoy, then this is definitly a good pick."
5,Helping Kids and People Understand the Value of Our History,"I Have Lived A Thousand Years by Livia Bitton Jackson, an author who lived through this horrible experience in World War Two. Now she lives and writes to tell about her real life story. This book gives you a lot of history and makes you feel like you are actually there. The setting and plot create a whole New World for you. This is very exciting and has many interesting facts. It is about a girl who gets split up from her family and goes to a concentration camp in Germany during World War Two. Find out how she lives through all the torture, pain, suffering, and see if she gets home by reading it. I recommend reading this book for either boys or girls.(I am really 14, but the numbers did not go past 12.)"
4,Review,I recommend this book to all ages interested in the holocaust. It was an amazing personal experience. I love to learn about personal experience s because they almost seem real to the reader.
5,One of the best stories about the Holocaust...,"I have read 10+ books on the Holocaust, visited the concentration camps of Auschwitz, Majdanek & Treblinka, taken classes on the Holocaust & in my opinion, this is one of the best books on the subject, ranking with Elie Wiesel's ""Night"". Her detail & descriptions are astounding and really bring alive her experience during the Holocaust. She also does an amazing job of making the audience truly feel her despair, anger, sadness & frustration towards her situation. This is a short book, but it packs a wallop & I would highly recommend it for anyone interested in learning about the Holocaust. This would also be appropriate for a high-school English or Social Studies class because the author is a teenager (which the students could relate to) & her descriptions are realistic, but not too graphic, which can be an issue with books that describe concentration camps."
5,Wonderful! Heartbreaking...,The detail in this book brought me to tears. I would not recommend to younger readers as the details can be to much to bear. If you have this book you must also get My Bridges of Hope. Beyond the heartache I have learned that life is precious and we take so much for granted and can truly be ungrateful. Great book! Highly recommended.
5,Great Book,"I read this book in 6th grade. I've definately read many books in the over 10 years since, but this one has always stood out in my memory."
