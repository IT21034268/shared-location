1,Unreliable and awful customer support,"We bought this unit for the rare long car trip that we take with our 1 and 3-year-old little girls. We used the unit during 5 or 6 trips since we bought it 9 mos ago and it has now stopped working. It will play for maybe 10-15 minutes and then will freeze up and become unresponsive despite trying multiple different DVDs. I think it may be overheating. A call to customer service was a waste of time. We were told the one year ""parts"" warranty only applied to ""external"" parts. If you must buy this unit consider an extended warranty or buying with a credit card that will warrant the item. Better yet, stay away."
4,mount,This item came on time and it was very easy to set up. it works really great for a splash cymbal or a bell. the only thing i don't really like about it is the fact that that i cant put it exactly where i want it. but its a good buy and the price is pretty good.
1,Breaks easily,The neck of this soap dispenser is only held in place by the thin plastic tube that goes into the bottle that holds the soap. Very disappointed as I expected a higher quality product.
4,"Piers Gaveston, Earl of Cornwall 1307-1312: Poilitcs and Pat","This book contains a well organized,researched and documented amount of fact on POiers Gaveston. Mercifully it avoids all the moralizing that either tries to discount or confirm the homosexual component found in the more ususal accounts. The facts, such as they are, have the frustrating capacity to fuel either position. What's refeashing about this book is its aim to supply the reader with the facts, and willingness to leave it up to the reader come to his/her own conclusions."
2,not so hot dog,I bought this and I really didn't like it very much. The inside of the hotdog was still cold when the outside was crisp and the bun warmer is really just a bun dryer
4,It;s ok,Great for kids but takes a long time to warm up if you wait long enough it browns them nicely.
4,neat,Kids really like it. The warmer is useless for warming but it's a neat little gadget that cooks hotdogs well! I've bought 2 more for gifts!
3,Enjoy It For What It Is,"For the price, this is a neat little weanie roaster. I expected the rods to roll the weiners forward and back along a hot plate, whereas they actually rotate so that the weiners constantly turn above a heating element. If the heat is left on its hottest setting, the weiners char and swell on the ends, sort of like roasting weanies over a campfire. Turning the heat down halfway works much better, contrary to the instructions. As for the bun warmer above the weiners, it sits too far from the heat element to catch any of the warmth when the weiners are blocking the heat from reaching the buns. Think of the upper deck as a bun HOLDER rather than a warmer. This will roast eight weiners and hold eight buns (split-side down). If you want a professional version of this gadget, you'll pay from $200 to much, much more."
4,Hotdogs,"I got this for my boyfriend b/c he LOVES those hotdogs from carnivals and gasstations, and suprisingly, it makes awesome hot dogs! we eat them a lot now, and it makes a great, humorous gift!"
4,Great fun,We got this for our 5 year old who wants to open a stand this summer for the kids in our neighborhood. He absolutely loved it. He was excited because...Now he can make supper! The bun warmer doesn't really heat up the buns but makes them warm enough. I would recommend this item to anyone who has kids.
4,"Cool, but a bit toyish...","Hot dogs & sausages used to be a job for my George Foreman Grill, but this Hot Dog Roller was too cool to pass up. I don't know why but even after it arrived, I didn't expect it to work. The fact is, it does though...Despite its toyish appearance, it really works.I use it in my home theater room, next to my Nostalgia Electronics Popcorn Popper."
3,Its A lot smaller than it looks,"This item really only cooks about four good size dogs at a time , it does a nice job cooking them and make sure to leave the buns in the bag if you put them in the bun warmer or they will just dry out and watch your temp close because this thing will overcook the dogs real fast."
3,Radio Control Hovercraft Book Review,"Overall the book provides a good review of R/C Hovercraft. The introduction of some formulas for computing air flow, size of motor or size of craft may only confuse a novice. The info on placement of the R/C and motor components was helpful. The best advice would be to buy a R/C Hovercraft Kit first, get familar with it and then buy the book."
1,Overpriced and not enought practical information,"This book has a lot of interesting and usefuly theory on hovercrafts. Often, practical details are completely missing. The price is not appropriate to the content. I've had to go back to searching the web for the real nuts and bolts details on how to build model hovercraft. Very dissapointed."
3,I expected more specific how-to information.,"Fine Beauty: Beauty Basics and Beyond for African-American Women. I was looking forward the the BEYOND part, but I didn't expect it to be so far beyond actual technique and how-to information. I could have done without so many pictures of video shoot snapshots (video soul), such a lengthy ""stargazing"" section and definately could have done without the ""fine friends"" section. There was very little useful information in this book."
3,"Gr. photos & basic tips, but lacking in prod. & color info","While the basic makeup application tips are sound and the photos attractive, the book does not provide enough advice on selecting color. I also hoped for a critique on the various makeup lines available to women of color."
3,Not what I was looking for,"The info is mostly presented in a question/answer format as found in monthly fashion & beauty magazines. After the first 60 pages anyone looking for make-up instruction will be sadly disappointed. There is no info at all. Only pictures of the various star's the author has worked with and a little synopsis on their look. Of course seeing RuPaul without make-up was a perk. There is no skin care info or step-by-step make-up application coverage for creating different looks. In fact very little *useful* information at all on make-up application. The pictures were nice but if you are interested in information on basic skin care see Alfred Fornay's "" The African-American Woman's Guide To Successful Make-up and Skin Care"". For recreating different and exciting glamour and evening looks as well as very good step-by-step instruction on make-up application see Kevyn Aucoin's ""Making Faces""."
2,Lacks True Beauty Tips,"If you are looking for a book that will give you makeup application ideas, look elsewhere. But if you want to see a makeup artist stroke his ego by being associated with big Hollywood names, then this is the book for you.When I got this book I believed it would provide me with detailed information on how to apply makeup and what I could do to improve my look. Instead I get approximately 10-12 pages of information that I could have read in a beauty magazine. The remaining pages are filled with photos of the women he has made up such as Brandy, Patti Labell, and Tyra Banks. Then you get to hear about his life. Big Deal.The saying ""Don't judge a book by its cover"" really does apply to this one."
3,A nice start,"This book has some detail in the beginning about certain techniques of make-up application. Overall, this book tends to be to star-studded and not enough information on actual beauty techniques, products, skin care or color selection. If you want to know ""a little"" about make up application and view some beautiful photos of your favorite celebrities, this book may suit you."
4,Wonderful book !,"I enjoyed all of the exerts, and makeup demonstrations. He goes step by step into every application of the makeup.Only one thing that I was disappointed of was that I want him to mention some of his ""most used"" products. What brands of makeup does he use.Other, then that its great."
2,I was duped by the cover!!!!!,"Okay, this book was sort of ridiculous. Because of the cover it leads consumers to believe that they'll be getting tips on makeup application, products, highlighting and contouring. Well they're in for a huge disappointment. Only the first few pages give VERY general makeup tips. The rest of the book is just a showcase of Fine's ""work"" with a really weak explanation of how he did it. It's almost like he wrote the book to brag about his work. This book pretty much sucks...."
1,too little information,This book is used as a platform for the author to show off his celebrity friends and to promote his new line of make-ups. Only the first few pages contain some hints on make-up. The title is misleading and the book does not deliver on its promises.
2,It's nice but...,I enjoyed looking at the pictures in this book. However I really expected to find more information I could use. I loved the looks Sam Fine created in the book but he never told us how he did it! It is a wonderful book that celebrates african american beauty but it left me wanting more.
2,Took nothing from this....,"This book assumes that you know about makeup and is basically a self promoting book about the celebrities the author knows.The first 40 or so pages do discuss makeup tips, but it's overshadowed by the remaining 100+ pages of stories of his famous clientele. Not what I was looking for in a beauty book."
2,The Worst Fear Street Book!,This is the worst Fear Street book I've ever read! It has a bad storyline and you can very easily guess who the killer is! It has the exact plot as the first one and is very disappointing!
2,The suspect is the same!,"Once again Emily is decived. Her sister, Nancy, is back from the physco hospital, and there are funny tricks. The ending is SO predictable its not even scary. Not a very good book. Should have just left the story with the first one"
1,Nothing new,"The stepsister 2 is the sequel to Stepsister.Emily's insane older sister Nancy was sent away as she tried to kill Emily. Now she's deemed sane and is returning to the family. Naturally Emily is afraid her sister might still be out to get her, but awkwardly they start to get used to each other again. Then things begin to go terribly wrong. Someone is out to get Emily.What a letdown! This book is a replica of the first! Okay, the relation between Emily and Nancy is different and Rich is somewhat harder than he was in book one, but everything else is way too similar.If the author doesn't have anything new to add to the story, he shouldn't write a sequel. This is a complete waste for anyone who has read the first Stepsister book. My advice is: avoid this one and read the first in stead.If I hadn't read the first book, then this would've been worth 3 stars. As a sequel however, it's awful."
4,"Light, Cute and Pink","I bought this book because it was pink. I was looking for beach reading and I thought, ""How can I go wrong with a pink book?"" It wasn't deep (but how can you go deep with a pink book either?) It was a very fast read and perfect for the beach. It was predictable but in the sweet way that a Jayne Cooper movie (the lead character) would be predictable."
4,I throughly enjoyed this movie!!!,"Yes, there is a lot going on this movie from sex to murder but nothing new & the actors are all excellent. I would recommend this movie!!"
3,Questions and answers ONLY-type book...,"On this one I did nothing more than flip through the pages after I bought it. It's the SAME as ALL the other Jack Rudman Passbook questions/answers series. Technically, it DOES deliver what it said it would, which is sample questions and answers of previous tests. However, no EXPLAINATIONS to the answers.It is certainly NOT a self-contained study guide, like 120collegecredits.com <http://www.120collegecredits.com> 120collegecredits.com is your most economical, comprehensive deal to passing many of the various clep/dsst/Excelsior exams. I only bought this guide because instantcert did not yet develop a study guide for this particular test (TECEP Operations Mgmt).So buy a used copy if you can find one, which I happen to have! But also check out <http://www.120collegecredits.com> Good luck on the test :)"
5,"Steve Gersman &#65533; Verizon Wireless, National Manager of Curric","I've read countless self-improvement books and books on achieving spirituality. Rose's book is different. It synthesizes both areas in a simple process of understanding oneself and taking this newfound knowledge to create both tranquility and joy in one's life. ""Living Life"" has been a true blessing for me. I recommend this book to all that choose to achieve the life you always dreamed.Steve Gersman - Verizon Wireless, National Manager of Curriculum Development"
2,too small,This wine stopper was too small for the wine decanter that I ordered so make sure you order the right size for your size decanter. It is quite pretty though.
4,it helped me,"I bought this with Cracking the GRE to prepare for the test. I'd say it helped me (my boyfriend said ""wow"" when I told him my score). It has plenty of quizzes for good practice, and they do a great job of explaining the testing process to you. The strategies might take a while at first, but over time it gets easier to process faster. What I didn't like, though, was that beyond the quizzes, nearly everything is identical to the verbal and writing sections of Cracking the GRE. The vocab hit lists are exactly the same- I would have liked some new words.The math on the GRE is pretty simple, so if you want test prep, I'd suggest getting this book only, and get free math prep from the ETS website."
3,Not too good,"I personally didn't like their explanations. Some things they say in their answers don't make sense.I would go for Kaplan's review if I had to pick one.Questions are good if you are not willing to read their answers, but there is no point in buying the verbal workout if you just want questions.Just buy practice exams from ebay"
1,Missing Pages,I got this book a while ago but i just recently opened it and it only had until chapter 5! So the vocabulary hit parade was missing and also the analytical writing section!
2,Didn't work for me.,"I used about twelve of these bombs to resolve my problem. No results, the pests are still ruining my yard."
2,Gas Bombs Have Not Helped Me,"Used 6 gas bombs in 2 weeks and continue to have mounds popping up in my back yard. Twice found a main tunnel, and four times put the bombs in the exact tunnel they were digging before they could close it, pushing the bomb in with a piece of PVC pipe. Didn't work for me. Maybe they all have little gas masks on and sit back and say there he goes again. I have 2 more bombs and will use them with hope they will get the job done."
3,DRAT Those Pesky Giants,"Doubtful that you'll ever kill a gopher with these, but they can be helpful in chasing them out of new territory. I've tried other brands; these are larger, and the only ones that combust dependably."
2,They no longer work well,"I have used hundreds of Giant Killers in various yards over the last decade, but I can no longer recommend them. I assume Atlas changed their formula because they used to work well, but now they go out, often before they have burned even a third of the way. I have taken to drilling a hole in the end that does not come with a hole, cutting the fuse in half and putting half a fuse in each end so I can light the other end after the first end goes out. Getting them lit now is more difficult because they changed to an ( apparently ) cheaper fuse. The old green fuse worked well, but the new red fuse barely burns at all. It looks like another case of same MBA squeezing more profit out of something until it is worthless. I am switching to using lawnmower exhaust."
2,Didn't work for our voles,"This year we got invaded by voles. The first time I tried these I did not cover everything as the directions state and it did not work, obviously. Recently, though, I tried the rest on a series of holes exactly as the product directs but within a few days we had more holes.Anyway, I know this is not a scientific review but it did not work for us. I have used the whole package and it has not gotten rid of our voles. Maybe it killed some but it did not solve the problem.We are now trying this: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005VZYCQC/ref=oh_details_o05_s00_i00Shakeaway stuff and will see how that works out."
1,Did not do the job,"The Giant Destroyer Gas Bomb did not get rid of our mole issues, we bought 2 packs and used all of them and(NOTHING DEAD).But what did work was I waited for the mole and shot it with a pellet gun! Mole dead and only cost me about 2 cents."
2,gophers still there,Bought this product to get rid of gophers however there is no change in activity. Only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is due to the fact they lit very easily and put up a lot of smoke so it seems the product worked however trapping may be the best way to get rid of gophers.
5,Driving Away Burrowing Chipmunks,"The development in which I live is a wooded hilly area so there are many squirrels and chipmunks. The squirrels present a nusiance problem but the chipmunks burrow near the foundation of the house as well as in the woods. Filling in the burrows doesn't deter them because they can smell the pheronomes so they dig out the fill-in almost immediately. The Giant Destroyer not only drives them out of the tunnels but also covers the smell of the pheronomes so the chipmunks don't use the burrow for some time (a week to ten days) so a new hole may not appear for ten to fourteen days. If you can prevent them from constantly burrowing, you'll save your house. The only thing better than the Giant Destroyer would be a black snake."
1,Did not work with a groundhog,I tried 3 of these at once. Covered all holes and dropped them in. Did not work with a groundhog. He ended up digging out of the hole the next day.
5,Works,"Finally got rid of the mole in the yard. Tried another brand of smoke bomb, slimmer but more in the package. Thought it was a deal. It was a waste of money. They would not stay lit. These start well, and keep ""smoke'n"" for a good amount of time. I also tried the mole poison that looks like a worm. In my case, the mole just pushed it out of his hole with the rest of the dirt. I have talked to others that had luck with it. I'd still try these first as you don't have to worry about a dog digging it up! Clean, easy to light, stays lit while stuffed in the hole and dirt covering it."
1,Careful - You'll Need To Supply Your Own Fuses!,"The packaging is full of warnings about the danger of allowing the smoke or the burning material to touch the user.The instructions repeatedly mention the fuse -- but none is included. So you either have to run the risk of contriving your own method of lighting the material (careful - the package repeatedly warns of danger even if used properly) -- or throwing it away.As useless, which it is, since our local hardware store and our feed store do not supply fuses or fuse material.The company has an answering service, even during business hours, and no one returns my calls when I leave a message.A big problem - gophers under our barn and sheds -- but a useless product. I'd rate it half a star if I could."
2,Waiting for them to work,We've used about 4 packages of these on gophers in our yard over the past month or so and we keep getting gopher mounds (I'm looking at a new one through the window now). We're worried about other poisons because of dogs and cats getting to them but are really disappointed in this product. We've followed the directions but keep getting new mounds. Any advice for how else to use them would be greatly appreciated!
3,"Makes you feel better, but doesn't kill moles!","I believe these are partially effective if you catch the moles when they first move in to a yard. Get on them quick and often when the mounds are fresh. If moles are established and already have deep tunnels, then these just won't work, they retreat and come back later. Mostly it just makes you feel better and it irritates the moles for a day or so, before they shove the thing back out of the ground. I think the only real way to get rid of moles is set out with a BB gun and wait, get a cat, or be one of those people that have the talent to properly set a trap (I am clearly not one of those people)."
4,Effective,"I have used this product for over two years with good results. The key is to stick with it until the activity has stopped. Quickly act on each new mound before they get out of hand, and keeping the rodents away will become easier than the initial effort. My method is to first clear the dirt away from the center of the mound, use a narrow stick around the center to find the hold, and sometimes use a pipe to widen the hole as necessary to accept the gas bomb."
2,This works from 2 days to 2 weeks.,"I used this products for many months in my backyard and most of the time it only keeps Gopher away for 2 days. Occasionally, this works up to two weeks. I am going to try a less expensive and more efficient way now."
2,Gassers,"I used 7 of them and it didn't kill a thing, I finally killed the little bastard with a trap...I might not have used them correctly ( but I think I did ) but they didn't work for me."
4,Yard,Seems to work fine. I have acres and rather rural surroundings. The moles just appear from time to time in various areas. I need a lot of bombs for control. Thus far have stopped the infestation this year. have more bombs on hand if the mounds appear
3,No Idea,"No Idea to tell if the product works or not. Can't find the dead body of the mole. Without a dead body, can't really tell."
3,Not a Good Running Shoe,I rated this shoe a three because i thought i could wear this shoe for running but it is not a running shoe. I like the unique look of the shoe and is comfortable for casual use. The price wasn't bad when I bought it from amazon. The delivery came very fast as well.
3,Steering,This gamepad is great all that is wrong is it sensitvy it is to senctive and hard to control
1,color wrong,I ordered navy and white and received a smaller bag in olive and white which I sent back/
3,"Ok, but...","On the whole this is a nice romantic comedy, but ***SPOILER*** the horse dies towards the end which ruined it for me."
1,"""Automatic"" Automatically Gets an Adverse Reaction","I can't stand the Pointer Sisters. I mean, I really can't stand them and I think ""Automatic"" is torture for the hearing. I plain hate the song. I would never wish that one on anyone. ""Neutron Dance"" sounds like an automatic disaster to me. Too bad I can't give this a 0 star review or one in the negative numbers.There is not one song by them that I like; this is a collection I would avoid at all costs.No Pointer Sisters for me, ever!"
1,Up on the soapbox again,"I am a card-carrying NRA member and confirmed conservative, and I am sympathetic to most of the ideas here, but this book was more than even I could take. It's not so much a novel as it is another diatribe against Eastern liberals. The characters are cardboard cutouts, spouting all the familiar cliches. There's a liberal clown (Andy) who acts as a dateboard, and a contrived plot in which dozens of evil escaped cons are brought to justice through the efforts of the brave gun-toting civilians after the Feds turn their backs on the problem. In an effort to show how demented the villians are, there are graphic rape scenes and murders.In addition to the political angle, I just don't think Johnstone's skill as an outdoor adventure writer is up to the quality of Stephen Hunter, Gayle Rivers, or the granddaddy of them all, Geoffery Household (now, unfortunately, out of print)."
3,Excellent portrayal of conservatism vs. liberalism,"William Johnstone's story of escaped convicts terrorizing backcountry campers in Montana is a bit farfetched. However, it is a highly accurate portrayal of conservatism and liberalism. The liberal character Andy is instantly despisable. The character continues to spew forth his ""bleeding heart"" rhetoric as his situation continues to deteriorate. This book summarizes thirty years of partisan politics through an interesting, if unbelievable, story."
2,OK,"Just bought it yesterday and listened to it twice. ""Fashionably Uninvited"" is my favorite track and the reason why I bought the EP. I don't really care for the other songs, but I'm going to keep listening. If it grows on me than it might deserve 3 stars. If you like this then try Martin Grech's LP, ""Open Heart Zoo""."
4,A little gem to catch,"Just an ironic little rock band from where ever they may be. Fueled by guitars, sometimes acoustic and occaisonally a bit abrasive, but layered with electronic elements that conjour an image of agressively sarcastic Canadians invading a trip-hop loungue. However, it's not a novelty or comedy album, it's good music, in a few tracks actually sounding somewhere close to Interpol, other moments sounding more like Brad Sucks. May be labeled CD-Single, but it comes with 6 entire nifty tracks!You can wave it at your friends because you're more alternative than they are."
4,no technical answer to phishing,"The book is a hallmark of our current Internet experiences. The editors go through the various scams circulating on the Web. Like the Nigerian 419. Or the Russian/East European mail order brides. Or the fake prescription drugs. An amazing compendium of the darknet. Some readers may be scared off the net. But more likely, you will gain some protection simply by being aware of the book's advice.One chapter is devoted to phishing. Where an email purports to be from a bank, and breathlessly urges you to log in to your account, to ascertain some important detail. Or the email might say it is from eBay or Paypal, with similar urgencies. The chapter is instructive for many readers. But please note that the editors do not offer anything in the way of a technical antiphishing solution. Their methods involve manual effort on your part. Alas, there will always be gullible or inexperienced users to fall prey to phishers."
5,Identity theft explained and how to prevent it!,"This small sized book identifies and explains the identity theft spectrum and how it occurs. It tells how we are taken in by con men and women and how to prevent it. In some cases, we are even shown how to bring to justice these heartless criminals."
3,It's really cute but too tiny!,"It's much smaller than it appears on the site. It's a beautiful pill box, but you can only fit about 4 round aspirin otherwise it won't close. (And don't even think about trying to get gelcaps or larger pills in there!)"
2,Price Gouged,"I had no trouble opening this pillbox, but once I did I had two surprises. First, it was not polished on the inside. And worse, it had a price sticker on it marked $7.90. Deeper and better made is the Frank Lloyd Wirght pillbox for the same price I found on Amazon. Although not sterling silver it is much nicer and appropriately priced."
2,Visual Wine Decanter,Two years ago I purchased a version of this decanter which was much heavier for about the same price. I am not pleased with this lighter weight edition of the decanter.
2,Be Warned - Doesn't Work with Apple's DVI-to-VGA Adapter on Ice iBooks!,"My complaint is not with the actual product performance, it's more to do with the marketing of this projector. I'm sure it's a capable machine.... I wouldn't know since it doesn't work with my Ice iBook 700 MHz G3. Nowhere - not on the Apple site (which sells this product) or the Epson site - does it say that the Epson 61P (or 81P for that matter) will not recognize the DVI-to-VGA adapter. Unfortunately, that's the only video output port there is on this ibook! It will work fine with the Powerbooks... just not with the DVI-only ibooks. The Epson technical support was very quick and competent, I must say. I just wish they'd mentioned that fact somewhere. Instead of saving money, I will now have to spend even more to buy a computer that is compatible with this machine. I've been assured it works fine with Windows machines."
5,Actually I gave this as a gift,"I do like Black Currant Seed oil, though, and like that you put so many with so much Mgs in each capsule, for a good price! I may buy again for myself next time!"
5,Everday Psalms for Everyday Living,"I have had this book for years now. Joseph Bayly is able to put down on paper so much of how people feel whether their spirit are soaring as high as an eagle, or they're just having a very bad day. The honesty of his discussions with God are refreshing.This book is one that keeps coming in and out of publication. I try and always have 3 copies on hand. Most of the time they are loaned out to people. This book is one I will have in my library until the day I die."
5,GREAT!,"I was hesitant to buy this, but received it quickly and was very satisfied with the quality. Great buy"
3,different than described but works fine,"This wire was PURPLE shielded! looks normal in the pictures, but i wasn't expecting to have a bright purple cable running along my walls. at any rate it works great and was extremely cheap so i can only complain so much."
4,surprised at the quality and it was heavier gauge than i thought it would be for that low price,i must apologize to Amazon.....i didn't receive my order because this post office messed-up but i did finally get it. i feel that we will have a lot of business in the future
4,shortage,"ordered 100 feet of this speaker wire, lable on spool said 100 feet, and only 50 feet were on the spool."
1,Not as described,"I wish I had read the reviews first. They are dead on! The wire is very thin, maybe 18-20 gauge. Also the protective jacket is purple. I had to put my project on hold and re-order larger wire for car stereo install."
2,Over And Over Again... {2.5 Stars},"For all intents and purposes, this is a Bob Marley and The Wailers greatest hits release. I'm not sure how many more ways Marley's hits can be spun, but I do know that Tuff Gong doesn't really bother to spin the many Marley classics into an album in any way that isn't already familiar to even the most inexperienced Bob Marley listeners. The album is great for novice Marley fans that may not be in possession of this already classic material. Despite the inclusion of two remixes and one live rendition, there is very little reason for experienced Marley fans to pick this one up. I gave it two stars because these hits are definitely classic Marley. Avoid."
4,wstrnnut,"I recently ran onto an old 1928 version of ""Nevada"" by Zane Grey, an ex-library hardcover that I had somehow missed in my youth. Starting with action, it keeps the reader entertained and on their toes, all the way from page 1 to the end on page 365. The main character, Nevada, is an easy-going kind-hearted cowboy who was (and still is) the infamous Jim Lacey, a noted pistolero of many of the western states. Nevada, or Jim Lacey, interacts with members of the Ide family, especially Ben Ide and his younger sister, Hettie. Starting in California, the storyline meanders southeast, eventually ending in Arizona and centers around the Mogollon Rim. Readers who loved Mr. Grey's beautiful and accurate descriptions will be pleased to find them again. There is a sprinkling of words and phrases that might be spelled differently than what you are used to; it's just a gentle reminder of prose of that era. With good plot and twists, it's well worth the trouble of finding."
4,"It's nice to have the extra tracks, but...","Has anyone else noticed that the version of ""Souls"" on this release is missing an entire verse? The part about ""All that I'm offering's the heart..."" is gone. I haven't A/B'd it with my vinyl copy but the song seems considerably shorter too. My favorite track on the album, whittled right down. Meanwhile a useless and inferior remix of ""Hot Club"" takes up space where the original version would be so much better."
3,"If you like the 80's, try this....","I love the Stranglers first two albums - I grew up with them (Rattus and Heroes) in the late 70's and for me they were and still are great. However, like a lot of the 80's music, this one doesn't quite do it for me. But if you like the 80's music, you'll probably like this. Give a click on their No More Heroes and Rattus Norvegicus LP's if you want rock though."
2,The album too far,"One thing I remember affectionately about this album is winning a newspaper competition by writing a review of it which said that 'if they write music this bad it is no wonder that life shows no mercy'. I also remember trying to give away my copy to my girlfriend of the time- but she thought it was so bad that she left me!! There were three excellent songs on this album- 'Skindeep', 'No mercy' and 'North winds blowing'. The rest was quite dire. I have no objection to the Stranglers evolving but this was just bland nonsense and the over-production attempted to cover up the fact that there was very little here. Easily the worst Stranglers' album till that point but unfortunately they kept spiralling into blandness after that. Gone were the musical conversations between bass, guitar and keyboards- most of this could have been done by just about any other band. Save your money and buy one of the earlier albums."
4,Want the facts?,"There are those who strongly prefer the Stranglers' early stuff and do not like Aural Sculpture or Dreamtime. Please include me amongst those who do not like the early stuff [which dominates ""The Very Best of"" CD] and much prefer this album and Dreamtime.Update 3-27-12: I purchased the remastered edition of Aural Sculpture. The 8 bonus tracks are good,but not essential. The improvement in sound quality over the original cd is substantial and made the upgrade purchase worth it."
4,Stranglers Go Pop,"As an early fan of the Stranglers after Meninblack and Feline you have to admit if nothing else they keep it interesting and fresh. Actually this album is far superior to the rather bland and uneven ""Dreamtime"". Plenty of great cuts here. ""Skin Deep"" and ""No Mercy"" are perfectly crafted pop songs. ""Let me down easy"" a song about when your time is up is very comforting and a great ballad. Probably my favorite is ""Laughing"" a beatuiful ballad that really can touch you. Elsewhere there are plenty of revved up horn spiced pop gems so I think all in all the Stranglers did a very good job on this one"
1,too many stories and not enough substance,"I am familiar with Rational Emotive Therapy through the work of Albert Ellis, and thought it would be a good time in my life to review its principles. I wish I had just re-read one of Albert Ellis' books. However, I decided to read this book because of all the positive reviews on this website. I was diappointed to find that this book was mostly a series of little stories that illustrate various disfunctional thoughts. I would have rather seen a little more analysis and explanation."
3,Not entirely for me,"The authors belief is that it is good enough to fix behavior and counter productive to try to get to the root of the thoughts that cause those behaviors. Unless you fix some of the thought patterns that make these behaviors arise, they'll just continue to manifest themselves in different ways. That said, the exercise is useful in putting to light some of the behaviors and thoughts that cause anxiety."
5,Improve your mental and physical health quicky& permanently,"This is absolutely the most powerful and helpful book in helping the reader to identify and correct bad thought patterns that are emotionally and physically crippling. It's very user friendly with straight forward, easy to understand and no nonsense advice.I will continue to read this book and work on the basic fundamentals until the day I die!"
4,"Quit struggling, start living.","Dr. Edelstein offers a welcome antidote to self-help and self-transformation books. He encourages us to let go of our mistaken notions, that we ""must"" or ""should"" be a certain way. This allows us to begin where we are, to avoid painful attempts to make ourselves over. We can also appreciate the world, in all its complexity. We can manage our lives easily, without ""controlling"" ourselves or conquering the world."
1,RIDICULOUS AND UNSUPPORTED,"I bought this book after reviewing the 30+ positive reviews. After reading it I could not help but wonder whether people were paid to write these things. For one thing, the author makes broad sweeping comments about other organizations (such as AA being a multimillion dollar org.) without any reference to any support for such a claim . I tooam very anti-AA myself and would have been interested in knowing more about this claim. If you are going to attack tho, best to corroborate. The ""techiniques"" were nothing more than asking 4 questions to one's self about every conflict. I agree, in the same vain as Napoleon Hill, James Allen and Anthony Robbins, that life is about perception and perception about questions but this book was so simplistic and lacked any insight I would expect from degreed expert. After 1 hour I read it and sold it to the used book store. Save your money and buy As a Man Thinketh by James Allen for $8.00."
3,some what Excellent,"I wanted to give 3 stars to this, but I couldn't just because I believe therapy is a bag like a bag of tricks sometimes certain therapies work for certain ppl while others will work for other ppl. REBT while very practical pretends that what you ahve gone thrue, you personal history is of very little importance and what matters only is the here adn now. IT has a high emphasis on rationality. Big problem, most human beigns aren't pure rationalists, if they were there wouldn't there woulnd't be any problems in the first place. Besides cutting out the heart from life and depending on pure rationalism is cutting yourself off from real life."
5,Best I've read,"I have been reading self-help books for 20 years, this one makes a diference in your life. I would tell anyone with a desire to improve their life to get this book and read it!"
5,Mental Judo to defeat all your emotional problems,"To use the old cliché, ""this book can change your life!"" What I found so fascinating when I started using its principles was that it takes such a small shift in your thinking to create a totally disproportional improvement in your emotional state. Really sort of a mental Judo.For me, it turned out I don't even need the full three minute drill -- as soon as I catch myself creating a negative (dumb) thought, I can derail it -- almost instantaneously. Not that I don't backslide. But now even when I backslide I don't beat myself up for it.The fact that the principles laid out in this book are not based on new ideas does not to me detract in the least from their value. Edelstein has put them in a highly accessible form and given us a practical way to apply them. And they pass my test of a good idea -- when I hear it, I say to myself ""ah, that's obvious now, but why didn't I think of that before?"""
2,"Powerful concepts, trite examples","I found Three Minute Therapy to be chockfull of examples that were not compelling to me--people having panic attacks over elevators or paying bills, or a woman having an affair who wanted an ironclad guarantee of financial security should she leave her husband.Cognitive therapy is powerful, but I think that soemone considering this book would be better off with David Burn's ""Feeling Good"" books, which are better written, contain more depth, and deal with more day to day problems than Three Minute Therapy does."
5,Wonderful book - practical tools,"My brain is the kind that needs an easy to remember tool, for times of trouble.The ""ABCDEF"" format of the ""Three Minute Exercise"" is something I can remember and walk through in my mind, even in difficult situations."
5,Ye...Buju just keeps getter better and better...thank Zion!,"Buju is the master of reggae seduction...Bob Marley would be proud! Buju has evolved over the years...from a hard edged, to the point music man to the absolute master of reggae passion...touching everyone...finding a place even in the hardest and most unconvincibale heart! Thank you Ja!"
2,Early Buju,"Good album,but people must remember this is early Buju, before his transformation to what he is today."
2,pretty packaging...,"The paper is glossy and thick. The chestnut cover and solid binding make this book feel like it has substance. And the packaging does. This book would make a lovely part of a gift basket. However, it lacks the basic usefulness of THE NEW DIARY, by Tristine Rainer, or the richness and interesting format of LIFE'S COMPANION: JOURNAL WRITING AS A SPIRITUAL QUEST, by Christina Baldwin. It's one of the prettiest books on this subject, but for a book that took less than an hour to read, it didn't inspire me to spend the rest of the morning writing. Instead, it offered some general suggestions in a ""wouldn't it be nice to write"" kind of way. This book won't spend it's life sitting on my bookshelf--I'll be passing it on, in a gift basket."
4,Cruising in the ocean,"This book was pretty good. It was an absolute tearjerker. Lurlene McDaniel really captured the heart of an girl who really wanted to help people, and the way she writes how a person is really could inspire people. This book is sort of a new style of Lurlene's writing. For one thing, it takes place in a old cruiser on the ocean instead of land. Nice to see a new change of setting. I adore her books.Have to read!"
4,Good Book,"I read many LM books, and likes how she writes. However, Ifound this book more predictible than her others. I did think the story was good and gave insight into other countries and how they live. It also makes you want to help others and be less selfish..."
2,This Just Isn't Believable Anymore,"Heather Barlow, an amazing idealistic teen travels to Africa to help those truly in need. Come on! Modern teenagers aren't this idealistic and don't want to do something like a missionary trip because of the lack of comforts. Modern teenagers don't act and speak like nineteenth century widows. To McDaniel, I say, Get with the program. This just isn't believable anymore."
1,Angel of Mercy,I thought this book was very non-interesting. I could not get into it. It took place in Africa and on the ocean. When I seen the cover at the library it looked interesting. This whole book was so much torcher.
3,Angel of Mercy,"This book is not one of Lurlene McDaniel's best. The plot was quite predictable and I didn't really like the characters, especially Ian who I didn't like at all, because he was so religious and always going on about God, which didn't really mean anything. Heather was also a very flat character. The plot was good but the bad characters spoiled it. However, the sequel is much better and I could identify with Amber much more then with Heather, so you could just skip this one. You won't be missing much."
5,What a great book,"Recently graduated senior, Heather Barlow joins a Mercy Ship set sail to Uganda, Africa. On the way, Heather meets Ian McCollum. She and Ian become fast friends. Like Heather, Ian wants to make a difference in the world by providing medical service for the needy. But when disaster strikes, and baby Alice needs help from the Mercy Ship staff, will Heather make it through safely with Alice?"
3,Family Movie: not so savage Indians,"Sort of a comedy family western with kids, a singer (Charlotte Ross) and a woman gun fighter.The Indians are good and kind, the terrible mountain man is a kind hearted hermit and the fake Indians are the stage robbers.The best part of this movie is the singing by Charlotte Ross.Otherwise the movie is a pretty boring and predictable adventurefamily western."
5,Perfect.,This book is absolutely perfect for anyone who is either thinking about going into radio or who is already in radio. James' stories are hilarious and interesting. I read the whole book in one night because I couldn't put it down. A must read.
3,Marry Your Artist's Way,"As I read Marry Your Muse, I was constantly reminded of The Artist's Way, by Julia Cameron. The entire book sounded like a reworking of the information in Julia Cameron's book, which is ironic since Jan Phillips says to keep originality in mind as you begin your work. Her autobiograhical stories may, indeed, be original, but The ""Artist's Creed"" is simply a variation of ""An Artist's Prayer"" in The Artist's Way.Marry Your Muse is for people who don't want to do all of the assignments that are included in The Artist's Way or The Vein of Gold.The photographs are great."
2,"OK, I'll be a weasel...","I purchased this book for two reasons:(1). The good (although scanty) reviews it had received;(2) The chapter on web-enabling a Notes db. So far (I've had the book for a month or so), everything I've looked for in this book, I've also found in the Application Developer's Guide and Programmer's Guide Part 2 from Lotus; the ""yellow books"" (and online help) generally have more detail. The most useful bit of information I came across in this Developer's Guide is a blurb about a bug related to Authors fields. The Domino chapter is sadly poor and basic. I learned more in a day of experimenting and using the ""Working With Lotus Notes and the Internet"" book from Lotus than I did from this chapter. What I was hoping for is a book that would supplement and expand on the content in the ubiquitous yellow books. I didn't find it here."
3,Good basic reference,"If you're a novice, this is a damn good book.If you're a seasoned programmer with some Notes experience and training who wants to firm up their knowledge of Notes development think twice. There either isn't enough detail in some of the chapters, or you get 30 pages of macro statement descriptions (what is wrong with the help file anyway?).Still - it's well priced and a good read. Can't complain too much because most of the other books on Notes development are truly woeful.Didn't get the CD. Why not? Is this normal? Still - I could download the examples and burn my own."
1,Cecelio Not Set Up Well,"I would stay away from this brand, and instead go with a name brand violin. Mine had pegs that were drilled in the wrong place, which caused the pegs to slip when the weather changed. The strings were inexpensive and broke quickly. I spent almost as much as I paid for this to get it working properly, and because the pegs were not properly drilled the holes began to get cracks in them. When my child is ready to move up to full size I will buy a name brand, not an inexpensive violin. You cant get away cheap."
3,Made in China,"The violin's bridge needs to be adjusted when it come to us. When we did that, it popped from the violin. We ended up returning the violin."
3,"It's a great value, but...","This violin is a great value- not too expensive or anything, overall pretty well made.However, it has it's downsides.Mine won't stay tuned for anything. The peg for the G string comes loose when I try to tighten it so the tension isn't retained in the string. Also, it is VERY squeaky starting out. This could be because I've been out of practice for a while, but I'd recommend getting better rosin that what comes with it.Other than that, it's a pretty good little violin."
3,a couple off for screaming girls,"blink 182 is a sell out. mtv bought them out as soon as the whats my age again video was played on mtv. now little teenie boppers go to the concerts screaming and now they are pop NOT PUNK. i am dissapointed. its sad what mtv does to bands like blink , papa roach, eminem and even limp bizkit. they used to be a HEAVY METAL band that played ozzfest."
1,Dont Buy It,"When i bought this cd i thought it would be the best cd i ever bought... wrong. The jokes between the songs are stupid. If they just took out the jokes it would be the best cd, but they didnt. I suggjest u dont buy this cd."
2,I don't buy it,"I don't quite believe the honesty of this recording, seriously. C'mon, if you listen to it, there's two guitar parts playing at once LIVE. It's only Mark, Tom, and Travis, so we think. Do you honestly believe that Tom Delonge can play power chords and play a melody over them? Gimme a break. I think they messed with the live recordings in the studio. Nice try,Blink."
1,The Worst Piece of Garbage I've Ever Heard,This is not worth commenting on. It has no redeeming qualities.
1,I Love Blink 182,"I absolutly love Blink 182. I have all of their cds and I have to say this is the worst. I hate it. It totally degrades the rest of thier good songs. I mean if this is the future of Blink 182, I'll stick with the classics, such as Enema of the state. I'm only 13, but I can tell the difference between good and horrible music."
3,Live Album okay,"This album contains tones of explicit lyrics and very meaningless phrases. It's not a bad cd, but it's one of Blink 182's worst. I suggest another album because this one's pretty bad, especially Satan. Parts of it are funny though. But, if it was to complete the collection, get it! If it isn't, don't."
5,Punk the way Punk was ment to be played,"This CD is so gnarly. It is the essence of Blink 182 and the quintessential album. Some reveiwers complain that the lyrics are ""sloppy,"" that the studio versions are better, or that the jokes are too ""vulgar,"" but isn't that what PUNK is all about? I think theseversions were way better than studio ones. They were faster, grittier, and well, not studio perfect. Anybody that says that they don't like the CD because of the musical imperfections needs to stop listening to so much fabricated pop and get out there and listen to music Live, the way it is ment to be heard, imperfections and all."
5,THIS CD IS THE BOMB,"I think that this new live cd is awsome and it is a great addition to your Blink Cd collection. This is a must-have for any blink fan. This is probablly one of their best albums. If you do not have this, then you should definitely buy it."
3,Great live show overshadowed by juvenile humor,"I jumped on the Blink 182 bandwagon after `Enema of the State' and really like this band with its fresh and clean sound. I picked this CD up knowing that this is a `live' album with no new songs. Initially, I was amazed at how well they play together. Their sets were tight, precise, and energetic. The beat for `Don't Leave Me' is unbelievably intense. It was easy to be absorbed into the music, forgetting about the 8-lane bumper-to-bumper crawl on the beltway heading home.However, I cannot give this CD the full five stars the music deserves because of the sophomoric juvenile humor that goes on between sets. I found it annoying, which is really a pity because it overshadows their brilliant musical performance. I will be leaving this CD at home, and be getting my Blink fix through `Enema of the State'.I only recommend this CD if you utterly worship the ground they walk on, or cannot resist buying CDs. Otherwise, wait for their upcoming release."
5,Who Ever Said Live Cds Suck?,"This is the best live cd on the planet period. It is classic Blink 182. It has every good Blink 182 song except ""Josie"" for some weird reason. It seems to me like Blink put a little more effort into their live cd than most other bands would. The inbetween song jokes are hilarious. When I listened to it the first time I cracked up laughing. Later that night my friends and I just skipped all the songs and listened to the jokes. Tracks 21-49 are all jokes and gags. The funniest is when Tom encourages the crowd to say dirty words. The live versions of all the songs are great and the studio track ""Man Overboar"" is also. Bottom line: Go by this cd now. If you don't you'll regret it when it comes off the shelves on January 7th."
5,A Very Great Cd.,"This is a very, very good cd. Anybody who says Blink 182 [is bad] live must not be a Blink 182 fan, because Blink rocks live. The live version of Whats My Age Again is a masterpeice. All The songs are performed well. The ""jokes"" between songs are entertaining and some of them are hilarious. This is a must have for Blink 182 fans, wether you like their old music or their new music this is a great cd."
4,Not usually a fan of live cd's,"I generally don't like live cd's all that much for whatever reason. But this is pretty good. The jokes in between the songs are really funny. So is Family Reunion, however immature it is. This is good, especially for a live cd."
1,Worst Idea EVER!,"Whoever thought, in the deepest darkest region of their primitive brain, that Blink 182 (the WORST live band in the history bad live bands) should record a live CD should be drug out into the street and shot. If you're a big fan of songs missing 4 or 5 guitar parts and vocals that NEVER are in tune, then pick this bad boy up. HOWEVER, if you have any taste in music, or any decency as a human being, do not buy this album or be caught listening to it."
4,Funny,"Its blink so of course its gonna be immature and rude... and funny. Blink is just a barrel full of laughs through the whole cd, even just before ""Adam's Song"" (which is one of my favorites) ... if you don't care much for humor just buy enema of the state, but if you like blink's humor definitely get this"
5,awsome cd,I have to say that this is one of my favorite Blink 182 CDs. I'm a total Blink fan and I love this cd. It has their best songs on it and so much more. Just make sure you listen to the hidden tracks. If you have ever been to a Blink concert you know that they always have some kind of self degrading talkshow lined up for you. Well that's what the hidden tracks are. I'ts hilarious. It's almost worth buying the cd just for that. I'm glad i bought the cd and it was totally worth it. You will love it.
3,no josie?? why no josie??,"Why no josie??? i asked myself this question over and over again after seeing blink in concert this summer, and since its not on this album either, i will ask it again. i'm starting to wonder if the real life ""josie"" ended in a bad break up and now mark is too sad to sing it. this is a cd for anyone who really really likes blink, or if you're a 15 year old girl. for a little more than the price of this album, you could've seen blink, bad religion and fenix tx live this summer, but now all you're paying for is an album of songs that you've already heard. just go download ""man overboard"" from napster. i like blink, although i'm almost ashamed of that now days. i didn't mean for this to sound so negative, its not blinks fault they have a bunch of new mtv-aged groupies that probably think half this album is new stuff. but i mean come on guys, a live album? for a punk band? how much money do you need??"
3,"Good music, bad jokes...","Blink 182's new Live album is pretty good as far as the music goes, most of the good songs from Enema Of The State are here, plus the favorites from Dude Ranch and earlier cd's. Also included is a new studio song Man Overboard, which you can hear on the radio pretty often, and about 27 ""bonus tracks"" which include Blinks ""great one-liners."" These one liner's are only great if you are a 12 year old teenie bopper. I have two words for these guys, grow up, its not funny every time you use an expletive, which seem to be what all the jokes consist of. If you don't own any Blink Cd's and want to get one however, I would get this one, only because it has all the good songs on it (except for a couple from dude ranch, and 'The Party Song' from Enema.) But if you own Enema Of The State and Dude Ranch, dont bother getting this cd, just get the man overboard mp3 and dont bother picking this cd up."
3,Profanity Kills the Talent,"These guys are really talented. They have a unique sound that is combined with youthfull lyrics that appeal to many generations. Unfortunatly, the verbal banter between songs is offensive and unnecessary - I don't even find it funny. And I'm a Howard Stern fan!. As much as I enjoy this band's music, this CD won't be played in the car or in my 13-year old's discman."
2,No new music,"There's nothing on this cd that doesn't exist in Chesire Cat, Dude Ranch, or Enema of the State. The only difference is Mark's stupid jokes inbetween the songs. Save you money for Take of your Pants and Jacket."
3,Loosin It,Blink 182 is totally losin their punk sound and they might as well stop writing their own songs and start the dance lessons cuz they're gonna be one hell of a boy band which kills me.
5,WOW!,What can i say? If you like Blinks songs then the album rules! If you Love their humour then this album is a must! The sings are perfromed well and the jokes in between are hilariuos! Oh and the album containd lie 20 bonus tracks which are Mark and Tom talking rubbish and telling jokes! I gave this album 5 stars buts thats only because their isnt a 10 star option! WOW!
5,good,"i hate people that say this band sold out, they didn't , same music now as on cheschire, how can u blame these guys for wanting some more money, i mean u would do it too. u think blink is following a trend with music, well you people are also following an even bigger trend by saying they have changed...ah ha think about that"
4,The Enema Strikes Back with Power,"Dear Costumers who would like to know about buying this cd, This cd is very good if you really like Blink 182, but you really have to like old Blink because it has songs from Enema of the State, Dude Ranch,and Cheshire Cat. If you are a true Blink fan definatley get this because it gives you a great mix of all there songs."
4,"BLINK BLINK BLINK,WINK WINK !","GOOD FOLLOW UP ALBUM.BUY THIS ALBUM RIGHT NOW,STOP WAITING AND BUY IT."
4,Awsome cd....needs a little maturity though!,"This cd by far shows how great of entertainers Blink 182 are. They entertain in everyway from thier sexually oriented (..) jokes to their awsome songs. I got this song yesterday and I havn't listened to anything but that cd. If you liked ""Enema of the State"" this is the cd for you. The only thing that gets a little annoying are all the sexual jokes they make (....) Those comments they make put a side this would be a 5 Star cd!"
3,"Great Band, Funny Jokes... Bad Music","Blink 182 is a good band and even though all their songs sound the same they are all good. My one gripe however is that they are horrible live. They sound out of whack live and are a much better studio band. I will admit that they are funny, hilarious jokes that don't get old. I saw Blink in concert and I thought they were really good, but when I heard this CD, i was dissappointed."
5,good cd and i like it because it is good.,"this a funny cd. i think you should buy it. blink 182 is soooooooooooo awsome live. they're actually better. they actually have ""peggy sue"" and ""carousel"" live on this cd. and one song recorded in the studio, ""man overbord"". if you havn't heard ""family reunion"" then you should buy this. f**k yeah!!"
5,The Best Band On Earth Delivers Endless Laughter,"This album is a compilation of songs from their previos 3 albums mixed in with downright hilarious dialogue and humor between band member mark and tom. This album is a sure by, especially for Blink fans!"
2,Save your money..,"..if you're older than 13. Being a huge fan of ""Enema.."", I was extremely disappointed with this. The between-song banter is embarassingly vulgar, immature, and lame. There's no humor to it at all, they just seem to be trying to out-swear or out-gross each other. I outgrew that stuff in middle school.Save for decent versions of ""Adam's Song"" and ""Going Away To College"", there isn't much to recommend this musically, either. The vocals are sloppy, and in general, the studio versions of the songs are much better. The incessant shrieking of 14-year-old girls is really grating, and ruins even the better tracks.Maybe I'm too old (27), or I got to the party too late (the only other CD of thiers I own is Enema) but this was a huge let-down. I had no idea these guys were this juvenile or disgusting."
3,Grrrreaat!,"I think this a great CD. It has a lot of good tracks and I especially like their new single-Man Overboard, which has been on TRL for a while. In conclusion if you bought their old CD- Enema of the State it is just as good and even if you didn't buy it i suggest buying this one."
3,Good Cd,"This is a good live blink 182 cd....Almost too good. I have a couple other concerts of them and the quality of their singing and playing isn't anything compared to this one. I thing their was some kind of tampering with the vocals. On the other blink cds, you can't even understand half of the things tom says, but everything is clear and understandable on this cd. Oh-well, besides that, the cd is good because they change the voice patterns on some songs like What's my age again and Voyeur and Pathetic. Even if they did mess with the cd, i still love them."
5,All the best,"Item as described, even better, got it quite quickly (it took only 10 days to arrive) even from the other side of the globe for a real bargain."
5,Best live album ever,This by far is the best live album i have ever listened to. This mainly due to i love blink but also they talk and communicate with the audience that hilarious and crazy making you feel like you are at the show and just listening them like some held a recorder to a speaker.
4,Oh yeah-The Blink Boys deliver AGAIN!,"At first I was like--I'm not going to buy another live album from a band whose CDs I already own. But then...I fought the urge and purchased it. SO GLAD I DID! Not only is the CD filled with different melodies and takes on old and new Blink 182 songs, but it's also chock full of hilarious jokes and excerpts from concerts, including my favorite ""I'm old-school Hating Mark guy"". You'll have to buy it to believe it. Join in the fun, Blink 182 style."
2,Editorial Comments from the Publisher,"""Parody of all fairy tales"". Large cast, male or female / simple sets / 45 minutes. STORY: ""In this merry adventure, we find such familiar characters as a wicked stepmamma, a giant, a fairy godmamma, a lovely young girl and a handsome boy. There are exciting difficulties to overcome and amusing antics to go through before the story is solved. Equally entertaining for children and adults. Plenty of action, and laughter in abundance."""
5,The best of Middle East cooking,"Lebanese cooking is the queen of Middle-eastern cuisine. (If you are lucky enough to live in the Northeastern US where Lebanese restaurants are to be found, you can experience this yourself.)The Lebanese are particularly skilled with vegetarian foods like beans and salads. You can make hummus (chickpea and sesame puree dip) yourself instead of paying high prices for average preparations in the grocery store. Also, the tabbouleh recipe here is wonderful. This is a salad of soaked bulgur wheat (a bit like a pasta or rice, made of cooked, dehydrated cracked wheat berries) and tomatoes, parsley and lemon. It's refreshing and great for summer and to take to covered dish parties.You don't need meat to make good Lebanese food, as this book amply demonstrates. This is now one of our kitchen standards, and it really adds color and life to the vegetarian table."
5,Best Lebanese Recipes,"If you are a dedicated vegetarian and also a lover of Lebanese food, this is the book for you. I searched a long time before I discovered it, and you can't go wrong with this delightfully simple book. The classic reciple for hummus, for example, is perfect without any fanciful alterations."
3,not exactly what I was looking for,I think maybe I wanted more of a Mediterranean cook book then the Lebanese cookbook. I have only tried a couple recipes and they were good. I was looking for more use of avocados and some humus recipes.
4,Worth it?,"If you come to this album wanting the same, wonderfully eccentric, invention of early WR (and the great Jaco in particular) you will probably be disappointed. If you want some pretty cool music, played with a funky, laid back groove, I don't think you can go far wrong. There are 4 or 5 WR albums I would grab first from the burning house, but I'm very fond of Sportin Life. Yes, Shorter generally takes the 'less is more' approach to extremes, but his solo on the beautiful Confians is gorgeous. Loved Marvin, love the fact that WR let 'What's going on' breath. I often wonder what the point of cover versions is, but they show a new angle. Corner Pocket is a frisky opener, Indescretions is a creeper which has grown on me over the years, Hot Cargo not one of my favourites , Pearl is a great groove and tune, Face on the Bathroom Floor is an interesting Shorter excercise, and Ice Pick Willy a joyous larf. Enough? Enough! Give it a chance."
3,Only for those who have to have every WR album...,"This album starts out promisingly via Zawinul's CORNER POCKET, with its trademark third-world theme and a quartet of vocalists including Bobby McFerrin. However, from there the results do not compare favorably with WR's best work. INDISCRETIONS offers a mid-slow groove and little else of interest, and while Cinelu's CONFIANS is a fine feature for its composer, it lacks any distinction as a Weather Report vehicle. Outside of some fine work behind Cinelu on CONFIANS and on his own FACE ON THE BARROOM FLOOR, Shorter's contributions are negligible, living down to the cliche that he is present in name only during this era, and McFerrin's appearance is hardly a vocal showcase. Marvin Gaye's WHAT'S GOING ON is an intriguing choice, yet Zawinul and Shorter rarely take command of the melody, leaving somewhat of a sterile emotive atmosphere that negates its other interpretive benefits. Pass on this one unless you're a completist."
3,Collects dust in my collection,Not much on this disk worth recomending unless you own the whole collection and want completeness. I own the complete Weather Report canon and this disk probably gets the least amount of play.
2,Too Laid Back,"There are some good funky tunes here, with excellent rhythmic underpinnings, but overall everything is fairly forgettable. Everything seems to lack intensity and drive, and the music often loses its sense of direction. Standout tracks include Corner Pocket, Pearl on the Half-Shell, and Ice-Pick Willy, but even these tunes lack a certain drive. Where's Wayne Shorter's wailing saxophone?The group sorely misses Jaco Pastorius on this album. Victor Bailey is a formidable player, but lacks the imagination that Jaco brought to the group(at least he did when this was recorded).Not a complete waste, but not worth your money unless you are a real Weather Report/Zwainul/Shorter fan."
5,Very pleased,"Durable and lots of room. Very pleased with the purchase. Lots of separation for liquids, razors, etc. Would purchase it again."
4,Works,Quality was good and works as expected. I was disappointed it was not USA made since many OTC products are.
2,the Album that made Columbia records dump the man in Black,"This was the very last original album from Johnny Cash to be released on Columbia records, after you listen to it you'll see why. A few good gems are on this, like his version of the CCR classic ""Have you ever seen the rain?"" but all in all this album is just lame. BUT I will say this......he then signed to Mercury records and made 5....yes 5 totally awesome CDs! Buy all 5 of those merucry releases......1.Johnny cash is coming to Town....2.Water from the Wells of Home....3. Classic Cash '88 (re-recordings of his big hits)....4. Boom-chicka-Boom.....5. The Mystery of Life."
4,Christian Rap,Cross Movement Records does it again. They have great artist who are dedicated to God! This CD is more of explaining how and why they use hip hop and the way that it must be to accomplish God will in our lives through rap. The CD starts out saying that this CD is not a CD you just bump in your ride but is a resource tool. it has computer media and the CD that you listen too of'coarse. if you like Cross Movement Records or just checkin them out this is a great CD God Bless and PEaCE!
2,peerless22wallmount,Be sure to understand the weight limit of this product. Many 22' TV's are too heavy for this!
2,Nice--once you can mount it,"Wall mount itself is nice. However, sure would be nice if the instructions would include mounting templates that you could place on the wall to mark to assist in mounting. The instructions do not tell you the number of inches from the center for the mounting screws--if you are going to center the TV on the wall, the screw mount for this is 6 or so inches to the left of the center--so most likely you will not have a stud. You have to be an engineer to figure out the placement!"
5,Excellent LCD mount,"I purchased this mount for use with a 15"" Polaroid LCD TV in my Kitchen. It's very sturdy and the build quality is excellent. It was simple to install as well - took about 10 minutes. It doesn't sag, but then again, my TV is only about 12 lbs. Overall, it's a great product and exactly what I was looking for."
2,Not what pictured here or Peerless' PDF!! Specs wrong too!,"I'm downrating this product BEFORE I actually use it to hopefully catch your attention BEFORE you buy it! I read a bunch of reviews here, mostly favorable. One noted the itme pictured here on Amazon is different then what came. TRUE. It is also DIFFERENT than the item in the PDF from the Peerless site!! Seems there are 3 LCS-KLA'a but nobody (Peerless) has bothered to revision them ie. -1 -2 -3 etc. What I thought was the one in the PDF was the correct one, WRONG. The one pictured on the Peerless site IS the correct one. So it has a flat/squareish TV side plate with eight ROUND screw holes (not tear shaped) and it does NOT roll +/- 5 degrees. If you've ever hung a TV before tear shaped screw holes let you hang the TV on the already wall mounted arm EASILY! The 5 degree roll lets you correct a less than perfect install. I'm am currently waiting for a call back from a Peerless tech. I showed the CSR the bad PDF."
1,Not weight rated correctly,"Unfortunately this wall mount is not weight rated correctly.It was recommended for my TV, which weighs 22.5 pounds, clearly within the 25lb limit.However the joints are strained and the set sags out of level depending on how the arm is extended. I probably should of returned it, but after going to the trouble of mounting it to my wall, I'd rather not start over with another. After reading the good reviews, my guess is this mount works well with sets under 20lbs. If yours is heavier, I'd look elsewhere."
3,Tricky to mount,"As with so many other people, despite using a level, measuring thrice, etc., when I mounted my monitor (Samsung 941BW) it drooped noticeably when fully extended. I had to re-drill a new bottom hole (used the old bottom as the new top), but now my monitor is mounted perfectly.Also, I had to use a bigger drill bit since I couldn't get the gigantic screws in using their recommended bit size.p.s. The version I received had the teardrop holes on the monitor plate."
1,Terrible,"This wall mount is awful. It is not well built, thus it sags and is near impossible to get your TV to be level. My TV is currently level, but only because I jammed a piece of cardboard into the articulating piece. I would not recommend this wall mount"
2,"Mine does not tilt, and it is difficult to level.","As a previous reviewer noted, even when using a level before drilling holes in the studs, when I hung the mount, it was not level. It took me 3 tries and 3 separate holes in my wall before I could get it almost level. Also, the description states that it has fingertip tilt, but mine will not tilt at all, no matter how hard I try. Otherwise, it does fold within 2 inches of the wall as described. I would recommend attaching the TV before attaching the mount to the wall as this helps with the leveling process."
4,good,"This product came will all the mounting and adjusting accessories. You just need a drill, bit, screwdriver, and hammer to install. Moves smoothly."
4,Sleek and cheap,I used this mount for a DLP projector because I liked the price. The design can be improved to allow the tilt be 90 degrees. Still an extra fixture/adaptor can be an accessory for mounting DLP purpose. I made the adaptor by myself since I am an engineer. It works fine for my home theater. The screws are now long and strong -- imprevement from previous reviews.
5,LCD Wall Mount,"Excellent product. Great price. Arrived quicker than expected. My husband was so impressed with how detailed and organized all the parts were. I will buy from the ""Peerless"" company for our next flat screen TV mount."
5,Not Bad,This is my forth purchase of a Peerless mount. I find their mounts are dollar for dollar the best mounts out there.
3,Easy to install-but 1 quirk!,This wall mount is great for the price. It's light weight and very easy to install. The only downside is there is no place to hide the cords from the tv so they hang and look unsightly.
1,DOESN'T TILT !!!!!,"It says in the item description ""one touch tilt"" and 180deg of swivel. It swivels very nicely but, WHERE IS THE @#$%ing TILT??!!!!!! I bought this product because of the company's quality, also because I need it to do both tilt and swivel. ""It didn't deliver""!!!! It is useless to me at this point and it's past the 30 days. Thanks, PEERLESS!!!!!"
5,Very Pleased!,This product works perfectly. It tilts and swivels and is inexpensive. I had it out of the box mounted with the tv on it in minutes.
4,"Sturdy, works well.","The arm is sturdy and works well. It'd be nice if it had some sort of cable tray, but perhaps that would have made it unacceptably thick (the TV sits an inch or two off the wall when the arm is folded flat.) When folded flat, the TV is not centered on the bracket, so the bracket is a little assymetric when extended."
4,PERFECT for the $$,"This is the most affordable and flexible mounting I found online - I highly recommend it.However, I would strongly caution people to take it easy on the screws - they strip easily. I just mounted it last night but couldn't put the tv on it because the vertical swivel was too loose - I tried to tighten but it stripped - now I've got to remove the stripped screw and put in another, and then tighten the swivel and remount the tv. Once thats complete I think it'll be perfect!"
5,Very Satisfied,"This product definitely lived up to my expectations in terms of quality for the price. It's a good looking product with the brushed aluminum type finish, and the pivot points are nice and tight. I have to agree with the other positive reviews. After reading all the installation comments, I went ahead and pre-drilled into the wall stud then installed it using the wood screws and a screw tip on my variable speed drill. I drilled into scrap wood first in order to find the best size hole for the screws. (Nothing worse than stripping a screw head halfway in!) All in all a great purchase!"
1,If you find a rock,"It was a ok book, I thought it works better for a display book. Pictures are nice the message okay I thought it needed a little more."
5,Romance of Rocks,"Not science and boring, but personal and magic. For youngsters who throw rocks and like them, to lead them further into how neat rocks are. The truth about rocks at a young human level."
4,Great Book,"I bought this book for my 7 year old grandson who loves rocks. It is not a colorful book at all with pretty pictures of rocks but he loved the story. It talks about all the different kinds of rocks you might find. (example:a skipping rock, a chalk rock, a moss rock) It doesn't identify the rocks as granite, sandstone, etc. but it talks more about the places you would find rocks. After reading the book, my grandson and I went rock hunting and he mentioned several times about things we had read in the book. He loves the book."
4,Fun for young child,"My son (5 years) really enjoys this book. He does love to collect rocks. He liked the way this book discusses various rocks. After I finished reading the book, he tried to think about types of rocks not mentioned in this book."
4,Great reference for Sculpture Class,"This book is filled with examples of Noguchi's artwork, mostly sculpture. I am currently enrolled in a Sculpture Class and found viewing the pictures a helpful reference for the sculptures I produced. It is most important as an artist to be influenced by other artists, and I feel that this book was successful in doing just that."
5,Highway Pegs,"Very good quality product, shipping was fast and product installed fairly easily, they really improve rider comfort by allowing an additional foot position while riding"
4,Solid selection of hits but lacking in soul,"Another good mix from UKF, featuring a fairly solid selection of hits and almost hits. It starts with the Foreign Beggars track I'm rather tired of hearing but after that one gets a little vibe going. The only downside is the continuous mix is lacking in a little charm - it's hard to describe but it feels clinical, sterile, not like a live mix in front of a dancing crowd. I could be wrong but it doesn't get me pumped. However, you can't beat 40+ tracks for the money."
4,sexual harassment to the temporal lobes,"Ok so I spend a lot of time studying and songs with words tend to be distracting. I found out after giving it a try on pandora, I like it. So I started listening to UKF dubstep on youtube, and now downloaded this album. For less then 10 dollars you get 40 songs, some CD's give you more songs for less, but I like more songs on this album then other CD's. I have a full on ear set of headphones I like to use for this music"
2,not a great monitor,"It's not the worst monitor I've seen, but it's definitely worse than most I'd say. The image quality is noticeably worse than my previous monitor, which was also a 19"" monitor. I purchased this monitor because my old one went kaput, and I liked the fact that it was cheap and came in black. I'd buy something else if I could do it all over again.The product claims to be ""plug-and-play."" I really see no need for a monitor to have plug-and-play capability. All that it managed to do was screw up my Control Panel so that I couldn't load Display properties (until I reinstalled my graphics card drivers).However, it is an acceptable monitor for my purposes. You do get what you pay for, so if quality is extremely important to you I would avoid this monitor, and probably this brand of monitor.The good parts (and why it didn't get a worse rating) are that it is quite good looking, and the price is very reasonable."
5,Thomas,"Bought for my grandson, and he loves this game.he is 4 yrs. and its hard to find good games for him to play and learn from but thomas is his fav. right now.we wanted to start him out like his dad who began playing nintendo mario brothers at 3 yrs.. and nick still loves mario at 23 yrs."
1,An uninteresting read,"The characterizations are flat, and the novel is mostly just confrontation after confrontation with nothing to hold your interest. It was boring."
1,THE DOO WOP COLLECTION,"The promo on the cover said original artists.What you are not told is these are not the original recordings I listened to as a teenager.The artists may be the same, but these are recorded much further along in their careers at ""live"" venues,etc.I would not recommend this selection for a true Doo-Wop fan."
4,Great Compilation but NOT Original recordings,"This 3 CD box set contains some of the greatest music of the time. The box clearly states: New Stereo Recordings by Original Artists. All the songs are indeed by the original artists, however, they must have been recorded by them at some latter date as you can hear the difference in their voices. So, if you are a Doo Wop aficionado and desire the original radio versions, this set is not for you. But if you would just like to hear these great songs by the original artists when they were further along in their careers, this is a fantastic set, especially for the price."
3,"so,so","product is as advertised. but, for me, after several weeks of use have not noticed any appreciable benefit. best review can offer at this time."
5,A Perfect Album!,"A Perfect Circle indeed... Not at all the Tool clone that I was dreadfully expecting, but rather its own entity with a definitive style. APC's one similarity is that they, like Tool, have made one hell of an album with good musical chemistry and deep, meaningful lyricism... especially in ""Judith"" and ""The Hollow"", easily two of the best songs I've *ever* heard. Like several reviews before, I can't think of anything bad to say about this CD... nor can I think of a real concrete term to use to describe it, except Awesome. Mer de Noms needs no category, no hype, and no labels... the music speaks for itself better than any review could. So stop reading and buy it!"
4,Incredible amazing to no end,Before this CD I never really listened to the voice of Maynard. After this cd I fell in love with this man's music. I absolutely love this CD. Diffrent from tool Fans should still enjoy this other side of Maynard.
5,Greatest Band in the world,This is some of the most powerful music ever created. It strikes the very soul of people.
4,Excellent,"I applaud Maynard and A Perfect Circle. Being a huge fan of Tool, I thought I might give APC a whirl, and I am glad I did so. I believe Maynard has the most awesome voice, and his lyrics are brilliant. Mer de Noms is fun to listen to and I enjoy it very much. (I'm listening to it as we speak....)However, as much as I like APC, Tool still captures me more. (Maynard HAS to be some kind of overlord, lol) Mer de Noms is slightly repetetive, and I am occasionally lost to what song I am listening to.All in all, this is a good buy, and I would recommend it."
4,One of my favorit's cd's,a well down cd Melodic & Progressive and the lyrics are great favorit track Orestes !!
4,wacca wacca doo doo yea,"this album is really good. i think its alot softer than tool but its still got that dark deep feel which is really kewl. definently a must buy, even for the hardcore metal people."
3,A Perfect Circle / Mer de Noms: Not A Perfect Album,"This is an interesting record, nothing more. Despite great sounds, great lyrics, and great vocals, most of the songs sound the same. Rose is one of my favorites, along with Thinking of You and the first track Magdalene, which is as powerful as Judith. But overall, the CD is not unforgettable, and i picture myself in a near future, just listening to those 4 tracks. Anyway, it's a great thing to have."
4,Good stuff but do not expect TOOL,"It is perhaps unfair to compare this project to TOOL just because maynard James Keenan is at the front. A PERFECT CIRCLE has a sound and rythm all their own. Yes it is reminiscant of TOOL due to Keenan's involvement, but this less angry, more lyrical and maybe braoder on an emotional scope.Naturally it cannot match the artist breadth of TOOL's best work, but in another plain of being this is almost as good."
4,I like it,"I'm sure everyone knows that Maynard from Tool is the singer of the band, and so you probably think that it's gonna sound a lot like tool. In some ways it is reminiscent of Tool; however, it's different. If you wanna know what it sounds like relative to Tool, I'd say it sounds like a more mainstream version with a variety of musical instruments coming into play. A lot of of tool songs have really really weird structures while a perfect circle is a lot traditional. Mer de Noms dabbles with more instruments than any tool album. It's not as brutal and angry as say Opiate, but still interesting and definitely has it's moments of greatness. All the members of the band are extremely talented....I like it."
2,a broken circle,"a perfect circle is far from a perfect listening pleasure. the first six tracks are excellent and a far cry from tool (which is a good thing), except judith. the last six tracks sound like tool songs that didn't make the final cut for their albums. keenan and the gang show they know how to write melodramatic music that feels incomplete after the songs end. if you're a tool fan you most likely will enjoy this, if you're not maybe you'll like one or two tracks."
3,"OH, GOSH DARN IT! WHY?!?!?!","Billy, why did you stop being a Guitar Tech? You were one of the best in the world! You had Guitars in tune when they were needed, and everything! and now you've gone and made an album with a bit of Tool (Duh.) a bit of the Pumpkins, a bit of NIN, a LOT of Iron Maiden (Listen to The Hollow - LATE '80's ROCK!!!!!!) and some Deftoney type signatures. Yup, it rocks. Judith is a great song. Not a great single mind (I can't see ""F**K YOUR GOD!"" going down as one of History's great Chorus lyrics), but then every metaller has to release an uncommercial single, show the SYSTEM that they aren't for messing around with! ""You don't wanna F**k with Billy [WHY?] 'cos Billy's gonna F**Kin' play some cliched riffs at ya"" {Copyright Eminem, 2000, sorta}. But, Well, Rose is a better single, and there are better songs on the album. When it isn't trying too hard, it's amazing. When it is, it's a bit flat. A bit like warm Coke. Flat and Wet if left out too long. Oh, I'm good."
3,Made me remember why I wasn't a Tool fan,"So take it for what it's worth. I always liked the music of Tool, but Maynard's voice just seems so much like the guy from Live that I get bogged down by comparisons (of course, I'm not much of a Live fan either, so I probably should have paid more attention before I bought the album). The thing about it is that I was so in love with ""Judith"" that I really wanted to get the album. And the first few tracks are absolutely phenominal. But then it sinks into what appears to be a Queensryche album and it really loses me. So what am I trying to say. The album hits like a ton of bricks. But it also shows a hell of a lot of influence by something that was mercifully long dead. Of course, in a world full of Limp Bizkit, Kid Rock, Eminem and Creed, it's awful nice to have a band that tries to be something worth a damn."
2,Am I alone,"First of all, I must say that I got this album after hearing rumors (untrue ones) that Tool had broken up. I had hoped for a continuation of Keenan's incredible work in it. After reading a lot of these reviews, I am kinda surprised. . . am I the only one who absolutely loves Tool and can't see it in this one? I know it shouldn't be compared to Tool, but Keenan's voice is so distinctive you can't help but consider it. The music just seems bland, for lack of better words. It doesn't have the depth of, say, Aemima. . . no real rises and falls, no climax. . . you can jump to any part of the song and hear the same sounds. Sorry, but this one made it's way to my shelf of stuff I don't listen to"
5,A whirlwind of provocative emotion stirs in this album,"I have to tell you, after owning this CD for 2+ years now, I can only tell you there are no words to describe. If there WERE any, they would be provocative, haunting, and brilliant. Maynard's driving force of his voice only grows and matures, and always draws the listener's attention. His voice is like a chariot of fire, leading a band of a monolithic symphony toward the unknown as each song passes. I can honestly say the theatrical experience of this new( no, NOT a side project, but an original mastermind of a band; certainly NOT factitious!) gives the true performance of pure ingenuity. Tracks like ""The Hollow"", ""Magdalena"", ""Judith"", ""Orestes"", ""3 Libras"", ""Sleeping Beauty"", and ""Thinking of You are definitely the standouts. If you're into alternative goth rock or metal, YOU WON'T REGRET BUYING THIS ALBUM! Buy it today."
4,Great Rock album!,Enjoyed listening to Perfect Circle for many years and this is one of my favorite albums. I would recommend buying this one!
4,Not what I thoght it would be...,"This is a very good cd, but don't buy it if you think that it will be like Tool or the song Judith. Most songs are more similar to 3 Libras and Hollow. They are still great songs, but nothing like what I thought I was buying. If you liked 3 Libras or Hollow, then this CD is a must have. If you prefered Judith, listen to the CD before buying. Another thins: Parental Advisory!? What!? My CD didn't have a sticker, and it's probably the cleanest rock album I own. If that kind of stuff offneds you, ignor it for this CD."
5,Excellent experience,The album was in great condition as advertised. It arrived in a very timely manner before I expected. Very good purchase experience. Thank you very much!!
4,A Good One,"Not sure what to say but if you're thinking about buying ""A Perfect Circle"" you already know how they sound and you will not be disappointed here with this one. Too bad no more. Looking forward to Tool when they start recording again."
5,Good (but not Tool good),"I like this album it's smooth and is full of talent and great song writing. But if your a Tool fan this is somethign different. A Perfect Circle is softer, more mainstream ,and not as dark. But those are not all bad things. I like it because it's a change from Tool and has my favorite lead singer Maynard James Keenan."
5,wow.....,This is probably one of my favorite cds. I listen to mostly metalcore...but there is just something about this cd that I will never be able to explain. Its a great experience and I can't wait for the new cd coming out.
5,One of the Best CDs I've ever owned...PERIOD,This CD came out a couple of years ago and I still listen to it frequently. Very deep lyrics..beautifully constructed.
3,checking,I've written 2 reviews in the past 2 weeks and neither one of them has been posted. Just trying to find out why.
3,A Perfect Bore,"Allright so they are riding the massive hype. Huge infact. I heard the album with an open mind and ears split wide open. To be fair, lots of it is brilliantly produced with hours of studio time making this project highly polished. But its all about the music and in this case, so much of it is sonic deja vu. Rush was doing stuff like this ages ago. And it makes me wonder when I read the lyrics - ""Where does all this rage and desolate emotions come from?"" Is this just clever writing without any artistic integrtity? After all was said and done, I felt the soul of the music must have been left behind on the edit floor and the songs began to get boring and predictable. Also, while the band, producer and enginners are accomplished, A Perfect Circle lacks a streak of virtusoity. Pity that. Do I recommend it? Nope - borrow it and give it back."
3,NOT TOOL,"i first heard Judith and liked it, so I thought the rest of the cd would be as hard as judith, but i was wrong. the hardest song on the cd is judith. the rest is just soft, mellow guitar, which disappointed me.i still like maynard, but this is nothing like tool, so dont buy this cd thinking you will get a tool-ish album."
1,Hmm...sounds familiar,"Yeah...it seems like I've already heard this meaningless music before, wait! I have! But it was called Tool back then, it's too bad Maynard has risen to a messianic state, as it has given him a chance to spread his stupidity to the masses. THIS IS THE MAINSTREAM. I can't think of a more worthless piece of plastic to waste money on except for maybe Lateralus. If you want real music, GO FIND IT!! Here's a hint: you won't find it on Mtv!"
1,perfect circle = tool for wussies,"When i first heard a perfect cirlce i automatically knew what it was - a radio friendly version of Tool that lacked any of the musical complexity or thought provoking lyrics that tool has. Tool was designed to make people think. A perfect circle is mindless. Notice that everyone who likes a perfect cirlce doesn't like Tool. That is because a perfect circle encourages you to cry in your own self pity to maynards drawn out vocals, while Tool encourages you to think for yourself, question authority and yourself, and open your third eye. My opinion is that A perfect cirlce's massive popularity is due to them taking all that is NOT controversial or thought provoking about Tool and exploiting it."
1,Warning!!!!,this Japanese import contains copy-protection measures and will likely not work in a PC or Mac. DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!!!
5,"Really diverse, a good alternative","I picked Mer de Noms up the other day after seeing the video for Judith. I have to say, its a really great album. The album has a lot of different moods and sounds to it, and is a great alternative to the current rock scene. My favorite songs are proabably ""The Hollow,"" ""Magdalena,"" and ""Judith."" I think everybody should check this out, its definitely worth the money, there's some really great music on here."
4,Something for Tool fans,"If you're a diehard Tool fan and you're looking for a new taste of Maynard, you'll get it here. It's not as dark as the Tool releases, but Maynard's vocals are enough to buy this album. Tracks 1 & 4 have a Tool influence. Tracks 5 & 6 should see some radio air time. It's great that Maynard is trying out some new stuff, but what I really want is another Tool album, please! By the way, Josh F. does some great drumming as well as Tim A. on this album. Get it."
5,"Metal, yet different","Mer De Noms by A Perfect Circle is a great CD for those who are looking for a more unique genre of metal. It contains some hard songs like Judith. It has symphony like songs like 3 Libras. All in all, a good CD."
5,One of the best,"This cd is great. Great melody, great songs, great musicians. Worth every penny and more. A Perfect Circle is one of my favourite bands, second only to Tool. I strongly recommend this cd. Try Magdalena, and Orestes.....my two personal favs."
4,spellbinding,"Rarely does a rock CD have the ablility to captivate a listner like this CD does. The songs a very well orchestrated, and that is a major credit to Billy Howerdel, the real star of this cd. Every track on this CD has a depth of sound that is hard to find in single tracks for most bands. Truly mezmorizing. Maynard James Keenan's voice is less angry and more subtle than in any of his work with Tool. On the down side sometimes the tracks can sound similar and begin to run together, but that is the only fault I see with it."
5,An amazing emotional experience,"This is the best album I've ever listened to. I wasn't ever a huge fan of Maynard's other band, Tool, but this album truly is perfect. I'm just hoping for more releases."
5,ITS AWESOME!!!!!!,"Maynard has the best voice i have ever heard in my life. You cannot compare him to anyone. The music on this cd is amazing.I enjoy every song on here, if you don't have this cd i encourage you to go out and buy it as soon as possible. Tool is one of my favorite bands but when i heard apc, it blew me away.I hope you enjoy Mer de Noms as much as I do."
5,Wonderful Songs,"This is one of the most beautiful albums I have ever come acrossed. The title Mer de Noms means Sea of Names. Every song was just like a poem. Orestes was very good song. And this band is nothing like tool, anyone that says they are just needs to cut away from that thought.This album will be enjoyed by many people with the songs so beautiful and some angry you will be pleased with it."
4,Close but no Tool,"Let me just say I'm not saying A Perfect Circle is trying to be or should be anything like Tool. I realize they are 2 different bands with 2 different musical ideas. I'm just comparing how much *I like* this album to, say, 'Aenima' because of the lead singer.The best way I can describe APC is to say Tool thrown in a messy blender with Smashing Pumpkins. Don't hate me for saying this, APC really doesn't do anything either of those bands already have. It's alt-rock stuff with pretty lyrics.The best way I can describe 'Mer De Noms' is a Tool album on downers. Some of the songs are incredible and moving (Hollow, Magdalena, Rose, Judith, Sleeping Beauty, Thomas, Thinking of You) whereas some are just dull and heartless (Orestes, 3 Libras, Renholder, Brena, Over). The album is pretty decent but not every track holds it's own. You never know though - look how far Radiohead came from ""Pablo Honey"" to ""OK Computer""."
4,Best rock album of 2000 ... until the new Tool release,"This is the best hard rock album I've heard in a long time, and it was a nice treat to hear something new from Maynard James Keenan, the lead singer of Tool. His lyrics and vocals on this album are top notch as usual, but the songwriting and the rest of the band are not up to par with Tool. This comparison may be unfair, however, because the style of A Perfect Circle is very different; the music is much more mellow and the lyrics are much more sensitive and less aggressive. I recommend this album to anyone who misses the quality of hard rock from the early and mid 1990's, and to anyone who is a fan of Maynard's voice."
1,I did not enjoy it,I just did not like it. I regret getting it really. But I have it and I am stuck with it. Can't send things back cause you don't like them.
3,"Good album, but not anything special","When I first heard the song Judith, I was hooked by it. So I decided to go check out the CD. On the first listen, I found alot of the songs to be pretty good, but after 10 listens or so, alot of them wore off. I like albums that you can enjoy time after time, but this just isnt one of those albums. I guess if you are fan of Tool, where the lead singer, Maynard James Keenan, is from, then this CD may be worth the price. But if your not, you would be better off just recording a few songs off a friend or something."
3,For the wussies.,"What a big disappointment for Tool fans. Slow and whiney. This reminds me a lot of Depeche Mode type of music. I think Maynard is strung out or something. It will tide me over till Tool comes out with a new album. Judith is by far the best song on the album, but again maybe because it could be on a Tool album and no one would notice. Buy it, it's still Maynard."
2,Sound bleeding into one,"I've been a longtime Tool fan and an admirer of MJK's vocalizations, but A Perfect Circle left me cold. Compared to the current crop of popular metal flooding the airways these days it does little to distinguish itself and while its musicianship is skilled nothing about it really screams out to be noticed. The songs follow the same formula throughout and in the end all blend into a single sound. Where are the songs that stand out? Where's this album's Prison Sex? Where's its Sober? Where's its Learn to Swim? I'm sure the Korn and Limped Biscuits fans will love it, but that's not saying a whole lot. And what is it with Maynard's bands that they don't include lyrics in their liner notes?"
3,A PERFECT CIRCLE ON CONAN O'BRIEN,I heard APC was on Conan a few weeks ago. Does anyone know where i can get a copy of the video of this performance or at least where i can see clips on the web? I gave APC a bad review but i'd still like to see what they are like live. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Please email me at FreethinkerNJ@aol.com. Thank you!
2,DID ANYONE ACTUALLY LISTEN TO THIS CD?,"I'm seeing the already ridiculous amounts of 5 star reviews and i'm stunned. I had great expectations for this album. Then i put it on and nothing stood out. The songs go nowhere. The snare drum is awful on this thing. When you listen to Stinkfist from Tool's Aenima, at least the snare kicks which helps to drive the music. This stuff is boring. Judith is the only song that saves this album from being a total disaster. I don't know. Maybe I heard a different album than the rest of you. Maybe i just like Tool too much. Whatever it is, A Perfect Circle just doesn't cut it. Feel free to email me ..."
2,Boring CD,This is SO boring. If U R A Tool fan Than U know what a good CD is. This is not 1. It is boring and lacks Good songs. The only good song is Judith.
2,"Lured in by ""Judith,"" lulled by the rest...","After hearing ""Judith"" and ""The Hollow,"" I was sure that I was going to love this recording. Well, I have to be honest and tell you that those two are NOT representative of the rest of the release. ""Judith"" was a great move for the first single--as its aggression and power will have most Tool and Maynard fans running crazed to the record store. The rest is a collection of immaculately-recorded, huge-sounding and average-to-boring songs. I have listened and listend to Mer De Noms--and can find no reason (besides the two I bought it for) to continue listening further. Be warned..."
2,Mer de Tool (Watered-Down Tool),"Okay, so maybe this ""isn't a side project."" Okay, so maybe Maynard gets to flex his vocal range a bit out of the glottal shriek he favors for Tool (a band which I have followed from the very beginning and which continues to impress me). Okay, so maybe I've just grown up since the time that I found contemptuous atheist rants engaging. Fact is, this is basically overrated goth metal, not terribly inventive - but that's not what ruins the record for me - it's the production, especially on the drums. The snare sound is pure 80's arena glam - I hear it and I think Spandex. The guitar tone on most tracks is reedy and thin. If this is unintentional it's unfortunate, as many of the songs would be both tougher and more tolerable with a bit of warmth and fullness. If, on the other hand, the chilliness is the result of the vaunted ""all-digital"" sound that the participants of this ""not a side project"" are so proud of, then all I can hope is that Maynard doesn't quit his day job."
2,Yawn.....,"I am going to compare them to Tool, I know I shouldn't, but I can't help it, I'll compare the lyrics, Maynard's lyrics for Tool are incredible, his lyrics on this album have their moments, but are really lacking. ""Judith"" and ""3 Libras"" are excellent songs but thats about it, every other song is ordinary. If I just listened to APC and hadn't heard anything from Tool, I would probably rate this a lot higher, but I know lyrically, Keenan is capable of a whole lot more."
4,Tool's feminine voice,"Assured release from Keenan and a different, melodically dark company, successfully replaces crunching riffage with a slightly more soothingly eccentric palate, which produces the rare rock side project release beyond major reproach. Arguably more appealing than the increasingly bloated stagnation creeping into Tool's creativity at the time."
5,Better than TOOL,"As a TOOL fan, I'm happy to say that this cd & all APC cd's (except Emotive) are better than TOOL. I have litterally worn out 3 of these cd's because it just doesn't get any better than this. I go 2-3 weeks without listening to anything else.Hard, but softer than TOOL. Beautiful sounds. Brillant writing, vocals, guitar & drums.If you like alternative music, this is a must have. 13 steps is a strong rival to this one too!"
4,Mer de Noms is good music,"I've been listening to an undisclosed FM station on the east coast over the Internet and they give airplay to many bands that aren't played here in CowTown (because every danged radio station here in CowTown in owned by Clear Channel Communications ---- CCCP1, CCCP2 and CCCP3 are our radio stations, a joke for those of you from Cold War Soviet Union). Quite often I hear music that peaks the interest and ""A Perfect Circle"" is one such group. The sound is similar to ""TooL"", but with much better guitar licks, IMO. The song I heard on the Internet broadcast was...well I forgot what it was but it was on this alblum. After listening to the 30 second snips of each song hear, I downloaded all the MP3s of ""Mer de Noms"". I don't think you'll be disappointed."
4,NOT TOOL!!!,"For those of you out there who saw Maynard's name and said, ""I have to go buy that album""! Do me, (and yourself) a favor. Stop, take a breath and repeat after me, ""A Perfect Circle is in no way shape or form related to Tool"". Trust me, if you do this you will thank me later. You must listen to this album with no expectations of what you will hear to appreciate it's beauty. Do this, and be treated to a wonderful musical experience. Buy this album!!"
5,OH MY GOD!,"If you are so lucky as to aquire this work of art, I would advise you to never let it out of your sight. Every song on this CD is a masterpiece in its own right. When it comes to music, i am very choosy with what i decide to put in my collection. But this is one of those CDs that you can just let play straight through, without programming, and you all no what I am talking about. Not one song on this CD sounds the same as another, and I find that amazing. Just imagine how much heart and mind was put into this album. If you dont own it, get it, borrow it from someone else. But be warned, you will not want to give it back."
4,ambient. beautiful.,"i first heard of APC when i saw they were opening for NIN on the american leg of the fragility tour. as such, i began listening to some mp3's of the stuff from APC.let me make this clear ahead of time: i've never had a problem with tool, other than the fact that the band seemed like they could do so much more with maynard's voice. especially after hearing him sing with tori amos..i knew maynard had to do something else. where his voice could be the instrument it was meant to be. enter A Perfect Circle. with guitars as ambient as anything played by steve caton on a tori amos album, and maynard's beautiful, passionate lyrics that are actually [gasp!] taking themselves seriously, this album keeps playing in my stereo over and over. and over. from the opening strains of ""the hollow"" until the end of ""over"", this is a journey you need to take."
5,Beautiful!,My favorite cd. Every song on here has been my favorite at one time and I have listened to all of them over and over and I never get tired of them.
4,AWSOME CD,"this is a rockin cd. it's got judith, the hollow, 3 libras. besides some weird songs like rehol?. I really suggest it a lot."
5,unmatched,"There are a few ""perfect"" cds in every genre. This is by far my favorite of the perfect cds I've found."
3,Enjoyable but not long lasting,Great vinyl but a few weeks ago it got stuck to another one of my vinyls and now the inside of the gatefold and outside are peeled off. the middle got stuck together and the artwork came peeling off. Not too happy about that.
3,Casual Fans Save Your Money,"I'll keep it simple. Judith and 3 Libras are the best songs on this album. The other tunes are decent, but don't compare to the two hits. Don't get me wrong, these guys are some serious musicians, but the rest of the album is a little on the dark side. I've listened to the album 7 or 8 times, and Judith and 3 Libras are still the only songs that I really like. If you want to listen to some hard, slow, mellow music, this album is for you. If you like to rock out, you better look elsewhere."
4,Pretty impressive.,"This is yet another side project that has erupted into something else, kind of like Belle and Sebastian bassist Stuart David's Looper project, which turned into a whole other group. Some of the songs on this album like Magdalena and Sleeping Beauty are like the soundtrack to an epic fantasy. This is definetly worth the money to buy. I like the way they stray from getting Techno-Gothic like Nine Inch Nails or Gary Numan, but stay with an alternative sound that is still very dark. This and Pearl Jam's new album are probably the best a Rock fan could ask for these days."
4,Can't Wait For Next CD,"As an oldtimer (58) I didn't think I would care for APC, however my daughter gave me the CD for Christmas. Now I can't stop playing it. This is the kind of mellow metal rock we need more of. My favorite track is Brena, with Magdalena, Orestes, Sleeping Beauty and Thinking of You also wonderful. There is a pulsating bass and underlying emotional root to this music that grabs you, and Maynard's voice is never the same on any two tracks. If you liked Beethoven, Miles Davis, Creed, Chicago and Radiohead, then you're going to love this disk. I would recommend it to all music lovers."
5,A TRULY PERFECT CIRCLE,"The reason I bought this CD is because I am an avid Tool fan. I was expecting to hear the hard, distinct lyrics and music that they are known for. But I was surprised to find that the only song that really resembled Tool was Judith. The other songs are fresh and new but still hold the hypnotic effect that Maynard is famous for. I was very impressed with the way the songs were configured on the CD. A good combination of hard and ""soft"" music. The first song on the album is especially good but suffers one bad thing, it ends much to soon. Other songs on the album also seem to have this problem. Overall, I praise this album and I await further releases from A Perfect Circle."
4,Not quite A Perfect Circle...,"But damn close to it! Overall this disk is a GREAT purchase. It bogs down in a couple of places, especially ""Rose"" & ""Over"". Other than that, these are well written, tightly performed showcases of some pretty obvious natural talent. Standout tunes are ""Orestes"", ""3 Libras"" & ""Thinking Of You"". The other high point is the packaging sleeve, which can keep you busy deciphering code for quite a while. There's more to be discovered here than just a few new songs."
5,Very nice debut.....,"Like keenan and think howerdel is cool too (his main influence is randy rhoads). Saw em live in august and they were excellent. But I save my best for paz cause she is a hottie, man she rocks up there. Well anyway it's an excellent cd and a band that is worth spending your hard earned cash on.."
4,"It's not Tool, but hey....","I am a diehard fan of Maynard James Keenan and Tool, so of course I was more than excited to hear that there would be an album out with with Keenan to hold me over until the next Tool album release. A Perfect Circle isn't quite what I was expecting (maybe I just expected Tool incognito) but it doesn't give Keenan a bad name. The drums aren't as strong and the lyrics aren't as meaningful as they are from Tool, but hey... A Perfect Circle just might have something. Maynard's voice on the album is a bit like when he did the song on the Replicants album. Overall, A Perfect Circle isn't as rich and meaningful as Tool, but they never claimed to be Tool. It was worth my money just to hear Maynard again after so long."
3,LYRICS ANYONE?,Does anyone know how i can get the lyrics to this album? i can't understand half of what he's saying. Please email me at sabian679@aol.com if you can help. Thanks.
5,Mer de Noms...,"I happen to think Tool is one of the best bands ever, so if you are looking for something similar, but slightly less metal, pick this one up. 3 Libras, Orestes, Thinking of You, and Brena are all great songs. Oh, and by the way, ""Mer de Noms"" does not mean ""Voice of the Gods"" as a previous reviewer suggested. ""Mer de Noms"" is French for ""Sea of Names."""
5,A must have album for any hard rock music fan!,"I had this album preordered a LONG time ago and I finally got it today. When oppening it I was not dissapointed at all. If you're a Tool fan, you know that Maynard has one of the best voices in all of music, and he continues his assault with this album. Don't be fooled though.....you're not buying an album that sounds a lot like Tool. They do have several songs that could easily be Tool songs, but Perfect Circle is more melodic than Tool. Dont miss out on this incredible album!"
4,Better than tool?......maybe.......maybe not.,"I have been waiting months for this to come out. I heard Maynard was forming a new band. I'm a big Tool fan and I really wanted to see if A Perfect Circle and TOOL would be twins. They are not. But You can still hear tool influances in many songs. This is not a disapointment at all. A Perfect Cirlce blends heavy, angry emotions and peaceful sounds perfectly. I can't really say if Tool or A perfect Circle is better than the other right now. I miss Tool. But in my mind A perfect circle replaces them nicely. my personal favs are ""Magdalena"" ""Judith"" and ""Hollow"" But the rest are great. Pick this up if you love Tool. You won't be dissapointed."
3,Great Music but lousy production,"Poor production dampens the impact of some interesting music on this release. The instruments seem as though they were piled on top of one another and recorded in a cavern. Cymbals are thin on top and the bass isn't deep but bloated and creates a mush in the midrange. Production is inconsistent allowing a few of the songs to sound better than others (Judith, 3 Libras). Fortunately the material is strong enough to maintain interest even though the sound is digital and sterile. I anxiously wait to see what A Perfect Circle has in store for the next round. Hopefully the production will be significantly better."
3,Pale shadow,"Unfortunately, it hasn't caught my imagination or my ears as deftly as Tool. Though it's unfair to compare bands based on their members' other projects, the reality is I was hoping for something better from Maynard."
3,Only a couple of good songs,"I'm not disapointed with this Cd, but I only really like to the song Judith, which is awesome. I prefer CD's that I can listen to the whole thing, this isn't one of them. It may grow on me, but as of now, Judith is the only one worth listening to."
2,maynard and billy's not so perfect circle,"Do you want to know what i thought when i first listend to mer de noms? I thought 'hang on, isn't this the episode when the goths turn up in dawson's creek'. I couldn't believe how much praise this shallow commercial grunge/indy album got. Diverse my arse! There is some nice music on here but it's marred by maynard james keenan just endlessy going whooooooooooooh to show of his voice. The highlight of the album has to be the fantastic rose though, a lovely lo-fi song, if only the rest of the album could be the same. If i was you, i'd avoid this album and save up for machina by the smashing pumpkins...which is how this album should of sounded. What a crushing disappointment."
2,"Tool is back, right. Wrong!","I GO TO COCONUTS WITH 20.OO IN HAND, EXCITED THAT THE LEAD SINGER OF TOOL IS BACK IN A NEW BAND. BEING A HARDCORE TOOL FAN MYSELF, I WAS REAL EXCITED TO GET THE CD. TOO BAD I WAS SADLY LET DOWN. SONG 2 IS ALL RIGHT, AND JUDITH IS GREAT, BUT THAT'S ABOUT IT. I'M SURE FANS OF THE SMASHING PUMPKINS OR SOMETHING WOULD LIKE IT, BUT IF YOU LIKE HARDCORE, OR REMEBER AETNA OR UNDERTOW, 2 OF TOOLS CDS , THIS ISNT FOR YOU."
2,Their circle is not perfect.,"Everyone else may not agree, but these songs all sound the same, and the few tunes that sound different are totally weird and don't stick in your head. The new album, Thirteenth Step, is a bit better, but not much. For a Perfect Circle fan, this is proabably a good album, but for me this wasn't a good way to spend $15."
2,"Oh, no.","This album made me lose a lot of respect for Maynard James Keenan. This is the reason REAL Tool fans had to wait so long for Lateralus to come out. This CD is just bad. There are a few good songs (""Judith, 3 Libras, Rose"")but the rest are just little 2-3 minute pop songs. None of my friends who are also Tool fans like this CD. I would bet anything that if Maynard wasn't in Tool that this CD wouldn't have even gone gold. Maynard does have a great voice, and it shines through on almost all the songs, but the music and lyrics really are bad. I highly doubt that if your really like Tool you will like this album."
2,Tool all over again...,"It seems that since Maynard is going to do music with Tool for the time being, he's found some people to be in a band to mimic Tool. I know APC fans will say APC is more than that. I don't think so. The worst is their song- diary of a mad man, I believe - where they do the ""we're going to sound like Tool ripping off the Cult and the Cure all in one song"" thing. Please, Maynard, you're incredibly talented and above having to rehash the whole Tool thing outside of Tool. It's just like David Byrne going solo and just doing the whole Talking Heads thing all over again on Uh-Oh. Wasted talent."
1,Simply.....This Sucks.,This showed a little promise but there is so much more out there that kills this. Tool sucks too. Another Keenan Over hyped cd.
4,A Perfect Album,"All the music for this album was beautifuly mixed/composed. Some songs are a little on the soft side, such as 3 Libras, but for the most part this album is hard to not listen to every once and awhile. I would reccomend you pick it up if you are just looking for some good music to relax to."
5,great hard rock album,Perfect Circle produced a really great hard rock album with mer de noms. The album has this weird feel of a gentle hard rock album. The music is hard but graceful and beautiful at the same time. James from Tool keeps his great singing voice on this album The rest of the band are really great musicians. This well definetely go down as a classic hard rock album.
5,(untitled),"when i first got the cd i was kinda disappointed, but after a while i feel in love with the smooth lyrics, soothing strings, and the awesome percussion. kinda of like tool, but still completly different. i can't wait for their next cd!"
1,This was a complete waste of time,This book was a complete waste of time and money. It appears to be a vanity book - this guy wrote about some stuff that interested him and then paid to have the book published. There are typos galore - a completely unprofessional job by the publisher.
1,A little bit better than worthless.,"This guide book contained some helpful information about Moorea & Tahiti, but not much. It's rambling and not well-organized, with numerous typos which make it appear to be not well prepared or thought out. It seems dated."
5,Practical and packed with information,"This book is a wonderful resource for simple ways to save money on your landscape projects. I highly recommend it for all gardeners and landscapers. It's unlike other garden books that just show pretty pictures and give the same old generic information. This book gives you straightforward advice on how to plan your garden, propagate your own plants with minimal effort and recycle materials for mulch. Everything in this book is about economy of time and money."
5,check this out!,"A lovely CD from Elena. Beautifully sung, played, and presented. A mixture of unexpected versions of standards and some great new songs. Featuring superb musicians from around the world and great arrangements by the core of the band -Elena, Jerome Davies (bass) and Mirek Linka (guitar). Features a gorgeous re-working (by bassist Jerome Davies) of You Go To My Head featuring Mexican born Mark Aanderud on Piano."
5,Just what was needed,"We recently moved to the Tucson area. Although we have a great GPS, we were having trouble planning & coordinating our trips. We've used this awesome, detailed map to jot down which stores/places are where so we can combine our trips and plan things our. It's been a huge help around detours too!!"
3,"Interesting and Plot-Driven, but a Little Cheesy","I liked the idea and energy of this book. It never bored me, but I do feel the author fell prey to an easy, pat, aging-A.A. ending to write her way out of this book. I also think she romantically overstated the revolutionary power of sex and didn't explore in depth enough the many, many other reasons why women make the choices they do. That said, the characters were lively and intriguing, if one dimensional in motivation at times."
2,Not what I expected,Its long and drawn out. I lost my interest within the first 4 chapters. The author has an awesome journey but I can't see myself being able to become that into elements.
4,Take The Sting (and Slip) Out of Winter,"OK, very little we can do about the sting of winter here in Chicago, but Safe Paw has definitely helped preserve our wooden decks and the paws of our building's canine residents. Highly recommend this product."
1,Will kill your lawn,"I used this product over the winter. I used very little and it ended up killing my lawn and ground cover. If you have a lawn orplants near your drive or sidewalk- DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT. It killed teh lawn so completely, I wonder what the effect is on animal paws?"
2,Didn't seem very effective,"I live in an area where the ice/snow buildup is seldom more than an inch or two. We do experience periods of several days where the temperature is never above freezing. During that time, I did not see any melting action at all. The granules provide some traction on outdoor stairs, but the ice was still there, not melted and I was using generous amounts. At this price, I think there are better more cost effective alternatives which are also pet-friendly. Ace Hardware has their own brand of ice-melter which says it is pet-friendly. I tried some and it works better for me, and is definitely much cheaper"
1,Caution when using this Product,"Buyer beware when using safepaw. It is NOT SAFE on your cement driveway or stairs! We used a very small amount on our walkway and cement steps. The next day, our cement steps began to crack and flake, causing serious damage. We documented and sent a complaint to the manufacturer, which was responded to with denial of any responsibility."
1,Pros and Cons,"I bought some of this rather pricey stuff to see if it would make my poor old dog's feet less uncomfortable in the winter. So far so good, but I have a list of pros and cons about it.Pros:Ostensibly safe for your pets.Lots of websites say it's safe (while also taking advertising from Safe Paw).Pleasant blue color looks like ""Nerds"" candy, which is tasty.Same blue color makes snow look like a Wild Raspberry-flavored Sno Cone; also tasty.If you're trying to impress a pet-lover in a wintry environment s/he might think you're sweet for buying it for her/him.Cons:Probably doesn't taste as good as it looks.Part of the packaging uses ""effect"" where it should have used ""affect.""Doesn't melt ice.Verdict:Yeah, it's safe for paws. Not so much for hips, since my dog keeps falling down on the ice it's totally ineffective at melting.Since the ice melting seems to be its primary purpose, it's really not worth buying."
1,Caution- This will kill your lawn,"I used this product over an Illinois winter. Although we got a great deal of snow and Ice I used it very sparingly (not even an full container over the entire winter). In the spring I realized that it had killed the lawn in all areas adjacent to where it was used. Watering did nothing to revive the dead lawn and I ended up replacing it with sod. The package claims that it is safe for lawns.The product is so destructive to plants, it makes me wonder what harmful effects it may have on animals."
3,"Good Concept, but Long","It doesn't seem like there are many books to introduce children to the concept of strangers, despite how important the topic is. Anyway, I thought I'd give this book a chance since my son was familiar with Winnie the Pooh and his friends. I agree with other reviewers that is is somewhat long of a story, but not as wordy as the Bernstein Bear's book on strangers. It's nicely written. The topic is addressed without causing excessive fear."
4,Some answers to the future of work.,"Although this book is nearly a decade old, written about the American experience and for an American audience, the ideas and concepts are applicable to anywhere is the world where middle management is being squeezed out due the changes taking place in the workplace. As we move from an industrial society to an informational society and from a workforce that needs to be managed and controlled to a workforce that is managing and applying knowledge, the need for traditional middle managers is rapidly dissappearing. What is needed are creative and innovative leaders and free-agents who can spearhead and lead fellow colleagues to add value to create a profit for stakeholders.This needs a completely new vision, mindset and approach to work. This book provides some interesting ideas and concepts if you think deep as you read the chapters."
1,Fun but flawed,My kids 10 and 11 loved the games.However we played it twice and the software now will not work. Just sits at Loading regardless of what I do.What a ripoff.
1,Dumb,This game is not good. The motion capture is poor. The games are not thought out and are just thrown in at the last second. Bye!
1,AMAZING!,"He was on his way to being one of the best comics that ever lived. Unfortunately, his serious attempt at pop music was just as comical, in a ""we're laughing at you, not with you"" sort of way. Rick James was at his coked out best on this album which I'm sure didn't help things. I have the vinyl ""Party all the Time"" single and I break it out for a chuckle every once in a while. The corny drum machine beats, Eddie's ""Oooooh oooh OOOooohs!"" and his beyond tacky leather jump suit that grace the cover enough to make anyone double over in hysterical laughter."
5,Good ole country,Great service. Why do I have to write more words? Words. Words. Words. Words. Words. Words.Words. Words. Words. Words. Words.
2,Hank Jr. Download,Had a big problem with downloading this item. Had to find the file in My Music then download the songs individually into iTUNES. The music is fine. It was the process.
4,Another perspective,"Contrary to the other reviewer, I had no problems with the recording quality -- I was modestly impressed with it. There are better performances of the Scheherazade, no doubt, but for the dirt-cheap price Amadis is asking, this is well worth the purchase. The solo violin is very professional and plays with a very technical skill that isn't often heard when performing Rimsky. It isn't particulary touching, nor is it probably suitable for the piece, but it is a different take. Well performed, good quality, great price: go for it."
3,book did not help me get a better grade.,"My test was much different. It had been altered for the job, mostly filing numbers and addresses. No vocab at all, no math at all, etc."
3,Using R statistics,It took three weeks for me to receive the book after the order and whe I got it it look extremely used up. It has all the pages so far but I expected the book to be in better conditions.
5,Often overlooked but solid title,"This book doesn't show up under most listings for books about R, but it should. It's a very solid introduction to using R -- including installation, configuration, and some progrmaming -- for basic statistical work. My only complaint is that it wasn't quite comprehensive enough -- not enough examples were given and not enough discussion on important functions and parameters were present. Also, the index is atrocious.I would recommend it as a good book to get going, but for in depth work you'll be referring to the HTML help a lot."
2,Poorly organized and frustrating,"In an introductory book, it is really important to present concepts in order. This book fails on this count. On more than one occasion, a concept (e.g., ""trimmed mean"") or a function (e.g., ""range(x)"") is mentioned without being defined, only to be presented as new later on. This is very frustrating and prevents a new student from working through the book fast. As some other reviewers remarked, the index is a complete disaster, which only makes this worse. It is nice that the book comes with a package of problems. The package lacks answers to most of these problems, though, so one can't check progress easily.Look elsewhere."
3,not my favorite book,"This is my textbook for an introductory biostats course. The reason why the teacher picked this book is because the software, R, is free. I find that if I use this as an instruction manual to use R, it's okay. However, as a statistics book, I find it difficult to follow and the explanations are not as clear as some of the other books on the market (e.g. the Dawson book called ""Basic and Clinical Biostatistics"" which is much more palatable)"
3,"A good start, could use some editing","First, I only made it through about half of this book before being pulled in other directions, so with that in mind...This is a good start if your new to both R and statistics in general. It contains plenty of examples that keep things interesting and relevant. To that end it excels.On the other hand, it falls short in its editing quality. Its one of those books where you'll get half-way through, and still feel confused about syntax and functions that have already been covered. Then going back, you'll find it difficult to re-trace exactly where particular peices were covered.Its not bad, but if I were to start again, I'd giveThe Art of R Programming: A Tour of Statistical Software Designa shot - it seems more organized towards teaching the fundamentals of R in a way that will serve as both a gentle introduction and future reference. (Note I haven't read it, just my best guess from skimming toc)."
1,Horrible book for an intro to R,"HORRIBLE BOOK - R is already such a frustrating program, so if you want to make your life worse, buy Verzani. The worst thing about Verzani is that you can't tell what chapter you're in when you are using the book - there are no chapter headings next to the page numbers! You are working on something in R and need help with code, but first you have to hunt for 30 minutes though Verzani to find it! Most of the time it isn't even worth it - the author often presents the wrong way to program first to show you how NOT to do it, which is completely useless because the reader doesn't know how to do anything in the first place! The index is horrible, and the topics are all out of order. Horrible reference for an already extremely frustrating computer program. I just sold my copy for a loss of $6.00 on Amazon, and I wish the poor buyer the best as he tries to make sense of the tangled mess known as VERZANI."
4,Useful & Course-Specific,"Length:: 0:56 MinsThis is me explaining why I would so highly recommend ""Using R for Introductory Statistics"" for college courses requiring such a text."
1,this is a rebranded product,"just so you know, this is a re-brand at a higher price. some companies do this so it is harder to find a similar product else where at a lower price by not giving you the original name to search for. here's the original: http://www.amazon.com/Stack-On-PR-23-23-Inch-Professional-Multi-Purpose/dp/B000I0WL5Y/ref=sr_1_272?s=power-hand-tools&ie=UTF8&qid=1351806849&sr=1-272"

3,Fire!?,We just had one of these blow up on us. It was glowing like a xmas tree until we unplugged it. If it was a few hours earlier and no one was around we could have had a serious office fire.I cant seem to find any recall notice. I sure hope it was an isolated incident.

4,good but not great,"If you;ve heard the first cd in the trilogy, you'll be expecting greatness. However, Klayton's influence, although it can be heard without trying, is pushed more to the background than most people looking for this cd would like. It's still worth owning, especially for the true fan, but a far cry from Musical Conjurings (system 1)."
5,"practical, highly informed advice in a critical area","Information literacy instruction is often regarded as critical to the survival of libraries as we know them in academia. Most academic librarians seemed to have grasped this and taken up the cause of improving their instructional practices, but this is the first book-length treatment of the factors necessary to motivate students to want to learn the concepts. Logically-organized and full of useful examples, this book clearly reflects the authors' teaching experiences in a way that others will find applicable both theoretically and in practice."
4,Danceable Cynicism,"I agree with many of the other reviews here: this is a fine, underappreciated album. Carly Simon's vocals are tough and appropriately aggressive. There is a darkness at work beneath the 80s sheen and the lyrics are witty and adult. Why do so many people take ""Interview"" at face value? Did they not listen to the whole song? Same with ""Spoiled Girl."" Simon is COMMENTING on the dangers of narcissism, not indulging in it. The mid-80s was a bleak time, I think, but Carly Simon filtered all the bombast into something really intriguing."
3,This is a terriffic release by Carly,"I like this release because it's a damn good record. She injected herself with a hot, pop/rock/dance sound that I thought was great for her. I'm in my 20's and I really appreciated this offering from her when it came out back in 1985 (I was in the 6th grade). It had Carly's signature stamp while reminding us she could keep up with the latest trends in pop. I'm so glad Carly Simon refused to jump into that boring ""nostalgic rut"" that her ex-husband and other peers jumped into when the 70's ended."
3,Once Again A Record Company Bloop,"Carly Simon has always had the worst track records since the 70's of having record label's choose a single. ""Spoiled Girl"" is a prime example. You must remember, this album is the one before her return to mainstream with ""Coming Around Again"". So there is lot's of good material here. 'Anyone But Me"" is a major standout, which alone, is worth the price of this album. Other winners are -'Come Back Home', ""Can't Give it Up' and ""Make me Feel Something"". ""The Wives are in Con."" is almost like a broadway show tune and a fun example of Simon's wry humor. One of her more accessible and mainstream albums, but Epic fell short here- which prompted Simon's trek to Arista."
4,Carly in an experimental mode,"This album finds Carly in an experimental mode, whether it was her choice or the record company's isn't clear. Each song was produced by someone different and it is quite evident; the songs are very different sounding, although Carly had a hand in writing most of them. I thought it was quite daring when the record first came out, but I still like the songs, especially the sexy ""Can't Give It Up"" and ""Anyone But Me"". I love Carly when she sings her own back-up, as on ""Anyone But Me"" & ""Make Me Feel Something"". Carly's wit comes through on ""Wives"" & ""Black Honeymoon"", which finds Carly biding her time until she finds someone new so she can then leave her unfaithful lover. Too bad this album was not more successful when it was released; perhaps Carly may have stuck with the experimental methods and produced who-knows-what; not that her output since has been anything but stellar."
4,"Elizabeth Van Lew: Southern Belle, Union Spy (People in Focu","This book was very informational. This book was also a great source to learn more about the Civil War. Not only did it focus on Van Lew, it also contains a plump amount of information on the Civil War. I enjoyed reading it and learning about a person of the Civil war that made a significant effect on the war, but not taught it text books. I wish there had been more about her personal life, but a lack of source of her personal life could be reasoning for this. It was also interesting that the last chapter explains how the information about Ezilabeth Van Lew has been found an saved over the years. I recommend this book to anyoe who enjoys reading about the Civil War and women of earlier eras."
1,I can't believe it....,"....another re-packaging of previously released material from John Coltrane. Wow! this is great. I really needed to hear these songs that I already have on other Coltrane CDs.Give me a break, guys!! This is yet another marketing ploy to make money off the Coltrane name. Show Impulse and the Coltrane estate that you are not going to be duped by them and DO NOT purchase this CD.Why can't we get some fresh stuff that hasn't been released yet. There's got to be some unreleased material, live shows, or something in the vault. Please..."
1,Get with the program Targus,"I have now bought 2 of these and both of them failed. After I first plugged them in they worked just fine. But, after a short time, they both stopped working. And like the other poster I could still see the light on the hub but nothing would work when plugged in to it. I'm very disappointed in Targus since this is obviously an issue that they must know about but put the product out anyways. They should reimburse me for gas money given that I had to drive back to the Office Depot twice now for this piece of junk!"
1,Totally disappointed!!,"The hub stopped responeding when connected to usb port, although its led lightens , i bought it just since 2 months, it is totally waste for money"
3,Typo,"This isn't a review but a correction for Amazon.com. The song ""Lonely Boy"" was recorded by Andrew Gold, not Paper Lace. Nonetheless, the album looks like a nice collection of music from that era."
2,Cheap Product,Do not purchase this product. Its thin and looks cheap. Looks better online. You can get a better made leather belt at Men's Wearhouse on sale for $19.99. I do not recommend this product.
2,cheap belt,Very cheap quality but I guess that is what you get when you do not pay that much for a belt
5,"Beautiful Bracelet, Beautiful Price","The Labradorite Bracelet by ""Cute Stretchy Gems"" is predominately green and white in a well polished, beautiful design. It will fit a 7"" wrist comfortably."
5,Good for everyone,"I love stretching and have always found it relaxing. My husband on the other had has to work at his flexibility. My daughter is young and still carefree. But understanding and applying yoga techniques to maximize your body's energy is absolutely critical regardless of age, background or current ability.Tracy Piercy, Author of Enlightened Wealth"
5,Yoga Chi for Me,I'm new to yoga and this DVD seems to be an easy start. Suzanne takes time so that it's not difficult to follow her. I'm very comfortable with learning with her.
2,Doesn't look to be 14 gauge,"I was sold on the 100' length, 14 gauge, and price. The wire doesn't appear to be 14 gauge at all. More like 16 gauge or smaller. I regretted buying this after I saw that Lowes had RCA 100' 14 gauge at about the same price without the shipping cost."
2,This stuff is definitely NOT 14 gauge wire,"Although it is clearly marked 14AWG on the spool, this wire looks just like plain old 18 gauge lamp cord. I have a spool of of 16 gauge wire that is substantially thicker (the actual wire also, not just the plastic jacket). I didn't return it because of the hassle, and I was impatient to wire my sound system. Live and learn. My advice is to buy speaker wire at your local store, even if it costs a few bucks more, because you can actually check it before you fork over your hard-earned $$$."
2,Doesn't look like 14 Gauge to me either,"I agree with the other reviewer, it doesn't look like 14 gauge either.The wire was a pain to strip because the strands inside the cable are very thin.And I should also mention that the roll I received was a putrid purple color, so don't count on it looking anything like the picture."
2,not happy :-(,"i really should have read the reviews on this before purchasing, usually i do but i figured its 14 gauge, and 14 gauge is 14 gauge, but this did not feel or look like 14 gauge to me, i bought 16 gauge at best buy that seemed way better then this, i ended up getting some 14 gauge at home depot for $25 100' and love it. and also it does not look anything like the photo."
1,Not 14AWG Wire,Do not buy this wire. It's not 14AWG. It's 16AWG at best. Amazon should stop selling this item.
3,Backup wire,it is very thin and gets twisted- it also gets the job done - cheap and good to keep close by incase i need wire.
2,14 gague ???,I've seen 18 gauge wire thicker then this so called 14 gauge wire. Someone is walking around laughing at me.
1,FRAUD! DO NOT BUY! This is NOT 14 Gauge wire. It is thinner.,This wire is NOT 14 Gauge. do not buy it unless you want to get ripped off. it isn't even close. This Wire is actually THINNER than even 16 Gauge. Don't waste your money on this product
3,Not realy 14 Gauge,"The wire works well and the price is good, but the real gauge is about 16 gauge or less, and the length is less than 100 feet."
2,Incorrect Gauge,"They advertise that it is 14 gauge speaker wire, but in reality it is close to 18 gauge. Came in on time."
2,"It worked, but not sure I'd buy again","I didn't look closely at the wire gauge - maybe I should have after reading the other reviews. I used this to run new speaker wire through my car for a more powerful system.When running wires through a car - into the doors, under the carpet, through seates, etc., it's important to run lengths of wire without splices, in my opinion. Twice when I was pulling this wire through, I found unexpected ""ends"" in the middle of the spool. At first I thought I'd done something stupid like cut the wrong side of the wire, but then it happened again. It's like leftover wire (three sections) were spooled up and sold. Seemed like ok wire, but this was unusual."
5,Nice gauge speaker wire,This is a nice medium gauge speaker wire; not too flimsy and not too bulky. Product is excellent and has a red stripe down the side of one wire to identify it on the other end.
1,Much thinner than other wire the same gauge,I was quite surprised when I opened the box to find out how thin the wire is. I went to radio shack and bought the same gauge wire and it was much heavier.
2,"same case, different cd","The cd I ordered had only about 14 songs. Songs I wanted. The cd I received had the same cover but it has 25 songs that are early ones I don't like, never heard of. I have to wade through these songs to get to the ones I like and then one of the main songs I ordered the cd for, isn't on this one. It's like bait and switch. The case was cracked, too. Didn't contact the seller because it's so much trouble to deal with return, paying shipping on their mistake, and all that."
4,A good read,"I've read several of Barr's books, not in the order of publication. The more recent books have become so dark and violent that I was pleased to find that Endangered Species relied more on character and plot than sheer evil (as in High Country). The marijuana burning incident sounded a bit far-fetched to me, but it was an interlude of humor. The parallel plot about Frederick and Molly was a bit distracting, but it did help to fill in some of Anna's personal history. It was refreshing to read a book in which the people who are attracted to each other don't immediately fall into bed but resist temptation to an involvement that could be damaging to others."
3,Readable but not a 'must'.,"I like the Anna Pigeon series by Nevada Barr and think they get better with her more recent books. This one was readable but by the end of the book, I wasn't sure who was who in the cast of characters...I usually read books pretty fast (a day or two), but this one dragged on and I finished it just to get it over with."
5,Great addition to her series of adventures for Anna Pidgeon,"Well - Nevada Barr has done it again. Written a smashing good book that makes you want to stay up bleary-eyed to the final page. I have not been disappointed yet in her books. She can spin a yarn in the most interesting and enchanting places. Her summers with the rangers have served her and consequently, us very well. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good mystery novel that keeps you in suspense up to the final line on the final page"
3,Fairly good book,"As I work my way through Nevada Barr's Ana Pigeon series, I am impressed at how each setting plays a major role in the story. This is no exception- very good book with interesting characters and typical plot."
4,good read,This is an area I have not explored much so put it on my list of parks to visit. Love the series and revisiting the national parks in a new light. Anna Pigeon is a formidable ranger!
2,Average Detective Fiction,"Supposed to be a whodunnit, and even a whodunwhat, but for me it was a whocareswhatorwho, which ended with an ending an TV movie afficianado would be bored of by now. However, the hero is a likeable middle aged woman who rolls up her sleeves, which makes a change from the usual sex obsessed silicon enhanced stereotypes that wander the pages of most mass market fiction, so that is a pleasant change."
3,Nevada Barr Lost Me On This One,"I usually find her books exciting and interesting. I am very impressed with her knowledge - but on this one she fell flat on her face in the area of research. At the beginning of Chapter 26, she writes: ""Dot and Mona were vintage World War II stock: B-52's, cigarettes, red lipstick. And Morse code."" B-52's in World War II? No way. Big mistake! Ms. Barr! Check your facts."
3,Character gender change is stumbling block for audio edition,"I always look forward to new Nevada Barr books. The printed edition of this title was no disappointment and would have rated higher than the level I gave the audio edition. What I don't understand is why the murderer was one gender in the printed edition -- but appears as another gender in the audio edition. This difference involves not just changes in pronouns, but actual changes in the vocal presentation of descriptions, character and events. Abridgement is one thing to endure -- this is something else!"
2,"great story, but not a great reader","I'm a fan of Nevada Barr and enjoyed the plot of this book, but Cindy Williams makes this one hard to listen too. She reads like she is racing to the end in a performance with all the passion and variety of a lump of coal. Buy the book; it is an engaging story. But wait for an unabridged audio version read by Barbara Rosenblat."
5,Hard to put down,"I always enjoy Nevada Barr's books and this one did not disappoint. I was fully involved in the story and while her main character Anna Pigeon, prefers her life in the parks to a full time relationship with someone, there is just enough personal story to make her human. There is suspense and tension throughout and while I suspected who the killer was, I was content to let the author lead me to the conclusion."
3,"Marking time between ""Firestorm"" and ""Deep South""","This story's a bit of a mess. There are too many characters to keep straight, none of the great set pieces such as the motorboat chase in ""A Superior Death,"" and a distinctly ""who cares"" attitude about the eventual unmasking of the villain. Just as Cumberland Island is a backwater in the National Park System, this book is a backwater in the Anna Pigeon series. Anna spends the story trying to figure out what to do about a difficult personal relationship, and Barr spends it as a combination of revisiting old ground (fire fighting) and gearing up for a serious foray into the southern parks. Read ""Firestorm"" for a better story of fire fighting, and skip to ""Deep South"" for a better-developed take on the southern parks. Still, even a ho-hum Anna Pigeon mystery is good enough to keep the pages turning."
4,"Anna goes skinny dippin, cuts her hair, and loses her ""Ex.""","Anna is in the south again - but this time on one of the islands off the coast of Georgia. And she's not 'wrastlin' gators this time, it's turtles instead. There's a plane crash, Bambi (real name, Flicka), cannibus (marijuana), and more. She's still contemplating moving to Chicago to be with the distant Frederick, but that possibility seems to always be on the backburner. As usual, Nevada fights the good fight, goes skinny dipping, gets her hair cut, and is finally free of her ex-husband (in a hilarious manner), while discovering the the secrets of Cumberland Island's murders."
1,Amazingly inept attempt at adventure,"Beneath all the metaphors, similes, and unendingly long and unnecessarily descriptive passages, there is a story, but if you don't die of boredom trying to find it, you will surely lose any sense of continuity. Ms. Barr should take a lesson on how to tell a story with wit and purpose from Patricia Cornwell, who can bring life to characters and impart needed historical perspectives at the same time. After reading reviews of this author, I borrowed three of her latest books, this being the first I read. I doubt I'll bother with the other two. A total letdown, and I am a very patient reader with less than excellent authors. Pass this up and get the Kay Scarpetta books instead!"
4,a lot of romaji,"I have to say that I was looking for a book with no romaji. I've already learnt hiragana and katakana, and my japanese teacher has been encourage me to no use romaji, in her class romaji is never used. But I get it, a book which says ""from Zero!"" may use romaji to introduce japanese to first learners, but I expected the book would introduce hiragana first and quick. But, looking in a more possitive way, I started to fill every romaji word to kana, and it's a little of practice (why not?). Also, the books has a lot of cultural tips, grammar and commmon usage."
2,An ok book,"I really enjoy this book a writing practice but to learn Japanese from nothing it isn't that good for. First, it doesn't give you all the pronunciations that you need to know Japanese(ie desu is pronunced deh-sue and dess depending on how it's being used),it just gives you the very basic of the basics. Second, to learn Japanese you need to know how it sounds and how to speak it. It would be a great series if these two things were changed."
5,"If you're a beginner, this is the product to get!","I purchased this product with high hopes from all the reviews that I read. I did not realize how amazing it truely is. Coming from someone who had NO knowledge about the Japanese language, it is definitely useful and easy. I highly reccommend this product to anyone who is wanting to learn Japanese. Japanese From Zero! is not only a useful tool to learn grammar, but it will also teach you hiragana, katagana and kanji as well. If you're a bit skeptical about it don't be! My husband and I use this and it is truely amazing as I keep on stating."
3,kids not a fan of immersion,"This Spanish video is OK, and studies do show that immersion in the best way to learn a language, but my kids just don't seem to pick it up this way, they seem to do much better with Spanish/Engish translation videos. Don't think I would buy another immersion video."
5,A medical necessity,At work we call the Taber's the nurses bible. You just really can't do without one.
5,Great Merchant,"Fast Delivery, Item as described & emails back...A+ service & Trustworthy-that's important on Amazon..would use again..jcl"
5,Must have!!,This is a must have for anyone in nursing or medical assisting. The indices are loaded with all kinds of great information all at your fingertips. Would highly recommend to anyone.
4,text book review,"The dictionary explains in detail diagnosis, treatment, etc of various illnesses and has been helpful in my studies."
5,Great medical reference book,"I used one of these at my job and liked it so well that I bought one for myself when I retired. It will answer pretty much any question you have about ailments, treatments, etc."
4,Tabers Dictationary,It was like brand new. Excellant! the book can as expected.It will be perfect for my niece studying medicine now.
5,"Newest, Most Pages Medical Dictionary","The 20th edition is a new update to this well known book. It is updated with more than 8,400 new terms or revised definitions, for a total of 56,000 entries. Some 700 illustrations, 500 in color, expand and clarify particular points. Finally it includes a free six month subscription to Taber's online 3.0 which has these same 56,000 definitions along with features like searching and audio pronunciation for about 2,500 terms.Obviously this book has to be compared with Stedman's. Here's the way I see it:Taber's is bigger - 2788 pages vs. 2098 pagesTaber's is more current - Published in 2005 rather than in 2000Stedman's has more definitions - 102,000 entries vs. 56,000 - With more pages and fewer definitions, Tabor's has more on each definition.Stedman's is less expensiveExciting reading - you gotta be kidding."
5,Medical Dictionary,"This is an investment in your education; it is well-written, concise and contains a wealth of knowledge as a reference."
5,Awesome service!,Recieved my Medical Dictionary in brand new condition. Shipping was exeptionally faster then expected especially during the Christmas season. Awesome service! I'd use it over and over again to purchase my books.
3,Everybody's gotta have one.....,"This is your average, run of the mill Medical Dictionary. It does what it's supposed to do. It is a medical reference book that we all need when we work in the field (nurse, doctor, etc)."
1,"Tabers Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary, 20th ed.","Am in the process of returning the book because it is missing pages 1677 through 1708. The wierd thing is that it doesn't look like those pages were removed; instead, it appears as if the book was made without the them; the binding looks tight and all. Maybe the book is super rare -- like a coin with a minting flaw.... Does anyone else have a copy of the 20th edition with those pages, or others, missing?PS. The book is absolutely terrific otherwise.Taber's Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary (Thumb Index)"
3,I don't love it,"I bought this book thinking it would be like an all inlcusive glossary in a medical/anatomy/physiology textbook. It was not this way at all. It does have useful information in it, but I think this is more geared toward people who are actually applying it to medicine instead of using it for studies. I am still a student so I hope it's going to come in very handy someday!"
5,Taber's Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary,"I haven't received it yet, so can't comment on this edition. I have used other editions and have found them to be invaluable."
4,Beautiful instrument for your money,"Of course it is obviously manufactured.Cons: The back is made of 4 combined pieces instead of traditional 2 pieces, the bridge is a little soft, the fine tuners don't feel too study, and there is knot in the wood of the neck for mine.Pros: One of the best beginner instruments around. Not only was it already strung with the bridge attached, they even sent us spare strings (which we ended up needing) and an extra bridge with the package. Many experienced violin players have looked at it and said that it was a fine new instrument. No cut backs, no plastic. The entire violin is wood and a slight bit of metal. It resonates like a violin should and everything is fine and dandy.I'd give it a 4.5, but I'll round down to 4 stars because if you really tried you could probably find a decent used violin for less. (and with violins, if they are treated well, they get BETTER with age)"
1,Doesn't maintain tuning and only produces scratchy sound,"Upon opening the case, this violin, bought for our son, does not feel like a toy. We soon discovered, however, that the tuning pegs are extremely poorly designed and manufactured. They fail to maintain tuning for any longer than half a minute. The peg and hole system is so loose and imprecise that we could actually see the pegs unspinning all by themselves as the strings were tightened--even after trying repeatedly to push the pegs further into the holes. Another major noticeable flaw is the impossibility of playing any decent, clean violin sound, no matter how much rosin we passed on the bow, which was properly tightened (my wife is a former violin player and attested to this). With tuning pegs that seem to belong to a cheap toy and do not maintain any tuning whatsoever and with a bow that only produced scratchy sound instead of clean musical notes, we believe this product needs to improve such flaws prior to being offered in the market."
5,Rosewood Violin,"Purchased as a gift for Christmas, this violin looked exactly as pictured and described on the web site. It arrived within one week as predicted and in good shape. It appears to be high enough quality for the money paid and came with everything needed for a beginner to get started. I especially liked how this one came with a bit of a hard case to protect the instrument. The wood is a nice color and finish. I would recommend it."
4,very good violin for you money,"I bought my new violin on 12/29/2006, I received on 01/03/2007, with one day off new year day, that fast then I expected. the violin delivery in very good condition, expect G & D strings lose and can not find production document, I think everything is ""OK"", the bow and violin coombine very good sound, compaired with my old one bought on 1983 with $250 , You will feel you are luck to find one. (the bow is very good)"
2,Impossible to tune,the pegs keep sliding...I've tried different methods to keep them where i want but no luck..
4,did i get ripped off?,"ok so i ordered this a long time ago.. but i JUST now discovered that i think i got the wrong item.. there are big differences in my item.. in the inside of the violin it says ""Oppela"" instead of ""Cecilio"" the case is BLUE same with the inside and the accessories it comes with are different as well. the rosin loks completely different and is in a square shape. also instead of the chin rest and other things being black, mine is brown. everything looked alot more cheaper than the pictures. did i get ripped off? did anyone else get this item like this? plz help! i dont know wether to put 1 star bcus im still ok with the item i got.. tho im not sure its the right one"
3,Violine purchase,"The violin itself would be good for a person just learning, but by using the mute it is much better. The case is fantastic. I didn't expect the high quality and protection it provides the violin. The bow has already lost a couple of hairs."
1,NOT WORTH IT,"Not worth the money. The bow was bent, the strings not good. looked good in pictures, but when the violin arrived, my 12 year old was disappointed."
2,Bought it from a company through Amazon.. Seller is ridiculous,"This product might be a great buy for a beginner --- but the seller, ToysNgamesEtc, sent my fiance a 1/4 instead of a 4/4, the bow had hair hanging off of it, and didn't even include the extra set of strings listed on the profile! They wont take it back because they don't accept returned items that were originally a new product that has been opened by the customer, WTF right? Not to mention, it was sent USPS, 7lbs, USPS -_-. I imagine a good bit of the damn price was shipping and handling for the company. We looked on a few other sites after already buying this violin here, and found that we could have instead of paying $110, only paid $80. I wish we hadn't of purchased from this company called ToysNgamesEtc. Luckily, my dad is going to buy my fiance a new violin and is going to see if one of my younger siblings wants to learn with this one."
3,It's decent but don't expect a Stradivarius,"If you just need something for starting out, this is a decent model. Mine unfortunately has a warped scroll, but I'm not overly upset as I knew I would be getting a cheap quality instrument. The main reason I bought this cheap student violin was to learn the fingering. It's a nice violin though and if it breaks you're not out a ton of cash. If you're serious about learning the violin, you might want to invest in a move expensive one, but if you're just beginning to tinker like me, this is a cheap violin."
2,Not well made.,"While the wood of the violin is nicely made. I was upset with how poorly the strings & pegs are made. I'm returning it because the pegs do not stay in place. I even tried to restring it a few times. No luck. The neck rest is nice though, along with the case. If the pegs stayed put, this would be a great begging-er violin. Guess I will have to look for another Violin to buy."
1,Not Good At All,"I purchased this and another brand violin at the same time. This one is terrible. I've had to have it repaired multiple times, the bridge keeps falling out and the d string will not stay in tune. The other I purchased ( for the same price ) is wonderful. I would not recommend this to anyone. If I could give it negative stars I would."
4,sequel to Mansfield Park,"Mrs. Norris and Maria settle in a rural area near a widowed clergyman who stays shut up in his study, and his many daughters. Maria gets one of the youngest involved in mischief and near ruin, the oldest worries that she will never get the others respectibly settled enough to have a life and romance of her own, and Mrs Norris busybodily tells everyone else how to manage. As Jane Austen sequels go (most of which are awful) this one is reasonably good. I've read it a few times, and it has a humorous twist involving mrs norris at the end."
2,Slow and preachy,"This book started off with great possibility, then slowed to a crawl. In the end it became nothing more than an advertisement for abstinence until marriage. The characters had external quirks and lots of them (some very annoying, like the overweight black woman who ends almost every sentence with ""uh-huh"") but their inner lives were flat, uni-dimensional, caricatures of godly Christians. The biggest conflict in the book was the narrator arguing himself out of more than a few kisses with his new girlfriend (who of course thanks him for really respecting her enough not to kiss her). Unless you are a Christian fundamentalist who opposes anything that might challenge your world view you can do much better than this."
3,"Not as good as ""Flabbergasted""","""A Delirious Summer"" is the story of Neil, language teacher on furlough. Many characters from ""Flabbergated"" are a part of this story but this one just doesn't resonate within me as its predecessor did. Once again, Andrew Peterson's reading is magnificent... just wish the story was better!"
3,Dangerously Slow ... But Worth it in the end,"I've got to say it took me forever to get into this book. I just finished it 30 seconds ago ... and I'm glad the long journey has come to an end. Usually I am so engrossed in a book I can't put it down ... this one I had to force myself to keep reading. But I finished it ... it kept calling me back, I wanted to know the end and I'm glad I did. This book had some laugh out loud parts to it ... and it had a surprising depth, that you wouldn't expect from such a sleeper of a book.I'm a little wary at starting Lost in Rooville ... but hopefully it will surprise me like A Delirious Summer did."
1,Very Poorly Written,"This book was slow moving, lacked detail, had no plot, and was in general dull. It was a waste of my time to read and I cannot believe that someone actually published it."
1,One of the worst books I've ever read,"Seriously....I rarely talk badly about any book (or anybody for that reason) but I feel I have a social obligation to warn others about this book. It is not only bad, it's painfully horrible. The begining of the book is so bad that you have to read a few chapters to see if there is some bad joke involved. You have to believe that there is some twist involved or else the book would have never been published. But, unfortunately, there is not twist. Just a horrible, boring, dreadful, waste of time."
5,Mountains of fun,"This is an awesome set for the price. It's tool set leaves little to be desired. This could be the only set you need, unless you are a playdough enthusiast, in which case, the dough color selection alone is worth the price. My 4 year old loved it!! (My 10 and 13 year olds won't admit it, but they did too)The only reason I gave 4 stars for durability,is because playdough by its very nature is not a durable toy, unless you take a lot better care of it than my kids do. But the tools will last a lifetime under normal use, and the dough is soft and of good quality"
3,"Play Doh, Play Doh everywhere. . . .","For the love of all that is good and holy, who needs this much Play Doh? You have to admit that no human being needs to be in possession of this much Play Doh at one time. If you buy this for your kid, he may go into Play Doh overload. When I was a kid, you thought you were cool if you got the Play Doh set with the barber chair - - or perhaps the McDonald's set. Now in order to compete, must we have the Play Doh set in several dozen fashion colors??"
2,Great price. Poor quality,"I purchased two sword stands recently and I was extremely happy with how quick they arrived. However, once I removed them from the box I found the wood to be thin and of poor quality. After assembling the first stand I noticed the wood was beginning to crack. I decided to assemble the second stand with similar results. I was unable to use either stand due to the poor quality. I would not recommend purchasing these stands."
5,reek daddy you are a genius man..............,"check this out, people you see the track listing so i wont make 1 so other than that please do yourself a favor and pick this comp up. damn reek daddy has put together 14 tracks of pure greatness, cuddy bang with psd, dubee, reek and mac mall does damage and wreckless ey-xl-me is the bomb. i got this cd when it was .51 cents so damn i got a steal of classic banging bay area music. cop it and enjoy like i have. peace."
3,Maybe it's just me....,"...but it seems that I have either become immune to the awfulness that makes Hoarders what it is, or the show just isn't what it used to be."
5,SweetS 7th Single,"This is a great single from the Japanese pop group, ""SweetS."" There are four tracks on this CD. One is in Japanese the other is in English.1. Mienai Tsubasa (Romaji converted from Katakana)2. Waiting for UEach vocal track also has an instrumental version. Tracks 3 and 4 are the instrumental versions. Even if you don't know Japanese, both are very good songs to listen to."
2,A little disappointing,This product was a little disappointing. The fabric was very poor quality and the bag small.
3,"Their loudest ever, but better on CD!","I know BOC album openers tend to be among the best tracks. But the first time I heard ""White Flags"" it blew me away as no other BOC tune in 10 years of being a fan ever had. It's simply one of the most ""dynamic"" songs I've ever heard, with the eerie, quiet mid-section leading to a powerful last verse that builds to an overwhelming crescendo! CLUB NINJA is my least-favorite of all of BOC's albums; but it contains my #1 favorite BOC song! And ""Dancin' In the Ruins"" (images of pagan rituals and the movie CRY OF THE BANSHEE come to mind) and ""Beat 'Em Up"" (that opening sound-mesh always makes me look around to check for ALIENS on the loose) AIN'T BAD, either. The rest is just noise to me-- but with a CD you can play all songs like singles anyway!"
5,Another very underrated album!,"I really don't get why this album has so many negative reviews... I really don't get how anyone can give this album less than 3 stars... Ok, it's not as good as most of Blue Öyster Cult's previous albums (I haven't heard all of them, but I know that it's much better than Revolution By Night), but it's very catchy! All of the songs are catchy and most of them have great riffs! A few songs are not very original, but they're still good and that's coming from someone who can't stand unoriginality.Seriously, don't avoid this album because of the negative reviews! I was going to avoid it, but I didn't and I'm really glad I didn't!"
2,WHAT IN HELL WERE THEY THINKING?,"It is quite clear...the 1980's were not very good for Blue Oyster Cult. Take this album, for instance. CLUB NINJA gives the impression that they were following the lead of others rather than taking the rock and roll bull by the horns and blazing a heavy metal trail for guitar worshippers to follow.Also, a gaping talent hole was left in BOC when Albert Bouchard was dismissed and Allen Lanier left the band. The sound is very good, however, and that makes up for NINJA'S shortcomings.It is known that this album was the reason that Joe Bouchard departed from BOC and mainly for the direction of the music that left him more than a shade dissatisfied.But...never to fear...in 1988 Blue Oyster Cult released their best album...the monster known as IMAGINOS!"
4,stern connection,"BOC trivia thats Howard Stern doing the voice at the beginning of ""When the War Comes"""
2,THE B.O.C. DISAPPOINTMENT,"I looked recently at an interview with bassist/vocalist Joe Bouchard and agree with him that the music had gone downhill, making that one of the main reasons he had quit. NO VAMPIRE SONGS. NO ALLEN LANIER. I'm not down on B.O.C., but this is clearly, in my own American opinion, not their best effort."
1,Club Ninja: One Club I Won't Join,"Continuing the downhill slide that began with ""The Revolution By Night"", BOC sprang ""Club Ninja"" on the world back in '86. Longtime keyboardist-guitarist Allen Lanier (who these days looks worse than Keith Richards) was smart enough to stay away this time out. There's also a lot of outside songwriting on this LP, which wouldn't bother me if the songs were decent, but they're not. What we have here is one good song (""Perfect Water""), one decent outside-penned ""Burnin' For You"" re-write (""Dancin' In The Ruins"") and a whole lot of songs that aren't even worth mentioning. Why Koch reissued this turkey over the also-out-of-print (and far superior) ""Imaginos"" is anybody's guess. The two songs I mentioned are on the ""Workshop Of The Telescopes"" CD compilation, so there's no reason to go near ""Club Ninja""."
2,Oh man... read my Revolution By Night review please...,"Well... they must have had a contract obligation to produce another album... I cannot explain otherwise another load of such an uninspired junk. One song is more or less OK - ""Beat'em Up"" at least has some drive to it, tune and rhythm are pretty catchy there. The rest of it, though... oh yeah, consistency is there alright, but it's the wrong kind of consistency - that is, consistently weak music and, all of a sudden, weirdly bad (or is it badly weird) lyrics. Forget about it..."
2,Sillyness,"I do love this band and I do own everything they have done but this is one lousy piece of crap of an album. Come on now, even the band was embarrassed by it so that must tell you something.Although, Perfect Water is one of their best tunes and you can't not sing along to Dancing in the Ruins, the rest of this is utter cheese.I actually laugh when I put it on. It's like a joke movie soundtrack."
2,Not Enough Punch From This Club Ninja,"BOC were long past their peak at this point;Fire Of Unknown Origin was the last LP that semi-mattered (still say they lost a lot after the first three records). The best things here are the mellow ballads of one Mr. Buck Dharma,not quite the way this act got it's start. ""Dancin In The Ruins"" is a great cut, and ""Pefect Water"" is just behind it. ""Madness To The Method"" may be a little too syrupy though. Bloom's songs are just plain stupid; ""Make Rock Not War"" and ""Beat Em' Up"" (can we say conflicting philosophies) are the worst songs in the band's history,at least up to this point. Lanier is absent from the festivities and reportedly doesn't even consider this a BOC album and refuses to perform any of this live (lucky for us). Get this one, Imaginos, and Revolution By Night only after you've completely run out of all things BOC to buy and want to complete your collection for the archives."
2,WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?,"This album has to be the very worst of the B.O.C. efforts. But never to fear...after their worst album came, after almost two years...the best album by B.O.C.----IMAGINOS!"
2,"Ooooh,this is.......","Yes,this is thee last BOC to buy. The one with so few good songs(one?).I think ""Perfect Water"" is the only song salvageable from this wreck.A sad release , lost in some kind of confusion(I thnk?).I love this band,but ooohh this sucks."
1,Blue Oyster Cult at it's worst,"This album is crap. B.O.C. should never have attached it's name to it. They must have needed to meet a contractual deadline. If you want to know what the real B.O.C. is all about listen to Tyranny & Mutation (definately their best work) or Agents of Fortune, anything but this junk. If you like this album, you ned to stick with listening to the Bee Gees."
4,CLUB NINJA is better than you'd think.,"I mean, any record with ""White Flags,"" ""Dancin' in the Ruins,"" and ""When the War Comes"" is worth purchasing. And guess what? The only one with those three on it is this one. The good songs include the afore-mentioned ""White Flags,"" (the band flirted with semi-progresive keys and solos and this one)the MTV hit ""Dancin' in the Ruins,"" the somehow good yet still cheesy ""Make Rock Not War,"" and the seriocomic ""When the War Comes,"" what with the serious verses and the apparent ""ooga-chaka""'s during the musical breaks. Unfortunately, there is filler. This comes in the guise of ""Beat 'Em Up,"" the most derivative song I have ever heard from the BOC (""Imaginos"" seems pretty good by comparison). However, this is a hard record to come by in many places, so you are advised to buy it on sight if you are a BOC fan."
5,Great resource for information on toilet learning,"What's great about this book is that it covers all the basic information in a quick and easy to read format. The combination of having a section for parents and then a section for the child is wonderful. The bottom line message which I think all parents should follow is to let your child give up the diapers when he/she is ready. Otherwise you spend a lot of time and effort on ""potty training"" when the child is going to do it when they are ready anyway."
3,Ok for older potty trainers,We started early with elimination communication & moved to toilet training at about 15 months. This book is not very helpful at that age. I think it would be good for older potty trainers who can appreciate the pictures & having the book read to them. Maybe for over 2?
2,Thanks...but no thanks,"First, Somewhere on Amazon.com I read that the pictures in this book are FULL COLOR. They are NOT. I did not find this book helpful at all as far as showing the pictures to my son while he sits on the toilet. He has no interest in looking at these cartoon people. I've never seen a kid have less of an interest in anything in my life."
1,Let the buyer beware!,"I was super disappointed upon receiving this CD. I thought I had finally scored a copy of ""Sit Down I Think I Love You"" by the Mojo Men. I excitedly put the CD in the player and waited to be transported back to 1967...""What's this crap!"" Something came out that sounded nothing like the original. Other songs were even worse. I then read the small print on the front of the disc ""New stereo recordings by the Original Artists"". A must to avoid!!"
5,Magnificent Modern Macbeth,"This Shakespearian adaptation updates Macbeth to the 1970's and puts him in a diner in Scotland, PA. Macbeth's ambivalent ambition but submission to his sexy wife (played formidably by former ER nurse, Maura Tierney) is developed nicely in this film. It is easily understood by a modern audience. Christopher Walken is hysterical as vegeterian Detective MacDuff and makes Macduff a vivid, rounded character.Note to teachers: preview the film before showing it to students. There is cursing and there are two scenes which you may find questionable and want to censor. I think it is fine for High School Juniors and Seniors, but more conservative teachers/ districts may object to it."
2,Strange movie,"Hmmm. I originally bought the movie because I am a Christopher Walken fan and he stars in it. I was disappointed that there are only a few scenes which he is in and his character lacks depth. Not typical for Christopher Walken characters. The movie is lame at best and would be like something you'd find late night while you're flipping around the channels when there is nothing to watch. Don't waste your time, thumbs down on this one."
5,it's great,hey this isnt a good movie by any means but it's a fun badly acted strange indie film. i loved it. just watch it if you want pure camp.
4,fabulous,"I didn't even realize at first that this was a riff off of Macbeth, but I got the joke and I enjoyed it. Very tongue-in-cheek, very absorbing, and yes, very depressing. All the acting is superb."
2,Hollywood goes Independent!,"This story is suppose to parallel MacBeth. It is set in the 1970's and has cameos by Hollywood stars. Remember when Indie films were hip and refreshing? Now, everyone in Hollywood is trying to either make or star in an Indie film. Sometimes the film succeeds to break away from Hollywood standards. Sometimes it is a deliberate attempt to be different and is transparent. I thought this film was the latter."
2,Boring,"This is an adaptation of Shakespeare's ""Macbeth"", told in the 1970's with James LeGros and Maura Tierney as Mac and Pat McBeth who work at Duncan's fast food restaurant. Before you know it, they've killed him and turned the restaurant into ""McBeth's"" with a huge M arch. Just like the original story, Pat and Mac start freaking out a bit when McDuff (Christopher Walken) doesn't accept the scapegoat they set up and starts investigating Duncan's murder further. All does not end well.Everyone else I talked to seemed to love this, so maybe it was just me, but apart from the three furies (Andy Dick is one of them) who tell McBeth's future with a magic 8 ball, and Christopher Walken's vegetarian,gentle McDuff, this all fell a bit flat. The comedy did not really stand out and all the characters are played so unsympathetically, that who cares what happens to them. Occasional glimmers of smart dialogue, but mainly this left me wanting to go read the original again."
2,Poor quality transfer,"Sorry Warner Bros but your print of this films falls down due to the poor quality transfer compared to the odyssey dvd release back in 2002/2004. I bought this thinking that it would be superior as its direct from Warner Bros and paid double what the old UK DVD cost me and was hoping for a much better quality print. Im finding after many purchases of WB Archive discs that even though they are coming from Warner Bros they are not always that great quality, in fact picture quality on many is below what they show on TV in the UK, why is this???If you want this film try to get the old Odyssey DVD, its far better.I bought it then sold it on ebay afrer getting the better british issue."
1,DISAPPOINTED!,"Had the pleasure of seeing you the foodtv network with david raggirio, and boy did your outdoor chicken cookout with your family look good! couldn't wait to see if you had a cookbook out, and you did, i bought it.... went through and marked all the recipes i couldn't wait to try...still trying to figure out which recipe is the one shown on the show i mentioned above....anyway my first recipe was ""Owens plain ol' baked wings"" i followed the recipe to the letter! honey, those wings still ain't ""crispy on the outside!"" it took me turning up the heat, draining the water left in the pan, and cooking those wings yet ANOTHER 45 minutes before I saw crispy! please tell me that was a typeo? I am giving you another try tonight with the Potato Herb Chicken Breasts....stay tuned"
3,Ok to read,"This book was ok to read I was more interested with the military angle than the actual romance. I just did not feel the chemistry between the hero and the heroine. He was 45 year old wanna be general , she a 30 year old doctor so full of hate for ex that she was reluctant to trust him.The heroine tho educated don't seem to have much common sense."
2,Not what I expected,"This book was not wat I expected at all. I like Gwynne Forster, but this book left too many loose ends. Something like my review!!"
5,The story of Ironfist Chimine continues in Ironfist #2,"A great sequel to a great original. Ironfist #2 offers the same great animation, with an incredible storyline to back it up. A must read for all manga and anime fans!"
4,"Good Story, Excellent Artwork","Very crisp story with hilarious jokes and nice drawings, a must for any anime fans."
5,Very cute,"Fast delivery, I purchased them in the Beige colour for work and they are so cute, while they pinch a bit at the toes they are overall quite comfortable."
4,nice price,The pouch of treats came fairly well crushed. I now have Grizzly NuTreat crumbs. The treats seem to be very well liked by my dog. I have been using them for years but got them from a different vendor who I will go back to.
2,waste of time...,"I LOVED Cold Sassy Tree and expected more of the same and wanted MORE about the characters that I grew to love, sadly... I was just terribly disappointed. If I'm not mistaken, Olive Ann Burns didn't even get to finish this novel before she died and someone else took it over and had it published. Makes me wonder if she would've done it better or just scrapped the whole idea of a sequel if she'd lived."
2,Should have been left alone,"A very disappointing ""sequel"" to the original Cold Sassy Tree. The finished section was ok, but reading the author's notes as to possibilities that should, could or would happen next were very unfulfilling. The marriage difficulties based on Sanna's personality and Will's unrelenting love for his first girlfriend didn't seem to spring from any of what the author wrote in the first half. ""Leave"" this one alone."
2,Disappointing,I read Cold Sassy Tree several times before I started on Leaving Cold Sassy. Unfortunately there is not enough of a story in this book to be classified as a sequel. I finished it feeling very unfulfilled.
1,Leaving Cold Sassy,"Those who have read the marvelous ""Cold Sassy Tree"" by Olive Ann Burns will be sorely disappointed by this sequel. There is none of the charm and story telling mastery of the original novel in this pitiful book. It seems to be put together hastily and by people who did not care that it would bring shame to the original. Olive Ann was ailing when she wrote the few chapters of this sequel and it is almost as if a different person were writing it. It seems rushed and does a wonderful job of destroying the main characters that the original developed so beautifully. If you have read Cold Sassy Tree and are wondering whether or not to read this sequel, be warned, if you read it you would have a bad taste in your mouth and will feel cheated.This book will take away from the warmth that you felt when you finished reading the fine book, Cold Sassy Tree.Those who decided to go ahead and print these few chapters did Olive Ann Burns and her readers a disservice."
5,fabulous read,this was such a wonderful book. I recommend it to EVERYONE! You will not be sorry if you read it and will want to buy the sequel.
2,sad,"this was a very sad book knowing that it wasn't completed due to the author's untimely death, so it leaves one unfulfilled and sadened. Having been spoiled by her first novel Cold sassy tree, there were naturally certain reading expectations that will forever be left unmet...but i don't regret having read the book."
3,I wish I could give two different ratings for this book,"I wish I could give this book two different ratings. As a sequel to ""Cold Sassy Tree"", it fails miserably. It is unevenly written, and the story just doesn't flow very well.However, as a tribute to the author and the sensation she sparked with the original book, it succeeds magnificently. Instead of learning what happens next to Will Tweedy, we learn about the author. It is amazing to me that the author wrote the original text while fighting cancer. I can barely manage to write a quick email when I just have a small cold!If you are really expecting a sequel to ""Leaving Cold Sassy"", you will be well-served to pass up this book. If, however, you are interested in the author behind the book, you will find a reasonably satisfying answer to that question."
4,Olive Ann Burns was an amazing woman,"I read ""Leaving Cold Sassy"", wanting to find out what happened to Will Tweedy. I enjoyed the sequel. But because it was unfinished, I was left with wanting more.What really touched me was the writing of Ms. Kenison on Olive Ann Burns. Ms. Kenison presents the story of a truly amazing woman. Mrs. Burns was an incredibly strong woman, who seemed to remain positive and happy despite the trials and tribulations of her life. I enjoyed learning about the woman behind ""Cold Sassy Tree"", and how she came to develop the story of Will Tweedy."
5,Leaving Cold Sassy,Loved it and was very disappointed when it ended. The story about the life and death of the author was very uplifting as well as sad. What an entertaining writer and I couldn't put down Cold Sassy Tree or this half-finished sequel. Highly recommended if you enjoyed Cold Sassy Tree.
2,Bad sole,The soles wore out entirely in 2-3 months. I do not recommend buying these is you use them for work.
2,Not what I was expecting,"I thought I had ordered The Alpha8 not the Fort Hood. These are NOT slip resistant Alpha 8. What a waste, its great boot, but no good to me if i have no traction."
1,Too Stiff,"I returned them. Too stiff and hard, and the leather seemed cheap. Sized a little small too, compared to boots that I own and wear."
2,Imported,"Prior to ordering I called Rocky and asked them where these boots were manufactured. I was told ""Puerto Rico - USA"". When the boots arrived, the tag inside states Made in China. I would not have ordered these boots if I had been told they were made in China (perhaps that's why they tell people otherwise??)"
2,madmarine1981,If you have any kind of foot issues I do not recommend you buy this boot. They are not very flexible and do not offer alot of support without added arch supports. They are good looking boots and would be great for someone without foot issues.
2,Only One Impressive Scene,"The only scene that I enjoyed was the Girl/Girl scene, because I prefer women getting it on with women. There were some good shots of the blonds and redheads but not much else. Don't be fooled by the cover! It's not near the word of hardcore. The only thing close it the Girl/Girl fake 69 part in the beginning. If you are looking for hardcore than look at Spice they offer some good scenes that involve girls touching each other much more naughtier than Playboy. Playboy just does have any hardcore at all simply put. Save your money and buy something better."
2,Poor Camera Work,"The camera work was poor in this video. The scenes moved too quickly and they seemed to lack continuity. Most Playboy videos move too quickly from scene to scene but this one was worse than most. The girls were very good, it was just very hard to get a focus on any of them for more than a second."
2,Beware of exchange $ and size,I ordered this item for my husband. Even though I ordered his correct size it was about 2 full sizes too big. I chose not to exchange them because I had to pay a fee in addition to the return shipping. I just shipped them back and will buy them someplace else.
1,OVER $50 FOR THESE?!!!!! REALLY?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,What a damned rip-off. Price is absurd. The materials clearly don't warrant that much. At $10 they would still be making 80% profit.
3,Confusing sizes,The cons were delivered very quickly considering it was christmas time but unfortunately the size was all wrong. I ordered a uk size 5 but the shoes I got were more like a 4.
5,Satisfied......,"I was very satisfied with my purchase, it arrived quickly. I have bought this brand of shoes before and they were tight, so I ordered a half size larger. These shoes were way too big, but Lastpairs Inc. were very easy about returning and exchanging shoe sizes. Shoes were exchanged very quickly. Will do business again."
2,In Record Time? Maybe. - In Depth? No Way.,"Indeed, it explains XML and DTD's pretty well. But probably, you're looking for more. Especially when the back-cover mentions ""Coverage includes 'XSL', 'Converting HTML to XML', 'WIDL',..."" The book merely 'touches' these topics. For real implementation instructions, it redirects you to the Internet. Other books offer you the same thing AND much more (eg. the 'XML Bible' for great XSL-coverage and 'XML by Example' for a Java-point-of-view)."
3,OK... nothing great!,"The book is intended for beginners with little or no knowledge of HTML / XML. The book is long and it takes a while before you get to introduce the XML code.After that, the book just offers a lengthy explanation for every sample bit of code. The book does not give any hands-on practice. The author keeps mentioning that ""it's time to get your hands dirty"" with some XML code, but never tells you to write a sample code.The book is ok, but you would need another book to give you some hands-on experience.Overall, the book is nothing to rave about!"
1,One of the worst book,"From the beginning of the book, the author stated that the buyer of the book will eventually ""get their hands dirty"" in later chapter. That's what I have been hoping for. After I have finished almost three quarter of the book, I still have not seen any hand-ons tutorial that I could do. All I got from the book was long-winded explaination.My advise is, find another book if you really want to learn XML."
4,"clear, practical coverage of XML","This book teaches you everything you need to know XML implementations from key concepts and terminology to the realities of mastering existing DTDs. Its a very useful book, however this is only as an introductory book. Advanced topics like Schemas, Namespaces, DOM doesn't even find a passing reference here."
5,Excellent,I'm so glad I bought this book and not Latham's text books. It's the perfect length. I'm sure I may not be able to work on it all at once and I may not even do some of the things mentioned in the book. But it has and will be worth the money spent. I just wish there was an even smaller version for my husband to read!!
3,Hard read,This book is not an easy read. It has good ideas but uses unfamiliar words a lot. I also feel like it's a book for parents that have children that have already gone astray. Not for a young mother to gain inspiration and ideas for young children.
1,NOT Safe for your lawn or plants,"I used this product last winter and it killed part of my lawn and some ground cover. The lawn was completely dead along the entire driveway where I used the product. I only had the small size container and didn't even use all of it over the entire winter, but it served as a very potent grass killer.Since it's so toxic to plants, I question if it's safe for pets."
5,Also realize that this is also safer for kids too,"I don't currently have a pet but there are plenty of animals in the area so I was interested from that aspect. But this stuff can be spread with your bare hands with no drying or cracking you would get with most of the salts out there. And that was very helpful when my toddler liked to ""help"" me. I didn't have to worry about him sticking his hands in the bucket while I was working with it.And not too long ago we had a stretch of snow storms one after another after another. I started to notice that even when it started as rain and turns to snow which usually means a layer of ice under the snow, using Safe Paws was making that layer of ice softer and easier to take up."
5,The best reggae since Bob,"Unite is a musical and spiritual awakening. It combines traditional roots reggae with fresh new rhythms. The title track is an anthem calling for unity... so timely when the world seems to be coming apart at the seams. ""Dear Bob"" is a fitting tribute to the king of reggae. I can't stop singing these songs over and over. Contributions of some great musicians and backup singers add to the tapestry. I can't recommend an album more highly."
2,review of BBC Portrait of A Lady,"I had wanted to see this because it is one of my favorite books and BBC usually does a good job. This was, however, a big disappointment. It looked like a play that was filmed. The actors, with the exception of Richard Chamberlain, were wooden and expressionless. It was worthwhile only for Richard Chamberlain's teriffic performance."
5,Awesome!,"My friend gave me this book last week as an early Christmas present, knowing that I was a huge fan of Hilary Duff. I've read other books about Hilary, and all of them were good, but this one is excellent! It's sort of a scrapbook about Hilary Duff, packed with many cool, full-color photos and more. You'll find trivia, quizzes, facts, cool secrets, and much, much more about this talented teen actress/singer. I showed the book to some of my friends, and they really liked reading it and finding out more about Hilary Duff. The book is unauthorized, though, so there may be some false information in it, but that shouldn't spoil your enjoyment of this book. It's a well-written, fast-paced, enjoyable read for all Hilary Duff fans."
2,"good product, but over-rated hype.",I thought I was purchasing the Kwikset product that was the highest protection against bumping. By the description online that is what I thought I was getting. Turns out it is not and the shipping and return shipping makes it economically unwise to return it.
3,"Good, but not great",You will get through this game pretty quickly once you learn how to control your mech and when to use which weapons. There isn't a tutorial and you get thrown into action right away so you will want to review the controls before you start. The missions are generally fairly short and there are only 14 of them. The only reason you likely wouldn't finish in a day is that they get increasingly difficult so you need to learn how best to use your mech. Once that happens though you can finish pretty quickly. There is very low replayability too. At least it's a cheap game and it lets you play something a little different than the usual ones out there.
3,"Not terrible from start to finish, but does definitely have one major low point","The Weather Girls, Martha Wash and Izora Rhodes-Armstead, were the duo responsible for the huge 1983 post-disco hit ""It's Raining Men."" Two years later, they made this album that has a strong emphasis on famous covers. Along with the original material, the two of them offer up their versions of the 4 Seasons ""Big Girls Don't Cry,"" Creedence Clearwater Revival's ""Down On The Corner,"" and Neil Sedaka's ""Laughter In The Rain."" Their treatments of the latter two are respectable, but ""Big Girls Don't Cry"" is turned into a terrible mess that these two big girls should most definitely be crying over."
5,AWESOME!,"I liked this bracelet so much that I came back for a second one. Beautiful bracelet, fits perfectly and the price is amazing. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"
3,"Great picture, poor sound","As an earlier reviewer mentioned, the sound on the second episode on each of the DVD's is extremely poor. There must be something wrong with the master. I wouldn't be surprised if they pulled this set off the market. It's really a major problem. Which is too bad, I've been waiting for this for a long time."
2,Great for fans only.,"I found the packaging and marketing of these Prisoner DVD volumes a bit misleading. I was expecting something more from the special features. There really are no special features to speak of..not really. A and E advertises the special features in vol. 1 including deleted scenes and clips. Actually, these are a couple of short b-roll clips without sound. In other words, they are literally a 30 second shot of a file cabinet and then a silent shot of some other prop. These are just scraps from the editing floor...not even outtakes. It's just an a stupid reason to claim ""special features"".As for the show itself. It looks great and if you're predisposed to like this kind of stuff...it's great. So if you're a big fan of the prisoner...then by all means spend more money on your obsession. Otherwise..wait for the Robert McQaurry movie or rent the entire VHS series from a good video store."
2,THE PRISONER IS A CLASSIC SERIES,"the prisoner series even had it's own collectable magazine that would often go into detail on the MEANING of the show plots. the star, # 6, patrick was a voice on the simpsons in an episode, and there are at least two simpsons episodes that make references to the prisoner and especially ""rover"" the big killer balloon that guards the water around the village - if it's good enough for the simpsons to reference, it's good enough to own all of the episodes - which i do on video and i plan to aquire all of the episodes on DVD so my four-year-old son can watch this classic series when he gets older. if you've never seen this series, i HIGHLY recommend it. peace."
4,Great fun!,"When I had a Turbo 16 back in the day , Vigilante was a game that you would usually find me playing. For any old school gamer or anyone that loves the old 16 bit 2d style gameplay , this is for definitley for you. You'll enjoy many hrs. of great fun as I did. And don't worry if your concerned about playing this with your family or children , don't. This is simply an old style action game. No graphic blood and guts , or half naked women in the background. Just good fun.Pros: Good solid Graphics / enjoyable simple gameplay"
4,"Fantastic, once it's up.","I got this for my Sony 52"" XBR5. I wanted the very best, strongest, and most maneuverable mount I could get. I do not believe it will ever come down, and I'm sure not nervous that the TV will fall on me or anybody. I agree with R.D. Fisher that It's overkill for a 52"" LCD, but also that if you need the strength, the flexibility of repositioning your TV, you cannot beat this mount.That said, I gave it 4 of 5 because:I wish it screwed into three studs (16"" centers) like the Peerless mount I used for my 52"" Samsung in the bedroom..I agree with Digger in Texas that the instructions suck (Peerless instructions are 100% better) and are mostly pictograms, and the hardware is minimally applicable. I had to use bolts from the Peerless mount."
5,Loved the mount except for mounting hardware,"Love the mount now that it's up. Works great and is rock solid. As per previous reviews, don't bother using the mounting lag bolts provided, three of the 4 supplied snapped in two when I was installing them, just go down and by new at the local hardware store. The TV mounting bolts provided were also to short for the sony 52"" and I had to purchase the right ones at the hardware store. But once that was resolved it went up easy and worked great."
5,Superb Manufacturing/Engineering,"The engineering on this device is superb.The only problem I had was I broke the head off one of the lag bolts while bolting the bracket to the wall. My neighbor had the same issue. Is the wood too hard in my walls? or is the lag bolt not strong enough?I went to Virgil's and bought 4 new lag bolts, to make sure they were all good.It's great how I can point the Sony TV in any direction!"
3,Could be better...,The instructions were pictures with minimal use of writing. Would have been better to use both. And the screws used to hold the mount to the TV were way too short. Had to make a trip to Lowe's. But the design and function is outstanding when you get passed that...
4,Great overall product,"Very heavy duty, sturdy wall-mount. I was nervous about the tv falling on our kids, but after seeing the high quality of this mount, I was no longer worried. We had to buy new hardware for it because the included hardware didn't seem sturdy enough, but overall is was easy to install and works great."
3,"Good Design, Lower Quality Parts","The Design is great and exactly what i needed. It's got a very easy brainless setup but the LAG bolts were really cheap. I went and spent 3.86 on new lagbolts and asked amazon compensation! I broke 2 of the lag bolts just ratcheting them. They literally snapped off! I've never EVER had this with a lag bolt, ever. So that's my advice. If you buy this item spend about 3-4$ for higher quality lagbolts. Other than that it's a great item but because i got inferior quality bolts i can't give this item any higher than 3 star."
5,Great book for Eastern Birds,"This has been a great book for Eastern USA birds. Easy to find the bird your looking for, or trying to identify!"
4,The Best Cartoons came outta the 1960's,I have seen the series recently on The Cartoon Network with the original series the characters came out from 'Wacky Races'.Much better than the cartoon characters on these days.
2,ridiculous,"Lost my original charger so bought this one.Turns out you have to put the battery in upside down to line up the little metal +/- chargers.Not only that, but the battery won't make contact with the charging elements without shoving several thick pieces of paper or cardboard into the front where there is a little ridge to hold it in. Doing this it finally worked but it's a hack to get it to work.Definitely wouldn't buy again."
3,plated not solid brass,"I presumed by the description that this was a solid brass caddy, I was mistaken and this is a steel product with a thin brass like coating on it."
3,Update,"Well, three months later, the brass-plated shower caddy is still being used. It did rust, despite having sprayed it with Krylon Clear paint, but the rust wipes off and it was again sprayed with Krylon Clear. You may wonder why a shower caddy is worth this much effort....well, the dimensions are big enough for holding large bottles of shampoo, conditioner AND shower soap. In addition, the soap dish on the bottom tier is very convenient. Most caddies only have two shelves while this has three, sooo...I will continue to wipe it off and re-spray it because brass plated caddies are very hard to find, and this one does fill the bill size-wise."
2,less than ideal,"Item is attractive and functionality good. However, came with part of brass plate smudged off. Cost not enough to return so will live with it"
1,Shower Caddy,The description sounds good but once I received the shower caddy.I realized it was cheaply made! It was too much trouble to send backso I ended up throwing in the trash and ordered another one.You buy cheaply you get cheap!!! I should have known!Brass Euro Shower Organizer by Better Bath
1,Boris Midney's 'undiscovered' is no treasure,"being a huge 'Boris Midney' fan, when they released the catalog of his music, I bought it all. Having been a disc jockey since 1977 - Midney's orchestrations were what the glory days of disco were all about. This particular CD - The Black Russian, falls short of all his other productions.Outside of 'A Child Is born' (which can be found on his Anthology), the rest of the music is just not good. Stay away from this one folks and buy his anthology - where you can find the music that Midney created better than any other producer/arranger of his time."
3,Good Book as a Reference,"Good book to have as a reference point. Only problem, there are not enough elementary school level letters for school administrators. This needs to be corrected in order for the book to become GREAT!"
2,Drab and shallow,Characters were drab and one dimensional. The stories lacked depth and some bordered on boring.
1,Not as good as it sounds,"Though the writing in this is of decent quality, the editting is atrocious. Compared to similar anthology books, this is severely lacking. Save your money... or spend it on one or more of the other titles which outshine this one."
5,Fantastic,"I married a 100% Armenian husband, and my mother-in-law gave me this book back in 1974. Since then I have aquired a few Armenian cookbooks and of course the Armenian church ones too. The Armenian Cooking Today By Alice Antreassian, is by far the best, it's my ""bible"" forArmenian cooking and way surrpasses any of the others I have ever tried. I am ordering one now for my daughter."
2,Not right for my son at least,the buttons and things were difficult for him to work. He was horrified by the cow mooing and this started a noise aversion that still persists a year later. The old ones from when I was a kid were much easier and more suited for him.
1,"Agreed, much better alternatives",Buttons are hard to push and turn for such tiny hands. Sometimes they don't even work! Very disappointed with this purchase.
3,"Okay, but ....","My greatgranddaughter (7 mos) is entranced by the toy, but cannot manage the button for the dog. It's a button that has to be turned . It's too small and too complicated for her hands. I have some concerns that the hard plastic tops may break under the less than tender ministrations of an infant or toddler.That said, I like the association of the animal with its toy/product, i.e. cow with milk bottle, dog with bone. I like the music and the actual sounds of each animal. It is certainly better than many plastic toys I've seen at various stores."
1,SAVE A TRIP BACK TO RETURN THIS TOY!,"I totally agree with the other negative reviews!!! Unfortunately, I didn't read the reviews until after the purchased the thing. The edges are sharp and the buttons are way too difficult to maneuver. They say for children 6 months and up...what the heck are they thinking?? I returned it and purchased Playskool's Busy Popin Pals instead. My 10 month old really enjoys the Popin Pals and can manipulate it with ease. I purchased this Playskool pop up box for around $11 at Toys R Us but I was unable to locate this item on the website."
3,Wait awhile,"Not for the very young infant. You'll probably have to wait awhile before the child ""gets it"". Although colorful and somewhat educational, the ""buttons"" for response are a bit difficult for a young infant to manage."
1,TERRIBLE TOY!,"With my son being a huge Baby Einstein fan, I was sure he would love this. We bought this for him for Christmas when he was nine months old. He is now a year old and he still doesn't play with it. When you press the cow, another one will pop up. They are hard to open too, even when you do push them. Also, it's not the least bit exciting. I am very disappointed with this toy. Don't waste your money!"
1,Terrible,"I usually love Baby Einstein products, but I don't love this one. It's very poorly designed. The buttons are too hard for little hands, even my 1 year old has a hard time with them. The toy itself is too small, the sounds don't work correctly half the time, and it has too many sharp edges. Don't waste your money."
1,save your money !,"We received this as a gift for my son and he, like the others who have commented, has gotten his fingers pinched while pushing the animals down. There are sharp & pointy edges, the triggers are to hard for him in his age group (can't pull the milk can or turn the dog bone), the bird never stays shut & dog will pop up without any sound....it's delayed. VERY POOR design. I should have returned it. However, my son LOVES the music, sounds & slamming the tops down, it does grab his attention, but I have to make the animals pop up for him."
2,TOP OF THE LINE KENWOOD COMES SHORT,"The ipod interface is horrible. It will only recognize your playlists as disks in you changer, up to ten only! You can never find a song that you want - no control over that.They don't tell you ahead of time that this unit only plays DVD, not DVD-R. Forget playing your home made DVDR on this unit unless it is formatted as video. That means no MP3 playing off a DVDR.This top of the line unit is not compatible with the Kenwood KCA BT100 bluetooth accessory, while lower models are!! There is no hands-free blue tooth accessory for this unit! Tech support don't know why. They don't tell you that when you buy the KCA BT100. Now I have to teturn it.Oh, the navi works OK. Kenwwod have got to put heir act together and not mislead the customers."
5,Aged like the finest wine!,"I recently dropped Swoon into the CD player in my car and was transported back in time. After ten or fifteen years it's great to find that Swoon still seems to capture colors and sounds which would go unnoticed if not for the work of Prefab Sprout. This album should be required listening for any dreamer. In a very real way, it clears the palate of much of today's weak pop music. Ah SWOON!!!!"
5,Independent Pop Masterpiece,"Prefab Sprout was, problably, one of the bands that, during the eighties, gave much quality to pop music listeners. ""Two Wheels Good"" is, in my opinion, the best record EVER. But, what about ""Swoon""? With 541 cd's in my personal collection, ""Swoon"" ranks at number 4 because of its simplicity. Paddy McAloon is as good as Lennon, Leonard Cohen or Bob Dylan as a composer.If you want an alternative to Mainstream Pop, you MUST buy ""Swoon""."
3,Good Ideas-shows you step by step,"This book accompanied along with Community Geography: GIS in Action, make a great pair in completing community mapping projects with classrooms grades K-12. Again, like Community Geography, the books took a long time to get to me (over a month), so plan in advance."
4,More than just boleros,"Three songs are plainly waltzes, one is definitely rock and a big surprise at that, and one track, Vuelve Conmigo, is a nice Argentine style Zamba with wonderful ringing guitars. The recording is quality stereo throughout.Julio Jaramillo was born in Ecuador in 1935 and died at only 43 years old in 1978."
3,Not the best of Julio,"While this is a great example of the incredible singing voice of beloved ecuadorian balladeer Julio Jaramillo, or ""JJ"", it does not showcase his versatile personality while singing. It is a great introductory disc for people to get to know Julio and his music, but it is not a must in any JJ collectors' personal stash of music by this idol who in his short life produced almost as many songs and records as children he left on this planet. Good CD and an invaluable commemorationof the beauty of Ecuadorian music and JJ's ireplaceable singing voice"
5,An Awesome Director,"I've Only been living for a little more than 12 years but i can tell tou how great of a director Tim Burton is.i havnt read the book yet but i know for sure its gona be good.think about it this way, tim burton has made all these great movies, like Edward Scissorhands(my personal favorite), the nightmare before christmas, corps bride, and a lot more so if he made all those awesome movies, its gona be good"
4,if you love burton,"bought this for my son, who's a burton fan. he liked that it's a window into burton's thoughts, but would have liked more illustrations/pics."
3,Just So So Good,One bulb is growing slowly and the other not at all. Followed instructions to the tee. We will see if the one will make it through winter.
1,Not funny,"I love South Park and don't mind raunchy humor, but I turned this one off before it was over. Couple of chuckles (theme song was good for a chuckle), and a few good barbs at world leaders, but overall a snoozefest. Just because you make can make puppets have sex and say the f-word doesn't make it funny. I can't imagine what most of the reviewers here saw in this movie to give it 5 stars."
2,"I mean to change it to 3.5 stars, but it won't let me!!!","Okay, I just saw the unedited puppet intimate scene, and it is by far one of the funniest things I've seen in d*mn near a decade. still, Janeane Garofalo did not deserve to die, nor did Tim Robbins, Susan Sarandon, or George Clooney. I was not sad about losing Alec Baldwin, Matt Damon, or George Clooney (I changed my mind). I still love those panthers."
3,A FILM THATMAKES PUPPETS LOOK BAD,THERE ARE ACTUALLY REALLY 366 REVIEWS BUT A BETTER COST FOR A MOVIE LIKE THIS AS THE FIRST MARANETTE FILM TO BE CRUDE AND TO BE OFFENSIVE AND MAKE FUN OF BUT THAT WAS SUPPOST TO LIKE HOW FAR CAN YOU GO WITH YOURE HOUMOUR IN A MARANNETTE FILM BUT THIS HAS HORRIBLE DIALOGUE BUT ISNT EVEN THAT CRUDE OR OFFENSIVE IF YOU REALLY JUST SEE THERE REALLY JUST MAKING FUN OF
1,Unfair!,"I thought people weren't ALLOWED to make movies like this in America! Roger Ebert was right--anyone who hates Hollywood like this is a NIHILIST! If you can't love Hollywood, can you really be capable of the greatest love of all? When I cry my way through the Academy Awards, I feel sorry for the kind of people who made this movie. Is it funny to see a Tim Robbins puppet burned to death? Is it funny to see Sean Penn's arm ripped off by a panther/house cat? Is it funny to see Janeane Garafalo's head blown inside-out? Okay, that one was funny, but even Goebbels got a few gags in now and then. The point is, those fine actors are only guilty of caring and of having an opinion. We will never have a tollerant society until people like Trace and Matt are silenced, outlawed, sent to Gulags, and then silenced again. When the revolution comes, I will no longer be restocking shelves at the video store, and they will bow down before me! Bush is dumb! Viva Che!"
1,"Weak, Empty, Garbage","The main problem with this witless mess is that the gags are stale out of the bag. Most of this material, in fact, was old when it was used in Hot Shots part II. However, what is most offensive was how it lets Neoconservatives completely off the hook. The inept World Police take all their orders from a computer, rather than a venal Bush-like weasel. In fact, Kim Il doesn't come off half as evil as the Hollywood celebrities; who are guilty of having opinions. For this the filmmakers blow their heads off. Cute. This film has no audience because it jumps into an issue in which real lives are being lost, and plays the whole situation for cheap nihilistic laughs."
1,"Teenager Humor, I Fast Forwarded Most of the Movie","I believe that this movie will strike a chord with teenagers and people who believe that vulgarity equals humor. Since there is no real plot and the attempts at laughter fall flat for the most part, I found myself fast forwarding most of the movie. The best part of the movie is actually in the DVD extras which gives a behind the scenes look at the making of the movie. Other than that, it's just a bad movie, period."
1,Crap crap crap,"I wanted to like this. I really did. I am a huge fan of South Park and expected this to be at least as clever. Boy did it miss the mark. I didn't laugh once. The script was weak and the ""parodies"" were just silly and unimaginative. Nice try guys, but no cookie for you. This sucked in new and exciting ways."
4,the hottest puppet sex ive ever seen on screen,"when a political satire manages to piss off both the left and the right, its gotta be doing its job and doing it well. the target of this movie is hypocrisy, and if the susan sarandons of this world dont have enuf self-confidence to be able to appreciate the goofiness of THEIR excesses as well as those of george bush, its more the loss for them. that said, the purposefulness of this low-tech marionette play is a feast for the eyes, and very funny to boot. and if anyone ever creates a better scene of puppet sex, PLEEEZ dont show it to me, lol."
4,Classic stuff,"If your a fan of South Park, and not easily shocked you will love this movie. It has all the little hidden treats that SP has plus more. A Sex scene that will leave you rolled up on the floor hurting because you have laughed so much."
5,Good therapy for America,"Whoever you are and wherever you stand in the war on terrorism, you should laugh at this movie. If you can't, have your sense of humor checked. The fact that the actors are puppets makes it possible to laugh. Real actors would make it uncomfortable and stupid.Most everything concerning the war on terror is ridiculed: terrorists, the military, war protestors, intelligence, WMD. Private contractors and the president are spared. The humor works because the movie takes everything to a ridiculous extreme. Team America destroys the cultural icons of every country they enter. War protestors are traitors actively involved with terrorists. The music is over the top as is the sex.The world has become a scary place. Team America does what satire does best: exposing our idiocy and recklessness by making us laugh."
4,Team America,This was a gift for a friend and he loves this movie.... He recieved it quickly by mail and enjoys it.It is one of his favorite movies.
3,laugh,the movie was very enjoyable to watch. It would be good to watch with gang of friends. It is definetly R rated. the bedroom scene is not one I would want to have to explain to a child. This is a good movie when a night of no thinking is due.
4,INSANELY FUNNY!,"If parts of this movie don't make you laugh, NOTHING WILL!This is one sick movie! Not for the kiddies! You've got tosee this movie, it's insane! F#*% YEAH!"
4,I'll keep this one short..,"Brief synopsis: This latest product of Trey Parker and Matt Stone's twisted imaginations involves Thunderbirds-esque puppetry; the current state of global affairs summarized in lots and lots of collateral damage courtesy of the titular team (""f--k yeah!""); satire of everything ranging from Broadway musicals to Muslim terrorists to Matt Damon; the gruesome on-screen deaths of many Hollyweird limousine leftists; the decimation of the Effel Tower and The Sphinx, amongst other monuments; and acts of marionette coitus, martial arts, and vomiting in all their puerile glory.Conservative prudes, P.C.-obsessed liberals, and everyone else are bound to be offended by at least some portion of this film.Needless to say, purchase is mandatory. I'm reserving my copy as we speak.."
4,FCUK YEAH!,"More offensive and satirical humor from Trey Parker and Matt Stone, hilarious. If you were offended, well you had it coming."
5,HI-LAR-E-US,"My husband and I basically pee our pants every time we watch this movie. It's hilarious. Vulgar, so prepare yourself, but hilarious."
5,The title says it all,"This old school marionette action/adventure format first visited onbaby-boomer kids, is hysterically funny. However, this isn't for kids! It's for grown-up boomers who can appreciate the awkwardness of an outrageous marionette sex scene. Just as Parker and Stone's ""South Park"" is an equal-opportunity offender, so is ""Team America."" Expect extreme stereotypes and un-P.C. behavior. And a lot of good--if sometimes guilty--laughs."
4,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A cheerfully-irreverent satire which isn't afraid of going over the top, Team America targets the political status quo, the formulaic action film, and the musical ""Rent,"" among other, in its (mostly sucessful) attempts to make us laugh."
2,Disappointing,"Parker & Stone were hilarious with South Park Bigger, Longer & Uncut and went over the top with profanity and attacks on celebrities and politicians. Unfortunately, this film is technically creative with the puppets but otherwise an over the top experiment with crudeness and a very weak story. The moments I found humorous were few and far between. Caught myself falling asleep several times (despite coffee). With all the hype this movie received, and the long delay before DVD release, I expected far more. This one is going to the used bin. Agreeing with other reviewers, this is definitely not a family film (not that I ever thought it was)."
3,"Really Funny, but they took some things to far","I am a big fan of South Park, so when I heard about this movie coming out I was going to order it but never got around to it, I finally watched it and it was really funny up until a few parts, If they wouldve taken out 3 parts this movie wouldve kicked a**. but they just took it to far, some parts were really nasty and they werent even nessecary, and swearing every sentence can be funny in a T.V show sometimes but in movies it just gets old, my advice would be to buy an edited version if it came out for this movie"
5,Best movie ever,Every thing about this movie was hilarius. The songs especially. Sex scene was so hilarius. But to the idiots out there who think that because of this movie Trey and Matt love the war. IT IS A MOVIE. CANT YOU TELL THEY ARE MAKING SERIOUS FUN OF ALL YOU RIGHT WING A-HOLES.
3,"Has it's moments, but not as brilliant as some claim.","The South Park guys have created an occasionally funny movie that does a decent job of lampooning gung-ho militarist and hollywood retards. As much as I enjoy watching pea-brained left-wing hollywood a-holes getting massacred in puppet form (please God, let it happen in real life), the movie just isn't as clever and funny as the five star reviewers seem to think. As a side note, I get a chuckle out of reading the one star reviews by left-wing rectums who can't stand getting a little taste of their own medicine."
2,Not near as funny as South Park,"And the politics suddenly go righter-than-right (but still well to the left of Attila the Hun). I thought I'd like it a lot more than I did. There are some funny moments throughout, the sex scene, the puking scene, the Team America Theme Song scene. The plot is not exactly suspenseful, if you say it's a comedy and doesn't need a plot, the comedy is pretty sparse. For the whole film, you're waiting for something really funny to happen, but it never does. Some people complain about 'perceived political content' well hello, it is a comedy about politics, much more so than say, Austin Powers or even Maxwell Smart (remember him?) That would be fine, regardless of what tack it took, if it was a really funny film, but to me it was a wasted opportunity. I'd like to laugh at this film. But I can only laugh NEAR it, it seems."
2,"Could have been a great movie, but....","Team America had all the ingredients for a really great movie. By utilizing the Supermarionation-style puppetry and merging it with pop culture and political satire, it could have been the most original movie of the year. Unfortunately, Trey Parker and Matt Stone seem to be addicted to vulgarity, and the flurry of f-words in their theatrical films would have made Richard Pryor blush. The few clever satirical points they made were overshadowed by the foul language, graphic sex, and gratuitous violence that was peppered all over the film. I was particularly turned off by the ridiculously long puking scene, as well as the homosexual encounter between Gary and his boss.Ultimately, I found Team America: World Police to be a disappointing waste of time, when it could have been a tribute to those wonderful Gerry Anderson kid shows we watched back in the 1960's."
5,"""Holywierd"" Exposed For Who They Really Are","Alec Baldwin IS a F.A.G.... ""you no talent whore."" Other no talent has beens; George ""(C)looney"", Richard ""Doofus"" ""Dry-face"", Barbara Streisand, Matt Damon, Charlie ""Shehan"" and others all exposed for the Left - Wing - Liberals - with - no - knowledge - for - the - real - world they really are. They are desperate for attention because America has hurt them by not filling their deep pockets by not going to see their crappy movies. They are entertainers and no one wants to know what they think. They are not above anybody that is an American and they do NOT tell us what to think."
2,very funny but its too overblown for me...not the worst,"I think Trey Parker and Matt Stone out did themselves on this project. I admit they did an awesome job on the whole movie with the choreographed action scenes but what the hell is up with the puppet sex and the 2 minute puking. It was South Park but in puppet version but I didnt like it that much. Though I thought the fact that the bad guy was Kim Jon Il was hilarious and his puppet is awesome and him singing a song was better. The Team America theme song was funny too and also that fact that they made those celebrity puppets and killed them all was a riot as well. Best parts are all with the Kim Jon Il puppet. Very, very offense in everyway and if you can handle that sort of thing it's fine but sensitive people beware, this is not a rejected episode of Thunderbirds its way different. Good luck."
4,NOT FOR KIDS!!!,"My biggest concern after seeing this movie is that some parents will see it on the rental counter and take it home for their kids to watch. HUGE MISTAKE!!!Having said that, I thought this one was both hysterically funny at times and extremely crude at other times. Definitely worth seeing! I agree with what one other reviewer said about they could have used more voices. Also, what is it about Matt Damon being only able to say his own name?Also, Kim Jong-Il is one of the best movie villains of 2005! I've heard he loves Hollywood films. I'd dearly love to see his reaction after viewing this one!Funny, but PLEASE don't rent it for the kids!"
3,over the top fun,"Okay, when a friend recommended that I find and watch this funny little movie, I was intrigued. I knew that some of the subject matter was ""Over the top"", and to be quite honest,it did deliver.. I was more surprised with the great quality of this spoof comedy/romance/borderline naughty/ cartoon/movie, than what I had expected. If you want to laugh, and DON'T have young impressional children watching with you, I think you'll find the Risque humor funny, if you're into that kinda thing.I for one Laughed loudly."
4,THUNDERBIRDS on crack!,"If you're expecting high brow cinema from this flick, you outta have your head examined! Of course it's crude and vulgar! Of course it's out of bounds! That's the whole point, silly! It's like getting offended at a Don Rickles show!Personally, I loved it! The ""America, f*=@# yeah"" gung-ho anthem is a riot. So is the ""I'm so ronery"" bit, the towel turbaned guy, the puppet sex scene (make sure you get the unrated edition) and the F.A.G. jokes. Tasteless? Sure. Dead on target? Hillariously so. Politically inccorrect? Thank God, yes! Is that why so many of you are upset? I thought so...MAAAAAAATT DAAAAAMON!!! (he, he, he!) Get a life!"
2,whaaaatt,"Absolutely had to get this according to all the "" in"" people.Well , I have to take their ""taste"" from now on with a grain of salt.Am open to all kinds of movies ,from drawn out superslow Swedish art movies to bang em up vitrol violence ,and this is some kinda Kult movie ?Guess I'm not joiningDull and boringLost half my brain trying to find something to give me a smirkMost of the sex scene we already did at grade six in art classwith the teacher looking bored to deathJanK"
1,Tries to be THE SAME as Southpark...it's gotten boring and predictable,"There was a time when Tray Parker's and Matt Stone's humor was something fresh, something new that pull laughter out of the most unexpected places. This is laughably the SAME THING as South Park. With the SAME VOICE overs and TOO MUCH of the same crass humor. I should have listened to the reviews that say that some people never mature past 16, it looks more like 12 to me.It's just South Park with marionettes. These guys should call it quits. It has become boring. Their creativity has expired when it comes to making this kind of thing. Yes I looked for the nuances and the smart humor ""hidden"" within, yet is done so tastelessly that I cannot say I enjoyed it."
1,I fell asleep,America - F yea!That's the best part of the movie. I watched it due to the hype. How can so many people be wrong.
3,"Funny, but not as funny as South Park","This movie was funny, I would say the funniest part is when he was drunk after he quited and vomited for a long time and he passed out. But why did Gary had to do oral sex to the chief just so he can trust Gary. And when Gary was on the morticycle, the camera came too clse and made him fall. They should make the second movie of this, since Kim was a roach if you see the end. The sex part was wild too. But some people think this is stupid because it's all puppets, no actors."
3,Mostly just filthy,"Although some of the spoofing of America's position as the world policeman hits right on, much of the picture is just filthy. This actually limits the films effectiveness as the target audience is greatly reduced. To do this without the crutch of so much obscenity would have been the mark of a great piece of work and would have been much more effective and enduring. As it is, this is merely a period piece that will soon be forgotten."
2,Vulgarity Overshadows Message,"Yes there were some great political barbs but who wrote this, a pimply group of 13 year old boys? The ""gay"" theme and constant swearing were just too much to stomach. A shame because it really was a great idea, but it was sunk by a very puerile script."
2,"Uneven, would be better if edited","There certainly are funny parts in this movie and the satirical attacks on liberal Hollywood actors and actresses who think they have something worthwhile to say about politics are priceless. That being said, the crude vulgarity factor of the film is high (and disgusting). The ""F"" bomb is dropped so much that I was turned off. Body function scenes don't win Oscars from me either, so the film lost some stars from me over this, also. This could have been so much better if it had been less of a gross-out film and more of a satire."
2,targets are clear,"The politics of this film are quite clear. Just take a look at who's targeted. Cheney, Wolfowitz, and co are left alone while anyone who criticised the war in Iraq is presented as dim-witted friends of Kim Jong-Il. Neither the Bush government nor the Israeli government face any substantial critical commentary, while Arabs are represented on the whole as brainless psychopaths and anti-war activists as not much better.I must say that I am/was a fan of South Park, and I even laughed at Orgazmo. But this was not funny, indeed I'd be surprised if anyone bar the more jingoistic sections of American public found it so. I really can't see the joke in it."
2,Restraint?! I'll give you your restraint!,"Not that this needs another review, but...a lot of funny stuff here that would have been great at an R-rated level of grossness. The filmmakers could use a trusted friend who can say to them, uh, guys? This could still be funny and even a lot funnier (and to more people) if you'd just show an eensy-weensy bit of restraint. [...] It was a lot more than I needed to see. Similarly, the incessant F-bombs wear you out eventually. This is too bad because some of this stuff is hilarious, like the opening scene in which Team America ""saves"" Paris while destroying the Louvre and the Eiffel tower in the process, and the scene in which Kim Jong Il captures arms inspector ""Hans Brix."" Although it's ""ronery"" at the top, as Kim points out, this film spends a little too much time in search of the bottom, and then digging deeper when it gets there."
2,Eh?,"I used to be a big fan of ""South Park"". Then after I felt it ran its course after a couple seasons, it kept going and going and going, so eventually I stopped watching it (not having cable helps a lot). Anyway, ""Team America"" came out on DVD and I felt that since this was supposed to be a little more ""sophisticated"" than ""South Park"", I'd give it a shot.Amazingly, except for their parody of ""Rent"", the entire film was way too serious and straight and the novelty of having marionettes wore off after a few minutes. I was bored. I sped through the end. Sorry.Also, Trey Parker and Matt Stone should really work on some different character voices. All of their character voices sound like Terrance and Philip, and although those voices seem to work for those obnoxious characters from ""South Park"", they come off as extraordinarily irritating in ""Team America""."
2,Heck no!,"I agree with the person above who said that ""Team America"" was not very funny, especially compared to the creators' other movie, ""The South Park Movie."" Both feature vulgar dialouge and images, but only the latter is really witty.The first few moments of the movie seemed promising, but after the first fourth of the movie, things went downhill, relying on recycled crude jokes. I expected the humor to be potty-level, but it never elevated above that. Nor was their depth to the humor, as there is in the Simpsons or The Family Guy. In fact, this movie is worth flushing down the toilet.Good aspects of the movie: The set was creative, and it was an interesting and ambitious idea to use puppets instead of real actors or animation.I also recommend along with another comment-er that if you still desire to view this movie, that you rent the movie and not pay to see it at a theatre--and split the cost of the rental with friends, because otherwise you may still regret that you paid too much!"
2,Disappointing,"Team America is missable, not that funny and more than a little homophobic. ""But we make fun of everybody, like Janeane Garofalo!"" the filmmakers use as their defense. Yeah, but it's still homophobic. And not in a good way. Or a funny way. Or even in an outrageous way - it's just tired. Funniest bits are the songs and when they play up the limitations of using marionettes. The average South Park episode is a lot funnier."
1,UNBELIEVABLY Bad,"Wow. This is one of those films that you struggle trying to convey how bad it really is. But put it this way. I bought it on Pay Per View and downloaded to my DVR. After sitting through the first fifteen minutes (fast forwarding a lot), I finally gave up and just put it at x4 speed. It still dragged.If you're a South Park fan, don't think that this will automatically mean you'll like this movie. South Park is fast moving with some depth and wit. This film, despite being 3D puppets, is flat and wouldn't know wit if it blew it up (which happens a lot in this movie).It's not funny. It's not well done. It's a waste of time and money (I finally zipped through at x300. It still dragged).The bottom line? Don't bother."
1,The worst movie ever viewed,"What the movie is about, from what I gathered, is a team (World Police) that wants to kill off the terrorists. They want to recruit someone, and well, basically if you think of the typical format, you have the movie. guy comes in, doesn't want to join, later decides to, runs off, other guys in trouble, he comes back, has to save the day, and does.I am Conversation, and this is mostly bashing left wing liberals, but that didn't make a difference. This movie was horrible. If I was home, I would have turned this off within the first 15 minutes of it, but I was at my sisters house and I didn't have my car with me (under repairs), so there I sat, a whole 98 minutes of garbage.Watch American Carol with Kevin Farley. It's a ton better! That was a funny film. But this, way too vulgar, too stupid, no real creative, a very mature nude/love making scene. Too potty mouth!avoid!"
1,What???,"This has to be one of the dumbest movies I've ever seen!!! Not only were the wires that moved the puppets visible but the words never even matched up with the mouth movement. The only reason I watched this crap was because it was so stupid, I couldn't turn it off. The only thing that Trey and that other dipstick got right, was the Portrayal of Hollywood's group of Anti-American losers. WASTE OF MONEY!!! WASTE OF A MOVIE!!!"
1,"Over-hyped, predictable and childish","The problem with this film is not that Trey Parker and Matt Stone have taken a politically-incorrect stance in this film, that they attack popular entertainment figures, or that they are offensive and use stereotypes - these are all excusable with a good script. Sadly, contrary to everything said about this movie, the jokes are repetitive (think scene after scene of the same gags being wheeled out, puerile physical humour and bland, childish satire which misses the mark), and the puppets are poorly animated, often the source of ""look how jerkily they move"" comedy, which fails to impress. The problem with this movie is not that their understanding of world events is shallow and trite, and that they utterly miss the chance to make the audience think, or to use clever metaphor or satire, so much as that the jokes are universally bad. Worth watching only because it's popular and over-hyped; then to fight the corner of far funnier comedies which go unnoticed."
1,thinker,"This is the most vile movie I have ever walked out of.Low class boring, something only truly gutter based minds could think of.A true steaming pile....."
4,"America ""F"" YEAH!","I thought this was simply hilarious. If you like South Park and Trey Parker and Matt Stones sense of humor you will wet your pants on this one. The North Korean dictator is one of my personal favorites, ""Hans Brixxxxx (U.N. Weapons inspector Hans Blix). ""You're breaking my balls Hans, your breaking my balls."" There are so many funny things in this movie that I can't even go into it. It is a total take off on Jerry Bruckhiemer movies in it story and how the puppets talk and act. It is also a take off on the extreme stupidity on both the right and the left wing in American politics.AMERICA ""F"" Yeah!"
4,"Very, Very Funny",Team America is a riot. An over-the-top send-up of action films and politics it almost always hits its gag target for a good laugh.The puppet work is excellent and very expressive and the characters are voiced so well that at times you forget that you are watching marionettes.The sex scene is absolutely histerical as is the finale in South Korea. Highly recommended if you have a twisted sense of humor and a strong stomach.
3,Oscar Contender for Most Vulgar Movie Ever,"This movie was extremely inventive and entertaining at times, but the attempt to get the world record for crudeness was silly and immature. In other words, Middle Schoolers and low-achieving adults will flock to this movie in droves! The Pornographic doll sex, the puke (again!!!), and the record-breaking use of all types of vulgarity just wasn't for me. I did enjoy seeing all my favorite liberal movie star/political activists die horrible deaths, though, and the Kim Jung Il puppet was outstanding so this wasn't an entire waste of my money."
4,"Raunchy, Irreverent, Brilliant. Short Shelf-Life Puppet Comedy.","The creative crew behind South Park are raunchy, worse than irreverent, and often brilliant. This ain't for everyone, and I couldn't have sat through this with my kids (the scatalogico-sexual humor and profanities were just too much), but I'm glad I...(read more) saw it.Team America (""America, f*ck yeah!"") roots out evil wherever it be simultaneously leaving confusion and destruction in its wake. Not too hard to see a pointed criticism here. But lest the hawks feel picked on, the doves get theirs too - in spades. No one is spared. This film won't make much sense to most people in 20 years, but it does now. So if you can tolerate it, check it out before the shelf-life is up.And Kim Jong-il's solo, ""I'm So Ronery,"" is alone worth watching this filthy, delightful little show."
4,Funny,"Funny, Funny, Funny. Who knew puppets could kill or have sex. Never thought the muppets could kill or have sex than again I never really thought about either of those until I saw this, but hey you never know if these puppets can kill and have sex than the muppets and any other ones can do pretty much anything. I didnt get see it in the movies even thought Ive been working at the movies since July. But o well. Its funny. Im giving it 4 stars because I really think they didnt have to have the part where the male puppet giving the other male puppet a well if you saw the movie than you know what im talking about."
2,Boring,"This movie does not hold up over time. There are few laughs, but the profane songs will stick in your head long after it's over."
1,damaged,"had to send this one back, had a scratch on the disc and it wouldnt play past scene 5... bummer"
5,very cute,"This movie i've been searching for awhile to find. its so funny like family guy or american dad cartoon adult shows. these puppet/doll actors look so real that you forget they not really people actors once your drawn into the movies.a great movie for movie night,just a little something different to lighten the mood. can't wait to get it on dvd. i accidently purchased it for online streaming but it still had to buy the actual dvd for my movie collection."
5,"America, F*** Yeah!","As usual Trey Parker and Matt Stone have succeeded in creating a parody laden with comic genius. Not only is the war on terrorism put in it's place, but they also satirize a slew of other topics, such as politically outspoken actors and even the film industry its self with the use of mellowdramatic dialog and a cheesy (yet hysterical) soundtrack. The feature also feeds the need for more puppet movies. See this film, f*** yeah!"
5,some people just don't have a sense of humor,"this movie is not anti-america propaganda, its satire, its parody, and its damned funny, this movie is basically poking fun at all political views, and because that involves making fun of america people think it's anti-american, so now we can't even poke fun at ourselves, you know what happens when people don't have a sense of humor about themselves and their own beliefs? you get relgious extremists who generate enough hate to want to commit terrorist acts (for those of you not getting my hints i'm talking about our so called enemy) anyway all political ranting aside, this movie is almost guaranteed to offend people reguardless of political viewpoint simply because of the extremely crude humor, so if you can't stomach foul language or 10 min, of a drunken puppet spewing vomit then steer clear of this one, I however found this very funny and would reccomend it to anyone who can laugh at themselves and isn't easily offended"
5,THE GREATEST FU*KING FILM EVER,"I was skeptical when I went to see this movie, but after seeing it I couldn't stop laughing. Trey Parker delivers in this comedic masterpiece. Kim chong il is the most hilarious character in any movie I've ever seen, and the puppet sex scene is enough to make any movie a classic. Please go see this movie and support the creators so they can make more hilarious works of cinema"
4,* I Laughed My You-Know-What Off *,"This movie is crazy. It makes fun of everybody and that's what makes it great. You see everyone's faults. This movie is so damn gross, but it is funny. Not for the faint of heart! When I saw this at the movie theatre, I noticed a young boy there with his parents. I'm sure his parents were trying to cover his eyes and ears throughout the show ...A great laugh and oddly enough a very accurate view of the times we live in ... get this and laugh your you-know-what off."
2,Novel,"Haven't seen too many marionette films, so this was a newish format. I seem to remember something similar on British tv, quite a long time ago, for kids. If you're in the right mood you might find it fairly funny. However, come to think of it, I didn't laugh once. Like the Amazon man says, don't expect anything subtle. Although the politics may be different, this seemed to me to be in the vein of Blazing Saddles, which I found to be a seriously unfunny film. There's something about this style of American humour, which kills them over there, but which travels extremely badly to other parts of the globe; and I can't really recommend it to anyone outside the good ol' USA."
1,Awful,"Even for a movie starring puppets, it's terrible. By about 30 minutes in, the movie has lampooned every detail of bad 80s action movies. But then it goes on for another tortuous hour."
2,"Disappointing, good ideas that are wasted!","The sets for the movie, the puppet designs are great. So what went wrong? 1. The voice dubs all sound the same, they didn't use enough actors. 2. I would feel ripped off If I spent money in the theatre, it has a low budget bad movie feel to it. 3. South Park characters rock!! The characters in this movie are boring and you start to look at your watch hoping the torture of watching will end soon. There are some funny explicit scenes such as exaggerated sex scenes and gratuitous violence, but not enough to make it worth while. Don't waste your time!"
2,overrated crap...,"These guys are geniuses, but they're capable of better. The movie was -- believe it or not -- BORING at times, and it could have used more jokes. (Michael Moore strapping a bomb to himself and blowing up T.A. headquarters is technically not a joke. It could have used an extra twist.) The songs are funny, the politics are Parker and Stone's usual 14-year-old pseudo-nihilism, though they don't make ANY effort to lambast the right wing with the same tenacity that they do Tim Robbins and Sean Penn. There wasn't a single f'ing rightwing celebrity blown apart in this movie (and yes, there are many), and I wanted to see the Sam Jackson puppet take a howitzer to little marionette versions of Trey Parker and Matt STone. Now THAT would be a movie.I also find it retarded that anyone could make a ""satire"" (their words, not mine) on the war on terror without even mentioning Bush."
1,Way south of Southpark - thankfully I rented this,"I gave up on this movie halfway through and sent it back. I expected stinging satire of American politics, but what I got was lame & predictable, with adolescent body function jokes and over use of the 'F' word. As Cartman would say, ""this is a piece cr*p man'"
5,This Reflects World Perception of The USA - Learn From It!,"This movie hits the spot! It reflects exactly how the rest of the world sees the self-obsessed insular culture of the USA. I love the subtitle ""Panama Canal - Central America (1093 miles south of the REAL America)"" it says everything it needs to say in that one subtitle...!The USA needs to learn that there is a world outside North America and that world generally classes Americans as gung-ho morons. And the rest of the world generally do not class actors as potentially powerful political figures....?!?I remember walking out of the cinema and saying to my friend - ""That wouldn't have gone down too well in the States. I think they wouldn't have understood half of the satire and just translated it as plain offensive, probably even purile"".What else do I need to say..?"
1,Terribly unimaginative,"If this movie tries to be satirical parody, it fails. None of the real life characters portrayed are parodied in the least, no attempt is even made to mimick their language. The closest you come to any real parody is the gibberish of other languages when the arabs say ""mohammed jihad"". Ha ha very witty. Well maybe Michael Moore is slightly parodied: he carries hot dogs because he's fat. The characters themselves are weak, none of them are memorable. Kim-jong il not only has the mannerisms, but also the voice of Cartman from Southpark. I expected this movie to be something it's not: a daring and funny movie with witty insights into the crazy world around us."
1,bad movie,"this is the worst movie i have seen in a long whilethis movie was crap: everyone for who want's to buy itwait for par per veiw --- it will be chraper and u will thank me, - just plain bad wish amazon had 1/2 stardoes not desever even 1 star"
4,Understand what this film is and isn't,"This film is essentially a parody of action films, and it does that pretty well. If you think this film is a political satire, you're going to be disappointed because its political commentary is about on the same level as a Dirty Harry movie. Sure, it takes some quick whacks, but that's about it; even South Park episodes explore issues to a much greater extent."
4,Un-Politically correct- and better for it!,"If you were brought up on the puppet shows of the 60's and 70's like Thunderbirds, Fireball XL5, and Stingray, I guarantee you will love this.This is very much puppetry for adults. Every theme is explored, including some very dubious (though hilarious) sexual practices!The lampooning of Political figures is spot on, though the portrayal of the USA zapping everyone they dislike may not sit too well with some US viewers.This is belly laughs for the boys with a few beers inside them.Relax, and enjoy..."
3,Send this to Kim Jong Il,"...is what I say.Would he find yet one more reason to eschew Westernization? Would he even understand the type of brain damage it takes to make something like this? Team America is a failure, more or less, but how do you top the South Park movie in terms of grossing out, offending your audience and having time to satirize everything under the sun in between? Simple. You have marionettes...wait,I don't think I can get away with mentioning what Parker and Stone do with them here. You just won't believe it. You could skip this one, in all honesty, but you won't be angry if you do buy it."
1,this movie stinks...zero stars,"Don't buy this movie...don't even rent it...I maybe laughed once throughout the entire film...the idea that actors/actresses could support terrorists behind our backs through this ""underground network"" is absurd and ludacris...NO ONE wants to see terrorists take over our country in any way, shape or form...thats why this movie has no intelligent thing to say about foreign policy or any other political agenda actors or actresses may have. It's zero stars if I could give it that."
1,offensive,"I find the puppet sex offensive. I find the ending speech offensive. I guess that the excuse for this movie is "" humor "" or ""satire"". It's a classic children's format corrupted. Oh, I forgot the violence, but I guess that is also "" funny "".Clark Conway"
1,GAY!!!,"My step-dad said I had to watch this ""f***ing"" hilarious movie...well, I did, and I could not stomach anymore of it after about 30 minutes of aggonizing terror!! Terrible...stupid...not funny at all....sorry!!Christopher Berry"
1,The most offensive movie I've ever seen,"And not only that, it's just bad. And very hateful. Such infantile trash should be banned from the screen. I would have walked out after just 15 minutes, but my friend, who was laughing hysterically, inststed that we stay. It was torture. Truly abhorrent work with no redeeming value."
1,This is not a movie for your Children,"I was entirely fooled by the innocent ""look"" of the movie. There should be a warning on it for parents. I am sure many families have accidently rented this for their children. It disguises itself as a Childrens movie which it is not. Don't expect your child to retain any last shred of innocence after seeing this movie.There is some decent slapstic comedy here, some of it original, some overused (such as a long vomit scene), much of it unecessarily offensive, violent, and abusive. Too bad, the producers have talent that could have made a quite enjoyable movie with more mature editing. Unfortunately that did not happen.I would not have made it through half of this movie except I was fascinated by the social implications of a movie like this being ""mainstream"". In that way this movie was indeed interesting, but also disturbing."
4,"Very Funny, With Offensive Balance","Team America is terribly offensive if you are: conservative, liberal, Middle Eastern, American, Hispanic, Oriental, Male, Female, Homosexual, Heterosexual, Peaceful, Violent, etc., etc. It doesn't favor any side. It makes fun of everyone and if you watch it with an open mind you can see that everyone deserves some making fun of. There are stuff that I believe that were lampooned in this movie, but I still loved it. I laughed out loud many times the first time I saw it. It's puppets and if you're really offended by puppets then maybe you can see the unreality that we place on many of the things in the news and in our lives. Look at it from an outside perspective. Many of the things in our lives that can be so important turn out to be puppets, false feelings or motivations that eventually dissipate. Watch the movie with an open mind. It makes fun of mindless action movies and it will make you laugh very hard. I think it's great."
5,"Man, the Left has changed since the 60's...","When did ""liberals"" become such prissy tight-asses? God forbid they should be the subject of satire... puts 'em right off their vente decaf mocha latte's, that does..."
5,Hilarious!!! Sometimes you just need to laugh!,"I thought this movie was extremely creative and funny. Yeah it's a satire of political and worldly ideas and events, but come on people sometimes you just have to let go and laugh about the goings on in the world! If you go into this movie criticizing it and viewing it as propaganda, then you will be extremely offended and dissapointed. It's a movie made to be hilarious satire and that's exactly what it is. I laughed so hard I cried throughout the entire film!"
5,Unique and Refreshing!,"The only criticism I have for Trey Parker and Matt Stone is that they don't make movies often enough. Their blunt, in-your-face crudeness and blatant disregard for anything deemed sacred by the masses is priceless and they don't fail to deliver in Team America: World Police.The songs in the movie are pure genius. I about fell off my chair during the ""Everybody Has AIDS"" Broadway number and Kim Jong Il's ""I'm So Ronrey"" is funny and almost downright adorable.The DVD of Team America: World Police is packed with lots of goodies. The behind-the-scenes extras are informative and really show you the time, effort and imagination that goes into creating a marionette movie.Team America: World Police delivers foul language, puppet vomit (an overkill of puppet vomit, I might add), gory puppet violence, wicked crazy puppet sex and a puppet Michael Moore. What more could you ask for?"
3,"Not their best, but laugh 'til you cry any how","An amazing technical achievement, sure to please fans of Godzilla, StingRay, and Thunderbirds, especially when the film version of ""Thunderbirds"" wimped out and did NOT use puppets. I thought ""Not their best writing, not their best songs, but I'm still in tears laughing!"" What made ""South Park, Bigger, Longer, Uncut"" so funny was that it was a rich raunchy parody of various Broadway hits. ""Team America"" was political satire, and altho that is simpler, the boys manage quite a feat in walking a fine line politically - while we laugh at the dumbness of the ""Team America"" squad as it obliviously does as much damage as the terrorists, we also laugh as they fight the comically stereotyped Hollywood liberals."
4,"Sex, Violence, Puppets - Who Can Resist?","No question this in one of the more anarchic cult films released over the last decade, though oddly, it did not do well in wide release. Beats me how anyone could resist an obscenity-laced, scatological puppet show that features copulating marionettes. Of course, the true controversy was that it was - gasp - politically satirical (nearly unheard of in American movies these days, but then, we live in a time where it seems to be dangerous to have an original, if candid, opinion about anything, much less politics). Is ""Team America"" good for what ails you? Probably not, but it is good for some gut-diving laughter. Come on, admit it, you're dying to sneak a peek, and alot of folks probably will when this hits DVD. Finally, America will know the truth about itself: we're a nation of closeted puppet-sex fiends. Amen to Parker and Stone for liberating us."
3,Kinda Funny,"3 and a half stars for me, please. There is no real reason for this to be uncensored, but it just did not turn out to be as funny as I hoped. Don't get me wrong...it's still entertaining. This is how things are when you mix terrorism with celebrities and Kim Jong Il with marionettes. That's it. All I can really say is that I'm at a total loss to describe this movie. I can relate most to Kim Jong Il's feelings............""MATT DAMON!!"""
3,"Funny movie, pokes at a lot of different current events","The South Park guys are genius IMO and this seemed to me to be their big foray into current events satire.Quite a number of classic scenes, songs, and lines...and wow, the things they do with marionettes."
4,Hilarious,"This movie is hilarious! It's not something I'd watch over and over again, but I occasionally put it in and watch it and still get quite a few laughs!"
5,just for funs,"I love team america, if you ever watched the Thunderbirds when you were a child will enjoy it very much. If you are looking for art cinema you should pass."
5,Too Funny !,Great movie. I love the southpark guys. I also own Southpark the Movie and a few other Southpark videos. Great !
2,Mildly entertaining...............for just one viewing,I waited until now to purchase 'Team America' the unrated version just when it was the right price. I got for $4.99. I have read the reviews and spoke to friends who had seen it and thought it might be worth owning it. I was wrong....upon watching it I realized it just wasn't that funny. Sure an occasional laugh here and there and ofcourse the sex scene was out of this world but that was it. I must admit the puppet masters did a great job but is this film worth watching more than once....I don't think so.
3,Some very strong moments between long waits,"The movie lampoons many supposedly taboo subjects:- That anything is ok in the pursuit of weapons of mass destruction.- Liberal actors spouting nonsense.- Michael Moore.- Uber-patriotic redneck music.- Failures of the US intelligence system.Both sides of the political spectrum get the axe.Mixed in with this, are several other funny scenes. (Puppet sex that wouldn't be worthy of even a single X rating, Spoofs of Kill Bill and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon)Unfortunately, the message would have fit better into an episode of South Park (home of the creators) as there were long waits between satiric spots. It was as if there were the usual 22 minutes of comedy, but Hollywood required that the movie last as least 90 minutes. That made for a painful wait. When I find myself asking, ""When will it be funny again?"" that is a bad sign, despite the importance of the message."
2,Not enough info. in description,"I'm sure these cables would work fine if I were actually able to install them onto my bike. The problem is that the product description said nothing about what kind of tip they have - disc or nipple. Turns out they have nipple tips, which don't work with my shifters. That would have been nice to know. However, considering they were so cheap, I'm really not too upset about it."
2,Ran dry too quickly,"Purchased this and was very excited for a new ink color rather than the standard black. Unfortunately, the Ink ran dry in less than a month"
3,"OK, nothing new",Mostly the same old tricks and tips- although I did get probably $4 worth of tips. I would have rather spent the money on a magazine subscription.
5,Bachmanns N scale Platform Station,"It looks great, the scale plausible. The true test is will it foul large cars (Derail)Passing by it on a curve. This is a very good model. I got another. It is just right, as is, or can be kit-bashed well.You can not go wrong with this, especially if you are pressed for space."
2,Poorly designed,"Why oh why would they place the power switch right where your fingertips curl around the handle? Guess what happens - on, off, on off, on off, on off. It's a terrible design.If I still had the box I would return it and get a different model.Functionality is fine though - it dries my hair - so we'll see how long it lasts with the constant restarting."
2,"Loud, Frizzy hair","I have owned this dryer for over a year, and although it is still working I need to get a new one. The dryer is very loud (and that is my primary reason for getting rid of it). I have very thin hair and I use expensive Bumble and Bumble products on my hair and my hair always ends up being frizzy after I dry it with this dryer. It ""gets the job done"" but my hair is always a tangled mess after I dry it."
3,Songs of pain,"The guy's life story is definately interesting, and so is his music. Johnston has an ear for great melodies, and though his lyrics are somewhat simplistic, they are quite unique.In the end this won't be a record I'll put on very often. His high-pitched voice is too irritiating, the vast amount of songs spunds too much alike, and the overall sound quality is too poor."
5,great for kids and adults !,"i originally bought this for my 6 year old-he is not able to read all the words yet-but that is helped by the voice over. he has been able to find probably 90 % of the items without my help-what a great mind-builder for kids ! now he has my 4 year old on the computer with him looking for objects-great educational tool-it really expands their vocabulary --and it's addicting for the parents,too !"
3,Fun yet disappointing graphic,"Very enjoyable. Yet mildly disappointed by the graphic. It seems to have a resolution of 800x600, something dated 2000."
5,I Spy Treasure Hunt,"This is the 3rd I Spy I have bought for my granddaugher, who is 7 yrs old. When all else fails to entertain, we go to the computer and challenge one another in finding the hidden objects. Not always an easy job, but a lot of fun. It has helped with her reading skills and her observation skills."
5,A Great Reminder,Watched this with a few friends and there wasn't a dry eye. It was a great reminder of the importance of the Great Commission. We take the final directive of Jesus and treat it like it's optional.
5,Excellent,"I am not an evangelic guy, but the facts presents by Mr. Giglio area a real proof of the existence of GOD. I thank him to be part of my life; I am a Christian person."
5,How Great Is This Guy,Anything Louie is involved with is good. I will be getting this soon and reccomend it to all my friends and family.
4,Guitar Wolf- J-pop that kicks your @$$!,"Guitar Wolf is a trio from Japan whose metal-punk noise is so intense it deserves a medal. To everyone who remembers Metallica's ""Kill 'Em All"" or the '80's punk and wants to hear more... these gurentai are for you. Remember, that's Guitar Wolf- J-pop that kicks your @$$"
3,The Wolf Rocks!,NOw this is pretty intense stuff. While I agree they are extremey derivative from the Ramones mainly they manage to be less well produced than their heroes who in comparison sound like they were quite polished. Still quite fun to listen to their japanese brand of garage punk.
5,fastloudrawenergeticcreativechaoticjetmusic!!,"remain calm: your speakers are not blown; it's g-wolf's new album! and it rocks! g-wolf are back again with more creative chaos to scare your girlfriends away. if i find a girl who digs 'em, i'll marry her. brilliant organized noise that's louder than a harley without headers. seiji's distorted but catchy japenglish vocals will get you singin along even when you can't understand a word. my fav's: 'roaring blood', 'gakulan rider', 'can-nana fever', 'refrigerater zero' and, well, all of 'em. cochran's summertime blues was very fun with some new lyrics goin' on. the only thing wrong with this album is that it ends."
4,LOUD,"This album is so LOUD that its LOUDness can only be accurately expressed by spelling LOUD entirely in capital letters. It is also incomprehensible, ear-splitting, misanthropic, headache-inducing, and frequently flirts dangerously with the ridiculous; ie, its great rock n roll (or as the Wolf might put it, its kick-a## motorcyle teenage leather-boy atomic rock). Buy it, crank it up and do permanent damage to your stereo AND your central nervous system - allright!!"
4,music stile,"As other Anderas compositions this cd reflects a mix between world cultures. If you focus closely in every detail of the music you will travel in time. The music contained in this cd is beatufull, is deep, is envolvent. I strongly recommend this cd to New Age music lovers."
5,Classic Disco done classically,"Where do I start? In the mad gay oriented daze of disco, there were a few pure music driven composers/producers. Of these the greatest were Giorgio Moroder, Alec R. Costandinos and...Boris Midney. Like Barry White, Boris took the basic 4/4 disco dance rhythm and turned it into a hypnotic experience. Purely melodic, Boris managed to compose long dance tracks which gave the dance crowd time to get into the deceptively simple tracks and raise themselves into a state of pure dancing ecstasy. These tracks show off the brilliance of a man who truly believes that dance music can be both energizing and intelligent."
3,Not bad,"I've only read _Caliban's Hour_ by Tad Williams but I liked that much better than this book. I've also read some shorter works by Hoffman which I've had mixed feeling on. This seemed more like a long, short story. It did seem rushed because there was a lot in the story. A main setting of some men having dinner and then one of them telling a story and then the characters in that story telling many stories.As confusing as that sounds it wasn't a confusing read. I like the arabian setting and it was funny at times but nothing really impressed me about it, except for one of the stories told within the main story.I think it would be more impressive for someone just getting into fantasy as opposed to a veteran. Though as the last reviewer mentioned it may not correctly represent Williams' 'normal' style of writing."
3,"Album wasnt well executed, but Anthology is better","I have the disco album, and I played it back in the 70s. It was filler. Like disco muzak during early happy hour. The album itself was not a good package, however the two tracks, ""Star Wars Theme"" & ""Darth Vadar March"" are included in Boris Midney's Anthology 2-disc collection, which makes it sound better since it is mixed in with many of his side groups, plus his own releases under his name. The songs on the 2-disc are fun since there are collections from Caress, USA European Connection, Beautiful Bend, Festival, Double Discovery, and a few others that bared his name as producer. So the two tracks taken from Empire Strikes Back disco album was included in the two disc, which actually makes them sound alot better and more enjoyable. But the album here was technically bland."
1,worst LP in my vinyl collection,"I have been ripping all my old vinyl into digital. Came across this from 1980, when I was heavily into Meco and his catalog of science-fiction theme disco albums. This falls far short of that, and is probably the worst album I have ever owned. It is neither fun to listen to from a Star Wars sense nor is it really even danceable from a disco sense. Nothing innovative here. Check out Meco if you're interested in space disco of the era."
2,Not a real 'how to' DVD,"I thought I would be getting an instruction DVD, not one made like an after-school-special!It's made like a little story, not a regular how-to DVD"
5,Good Grief,"I don't think the child who wrote the review has any concept of ballet whatsoever. If she did, she would know there is a crossed fourth, open fourth, a fifth and open fifth positions of the arms. And for her information, it is not an elementary DVD, so they have good reason to leave battements tendu out as a solo movement exercise as it is too simplistic for the target audience of the DVD."
4,Schylling Tent,I bought this tent for my twin grandsons 2nd birthday. They loved it. It is very durable and well made.
3,Mega Tent Review,I bought the tent for my grandson.He is enjoying it immensely. However the floor of the tent should be more firm to prevent it from toppling over so easily.
2,Waste of Money! Not worth the price!,"I bought this for my 4 year old son and he loved it but it broke after one time of using it and once we folded it down, it never popped back up correctly. It would have been a lot of fun if it had lasted. Very disappointed in it, especially for the price we paid. Don't waste your money!!"
2,Changed my mind...,"I bought this for my 20 month old grandson who immediately fell in love with it - as did I since it was so easy to put up and easy enough to put away - BUT ONLY TWICE! The third time, 4 different adults tried to fold it back up over and over and over without success. We cannot understand what happened to it. Something is preventing it from folding up and I am incredibly disappointed in this product."
2,Well Researched but Tedious and Dry,"This book contains a wealth of information about warfare and weapons in the Middle Ages, but it reads like it was written for an academic audience. Therefore, I believe that non-specialists (like myself) will find the material dry and filled with far too many details of little interest, even for those who are genuinely interested in learning more about the way that warfare was conducted in the Middle Ages."
2,Avoid!,"While the author surely knows his material, the presentation is dry, tedious and completely uninspired. It is not a book for beginners either--readers need quite a background before even going into this book."
1,Yuck.,"We purchased all the books to this, student text, teacher's manual, and lab book.This really is very poorly put together. We sent it back the same day it arrived. Poorly put together, no explanations, text all runs together... no in-depth study...I would never purchase again or recommend this to anyone."
1,Remakes!,This album is a pure disappointment!! These are not the original hit recordings that you used to listen to on the radio back in the 60's. And most don't have the same energy the originals had. Some artists make several recordings of the same song as a matter of normal practice. Don't waste your money!
1,Big Disappointment,This is without a doubt the worst CD of new recordings by the original artists that I have ever had the misfortune to purchase. My only hope is that others will heed the reviews on this CD and spend their money on better quality products not associated with MADACY Special Products.
1,Save Your Money!,"I saw the words ""original artists"" and thought I was buying a CD of the original hits. WRONG! Even if they are the original artists (and I have my doubts) - this is akin to getting watered down instant coffee when you were expecting fresh brewed Costa Rican! If you grew up listening to the TRULY original hits, then don't even think about purchasing this CD because it will depress you. On the other hand, if you are totally unfamiliar with the originals, you might find this to be... just o.k."
3,THIS KARMA CHAMELEON KEEPS ON CHANGING!!,"Boy George may truly be turning into the king of catchy dance music, its just a shame he doesn't get the airplay or club play he deserves. If you are into obscure dance music with an edge this is the song for you."
4,"Good book, but subjective","This is an enjoyable, easy-to-read book. It is truly amazing to read about all the different practices that we have been through in terms of giving birth and how medicalized it has become. While many have objected to the reviewers who indicated that that this book is slanted toward midwifery, the fact is that the book does take a not-so-subtle position. It's not bad to take a position, but the book purports to be more of an objective history, which it is not entirely. Keep in mind that I'm a strong advocate for natural birth, with midwifery as one of the options for natural birth. But I did anticipate a more objective view from a journalist's perspective. Her slant proves the point that it is hard for anyone to be truly objective in terms of birth."
3,"Interesting, but mild",This book would have been better if it had more actual history in it and specific case histories to explain how history has treated the birth process.
3,Not for faint of heart,"Please do not buy this book for pregnant women, although you will be tempted. It is scholarly and full of information, but in my opinion way too gory for women getting ready to birth and for me, even a few years after birthing. At some points it seemed like a showcase of horrors. Some of the things I learned about birthing practices in the past, I wish I hadn't."
3,Got an agenda?,"Fascinating pop-history of childbirth across time and culture. On the other hand,I'm still waiting for a book that calls the modern maternity system on it's shortcomings and betrayal of women, without making me feel like I'm a koolaid drinking dummy for wanting an epidural.No luck so far!"
3,not all that,"The NY TImes review made it sound great. But, regretably, it wasn't a page grabber for me. That said, for someone who is anticipating giving birth, i bet it'd be fascinating."
3,An unsubtle bias,"I'm interested to hear if any fellow readers share my view that this book, while well researched and written, is INCREDIBLY slanted toward the natural childbirth perspective, and judgmental of women who have epidurals. After stating that 90 percent of American women choose this option, she goes on to state that epidurals have ""taken the work out of labor"" and replaced ""chants, herbs and breathing techniques"" with ""a kit and a power button."" Not only does this otherwise thorough book about the history of childbirth not explore the current trend that equates pain relief in childbirth with moral weakness, but the author also spends some time soul-searching about if whether she should have ""succumbed"" to the epidural in her own birth experience. Give me a break. I'm tired of the epidural being spoken about as some dangerous drug hocked by evil doctors, when to my mind, it's a great humanitarian advance for those who choose it (again, 90% of American women)."
3,Birth and stories around the process,"I thought this book was going to be a study of infants in the womb and the 'connect' that happens between mother and child. Rather it was a history of the labor process, medical and practical. Not that , that particular subject is a bad one but I was mislead by the cover a little bit."
4,"Not quite a laugh a minute, but a good read","I must confesss, which is fitting, that I grew up at the same time in the Midwest as these authors.However, my ancestors are Swedish and we lived in Iowa. You wouldn't think this would make a difference, but it does.The only thing I can say is that you had to have been there to completely understand this book. And maybe that won't do it.There was a comment somewhere that said you can't understand it unless you've had beets or Jello melt into your scalloped potatoes on a paper plate."
4,Grew up Lutheran.,"I enjoyed this book well enough to send a copy of it to my Father and an Aunt, who also grew up Lutheran. They enjoyed it, too."
4,Right on Target,"While the focus of the book is on Lutherans who grew up from the 40s to 60s I must confess that having grown up as the daughter of 2 Lutheran pastors, having worked at a Lutheran bible camp in college where i would go lead VBS at lutheran churches in Minnesota and having graduated from a lutheran college that it still pin points humor about the general Lutheran culture. It does not matter if you are in tune with all of the theology or church politics or not--people who both embrace and reject their Lutheran heritage will still appreciate this book! I must admit that while it was not always humourous and that it is more historical than modern that it did pin point observations with humor that i am currently struggling with while debating whether or not to follow through on attending Lutheran seminary relatively soon. I found it right on target and extremely therapeutic.Also recommended: Garrison Keillerand more Lutheran congregants should read Jim Wallis and SOjourners magazines!!"
2,Amazon specifications unreliable,"I bought this monitor based on the advertised premise that it was a high grade .22mm dot pitch CRT. Upon opening the box I realized I'd been had; the box is clearly marked .26mm dot pitch. To make matters worse I paid $30 extra for 2nd day delivery only to have it take 5 days to be delivered.I rate this transaction 2 thumbs down. If it weren't for my desperate need to have a working monitor to aid my physical imparement, I would return this in a heart beat. Amazon, you should be ashamed of yourself!"
4,Hilarious,"I like to view it now and then..so many funny consequences from so many people ..particulary Walter Matthau,and Cosby and Pryor"
5,Funny as Hell!!!,"This movie is a classic for the great dark comedies of the 20th. century, The acting is great, the story line is deep and hilariously funny. Recommend this movie for everyone. Buy it from Koshi, great customer service and quality products. Quick delivery."
3,Hilarious 'B' movie,I'm not even sure how many people have seen this film but it's one of the Cosby/Pryor great connections. Michael Caine was bi-sexual and married to an Oscar nominated actress; way ahead of its time.
3,Memory Lane,"I remember going to see this movie with my mom when it came out back in '78. Even as a 13 year old, I recognized the brilliance of Maggie Smith and Michael Caine. I couldn't wait for them to come back on the screen. Their dialogue crackled and was a lot of fun to watch. The rest of the cast, although brilliant in their own right, didn't have much to work with in this film. The Bill Cosby/Richard Pryor bit was silly then and I'm sure that I'd find it even sillier now. I remember laughing just at Walter Matthau's facial expressions more than the situation his character was in. I will watch this one again as a 46 year old and see if it holds up."
2,Disappointed,"This ""dictionary"" is extremely non-descriptive. It supplies the latin names, but will define them only as a deciduous tree, or a flowering shrub. That does not explain to me what it looks like compared to other plants. It also has no pictures, so there is no help there. If you want to really learn the latin names of plants, spend the extra money for an illustrated and more desciptive reference dictionary."
2,Go with the Sony brand,"I thought it would be a good idea to save a few bucks and buy the aftermarket batteries. I was wrong. I bought two of these and though they function well, they do not hold as much charge as the Sony battery that came with my camcorder. I would not buy these again and would instead pay the premium price for the Sony brand batteries. When I pull out the camcorder to shoot video after a few weeks of being in the bag, I expect it to work. That does not happen when I used these batteries."
3,By The Sample Songs It Sounds Pretty Good,By listening to the sample songs it sound like an pretty good cd... so i think i will buy it and check it all out... and see if i bumps... it's gotta bump to get 5 stars!!
4,"hey Amazon, wake up!",Why in God's name is this collection of 1930s records listed as a Bee Gees item with Bee Gees reviews?!
2,Disappointing,"While I enjoyed the allusions to A Midsummer Night's Dream, one of my favorite Shakespeare plays, I found this book far from satisfying. Craig evokes the Italian landscape beautifully, but I couldn't get past my disgust with some of the characters. Betty is horrid, but she's supposed to be; the problem is with characters we're meant to view sypathetically. Polly is a spritless doormat, only slightly evolved by the end of the book, and her two children are among the most hateful, odious brats I've ever seen in fiction. Craig apparently writes children's books as well as reviewing them; I hope she doesn't think all children are as rude and insensitive as those she portrays here. Quite polluted an otherwise pleasant read."
2,Wish it had been more than it is,"On the surface, this story seems to have it all to make a highly appealing read. The setting is Italy, the cast of characters large and diverse, ranging from precocious children to rich, mean mother-in-law. The relationships shift, and love is explored. What's not to like, right? Yet it never lived up to my expectations. It took me forever to finish it, because I was never fully drawn to the characters or the plot, and therefore never had that wonderful feeling of not being able to put the book down. Rather, I felt it more of a duty to finish it because I had started it. When I finished the book, I felt underwhelmed. I was surprised to read that it's a favorite of book clubs. Maybe it gives people an excuse to have their friends over for Italian food. Overall I am sorry to say I was disappointed."
1,A mid-summer trainwreck!!!,"Oh, please! The reviews of this book made me laugh! Romantic Comedy? That in itself is a joke. I disliked this book very much. It was a major effort to even finish it!"
3,Smile.,"Guys... if you have a INSECURE WOMAN, this book is great. If you have a curiosity with most American women, this is also great ! She gives alot of insight on how the womans mind works... however... the way it is written, shows me that this woman isnt that grounded. However, She does have good intensions, and I wish her the best for sharing this information with an open heart. I cant tell you on this page all of where I stage my thoughts. However, studying people from a more grounded foundation, ( by that I mean, prizing family value above all else) we can see in this book what are some of the common thought patterns of most women today. This book will help you in identifying some indicators to look for. Just my opinion..."
3,hmm cost fishy,"a lot of people complaining about the price (I agree - way out of bounds for this type of book) but the back cover has an MSRP of $17.95US? what gives?I'd buy this if (a) it was on Kindle and (b) it was 17.95having scanned the first few pages, the format/dialogue is a bit contrived (agree with previous reviewer) but she's fairly right on about most if not all points.Poor Kevin. He seems pretty in the dark."
2,Can't afford it,"I'd love to read it, but I can't afford it. Why is this so expensive? I'll give it two stars because I like what she said on her website, but a book that's only 200 pages written by someone with no training is questionable. Highly questionable. She should bring the price in line with regular books and allow it to sell on it's own merit."
3,No solution,"This book describes my situation perfectly, but I am still in limbo. It didn't offer me a realistic solution to my problem and so I am still stuck. This book probably helps men of wives who cheat, but as the woman I still don't know what to do."
1,Worthless,"A complete waste of time and money. This book offers no real insight into what most people think and feel and certainly offers no real guidance or help to any persons who have been affected by an extramarital affair. Half-truths, suppositions and illogical conclusions. At times the author completely contradicts herself from one chapter to the next. I got the impression that the author was no fan of the male members of our species and in the end, offers no real solutions."
5,the brutal truth,"As I read the ""stages of infidelity"" described by the author mild nausea reinforced the realization that I was reading an exact description of what happened to my marriage. After awhile my wife announced that she needed to move out to ""find herself"" (just another stage guys). Actually it was a result of my demands that she end it with the other man or else....As a person of faith I do not agree with all the premises that Ms. Langley proposes but I can tell you that her description of what happens, and why, was such an accurate description of my experience that it was disturbing. If really want to know what a woman means when she says ""I'm not happy"" you better read this."
3,"It's very good, but not their best","What I like most about the S-E-X-X-Y single is the song ""We've Got A World That Swings"". The other songs, especially ""Unforgotten"" are also good, but the remix of S-E-X-X-Y by Warren Rigg is terrible. It sounds like techno teenybopper crap. On a whole, however, it is a worthwhile disc."
4,"Annoying remix, but otherwise great","The title track here is, of course, ""S-E-X-X-Y,"" the lead song on Factory Showroom. While a good song, this would not have been my choice for a single, and the techno remix that made it onto the EP is long and tedious. As is usual with TMBG EP's, though, the B-sides are the highlights here. It is hard to say anything against the rocking ""SenSurround"" or the bubbly cover of ""We've Got A World That Swings."" ""Unforgotten"" occasionally ventures into cheesy lyric territory (""I know your new boyfriend, and you belong with him""), but it is still a decent song. Overall, this is definitely a wise buy for TMBG fans."
5,Bespoke,"""Sensurround"" can, I think, be counted among the very best by TMBG. It's utterly beyond me why the song didn't appear on Factory Showroom. The rest of the disc is decent...if you like Flansburgh ballads (I don't, but hey, it takes all kinds) you'll love ""unforgotten."""
3,"Great size box, but really needs a handle!","I purchased this box as a treasure box for my older son (6) to keep his favorite things safe from his 3-year-old brother. The box is an excellent size, and has a simple enough locking mechanism for a child to manage (and has an extra key for a parent to keep in case the first key gets lost!) The box seems sturdy and is nice looking.My only cons: 1. It really needs a handle, even when used as it is intended as a media lock box. 2. While the locking mechanism is simple enough for a child, it clearly is not meant as more than token security if used by an adult.I liked the box enough, that we purchased a handle and mounted it on the top of the box by drilling holes through the top and screwing the handle attachments in. We accomplished this without damaging the box at all. Overall, my son loves it!"
2,hard to tune up and stay in tune,"I bought it for my daugter who start to learn a violin.For a really beginner, it is so so.But after a half year, it is not good.And originally it is hard to tune up and also hard to stay in tune.For 1 year, it is same price to buy this and rent a good one.But if you have some kids to start, it is worth to buy for them to play for one year each."
2,Inexpensive instrument that cost more to get into playing condition to play it than to purchase it.,"From day one this violin would not stay in tune on the D string. Took it to be looked at and had to have new pegs and a new bridge. Nice looking instrument but disappointed I had to shell out even more money to get it into playing condition.After 2 months of having this violin we had an ""issue"" with it during a violin lesson. My son was putting his bow up to play something that his teacher had ask him to play and we heard a popping sound and the whole area where the fine tuner was popped off and slapped him in the side of the face. His teacher who is a professional violinist had never seen anything like that before."
3,BBC (Bit Bland Compilation) Arabic Jukebox,"This CD is pleasant enough, but it's not quite the authentic Arabic music I was looking for. It is not nearly so dreadful as one of those 'Chill' or 'Groove' CDs which are just generic pap with a smattering of exotic colour, but the western influence (dance beats, synthesizers etc) was overpowering. Perhaps that's what the Arab world is listening to, and there's nothing wrong with that- there is always a place for cross-cultural musical hybrids. However, I was looking for distinctly Arabic rhythms, which were largely missing from this disc, although the melodies and vocal patterns sounded authentic enough."
3,Solid,"Yes I know about jazz and yes this music is based on the music of Miles Davis from the 60s Quintet and it doesn't take any degree of musical skill to be able demonstrate this fact by noting its forms and harmonic system.That being said, it is a very enjoyable recording of solid playing from every member of the band."
3,pretty good,"When I first played this I was reminded more of VSOP from the 70s than straight 60s Miles (there is an obvious chain there). Try VSOP ""The Quintet."""
3,The last one worked great...,"This is the second retractable RCA to 3.5mm cord that I've bought. After the first one broke (the right audio channel stopped working after 6 months of gentle use), I decided to get another one. The nice thing is that the cord is 6' long, but once I pulled it past 3', the retractor would not lock in place and shot back to 2'. Also, most RCA jacks go YELLOW (video), WHITE (left audio), and RED (right audio). For some reason, this unit is inverted, so the white and red jacks have to cross over eachother in order to plug into the unit. On a retractable cord, this causes unnecessary tension on the cord and will cause it to fail quicker.After a week, I went back to the 3' cord I bought from Radio Shack. It may not be retractable, but after 3+ years of use, it works just like the day I bought it."
3,Interesting new look on Civil War History,It was informative and interesting but some of the writing was rather dry! The author is a knowledgeble historian but not as dynamic a writer.
4,Siva review,"I am a doll collector and do not play with these dolls. They are currently being displayed in my home and they are still inside their boxes. The boxes are not very good quality the cardboard is paper like, and very flimsey. I do not know how durable the acutal toy is. I hope this helps."
5,Bought this one on a hunch,"When visiting Buenos Aires last summer, I fell in love with the city. Coming across this CD I purchased it more for the name than anything else. But, it is fantastic. The music is varied and offers different sounds for different settings. All of the tracks are smooth and crisp. Excellent blend of ambient, groove and funk elements. The music is versatile, not confined, and can be used as background or chill. Open a bottle of Malbec and turn on the CD. Be transformed."
4,Very Clever Entry,"Holmes takes on the case of a young solicitor accused of arson and murder. He enters the case with his work cut out for him, as the circumstantial evidence against the young lawyer is very strong, and the motive an excellent one. Holmes must prove his client innocent in the face of mounting evidence as he matches wits with the stubborn and un-creative Inspector Lestrade. In this installment of Holmes mysteries, the late, lamented Jeremy Brett shows the melancholy side of Holmes as the case turns against him. Colin Jeavons is excellent as Lestrade, but the character of MacFarland seems much too unconcerned about his fate to be effective; a little more emotion and indignation would have helped a considerable amount. The unravelling of the mystery is both ingenious and funny, as Holmes outwits Scotland Yard, saves his client, and comes face to face with ""a very deep, vindictive, and malicious"" culprit. A worthy effort."
3,"Great Classic Album, but can't stand the test of Time","First off let me say that I think Cherrelle has always been seriously under rated as an artist, Whitney came on the scene stole her thunder and Janet put out ""Control"" which literally took ""Control"" of the music world. ""High Priority"" had funky, fun songs but, is caught in a time warp. Any other song that is played off this album other than ""Saturday Love"" on current radio would get listeners under thirty scratching their heads in confusion. ""You Look Good To Me"", ""Artificial Heart"" and ""Oh No It's You Again"" are fun songs with great lyrics, but very 80's. Cherrelle's follow -up album is a masterpiece and very consistent but also caught in a time warp (Many of the songs sound sooo dated..). Overall though I recommend if you love 80's music you will love all of Cherrelle's album's so please go out and support her and all other real artist. Just had to be truthful about this album as a LOVER of music."
4,Maureen's High Priority review,"25 Best: R&B; Classics (Spkg)Real 80's R&B;I first bought this music by Cherrelle in the form of a cassette back in 1985. It sounds as fresh and as current as it did back in the day. This CD reminded me of the creativity of the music that was in the 60's 70's and 80's. It made me sad that all the talent and creativity seems to have disappeared from today's R&B.; Even, the so called ""good"" artistists of today do not hold a candle those singers and song writers of yester year. Oh, how I miss those glory years. This is a great C&D;, one that every true lover of R&B; would surely enjoy."
2,Does anyone actually read this?,"Did any of you people actually read this? OK, I'm probably the only guy in the world that spends many an evening reading old site reports on eastern North American archaeology, and the original Squire and Davis has been on my wish list since I was a kid. Well the Smithsonian reprint reviewed here has a problem that is unforgivable...one of the plates is missing and another has been printed twice in place of the missing one."
1,Horrible!,"I am african-american and I have extremely poofy wavy thick hair. It is fine when wet, but when it dries, it looks worse than a full bred chow-chow dog. I thought this stuff would help with poofiness as my hair dries, but I was let down. It did nothing that a cheap can of moose can't do.I washed my hair and used their conditioner as well. I towel dried my hair a little and then applied the cream. It left my hair somewhat hard and as soon as I ran my fingers through my hair, it poofed - as usual. So, save your money. This product is not special at all."
3,nice but not as the blue dial one,"I got one with light blue mother-of-pearl dial years ago for my sister. Vice pretty and decent. I loved it. She loves it, and so does one of her co-workers. The co-worker asked me to get the same one for her - they are both in China. I did not find exactly the same one even on [...], guess the model is discontinued (why?). This pink-dialed one was a substitute. Looks nice also, but the pink color is a little off --- does not bring out the natural opal glow of mother-of-pearl, but kind of too shinny and too pinky. Otherwise I think it excellent."
2,"New Christine, Old Christine: The Complete Third Season","The New Adventures of Old Christine's Season 3 deserves 5-stars, but I gave it two because of so few episodes.Two DVD's, 10 episodes. Regular price, 34.99, on sale 24.99.What I'd like to know is the actual cost in the making of a DVD.Season 3's episodes are well-written, well-acted and hilarious.I love Julia-Louis Dreyfus. She's one of the funniest comedians of the 21st century. A newer version of Lucille Ball.The remaining cast members are excellent actors, too.Each character does a fantastic job, well-suited to their roles, in a family-type atmosphere.I recommend buying Season 3 especially if you're a die-hard Julia/Elaine/Christine fan..Prepare youself to watch the complete season at one sitting. Buy a smaller bag of popcorn. lol. Toni"
1,New Adventures of Old Christine season 3 DVD,"I never have written a review before but I was having trouble opening the window for customer feedback. Was disapointed that this DVD was purchased from Amazon and it is a bootleg copy. The originals were copied onto an inferior disk therefore it clicked the whole time it was played. Was suspicious when I first opened it that it was not the same packaging from Season 1 and Season 2 that I have. The disk was even a pinkish color not like the siver ones of regular DVD's. It did not say original in the discription when I went back and checked but I thought Amazon only sold original copies. Shame on you Amazon! Buyer beware. The only good thing about this is that Amazon does have a great return policy. The bad thing is, I have to reorder with someone else and wait for my new copy."
1,New adventures of old Christine,This was my third attempt at purchasing this season from amazon and all were defective. Seasons one and two were great but season three must have some manufactures defect. Great show wish I could get third season
4,NPG,"Fabulous music by Prince!!!!!This Album is one of Princes better ones, I love all of the songs on here! My favourite song is diamonds and pearls but there are others that I like just as much."
3,My least favorite Prince cd,"This is the lowest rating I'd give any Prince cd - 3 stars. The good songs one here are really good....Cream, Gett Off and Insatiable. But, the bad songs on here are really bad...Jughead, Live 4 Love and Push are probably the worst tracks Prince has ever recorded. All three of those songs are poor attempts by him to rap and be hip and all that stuff. He should just stick with making good music as he has for most of his career."
5,"Like a diamond or a pearl, PRICELESS","From the moment the curtain parts and we hear the sound of ""Thunder"", he gives us our fix of funk with ""Daddy Pop"", ""Cream"", ""Push"" and (my personal favorite) ""Gett Off"", along with the smooth vibes of ""Insatiable"" and the title track, the joyful sounds of ""Willing and Able"", and the NPG's Jam of the Year ""Jughead"". A must for Prince fans, and even if u're not, u'll definitely dig it!"
4,Pick the diamonds from the swamp,"This was probably one of Prince's most commercial efforts back in the day, and I can only think that the full inclusion of the NPG was the source of his musical flourishes here. The band sounds incredibly fresh, especially drummer Michael Bland.It's a singles-driven album (""Cream"", ""Gett Off"", ""Diamonds And Pearls"", ""Money Don't Matter 2Nite""), and the filler is some of his worst ever (""Jughead"", ""Thunder"", ""Live 4 Love""), but when the singles are as excellent as they are here, it's no problem.On par with his follow-up, the ""Symbol"" album. The two are equally good."
5,I love this download,Prince has always been one of my favorite artists and Diamonds and Pearls is probably my favorite album. I love the music in general. The 90's rap is a little cheesy because its outdated but I love the vocals and the messages of love.
4,Not Bad!,"""Diamonds and Pearls"" is no classic like ""Sign O the Times,"" but it's full of the rump-shaking funk we've come to expect from him. His then-new band was called the New Power Generation, and they team up to deliver solid grooves from start to finish. ""Thunder"" is a great opener and an impressive melange of inspirational rock and soul, while ""Daddy Pop"" is a James Brown-flavored jam that also passes along nicely. Yep, there are also the singles: the infectious ""Gett Off,"" the mellowed-out ""Money Don't Matter 2Night"" and the guitar-peppered ""Cream,"" which blasted straight to No. 1. But the strongest cuts are the ones that didn't get released as singles, such as ""Willing and Able."" The sole straight-up dud is ""Jughead,"" a disastrous attempt at rap. But otherwise, Prince and NPG hold their own impressively on ""Diamonds and Pearls."""
4,The begining of the end for Prince,"After Batman (a big success) and Graffitti Bridge. Prince wanted to connect with the Black audience and in doing so he gave up the fiery Rock side that made his music so amazing--to the level of genius (with Stevie Wonder,Jimi Hendrix and David Bowie). Musicians that took the genre of music they were in and took it another level. Bigger than the musical worlds they lived in. Like George Michael who gave up on sex after Faith with Living without Prejudice vol 1. Prince gave up on Rock in Diamonds and Pearls and in doing so they lost something. With Prince this R&B album is actually very good and the following (Symbol) album is good but The ""Most Beautiful girl in the world"" single would be the end of the hits. The albums that came later on ,still have R&B sound it's just that they are not good. Prince like George Michael lost something when they turned their backs on what made them want to be Stars in the first place."
5,fantastic,"this album is a must buy for prince fans, my favorite song on it is insaitable because he shows the romantic and explict side of him. A true work of art!!"
4,Diamond is the Rough,"This is the only Prince album I will review, because I feel this is his best, this album was so full of hits that the hits just kept coming off of this album. The song that got it going was ""Gett Off"" a very sexually charged song, but very well written song, but not lyrically challenged this song got him to #21, then came ""Cream"" another hit actually a #1 hit also had a good video, and became one of Prince's biggest hit, then came the beautifully crafted title song ""Diamonds & Pearls"" a song that took him right back to the top 5 hitting #3, then two songs for different charts, ""Insatiable"" which was a #9 R & B hit, and the world conscience ""Money Don't Matter 2 Night"" once again showing the nicer side of Prince, but there are other gems here like, ""Live 4 Love"" and ""Willing And Able"", this album shows that back then Prince was riding high, now it seem like he fell off the face of the earth, hopefully he can make a comeback."
5,How is it even possible to give Prince a low rating?,"Even at his worst, he's a master! And his musicians are the best. Of course, being that he is a local boy, I might be biased. But whether or not you like Prince's music, you have to be impressed with his ability to remain on the top, and at the cutting edge of music. In fact, he is IN FRONT of the cutting edge! Him music has always been futuristic, and everything that follows takes his lead. He is a master of the media of music.This album contains some of my favorite classic Prince songs, and I can listen to it over and over."
3,Mixed Emotions,"I think this album has got really good songs ( Thunder, Diamonds 'n Pearls, Cream, Money Don't Matter 2 Night, Push ) and really bad ( Walk, Don't Walk, Jughead, Insatiable, Gett Off ), so I just really don't know where to it ... The goods are really good, the bads are quite week, that's how this album first made me an impression ... For a better one, check out their next album, titled O)+> Comparing 2 that one, and 2 the other albums made with NPG ( except Newpower Soul ) I cannot give this album a better mark then a 3. But of course, this doesn't mean that I don't like this CD ... It's a good album for those too, who were not Prince-fans before, because it's very wide styles changing on it, and the melodies that people can remind easily makes it a very popular one in all meanings."
2,very average,aside from get off and money don't matter 2 night this is a very run of the mill album.to much appealing to and very little substance.
2,Overkill,"Too many notes, too much whinning , and the intro to ""Diamonds and Pearls"" is very weak and very boring...I expected more from a talent such as Prince"
3,A 3D fighter from another era,"Bloody Roar II: The New Breed - Circa 1999GOOD:- Nicely Balanced old school PS1 3D fighter- Beast change really brings something new and unique to the tableBAD:- Graphics are dated, for today's generation- Somewhat small staple of fightersIF IT FITS YOUR TASTE:- Playing a Tekken/Virtual Fighter rip off where the fighters can transform into animals- Has some old school ""dial-in-combos""GAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO:- Virtual Fighter 3- Tekken 3- Soul BladeADDITIONAL NOTES:- Bloody Roar II has almost every thing from Bloody Roar (the original) except for three fighters, besides that Bloody Roar II has everything the original had and then some- Later Bloody Roars such as Bloody Roar 3 and 4, where not as Balanced as this one but the graphics were better"
5,can't believe nobody's mentioned the puke animation,"if you're in beast mode, and you hit your opponent perfectly in the stomach, you'll make your opponent puke.me and my brother used to keep score the number of times you could make the other pukewe named this game ""puke""it was awesome"
4,"Decent Set, Nothing More","The first two discs of this set are really good, with much material that I had never seen before. The problem comes with disc three. The narrator (Bono of U2) will not be quiet, and frequently disrupts the music. To make matters worse, many of the performances on disc three are repeats. Surely they must have tons of footage they've yet to show. This is a good set, and one that I'd reccommend despite of the flaws. They includde songs from Elvis' movies, lip-synch performances, TV appearances, and home movies. What more could you want?"
1,The Nightmarishly Unforgettable Performances,"All Elvis fans have had the following nightmare: They buy an attractively packaged Elvis video product with no less a name than ""Elvis: The Great Performances,"" unwrap the product in a blind fury arising from the anticipation of witnessing what Heaven must surely look like, and find . . . gasp . . . heart attack . . . a made-for-late-night-T.V.-edited montage of movie clips featuring Elvis lip synching his songs while his hair does that weird swaying thing that it does whenever he lip synchs his songs in his movies.We have all had the nightmare, but I had to live it when I bought this set. All Elvis fans with even the most basic senses of music and film appreciation, be advised that this video is nightmarishly bad."
3,Elvis- The Great Performances- Three Disc Set,"Each disc keeps repeating what has already been shown on the other disc. I was disappointed because of this. One disc shouldhave been devoted to his rise in stardom and the other two shouldhave featured performances of Elvis doing what he did best""Entertaining""."
2,I should have listened!,"I should have listened to the Amazon.com reviews. Many of them said it looked like the same footage on each disc just from a different angle or a different song from the same concert. I didn't want to believe it but its true. However, I would recommend that you buy disc 1 and not the set. It is the best and captures every side of Elvis you will see in the other two. The version of ""Unchained Melody"" was fascinating. Not only was it very emotional and definitely touched me, but also shocking how heavy he was and was filmed just two months before his death. It may sound crazy but for me it was like a farewell song."
3,Elvis-The Great Performances,"I enjoy this set very much. It is a must for Elvis fans. It is a nice gift box for a collector. It is more of the earlier years, and shows how much he matured in both his voice and performance. He is my favorite artist ever and anyone will enjoy this set......"
1,A Vague Sneak Peak About the King,"As a relatively new Elvis fan, I generally speaking liked this selection. There are a lot of performances from Elvis's younger year that I very much enjoyed. The thing that bothered me though, was that the narration was very chopped up.I liked first two discs well enough. The narrator was much more informative and interesting to listen to. However, I was very surprised, and disappointed when they totally switched to someone else on the third disc.I felt that wa highly unorganized and strange. White the first two discs have fun performances and even some home movies.The third I believe was just thrown together and made to make extra money. I personally would get something else for Elvis' performances. However, I'm not so disappointed because like I said I am a new Elvis fan. So I believe it's good for people who want a good introduction to him, but not for long time Presely fans though."
2,Come on guys.,"I mean I like this song (enough to buy the single), but let's alter it a little if we're going to call it a different remix. With a song being played 6 times or so, you want it to be altered more than they did. There is one other song on there, but I really didn't care for it. If you want to get your hands on 'Give it Away', tape it off someone else's cd."
1,This CD is soooooooo stupid!,"Face it. 6 bucks for one song? Uhhh..... NO! This is not worth the price. If you want something thats cheap and quality, try Blink 182."
4,A very good read!,"Well I hate long reviews so here's what I have to say about The Lazarus Effect. If you read any of Peter F. Hamiltons books like The Reality Dysfunction then you should enjoy this one. It's Biotechnology vs. Technology, Mermen vs. Mutes"
3,"Great price, but wasn't really funny",this was one of the worst of the roast franchise. I cannot readily think of any roast that was worse than this one. other than when jamie foxx started getting on another no name comedians case it wasn't too funny.
3,Not Great.,"Merle Haggard is the best country music artist ever, but this album is one of his worst. There are a few good listens. The title track is good, but there is too overprocessed. If you are a big Haggard fan, then it is worth trying to find this, but beware this is among the rarest of the rarest to find on CD of Haggard, so you will pay a lot for it.If you are a casual Haggard fan, don't bother with it, because this is not a great album. The cover of the CD makes you think that Haggard was at a bad time in his life, which he was as he was in the middle of his years of heavy drinking, drug use, among other problems. This release certainly shows that sometimes even the best of the best can release a stinker."
5,The most influential album of the last 25 years,"I guess that sounds like a big statement but in my reality it is not too far from the truth.Talking Heads enter the 80's with Fear of Music, arguably the most droll and cliched decade of rock.Although there are plenty of shining lights of the 80's few can stake claim to have recorded an album that defined the era without having a dated sound which ties them to that time.The sequence and flow of an album was never bettered by Talking Heads, and Eno's production while omnipresent is never overbearing.Fear of Music IMHO is the most influential album of the last 25 years.The effects are still manifesting themselves in current bands like Franz Ferdinand and Interpol.Along with Joy Division and Wire, Talking Heads are really the beginning of the intellectualising of post punk, the ramifications which thankfully are still being felt today."
2,Wish I Could Listen to It,"Wow, this disc is full of extras, particularly the DVD side. Too bad the DVD side completely locks up my DVD player. To the point that the buttons on the front don't even work, from trying to open the unit to pushing the button to turn it off. Same thing with the Talking Heads 77 DVD. I'm hearing the same from others who bought it, so you might want to wait until they're offering a better batch."
5,Paranoid weirdness,"Easily the band's strangest album, this is devoted to songs about topics that Mr. Byrne is in fear of. Things like ""Animals"", war, ""Drugs"", as well as other things. While the paranoia may be a bit too much for some and the production too dense for others, it still results in one of the bands greatest albums. ""Air"" and ""Heaven"" are two of the group's finest pop tunes, ""Life During Wartime"" a great single, and ""Animals"" is hilarious. At the same time, though, you are truly afraid."
3,Face fear for few fillers,"You can see the artsy elemental alignments of punk, funk, rock, and freak beginning to take root, if not hear them coming together seamlessly just yet."
4,"Talking Heads ""REVOLVER""","This is to Talking Heads what REVOLVER was to the Beatles; the key transition album, without it you wouldn't know how they got from the one before it (Rubber Soul/Buildings & Food) to the one after (Sgt. Pepper/Remain in Light). And as with REVOLVER, it's full of amazing songs. My personal favorite is Cities, but you could easily pick Mind, Air, Cheese or Drugs (quiz: which title doesn't fit?)"
2,What is this?,"I know that David Byrne said something like, 'The better a singer's voice is, the harder it is to believe what he's saying.' To some extent I agree, but 'Fear of Music' (and a lot of Talking Heads' earlier catalogue, to me) is just unlistenable. His voice is twitching all over the place; it's irritating. That, and the music and lyrics aren't that strong; there's no substance in a song like 'Mind.' I find it hard to believe that they followed this alubm with the incredible 'Remain in Light;' it's like listening to two different bands. I know that they were capable of better - just compare this 'Life During Wartime' and 'Heaven' with the live versions on Stop Making Sense, and you'll see what I mean.That song 'Animals' is funny, though."
1,I'm very affraid.,"Talking Heads, huh? Wow, does the music industry have eyes for talent.Fear of Music is right. This is anything but music, it's crap.I await your harsh ratings."
4,Dog loves it,My Dog loves these toys. She can finaly catch that mean ol' trash man! These seem to last forever if you have one small dog. When I had two Bostons they would fight over it and eventualy tear it up. Took a while though.
2,Pretty Bad,"There's no real content here. This is not Kraftwerk, this is not Bill Laswell at any kind of peak, this is not Herbie Hancock at any kind of peak. It's a group of people at a creative dead end pumping out ""product"". The music is washed-out minimalist R&B."
3,Pretty Good,It's A Pretty Good Disc not Herbie's Best or One of His Best.Vibe Alive With SugarFoot is still Slamming.Herbie was Going For The 80's Electric Groove A Little Too Much.He is a Musical Genius but His Best Grooves were In The 70's.HIM&His Band were Super Funky.Beat Wise is Very George Clinton Influenced.Too Many Drum Machines&Sounds Water this Album down.it has some Moments.
1,painful... Axel F on a bad day....,"I like all of Herbie's stuff from the 60s and 70s. I picked this one up on a whim, curious to hear what it sounded like, expecting it to be something of a mixed bag but hoping there'd be at least one or two pleasant surprises. It's godawful. Painfully cheesy 80s synthesizer (like a bad flashback to the Beverly Hills Cop soundtrack), together with a bunch of very tired sounding electric drumbeats, bad lyrics, weak scratching. I suppose this album has some value to a musicologist, as a historical document, and so on. But as something to listen to, ugh, to my ears the cheese factor is just way, way too much. I think it's great that Herbie has experimented with lots of different styles. But this album is an ugly mess better left collecting dust."
3,BEAUTIFUL FOR MEN OR WOMEN,I bought 2 sets of these for a blouse. They are beautiful. My husband borrows them now and then for his french cuffs too.
4,Another Classic like other Christmas Classics,"This is a Great CD, and also, Dave Williamson and The Regency Singers and Orchestra are now Classics like Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, Nat King Cole, Dean Martin, Gene Autry, Burl Ives, Mannheim Steamroller, Mormon Tabernacle Choir, Elvis Presley, and more recommendations. And they should be on Film and Television, but some people don't know this music, same with Mannheim Steamroller. Awesome Music, Cool."
1,Fighting Westerner not worth buying,"Imagine my disappointment when ""Fighting Westerner"" (my hero Randolph Scott) arrived, dubbed by Front Row Entertainment Video of New Jersey who should be ashamed of the product they produced. I would keep away from anything this company does. My video was incredibly scratched and grainy and impossible to adjust let alone watch! This is the second time I have been caught out by this company. Wouldn't it be nice if Amazon Com could print the name of the company on the films web page so that the buyer has all the information! If I could have rated this product by Front Row Entertainment I would have given its true value at minus 5000! Perhaps Amazon Com should develop a blacklist of poor video/DVD suppliers."
3,A chance to see a legend or two,"This terribly corny movie was dated when made, yet it holds some amazing treats. For devotees of the turn of the century American theater, it has a performance with sound by the legendary and scandalous Mrs.Leslie Carter,later made immortal on film in ""the Lady with Red Hair"", starring Miriam Hopkins. Mrs Carter tried to out Bernhardt Bernhardt, and this film, made the year before her death, reveals her to have kept her dramatic and seductive qualities even at the very sunset of her life. Randolph Scott(of the iron jaw) and a very young Ann Sheridan can also be admired in this very early film from the start of their careers. But it is worth the purchase price just to see Mrs.Carter.The legends about her are fully confirmed here."
2,Less Than Expected,This is a cursory review of the available and relevant literature. I expected much better from the author.
2,Disappointing Divas,"Okay so many of the important women pop singers are represented but they aren't singing their best songs and it's a stretch to call some of these singers Ultimate anything. If you want ultimate, look for indivdual albums or the ultimate Diva record:Lena Horne, Billy Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald and Sarah Vaughn, that's cooking."
1,A biased view of a troubled time with 20/20 hindsight.,"I would have followed the intended emotional path had I not also done some research of other sources. Americans are quick to punish themselves now days without really getting the facts.I suggest reading ""Dishonoring America"" by Lilian Baker,or make an internet visit to the San Franciso Museum website for actual, unaltered information."
5,Second Half of Life,"Toward Holy Ground, Margaret GuentherI selected this book from reviews on Amazon's site for a class I was leading on Aging. Ms Guenther speaks from her pastoral ministry with older persons, providng many insights in forming relationships wtih a variety of needs with those she met. The sub-title says spiritual direction..., sometimes we think that is beyond the ordinary person or friend to the elderly. The writer removes this hesitation as first of all be-friending another, and in this case, be-friending the person(s) of years.I recommend this book because it is easy to read and inspires all of us to be attentive to the older person."
3,Adventure tracks with an 80s twist,"Goonies sounds a bit like a classic adventure/pirate soundtrack, but with a 1980s twist. It has its moments in the movie itself, but this CD doesn't capture it. In fact, it's quite forgettable. I'd only recommend this for hardcore fans of the movie."
3,Apparently not my cup of tea,"As a college classmate of Stephen Marion, I was delighted to see his first novel and immediately bought a copy. Unfortunately, as I began reading, I was not that impressed. It isn't that Stephen Marion isn't a gifted author. It's just that I found the plot draggy, the points of view shifted way too much and at times, I found myself backtracking to see just what was going on. Perhaps I was expecting to see more of our hometown in the book, but I didn't. At any rate, I enjoyed works he did in college much better!"
1,Very disappointing,"I ordered this outfit from another seller but thought it would be worth posting a warning here too... The costume is absolute rubbish, all seams on it tore immediately, the material just does not hold the stitches, my child had to change outfits during halloween :-("
2,What's all the fuss about?,"Whiney, wimpy, nerdy, pop songs. Big deal. We hear this every day. Matchbox 21 or whatever their name is sounds like this, and they suck! Like the one guy wrote, it's Bryan Adams limey style. A few good songs, but no big deal. Have you people never listened to Miles Davis and Gil Evans? Mozart? Johnny Cash? Richard Thompson? Van Morrison? Joni Mitchell? Nina Simone? This word ""genius"" sure comes easy these days. It used to take Joyce, Melville, Nobel, C.V. Raman. Now we have Adam Sandler and Paddy Mcaloon. They don't have to rock out, but this record just has no balls. Geez!"
4,Like nothing else,"'Love Breaks Down' sounded like nothing else on the radio when it landed here in the mid-80's. I bought 'Two Wheels Good' on cassette then and listened to it dozens, maybe hundreds, of times, on my Walkman, as I studied in college. I am happy to bave it again. I don't know what it sounds like to younger ears, but I'm glad to listen again."
5,pure poison flowing through your veins.,"geez. 18 years and the magic is still there. I am a late 30's full grown-up man, i've been around the block but tonight, listening to this CD, and especially "" when loves breaks down "" i feel again the pain of the 18 year old I was when that song came out. Paddy Mc Aloon wrote the Ultimate break-up song. It's pure poison flowing through yours veins.Wendy Smith has an amazing voice and Paddy's lyrics are describing so well what we all have been going through at 1 point of our life.""When love breaks downThe lies we tell,They only serve to fool ourselves,When love breaks downThe things you doTo stop the truth from hurting you ""DAMN !definitively the best song in one of the best albums of the eighties.P.S. : Sylvie, If by, I don't know what miracle, you happened to read this. "" Je t'aime encore et t'aimerais toujours """
5,What are you - 21?,I was when I first heard this and am SO glad to find it still in print! Simply wonderful writing delivered perfectly. On the A-list of things my wife will also listen to...
5,Wow!!,"I sure do hope that Cleiton finally got his copy of this book! He will love it when he does.1000 puzzles of all types. Solutions to most if not all of the puzzles. As far as I can tell there are solutions to all.All different types of puzzles and instructions for making your own! Wonderful!If you want to make your own, you will have to have some ability at interpreting general fabrication instructions and have some shop skills.Fascinating book!!!"
4,Kids love this book!,"As a teacher of very bright children, it is always a challenge to find literature that is appealing without being too serious. This book is lighthearted and humorous, but can be interpreted at many levels. Though some have criticized the parental characters as a bit too laid back and unbelievable, I have interacted with many parents who are even more laid back. The urban setting lends itself to many discussions, especially in suburban or rural areas. My children have enjoyed the creativity in this story and have been able to grow in their own creativity because of it."
3,An Ok book for kids,As a teacher I read this book to see how approriate it was for my students. The discriptions were good. The boy (Maurice) was very creative in his ways. However I thought the adults in the book were protrayed to be dumb. The adults couldn't figure out that Maurice didn't like the dog. I also thought that the plot line was very slow. I am not sure what the parents where waiting for when they didn't move to the country in the beginning of the book. Then once they moved to the country Maurice continued to collect JUNK. What was the purpose of moving. The book is cute. Kids who collect junk may like it. There are lots of words on the pages but the vocabulary isnt very hard.
2,Maurice's Room Book Review,"I didn't like Maurice's Room because the book had absolutely no excitement. The descriptions were very good but the story had no meaning to it. The book was very boring. I had to force myself to read this book because it was so boring. I could see that there was no point in reading a story without excitement, adventure and without any point. Maurice's Room had no problem or solution, which made it very boring, but everything was pretty good.I DO NOT recommend Maurice's Room to anybody. I'd rate this book from one to five, five being the best, a two and a half."
3,"Good, but not great R&P (Rhythm & Praise)","For a group that has been around as long as they have I expected much tighter song production, and although I still haven't heard their first album, I don't know if it would be any better than this one. However, it's not all bad. Songs like ""Greatest Gift"", and ""Conquerors"", are one of the few that make my cut for R&P excellence, but my favorite has to be ""All Over Again"". I love the way that song is produced, start to finish. After those three songs the pickings are kind of slim. The songs aren't terrible, but compared to groups like Men Of Standard, or Commissioned, Choir Boyz are just ok. But the important thing is, they are giving Yahweh God the praise and living their lives as saved Christian brothers and in the end, thats all that matters. I will continue to support them."
2,Way disappointed!,"Someone above said ""Where's Sox & Martin, Gas Ronda, Bill Jenkins, Gene Snow's ""Rambunctious"" funny car - the first to go over 200mph, the Little Red Wagon, the list goes on. It's a neat book, but it falls short - way short. Do yourself a favor; buy it used in the best condition available at the cheapest price."" I agree wholeheartedly and must add - where's Ed Miller and his Hemi duster that won the 1967 WORLD championship in Super Stock Eliminator?? 1967 is covered in the book but this was a GLARING oversight!"
3,Was a little disappointed,"I knew before purchasing this book that it was only 96 pages in length. I also knew it would be impossible to list the vast array of vintage & historic drag racers. However, this book could have been (and should have been) at least double, if not triple, in length. Yes, the pictures are great - they should be, as almost all of these race cars & dragsters are museum pieces restored to maximum professional standards. But more importantly, there were way too many drag racers that were left out that have more historical value than what's represented here. Where's Sox & Martin, Gas Ronda, Bill Jenkins, Gene Snow's ""Rambunctious"" funny car - the first to go over 200mph, the Little Red Wagon, the list goes on. It's a neat book, but it falls short - way short. Do yourself a favor; buy it used in the best condition available at the cheapest price."
3,it works,first off this IS NOT 18 gauge its more like 22 and its PURPLE but it works so im not complaining.
3,Received different item than ordered,"The wire I received was 50' of 18 gauge speaker wire. However, it was purple, not clear/silver/gold as pictured. Not exactly what I was looking for, but at least it was cheap."
2,Not the best there is!,"These balls are not usatt approved, and after playing with these balls I can tell you the 3-star rating is a gimmick. These balls should honestly be rated 1-star. I will give my reasons. First of all, I am a 1700 usatt rated member, and I have played with many balls such as joola, butterfly, nittaku, gambler, dhs, double fish, newgy, etc.The hardness of the balls are surprisingly soft. Many 2-star balls are much harder, such as gambler gold, butterfly 2-star, and newgy 2-star. So it feels really light when you're hitting and looping.The roundness and durability are good, but it doesn't really matter, because club level players won't use these. These balls are meant for garage players, or for robot and multi ball training.The price of these balls are okay at 24 cents a ball. But, Gambler 2-star balls sell for 20 cents a ball.Overall, not bad for the robot, multi-ball, and beginners. But these don't even come close to DHS 3-star or double fish 3-star!"
2,BEWARE: Not Approved For Tournaments,"This ball is not approved for tournament play by either USATT (National Governing Body for Table Tennis in the US) or by ITTF (the International Governing Body for the sport). Beware of their claims of 3-star quality. This designation is reserved for balls that have undergone testing by the ITTF or USATT to assure quality for sanctioned tournaments. This ball has not gone through such testing. Convention in table tennis is that only balls that have passed such tests be advertised as 3-stars. These are cheap Chinese balls being marketed to unsuspecting (unknowledgeable) Americans who have no idea how TT balls are rated or approved. Since they have not gone through the quality tests, they can mark the balls any way they want and are obviously trying to make their ball look better than it is by marking them 3-stars."
1,If you like dirty balls then go ahead and by these,These balls are not good at all in my opinion. They cling to dust and dirt like its there job. After playing with these balls for a little bit my rubbers looks like I dragged them in the dirt. I even washed the balls but this did not help at all. I wish I could return them but will probably just toss them out. I could not get through one game without needing or wanting to clean my rubbers. These balls to me are just dirt delivery systems and if you have any sort of quality rubber don't use them.
5,Great balls!,These ping pong balls don't break easily. I had a July 4th party this year and I thought I would go through many balls during the party but they didn't break even one! Shocking
3,GoGo 3 star tt balls,Balls came ontime and were as represented. Price could be lower for these but overall it is acceptable value. They seem to be durable and well built. Good for practice.
5,I don't know how you could rate this less than 5 stars,"A great product for a great price. That's it ... that could be the end of the review.To further explain my rating I'll go on a bit. The ping pong balls are very good quality. I purchased this case for my firehouse as we're all avid ping pong players. These aren't training balls, they're not crap balls - they're great, game quality balls. They last reasonably long before cracking and have EXCELLENT bounce. The fact that there are 144 of them makes this purchase GREAT because we are ALWAYS losing the balls under our trucks, accidentally stomping on them during heated vollies or just cracking them over time.I wouldn't think to purchase anything else - GREAT ping pong balls. 5 stars throughout."
4,Good product,"The product is good. I've played the balls, good quality comparable with other brand 3 star pingpong balls. The only problem I have is that I did not receive the balls after my order for more than 2 weeks, even with quite expensive ship+handling fee. I have emailed them a few times, no meaningful reponse. Until I called and a girl called Christina was able to quickly follow up and sent it through express. Otherwise it could be a bad shopping experience."
2,"Ok, but the balls still still break.","The GoGo balls are ok, but they still break if hit really hard. The only thing I'm glad about was the good price on 144 balls. If ANY ping pong ball will break when hit by a ping pong fanatic, it helps to have box of 144 extra balls."
3,Good but NOT 3-star quality,"For the price these balls are excellent to hit around. However, they have poor bounce and crack easily compared to ITTF approved 3-stars (which usually costs 5 times more). Serious players should look elsewhere. Not that this is a bad product. but the 3-star rating is misleading."
5,Can't beat this price for these 3 star balls....,"So far I had used only 1 or 2 stars balls due to high prices of 3 star balls at local stores. My kids play lot better now so I decided to go for 3 star balls. Amazon is amazing as usual, I purchased GoGo 3 star white balls and they are perfect for home ping pong games. While product itself is great, delivery was 3 days over the commited range!"
5,the latin bomb!!!,i love this cd....what a tight band !!!..every song is a killer.this will be in my cd player for awhile.i blast it on my way home every chance i get.i wish God would have killed someone else and left Tito Puente alone.
5,It's Pop...,"Let's call it what it is... Pop. And it's fun and great. The CD has some high quality performers. My young daughter loves it, I love it. As much as I don't like the Bratz dolls, the movie was fun with a good message and the soundtrack is great."
2,Difficult and confusing,"I'm a beginner. I am not very flexible. I found this video very difficult. Even if I could wind myself up like her pretzel of an assistant, I wouldn't know what to do for each pose. Her spoken instructions are haphazzard. Often she provides key information about the pose after it is nearly complete. The format is done in three sets of exercises each done twice. It would be better if each pose were held longer, rather than repeated.The video as a whole is too long for daily use. I find myself returning to a couple of Rodney Yee and Tamilee videos instead of this one."
5,wonderful yoga DVD,I am completely new to Yoga. This is a wonderful tape for beginner!! My husband and I practice the yoga together every night with this DVD and we both see the difference. Now we are moving to more advance one!
1,Definitely not Linda's best,"I have had this DVD for some time, now I know why I rarely use it. She often moves into a pose without giving you the instruction. Once in the pose, she willtell you some of the movement. The friend is usually in the ""extended"" version ofthe pose, which is different. She explains her movement. If you are a beginner -you do not need the extended version yet. Linda usually has great DVDs, but inall honesty, I think having the friend there, was distracting to her and did makeher put too much emphasis on the friend. The third area of the DVD is more likea warm up - and probably should have been the very beginning part of the DVD to help you warm up for the extended poses. Linda's ""Natural Body Tune Up"" is fantastic, but unfortunately is only available on VHS. Sorry! - this one - justdoes not get it for me. Not enough actual instruction as your moving into each pose and too much emphasis - on extended pose, especially for a beginner."
2,I was expecting more from this great author,"I have to think that this book was a cop-out. The premise, excellent: we die for real when we are forgotten. The novel starts in a very promising way. A recent widower cannot seem to enjoy life anymore. His wife's mother is going through similar grief. While it would have been fascinating to see how these two people struggled through their pain, the author sticks a ""play"" in the middle of the novel to explore her theory of how oblivion equals true death. The space dedicated to that pseudo-play would have been better utilized showing how the two main characters recover (or not) from their grief and how Hart's theory proves to be valid (or not).I still think Josephine Hart is an excellent writer, and recommend Sin as proof. This book did not do it for me."
4,compelling but uneven,the opening and closing chapters of this book were beautiful and chilling. but the large middle section of a play-within-the-book was less satisfying... which i suppose means it worked.
5,One of the BEST books I have ever writtren (and i read alot),"I was first drawn to the cover in my local library. A naked chic tends to do that. I started to read ""Oblivion"" on the way home and literally couldn't put it down. The book is very indepth and inciteful. There is a lot of connectiveness to this book: You can read this and easily relate and sympathize. The characters are wonderfully portrayed in this story of sex, death, relationships and feelings. I have been trying to find this book for a long time and finally did. If you want something great to read and have a laugh and a tear then get this book! ""Happiness is a choice, make it and don't cry!"""
4,"a bit short, but quality is better than quantity","The Secret World of Cults was one of the first books that pulled me into learning about various religious groups. I constantly go back and refer to this book when I am asked a question regarding a specific cult. The book is extremely short. Nevertheless, excellent information can be taken from it's contents and the book is fairly up to date considering Heaven's Gate occured about five years ago. Many color photos adorn the pages giving the reader an opportunity to see cultic symbols as well as the leaders first hand. The book includes a wide range of topics, just to name a few: freemasons, the knights templar, satanism, voodoo etc...One of the best things about this book is that the author gives an unbias interpretation of these groups. It is extremely difficult to trust a writer who gives you the impression that he or she is out to start a crusade, especially when they don't cite credible sources."
1,do not get ripped off this is the same version as the Tai seng,The title pretty much says it all there is not still a remastered version of ninja checkmate AKA The Mystery Of Chessboxing the cover has a better picture than the one in the Martial arts theater Tai Seng version and it is printed by the bootleg company of RED SUN or Bonzai what they call themselves these days it is overall one of the greatest martial arts movies ever though and recomend anyone to watch this film and maybe hope to one day be letterboxed and remastered also a good site to look for kung fu movies is [...]
5,Hey...does anyone know if Meja's coming to the U.S. on tour?,"Hey, Meja...your CD is really pretty good. I was surprised at how much your CD moved me. It was pretty deep. It had depth. I liked it. It made me wanna sing---something that most albums DON'T do. Britney Spears' album did. B*witched's album did. And yours did, too. DAMN!Listen to this album carefully...and maybe you'll like it, too. LISTEN first, though--don't critcize. Give Meja at least one decent chance. I did...and I'm not sorry that I did. I loved it!"
1,do not buy this if you are a native english speaker,"Nevermind the tunes - they're just your average pop ditties; if you like it or not is a matter of taste. But the lyrics are REPUGNANTLY STUPID. Unless you are able to totally shut them out, you'll be racing for the off-button in no time. If you ever thought Aqua might just possibly be funny, Meja doesn't leave room for such excuses. There are lots of choices in the same music genre, you ought to be able to find something that doesn't insult your intelligence to such an extreme."
3,Good for an introduction to the language,"This CD is good for a brief introduction to the language, but it is not really enough for full conversation once you get off of the plane. I listened to this in my car the weeks leading up to my vacation and it was definitely helpful, but unless you have a Disc-man, you probably won't be listening to this on the plane! Worth it for a quick intro, but don't expect to become fluent!"
1,"Only for review, not for learning!","-No basic pronunciation section-there definitely should be one.-The example jumps to lengthy sentences without introduce the single words used in advance.No way the audience can remember the whole pronunciation of the sentence, let along speak it right."
3,Has Its Uses,"The bad news (which really should be obvious anyway) is that there is no conceivable way that this CD could teach you enough French to sound like anything other than an idiot in the time it takes to fly from New York to Paris... or even (to paraphrase another reviewer) from New York to Mars.The good news, though, is that this little CD is not without some usefulness if you forget that ""in-flight"" stuff. I have been using it to back up a solid text on elementary French as a way to check up on my pronunciation and accent, help with training my ear for listening to French, and as general support during car rides, etc. The lessons are quick and painless, easy to navigate through, thus excellent for reviewing while stuck in traffic.Utterly insufficient for service as the backbone of any independent study of conversational French, this could still prove useful as a supplement and an initial filler for the gaps inherent to text books."
1,"Not worth the time, money or frustration","I wish I had read Alex's review before buying this product.I bought this prior to a trip to Franced and was very disappointed in the product. The CD had several weaknesses as a teaching tool: The French speakers on the CD recite words and phrases too fast for beginners. There is never a slow, sounded-out pronunciation of a word which makes it difficult to grasp exactly what it should sound like. Each word is recited only once and then they move on to the next phrase or word. If you missed the word or pronunciation--which is often, you have to reverse and listen again, and again, and again.Save yourself the money, money and most of all frustration and buy a different product."
3,Good refresher!,"This language CD is a good refresher for those that know a little of the language. It is certainly not realistic to absorb this information on the flight. You will need to listen to it for at least a couple weeks before your trip. I would have liked to see them repeat the phrases a couple of times, but it's nice to hear the phrases in the native language."
4,In-Flight French,"I am surprised that more people did not find this CD helpful. No, you will not be fluent in French when you finish, but you will have a decent supply of words and phrases that will come in very handy. I listened to the CD daily on the way to work for months before going to France (I do not catch on quickly), and was quite impressed with what I was able to absorb. I had been in France 3 years prior without any knowledge of the language, and there was a huge difference in knowing a few simple things. The little booklet that came with the CD was valuable as well, it helped a lot when my ear could not pick up the sounds on the CD. I would highly recommend this to anyone who is going on a short trip as a tourist."
1,Spoken too fast,"If you are new to French, this guide is not for you. The French speakers on this cd recite words and phrases -way- too fast for beginners, and they only recite the word once and move on to the next phrase or word. Get to know your rewind button. If you are looking for a very frustrating, poorly conceived and put together guide this is surly it."
2,NOT for beginners,"i couldn't decide between this one or Lonely Planet's audio guide so i ended up getting both. good thing.In-Flight is NOT for beginners, maybe good for those who need to brush up on their French but not for those who need a quick introduction. biggest problem is they say the words/phrases ONCE and FAST. no way to learn that way.the companion book it comes with is handy and i'm actually going to take it with me. but not the CD!"
4,moving beyond partisan politics,It is nice to see that conservatives have purchased this book (if in fact they have) but it's sad that they have missed the point. Move On is about real people from all over who want to see their country moving in the right direction. It is an effort to move away from nasty rush limbaugh politics and toward a positive dialog about issues of concern to all of us. If some people find that effort offensive (and it appears that they do) then we're going to have work to very hard to save America.
5,Practical and inspiring,"Wow, what a great book. I just finished this cover to cover and am inspired to go out there and change the world! I always thought that involving myself in politics was useless and now I understand why people do it...it matters! I don't consider myself political in any way, but some accounts in this book are by people who are not ""political"", but moved to action due to a situation in their life. They are all so moving and the best part is that MoveOn adds tips after each essay which makes for a practical, must-read for any American."
1,This organization should be outlawed,MoveOn is an anti-American orgnanization that should not be given any light. They work against American values and they and the ACLU seek to undermine the very principles that guide this nation and protect it against forces that work against us and our safety and security. It's a shame someone even considered printing this propaganda of lies. It is also a shame Amazon would even consider selling it. Love of country comes by loyalty to its government not by working against it. Welcome to reality. Only the tree huggers of the far left will buy and read this hogwash.
1,moveon.suck,"I read this book and it confirmed my beliefs that moveon.org is nothing more than a group of neo-communist scum. They stand for everything indecent and wrong with the USA. This group ought to be considered, along with the ACLU, a domestic terrorist organization."
1,It's somewhat rare...,"""It's somewhat rare to see an entire grassroots political organization listed as the author of a book""... because most authors have the nerve to put their name on it. It's just a way to spout hate and get away with it."
1,Illegal fundraising for John Kerry,For those in berkeley that prefer to deny or ignore the times that we are facing. A bunch of extremist and intolerant individuals that only recognize those who agree with their liberal-fascism.
1,I couldn't stop laughing!!,"Sure,go out and get 'em! Simple minded book by the simple minds at MOO-VE ON. I really couldn't stop laughing. As for the one star rating-you people owe me two stars since there is no minuscategory."
4,Not Shocking,"In a series of short essays written by ordinary people, this book offers many ideas on how Americans can actively participate in the electoral process. ""50 Ways . . ."" is informative, not shocking, a quick read, and rooted in fact, not emotion. Folks from any political affiliation would learn a lot by reading this book, so I'm glad that the ones who vilify it without even having read it, don't."
5,50 Ways To Transform Injustice,"MoveOn provides pivotal information to transform injustice for the millions of people who have been railroaded and victimized due to laws that need to be changed.What about the tens of thousands of parents who have been railroaded in unwarranted post-dissolution child custody cases, due to lack of funds for proper legal representation?What about the minor children who are used as pawns in child custody cases that are not receiving child counseling to heal their pain, because no such laws are in place.What about the countless children that are placed into a rancid and toxic foster care system where they undergo child molestation, and some even die?This is what MoveOn's book will help people do. Transform injustice, by changing laws."
2,50 ways to compromise you rcountry,"Interesting but disheartening. I should think that reading the great Greek and Roman thinkers and philosphers or perhaps the writings of the founding fathers would be more honest a way to help the country. After all, if you marry your husband and then want to change him substantially, is that really love? I think not. I think rather that we've been had. What is the true intention or agenda?"
1,Embarrasing - a missed opportunity!,Promised so much and what do we have -- a sappy do-goody book; MoveOn were a cutting edge force last year but now they seem more to be a force to channel votes to Kerry...the book is junior high in its sophistication...ALinsky's RUles for radicals is still the book for this kind of thing
1,Leftist Social Conditioning,"Moveon.org, a group of disgruntled (albeit wealthy) socialists, want you to read their book so that you become one of their drooling lemmings. Save your money. Unless you want to torch lots of humvees, romp naked on a maple syrup commune, wed your dog and do whatever ""feels good"" then this book is not for you. Save your money, plant a tree instead."
5,"Wicked riddims fi uno, seen, check it out, best dancehall","Mi haffi biggup dis title, nuff respect to JAMDOWN, keep dis sh*t up. RESPEK"
1,Not very helpful,I tried to use this book as a resource to help me in a songwriting class I was teaching. Some of it was out of date and most was pretty useless. You would have better luck just doing a google search. Did not live up to my hopes or expectations at all.
3,Multimedia skills not up to sexual creativity,"(A) I own most of Ken Stubbs books, (B) Buy the VHS version of this video to save disappointment. I have both, and amazingly, the VHS has better video quality. The DVD does have two complete versions of the sensual dances partially shown in the VHS, but the main feature only has 3 tracks, marking 15, 30, and 45 minutes -- even when these time marks cut the demonstration of a position in two. At minimum, each group of positions should have had its own track. I love the concept, the poetry, the artwork, the scenery in this video -- but Ken, get a multimedia consultant next time."
4,CHARRO,THAN YOU SOO VERY MUCH TO YOU I GOT THIS FOR MY HUSBAND. HE IS THE BIGGEST ELVIS FAN EVER. THIS IS ONE OF THE THREE CD MOVIE HE DID NOT HAVE TO COMPLETE HIS COLLECTION. THIS ITEM CAME VERY QUICKLY AND THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH. WOULD BUY FROM YOU AGAIN.
1,Good Movie BAD QUALITY,"This DVD should never have been released like this. The picture is really bad and the sound, it sounds like a record. Some places seem like the tracking is out of order and others you can't make out the pictures. It looks like the movie was taped off tv in wide screen format than it looks as though someone took a camera and put it in front of the tv screen and did a pan and scan version of it. There are lines (like that of a vcr recording) all the way through the movie.The sound drove me up the wall it was so bad. The reason I say it was recorded off tv is because the beginning and the end are cut and before the end theme is over there's a warner television distribution logo. Maybe I'm wrong but the quality just flat out sucks."
1,Nasty,I'm afraid this movie is one big [bad deal]. Its like someone recorded the film on their portable tv on the cheapest vcr ever made!Its amazing the company had the cheek to put their name on the box- AVOID!!!!
2,The King of Pain,"""Charro!"" (1969) gives Elvis Presley little support in terms of scripting and direction. However, there are a few noteworthy aspects in this dull western. The neck-branding scene is perhaps the most sadistic moment in Elvis cinema - it's rare to see the King endure such excruciating pain. In addition, his character doesn't break into song (a wise decision). An intriguing sequence finds Elvis walking across the Arizona desert with no rear projection or extras in sight. It's one of the few naturalistic moments in a Presley film. Overall, ""Charro!"" is another misguided attempt to duplicate the success of Clint Eastwood's spaghetti westerns."
3,Not that bad !,Not that bad of a movie...Elvis made alot worse. Tht title song is great as sung over the credits !
3,Where is the un-cut Charro?,"This was supposed to be a R-rated movie. What happened to it? Early 1969 when this was released it was ridiculously chopped down to make it a G-rated western. Obviously this was not the vision of director Charles Marquis Warren or Elvis Presley's when he first read the script. Supposedly the 2007 is the restored version,and it is enjoyable at times. Elvis Presley is very good in the action scenes. The indoor sets look cheap, and make the film look very low budget. The opening scene in the bar is terrible. People will say the movie is ok for an Elvis film,but i think we as fans deserve more than that. So i hope when they release this on blu-ray it will be a director's cut."
4,Elvis/ Charro,"Even if it is a knock off of a Clint Eastwood flick I still enjoyed the movie, As a long time fan of Elvis it was good to see him in a film where he didn't sing. I'm like a lot of others if he would have been able to star in a Star Is Born Elvis would still be with us. Anyway I think you will enjoy the movie if you like westerns."
1,A No-Budget King,"The King is a rogue cowboy hunted by his former outlaw buddies in what is one of Elvis' lowest points in a not so celebrated film career. Yes, he doesn't stop what he is doing and burst out singing ""Clambake, Gonna have a clambake"" but that would have been better then this hard to watch western. I know EP was making a million dollars a picture by this time. The budget on this movie excluding his salary had to 10, maybe 20 bucks. It looks horrible. There is just no life in the movie. I know it was suppose to be a drama but come on. I'm an enormous Presley fan, just not so much with his acting movies. I'll blame the Colonel for that, but that's a totally different review for another time and place. Check out Change of Habit co-starring Mary Tyler Moore for a good acting role by the hillbilly cat and Elvis: That's the way it is for the real thing on and off stage."
4,Charro,The DVD arrived in a couple of days. The DVD was in excellent condition. I did not receive a receipt and no instructions as to how to return if defective.
1,Could Have Been So Much Better,"The movie is quite good showing that given the right material, Elvis Presley could have been an outstanding actor. This was a step in the right direction but too late in his acting career. I was hoping this DVD issue would show this movie off in great light. Unfortunately, this was not the case. The company have used an inferior copy and DVD just enhance any problems with the print. I hope in the future we will get a first generation copy for our collections. The rating given refers to the quality of the DVD and not the actual movie which should be 3 stars."
1,Pass the Pills,"No wonder Elvis took ""Prescription Medication"" making dreadful movies like this. It's so awful words cannot describe. It looks cheap, nasty, badly acted, badly directed, badly edited with no story. It's just awful.What on earth was going on in his and the Colonel's heads thinking that fans would put up with watching this crap at the movies when you had the real deal in Clint Eastwood. Even at the time it was made, Westerns were going out of fashion.This was, thank God, one of the last movies he made. I'm a big Elvis Fan but could not bear to watch it twice.The DVD is bad quality, no picture clean up, no extras, nothing. What's the point?"
1,Low Key Western Doesn't Cut It,"Elvis Presley's only movie that wasn't a drama or comedy with songs or a straight Hollywood Musical - the only Elvis song is the well-produced title song heard over the opening credits. As many folks have said, this one was an attempt to get Elvis in the Clint Eastwood mold and do something ""different"". It seems that the original plan to include exciting fight scenes (which Elvis actually excelled at!) and more traditional stuff was deemed politically incorrect at the time, so we have the star basically in a trance while the town he is supposed to protect gets constantly hit by cannon fire from his former friends. The storyline stays in neutral until the welcome ""End"". There are some interesting things from his post-""formula"" era - unfortunately there is not one memorable scene in this film. (The Audience Bewilderment Factor [of 7] supplants the Embarrassment Factor)."
5,Outstanding art & narrative,"For me this is a ""blow me away"" book. Although my first contact with Herb Kane, he feels familiar, comfortable, honest... besides being knowledgeable, creative, insightful. My feeling is that both his illustrations and his ""story"" about Hawaii is right.... it has been written and painted through him, you might say..... but this man is not a new-age flake.... very solid, very real."
1,Nunca recibí el envio!,Hice la compra de la tercer temporada de Damages hace ya algunos meses y vergonzozamente Nunca recibí el envio!No tengo otra manera de reclamarlo!Por favor contactarse urgente!!!
1,No English subtitles for the Hearing Impaired !,"I bought the DVDs based on product information given that Subtitles on the hearing impaired: English was provided; as I am hearing impaired. To my surprise, no ENGLISH SUBTITLES were on the discs and was further disappointed when all the discs I bought - Season 1 , 2 ,3 ( all three purportedly having the ENGLISH SUBTITLES for the hearing impaired, do not have them ! )"
5,Damages Season 3,"Never had a problem with any of the products ordered so far. As for Damages, I already know I'm addicted to it."
1,Very poor series,"I really enjoyed first season of these series, which I thought was really amazing and with a lot of suspense. Second season was not very great. Third season is really not worth watching - very poor actor play, each serie is filled with long-lasting face shots, eyes darting and things like that, which are supposed to mean something, but eventually lead to nothing. Screenplay is also not good, the series are cut in the most strange way - first you get ""now"", then next moment it is ""six months before"" and then afterwards it is ""five months after"". That is the only thing which could hold suspense.Also all these long and fake face shots are repeated constantly, actors really need to do something with their play. Glenn Close is decent, though, but you could not make interesting series on one actress, when whole cast plays outrageously bad. Definitely not worth watching, when there is Breaking Bad around."
4,movie review,The acting and the charater presentation was well done. The film was well directed and offered a realistic story line.
5,Great Series!,"I loved watching 'Damages' on TV, but then they moved it to another satellite company! I was thrilled to find it free on Amazon with my Prime membership. I had a 'Damages' marathon, watching Season 3 and Season 4 - thanks, Amazon!"
1,DAMAGES,I PERSONALLY DO NOT CARE FOR THIS SERIES. I BOUGHT THESE FOR MY SISTER WHO REALLY LIKES THIS SERIES.I'M SURE THAT SHE WOULD GIVE IT 5 STARS!!
3,Why no release date? It's out in Australia,"I have been scanning Amazon for months waiting for the release of the third series. By coincidence I was walking through a retailer in Australia and there it was for $20 (the $A and $US are at parity). A mystery, given Amazon usually leads the way."
3,Weakest Season Yet,"I watched all the shows as they were broadcast. I have been watching since the beginning. This season, despite having fabulous material and actors o work with, was the weakest yet. (That said, it was still pretty good, compared to most of the dreck on TV.)This seems like a transitional season, leading up to next season's conclusion to the stories. I hope they do better next season, they're certainly capable of it! And kudos to Ted Danson for the fabulous job he's doing!"
5,Gripping,Absolutely gripping - can't wait for Series 4.Series 3 kept us on the edge of our seats. The best part was that so many new stories where introduced so we new that there had to be more series. A must watch for those who love legal stories with a devious twist.
5,Another installment of exceptional television!,"Watch year 1 and 2 first....you won't be disappointed! The writing, acting and sets are all exceptional. Definitely quality programming."
5,PROTAZOA IS HOTT!,I LOVE THIS MOVIE FOR ONE REASON AND ONE REASON ONLY! PROTAZOA!! YOU WANNA SEE ONE OF THE HOTTEST GUYS OUT THERE WITH A KILLER VOICE ITS HIM BY FAR. I WISH I WAS ON A SPAY-STAY WITH HIM MAN...WOO!
2,"ghastly, but watch it for greGory smith!","hes only on screen for a few scenes, but they are well worth watching, esp the scene by the swimming pool wherein he shows off his notable assets. fine for fans of poulle, but best to watch this in its weekly showing on cable."
4,GOOD SUPPORT,Good support for sports. I don't wear it everyday. Size seems to run small compared to other bras I have.
5,Great sports bra!!,"I've bought this bra many times over the past four years. Even as my weight has fluctuated, I purchase the appropriate size and it never fails to work like it's supposed to. My sizes have ranged from 36C to 38D to 36DDD and it's done the job like a pro. I like that you don't get a ""uniboob"" look when wearing it, which actually helps lessen the bounce tendency. You're also not suffocating from having too tight a band. The size runs true to the size to what I wear in Victoria's Secret Body by Victoria bras. It also accomodates the wearing of a heart rate monitor strap around the ribs. I highly recommend this bra."
1,Natori bra,I found this bra to be not as supportive as they claim. Still alot of bounce when exercising and the material seem to be to stretchy so the longer it's worn the more it loses shape. The shoulder straps I didn't find had enough support hooks for lift up. I personally wouldn't recommend this bra.
1,Looks can be deceiving,"By the looks of this, it should have been the perfect bra. The only thing I really liked was the fabric...it is nice and soft. The first thing I noticed after putting it on was that I was much too 'pointy' for my taste. I just didn't like the way it shaped me. I wore it around for a day and it was so uncomfortable. I was either being poked or rubbed somewhere, or the bottom band would curl up. I don't understand why it was so uncomfortable, because all hardware is nicely covered by fabric. I really want to like this bra, but I don't think I even want to give anothe try!!"
3,"5 stars for comfort, 2 stars for convenience","Super comfortable and supportive. I love it.But the adjustable portion is in the back.I was bending over, putting on a mattress cover. A bra strap came apart. The way the bra is made, I the only way I could put it back together was to remove my shirt and bra and re- hook it.Glad it didn't happen during a yoga class or something.But I'm happy to find a comfortable sports bra in my size. So I'm going to continue using the product. It's so comfortable and supportive, that I'm using them for every day use."
5,Great for people with elastic and synthetic fabric allergies,"I was recently told that I have an allergy to elastic as well as synthetic fabric - this created a problem because almost every bra has elastic. I found this product which has minimal elastic and is mainly cotton. What a great product!!! My long standing rash around the bra straps and everywhere the elastic touched has disappeared. Would recommend it alone for that reason, but also it is a great fit. Whoever designed this product, my hat's off to you."
1,"Nice, in theory.","I needed another sports bra for running and the construction on this one looked really nice. When I got it however, the band and straps fit but.. the cups were entirely too big for me. I'm unsure of what we're basing these things off but, had it fit anyway.. it would have had too much stretch in the bust the prevent the dreaded bounce.I sent it back, got a refund and will not be purchasing this brand again."
2,not supportive,"I think this bra might be fine for small-breasted people, but it sure didn't work for me. Not supportive enough to wear in anything but really low-impact activities. Though it does look well made!"
3,"VERY comfortable, but sized wrong","I like how comfortable this bra is, and although all other bra's are at 40DDD this was to big, so will reorder in a smaller size. It's in the wash now, so hoping it will fit better after the second wash.. we'll see. I do LOVE Natori as rule."
3,Comfortable but....,this gave me a really weird shape. It was like two torpedoes pointing downward. Very strange. I sent it back.
4,Natori Women's Sport Bra,I like this bra. Great support. Great definition (no uni-boob). The material is really nice and straps adjust with a heavy duty metal hook. It is a keeper!
2,"Lasts awhile -- but when it's wet, it stays wet","I have had 2 or 3 of this bra, and it is pretty supportive (I'm a 36D) and lasts for awhile. But my problem with this bra came up in the summer -- once you are sweaty, the heavy cotton stays wet (and I am not a very sweaty exerciser!). This isn't too big of a deal if you're just doing a 30 minute run then promptly changing your clothes, but if you're going to be exercising for a longer period of time and/or can't change your clothes immediately, it's kind of disgusting and unhygenic to have the sweaty material against your skin.There are other bras that are more supportive and are made of material that wicks away sweat. (For example, I have switched to Champion's Powerback Sports Bra.)"
1,Not enough support to be a sports bra!!!,"Was so looking forward to this bra after seeing it on the TV show The Doctors. I am a large busted woman (40DDD) and have a very hard time finding a GREAT sports bra. It had no side support and the stretchy cotton material of the cups allowed my breasts to bounce way to much which is painful when jogging and exercising. Very, very disappointed!"
3,Not as supportive as described - still a lot of bounce.,"This is a quality bra and comfortable, but I am a 36DDD and found it not as supportive as I expected. There is still a lot of bounce if you are doing any type of jogging or horseback riding."
3,"Wouldn't call it a ""sports"" bra","I bought this for exercising during pregnancy while my breasts are larger than normal. It offered NO stability. I wouldn't use it for anything sports related unless it's yoga. However, the comfort and coverage made it a good maternity sleep bra."
2,Disappointed,"I used to own this bra years ago and I thought I remembered liking it. But now, the fit just isn't quite right. The wires bow out between my breast and with the cotton/spandex fabrication, I'm not supported or secure AT ALL!! The wires, however do hold me up but I need to be secure when I workout as well and not bouncing all over the place. I don't know If I got the right size; I ordered my bra size, but I can't remember if this brand ran small or larger. Overall I'm disappointed and I can't return it because I've already worked out in it. The color is FABULOUS though!"
2,I would not call it a sports bra,"I don't find that it gives any support and you definitely cannot run in it. Also, they need to put more lining in the cups. I would not buy it again."
5,Natori is fabulous,"I have tried several sports bras over the years and Natori is by far the best. Very comfortable, gives great support and last a long time. I'm hooked on this bra and will never purchase any other bra but the Natori."
3,"Bra is Pretty Good, but There Are Problems with the Strap","I got this bra because I wanted a sports bra that wouldn't create a ""uni-boob"", and it was good in that respect. Unfortunately, one of the straps routinely comes unhooked from the bra and slips off. I had to get a safety pin to keep it together. If it wasn't for that problem, I would rank it higher."
5,Love this bra!,I am a 38DDD and have the hardest time finding sports bras that fit. I bought this one on a whim and it is great! I needed something that was pretty supportive for riding horses and running and this one works beautifully! I will definitely buy more!
5,Comfortable & Fabulous!,"I'm a 40DD. The girls need support and this bra delivers. No uni-boob whatsoever. The girls are held beautifully in place. No side boob. In fact, the way the bra is designed, there is an extra piece of fabric on the sides that gives your chest a very flattering, shapely look. Also, the shoulder straps are perfectly spaced unlike some bras that fall down your shoulders and you're forever hiking them back up.The highest quality straps and fasteners of any bra I own. Does not loose support over time. Washes well.I now have one of these in every color. What I love about this bra is it's supportive enough for a workout yet comfortable enough for everyday wear. In fact, it's the most comfortable bra I own. I have 7 different brands of sports bras and all manner of regular dress-for-the-office bras, when all my bras are clean and I have the pick of the litter, this is the one I grab."
5,how to buy?,Hello. I still don't write well the linguage american.Please. I always did like of the CD SOUNDTRACK FRIGHT NIGHT.I am brazilian.
4,High way pegs,"High quality , wide , fully adjustable to fit any size rider. easily installed with allen wrenches and sockets."
3,Good quality,These are well made good quality. But I found them fairly difficult to install and the pegs are too big. If I would have researched more before my purchase I would have bought something else my legs aren't that long so to have the pegs where I can reach them they are sort of in the way due to there size
5,A classic worth a re-read,This is a minor classic which is worth a re-read for those who want to know why some books remain classics and most others disappear without trace. Its will also interest those who want to see how the standards of political correctness have changed over the past four decades while insightful writing skills remain. Re-read it and you'll see what I mean.
4,Wonderful Russian techno..,"I'm surprised that nobody has reviewed this album yet. I'm also surprised that there is only one Russki Razmer album on Amazon. Russki Razmer originated in Uzbekistan and has been in the music business for quite some time. The band has two men and one woman. In all, theye made about 6-8 albums and many singles. Compared to Ruki Vverh ... Russki Razmer deserves more credit and more attention. With songs like U-A-U and Angel Dnja (Angel of the Day), Best is definately worth the money..."
2,As Advertised,"Please note that this album is ""extended"", not ""improved"". So if your major complaint about the EXILE album was ""This album's horrible - the songs are too short!"", this should keep you happy. The rest of you, buy something else."
1,"doa, sound leaks","The headphones actually reproduced sound fairly well, but the noise reduction circuit was DOA. They also had fairly severe sound leakage -- you could hear about 40-50% of the volume if sitting next to them. Not for the traveler who thinks of the comfort of the people in the next seats. Nor did they seem comfortable enough for extended wear.Maybe these were just a bad pair, but I'll pass."
1,Noise Creating Headphones,"I've tried several versions of headphones (Bose QC2, QC3,Sennheiser PXC300, Sony MDRNC60), these fit the most comfortably around the ear, but there was a very sharp, shrill loud whistle sound out of the right ear cup when I rested my head against the seat or window of the airplane.Although the set felt sturdy, the plastic cups felt kind of lightweight and cheap. I'm so thankful for Amazon's return policy!Out of trying all these, I think I'll go back to Sennheiser PXC300."
3,"Noise Cancelling is great, but iPod music playback is poor!","Terrific noise cancelling, sounds as good as Bose, and these things fit very well and are comfortable and well made but still pretty lightweight.But, when using an iPod to play music, about 85% of the sound comes thru the right earcup, very little thru the left side. I've spent soooo much time with Panasonic technical support on this issue.They finally told me the product was made for portable CD players, not iPods. Are they nuts, there are about 100 million iPods in the world, and they make new headphones with bad 'balance' when connected to an iPod? I have not seen this in any product literature.So I'm stuck trying to decide whether to keep these for noise cancelling use only. I already have a pair of $150 Bose Tri-Port headphones that sound wonderful with an iPod.Panasonic is devious marketing these headphones. The beautiful black package says ""Stereo Headphones"" but they are not very ""Stereo"" with an iPod! Beware!"
1,Junk,"I got these for Christmas. When I turn on the noise cancelling, I get constant static and popping. It is loud and I cannot use these. Junk ! For the price they are demanding, this is not acceptable. Cannot recommend."
4,Overall Fine Product,I purchased these headphones for use in by cubed Office environment. They work for all but the loudest and highest pitched voices. Satifaction just so so.I then used them on an flight from the East Coast to the West Coast and WOW what a difference they made. I think they were made for use on an Airplane fantastic noise reduction. The low pitched engine noise and surrounding sounds were all elimnated. The Gold plated plug works awesome.For the serious Air Traveler I rate this a perfect 5 out of 5 stars and a must have !!!!!!
4,"Very effective, just not comfortable","I purchased these headphones in preparation for an international plane trip, but returned them before I departed. However, I'm certain they would've been extremely effective. I turned these on while standing in my kitchen with the clothes washer, dryer and dishwasher all buzzing away and was amazed by the noise reduction. It really works as advertised.The headphones feel solidly built and are well-cushioned. Ultimately they were not comfortable - they pressed too hard against my jaw bone, giving me a mild headache. No amount of repositioning would help, which is a shame because I *really* wanted to keep these cans. I have a narrow, somewhat small head and a ""sensitive"" neck, so I attribute the pain to my biology rather than the headphones, hence the four stars. If these headphones are comfortable on you, they're a great buy."
3,For smaller than average size ears,"Just purchased these earphones and while they work very well for the type of noise I need to reduce (e.g. riding lawnmower, air compressor), the ear pads are for small ears. They are quite uncomfortable for my ears which are about average size. They do not meaningfully reduce spoken sounds so a noisy seat mate on an airplane will be just as obtrusive."
4,Its a winner,Very pleased with these headphones when traveling. The noise reduction works very well and the fidelity coming off my IPhone is excellent . The price is a third of the BOSE which I heard had yoke problems. Worth the money.
1,Poor Customer Service,"I recently purchased 2 sets of these headphones (one set for my wife) after listening to a friends. Great sound, but the cable was bad on my set. Customer service is horrible and none of the CSR's speak good English. After an hour and half on the phone I gave up.I'm very disappointed in Panasonic and doubt I ever buy from them again."
1,RP-HC500 90 day warranty dead at 100 days - no service,The headphones died at 100 days and the minimum repair fee is $50 plus you have to ship them. They were used no more than 4 trips and the battery got stuck inside. Panasonic farms out the customer service calls to 'drones' and there is not much more to say. It looks like I will just throw them in a trash can now and upgrade to a headphone with a better warranty than 90 days.
1,"Reliability of ""made in China""","I wanted the headphones for my business trip to Japan(14 hours flight),and Amazon delivered it just in time which made me so happy, howeverthe product was deffective with terrible loud noise.Panasonic is wellknown brand but this kind of deffect damages its name I am gettingless and less confident in products made in China. Return policy ofAmazon helps me but I wasn't able to use it for my travel which wasso disappointing.I would like to avoid purchasing products made in China though itmight be difficult nowadays, I am afraid...."
2,NOT good at all for lawn care.,"I bought these just to test them out. Most reviews here are very favorable for canceling airplane noise, and for me, although in a VERY limited test of that (planes traveling above me), they totally eliminated the noise. But I bought these to cancel noise of my lawn equipment machinery. In that area, they are terrible. An inexpensive pair of Peltor (or similar) earmuffs is much more effective for that kind of usage.Deciding I wanted to return them, Amazon was FANTASTIC at taking them back and crediting my account. All delivery charges were paid for, including UPS picking the package up at my door."
5,"well made, great performance, bought another",This has been a great product for travel. It works on all Jets with a serene quietness and great audio performance. Very comfortable.Wore them to Europe and they were fantasatic for the whole flight. Comfortable and durable design.They even helped a ton on a Dash-8 US Airways plane. The blender that flies.Bought a pair for my Father for Father's day.
4,One Flaw:,"I've really enjoyed these headphones so far, its made my music seem new again. But when I plug in the two-way jack to the headphones, I only get full sound when its half way plugged in (on everything I've tried it on so far). If I plug it all the way, I only get sound in the right ear. Its kinda annoying, I don't know if I'm getting the best sound out of these headphones because of this flaw. At least they're good, and the sound canceling its great.EDIT: I returned them, the sound was not good enough because of this flaw."
4,Great Value,These Noise Canceling Headphones have performed exactly as promised. I have been very happy with them. They are sturdier than some of the other headphones I have tried.
5,Perfect for my needs,"I am delighted with these headphones. My impression is that Panasonic, though not a glamour brand, turns out a reliable, well-thought out product. I also liked the reviews, so I purchased this item. I was bothered by radio and TV sounds bleeding into my apartment from the neighbors. These headphones all but completely eliminated it.The noise cancellation works primarily on base tones. They reduce the base in any sound you are listening to, also. And they seem to be designed primarily for noise cancellation and not listening to music. If you are a stereophile, you might want to pick another model.However, I am delighted with them. They do what they do very well and what they do is exactly what I need them to do."
4,Looking for Silence,"I work and ride in loud areas. I would like a head set to remove the steady noise like jet engines and machinery running but enhance the spoken word.Bose limited the back ground hiss, the kind like a sea shell makes. Panasonic is better, 90% noise gone but voice, you still have to have someone talking loud right at you, to understand.Consumer Reports recommend a ear bud model, real cheap! I've read a few bad reviews. Haven't tried it.With digital inputs, all music sound great.There is still one model to check but I can't give my self to OK to spend $400."
4,Great Headphones,These headphones are awesome. The audio quality is crisp and clean and the noise canceling is AWESOME. I work in a noisy place and these put me in my own little world of great music. They are very comfortable as well. I did some research before buying these and I made the right choice.
4,Nice for the price,"These headphones are very nice. We used them on a recent flight and the noise cancelling worked well. The comfort is not as good as my husband's Bose headphones, but with the price we paid on Amazon we feel like we got a great value."
4,RP-HC500 Noise Cancellation Headphones,"Great headphones. Similar style and performance to a Bose set I used to have, all at a fraction of the cost."
4,RP-HC500,"Noise cancelling works well for the price. Works best on engine/air conditioning type noises 85-90%. Even blocks 60-70% of your own voice, really weird. Fairly sturdy. You better have tiny ears as they don't surround without touching. I have average size ears and they are 90% comfortable for a few hours."
5,Great Device,"These headphones do a remarkable job of reducing ambient noise while improving the sound of desired listening material. The phones are well made and come with a nice travel case to put in your carry-on. I tried several others including Sony, Bose, and Sennheiser and found these blocked the the most noise.Also, the Amazon price was great and the the phones arrived quickly. The local cost was over twice the Amazon price."
2,Broken Within Two Years,"These are (were) uncomfortable to wear, and the tight fit eventually resulted in the plastic breaking on the left earphone, rendering the headset unusable. The noise reduction was marginal, in my view. The sound for music and DVDs was pretty decent. If they had not broken, I would probably have been reasonably satisfied."
4,Pretty good,"I thought the headphones were broken when I first got them and connected them to my computer, but it turned out that the cable that came with the headphones was broken. Panasonic should have just sent me a new cable when I asked, but they wanted me to send back the whole package. It was cheaper for me to buy a new cable.Once I got the new cable, it works great for music.Noise cancellation work like lots of other 'noise canceling' headphones by generating white noise rather than active noise canceling. It's not as loud as some other headphones, and it's pretty effective at covering background noise, so I can't complain too much."
2,Item failed out of the box - suspect poor quality control,"I was happy to pull the item out the box, and immediately disappointed that I could only get sound from one side. Eventually I isolated the problem to a faulty stereo jack in the headphone. Insultingly, Panasonic made me pay to ship the item to their place in Texas, and adding injury to the insult, sent me a ""factory refurbished"" unit in its place. This should be illegal. I paid for a brand new item -- and received a used item that cost $10 more."
1,Dead on arrival,"Like several other reviewers, my earphones arrived with the left side dead. It seems like Panasonic should be able to fix that. I returned it to Amazon and will purchase a different brand."
2,expensive ear muffs,"Liked the headphones for the first 120 days, but then one side quit working and the warranty is only 90 days... expensive ear muffs."
2,Broke after about 80 days,"These broke about 80 days into the unbelievably short 90 day warranty. The right ear developed an intermittent crackling noise even when there was no cord attached.I shipped them back (at my expense) and Panasonic hassled me about fixing them under warranty. Eventually, they agreed and shipped me a refurbished unit, which works (for now). Now I just have to hope the second pair lasts longer than the first."
5,Great Quality for the Price,"I recently purchased these headphones for myself and my father. I was looking for a good quality noise reduction headphone and I had purchased the Bose Quiet Comfort 3 headphones for my husband last year ($400CDN)which I used as a comparator. Personally, I found these headphones to be more comfortable than the Bose with comparable noise reduction quality (I confess that I am not overly fussy about sound quality and my bigger priority was the noise reduction quality). Although the Bose are really the ""Mercedes"" of the noise reduction field, I am completely blown away by the qaulity of the Panasonic for the price I paid ($90US). I would unequivocally recommend these to anyone looking for a top quality noise reduction headphone without having to pay the price for Bose."
5,Panasonic RP-HC500 Better than Bose QuietComfort 2 & 3,The good: Eliminates all the background noise without introducing any other annoying sound. They are much cheaper too.:-)The Bad: The blue light on the side (power on). Flight attendances think is a wireless headset.Details:I have used these headphones for a while now and being a previous owner of a QuietComfort 2 & 3 I can tell you they are much better.The main deference is that with the Bose headphones is that while in use I still had the sensation of having an annoying sound but with the Panasonic RP-HC500 I do not hear any of the plane background noise.
4,Pretty good noise cancelling headphones,"I brought these headphones after reading the reviews at this site which was very helpful. I found it to be an excellent choice and have used it on some of my international trips already. I have not compared it head on with Bose but it has 95% noise canceling ability. I didn't realize till now how noisy it can get in an airplane and how helpful such headphones can be.I read a review on Amazon where there was a complaint that sound from only one side can be heard from an iPOD. I ran into this as well and the solution is to flip the connections on the wire connecting the headphone to the iPOD. Refer to the manual so the right end is connected to the iPOD. Once i did that, it worked perfect with my iPOD, laptop as well two other MP3 players I had.Overall, I am very satisfied with my purchase and thanks to Amazon for on time delivery."
1,"ALMOST a Great Product, Almost.....","This is a solid product, but it has one major flaw. The sound from the speakers does not stay inside the headphones. The headphones are loud, this allows other people to hear what you are listening to. The noise canceling feature is great, but because the headphones are too loud to outside people, I am returning them...."
2,Poor quality,"In terms of blocking noise, the headphones are okay compared to others that I've tried. Not exceptional, and the battery life is pretty poor, but they are decent. Otherwise, the product quality is terrible. I've had two pairs now (bought for me by other people, I didn't buy the same product twice), and both have snapped at the extension hinge on both sides after several months of use. I'm not using them in any abnormal ways, nor am I using them exceptionally frequently; the product quality is just bad. I will not be buying Panasonic in the future, and I do not recommend these headphones."
5,Panasonic RP-HC500 Noise-Canceling Headphones,These headphones are great! Already have used them on a flight. They worked perfectly! I'd rate them very high!
2,Excessive Noise Leakage,"I purchased these headphones and had to return them in one day because of the excessive sound leakage from the headphones. I was very impressed with the headphones overall for the price, but as soon as I cranked up my music even a little in a quiet room, the sound could be heard as far away as 8 feet with the headphones on my head! I took them to work and the person next to my work space could identify each song by name by listening to the music coming from the headphones! It would seem this is a sound issue that could be easily corrected by Panasonic."
1,Burst my Bubble,"With all the great reviews written, how could anybody have a second thought about purchasing these headphones? I took the bait and bought a pair only to receive them with a defective non-functioning left side. Whether plugged into a stereo to listen to music or for the N/C feature I was left with the right side only to do the work. Not acceptable."
1,Garbage,"I bought these in spite of the negative reviews and right out of the box they failed to work properly. I bought these for the noise canceling function, while the left ear worked fine, the right ear did not work at all. When I moved my head the left ear would give off static burst sounds. I sent them back to Amazon and purchased the Audio Technica ATH-ANC headphones and was much more satisfied."
1,garbage construction and great sound.,people use them for awhile then write a review.Im pissed! they broke the sliders on both sides. 6months apart.I have been holding them together with hockey tape....and I have become an audio nerd!run! don't buy this junk!!!!!I'm now looking closely at the construction of my next pair!!!ridiculous!!!!!!!!!RUN!!!! away this is junk!!!!No support either!!one star Panasonic do you hear me.I'd give you zero if I could.
4,Pleased!,"Panasonic RP-HC500 Noise-Canceling HeadphonesI purchased RP-HC500 based on earlier reviews. I have used it for about a month now. I am very satisfied with its performance. It was a relief to have these headphones during my recent air travel from NY to LA and back. I have not used any other noise cancelling phones to comment on comparative performance. My primary use is for listening recorded books.RP-HC500 comes in a convenient hard case. Power switch can easily be turned on and off. With the switch on, background random and low frequency periodic noise (including jet engine noise) is cancelled as claimed. Some high frequency engine noise leaks through, which I did not find annoying. I have used it at home in the kitchen. I can barely tell if the microwave is on or water is running from the kitchen faucet. Background conversation is muffled with the switch on or off.Overall I am very pleased with this product."
4,Good but not perfect,"Pro: great at canceling low-frequency noise, such as engine noise.Cons:1. Not good at canceling higher-pitch noise. So if your goal is to block out high-frequency noise like telephone rings, people talking, etc., this is not a good choice.2. Like other reviews indicated, the unit is a bit tight."
3,reasonable for the price,they are certainly more than adequate as noise reduction headphones for an air trip. My only complaints are1. they are not so comfortable after a couple of hours2. the detachable cord is pretty flimsybest of luck
4,Makes long flights much quieter,"These were my first NC headphones and they work pretty well. Not sure how much ""other"" sound Bose block out but I bought these primarily for aircraft engine drone/noise and they worked well, even without music or movie being pumped through them. I agree with reviewers who said that they are a bit uncomfortable/hot after prolonged periods but what wouldn't be after 7 hours? All in all, for the price and versatility they're a good find."
1,Rubber components degradation,"Bought a pair in Nov. 2008 and was very happy with the performance! Great noise-canceling capability specially on planes when I used to travel quite frequently.Sound quality was also superb.HOWEVER, IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS, I NOTICED THAT THE RUBBER SURFACES ON THE OUTER PORTION OF THE HEADPHONES HAVE STARTED DEGRADING AND HAVE BECOME VERY STICKY!I'VE BROUGHT THIS UP TO PANASONIC AND THEY SAY IT'S DUE TO NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR!THAT'S ODD AND I'D SAY POOR PRODUCT MATERIAL QUALITY.I'VE ONLY USED THE HEADPHONES ON A LIMITED NUMBER OF PLANE TRIPS (MAYBE 8 TIMES A YEAR) AND HAVE ALWAYS KEPT IT IN THE CASE.TWO AND HALF YEARS OF USE SHOULD NOT RESULT IN SUCH MATERIAL DEGRADATION.DISAPPOINTING."
3,"Not great, but not too bad","These phones are a lot better than ordinary ones but not perfect. Noise cancelling on a plane is very good for low frequencies but less impressive for engine whine. The other two ""cons"" are that they become uncomfortably hot and tight after an hour or so, and that when the NC is switched on the volume increases a good 10 db, which on some airplene sound systems means that they will be a little too loud even at the lowest armrest volume setting. The sound quality is excellent though."
4,No regrets,"I bought these headphones after spending $350 for the Bose (for my wife) and reading David Pogue's 7/14/2007 comparison of eight Bose competitors. I have no regrets - as Pogue wrote: ""You get quality that's nearly indistinguishable from the Boses -- for a third the price."" In fact, to my ear, the sound IS indistinguishable. The only quibble I have is that the tension of the headband is too tight because after extended listening I developed some mild soreness around my ears from the pressure. Haven't figured out a way to loosen the fit and probably never will since my wife now prefers the Panasonic to the Bose."
3,One of Bet's Best!!,"It's usually hit or miss with the made for Bet movies. I've seen quite a few of them and this one has been the best so far. With this series it boils down to the acting and this cast has some great chemistry. Both Cynda Williams and Marc Gomez give one of their best performances to date, but its Kim Fields portrail of 'the secretary' that will leave you wanting to see the movie for a second time. The plot is nothing new to the screen, but seeing it done with a 'cast of colour' is down right refreshing!!"
3,Not bad,"This is one I may consider adding to my collection. It was nice to see Kim Fields in something dramatic. This movie was also close to the book, where as some of the other movies veered to far from the book. I would recommend Hidden Blessings."
2,Biblical dribble,"This book was not what I expected. It did not contain authentic information on biblical foods nor did it contain recipes that the people of biblical times would have cooked. There may have been some exceptions to this but overall, it was not suitable for one who is truly interested in Biblical cuisine."
3,"OK, but works backwards","Last year I bought one of these for the driver's door and was surprised to find that the open/close direction is now reversed. That is, press the button for down and the window goes up. Recently the passenger door regulator broke, so I looked up the previous purchase and bought this one. I suppose I should not be surprised that the passenger door regulator exhibits the same reversed motion. I inspected the power connector very carefully - there is NO way to accidentally plug it in backwards, so the motor wiring must be backwards."
1,Failed within the six months,"This item is available for a great price, but the quality is terrible. If you can't afford the OEM, save until you can... You will end up spending more than the OEM when this part fails every few months. DO NOT waste your money. :-/"
1,Terrible!,This is an awful company. I ordered my products 15 days ago and they have yet to been delivered and everytime i try and contact someone from the company noone replies. when i called the number on their page i get some bank. So they pretty much just stole 81 dollars from me. Hopefully amazon will be able to refund it or im just screwed. If you want my advice buy from somewhere else.
5,Fantastic,"What an arragant response from Graboidz. Hey buddy if you didnt like this album and with a response as smug as that why did you bother leaving a review you jerk!Apart from that this album is really great. Its consistent all the way through and doesnt loose its energy at all throughout the album. The guitar playing is great and the vocals are really top notch. To most people Europe is just another hair rock/metal band with the song 'The Final Countdown', but this album proves that theyr're more than that. This album isnt commercial, it is more melodic in that sense. It has no keyboard drowning guitars out or has filler songs. It also has some really heavy stuff in here which I was really surprised about. Each song is perfect and makes the album even better as a new listener. This album is propper rockin' with great metal songs that could fit in with any NWOBHM band. If your a fan of 80s splitting rock/metal with a nice edge then this album is worth buying!5/5"
3,Worth it for their best song ever...,"...That song is ""Scream of Anger"". It never gets old. Just a mesmerizing, full throttle metal song with great vocals to add to the fantastic guitar playing. A real gem, that one. Aphasia and Dance the Night Away help make this release worth owning, too."
1,One Star for the Instrumental,"Everybody remembers ""The Final Countdown"" by Europe and that's about it. There is good reason for that. Europe stumbled upon a great keyboard riff, and used it to maximum effect on ""The Final Countdown"", the keyboard riff sold the song.Unfortunately on ""Wings of Tomorrow"" you don't get a cool keyboard riff, and while the music isn't bad, anytime lead singer Joey Tempest opens his mouth the songs are ruined. Tempest's vocals have all of the edge and rock quality of Michael Bolton. So while the guitar work is pretty decent, Tempest begins his ""ooohhhs"" and ""ahhhhhs"" and immediately makes the songs annoying, you will get douche chills for certain. I can't imagine paying more than $2 for this disk, and that would be for the instrumental ""Aphasia""...but even that isn't all that great, but to pay over $20 for this disk is a complete waste of money."
4,Stop what your doing and buy this album,"I love this album. Sure it's got some dud songs on it and is a little more American sounding. But when you get Dreamer on the same album as Wings of Tomorrow and Scream of Anger you know your dealing with a band that actually has feeling.The force with which the rockers hit my (then) teenage mind cannot be overestimated. Joey Tempests lyrics are at times fun loving and at other times deadly serious. He had really hit his stride and the band sound fully focussed on this release.Some people hated their next album, The Final Countdown, but if it wasn't for the success of that album most people wouldn't of gotten to hear that this album and it's predecessor existed. and that would be a real shame."
3,Well worth a listen,"Europe is a little heavier with a rawer production on this album. John Norum is a great guitar player and he plays well on this album. The instrumental ""Aphasia"" is a good example of how he plays. ""Open your Heart"" is a good ballad, and the title song ""Wings of Tomorrow"" is pretty heavy with a good vocal chorus. Not as good as The Final Countdown, but still is a good album."
4,Their best,"Top to bottom, the best Europe release, by far. If you're a fan of '80s metal, but aren't sure about Europe because all you heard was the schlock of Final Countdown (good schlock, but schlock nonetheless), buy this. Not a bad track here. Guitarist John Norum is outstanding. Check out his outstanding solo CD as well, called ""Total Control"" ... Went on to be a quite able replacement for George Lynch in Dokken.This CD holds the original version of ""Open Your Heart"" which was bastardized two CDs later. ""Aphasia"" is one of the best metal instrumentals of all time - and ""Dreamer"" is one of my favorite mellow tunes of the era/genre."
3,Adds Nothing New,"Ask the Children is an interesting book, but one that could be, and probably has been, summarized in a much shorter Parents Magazine article and still be quite useful. Bottom line, the fact that both parents work does not affect children as much as how their parents treat them affects them. Still, this would be an excellent resource for research purposes. I just don't think you need to spend your money simply because you are interested in the topic."
4,This is the student workbook.,"Although this is an outstanding series, I thought I was ordering the teachers version of this book. This is the student workbook. It is still a great series though."
4,A Great Introduction to the Works of James Thurber,"If you are not aware of the world of author/artist: James Thurber, {1894-1961}, this wonderful book is a fine place to be introduced to his work.This book contains all the stories from: ""The Owl in the Attic"", ""The Middle-Aged Man on the Flying Trapeze"", ""Let Your Mind Alone!"" and ""Other More or Less Inspirational Places"". Thurber's dry wit and sense of humor is timeless. The stories found here are of an American tradition of great authors such as: Mark Twain and Bill Mauldin. And with the addition of 125 cartoons from Thurber's pen, this book is quite a feast for the eyes.I am not going to go into great detail about the contents of this book, as these pages speak for themselves quite nicely. I am a big fan of this man's work and I believe anyone who buys this will enjoy it greatly.James Thurber; ""American Original""...""92 Stories""...FOUR STARS !!!"
4,Mostly Great,"This book is a mostly funny collection of Thurber's stories and essays. Many show off Thurber's keen insight into the foibles of human nature told in a deadpan funny way. Especially good are his stories that he creates from scratch, and his satirical stories. However I found his pieces on the English language boring and the section where he lampoons self help books to be petty and whiny. Also interesting is the glimpse you get into the culture of the 30's which you can only get by reading the daily writing of the time. In all a good book to read since it is easy to skip the parts you don't like."
3,You get to pick and choose.,"This book is a mostly funny collection of Thurber's stories and essays.

Also interesting is the glimpse you get into the culture of the 30's which you can only get by reading the daily writing of the time. In all a good book to read since it is easy to skip the parts you don't like."
2,false advertisement,"It is not a TRUE 4 Ga.wire, the exterior is the correct size, but the actual working wire size is 8 Ga. max. Granted I use both on a regular basis, just letting you all know what your buying so you are not surprised like me when it arrives."
1,Not as good as the Bee Gees,"Yes that's right! How can you possibly better the 2nd biggest group since the Beatles? The answer - you can't. There are no interesting arrangements here, just a load of pointless revamps, which change hardly anything except the voices. Which makes you wonder why the even bothered recording this CD in the first place!"
3,Not as good as the real thing,"I saw Saturday Night Fever on Broadway and was surprised how much I enjoyed it. The singing and dancing were really energizing. The London cast version, however, falls flat in comparison. It's not as spunky. If you were going to buy the CD in the hopes that it would be like the Broadway version, I would not suggest it. If you like the songs and want to hum along, then go for it."
1,SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER?,Hardly...If you like broadyway go see the show but skip the recording...this ones not the inspiration that SNF was.Bad vocals and a bland re-recording of orignals.the only hope here stems from 'Immortality' a great Gibb song but wait for a better recording of it on some best of broadway cd.
5,An incredible mixture of style and charisma.,I saw this production in December of 98 in London. Adam Garcia is amazing in his lead role. I was blown away by his dancing and singing ability. This CD is a direct translation of this stage production in all it's grandeaur.
5,Book review,"I had not seen this book in over 30 years, was thrilled to find such a nice copy at a great price."
4,Out the Shizzy,"I love this album, G and Rueben said are my favs, if you're into early 7 seconds it may piss you off like it has done to tons of people, it is more close to grunge than punk rock, kind of resembles Tripping Daisy or 311."
4,A fascinating tale of gay buccaneers,"It's too bad this book is out of print. The stories and lives of Caribbean privateers (careful, don't call 'em pirates) revealed in this book are indeed intriguing. Some of M.S. Hunter's fabrications such as the existence of an Italian island in the Caribbean are a bit baffling, yet his rendering of a fairly utopian interracial (albeit a bit misogynist) buccanneering society is captivating. Though, granted, I picked this book up because of my interest in gay fiction, the book would be of interest to a general open-minded readership. The book's erotic passages are thankfully short enough not to interfere with the story which is far more interesting. Because of this novel, I am much more interested in reading other literature concerning the adventures of buccaneers."
1,Please be careful with this,"I actually believe this stuff is potent enough to kill someone. My friends please be careful. I basically use 1 capsule and break it down into 5 dosage since it is so damn potent.And believe me it is potent but not in a good way. Increased heart rate, nausea, body ache all that but 10 times worse than you can imagine. You have been warned."
4,good chik rock,"I knew these chicks so this is just part low advertising on my part, but their cover of Sheena is a Punk Rocker is bitchin'. Dig it."
3,Jasmine is not quite as popular as the other Princesses,"My daughter received this for Christmas, but she is not in to it as much as her other costumes. Maybe she will warm up to it later,"
5,Remarkable,Fathering Words is a deeply moving memoir. Ethelbert Miller's description of his father will remain with the reader for a very long time. His decision to write the book using both his and his sister's voice is unique and it works.It's definitely a keeper.
4,Great Music,"This is a great CD of Ricky Skaggs top singles from the 1980s. It was performed live at the Dominion theatre in London, England.He performed many of his top hits such as ""Hearbroke"" and ""Honey (open that door). He also did a duet on ""Don't get above your raising"" with Elvis Costello."
2,"MTV has a new meaning to ""Uncensored""","I am a HUGE Tom Green fan.I have all of his videos and his DVD Endangered Feces.This video is not even uncensored.It just has people who work for Tom telling about their expierences with Tom.ALL the skits are bleeped out and all of them are also censored.They should call this video which is my idea:Tom Green,Behind the Laughs.But no,they call it this.It still is an ""ok"" video but I expected it to have no bleeps and everything.The only videos that are from him that are uncensored are:Something Smells Funny,Tonsil Hockey,and Endangered Feces.They at least could play the whole skit without them innterupting every 2 seconds talking about useless information that people could care less about.But all of other Tom's videos and DVDs besides this one."
2,Hmm... pretty boring,"Although this wasn't absolutely terrible, it was awfully boring for the most part. It's just a bunch of interviews and old clips, entertaining for a while. Some of the stuff that they reveil is actually quite interesting, and this tape could be considered almost like a biography focused around the time of his show. There were some new clips, but it really wasn't all that great."
2,Tom Green Show: Total Crap,"Hi!This is my review of the Tom Green show MTV issued video ""Uncensored,"" which SHOULD have been titled ""Behind the Scenes and Boring Interviews With the Cast, Producers, and Anyone Who's Directly or Indirectly Involved with The Tom Green Show.""It is what I have just said. This is the SAME EXACT thing MTV broadcast during their ""uncensored"" week, and it is DEFINATELY NOT uncensored.If, however, you are interested in what exactly goes into the Tom Green Show, you might enjoy this! It's insightful, thoughtful and contains very few actualy full skits from the show, and even LESS unreleased/uncensored video!For a better view of TRUE uncensored (for the most part) Tom Green, check out ""Something Smells Funny,"" or ""Tonsil Hockey,"" also available on Amazon.com.This is soely my opinion. I LOVE the Tom Green Show, and have been following it for years (quit laughing!), but this is just another ploy for MTV to make some money. Well, they got mine.--Drake"
2,Might as well be called Tom Greens producers uncensored.,"Now don't get me wrong, I'm not one of those Tom Green haters. In fact, hes one of my favorite celebrities and I happen to think that he is a comedic genius. Unfortunately, I have to give this DVD 2 stars and that is all that it deserves.The title is completely misleading, Tom Green Uncensored. I would have to say Tom is only shown in about 35% of this movie, and the rest of it are his producers telling us about the show. About the uncensored part, everything that has been shown bleeped out on MTV is still very much CENSORED on this movie.Not once is a segment from his real show seen on this in its entirerty, and some of his funniest segments aren't even on here. And for a DVD, this is some of the worst sound i have ever heard, even on VHS!Sadly, all of you Tom Green fanatics like me out there will have to wait for something more representative of this crazy and hilarious Canadian to actually warrant a purchase."
1,A DVD about Tom without Tom,"This is the worst. There are no segments. Totally forgettable. And it's people talking about episodes without the episodes, and none of these people you care about. If anything, this would be an ""extra"" included on the DVD collection of episodes, not a DVD in itself. MTV bites.. I am so happy he left them. I cannot give it 0 stars, so the one star goes to the DVD interface. It was the only thing laughable about the DVD."
2,Disappointing,"Don't be fooled by the title of this video, ""Uncensored."" It is NOT uncensored. It's only a video getting a behind-the-scenes perspective on the show. It shows already seen sketches with crew members discussing them. They're all censored, just like on the show. Unless this is what you want, this video isn't nearly as good as all of Tom Green's previous releases."
3,Sin dudas un buen disco,El peyote es probablemente la mejor banda uruguaya y una de las mas destacadas dentro del pobre panorama de la música latina. Un buen disco de una banda que seguro seguira creciendo.
3,I think its alright,"For who ever wrote that junk about cash money is not gone to run the nation with these hits are hating becasuse cash money is better then any record label in the country , but nolimit is also good In this for all the haters out there to let yall no they tried hard to get where are but cash money will still be on top."
4,Put's No Limit back where they belong,"Da Crime Family is tight, could of been better, as in they have too many slow songs on it. HOODY HOO will be a hit so will TRU HOMIES. No Limit has been putting some weak stuff out, but I think Cash Money is giving some pressure. Speaking of them, all of the sudden No Limit is claiming Uptown, in NO LIMIT ARMY, which is like Cash Money's BG ""CASH MONEY IS AN ARMY"" on Chopper City. Overall bout time No limit came out with some bout it shit, but there is no Mystikal on here."
3,no limit iz slowly fading,a couple phat tracks but overall a disappointment DIG holds it down wit magic but thats 1 of few tight jams
3,Not the best but it is a tight cd,"I think no limit needs to stop making so many records because, if you buy a no limit cd their are proubly 2 good songs on the cd. And their best would haft to be TRU 2 DA GAME."
3,"nothing new here, but worth the money","Well, those boys are back after each releasing platinum plus albums in 1998. Unfortunately, its the same as usual. P's tired rymes and Silkk's flawed flows hurt this album. Fortunately there is C-Murder, who can provide a distraction when you're getting tired of the other two. More gangsta cliches are to be found here as with most NL albums, and the beats are not quite as good. Since the departure of Beats by the Pound, NL has suffered. Due to this a lot of the beats are done by C-Murder's production team, Deadly Soundz. All in all, Tru's album does not cross any new ground, but it can be praised for its new talent as well as standout tracks such as ""Hoody Hoo"" and ""It's a beautiful thing"" with Snoop and C-Murder."
2,Master P has lost it,Master P needs to spend a little more time rappin' and not making movies and playing ball. C-Murder is the only thing saving this album.
3,AVERAGE AT BEST,"THIS TRU ALBUM DID NOT SEEM TO FOLLOW IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF PAST TRU ALBUMS. THERE WERE FAR TO MANY GUEST AND A LACK OF THOSE TRADITIONAL DOWN SOUTH SWAMP BEATS THAT BEATS BY THE POUND USUALLY DELIVERS. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF AFEW TRACKS, THERE WAS TO MUCH POP AND FILLER TRACKS SUCH AS ""BUSS THAT"" AND ""WE RIDERS"" TO NAME A FEW.AND ONCE AGAIN AFTER RECEIVING HEAVY CRITICISM FOR HIS REMAKE OF AN UNRELEASED 2PAC TRACK, C-MURDER COMMITTED HIP HOP BLASPHEMY ONCE AGAIN BY NAMING A SONG HAIL MARY WHICH WAS PAC'S SONG. ANYWAYS, TRU MADE THE SAME MISTAKE THAT ALOT OF RAP ARTISTS ARE MAKING BY RELEASING DOUBLE ALBUMS. THEY WOULD BE BETTER SERVED BY JUST CONDENSING THEIR ALBUMS AND DROPPING ONE SOLID RELEASE, BECAUSE OTHER THAN PAC AND BIG NONE OF THESE ARTISTS HAVE ENOUGH HEAT TO DROP 2 ALBUMS."
1,Why would such an awful CD be produced?,I bought this album because everyone I knew was buying it that day. There isn't a single song on it worth listening to. Skip this album for sure. I learned a good lesson by buying this: don't be a follower.
2,The same Tired Rowdy Usual stuff from No Limit,"There is a legitimate reason why this double CD stinks. It was being recorded around the same time Cash Money was beginning to take away No Limit's crown. It shows, as the Miller clan tried a little too hard, and ended up with only a single disc's worth of good tracks. Among the VERY FEW standouts are ""Hoody Hoo"" and ""Soldier till I Die."" Best advice--save your money."
5,Stop Hating on No Limit,This album got some tight cuts. On their 3rd Tru album No Limit recruited some new soldiers and The New soldier DIG is talented. No Limit also found a new producer called Sugar Bear and he dropped some hot beats on this album. This album is almost good as Tru to da Game. But it doesn't suck at all most of the songs are tight. And P probably ruined just 1 song that I can think of in this album. This is a must buy.
4,the best tru album,this album is so far the best tru album and with the guest apperance from the NO LIMIT tank makes it interesting amd still bumping
5,DA BIZOMB,"THIS ALBUM IS OFF DA HOOK. C, P AND SILKK KEEP THIS ALBUM BANGIN. IF U R A ''TRU'' NO LIMIT FAN PICK THIS 1 UP EARLY. CASH MONEY **** YALL"
4,This CD Is Awesome,No Limit still can't beat Cash Money but this is a great joint. Hoodyhooo is rocking.
3,its alright,I COULDNOT WAIT TIL THIS CD CAME OUT BUT IT WASNOT LIKE I WOULD HOPE IT TO BE BUT HOODY HOO AND TRU HOMIES GOT SOME GROOVES
3,NO LIMIT WILL NEVER BE THE SAME,"ever since P stopped rappin like how he did on the old TRU no limit was never the same, da last don will be there last big hit unless they get rid of these rookies, P needs to get another album out and get rid of everyone except the originals. lil soldiers was too far, whoever bought that is whipped over no limit, P sounds like hes an R&P singer."
2,ONCE AGAIN..... NO LIMIT BITIN THEMSELVES,"SORRY, ALL U NO TALENT SOLDIERS, BUT ""DA CRIME FAMILY"" JUST ISN'T WHUT IT USED 2 BE. I REMEMBER WHEN ""TRU 2 DA GAME"" CAME OUT... IT WUZ HOT! NOW, NO LIMIT HAS GOTTEN SO COMMERCIAL THAT THEY JUS BASICALLY SUCK. I LIKE VINTAGE NO LIMIT AND THEY NEED 2 STOP BITIN OFF OF THEMSELVES. ALWAYZ TALKIN ABOUT TANKS, TATTOOS, AND SCREAMIN UGH!LIKE MP GOTTA DROP A FEW LOGS. NEWAYZ, NO LIMIT NEEDZ 2 BRING EM BACK 2 '95 & '96 INSTEAD OF SCREAMING HOODY HOO AND JUMPING AROUND LIKE INSANE MONKEY IDIOTS. HEY, HEY, I AIN'T HATIN, I'M JUS KEEPIN' IT REAL!"
2,They have better skillz than this.,"I am probably the biggest NO LIMIT fan in the world, but for some reason I don't like this album. I like the last TRU album. They have some stupid songs on there, but Hoody Hoo and Hard Niggaz are knockin'."
2,"no limit is no longer no limit ,they`re fading with the rest",NO LIMIT used to be a sure cd to buy no mater who`s cd was being released.Now i`ve got to listen to the whole cd just to see if it`s worth buying at all. formerly NO LIMIT`S #1 fan!
1,A WASTE OF MONEY,"I've been a NO LIMIT fan since da beginning, but recently their albums are declining in quality. This album has got to be da worst put out by NO LIMIT. There are maybe 3 or 4 songs worth listening to on two cd's. They could have released a mini cd for that matter. And what's up with all this singing on just about every song on the album. This album should be in the R&B section. NO LIMIT better start putting more effort in their work, or people will stop buying their music based on their name."
1,skip this rap CD,"if you're a fan of rap music or no limit records skip this album and pick up some of their older and better quality releases. I hate to use a stupid hip hop word but this album is wack. Avoid it at all costs. It's 100% filler!!or if you're sick of no limit in general scoop the latest from Cash Money Records or perhaps Pastor Troy's ""We Ready I Declare War"" which acutally disses no limit.In general though.. skip this garbage album."
2,GOOD BUT NOT GOOD ENOUGH!,Where has no limit gone??? The old tru is about real gangsta $*%#!!! This is wack. No Limit needs to remember where they came from. They came from the projects and they do not make good rich people. what happened to killin and slangin to make money. Come on P!! The only real soulja's you have now is mystikal and c-murder. And even c-murder is gettin weak!!! Lets get it together P. Make us say ugggg again!!!
1,"THIS ALBUM IS TO SOFT, NO LIMIT IS GETTING WACK","This album sucks. I don't see how all u people are sayin g this is one of the best NL cds of the year. There is to much singing on this cd it is not enough hard core hoody hooo is the only good song on here and it is stupid too what the hell is a hoody hooo anyway serv-on and sillk are the only half way decent cds they put out this year. Like I said before THE LAST GOOD NL CD PUT OUT WAS BIG ED AND THAT WAS SEPT 1. NO LIMIT GO BACK TO BEING HARD CORE AND STOP WITH ALL THE SINGING, THAT'S WHAT HAPPEN TO BONE."
1,this cd is a crime really,this whole cd sucks c murder's remake of hail mary is awful c must be smoking crack hoody hoo is the only decent trtack on here don't waste yopur money on this trash.
1,Don't Waste Your Cheddar,Master P is a joke and he think he can continue fooling the public by putting out wack albums. The party is over for him and he knows it. Ca$h Money is where it's at. I will neva buy another album from their crew again!
5,The hobo philosopher,"This is a great book covering a dynamic period of American history. This is the last volume of a lifetime of work and investigation by Page Smith. I have a copy of every volume but I have not read them all. I have read this one in its entirety. It is very good, thorough and very informative. Mr. Smith has accomplished quite an achievement - a life time achievement. To read and study this entire series by Mr. Page Smith I concider the equivalent of a Master's Degree in American history. I intend to do just that. I applaud and thank you for your efforts Mr Smith.Richard Noble - The Hobo Philosopher - Author of:America On Strike - American Labor History"
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"unless you are a complete skeptic, you will find this book biased and lacking examples from the successes of using psychics as a tool in investigations. None of the legitimate psychics used by law enforcement officials claim to ""solve"" cases."
5,So far to good,"These laces are good. They need to be softened up before use, but after that they are strong and have broken yet."
3,Free SF Reader,"THE CAPTAIN OF THE POLE-STARJ. HABAKUK JEPHSON'S STATEMENTTHE GREAT KEINPLATZ EXPERIMENTTHE MAN FROM ARCHANGELTHAT LITTLE SQUARE BOXJOHN HUXFORD'S HIATUSA LITERARY MOSAICJOHN BARRINGTON COWLESTHE PARSON OF JACKMAN'S GULCHTHE RING OF THOTHAn interesting SF story is 'The Great Keinplatz Experiment'. The Ring of Thoth even gives you an Egyptian mummy sort of story, so there is definitely a broad range of tales to be had here."
5,the best shoes i have ever wore,"These shoes are amazing! The first time I wore them, I went to a festival for 5 hours and my feet never hurt! They are so comfy! The best part is they make my size 9 look like a size 6. I love these shoes!!!!"
4,"Kevin Williams: Dranzer, meet gas!","This blade is alsome. The attackring, the best part of the beyblade, features a five star attack design which isn't fake. The weight ring is average, and the only thing keeping Dranzer GT from perfection, I recommend an eight-wide (dragoon) weight ring. One of the gimmicks is the removable base tip, which is fine to begin with, that can be replaced. I recommend an endurance tip from Flame Pegasus. Overall, perfect....."
5,Four Seasons Vivaldi Heaven,"This is my absolutely all time favorite rendition of Vivaldi's Four Seasons. I first checked it out of the public library and knew that I had to own a copy of this. This music can be quiet, yet motivational, and inspires me to write, exercise, and can yet be soothing enough to put me to sleep. I love this CD."
2,"""OK Action, But Needed A More Solid Plot.""","A renewel of the Korean War always makes for interesting fodder. However, Douglass could have handled it better. Also, better editing was needed. I noticed too many errors and inaccuracies for the standard paperback. The action scenes were OK. The missions got tougher as the book went on. Still I think the SEALS should have encountered a tad more difficulties. Did not get a real enough sense of the danger they were in. Plus character development was really lacking. The book was basically a series of missions the SEAL Team went on in Korea. It would have been better to have one central plot with a few other little missions thrown in on the side. Concentrating a three or four of the SEAL characters would have helped. All in all, this book had the markings that it was rushed into publication."
1,Would Have Been Good,"I am sure that this would have been a good controler...but for some reason, everytime you turn your Dreamcast off, when you turn it back on the controler won't work. It won't work until you unplug it and plug it back in."
4,Shocking,I like its color. Me and hubby dont mix up our controllers. Its a fun color. Basically the regular control pad. but adds a little pizzazz to your life. Have Fun!!!
5,Classic,"This is his best since ""Good Ole Boys"" and that goes back 30 years.""My Country"" -- Subtle and great. ""I'm Dead"" Only Randy Newman can make fun of himself (or is he making fun of the critics?). ""Great Nations of Europe"" If Madonna sang this, I would still know who wrote it. ""I Miss You"" Best love song since ""Marie"" 30 years ago. Who else would write a love song to his ex-wife? I just wish Randy would focus more on this type of album and less on movie scores. I don't want to wait ten more years."
5,Bad Love,"It has been years since Randy Newman has come out with a regular album. It was well worth the wait. Newman has always been the master of cynical song, but in his newest album, he puts that aside for a more mellow, self-respective setlist. While humor is abundant in this record, there are several songs that contain pure emotion, about lost loves. A great mixture of humor and sadness."
3,doesn't fit right,wire connector is does not reach unless u stretch the wire. ford focus v6 2001 also the valve came with wrong gasket!
4,A visual treat that captures the thrill of Lindy's flight,"Mike Wimmer's art grabs the eye immediately and doesn't let go. The brief, staccato storytelling is effective, but mainly as an augment to the beautiful visuals, perhaps contrary to expectations. Through the use of atmospheric colors and close-up views of Lindbergh and his plane, you're there to share the thrill, exhilaration, and terror of the solitary pilot. This is a perfect book to convey the excitment of flying--especially its early days--to young readers, and a fine tribute to one of America's great men."
4,The Air Up There,"The Dramatic story of an American Hero, the first to fly over the Atlantic Charles Lindbergh. This was a great book with good information and dates about Lindbergh's journey. The illustrations were awesome, I believe the illustrator used watercolors to paint the pictures in the book but gave them a very realistic feel. The story was just enough to know what was happening, the dates, and how Lindbergh became an American hero. Would recommend."
1,nintendo 64 controller,VERY DISAPPOINTING PRODUCTThe new controllers are nice to look at but lack the stamina of the original controllers.The button joystick is much smaller on the shaft and breaks easily.Won't hold up to the use they should be designed for.Expected much better
4,Grown and Sexy!!!,"Classic Adrienne Byrd: a little humor, some drama and whole lot of heat! Great storyline with characters who were a little older, which made them, IMO, a little more relatable. Loved it and didn't want it to end!Thanks for re-issuing this one!"
5,I Loved It,"I loved this book!!! The hero is strong, loving, paitient, determined and the relationship was ""steamy and hot"" it is a must read. Thank you Ms. Byrd"
4,Great Comfort Story,"This story was extremely enjoyable. Brooklyn was a wonderful character that has been hurt and was fearful of being hurt again like so many women. Isaiah has been hurt as well but his desire for Brooklyn allowed him to pursue his desire. It was a great read from beginning to end. Now the supporting characters. I loved the relationship between Yasmine and Isaiah, I hope Ms. Byrd uses that type of friendship in future stories. I absolutely could not stand Macy (enough said on that). This book is definitely in my re-read stack.I don't want to spoil the story and my review is from my point of view. Pick it up and check it out for yourself. I always welcome feedback from my reviews. Happy reading."
4,Very daring approach!,This book was a good read. Brooklyn's approach was very daring. I love dares! Many women can relate to this story! Ladies...don't tell your friends everything about your relationship with your man...this book is the perfect example of why not to and it also shows hope and that good things may come from a bad situation!
3,recycled but liked it,"Comfort of a Man is about a divorcee, Brooklyn, who is not the happiest. Her husband left her for her ex-friend and she is often fighting with them, and it doesn't help that her teenage son seems to blame her and prefer his father over her. While on vacation with her girlfriends, she is basically peer pressured into having a one night stand. She just wants the night but he wants more, and fate is on his side because they are brought together again.I felt like a lot of the story line has been done before which was a negative. I also didn't like her best friend. She was too pushy and bossy. It's fine to be truthful and tell it like it is, but she was over the top and turned out to be annoying.Even though the story seemed like it had been done before and even with the annoying friend it was still an enjoyable read and I really did like the couple. Adrianne Byrd really does knows how to create chemistry and turn up the heat!"
3,had one fail the other day,i had one of the these tapes fail on me the other day at a shoot. i lost a few minutes footage before i noticed. i hae used close to hundred of these tapes and never had a problem before so i guess you can expect a dud once and a while. but i still would expect more from a professional quality tape.
1,False Advertisement,"Well today I received my order, unfortunately only 1 cassette was sent. Using a picture of ""10"" mini digital professional cassettes to advertisement, and claiming that the saving would be 90% is WRONG - I can assure you that I will never buy any Panasonic products ever again. USING A PICTURE OF 10 CASSETTES IS VERY MISLEADING AND VERY CONNIVING."
4,from what i understand and experienced so far,no problems with recording or playback; good basic function; integrity over a long period of time and use remains to be seen ...
4,I use these exclusively.,I have a part-time videography business and I use these 83 minute tapes exclusively. They are good quality and I don't have to change them out as frequently as you have to do with the 63 minute tapes. I don't think I've ever had any problems with them.
1,"Worthless, don't waste your money","All of the other books I purchased on buying a home in France were far superior to this one, which provided only anecdotal information that was not helpful at all."
1,Only an engineer would love,Loved the look and quality of the watch but DANG....It's too darn confusing. To get the watch set correctly you need an MIT degree. Ughh... buying a simpler watch next time.
1,CALIBRACION,"Hello buy this watch but I live in Mexico and not how to put it at the time, it automatically makes the time in USA and Japan but as I do to Mexico?another question works in other countries?"
2,Not very effective,"I got these caddies for my clawfoot (I got 2 of them). 1st, they were way bigger that I had imagined. That part wasn't so bad, but they don't stay on the tub! If you want them to stay you have to bend the metal arm to grab the tub- which seems odd. Also- the metal arm is covered by rubber, but the metal basket (which is what is resting on the tub surface) is not covered in a material that will not scratch the inside of the tub! Also the thing doesn't sit level no matter HOW much you bend the arm - everything (soap/shampoo bottles/shave cream) FALLS OUT!! So far no scratches - ok - but we are also super careful. But who wants to have to think that much when it is still dark out and you just woke up and you are stumbling into the shower before work? These may end up at the Goodwill... so if you want them for a buck a piece I'd say go look there."
3,Useful,"This product is useful if you have an old-style tub that a shower caddy won't fit on. I was a little disappointed that it bends out of shape so easily and it's not very strong, so heavy bottles won't work. But it helps out a lot in giving extra space!"
4,Zombies!!! Military Base Expansion.,"This is a good Addition to Zombies!!! You will need the main base to play this expansion. If you like the main game you will like this expansion. It contains 15 Map Tiles for a Military Base, new cards, and Six Glow in the Dark ""Military Enhanced"" Zombies figures. The new Zombies move 2 spaces and are only killed on a roll of 5 or better. I give it 4 out of 5 and not 5 because I wish there were more rules about the Super Zombies and how to increase their number."
5,Fun for everyone,Zombies!!! is a fun game that anyone can get into. It is my go to board game for non board gamers. It is nice because you can kind of choose the length of the game by moving the helipad closer to the top of the tile deck. It's also nice that every game is different because you are building the board every game. Make sure you have a lot of room to play because the board can become pretty big sometimes. Now I just need to get some of the expansions.
4,"A high quality Album: I give him 4,5 Stars",Well its a great album. It`s like Pearl Jam after a Tibet tirp with some opium in it. Or simply beautyful and amazing
3,They're ok,"I decided to try these because of all the great reviews, but I wasn't as impressed as I hoped I would be. I put these in a pair of heels and they did make them more comfortable, but they didn't work any miracles. I had really hoped they would help stop my foot from sliding forward, but they didn't seem to have any affect on that."
5,Every pair of pumps should have cushions like these!,"These are a live saver for every uncomfortable pair of pumps I own. I never have to sacrifice my tootsies for fashion again! The hardest part (for me) is finding the right spot to stick them. You have to be careful to only apply them once, twice if you absolutely have to, or the glue won't last and they'll start to slide. (I found this out when I got the heel cushions.) So if you're sitting there deciding on whether or not you should purchase these for your comfort, DO IT! You won't be disappointed. I only wish I found them earlier!"
3,So-So,"They are ok, although I'm not really impressed: I wear heels lower than 6 cm (less than 3"") only, so this product didn't have to perform any miracle. They are thinner than I thought they need to be to relieve the pain, but at the same time they are too thick, so the toes are squeezed inside the toe box. As in order to get the best of them I would need to buy shoes one size bigger, just like I did when I had to wear orthopedic insoles, I don't think I would buy them again."
3,Thinner than I expected,This product was a lot thinner than I expected it to be. I would probably go with a full shoe insert next time.
5,Teegarden Review,"A great book containing pictures, history, and stories on Teegarden ancestery. I bought the book for my girl friend and now am buying two more copies for other members in her family. One of the best buys for the money that I've seen. Does have a couple of errors, but is a great source."
5,"Awesome, Awesome, Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",I think that the song Carry me by Max Meyer was one of the best songs I have ever heard. I feel that there is no other song better suited for the situations that our Country is currently going through. Kudos Max Meyer!!!! You're Awesome!!!!!
4,Intimations of a Savage Heart,"This book is a revelation. Imagine a context in which one could sit down and listen to the intimate ruminations of a much admired writer. Reading this book is like being invited to a private sphere where the author shares herself in the act of writing. One need not be acquainted with Lispector's work in order to get something out of this text. Cutting to the quick, her simple yet agile prose reveals a serious mind at work, a mind that works likes a pair of scissors to cut away the excess of life. What is left is the essential, which is also the inexpressible. Her short vignettes will leave one speechless, with the feeling that what she is writing is exactly what one was thinking."
4,exceptional,this album has a wonderful combination of top figures in the gospel music scene.wonderful vocals by sixpence none the richer and jaci velasquez.worth listening to.
2,nice but very delicate,"nice detailing & great looking military toys but very, very delicate and not for playing with"
1,Not the right item,"I would recommend NOT to buy from this company. They ship substitute products and do not respond to you inquires. Clearly, this is not a reputable business. STAY AWAY!"
2,lipozero,I have tried it for over 30 days and haven't noticed any difference. Ihad never heard of white bean extract until Dr. Oz mentioned it onhis show.
2,Poorly written,"This textbook often states the very obvious, and uses a lot of words while not saying much. A pretty disappointing book."
2,Kindle edition and pagination not accurate to print!,"The book is great, BUT the Kindle version pagination is all wrong, and the TOC doesn't list page numbers. As I've gone through the course and been instructed to read page 140-160 for example, I have no idea what that translates to in the KINDLE version. Other texts I've received via KINDLE have the same Kindle pagination as the real text so quoting and finding the pertinent reading assingment was a breeze. This is a very big disappointment. To use as a reference tool later, the Kindle version will be fine, but it doesn't work great if utilizing it in a classroom setting."
3,"Good book, but make sure you get the CD","This book should have a CD in it. Mine did not, and I did not know to ask for it."
5,a reference for future ISD project,I bought a previous version for an Intro to ISD class. Have come back to this book repeatedly as a reference and way to help get through various phases of ADDIE. One of the few textbooks that will get used repeatedly over the years.
4,Good for the basics,"Overall, I feel this book was written well. Most books related to instructional design are dense with jargon and fluff. This book cuts straight to the point. It really provides the reader with a crash course in instructional design. I would recommend this job to individuals who are new to instructional design or want a refresh on the basics. Its a quick read and easy to understand.One aspect of the book that I did not like was its coverage of Quality Control. To me, i found the quality control method to be subjective and not useful as an instructional designer. Instead of using these wordy acronyms, I would have like to see Hodell emphasize the kirkpatrick model and the benefits of using it. I understand that kirkpatrick is more useful after a course is developed but it is also the most crucial components when revising a course.I enjoyed the book though and found it to be an easy read."
5,Role playing,"The supervisor script book is the real time role playing that every new supervisor should try at least once. These workshop allows you to test the water and get your feet wet, and examine the results."
1,"Way too wordy, very little about Capone","I quit reading this book at page 110 because it's just too wordy, filled with useless information and not much on Capone. Do we really need the address of every place he mentions, or a description of each person's clothing? The author spends so much time on Chicago political figures, and quotes that I find difficult to believe are factual, mainly because they're so obscure. I mean, really, how does someone's research come up with so much useless information?I guess I'm the only one that doesn't like this book. If you're looking for a book about Capone, look elsewhere. If you enjoy reading page after page of useless information with a million names (and each name goes into great detail about the person for no apparent reason), then this book is for you. My reading time is limited; I can't waste any more time on this book."
3,Weak Condition,"The product delivered was the book that I ordered. However, when the book about CAPONE arrived it was in worse condition than described. The edges were curled up and the color was faded. I believe the book was advertised as ""like new."" It certainly didn't appear ""like new."""
3,A thorough account.,A very well done and entertaining report on one of the US most notorious personalities. Fascinating account of the inner workings of corruption in early 1900s Chicago. Blurred is the line between the good guys and the bad guys.
4,A great set of remixes for devoted Funker Vogt/VAC fans,"Remix Wars Volume 4 will be best appreciated by those who are devoted Funker Vogt and Velvet Acid Christ fans. Without hearing the original songs first, one may think of this as just another mediocre industrial grind-fest. So by itself, it probably won't impress too many people...but I definetly recommend it to long-time fans of Funker Vogt and Velvet Acid Christ. My only gripe is that I think maybe they should have put a few more songs on here to make it a full album."
5,Great Remix CD,"I am a big fan of VAC, so this cd was a must have for me. funkervogt i think is alright.. their good but to me all those germman electronic groups all sound the same... (kmfdm, rammstein, etc..) anyway though this cd puts two great EBM artists together and makes eachothers songs sound even better."
1,Crappity crap!,"Usually when you want a remix done, you try to get a band that's BETTER than yours, but I guess a GOOD band wouldn't touch VAC. Funker Vogt is a bit better than VAC, but only in the way that a punch in the eye is better than a kick in the ....These bands have the worst most insipid lyrics in the genre... and that's saying something. The music is the same repetative dancefloor EBM we hear all too often.Take a clue from previous band who've done rmx wars (like haujobb) change your sound!"
5,$100......WOW,You can not beat this guitar for $100. What a great product for my son to learn on. Nice finish. Will change strings out but that's about it. Good sound and in tune all the way up the neck.
1,Very disappointed,"The guitar is given to my granddaughter as a giftIt looks very nice and she was very enthusiastic tic to get started to learn how to playBut when we start to tune it the fender from the ""E"" broke.The metal cracked.My husband is a guitar player for many years and his oldest guitar is almost 40 years old and cost him 16 rubles!And this $100 red wood crap did not last even the 1st tuningWhat is the quality!?To replace the fender you have to buy the set worth $78.Better not to try it.."
4,Not bad.,"Great learner guitar. Action is a little high, and needed new strings. However, its not bad for the price especially when you are just starting.I would recommend having it professionally setup, and changing the saddle to bone or another material."
3,decent guitar for the price,"just got this guitar in today, upon initial inspection the guitar had no problems from shipping. Ever heard the saying ""you get what you pay for"", applies here. Definitly not a bad guitar for 100 bucks though, I bought this guitar to kick around at campfires and something I wouldn't have to worry about to much if it was broken. The action on this Epiphone is really high so I would suggest filing down the bridge on it, also the strings that come with it are cheap, I have already ordered a new set. Obviously it's not a $500-$1,000 guitar so you will notice upon close inspection that the fit and finish is not perfect but like I stated before it will def work for my purposes. With a little bit of work I'm sure it will play much easier. Not a bad set up for a beginner or someone looking a low cost guitar to kick around with. Contrary to other reviews, This guitar does have a Truss Rod, located in the hole of the guitar."
2,"Great design, fragile triggers","I've had two of these Mad Catz controllers - they intially seem superior to the standard dreamcast controller, because they are ergonomically better designed. Unfortunately, the trigger design is poor, and both units have broken right triggers - probably from giving little extra oomph on the gas during driving games. I wish that it wasn't true, because otherwise it is the most comfortable controller available."
5,love these bars!,these bars make a great snack for adults as well as children. I love all the flavors that are offered.
2,Stale,"When I finally ate one, it was stale!! I would never buy these through this online vendor again."
4,not just for kids,"Nutrition bars for adults are often horrible tasting, so I'm pleased with the graham bars from Clif. No chemical taste or aftertaste! Slightly sweet and the perfect size for a quick snack! Actually, all their kid products are pretty good. Not such a fan of the adult products!"
2,threw them away,"Was excited to get such a big box, but when I opened them, more than half were not wrapped and the ones that were wrapped were smooshed...ended up throwing all away because it would have cost more to ship them back. The main company I called didn't even seem to care. :("
2,These are disgusting!!!,"I was so excited to order these! They had great reviews and I thought I finally found something I could have with me the kids could eat that was not a junky snack that wasn't good for them. What a waste of money! My kids took one bite and didn't like it. I got them to try another bite and they had to spit it out. I thought the bars couldn't be that bad so I decided to open one and try it myself.. EWWW! No wonder my kids wouldn't eat them!!They are dry and taste like cardboard and anything resembling a chocolate chip certainly isn't because there isn't a bit of chocolatey flavor in them!! I spit it out also. Just to be sure it wasn't me, I had a friend try it to and her reaction was the same.. ""you aren't giving these to your kids are you?"" Well, I intended to but knowing what I know about how they taste.. NO WAY! Buy something else!!!!"
4,unsealed paks more frequent :(,"My son loves these bars; even though he's now a teen he prefers them over regular cliff bars, he says they're softer & sweeter & less dehydrating.The problem is that more & more of my subscribe & save products are arriving with one or more of the individual packages unsealed. My only recourse is to repack the entire order and return it. . . By a certain date."
5,Tasty and comes bi-monthly,"I found that these are a granola bar I enjoy. The price, when ordered as part of the subscription, is decent. I have them set up to come every two months. I find this makes them a treat, without having them always be in the pantry. Chocolate taste while also containing some other ingredients that might not be half bad for me. And even though they are for kids, they are a good treat for adults too."
2,"Poor quality, and scratched on first use","Farberware is by far the worst brand I used, scratched on first use. I will never buy them again as I do not want to eat chemicals. Be aware of the bait of cheap price!"
5,Best Skillets I've used thus far,"They work very well for me. They seem to cooki evenly and clean up easily. The 12 inch one is large enough to make big skillet meals or pancakes. The only thing I don't like is the red but with the deal I got. the color isn't all that important. I hope they hold up well but only time will tell that,"
3,Kindof cheap!,"I bought some other farberware pans that were really heavy duty and nice, (plus cheaper)! I recieved these and was a little disappointed. These are really light weight seem like a cheaper quality. Cook good though."
4,Great for the price,I haven't owned these pans long so I can't say how the Teflon will stand up but for now they have a great no-stick surface and are easy to clean. The pans are lightweight but sturdy and the deep sides make them good for just about anything.
3,"Love the depth of the pans, but the paint SUCKS!","I loved the pans when they came in! But, I soon found out the the paint/stain (whatever) they used on the outside of the pans, is AWFUL!!!! wHEN THE PANS GET HOT, YOU CANNOT WIPE OFF ANY OILS, SAUCES, ETC, AS THE TOWELS WILL STICK AND MAKE THE STAIN PERMANENT!!! I had my pans for maybe 2-3 weeks, (and I cook 2 meals a day), and they look awful! The inside of the pans is in top condition, as I wash them by hand (they are not dishwasher safe), but I wish the outside was more durable."
