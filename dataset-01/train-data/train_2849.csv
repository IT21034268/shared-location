3,Doctors Can't Save Everyone,"I would probably love this game if I could advance any farther in it. I know it's a game, but honestly, sometimes people die. If a person suddenly has a million and one aneurisms at the surgical site, they most likely would have a million and one aneurisms other places in their body. I would prefer to have an occasional mundane surgery so that I won't get fired if one patient dies. If you aren't an experienced, hard-core gamer, don't buy the game. It's impossible for any human (or, any human I've met) to complete."
3,This Game Is Frustrating,I love the idea behind this game and it's pretty impressively exectuted. I had three gripes though: 1) It's so fast paced that I found it really difficult to progress past the third procedure. 2)I couldn't get the magnify and reduce (with quick little circles) to work. This caused me great frustration. 3)There's no way to skip through the seemingly endless pages of character dialogue if you have to repeat a procedure a couple of times.I quit playing it pretty quickly.
2,Limited Game,"Though Trauma Center is an interesting game for the DS, I would not reccomend you purchase it when there are so many other games that are more involved.Trauma Center involves you being a surgeon. You perform different surgeries on people.The game falls short in many areas. For one, I found the difficulty to be a little too high. This is because you might not figure out which tool to use exactly until it's too late. Even then, sometimes the characters will talk at the top of the screen and say things moments before you need to do them. You have the special power to slow down time when you are performing. Sometimes they will just screwm out to you to use this power, and if you don't your patient dies within seconds.Another thing, sometimes the game becomes more tedious than fun. Even if you know what to do, it can be annoying to have to do the same 6 steps over and over.I would reccomend that you buy Animal Crossing if you are looking for different."
3,Fun for a while but it gets old,I recommend getting this game used. Its really one of those games that you play once but never again.The game design is quite unique but I found it almost impossible to get above a 'C' in the operations. The story is a bit too flat and predictable.
2,New to DS and games in general.,"I recently purchased a DS and this was the fourth game I bought. I wish I would have saved my money or purchased a different game. The characters are annoying and even though I perform the ""so called skills"" as they instruct you to, I can't seem to get past certain procedures (which adds to my frustration). Bottom line, unless you like to be annoyed - SAVE YOUR MONEY."
4,Definately a new twist on gaming,"I've heard so much about this game and found it so interesting that I just had to get it. Searched high and low for it for so long and never found it. Finally I took my baby cousin to toys r us the other day and decided to look at the video games to see if the had it. Not only did they have it, but it was the last one too. WOOHOO!Now....to actually talk about my review. Really is an awesome game. Even my mom likes it. The only flaw is that it's very difficult (reason for the 4 star rating). Seemes like you can't take your eyes away from the game without your patient slipping away. It's taken several tries but I'm finally getting the hang of it.I've been hearing that some stores are banned from selling this game or just discontinued it. Anyone know if that's true?"
2,Did not Fit,I could not get these shoes on my foot. The top of the shoe comes too far back on the foot. Bought the Florsheim Jesse's and they fit great!
4,The last book..............................................,"~The Book was good.Not the best in all but good.Though the ending waz stupid and messed up the book some.Morgan could not alwayz wanted to be a powerful witch cuz she didnt alwayz know she waz a witch.I do realy realy like the series and i hope this is not tha last book.For i think if it is ,it is a bad conclusion to this well wrote series.I hope that this is not the final book to SwEeP."
3,Not the best,"Ok, so it wasn't the best book. I thought it deserved some points for being in the series itself. To tell the truth, after Cal and Selene are defeated, the series kind of lost it's purpose. Actually, i think the best part of this book was the cover. The cover looks awesome! Anyways, i waited forever to get the book, but it did NOT live up to my expectations. I'd still read it, but it's not amazing."
5,The Conclusion To The Sweep Series Is Here With Full Circle,"In Full Circle, the unfortunate end to the Sweep series, Morgan and Hunter share the narration. Hunter decides to quit the council and then tries to decide what to do with his life. Morgan starts to have these dreams with Cal in them and she realizes that someone is trying to kill her through the dreams. Is it Cal or someone else?This was a great conclusion to the Sweep series. Although due to recent sales increase the publishers of Sweep are coming out with a Super Edition. The tentative release date for it is August 2003. Can't wait!"
4,sweep series,"This one did a good job of rounding out the plot and morgan and hunter finally get the quality time together they have been wanting but, like the rest of the series it's frustratingly short book and a cliffhanger to boot so looks like we'll have to see what's in store for our witches while they're overseas in the next volume!"
1,Broke after 2 weeks,This battery was super cheap so I bought it for my watch. The battery died after only 2 weeks. The seller told me to ship it back but that would have cost more than the price of the battery. Beware of cheap batteries as they are probably expired or about to. I did not save the packaging to check.
5,Excellent...,"It's a long, long story how I ended up searching for this opera. Suffice it to say I do not enjoy opera as a rule, but my wife loves classical music and so does our five-year-old granddaughter. My wife has never indicated she really enjoyed opera that much.She always associated Purcell with instrumental music and was unaware of this piece.We all love it. I play it all the time. The witches are particularly fun to listen to. Highly recommend. And this comes from someone who loves country western, Willie Nelson, Traveling Wilburys, Roy Orbison, and Queen. etc."
4,"The Loeb Classical Library volumes are unbeatable for quality, perspective, & classical information at a reasonable price","The Loeb Classics series is wonderful--I have by now perhaps 20 volumes of the Loeb Greek and Roman classics. The Historia Augusta includes 6 vols. of often factual information, although the series also demonstrates how credulous were our ancestors before modern means of getting reliable information (think of our ease of getting info on the recent Russian meteor streaking across the sky, for example). It's great to be able to review the thought and experience of thinkers, writers, and observers millennia ago. If you have an interest in this direction, try a Loeb Classics volume or two--I have by now perhaps 20 volumes or so of the Loeb Greek and Roman classics."
2,Call Waiting.,This book is about a girl named Karen and she likes a boy Ethen as well. She loves him so much she will do anything not to let him go. I liked this book because it shows how much Boyfriends and Girlfriends care about each other.
2,The Death Book,Call Waiting is about a girl named Karen. Karen has a boyfriend named Ethan. Ethan wanted to break up with Karen. Then Karen started getting phone calls that said that someone she knows is going to cut her thoat and kill her. Every time Ethan is on the phone with Karen the person always calls. I do not like how the writer R.L Stine makes it look like it is one person but then it isn't. Karen got so crazy over one boy that she went crazy. You would not like this book if you do not like twists and turns. You would not like this book if you do not like mysteries. That is what Call Waiting is about.
2,Call Waiting,Call Waiting was an ok book. It is about a a girl named Karen who has a boyfriend that likes anither girl named Wendy. Karen does not like the fact that Ethan(her boyfriend) is doing this to her. Then Karen gets these frighting phone calls from a person with a raspy voice. The person says that he is going to kill her. What should Karen do? Will she die? If you like not a lot of action but plenty of suspense this book is for you. If you don't like books that lead you in the wrong direction I suggest you don't waste your time.
3,call waiting,"Keren a 16 year old girl with many difficulties in her hard life. She has a boyfriend, Ethan. Keren is a highschool girl who is unsure about hers and Ethans relationship.Keren starts to get weird phone calls.When she finally found out who the caller was, and confronted them. In the book I would change one person,Keren. She is to paranoied for me.Iwould recomend this book to people who are interested in mysterey. I would also recomend this book to young women beacause this book will help them in future realationships. I would also recomend this book to young men because it will also help them learn how to treat girls."
4,Call Waiting,"I read the book ""Call Waiting,"" by R.L. Stine. I enjoyed this book because I've always enjoyed mysteries, where you have a lot of climaxes and you always end up having to guess who the suspect is. I liked how the author did a good job of disguising the suspect, so that you would had never have guessed. I also really liked the suspense that left you wondering at the end of each chapter.I thought the best part of the book was the end. R.L. Stine did a good job of making it seem like the suspect was going to kill the main character, until a twist brought her boyfriend to her rescue. It had an excellent ending.I thought the author did a good job of describing the characters. With such vivid descriptions I could picture what each of the characters looked liked. The book also had very explicit climaxes, usually at the end of each chapter. It kept me wondering and made me want to read on."
3,dissapointing,"the story is basically about a girl who is kind of obsessed with her boyfriend and is afraid he will leave her for someone else, then she gets threatening phone calls......this is basically what the story is about. I find RL stine a very good suspense writer but this story was one big dissapointment for me. The story seemed to be written for little children (younger then goosebumps) and the caller(s) was SSSSOOOOO obvious. This is the first time I was bored and dissapointed by reading an RL Stine book. If you want to read good Rl Stine stories read the horror trilogy (99 fear street)."
3,A stalker that likes to call before dropping IN!!!!!,"First it was to make her boyfriend come over, but then he breaks up with her. She needs away too get them back together. So she pretends to have call waiting ,and every time she has a fake call when she is on the phone with him, he'll rush to her side. But when he finds out the truth he stops coming over. But her call waiting scheme comes true and nobody want's to help!!!"
4,It was mysterious.,"I really like these kinda books and have nearly read them all. My favorite one is The Hidden Evil, but I also like this one as well!"
1,DON'T PICK UP THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!,"this is one of the worst books i have ever read!! it seems that all of stine's criminals turn out to be the best friend!!!! i do not recommend this book, and to think, i own it!!!!"
1,Call waiting,I didn't really like this book. The reason why I don't this book is because I thought that it was stupid and there also was WAY TOO MUCH DRAMA! Also I thought they people were so fake and lame and thats why I didn't like this book. Bye have a nice day =]
1,TERRIBLE BOOK,"I did not like the book Call Waiting because it was not enough bloody murder. The plot was really not for male teens. A lot of the stuff Karen, main character, does is so weird. I didn't like when you had to keeping on reading until you understand the book. Some of the parts in the book were so weird.I recommend this book to many female teens who like mystery books. I also recommend it to all readers who like reading mystery books because this book has a very good ending that any reader could not guess."
3,Call Waiting,"This story is about a girl n amed Karen and a guy named Ethan. Everytime Karen is talking on the phone, she says she has a call waiting and then later on she goes back to the other line and is panicking. She starts worrying and so does Ethan because she mostly puts him on hold.In this book, Karen sometimes gets calls at school from the mysterious person who keeps on calling her whenever she's talking on the phone to Ethan. Some people make fun of her too.My opinion on this book was that it was pretty interesting yet it was sort of boring. That's why I only gave it three stars. Ok, that's all."
3,It was a boring mistory.,"This book was about a young highschool girl ,who gets prank phone calls, which scare her. whenever she gets a prank, it's either on a phone thats disconnected, or it clicks into her non-call waiting line. at first she thinks it's her boyfriend playing a joke on her, or her best friends who shes in a fight with but then she starts to get the phone calls at school."
1,Bad Book,It was crap.This book was so bad.It had no massive brutal murder.It was about a girl who was so desperate to keep her boyfreind that she made up murder threats.Then the threats were real.Then someone tried to kill her but they didn't so it was crap.I would't reccomend this book to anyone who likes massive brutal murder becasue there is none.
1,Doesnt work,"This aftermarket battery is not compatible with my inspiron 9300.A waste of money. Go buy the official Dell battery. It costs more, but at least it works."
1,It didn't work,"Although the information said it was for my lap top, the battery did not fit and has to be returned."
5,Must reading for any baseball fan!,"This book provides a lot of unorthodox but well-reasoned insights into the game of baseball. Baseball writers and commentators tend to bombard us with meaningless statistics. Torrez shows how to get real value from just a few well-chosen stats. At the same time, his book is always amusing and fun to read."
3,A quick read baseball primer.,"Mr. Torrez has done a decent job of hammering the baseball establishment. Many of his insights however have been done before, and done better, by the likes of Bill James, Don Malcolm, John Thorn, etc. Some of Mr. Torrez' credibility is hurt by factual errors, like his insistence that Larry Andersen was a left hander relief pitcher."
3,Not really satisfied.,"As an air filter it works. I placed this in my 2010 Rav4 as I was looking for a little better performance when hauling a small trailer. I noticed that with this filter (on two tanks of gas) my city mpg went from 20-21 mpg down to 18-19 mpg. Placed the Toyota airfilter back in the vehicle and I am back to 20-21 mpg again. On the hwy I was getting 1 mpg less with this filter. I normally get 26-27 and with this I am getting 25. There is no difference in mileage when pulling my trailer from my past results. I also notice no difference at all in performance of the vehicle. For the price of this filter, even with it being a lifetime filter, I would expect at least the same performance as the stock Toyota filter."
1,Peeler,"Was mailed mailed a left handed peeler instead of the right handed i ordert,after washing it it started rosting the next day.I can not recomend this company.no contact e-mail or phone either, so i'm stuck with it, I guess!"
5,The only camera you will ever need,"I purchased this when it first became available a few years ago and loved it. I sold it a few months ago because I had convinced myself that it was more then I needed. After trying a 30D and a 5D, I sold them both and purchased another 1DS MARK II. When you own the best, you just can't settle for anything else. The absolute only feature I wish this had is the sensor shake to remove dust like the new models have. Other then that, this is the perfect digital camera. Do yourself a favor and use a high quality lens with it. The best deserves the best."
1,This is a Waste,"Don't get this over the door hanger. At first, it was great that it adjusts, however it never stops adjusting...The product ends up falling all over the place because it isn't stable. Don't waste your money."
5,GREAT,"It's a life saver does just what they said it would. I wear size seven ring, but it was for my thumb so I went up two size's. I can work again and not drop stuff.Thanks alot"
4,Order one size bigger,Good and sturdy product. I would recommend anybody buying this to order one size bigger. I originally ordered a 9 but it is a perfect fit. The fact that it is long it became too tight in certain places. I returned it for the next size up and it is perfect. Return process was simple but I had to pay for the shipping cost to return which was a down side. I would recommend this product if you are using it to support a trigger finger.
2,If you have small hands beware....,"I thought the idea of these was very clever. I wanted to immobilize my ring finger because it was popping, due to a stress injury and I wanted to give it a chance to get better. I had been taping it but I have to wash my hands a lot and the tape would get gross after a while. I was so exited to try this.I got a size 6 and seemed to fit on my finger, sort of it wasn't super tight but it wasn't falling off either. It didn't keep my finger from bending at all, I might as well have been wearing a plastic ring. I tried turning it sideways and upside down but that didn't seem to work right either.Anyway some people seem happy with it so perhaps it works on some hand sizes but if you have small hands, ring 3-6 sizes I would probably not bother with these."
2,"Ok, product. Sizing is a challenge","This product was recommended to me for a damaged finger. The product was adequately described and shipped on time. Despite a fair amount of time spent trying to figure out what size to order, the product only sort of fits and attempts to make adjustments were only modestly successful. I suspect that if you are like enough to have a ""standard-sized"" finger, standard sized products will work but for those who don't, you might not wish to waste your money on something that only ""sort-of"" works. I doubt that I'll wear this device much. Fortunately, it was fairly inexpensive."
1,Artsy-Fartsy Crap,"The title of this review says it all. The dvd tells how an architect (artist) proposes to decorate the plaza of the Boston city hall with a garden area based on the inspiration of Ma's performance of Bach's music for unaccompanied cello. So what I got was pictures of the proposal, narration (bla-bla-bla) with background of Ma's playing and also episodes of him playing out in the boondocks. I'll bet Ma wishes he'd never got roped into this piece of nonsense. I'll stick to listening and creating my own images, thank you!"
1,A real disappointment,"I returned this book, after browsing through it for about an hour. For $80, I expected an excellent work of scholarship, filled with good illustrations, descriptions and analyses of various weapons, schools and styles, etc. Instead, this book is a thin rehash of existing scholarship, with a few, weak illustrations and very little insight into anything having to do with the sword. There is very little description of technique of Western sport fencing, much less of more esoteric or historical styles. The section on saber fencing is appalling. Weapons are catalogued, but there are few illustrations, none in color, and no discussion of how the design of a particular weapon determined the style of fencing associated with it"
5,A GREAT REFERENCE BOOK!,"I find myself using ""The Encyclopedia of the Sword"" all the time. That's probably the mark of a useful reference book, huh? The encyclopedia covers swords from all over the world, movies, art, literature, sport, history, sword fighting techniques, biographies. Sometimes it's just fun to sit down and read it. I recommend ""The Encyclopedia of the Sword"" to everyone."
3,As You Like it or Much Ado About Nothing ?,"We spent considerable time with this book at the library reference section (it was just way too expensive to purchase). While we were at first incredibly impressed at the amount of material covered, it soon became clear it was all rehashed from secondary and third-hand sources and contained nothing really new. The more we dug the clearer the theme of sport and movie swordplay showed through. Not much on historical methods and sources of swords as true weapons. This encyclopedia offers a lot for those who don't have access to many references, but there was just so much that misconstrued knightly swordplay of the middle ages and there was also very little on important early renaissance fencing. I realize a lot probably had to be left out for space, but its hard to rave about an incomplete encyclopedia that misleads."
1,Not a book if you're actually interested in swords,"Despite the title, if you're actual interest is in SWORDS, not fencing or stage play or using swords, but actually the swords themselves, then this is absolutely NOT the book to get."
2,Encyclopedia? Hardly!,I wasn't aware the only swords that existed and were noteworthy enough to grace the pages of an Encyclopedia were European. Seems to me much is left out by ignoring the Eastern blades.
3,CLELIO DIIRKES DE OLIVEIRA/MARAVILHOSO CD,PARA QUEM GOSTA DE UMA BOA MUSICA (SALSA) ESSE É UM SENHOR CD EM QUALIDADE COM AS MUSICA.
4,FABLED LANDS 1-6,"THESE BOOKS ARE A BRIGHT AND DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT WAY OF DOING THE OLD CHOOSE YOUR OWN ADVENTURE GENRE ALLOWING YOU TO FOLLOW A NON LINEAR PATH AND TO HAVE AS MUCH FREEDOM AS IS POSSIBLE IN FANTASY RPG GAME BOOK. BUT, AND THIS IS A BIG BUT WHERE ARE ISSUES 7-12? COME ON DAVE MORRIS AND JAMIE THOMSON WHERE ARE THEY?"
4,"Quite interesting, but what happened to books 7-12?","The books were very interesting but got repeatitive after going back and forth. I am still waiting for the books 7-12, which were supposed to come out late in 1996! All the six books I have are exciting at most times."
5,Not What I thought,"I honestly thought I was ordering a full copy of the official book of kells. Perhaps I didn't read thoroughly enough. But the quality of this journal/notebook is absolutely wonderful. I tell you, if you are a journaler, or a poet, or song writer, then there is no better page to enter your work into."
5,"Beautiful, and usable, journals","I have a few different Paperblank journals and all are very well made. I had to read the description a couple of times to make sure I was purchasing the journals with lined paper. The paper itself takes ink well.Some of the journals have pockets on the inside flap and all seem to lie flat when open for easy writing. The Book of Kells series is amazing. I find something new each time I look at the cover. Basically, I'm a sucker for pretty journals."
5,My first chapter book,"I ordered this book because it was the first chapter book I read as a child. I read this book in the 4th grade and remember my surprise that I could actually read a ""really long book."" As all reading teachers know a child's first chapter book is a milestone is literacy development. I am now a reading teacher and in my 50's. It was good to find this book."
5,Touching,"I felt as if I was being touched by an angel, as I read through the chapters of this story. This book flows with emotions that are real to everyday struggles and thoughts women continue to go through; so many unfulfilled dreams. Great job Maxine Thompson, in making it so real to life. A piece of my heart is with all the Jewel's of the world."
5,"A novel of family, heritage, and the enduring human spirit.","When Imani Shepherd, a world-traveled African-American journalist, tries to find out about her family tree through interviewing her elderly parents on video, she runs into a network of half-truths, evasions, and shame. She finds her family consumed with keeping ""dirty little secrets"". Because of her mother's denial, the family history is shrouded and elusive, epitomizing a pattern of Black mothers and their daughters down through generations marked by a collective memory of slave experiences, rapes and brutalities. The Ebony Tree is a candid, unflinching, revealing, and ultimately redeeming novel of family, heritage, new generations, and the enduring human spirit framed within African-American experience and personal history."
5,An excellent reading experience!,"Maxine has done a remarkable job with this work. The Ebony Tree deals with relationships between mothers and daughters. Though I could feel the pain of the characters, the story was filled with historical points. It was so real, it was like reading an old newspaper, and recounting events from my own family's past."
5,Very Entertaining! Very Informative!,"The Ebony Tree reminded me of how I grew up in Arkansas. It made me think of how different generations of Black women have continued on, in spite of...It made me think of my mother, who is 93."
2,windy circular rub raw,"To be fair, I have only read up to chapter six. The book does pound home several pointsbut the writing is dry and goes on tangents. I want to understand criminal procedure. Ido not want to bathe myself with the nuances of side arguments of the 4th amendments. Iwould rather leave this to the teacher to present or a horn book. Moreover, the authorfeels the need to restate his point several times and in as many ways as possible. Itappears as if the author is getting paid by the word. To demonstrate this point, the bookis over 30 chapters and more than 700 pages.I don't have another sugestion; however, I used Black Letter Series for Criminal Law andfound it very helpful."
5,Jess Franco Classic Finally available!!!,Howard Vernon stars in this classic Jess Franco film about a man who inherits his family's sadistic habits. This disc contains the often missing dungeon/torture sequence that is a real eye opener. The widescreen transfer is perfect and this is in french with english subtitles. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for Franco fans and horror fans in general.
4,It is useless to resist...,"Definitly a highlight in the Episode III toyline, this figure of the sinister Supreme Chancellor Palpatine comes straight from the scene where Jedi master Mace Windu and his fellow companions try to arrest him -- with no success, as the cloaked Sith lord is not easily matched.The figure of Palpatine in an excellent likness of actor Ian McDiarmid comes with an additional head and set of hands, as well as with blue lightning bolts, so that the figure can be transformed from politician to gruelsome Sith warlord."
4,okay,"this is a semi-cool Palpatine.I have all the palpatines(the emperor one,the prisoner one and this one).This one is cool,but not as cool as th emperor one.I was lucky enough to find the red lightsaber variant.I reccomend this to any star wars fan but dont listen to me."
3,An OK figure...,Palpatine is not all that exciting but he does the job. There is something to keep in consideration though: He has two variants. One of them has a correct red lightsaber and the other has blue. Push down on his head for a semi-lame slashing attack.
1,$100...Ouch!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Is it just me, or does $100 for an Episode 3 Star Wars figure sound absurd? Is this a hard to find figure? Seems pretty ridiculous.Anybody else also think Amazon's action figure selection has become craptastic since TRU left? All we have now is high priced specialty stores. What a shame."
3,The Dark LorD PALPATINE,"It's a SAD DAY PEopleZ....BEwaRE Before you decide to order any ROTS Figures From TRUS/AMAZON.I BOUGHT 4 PALPATINES,1st of all The picture of the palpatine TRus uses have a blue lightSaber . i ordered 4, i got all red lightsabers and iam not happy at all! 2nd too add insult too injury my figures was packed very poorly! i mean 2 was smashed together side by side while the other 2 was decent! and left more in a packable position! i think i will buy from premium sellers like ebay and Toymaniacs! for my collection! or just hit the stores because i can pay less for these then get them for a $1 more each online and all receive them all destroyed by the AMAZON PACKERS! i rate this experience a 9 ------ (10 being worst!)"
1,PALPATINE RULES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"THIS FIGURE IS SO COOL!!!!! I LOVE GETTING OUT MY MACE WINDU, AGEN KOLOR, SIEASETIN, AND KIT FISTO ACTION FIGURES AND RECREATE THE SCENE FROM STARWARS EPISODE 3 REVENGE OF THE SITH. BUY THIS FIGURE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! PALPATINE RULES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Pasta Book,"I like this book because it provides basic instructions for various delicious pasta dishes. I have been able to prepare dinners that taste as good or better than dinners I've had from great restaurants in NYC. The required ingredients are not complicated, but the combination and method of preparing the dishes makes all the difference. I need dishes which can be prepared fairly quickly and these recipes make that possible (unless of course you want to make your own actual pasta noodles!).Buon appetito!"
3,OK,Not the best thing I have ever eaten but not the worse. I personaly would not buy again but they were OK.
5,Works well,"Works great--great grip, lightweight. Using it under diaper changing pad to protect furniture and prevent it from moving and it works well."
1,Ugggghhhh~!!!!,"I'm not going to even go into how much this game sucks. Just listen to all the reviewers before (and after me) who wrote negative comments and opinions about the game because they are absolutely 100% right. I only played it for 1 hour, and it was the only time in my life that I ever felt that 1 hour out of my life was truly wasted. Glad I kept the receipt and got my $16 dollars back when I returned it to the store the same day I bought it. Whew!"
1,"Heavily flawed, and it didn't need to be....","I agree with the flaws the previous reviewer has pointed out they destroy any enjoyment the game might offer. It's so frustrating that ATLUS has done this, because it could have been a great game. The artwork is beautiful, but the fighting menu beeps and technical flaws render it flawed.Atlus has really gone downhill lately, a sthey insist on putting horrible irritations in their latest games. Their sales will continue to suffer if they do this."
2,Took awile to get into it just to get let down.,"I had to restart this game twice. the first time it just had trouble holding my interest. While I really liked the characters, I could read what was going to happen and nothing was very enjoyable. I also HATE games where a Main character dies that had you invested into the story to begin with. I felt that after all the game play spent the ending was a real let down. Did not match the story you watched unfold in my opinion. While the background story was great, they lost it 3/4 through.The fighting style was new and I did enjoy getting into the groove of it. Problem was I didn't even know what Counter Mode was until the end of the game and by then it was difficult to get the flow when I needed it NOW. This could have been a great game but too many different flaws were found that brought it dowm."
2,big disappointment,"While the big-breasted women didn't offend me, it didn't excite me either. I still found the game to be a rather big disappointment.Having only one character fight at a time was a big disaster. It makes the game feel old and unappealing.Many times the enemies appear to be hidden when you're inside a dungeon. I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong. The run button practically doesn't exist because the second you run, an enemy will find and kill you.You might want to look for another RPG because this one didn't work for me."
5,Great game,"I purchased this game as a gift for my boyfriend, and he loves it. The game is just beautiful to look at and set up very well. Amazing game! :D"
1,ultimate worst game experience!!,The game developer of this game have no common sense whatsoever and should not be allowed to create another game. Do not waste your money!!
3,I wanted to love it... really i did...,"But I can't seem to play this game without being extremely alert and sitting up *just* right. The battle system has this timing element to it that nearly incapacitates me if i'm not really ""on"" when i'm playing. So if your an idiot savant when it comes to hitting the right button at the exact right time, maybe this game is for you. Alas, it is not for me. But it is VERY pretty."
2,ugh,"ive heard the battle system was innovative. ok lets get one thing straight. for something to be innovative in an rpg it both has to be new and adds to the gameplay. Magna Carta's needlessly complicated battle system doesnt add to the game it makes it tedious. If you can stomach through it i give you all props. Dull soundtrack, bad voice overs, and the half assed FFX wannabe visuals. The one shining moment is probablly the team interaction is interesting curve....even though its nothing new (that dates back to Vanguard Bandits)"
1,A rip off,"These booklets can be bought at JJ Kellers (in quantity), for around $3.00 apeice. The price here is $30.00??!! Something smells funny...."
2,Disappointed,"With an exception for the song for which I bought this CD (""Another suitcase..."") there was not much else over which to get excited. ALW is one of the best song writers and Clayderman's interpretations were bland offerings at best of those beautiful pieces."
3,A real Jam,"In this Album you will hear Ricardo Ray and his talented orchestra Jammin Live. From this album I specially like three songs: La Zafra (the principal hit of this album), La Cosita (with Bobby Cruz and Miki Vimari singing) and Gloria a Dios (an special latin version of Let it Be, from ""The Beatles""). This album was recorded Live in New York. With it, Ricardo Ray demonstrated that he is a virtuoso pianist in and out of the music studio."
3,It just is.,"This album is a live jam, as the title suggests, that really isn't really bad. The downside is that is isn't really good either. ""Descarga del Bajo"" is pretty good and the best track is obviously ""La Zafra"" which is the first recording of this track that I am aware of (someone please correct me if I'm wrong.) ""La Zafra"" starts off interestingly with a Vocal Sampling type of music with the instrumental sounds being done by people instead of actual musical instruments. Really refreshing and clever way to create an intro. The rest of the track has the fiery sound and beautiful lyrics you have come to know from this outstanding song (if you're a Richie Ray & Bobby Cruz fan.)As for the rest, it's just uninspiring and doesn't really merit many words. The best way to sum up the album would be to say that ""it just is."""
3,great music! not so great sound variations!,"The selections and the arrangements are truly excellent. There are some hard to find (on the same CD) pieces and adagios--Spartacus ; Rodrigo's Concierto de Aranjuez; Mascagni's Intermezzo from Cavelleria...But, better turn up the sound and then get away from the speakers. Parts of the selections are played so very softly that, when you turn up the volume to hear them, you will get blasted by those sections that have cresendos, or just plain louder sections. Too bad!Very hard to enjoy in a car--or, even at home. if this problem did not exist, this is a 5 star plus!"
5,Blew my mind....,"This album literally blew my mind. I live in Honolulu and am growing tired of the same crap being played over and over. No one wants to take any risks musically here, except for a few artists and Konu is one of them. I love how he combines the local flavor with deep beats and rhymes. For me, he is the Bone Thugs n Harmony of Hawaii. Inhale some pakalolo and put on some Konu...."
4,Closed-captioned ?,"In contrary to the item description, the received DVD (cover showed the 2005 edition) was NOT closed-captioned, and there was no indication of closed-captioning on the DVD cover or on DVD. So be aware if this feature is important to you."
5,THE SPICE GIRLS RULE!!!!!,I Love This Album . The Spice Girls are The Best But Since they will be Finally Over in 2006 I am going to recommend The Pussycat Dolls as a new thing to look at as a band after the Spice Girls.

5,Diversity of Content,This magazine is an outstanding summary of life in current England with comment on the effect that the EU is having (or trying to have) on traditional life of England. Also there are lots of historical comments and stories of days gone by - much missed - and interesting articles on places and people. All in all an ideal magazine for ex-pats and Anglophiles everywhere.
5,Incredible eye-opener! HIGHLY recommended!,"This is a MUST READ, whether you know anyone with cancer or not. It exposes a great deal of corruption in our United States political system and our American Medical Association, almost to the levels of the Internal Revenue Service (although nothing can reach the levels of corruption of that organization, in my humble opinion)."
2,The world without cancer:,"The contents of this book is not matched with my expectation.I want to get a lot of detailed information about the vit B17, but this book is filled with conspiracy about the FDA.So I was disappionted with this book."
2,giving a bad name to alternative cancer therapies,"I would not recommend this book to anyone seriously in need of information about alternative cancer therapies. As an example of the low quality of the research, the author's use of quotes from tabloids should suffice. The book is filled with the author's paranoid, John-Birch-Society conspiracy theories linking the pharmaceutical industry, the Rockefellers, and the Communist plot to take over the world. The only reason I give it two stars rather than one is that there is actually some worthwhile information in the book; however, finding it is like looking for a needle in a haystack. Not worth the effort.If you really want high-quality, scientific information on alternative cancer therapies, start with Ralph Moss' The Cancer Industry.Good luck!"
1,This bunk is still being believed?,"It has been disproven and BANNED in the US. It used to be available here and too many people died so they took it off the market, and rightly so. They call it Vitamin B17 to avoid the drug laws, it's just avoidance. The only reason it's still around, is cause it's so expensive to treat with and makes the doctors RICH."
3,Lotus Guide Review,"World Without Cancer: The Story of Vitamin B17By G. Edward GriffinISBN 978-0-91298-619-7 (American Media)The first printing was in 1974 and as of 2003 this book has been revised and reprinted 17 times; that alone speaks volumes. This book gets into the nuts and bolts of why the American Medical Association, the FDA, and the American Cancer Society call this information a fraud. I know it's a nice thought to put our trust in government agencies because they are looking out for us but the reality is that is seldom the case. Many of their opinions are based on politics and financial objectives. For the cost a good meal you can buy this book and decide for yourself. I did and it's a deep insight into an aspect of health care that you probably were never aware of. I would have liked to see more documentation but when you're dealing with government agencies I suppose it's difficult to do sometimes, that's why this is a 3 star.Rahasya Poe, Lotus Guide"
4,Great! Must Read!,"Great! I only wish he would not have woven so much of his personal opinions on government into the main discussion of the book. I think this will ""rub"" some people the wrong way and may damage his credibility (whether deserved or not) on the other, more important issues he discusses. Besides that, it is excellent!"
5,g e griffin (BRILLANT),After watching World Without Cancer on Google videos I was convinced to read the book also. And Im glad I did .G E Griffin does a tremendous job explaining the story of B17 and Latrile .I think this book is the most important book I have ever read and will encourage all my friends and family to buy this wonderful book as well.Thanks Mr Griffin your a LEGEND.
5,World Without Cancer: The Story of Vitamin B17,Excellent information more about cancer prevention than cure. In depth reporting on the cancer industry and why the cure is not a high priority for many powerful groups in organized medicine. There is a great deal of money made in the cancer industry.Gives several examples of how groups of people in remote areas do not ever get cancer. Their diet is rich in Vitamin B17. This Vitamin is not recognized by the FDA for political reasons. Vitamins can't be patended. When some of these people leave their homeland and adopt our eating habits they get cancer at the same rate as the rest of us.This is important reading for anyone - it can save their life.They only negative is the extreme detail the author provides.
5,World Without Cancer,This book gives a lot of imformation on the different types of vitamins and where they come from to help with a good diet to be healthy.
1,Missing CD,I paid full price for a book because it was advertised it included a CD. When I got the book it did not contain a the CD.
4,Popeye Hat,"I bought this popeye hat for my grandson, he loves popeye, it fits him great and he loves it."
5,killer!!!!!!!!,this is maybe the best tribute recording of anything ever people!!!!!with the new technology and the soulful jackie mittoo/organ/groove material!!!stunning!!your soul needs this immediatly!!!
4,"Outstanding photo-tour of Diana's ""Royal"" life","This was a hard one to put down. It's full of vivid photographs, organized by various chapters in Princess Diana's life - at least the royal aspect of it. The only reason I gave it 4 (rather than 5) stars was the author of this book (also an ""official"" Royal photographer) didn't have access to shooting photos of Diana in the last (and happier) stages of her life. A more personal side of Diana seems to be lacking from this book. This is no fault of the photographer - it's clearly because Diana was in an unhappy situation.The book's a visual feast and mesmerizing to look at. But if you're yearning for a more literal sense of Diana's humanitarian accomplisments, this is not the title with which to accomplish that quest."
5,Extraordinary tribute in view of the first anniversary!,I just purchased my book last night and was deeply touched with the remarkable photos and touching script. This is by far one of the most treasured pieces of all my Diana collection.
4,Beautiful Portrait Book,"This was a breathtakingly beautiful tribute to the late Diana, Princess of Wales, but I wish there had been more text to go along with the incredible pictures. If you are a serious collector of Diana memorabilia or just a casual fan, this is one book you should own."
5,A COMPREHENSIVE AND EASY TO FOLLOW COOKBOOK,"AN ABSOLUTE MUST IN EVERY KITCHEN, I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ALL. AMATEUR COOKS WOULD APPRECIATE THE CLARITY OF THE RECEPIES AND THE VETERAN CHEFS WOULD USE IT AS A REFERENCE."
2,Desserts use Cool Whip; even vegetable recipes use meat,"I question how traditional the recipes can be since the desserts contain cool whip! Moreover, virtually every single recipe in the Vegetables chapter contains meat (usually lamb or stewing beef). The entire book contains one recipes recommended for vegetarians, and that is a very common one (certainly not remotely unique to Iran, Armenia, or Persia). I'm returning my copy; this was a huge disappointment"
5,Cookbook at its Best,"If you crave your grandmother's cooking and want to try to reproduce those wonderful flavors, then this cookbook is written for you. The old Armenian/Lebanese/Persian recipes that all our grandmothers cooked without any measuring are preserved in this book. Linda Chirinian manages to present even the most complicated recipes with such clarity that I know you will be able to cook any recipe showcased in this book. The pictures are accurate and mouth-watering. This is a cookbook worthy of passing down to your children."
2,Just Awful - Even by My Standards,"If you are looking for an accurate depiction of Soviet Naval Aviation in 1944, its a good movie - until somebody starts an engine. At that point you are magically transformed back to the 30's cinema with cheap airplane models dangling from obvious strings doused with lighter fluid and cheap ship models in the bathtub. Strong evidence that Ed Wood had a Russian twin brother. I half expected Gamara to swoop down and attack the Germans also. Unbelievable for a 1983 movie. Add random stock footage from a B&W newsreel and the effect is complete. When at on the ground and at the base the acting and sets are great, but the plot is incomprehensible. There must be 10 subplots going on involving the characters and their girlfriends, and their moms and kids, etc. I'm sure that some of this is a cultural thing, but honestly folks I did not know what to make of this movie!"
5,Yay!,"Ok, so its really hard at some points. But theres one thing that makes up for it all: MULTIPLAYER! Multiplayer is amazing, especially playing Omaha. goood stuff!"
4,The Last of the Classic Era,"This would be the last season for the classic tv series. There's more of the same with modern day celebrities getting the stone-age treatment (Stoney Curtis, Samantha and Darrin), send-ups of current trends, and even an encounter with the future (Gazoo, the space alien). Its funny to me how some people thought the character of an invisible space alien was too unbelievable for The Flintstones. Really? On a show with talking dinosaurs and civilized cave-men? Anyway, when I watched the show as a kid, I used to love the Gazoo character. I found out later that he was voiced by the talented Harvey Korman who later proved himself even funnier on ""The Carol Burnett Show"". I enjoy all the classic episodes of the Flintstones. After these episodes it was never the same as they became ruined by several Saturday Morning incarnations that were never able to capture the same spirit."
4,The Flintstones 6th Season,"Although it has been years since I have watched the Flintstones I still find the last season, like most series the final season or 2 don't measure up to the first."
1,Warners RIPPED me off..!,"..In my set the fourth disc was from season 4..!..Warners is ALWAYS screwing up..!..Not Me, No More..!.It gets NO STARS..!"
1,Not worth it,"This item was advertised wrong at 68"" or 72"" long. What I received was 58"" long. Too short for any adult that I know of. It also only weighs 3# It is very thin. Definitely not worth the price. I will not purchase from this company again. I gave them a negative review because they didn't offer to pay return shipping for their mistake. They then sent me an e-mail saying that if I removed the negative review that they would send me a shipping label. That is not how the review system is suppose to work. Companies should not bribe you to give them a good review. I will pay the return postage and stick to my guns with the negative review."
1,No manual -- how does it work???,"The product immediately launches you into a series of ""lessons"" which are nothing but TESTS, apparently designed to test the knowledge of someone who already knows beginning Spanish. Of course I've failed 5 in succession because I DON'T KNOW SPANISH! I'm clicking on ""lessons"" in the order that they're presented to me on the interface, and none are actually LESSONS in the sense that they teach me the Spanish language. If they're in here, they're well hidden. For the money I spent, I shouldn't have to go looking for the content."
1,A discombobulated jumble,"Instant Immersion Spanish Deluxe 2.0 was not a structured approach to teaching Spanish. I couldn't make sense of which CD to start with, which one to progress to, how to know when I've completed any particular phase, or even whether there *are* phases to this learning package.The CDs are labeled CD1 through CD8. I started with CD1, ""Talk to Me Beginner Spanish"". I found that repeated visits to the Help text gave me no clue on how to use the program that installed from CD1; the Help Text might as well have been in Spanish!I expect a certain amount of frustration from the act of learning a new language; I don't expect major frustration from trying to figure out how to use the Spanish-teaching programs."
1,Get a better product,"Well, to be fair, I didn't get the version I was offered. This is for the 'Deluxe' version and I received the standard. The standard is pretty horrible, It looks like it was made in the early 90's and needs a significantly improved interface. Also, everything is pronounced with the Castillian lisp, that can get incredibly annoying if you're used to Spanish from Latin America instead. Make sure you're getting a more modern product and that they actually send you the 'Deluxe' version. It's worth it"
2,Good thing it's cheap,"The obvious comparison here is to Rosetta Stone, and you can tell the quality of the products is going to be vastly different because of the prices they can charge. The most obvious flaw I see with this is that there doesn't seem to be any kind of ""lesson"" section. It's more like a series of games, and tests where you are just kind of expected to know what the heck it is you are doing. In Rosetta Stone the picture word association are made and then you have to remember them. Here they just show ya a picture and you have to guess. It's not completely useless, but this product can only really be used to supplement another method of learning the language."
1,Instant Immersion,"Like the title says...I went through the first disk (for begginers) and was instantly thrown to the wolves ie; which word completes this sentence or what sentence describes the pictures seen. For someone who needs to learn from the basics, like me, this program is definatley not for you."
3,instant immersion spnsh deluxe 2.0,"Pleased with product as assistant with other educational tutours for this language, spnsh Deluxe 2.0"
1,Spanish vs. Mexican,"Why the french version shows a map of France and the spanish version doesnt show a map of Spain???How they want us to trust in their software if they are not even able to locate Spain in a map???Of course they speak spanish in Mexico... but is not exactly the same, so we have to spect to be learning spanish from Mexico or from Spain???"
2,To add to other reviews posted on this product...,"This software is not very helpful, but it might teach some vocabulary to patient people. It is not Latin American Spanish, as some reviewer wrote about Version 2.0--it is Spanish from Spain, nevermind that there is a map of Mexico on the cover. The games are actually not very fun, and I did not feel I was immersed. I also agree with the reviewer who wrote that the software was hard to use. The interface is not very intuitive, and the instructions are not clear. I should have put the $40 I spent on this toward buying level 1 of Rosetta Stone, which I have used in the past, and is a high quality language learning program with a simple interface."
2,Installation problems immediately,"It appears to be a relatively standard foreign language program. Difficult to naviagate and requires many tries to become oriented. Spanish-English Dictionary requires a code number for installation, and no matter how many combinations of serial number, proof of purchase, etc., you may try none will work. Have to email maker for solution which interrupts any learning routine. It would seem resonable to offer an easy reference to whatever code is required for installation in an obvious place on the box.Program appears to be very comprehensive. I would prefer more CD-ROM's and fewer Audio CD's. The combination of four of each type disk makes for a confused schedule for learning."
2,Not easy to use,"I am sure they intended a great program but the software is very very difficult to navigate. Once you figure out how to use it, you learn well enough but I would not buy another one in this format. I had used other Instant immersion programs that were much simpler."
3,PC Language study,"this is a good program for PC. no reason to waste time with Rosetta stone. truth be told, learning a new language requires ready, WRITING, listening, repeat drills, etc......any program you buy for PC will end up being a re-enforcement tool and refresher but I seriously doubt any computer program will be the ""END ALL"" of what you need. Barrons mastering Spanish would be the best study(its boring but effective)"
3,Barrons and the test,"good backgroung but lacking when you came down to it. Some of the questions were outdated and there were wrong answers on occasion. However, it did give the student confidence and that is very important."
2,Not good enough,"This book has its pros. The practice tests are amazing similiar to the actual SAT II exam. However, the written lectures on biology are messy and cluttery. The book tries to cram two years of biology into a few hundred pages, and the result is a mess of unorganized and unhelpful info. My advice: get another book, or take the AP in May if you're in AP Biology, and the SAT II exam in June."
2,Only good for the practice tests,"I used both the Barron's and Kaplan books to review for the Biology E/M. Althought the Barron's book tests are very similar to the actual SAT II, the review in the Barron's book is horrible. I advise that one buy the Barron's just to see how they would score on the test (on both the Barron's and the SAT II, I got a 760), but for the actual subject matter, buy the Kaplan book."
3,Good for the practice tests....,"I was getting a B in my honors biology class, and I decided to take the SAT II Biology. My teacher would keep giving us practice tests to do over the weekend and I would keep getting scores of 500-550, and I almost decided not to cancel taking the test because of a fear of getting a 500 on the test. I bought this book and the Kaplan book and I did not really like this book too much because the review was horrible. It was good for the practice tests though. With the aid of the Kaplan book, I managed to get a 660 on the test, so I suggest getting the Kaplan book for the Biology SAT II."
3,you might want to reconsider,"i am very disappointed with my sat II score. my friends brought both the kaplan and princeton book. he got a 780 for a score. i am pretty much on the same level as he is but only got a 690 on the bio sat II. i aced the barron practice tests but upon further inspection, i have found out that the questions from barron are way EASIER than both princeton and kaplan."
4,"good coverage, A LOT of good coverage","This book is really good and covers all of the bases of biology, but I only have a week to prepare for the test, and all of this material is, well, quite overwhelming. I would definitely reccomend this book if you have two weeks or more to prepare for this test. If you have the test really soon like me I would reccomend going with the Kaplan book."
3,This book was average,I am not a great studier but i did not find this book covered all the topics on the Sat2. The tests were way too easy. I scored nearly 70 points lower on the actual Sats. Decent book but i think you could find better books out there. There was a ton of information but it was too much for me to cram with yet it didn't cover all the questions on the real tests. The answers were well explained to their practice tests but maybe that was because they were so easy.
5,Repeating with Shilov,"I study math for 4 years, so I think that I'm able to say if this book is good or bad. This book is excelent. If I am not a teacher on high school, but I'm interesting in mathematical analysis, this is the book what I need. There is a lot of mathematic's basics, which are usefull in the later courses as Funkcional Analysis or P.D.E."
2,Basically a Waste of Time,Basically a waste of time (including the additional time to write a short review). The very occasional flash of some very nice T&A could in NO WAY salvage this mess.
1,Not worth the time,Goofy show - looks like the budget was half a dozen six packs and some joints. You're supposed to believe that this is a T&A flick but it's not. Next time I'm bored I'll get out my Wild Things DVD and watch it for the 10th time!
1,just plain awful,"this is a very boring film. It has potential for camp, but doesn't utilize it. Is this the same Fred Olen Ray who directed the classics ""Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers"" and ""Bikini Hoe-Down""? Where is the humor in this flick?It has the look of sci-fi T&A, but practically no T or A.The acting, as might be expected, is horrible (althouth the lead is pretty and engaging), but so is the dialogue and plotting. What is John Carradine doing in his cameo?"
2,Absolutely Dreadful!,"As a fan of B-movies, I thought I would get a kick out of this one. Don't get me wrong, I laughed out loud several times while watching this. But it's just. So. Bad. This movie is just the twisted fantasy of its creator--evidently, half-naked (and a couple times, just plain naked) lady prisoners is what some people are into. I enjoyed the campiness, but will never, EVER watch this again. You have been warned."
4,Hilariously Bad,"Hokey, cliched, comically terrible and an absolute joy for any B Movie lover to watch. An amazingly hard to track down film,as well, I discovered. ."
1,Horrible is all,This movie just could have been a lot better. It just could have been a filled with a lot more action.
1,Why was this movie made?,"What was the expected payoff? Making a buck because horny teen boys will buy pretty much any movie if the jpegs and tag lines are promising enough? A vanity thing for the cast, like some people publish books that only their family and friends would even consider buying? A cunning commie plot to destroy the deep respect Americans have for Hollywood?If there really is a hell, surely this is one movie - maybe the ONLY movie - that inmates will be forced to watch night after night for all eternity, after long days of shoveling hot embers around."
1,Utter indolence!,"How hard is it to release Bruce Lee movies in 5.1 (both English and Cantonese) and with a cleaned up, anamorphic picture? Every other region has 5.1 and anamorphic widescreen why is Region 1 the ONLY one without this? Bruce Lee was the best there is and ever will be and I don't see how DVD producers can make such a mockery and be so disrespectful by making this garbage they call a DVD. GIVE US WHAT WE WANT!"
4,Kick Ass! Literally!,"I didn't know anything about .45 when I rented it so I didn't know what to expect, and it was a nice surprise! First of all the performances of Milla Jovovich and Angus Macfadyen are brilliant. The story is compelling with an interesting plot twist and not to forget a hot kissing scene between Mila and the gorgeous Aisha Tyler.As a girl I found a few scenes very hard too watch, so if you're a wuzz I wouldn't recommend this film. But at least Mila gets her revenge!!I didn't like the monologues to the camera, but that's just personal preference I guess.Overall, worth a watch for sure. Can't wait what director Gary Lennon comes up with next, .45 already set the bar high!"
4,Dark Disturbing movie,"This movie is not for everyone. A scene in which the male lead abuses the female lead is especially disturbing. The film had a Documentry type feel to it, with the characters talking directly to the audience as if the events had already occured. I enjoyed the movie, but its disturbing themes may make this film difficult for all to enjoy"
4,GREAT MILIA,I WANTED THIS FILM FROM HER - SHE IS MULTI-TALENTED - THE STORY IS GREAT - SUTTLE AND TO THE POINTHOWEVER I REMEMBER THE VERSION FROM CABLE HAVING MORE INTIMATE SCENES AND THIS DOESN'T
4,gritty,".45 is a frightening, gritty film with great performances from Milla Jovovich and Angus Macfadyen. Gary Lennon's direction is superb."
5,"Funny, dark, unique",".45 is a breath of fresh air when it comes to the genre of indie movies. Funny often biting humor mixed with a cast of characters you don't see every day. Milla Jovovich gives a GREAT performance as a lovestruck neighborhood girl who is caught in an abusive relationship. Speeches directed to the camera are really funny. The beating scene is a bit hard to watch but so compelling you can't help but. The dialogue keeps it going. In a world of cookie cutter movies, .45 is unique and worthwhile!"
1,Milla... this was not good.,"This movie was not good. I am a fan of Milla Jovovich but this was just not a good movie at all. The story was pretty crappy and I just found it to be a second rate straight to DVD film, which ultimately it was. I don't think it was the acting that was all that bad, the story just sucked and I found it to be really stupid. I think the writer had an idea of where he/she (not sure) wanted to go and it would have and could have been interesting but whoever actually wrote the script didn't do a very good job.I wanted to like it but it just wasn't... good."
4,Good Sales Tactics,"Watch out for the sales tactics. Ask yourself: ""Is Strike King's jig that much better than other jigs?"". I admit I fell for the sales pitch and ran out and bought the Strike King jigs that Denny mentions throughout the book but don't get sucked in like I did. I'm sure there's alternative jigs on sale that would work out just as good."
4,Brauer Makes a Strong Case for the Jig,"The three best things I got from this book are the jig must fall straight down to trigger the most strikes, you must be a keen line watcher to detect stikes; especially soft strikes, and third jigs catch bigger fish. I've proven this third statement to myself over and over again."
4,Jig Fishing Secrets,"I wouldn't call any of his tips secrets, but overall it was a pretty informative book with a touch of humor."
2,Reads Old,"I enjoy jig fishing, and thought I would pick up this book to help out with my technique. I find the book to be good overall, but outdated in some aspects. It just reads like an older book when pertaining to equipment used, and jig material and trailers. It is almost 20 years old. But it does cover all the basics, and is one of the only books out there about jig fishing, so there really isn't an alternative, If you are into jigs, and can't find anything else to read about them, buy this book."
5,Quality and service also satisfactory knife!,"This knife is very cool, the quality is very good also, and laudable is this knife company's service, I bought this knife: due to find some problems, the company now put a new knife sent to me!"
4,Nice!,"Having not played guitar for twenty years, I wanted to get back to playing again for my own enjoyment. I didn't want to spend a lot for an easily fretted, nice sounding instrument and this guitar fills that bill. It has good looks to go along with its nice deep mellow sound and is easily fretted, my three requirements. A great guitar and a bargan for the money. I'm very pleased with this guitar. If I had it to do over, I'd get another one just like it."
4,guitar beginner's review,"I got this guitar after just 3 or 4 lessons, to practice on and stuff, and i was very pleased when i opened the box. The guitar has held up nicely, no scratches or dents even though i accidentally bang it against tables, etc. It sounds good to me, but i dont have much to compare it to...overall i am very happy with it"
1,Very Disappointed,"When I received the guitar and unzipped the bag I was in shock. The first thing I saw were the ""dirty"" tune keys that looked like they had never been wiped off. They were brown with dirt. The guitar had 3 nylon strings and 3 steel strings which was a total turn off. The body of the guitar was scraped and damaged more than the seller had mentioned. I was so discusted I didn't even take it all the way out of the bag. Back it went! I'll never buy used on Amazon again. What a disappointing experience and I'm sorry to say that this isn't my first time. People must be really desperate for money!"
3,"My advice, get a separate book to supplement","As one reviewer said, the book is trying to be simple. Some of the examples are so simple that they don't even test you're learning. And the more challenging examples seem to come out of nowhere. Also the organization is slightly convoluted and a little hard to follow with a full understanding. I recommend attaining another chem book to supplement this one if you must get this for a class. I personally found this book to be so confusing."
4,An interesting biography of this fascinating man....,"While reading this book aloud to a six-year-old, who had picked it out, I learned a lot about this man, Houdini, who has become a legend. In a classic biography format, this book takes us through Houdini's childhood as a son of poor immigrants who admires acrobats in the cirus and makes up his own act. As a young man, he gets work as a locksmith and learns how to pick any lock... a talent that would come in very handy! Throughout his adulthood, Houdini worked incredibly hard to make a name for himself; sadly, his hard-earned fame indirectly led to his untimely death. Houdini's story is one of perseverence rather than glamour and stardom. The book has a serious tone for a childrens' book; even the illustrations are somber, but it is interesting and well worth a read."
5,As Good As They Get,"""How to Gamble at the Casinos Without Getting Plucked Like a Chicken"" is as good as gambling books get. It is packed with solid information on which casino games give you the best odds and how (or how NOT) to play them correctly. It is an absolute classic and belongs in every gambler's library along with:""Doyle Brunson's Super System""""Harrington on Hold'em"" (both 1 and 2)""Beat the Dealer"" and""Professional Blackjack"""
5,If you only have one gambling book.....this is it!!!,"Funny title; serious book. This is the first gambling book that truly tells it like it is. There are many other books that contain sound information on strategies and percentages but they all fail to point out the reality of gambling. The author does an excellent job of describing ""Gambler's Ruin"" and which games you should absolutely not play. The math and statistics are as good as any other gambling book but the read and comprehension are made easier thanks to a little humor which does not keep this from being a serious reference. If you only have one gambling book in your library, this is it!!!"
1,I got plucked like a chicken for buying this book....,"While I must admit that this book is written to be more enjoyable than the other gambling/casino books, the information is terrible. The author has a good sense of humor, but not a very good editor.Much of the first section discusses blackjack and how ""not to get plucked like a chicken"" -- the problem with this is that all of the information is incorrect. For 20+ pages, it discusses that an Ace in blackjack is valued at ""1"" or ""10"" -- this would be terrible information for those unfamiliar with blackjack. An ace in blackjack is valued at ""1"" or ""11"" and the fact that such relevant information could slip past the author, I don't know..but after reading that it was difficult to take the remainder of the book seriously."
1,A Real Stinker,"What a depressing book. If you can get past all the charts and graphs, the basic message of the book seems to be ""Don't Gamble!"" And if you do, you aren't going to win because everything is stacked against you. I got plucked good in buying this turkey.."
2,You don't always get what you see,When the product arrived it was a different manufacture and color than what was pictured. It also looked of a much cheaper quality. But I needed it now so I used it. The customer rep said the pictures on their web site represent what the item looks like not the actual item. Seeing that it did not cost much it was easier to just forget it. I would be very careful with this company. I will not order from them again. The 2 stars are for the fast shipping.
3,Guam history,This is a good book as far it goes but the subject could have been treated in more depth. The history of the islands is a good backdrop for the World War II history.
3,Too simple,"When I got it, I needed to spread the leads apart. Well, it didn't peel apart evenly as excepted and tore into one side exposing the wire. Good thing there a lot of wire left.Also, one side of the paired wire has a white marking. Is it for the inner or outer contact? I had to use a DMM and found out the white is for the inner contact. Would be nice to know that in advance."
3,"A fun read, like the female edge but disorganized","I bought this book right before a recent trip to San Francisco. I have to say that I liked the idea of this book more than the actual book itself - it was poorly organized, hard to find pertinent information, and the tone was really grating after a while. And spend some money and put in an index, for god's sake! Still, out of all the traveller's guides for San Fran, this one had tips and ratings that made it a good investment for someone who wants a chatty female opinion on where to sleep, shop, and eat."
1,No English,This book is in French only. There is no indication of this in the offer windows. It's useless for most of us dorks out here in Wonderland. Amazon fooled me again.
3,XTi OWNERS BEWARE,Unlike the advertisements and the reviews this remote does not plug into the XTi. Great. Just got mine.
2,Not a help,"I hoped this would help my father's tremor, which makes it very hard for him to get soup to his mouth. It did not seem to have any noticeable effect. Still trying."
1,Poor quality,"The clock arrived with intact packaging, no sign of damage or violation by external influences. The clock has positions for time set, date set, alarm set, and a ""lock"" position - in which none of the times can be adjusted and in which the clock should operate as designed. However, the clock will not ""lock"" and it is impossible for the alarm function to work without this. The clock also makes an odd ticking sound - especially odd since this is a digital clock. the ticking isn't associated with seconds passing, and varies from a very quick to a slow click, indicative of part of the erroneous functioning of this unit. It's too cheap a clock to deal with return shipping costs. We bought a similar clock at a local pharmacy for the same price which functions as one should. If you buy this be prepared that it may not work and won't be worth the time and hassle to get a refund or replacement (Not that J&R have responded to emails...)"
3,Almost,"The features looked great on paper. I wanted a progressive alarm, battery powered clock. The alarm is progressive but not in volume. The only change is the the number of beeps not the volume of the beeps. The alarm in the clock this replaced started softly with single beeps. It them built to loud volume with multiple beeps. This one does NOT do that. It's a good clock. it just is not what I wanted."
4,Answers to questions that stepparents have.,"This is a great resource for anyone starting a stepfamily. It considers many issues that may not be thought of until it is too late. This book covers issues such as communcation, discipline, religion, and many other topics. It will help new stepparents effectively deal with their new role as parent. A must read if you are in this new role."
1,disappointed,"I think this would have been a great book, but the first one I got had numberous pages with one inch vertical blank spots so that there was no wording to read. I exchanged it for another copy and had the same problem. This second copy even had a business card in it from a salesperson at Barnes and Noble that said ""return to vendor, unreadable due to missing print"". I tried to exchange it for a third copy and got the same thing again... large sections of missing print throughout the book. Finally I gave up and returned it for a refund.I was very disappointed that this book is even being offered out when clearly the distributor has issues with this book missing print."
4,Not really old Destruction,"For an album that I had never heard of I was surprised how good it was. Sure its not the old Destruction, but it has its merits. First of all the cover is the only reason I got this album and this was also my first Destruction album. After finding out this album isn't in the offical Destruction discography it only makes sense to treat this album as an album from a completely new band. The opening track was the only one I liked on my first listen with a great bassline. The rest of the album takes a while to catch on. The most surprising track is Cellar Soul its a great melodic metal track. Brother of Cain is them at their most thrashiest. While God Gifted has great lyrics dealing with a murderer on a plane crash. Continental Drift is a three parter with Fake Tranisition being the first part. The progressiveness in the album is hit or miss you either enjoy it or skip on it.The album as a whole is somewhat interesting with the goods being somewhat hard to find."
4,Good for taping up your hostage,"And makes for a great light-reflecting hostage as well. And much lighter than duct tape, which my hostages find uncomfortable and leaves a styicky residue, which this stuff does not!"
2,Could they make it any THINNER?,"I have used foil tape for various craft projects over the years- I have never seen such a thin foil tape and the price was the same as the tape I usually buy that is 4 times thicker and 3 times bigger of a roll! I use this now to tape closed my do it yourself faraday metal boxes that I have my electric equipment in -should there be a CME, huge solar flare OR EMP, If your batteries and electronics aren't in a faraday box sealed with foil tape- they're not going to work when you need them the most. Look up Carrington event- if you don't know what I'm talking about."
3,Didn't have a use for it,"I bought this just in case I needed it when the washer and dryer were delivered and installed by Best Buy. We didn't need it, but I'm saving it because it looks like just the thing for... I don't know...but I'll know when the time comes."
3,"3M 3311 Foil Tape, 2"" Width, 10 yd Length, Silver","3M 3311 Foil Tape, 2"" Width, 10 yd Length, Silver have not used it yet but it looks like a good product arrived on time good price"
5,"Useful for all kinds of things, strong adhesive","You can use this tape just about anywhere, even on wood surfaces, as long as you don't mind the fact that it looks like tin foil. The main purpose is for sealing air ducts, which it is very good for, but it is a good all-purpose tape to keep around the house as well. Better than gorilla tape in my opinion, because the adhesive on it will succumb to heat and come off, this kind won't. Maybe the only thing better than this would be the super-sticky foil tape that is for leak repair (looks like chewing gum almost underneath when you try to pull it off)."
4,does what its supposed to do,Very pleased. Still learning how to operate. I've bought a couple of the Garmin software programs and have been pleasantly surprised how easy it is to download. Took on fishing trip last week and it was a lifesaver by showing me the river channel (with Fishing Hot Spots software). I still need to get a boat mount because a little cumbersome to hold and drive. Definely need to get rechargeable batteries - goes through them quickly.Overall product does what it is supposed to do -in style.
5,Excellent hiking GPS,"My husband and I own several Garmin GPS units (Forerunner 201, GPSMap 76S) and Rino handheld radio+GPS units. For hiking, we prefer the Garmin GPSMap 76S -- waterproof, topographic mapping capability, good tree cover reception (if held/positioned horizontally), and great for downloading GPS tracks to the computer for trip reporting and future trip planning. The unit's built-in electronic compass is handy and easily calibrated by a couple slow turns in a circle until the unit indicates it's set. The built-in sensor allows the altimeter to be more accurate, adjusting for changes in barometric pressure."
5,Great Value,"I purchased this product primarily for use in my work. I wanted a unit with an electronic compass, altimeter capabilities, and the ability to measure area. After much research, I found that the 76S provides all of those capabilities at a very reasonable cost. Although other units have more bells and whistles, such as color display and memory cards, they are much more expensive. The 76S provides excellent capabilities for my uses at a mid-range cost. The user manual could be somewhat more user-friendly, but this is a minor problem, since the unit is fairly intuitive to use."
3,Poor maps without additional software,"Need additional map software for anything but MAIN highways. Lots of software available, but a bit of a disappointment. Replacing an older Garmin, expected better map built in."
3,"Solid, but it's large and lacks ease-of features","I bought this unit to do some Geocaching with my daughter. When I opened the box, I was surprised by how large this unit was. I didn't pay attention to the size specifications listed on the purchase page. The graphics used to advertise made this unit appear to be about the size of the smaller eTrex Navigator units and their ilk. If you don't mind carrying around something about the size of a Fluke digital multimeter, this would suit your purposes. As for ease-of, the interface for the computer is 9-pin serial which is incovenient. The internal software doesn't allow you to save or show much text for Geocaching. (Some receivers allow you to put in comments and hints.) This unit is very solid, does what it does very well, but lacks a few things that would make it an excellent system for Geocaching. On the positive side, the screen is large and easy to read. The internal altimeter gives you vertical profile capabilities."
4,The Way Back Home,"Megan Johnson is a poet new to me and reading these exquisitely formed and communicative poems opens windows of inspiration like few other young poets can. Here are descriptions of the sensation, the actual feeling of loss - that void that seems to be the precipice of living - drawn so adroitly that we weep with the poet.But the enormity of Megan Johnson's talent goes beyond the time-honored language of weeping and wailing so glorified by the Romantics and instead offers the steely strong cable of defiance of sorrow in the at first floundering about for meaning to the persistent journey to achieve comfort. These poems are indeed powerful and give notice of an original and potent new poetic voice. Recommended. Grady Harp, May 05"
5,O-ring assortment,Exactly as advertised . This assortment is a must in your workshop. I do small repairs and the o-rings are always needing to be replaced and this is a great assortment.
5,Not bad,"Very nice assortment for my needs. Good rubber as well. Very good value as well, given the price. Talking about price, you'd pay the same amount for just 10-15 o-rings at the local Lowes or Home Depot stores... So I purchased this one and the metric box and I should be all set for a few decades..."
5,Great product at a fair price.,"I would not suggest this for the average homeowner but if you are a Plumber, Mechanic or in a field that requires the use of multiple o-rings of different sizes, You cannot go wrong with this purchase. If you are a homeowner who likes to be armed for anything then maybe this will work for you!"
3,Repair it,This has almost all the sizes you need to repair most jobs.The only thing else needed is a o-ring splicing kit.
2,The concept is great but this book lacks practicality,"I was so excited when I got this book but then I read it. I was so disappointed with the lack of practical advice. The authors are quick to point out that copying thin eaters' habits is not the most important part of this weight-loss book. They want you to explore the spiritual depths first, which I think is great but it is eating less and doing more that contributes to sustained weight-loss and everyone knows this. I was hoping to find inspiration and realistic instruction on how to stop eating when full. I found none in this book whatsoever. I found the book to be highly disappointing."
3,"Some good advice but some dangerous advice, too","This book is OK but I've read better books about only eating when you're hungry, eating exactly what you want (not other stuff PLUS what you really wanted in the first place) and other strategies, such as Geneen Roth's ""Breaking Free from Emotional Eating."" ""Ten Habits..."" does make many good points about how babies and children eat -- when they're hungry, what they want, they stop when they've had enough, etc. -- that we sadly lose sight of as we age.There's some good advice in this wordy book but something that knocked it down a star or two for me was some flat-out bad advice. The author says your doctor's office doesn't really need to know your weight unless it's to determine a medication dosage. WRONG. Doctors do not weigh patients on a whim or out of pointless curiosity. They need to know because weight gain or loss can be a symptom of a serious disease. Such flippant advice really rubbed me the wrong way."
4,Jay Gridley is our techie hero!,4 of 5 stars for the book Net Force #8: Changing of the Guard by Tom Clancy (Audio edition). Let's start with the fact that I am a big fan of Tom Clancy and a fan of the Net Force series. I have been reading the series in sequence as there are continuing characters and sub-story-lines. The main focus of this book is several of our Net Force staffers have decided to retire leaving the agency and introducing new replacements. Our techie Jay Gridley continues with Net Force. The plot of this book is relatively simple and also not as interesting as the previous books in the series. A disk with encoded data is obtained by Net Force which will reveal the identity of many spys. Those who lost the disk want the information to remain secret and learn that Gridley is working to decode the data. They send an assassin after Gridley to keep him from decoding. All in all a good book and worth the read. Its not the best in the Net Force series.
4,"Light, easy to read story...","This book was a lot of fun to read because it addressed one of the secret wishes a lot of middle-aged women keep to themselves -to wake up in a younger, glamorous body with a dream job, sexy boyfriend, and a limo :) I won't spoil how it happens so follow the fun tale of Elisabeth Whitfield as she takes over the body of TV reporter Gypsy Dugan and sit on the edge of your seat wondering what she's going to do next! Will she really use Gypsy's body to get her own husbands attention?! You bet :)"
4,Once More With Feeling,I have always enjoyed Emilie Richards books and have read all of them. This was very well written and such a good story line.I couldn't wait to finish it as I wasn't sure where the story line would lead. Very imaginative and well written.
1,The Price Makes No Sense,"It makes zero sense to spend $198 on this 6-season package, when buying the individual seasons separately would run you $106 at their current price. Save $92 and buy them individually."
4,Get It,"Messy Slick is a great album and by today's standards, quite possibly a classic album. It's easily one of the best rap albums released in 2007 and in my oppinion, the best album Messy Marv released since ""Disobayish"". The downfall of the album is the quality of the mixing. It's par for a mixtape, but as an album release they should have had a better engineer."
2,It is NOT COLOR (very misleading name for a B&W product)!,"CONS:* only Black & white (why COLOR in the name???)* recognition of business cards is low (lots of manual editing)* no management of double sided cards* does not come with instructions on how to download Win 7 drivers (corporate web site very misleading ie US, Taiwan, Europe, etc)* challenge to install the proper Win 7 driver once found (however not impossible)PROS:* very small* comes with a nice pouch* CardIris 3 included (pretty good software)* very unexpensive (but do you really need a cheap product which does not the job?* easy return with Amazon.com (lost some money in the shipping back to them though)If you are looking for a great Business Card Scanner, get what I got, ie a PenPower WorldCard Color. a bit more money, but 90% excellent, a big difference.Have fun!RedFormula1"
3,Genius ColorPage BR600 Portable Business Card Scanner,"for the price it is ok, need to help the scanner move the cards when they are not the standard thickness"
3,The little scanner that could,I needed a business card scanner but it was not worth $200 plus to me to get rid of the pile of business cards in the desk drawer.The Genius scanner was the answer. It works great and 95% of the cards were totally correct on the first pass. It was quick and easy. I was able to export the data to Outlook and to synchronize after adding more files. The Cardscan software keeps all the data including the images of the cards so you can go back and look at a card later. It can also link to ACT!.It is great to take on the road as it comes with a small carrying case to hold the scanner and USB cable.The price is low because it has an older version of the IRIS Cardscan software. You can upgrade if you want later.It really is a Genius decision to buy one of these!
4,Bought it for parts,I needed an inexpensive way to get a 300 dpi line scanner. This filled the requirements perfectly. Out of the box I found that the software provided was very limited and that the Twain driver was not universal.
1,Item received isn't as pictured,Item received isn't as pictured. Tried to contact seller to no avail. Would like to get it resolved.
5,Great quality low price.,This sword arived WAY before the suggested date for shipment i was very pleased with that! The construction is strong and very durable for the price. It looks just like the picture. The item was packeged great no damage on it due to shipping (no damage on the item at all). I am extremey impressed with this buy. I will continue doing bussiness with this seller. They have just got a customer for life.
4,Good Condition,The book was a really good read and I enjoyed Kimmel's writing style. This book is good for those who need an understanding of gender and how it is portrayed in contemporary America.
2,"Assumptions, cliches, profanity, and outdated information","I wasn't a fan of Kimmel's writing style... it struck me as being a weird mix of colloquial and juvenile and know-it-all. It seemed like he was using a slang term or colloquialism every other paragraph, often in conjunction with ""big"" words. One sentence that stood out to me was this description of the Palin family: ""Who is this paragon of bad mothering, this feckless father, this slutty teenager, her randy boyfriend with this felonious mother?"" Really, Kimmel? Are you tying to get on college kids' level by using offensive terms such as ""slutty""? Why, of all those adjectives, was that the only word used that the average frat kid will know off the top of his head? Whose level are you trying to get on? I also agree with the previous reviews that said Kimmel makes many assumptions that he then presents as fact, and doesn't seem to have nearly enough citations."
3,Well-written propaganda,"I read this book for a class that I took online at my university. It's a very well-written book (very interesting to read) that provides all sorts of useful information (hence the 3 stars). However, Kimmel makes his opinions very clear and presents them as if they are fact. He believes that gender inequality is the source of all gender difference, and throughout the entire book he makes that belief clear. I have no doubt that this is the message that any proponent of modern liberalism would love to teach, and so it's not suprising that it is the message he brings. He's a very smart man: a good communicator and writer. I just wish that he would be willing to bring up issues with his worldview that he can't refute instead of only dealing with the ones he can, so that we could have a holistic perspective on the psychology of gender. Guaranteed to keep you thinking -- if you're willing to put the effort into reading the 350 pages of text."
3,HMMM,"this book was too boring, even that I'm a Women's Study/ Sociology major, this book didn't help."
3,Sociology Book,"This book has lots and lots of text with few pictures and diagrams. The information is interesting and informative but you have to read deep into it to get that. It's a good book overall, though."
4,Awesome Choir; Dead Audience!,"I Absolutely love this DVD! The songs, the arrangements, the unbridled passion in their voices and choreography, and the colorful outfits combine for an amazing presentation. (Where do I get one of those shirts?)The only downer is the deadpan audience. This should be filmed again in front of an audience that is capable of being moved. I suspect a church would be a more vibrant setting."
4,Excellent classic style metal!,"From the first riff theirs no doubting what these guys are about. If you like your metal old school?, you'll love this cd. It's got it all really when it comes to just straight ahead metal. The only thing that took me a while to warm up to was the vocals. They seem a bit over done at times which sort of takes a little umph out of the overall vibe. I'm not sure if it's bassist doing the back up vocals or the main singer, but one of them needs to chill just a tad.All in all though, this is a very good listen.Pick it up!!"
1,Boring,"Who really liked this cast? They were uninteresting, and ""un"" real. It looked like MTV spent too much time making sure they got the black people, the whites, and the weirdo's! I'm really liking the Chicago cast much better!! Someone to actually relate to! Fun people in their 20's who are trying NOT to get along! NO more CORA! The house tour was pretty good though on the DVD version. If you REALLY REALLY liked this cast, it may be worth it for this and the Hampton scenes otherwise, wait for Real World Chicago."
2,More confusion than opinion:,"Hey to all that watched The Real World You Never Saw - Back To New York...just more of a question, so disregard my star rating of this DVD. I haven't had the chance to watch it yet, but my question is, is this DVD the actual SEASON 10 as well as extra footage, or is it just the 45 minutes of footage? If it's NOT the season 10 dvd, can anyone be so kind as to informing me if they have it for sale yet? I loved the show for this particular season, but I won't waste my $$ if it's not on this one.Thanks so very much to anyone that can help me! :-)"
1,Skip this one if you can,"If you are a vivid fan of the original Austin and Morris Mini's, skip this book because there are only brief descriptions and specs about these car in the book. This book is basically a childhood memory for the author who wrote it. The pictures are black and white. There's only a brief description on the Innocenti and Authi Mini's and only 2 pictures of them. Books to get: Original Mini Cooper and Cooper S by Motorbooks and Chris Rees guide to Mini's."
2,Too textbook for me...,I didn't even get into this book. It was written more like a textbook on how minds work than the helpful toolkit I was hoping for. This won't be staying on my list of books I want to read.
3,Size was too big.,"Good construction, but was too big for child although dimensions were right when ordered.child enjoys."
5,Top Choice!,"Skidaddle! Of the three cds I gave my 3yr old grandson for Christmas, Skidaddle! is definitely his favorite. Fun to sing along to-his favorite song on the albun is TheLion Sleeps Tonight"
2,This is not Penium 4 Nothwood! only 256 Cache not 512!,"This is slow CPU, not worth the money.I Like both company AMD and Intel, but AMD 1.47 Ghz is much faster Notbeook than this.Old Penium4 are slow CPUs!If u buy Penium4 make sure it has 512 Cache wich is Northwood P4"
5,DON'T GET SCARED !,"This book provides an excellent preparation for the real SAT II Math 2C, especially for international students who have not covered many of the topics in detail. The tests of the book are VERY hard ( your real score should be around 100-150 points better ), so don't panic when you review your practice tests.I highly recommend this book since it help me do my part for college admission ( 800/800)."
2,barron's confusing and errored book,"I bought this book last year to help me prepare for the sat2c test and while the concept and structure of the book is excellent, the book actually contains several mistakes that prevented me from learning the problem's real answer. At one point I was so frustrated with the mistakes it had I decided not to study for the 2c anymore until either the next edition without errors came out or until I found another, better book. Not only that but the answer explanations are vague and if you don't have extensive knowledge of all the material, then you probably won't understand barron's explanation. i don't recommend using this book to help you study for the 2c test as the practice tests they give actually ARE harder and you might not want to spend the extra time needed."
4,Great but not realistic,"I took the SAT Math IIC in June'04 and used the Barrons book for preparation.With it, you learn a lot of stuff, most of which will never come on the SAT.What I especially hated were the practice tests. These tests are so hard that I nearly changed the registered SAT test from IIC to IC. (You can't belief how happy I am that I didn't).So if you buy this book, you have got to know the one important thing: A 30 in a Barron practice test is like a perfect score on the SAT."
4,good book once u adapt,"This book is an excellent in terms of preparing you for the SAT II math. The only thing is that you must know going into taking the practice tests that they are MUCH harder than the real thing. I took most of the practice tests and my scores ranged from 650-740. When I took the real test, however, i found it much easier and got an 800. This book helps because you become so used to the harder tests that the real thing is simple. If you don't realize that going in though, you will be very frustrated."
4,too hard,"This book contains much too advanced information for the test. It takes away time to study for topics that are not going to be tested. However, the other books I have read (Princeton Review and Kaplan) are too easy and dont cover enough information."
2,the Book is far from the real test,"I studied only with this book for the SAT MATH 2Cin the barron's book there were some unfamiliar topicsthat I had to spend my valuable time in preparing test which were not necessary.book was very different from the real test.The real test was more easier than the bookWell, It was better than not studying with any bookBy timing and taking sample tests, I could practice for the real test.Yet the book was too difficult and too different than the testI urge the book to be focused on the level of real sat test practically,I want to say that time is not abundant for seniors who are preparing for college."
3,Good but too hard,I think this book realli teaches u a lot~ but its realli too much for the 2C test~ a lotta probs appeared on the model test in this book wont even appear on the real test~ so this book might freak you out when u first start doin it~ but I guess its ok~ cuz to review more will only make ur score higher~However~ from me and my friend's experience~ if you can do 2/3 of the probs in this book~ you will be fine~ 750 and above~
2,This is a JOKE~!,"I went through the 9 testsit was a jokeafter taking ap calc,stats,comp sciencei knew basically everything on thateven the ap exams were harder than thisdon't waste your time, if your good at mathspecially if your asian"
4,SAT IIC math,"There are both good points and bad points about the 6th Edition of Barron's math IIc. Although the book itself is comprehensive, and contains all the information you need to know, (sometimes even more than you have to know), there are a few errors in the book. The diagnostic test is as difficult as the first model test. However, as you sit each model test, you will find it harder to increase your score. This is because the model tests become more difficult. e.g) Model Test 3 is harder than 2, and so on.I received a mark of 800 in the SAT IIc, however in the model tests I usually received a mark of 730-760. (I converted my mark using the real SAT II book by collegeboard) So don't worry if you are getting 750 in the model tests, because in the real one, you will probably get 800. Although answers of every question are explained, due to some minor errors, and the poor layout in the book, I give a rating of 4 out of 5."
4,A Very Good Book...With a Few Errors,"Of the many math books available I'm sure that most have much better grammar and also less spelling mistakes, but if you overlook these few shortcomings then this is definately a book you want. You should, however, be willing to put in some time as this book IS NOT FOR CRAMMING. If that's what you're after then stay clear of this one. I recieved a 790 on the real thing, that's a pretty good testament to the power of this book to help you prepare. I would recomend taking about a month to prepare using this book, studying every night for an hour or so, and then taking as many practice tests as possible as I was only able to complete about 4 of the 8 tests. This book is very good, however, I can only give it 4 stars due to the lack of quality and polish in the book. Some of the questions are marked wrong, giving to the wrong answer to the question, and there are some other little things that could be fixed. I hope the next edition is better."
2,okay...but a lot of unnecessary material,"If you go through this book and take the tests, you will most likely get the score that you want. However, you will spend many hours OVERPREPARING for the math IIC.Almost all of the practice questions are harder than that on the real math IIC, and the practice tests are impossible. Also, there is material (such as parametric equations)which is over-emphasized, yet these things hardly ever show up on the exams.My suggestion to get a good score is to buy this book and the Princeton Review math book (which will UNDER-prepare you if you use soley that.) Then you should go through the Princeton book, and see what is really covered on the IIC. Then, after you go through the princeton book, you should go back to this one, and cover what really wasn't covered in detail in the Princeton book.Good luck on your test!"
3,Good...,"This book has lots of practice. After doing the 9 practices, i felt my math has improved a lot. However, this book has quite a bit of typos and the explanations are not very clear (assuming u know everything). My friend and I, who haven't finished taking math 12, had a lot of frustrating experiences with this book because it doesn't explain the concepts very well. Also, this the practices are very hard (which is good if you have a lot time)."
3,Too comprehensive,"This book is for people with lots of time on their hands. It's for the people that want to learn things ""just in case"" or ""just because."" For people like me, who just wanted to know what was necessary, and nothing more, the book is cumbersome. A lot of the material in the book isn't even on the SAT IIc. I would get anywhere from 30 to 40 out of 50 on the practice tests, but I got 800 on the test (12/01). Not to mention, it doesn't approximate your score out of 800. If you're looking to cram, this isn't your book."
5,good,Not the best utensil organizer but it does hold all of our cutlery. the mesh designs allows for debris to go past it so debris doesn't pile up in it like most other utensil organizers.
5,on time and as advertised,Fits a small kitchen drawer and the only organizer on the net which did so.Sturdy and attractive and the price was low. Amazon is the real deal.
4,Great Organizing Tool,"The drawers in my apartment are long, narrow, and shallow, so finding an organizer that would work in them was definitely a challenge. The price for this one is definitely right, so I ordered it, not knowing for sure whether it would fit in my drawer. Well, it does, and I'm very pleased with it! All of my silverware (flatware for 4) fit in the compartments, and the extra compartment can hold things like ice cream scoops or measuring spoons.The only reason why I'm not giving this product five stars is that, when it arrived, the mesh in one of the corners was dented in. I applied some pressure to the area and was able to fix it. There was no damage to the thick metal bars, which are the ""scaffolding"" of the organizer.If you order this product and it doesn't fit in your kitchen, you can still find uses for it, so don't send it back! It also works well as a school supply or jewelry organizer. You can even use it in your cabinets to hold small items like teabags or spices."
4,Perfect Size,"This is the only cutlery organizer I was able to find that fit my narrow drawers. Good price, functional design."
4,Good silverware organizer,"This organizer works well for my silverware drawer. I wish that each compartment was just a little wider, though, as my silverware is a little jammed in there. However, in general, it was just what I expected and is serving its purpose well."
5,Best .40S&W cases,"I bought the .40 cal, 100 unprimed case plastic bag. I didn't expect much with the way it was packaged.When I measured each case (digital calipers) I found that the tolerances were spot on with all of them.These shoot well and didn't hang. I'd recommend them."
1,Winchester unprimed brass,"Winchester must be using incorrect mixture of alloys. Three reloads of 7mm Mag and the brass shows real serious stress. These were not ""hot loads"" -- I have been reloading for years and older Winchester brass stood up well, even with ""beefed up loads"". Other experienced reader/shooters and a couple of long time gun smiths and I conclude the brass is too brittle. I/we have not noticed the same problem with Remington, Federal, Norma or Lapua brass. I wouldn't recommend the modern Winchester brass for reloading."
5,Start a beautiful tradition!,My grandmother started a tradition of sending me a Fontanini every year for Christmas. This set was the first that she sent me over 11 years ago. It has held up beautifully! The rendition of the Holy Family is wonderful. The paint is flawless and it is clear that a lot of love is put into every piece. It is made of hard material that truly stands up to the years. My kids spend every Christmas telling the story of Christ's birth using our little Fontanini figures and they have never been able brake or even scratched them. I am so impressed my the quality of Roman and I look forward to increasing my collection every year. You will not be disappointed!
1,The Secret of Cognac is safe,"This book provides an admirable, if tedious history of the Cognac region through the middle ages. Beyond that, it is basically a bald tout of the Cognac industry with no critical elements to it at all. Worse, it provides virtually NO useful information on the specifics of how Cognac is made beyond grand allusions to how wonderful it is. Very disappointing read and an obvious promotion of the industry and region."
3,Nancy Wilson @ Carnegie Hall,"Have been waiting for this DVD, for this lady has shared my interest for many years now + recorded at Carnegie Hall What more could one want????Great concert but poor audio, hallow and very little life from what must have been a great band. Vidio so, so. As reference good, but why not spend some time editing the tapes so we can get the best from a concert like this?SHAME"
5,AWESOME HELMET- GO BROWNS,"The helmet came to my house in two days and in perfect condition. I absolutely love this helmet and I am so happy to have bought it. I recommend this to all NFL fans, get the helmet of your favorite team, you wont be disappointed.I am going to buy one for my brother."
2,"""One woman's Titanic is another woman's Love Boat.""","It is a well thought and thorough episode guide, however I didn't expect (or want) a review of each episode by the author. More often than not, I disagreed with the author's opinion and felt Smith completely missed the mark. Too much criticism and character judgement."
3,Not so easy to use,"The maps are great, they are big enough, and have enough details. At the same time, this atlas is slightly oversized, but this isn't the big problem. The big problem is that the names of the cities on the maps are not in English, they are in each country's native language. So when I tried to find Florence, Italy, I couldn't find it on the map because it was named with its Italian name which is Firenze. I had to look for Florence on the index and find its Italian name then go back to the map to find it. And this all doesn't make it easy to use.Half star off because of its size, one and a half because of the names. Overall it is not so easy to use."
5,Another awesome product from Apple,"Incredibly easy to set up, configure, and use. I have 3 Macs (including a PowerBook) using it as a router, both with Ethernet wiring as well as wireless. Works *flawlessly*."
2,"This might be easy to use, but it's range is abysmal","Though this base station is the easiest to set up, configure, and administer, it is by far the worst in range. At only 150 feet, it pales next to its competitors that are nearly half the price. Netgear and Macsense both make wireless routers that do more, also have built-in modems, have double, even triple the range, and provide more WAN ports (usually 4, some even have 8) for printers and other items on your network. Don't be fooled by its lovely design. This base station needs either a new antenna or a new price, like about a buck for every foot in its limited range."
4,Great summary of events from June 44 - May 45,"I bought a copy of this book in the Frankfurt train station in Germany. It is a concise summary of the events from June 6, 44 all the way through May 45. It gives personal interviews from a German, British and American perspective. I also enjoyed reading accounts from the basic ground pounder to the highest ranking Generals. It is a quick, but in depth read. If your a WW2 buff, this is an excellent book to bring your friend or spouse up to speed. My wife actually enjoyed reading various parts of the book. Yes, it does have a British feel, but the Author does not claim that Market Garden or Dunkirk were ""victories"" like some others have. He gives an honest and truthful account of historical facts. The only recommendation is that the pictures dont really match the material much. It would have been nice to see more maps of actual battles. Overall, very good read and I highly recommend it."
4,"perfect for teenager to hold all ski/snowboard boots/helmets/enough space for extra gloves, socks, snack, etc...............",Looking for a bag easy to carry with skis/snowboard that holds all the gear you need to carry with you..............
5,Transpak XTW,Excellent product. Have owned a few of them before. Wore them out. The XTW is perfect for someone who doesn't want to put a lot of things into the pak so the weight isn't a factor. Great for my wife.
3,An Improvement Over Season SIx - But Still ...,"More of the same after season six essentially changed the overall tone of the show. The quality is better, but still there's no comparison to the earlier episodes. The character of Howard Sprague and his mother makes ""Dinner at Eight"" and ""Big Fish In A Small Town"" entertaining. Barney returns for two episodes - but like last season its just not the same. Recommended for diehard fans only."
4,Correct ending?,"Maybe I'm wrong, but didn't the season's shows have the ending of Opie and Andy walking back up the road after they were done fishing and Opie dropping a fish and going back to pick it up? Or is it on the 8th season. I have prerecorded video tapes of this particular ending of season 7 episodes of Dinner At Eight and the one of Andy going to see Barney in Raleigh. Need assistance with this one."
5,love it,OMG ! I love this seventh season set of dvds. The Andy Griffith Show is my favorite show ever on television.
5,fun for the famliy,great movies for the whole famliy many hours of watching order the whole set shiped fast and good price thanks
5,Watch it every night!,"My husband and I gave up TV about 2 years ago but still enjoy watching an occasional TV show. Andy Griffith is a clean, moral and fun series. We own five seasons and usually watch one or two episodes every night!"
1,"CENSORED, and NO English subtitles","This release is missing 40 minutes of material.The original airing was 180 minutes. This release is only 2 hours and 19 minutes.The UK DVD has the full 180 minutes.Also, this release has no English subtitles. Some people need subtitles to help with the British accents. The UK DVD has English subtitles."
4,Fascinating mystery,"I was not familiar with this case before but now intend to learn more. Emily Watson plays a social worker who assists a man who claims he has killed many people but then contends that his wife did more of the killing than he ever did. There are two episodes during which the story plays out, with only a little of it in court.Excellent acting, directing, and writing. The mystery may never be solved but it is intriguing."
4,It just never gets old.,"I have been eagerly awaiting the release of season four as I am sure many other have been. I do own all previous seasons on DVD and am thrilled with the audio/video transfer. But has anyone else noticed a weak mastering of the audio on season 4? I have to turn up my TV louder to hear it which produces that ""white noise"" sound in the background. Oh well, I can deal with it. Can't wait for season 5!!!!"
5,"Hogan's Hero, Fourth Season","Am in the process of viewing. So far, everything is great! Arrived quickly and in perfect condition."
3,For All Hogan's Heros Nuts,I guess you have to be a Hogan's Heros nut to want to keep seeing these over and over again and I do qualify. The picture and sound quality are the best. It is hard to figure out who was the best actor in this series as they all did a great job.
4,There is no escape....from the laughs,Col. Hogan and his group from Stalag 13 outwit Col. Klink and Sgt. Schultz (which isn't too hard)
5,Love it,This is such an enjoyable tv show. the series shipped quickly. the package and cds are in very good shape :)
5,Hogan!,Hey I like it and that's all your going to get unless you have to put in more words which is rediculous!
2,Barcelona 84,this has been a bootleg (from TV) for about a decade.Nice show but - my boot is the same quality- spanish subtitles and all.Kind of hoping it was some of the 'midnight special' stuff - w. wolfman jack - the street hassle/ growing up in public stuff he did for that TV show- i have it crappy audio but someday it might surface
4,"Strong opening to series, with a several confusing parts.","I am optimistic about the story line itself.The concept of alternate universes and a ""true"" existenceare fascinating ideas. I was a little confused about theallegiences of various characters although to be honest Iknow that was partly Mr Chalker's intention. Years ago Iread the Well of the Soul series and loved the idea of the""create anything"" machine. I think Mr Chalker has created anequally wonderful introduction to the characters and storyhere. I am very excited about where the plot will go."
1,GGW Spring Break 2K1,"This one is reminescent of the GGW forerunner,the ""Dream Girl""series. I didn't get much out of it.GGW has improved a lot since this effort."
3,"Not what I expected, but . . .","Wanted a swivel SQUEEGEE, for ease in re-sealing my driveway. THI is merely an 18"" aluminum tube mounted on a swivel end of a typical pole-handle.THERE IS NO RUBBER-SQUEEGEE BLADE THAT IS TO BE EXPECTED.I have YET to use it, but I'll sign back in after I attempt to use it, who knows maybe it'll work . . ."
5,Creative / Easy / Fun story,"I got this book last week and realy enjoy it a lot.Very cretive, easy food to make.Not so many cook book on the market that make you enjoy cooking.I love it."
5,A masterpiece!,"Wow! I just got this book and it is precious! Beyond my expectations. The layout is perfect, the pictures and the little personal quotes make the reading enjoyable and easy to follow. I have been going to the bakery for several years and was dying to bake my own apple cranberry muffin!So I finally did it and I was very satisfied with the outcome, thanks for the authenticity!"
5,Full Fat and Attitude,"First the good: This book ended our quest for the perfect tart dough. The pear/raisin/ginger muffin is fabulous. The cookies are fabulous, no equal - 5 stars.Now the bad and the ugly: I get that it's frustrating that nimcompoops ask for fat-free baked goods; keep it to yourselves. I have no quibble with the philosophy and practice of cream and butter (I'd probably be drummed out of America's Dairyland if I did). I do quibble with the fact that this is stated again and again and again and again. It begins to feel condescending already! For example, most of us do actually know that a muffin is a kind of cake and that there's half the calories of a scone in a half-scone and that a chocolate macaroon is rich. - minus 1 star"
4,I love their Soho Bakery and love this book!,"Whenever in Soho, I visit Once Upon a Tart Bakery on Sullivan St.The savory tarts and sandwiches are fantastic, and I love to sit outside on their cafe chairs and enjoy lunch.I have enjoyed this book for years now.I just revisited it and made the roasted corn, potato and roasted yellow beet salad.Fantastic combination! I also made the Alsatian Apple Tarts and they were AMAZING!Their savory tart recipes are terrific and I love to read the comments from both authors, Jerome and Frank on each page."
5,A wonderful cookbook.,"I purchaSED this book one for myself and one for my daughter-in-law. Liked it so well, I bought a third one for my son who is headed to culinary school."
3,ALL bibles should be AT LEAST 10-point type,"This bible is about a 9-point type. Now, even if your eyesight is good, this is pretty small print. The bible is an important book, and it should just be mandatory for all publishers to have uniform typeface standards for their bibles to be at least 10-point type, preferably 12 or 14. There would then be no distinction necessary for ""large print"" or ""giant print"", and there would be a more consistent standard of what those classifications actually are. Too many bibles that are supposedly ""large print"" are actually very difficult to read because they are only 9 or 10-point. It's also unfortunate that when it comes to bibles, the price also increases with the size of the print. Very disappointed in this particular bible."
3,Story of my aunt,"I have been looking for this book for a long time. I have lost my copy. The man and wife missionaries in the story (with the snow white prematurely gray hair), the Rounds, are my great aunt and uncle. I very much will be getting a copy of this book!"
5,"My Opinion of the book, Guerriilla Wife","I first read the book,Guerrilla Wife, many years ago when I borrowed a copy from my sister. She had purchased her copy from a book club. I found the book truly fascinating! Later I found a copy at a used book sale, probably in the 1970's. and have reread it very few years since until my copy was about to fall apart. When I discovered Amazon has copies for sale I was delighted! After having read this book 12 times already I find it still fascinating!! The lady who experienced the trials of being a fugative in a foreign land in a primitave culture had an exceptional talent for description."
4,Surviving the War as a Civilian,"Living as a civilian in the Phillipines was a paradise for missionaries and mining employees until December 8, 1941. Within hours, the civilians were forced to flee for their lives as the Japanese landed and began rounding up all Americans and Europeans to be interned in concentration camps. Some decided not to surrender, in spite of the Army's command, and fled to the hills to go into hiding for years. These brave men and women suffered disease, hunger, privation all the time struggling to raise their children and carry on with ""normal"" lives. Published right after the war, it is a very bold look at the lives of these people."
5,"Great product, great service.",This truly lives up to its name as the worlds best milk chocolate I have ever tasted. And this is the best deal I have found on line.
5,I love it!,"Milka is one of the leading producers of chocolates in the world. Founded in Switzerland in 1901, the brand quickly spread throughout Western Europe. In 1990, the company was acquired by Kraft, and their wonderful chocolate is now available throughout the world!I love Milka's Alpine Milk chocolate. It is absolutely delicious - not as sweet as many American chocolates, and with a rich and creamy texture. Want to try a great chocolate? Get Milka's Alpine Milk chocolate!(Review of World's Best Milka Chocolate - Alpine Milk)"
5,I'm spoiled by Milka!,"I was born in Serbia, so I grew up eating Milka chocolates. I guess I have become spoiled by their creamy consistency that I would rate them as one of the best chocolates (above godiva, even.) If anyone has the store World Market close to them, they carry Milka bars. Milk chocolate with WHOLE hazelnuts are my favorite of the MIlka variety!! I highly recommened browsing online and finding a retailer that sells them. YUM!!"
3,Not wide enough for a bath towel,"If all you want to hang are hand towels or washcloths, this will work, but it's not wide enough to use for hanging damp bath towels. Quality is fine - heavy gauge. Just kindof miniature for my needs."
3,Its okay,"First time I ordered it came all bent, returned it for a replacement, no problems with that process! It does the job but not super fancy... makes noise each time the door is moved..."
4,Defective DVD,". . . Be prepared for a problem with episode 7. I've owned four different discs of volume 2. Episodes 5, 6, and 8 play fine but episode 7 won't play at all, it's so pixilated. It makes following the otherwise intriguing storyline (and great animation)difficult."
1,Gave me blisters in-between my toes,"Because my Reefs were getting a bit worn, I was looking for a new comfy flip-flop that would be good for going on semi-long walks. Unfortunately, the first time I wore these Crocs flip-flops I got blisters in-between my toes. I ended up sending this back."
2,Not as comfortable as they say,"I am a teacher, so I am on my feet all day. I wanted a new sandal to wear to school. I already had a brown pair of adidas fitfoam which are great. I was looking for something black, so I thought I would try crocs. I hate the way normal crocs look...but these looked ok. They are alright. I was not impressed. My other sandals are much for comfortable and my feet actually hurt at the end of the day. They do not live up to all the hype!"
2,eh,I switched shoes with my friend one day and wore these shoes. Not only do I think they are not very comfortable they are super ugly. Seriously don't buy these they don't look good on anyone and are overpriced. Just buy some normal flip flops or tevas if your looking for comfort. Don't buyBut I will have to say they are pretty durable
3,Thong pain,I havent worn thong sandals in years but was impressed by the reviews of these sandals. After 3 days they wore a raw spot on between my right toes. Two weeks later and they still are uncomfortable when I try to wear them. I hope to be able wear them in the future but I thought someone should have mentioned the break in time necessary for people who arent used to thongs.
1,disappointment,"This transaction was a disaster!! First I was told they shipped, then an email saying it was out of stock. I tried to communicate to see if a different color could be substituted. No answer back. Then I received a credit for this pair. That was acceptable but I was disappointed it took so long to notify me that they werent available. Then I get a email saying they were shipped. Again I tried to communicate that I didn't want them at this time since the order had been cancelled and refunded. I am still in limbo - no shoes (which is good, since I don't want them) but no communications. I guess I just have to watch my credit card bill to make sure I haven't been billed again. This was way too much of a hassle. Don't know if I'd order again."
5,Great shoes!,"These thongs are great--I'd been looking for something with a bit more support than regular flip-flops. I was skeptical about the advice in other review about ordering a size down, but it was spot on--they are a perfect fit!"
4,CROCS,True to size means nothing. The Crocs run big. Size 9 is an 8. Crocks are OK but not all their hyped up to be. Not worth $39.00 or even $29.00
5,Most comfortable flip-flops,Great product. Everyone in the family has at least one pair. They're super comfortable.
4,Love it,There is lots of cushion especially at the heel. I walk on cement all the time and these shoes really help my sore feet. They also come in many different colors. I want a blue and black pair now.
1,Something Is Wrong :(,"Thecrocs Toddler Athens Sandalhave been my favorite shoes for years, and would have gotten five stars from me a month ago, but something changed recently. Crocs seems to have messed up their manufacturing for these shoes. I just bought three pairs of these and the thongs on ALL THREE pairs are tearing my toes apart.They have a kind of edge on the thong that cuts into the toe next to my big one. After a few days of wearing them I had to stop because my toe was bleeding all the time. My toes have finally healed, so I plan to use a knife to try and fix the problem, but I shouldn't have to be doing this.I am very disappointed."
2,Run large and aren't as comfortable as the other Crocs flip flops,"After I bought thecrocs Women's Capri Flip Flop(in which I adore), I thought I'd give these a shot as well. However, I am not that pleased.These Crocs are not as comfortable as the others. The top part is a stiff rubber (it stands out and away from the foot). I wear a nine, and probably could wear an eight in these. I also am not a fan of how these look on.Two things that are good about these... durability and the fact that they are waterproof.I hope this helps you make your decision!"
5,crocs athens ii unisex,I love this product they hold up very well and are the most comfortable sandal. They are great for everyday wear and no slipping when on the boat.
3,Comfortable but.....,It is nice on your soles but the rubber between where u put ur 2 toes hurts after a while. I think its too wide......that's what she said.
5,Older Style of Crocs,"These are really cute, but what made them cuter was our local CROC Retail store punched a hole in the center of the shoe on top and I bought a cute sparkle ornament and was able to dress them up a little. I bought these on line at Amazon and the Croc Retailer said they were a really old style and was amazed to see them."
5,I hate crocs but these are great,"I hate crocs but these thong sadals are totally different. I bought these for my wife for christmas, she already had a pair and loved them so much I bought her another pair. I'm probably going to buy myself a pair but I still will never buy the original crocs."
4,Love them!,"Ok, the only reason they didn't receive a 5-star... after every day use for two months, my crocs aren't as ""foot supportive""! However, they are so comfortable and my feet don't sweat or stink. Yay! Just a note for first time buyers of ""flip-flop"" crocs: it takes a little time getting used to the thong part of the show. It's a little thicker than I'm used to. Also, I've found the sizes for women to be pretty good. I think so many women are used to their heels/toes hanging off the edge of their sandals that they don't realize that the proper size should have a little extra room at the heal and the toes."
5,My favorite flip flops,I've had 2 pairs and they are by far my favorite flip flops. They are very comfortable and you can walk for miles without discomfort. My wife loved my first pair so much she stole them. They are also very durable.
3,Too Much Room at the Top,"I bought these at a good price (around $23) and ordered a women's 7 sinceI wear a 7 1/2. Needless to say, they are HUGE. However, they are well cushioned and extremely comfortable, so I kept them rather than enduring the hassle of returning them. I only feel comfortable wearing them at home, though. Wish I would have ordered a size smaller. I would give these a rating of 5 if they were true to size."
5,Athens Thong Crocs are the best,"I bought these for my husband because he was always wearing mine. We both find our crocs extemely comfortable. My husband had worn knock-offs of these Athens crocs, but as the saying goes, ""You get what you pay for"". These are far superior in construction and comfort."
4,Nice,Sandal's a sandal in my book... but these are a lot better then the cheap stuff you get at walmart. Very nice. I'd get them again.
4,Beware - Sizes run 1 size to big,"Luv them, but order 1 size smaller - they run BIG - I wear a true W-6 but they were too big. Size W-5 fit great. You might have to go to kids crocs. They should tell you that in item description so you can order correctly. Besides that, I would give them a 5. I have no idea why they are sized so wrong. If you order your true size you will have to return them for one full size smaller for a proper fit."
1,Dissapointed,The shoes were great until we left them outside one day and they shrank and curled up and are now unwearable. The high cost for this product and the fact that it is supposed to be for outdoor use has left me very dissapointed.
2,crocs flip-flops China vs.Mexico,"I have been a fan of Crocs sandals ever since they came out. When I purchased these 2 pairs I was in for a surprise. The Athens Army/Siena pair was made in China, while the all black pair was made in Mexico. The Chinese one, the one I love is just like my previous ones. The one made in Mexico the material feels different, less pliable, less cushioned and the straps slightly smaller. I had to take this pair to the local Crocs store and exchange them for a size larger. At the store they assured me that they would become more cushioned with use, this has not happened. I am extremely disappointed that the quality and feel of the product has diminished :("
3,These Thongs Run Large,The Croc thongs run about two sizes too large. To get a Women's 10 you'll have to order a Men's 6 -- or a 7 at the largest. The sandals would be outstanding with the correct size.
5,The ONLY Thong I'll wear ...,"... and recommended by my podiatrist! I wear (and love them) all year long, indoors and out. Also own the clogs and fleece lined versions, too!"
4,this style runs true to women's size on ME,"I see some reviewers found that it ran bigger than the listed woman's comparable size. I almost always wear a woman's size 8, and these sandals fit EXACTLY in the Mens 6/Womens 8. Not too long or too wide at all!My feet are a B width, and this sandal wasn't overly wide for them, either, like many unisex sandals are. So, as far as sizing, I dunno...I think they run exact.The only criticism I DO have, is that the little nubs or bumps on the insole are a bit uncomfortable at first. I have EXTREMELY sensitive feet, and can't wear many of the sandals that have so-called 'massaging' bumps like these have. Fortunately, they did flatten out a bit after a few wearings, and it was never bad enough to cause blisters.Other than that, the insides are nice and smooth, including the actual thong - a problem I often have with shoes in general, rough areas; my feet rub & blister easily and I am Type 2 diabetic, so I must be careful."
5,Supreme Comfort,"The most comfortable pair of shoes I've owned, closed toe or open. Stink free unlike Nike or Addidas. Comparable to KEEN. Great product."
5,Comfortable Sandals,The sandals were comfortable and light. Feet did not feel tired after wearing for extended periods of time (8 to 10 hours). Also these sandals float (just FYI).
5,Great shoes and service,"These crocs are great, matched what I thought I was ordering, were shipped promply and were competively priced."
2,comfortable but awkward,"the sizes refer to the cushion part of the shoe. however the bottom blue part actual extends the shoe and makes it a whole size larger overall. unless your foot is a perfect match for this flip flop, it may feel a little awkward especially since the shape of the cushion leaves no room for error. if your heal is to big or the flip flop is too small, the back rim of the cushion jabs into your heal and shoots pains all the way to your spine. However, I would recommend at least trying this one out. amazon probably will pay to ship it back if its not satisfactory. They did that for me. Excellent service by amazon.com, but this flip flop is a hit or miss. (round up your size when going for this one 8.5-->9)"
2,"Not a poster; just a piece of paper, printed by a computer.","False advertising, by the seller that I purchased from. I only received a piece of paper, printed by a computer (which, of course, I could have done, myself).Beware this product."
4,Pretty good.,"Not a poster, its regular paper size. But still it's great quality, both paper and image, and was well worth the 5 bucks."
5,Heart Warming,This is one of a series. It is a heart warming story. I recommend starting with the first book in this series. You won't want to miss any of them and the follow through of this family.
5,Samuel and Julia endure.,Katie's Dream is the third in a series of the Wortham family. It was a wonderful book . I think my interest is more keen in this particular series because my parents both endured the Great Depression. The third book was well written and sort of a mystery that I didn't anticipate the discovery of the truth. I will continue to read the series.
3,Not as Good,This one wasn't as good as the first two books. I wanted the characters to stand up for themselves a little more and not be so pushed around. There was a helpless little girl involved and the adults should have done more to protect her.
1,"If you hate your child, buy this book","This is possibly the worst children's book ever. It is cold and depressing. The illustrations are in cool, murky colors that further elicit feelings of sadness. If you want your child to grow up with separation anxiety, this is the book for you."
2,Terrible Confusing Ending,A great build up to a disappointing ending. The kids may like the pictures and the story but you will be left wondering where the boy was. Spend your money elsewhere.
2,some interesting points but clearly conspiracy theory nonsense,"Yes, some interesting points are brought up but the evidence presented is questionable to say the least. Sources are scarcely cited, and things are said to have happened based on no evidence. Additionally, the videos presented seem to be, for lack of better terms, totally fake."
2,Stones Fell Out,I bought this ring for my daughter for Christmas '08 and some of the stones have already fallen out.She was disappointed and needless to say I was too.The ring was very attractive but with the stones falling out not so cute anymore.
2,A less than inspiring outing.,"Peter Levi is an English poet, and for the most part he writes lively if occasionally sloppy prose. It's hard to tell who this biography of John Milton, the great Puritan poet, has been written for, however. Scholars will shun it for its total lack of documentation and its spotty detail. Average readers, wanting to know more about Milton and his times, will find it both condescending at times and frustratingly abstruse at others. Levi's greatest strength are his openly judgmental evaluations of the poems; perhaps he should have published those judgments on their own as a brief ""appreciation"" of Milton."
5,A wonderful celebration of being a girl!,"When I read the review featured under this book I was very dissapointed because this book is special. As the mother of three children, two of which are daughters I was excited to find a book that so aptly fit the younger of my two girls. She is a Tomboy in every sense of the word and sometimes it is hard to find books that feature female characters with the same zest for life and excitement of adventure that my daughter has. This book is about girls who are bold and strong, who love adventure every bit as much as their boy counterparts, and who aren't afraid to get dirty. It celebrates the intelligent,sporty, fun-loving, and sometimes messy part of all girls. This book is a wonderful illustration of the fact that being a girl is what you make it because every girl is different. You don't have to be a boy to be smart and to have fun."
3,nice when it works,"I got two of these for my front yard. They worked nice for about 7 months, until one of them broke. It now stays on constantly, as long as the switch is on. It no longer shuts off by itself, and stays on even during day light."
3,Ordered 5 total But 2 No Longer Work,"In 2 orders, I purchased 5 of these lights to match for an addition to our home. Within 90 day, 2 of the 5 do not work. The electrician says tha the electronics in those 2 lamps are no good. Unfortunately, it's just beyond the return period because of the delay in installing them. I've been in the hospital so now I've got to figure out if I want to gamble on ordering 2 more or try and find something else that's close to them."
4,Ryan Hamner,Great music. Has good sound. If you just want to relax and listen to some meaningful music this artest is a good choice.
5,The Bard and the Junkyard Dog,"""Ye who loves dogs and life and Shakespeare (or any one of those) may also feel fondness for a small book of photos that combines all three in a really original way. It's photographer/sculptor Mark Lamonica's tribute to an unsung part of Americana:junkyards and the valiant beasts who guard them."" Los Angeles Times, December 28,1997"
4,"Excellent, with a need for a new edition","Published in 1990, this book functions as a dense introduction to the full span of Denver history -- from the town's beginnings as a provider of goods and services to miners leaving for the mountains, to its rise as a transportation and medical hub of the Plains, to its recent oil and high-tech booms. The book is thoughtful and intelligent (and basically the only solid semi-recent book I can find about Denver). The ten years since the book was published have seen immense change in Denver (economic revival, massive suburban growth), however, and the volume sorely needs a discussion of how the recent decade's events and growth have changed the metropolitan area."
3,Really Good Video Game,"I HAVE WAITED 2 WEEKS UNTIL I GET THIS LOVELY VIDEO GAME , I HAVE COMPLETED THIS GAME UNTIL THE FINAL BOSS BUT THEN AFTER I KILLED HIM IT SHOW ME THE DESKTOP MENU , I DIDN'T SAW THE END OF THE GAME I HAVE TRYED MANY TIMES ITS SAME PROBLEM , MY PC IS NEW SO I DONT THINK SO THE PROBLEM FROM MY PC , BUT ITS A REALLY COOL HORROR VIDEO GAME ."
3,great mood too many bugs,"this game has the best ambience of any game i have played. great sound, and music. really scary in some parts but sometimes the characters get stuck and you cannot figure out what they are saying so it makes it hard to keep up with plot.you cannot kill any of your team and accidents do happen especially in a firefight. sometimes i shoot a monster but your team gets caught in crossfire and your objective is to keep your team alive. if they die it is game over. objectives are also not so clear at first making it difficult to know what going on. all in all it is a good game, scary with good graphics which have great bodies and blood on the walls. i had no ""unmatched"" graphics as mentioned by another reviewer.all in all a good experience. you need to exert some effort but in the end it is all good with the thing."
2,eh. it's only the thing,I thought this game was going to be cool with your teamates turning against you if your a bad leader. I was wrong. Your teammates turn on you and turn into monters no matter what you do. It's damn annoying and fighting the same monsters over and over again...boring! Get something else. anyTHING.
2,Hillariously Stupid A.I.,"sure this game is kinda fun if you're into the movie but really not all that great. The only thing I found entertaining about it is how hilariously stupid the A.I. is.I even have a story to tell...Upon the point where you have to crawl into the ventilation shafts outside into the underground levels, I realized I couldn't bring my AI helpers with me since they do not know how to crouch.So rather than leaving them out in the cold to freeze to death, I decided to take them out of their misery. So after a good half an hour of trying to command them to walk into a corner, eventually having to physically push them slowly into that corner.Upon doing so, I backed up a good distance and equipped the grenade launcher, switched the first person view and right as I raised the cross hair to their general location, one of my team members said the most random, yet most hilariously appropriate thing ever...!""I have a bad feeling about this..."""
3,Great game but the easy level sure isn't,"the graphics and story line are excellent also the action is fast past,but my complaints are as follows:(maybe some one fromSierra might read this?)1 easy level is too hard(try getting into the armory!)2 sequence is too long between save points-this is strangebecause some save points are very short?3laguage unsuitable for younger people,it doesn' really addto the story line!4sometimes switches between weapons seems to malfunction-I havea new dell with top features and no problems with other programs5 this is a very good game and avid gamers will no doubt beable to get into the armory,but for the rest it will be afrustrating experience-did they forget this was supposed to befun?"
5,"So good, it's HORRIFIC!","One of the best movie to game conversions. Good graphics, sound and handling. Tension and fear is included in this game! This game is as well great for people who didn't see the movie."
1,Seira went past its limits (It was awsome),"All I can say is its a difficult game with a few surprises. Ya sure they dont let you jump, but you never realy need to. Just buy the game and try it out... trust me you will certanly like it!"
2,not so wonderful,"Many of the stories in this collection have interesting concepts behind them. However, most, if not all of them, suffer from Wat's rambling style. At many points in his stories, his style seems overwrought, and it simply serves to obscure the meaning (not in that possitive ""Faulkner"" way). The pick of the litter here is the story of the isle of Kings. In it, Wat seems to state that a society cannot exist in a vacuum. In order for it to grow, it must come into contact with other societies (cultures). Thus, man left to his own devices eventually devolves into a barbarianism. Many of the other stories have good ideas behind them (like this one). However, I found this collection, and it's author's style cumbersome, and unenjoyable. I would recomend it only if you are either previously interested in Wat, or if you're deeply (and I do mean deeply) interested in European existentialism."
1,Defective,"Purchased this series last Sept. and am just now beginning to watch it. It would be very enjoyable except about half the disks are damaged. This is very annoying, I have tried to contact the seller but have received no response. Disappointing to say the least!!"
5,prefection,"If you love Prison break and miss it, then this is the the set for you to have. It takes you from the pilot that started it all to the last season. Seems so long ago that it all began, the actors seemed so new . Fallin love with it all over again,and be reminded why you do and will always have a place in your heart. I recomend this very much,and for me its a precious treasure. A must have!(I recomend ""the fianl break"" to complete the set.)"
4,all kinds of people,This book was a great one for diversity in the classroom. I used this book for student teaching in a preschool classroom and they just loved it! It was a great interactive book the kids just loved being part of!K. Alberici
4,A Good beginning,"This is a good beginning book that is a fast, enjoyable read. It doesn't get too bogged down in dry teachings and philosophy, but gives you enough to give one a beginning feeling. It also gives a feeling as to who Buddha the human being was."
5,Simple and effective.,"This book reviewed the life of Buddha in a simple and effective way. The author explains the meanings of the symbols in Buddha's life and doesn't spend too much time on details. He also explains some of Buddha's wisdom and his religion, but not to the point where it's sickening.This book has effectively let me appreciate the Buddha and is also a good book for a beginner Buddhist."
5,For those who seek,"This is a great book for all those who seek wisdom of faiths . Many of us Think of Buddha as the robust guy , who we think asians think is a God . With this book you learn many things ,, One being that Buddha was not the little fat guy and two that he was born in India and his words spread through asia and europe and finally to the west with not a drop of blood spilled He was never thought of as a God. But a wise person (enlightened one ) Read this you will enjoy, reads easy ,,,"
4,wont be for everyone certainly not kids,"i enjoy it personally but some might be turned off by the constant involvement of sex, blood and bondage oh and possibly the language. not for kids. it does have forms of racism but with the supernaturals, it does have blood guts and gore and sex some of the humor is obvious and some is dry it also tends to make fun of some movies we all know and love."
3,MY son wanted this video.,My son had ask for this Ugly Americans season 1 video and I got it for him. He likes it a lot. I ordered this video and I received three days later that week.
3,A good start,"I bought this dvd thinking it was all season 1, sadly it is only a handful of episodes. I was a little more than disappointed by low number of episodes, but I still like the show. Next time though when volume 2 comes I will waiting for it to be on sale before purchasing."
3,disappointed with only 7 episodes,very suprised to only get 7 episodes for the price.i have watched all of them on netflix and wanted to own them all instead of just 7.otherwise i would have given it 5 stars
4,Tokio Blues,"very easy reading.It has given me a sense for Japanese language, although it has been tranlated to Spanish"
5,"tart, tangy..but good for you","It's what i expected. I like it a lot. It's tart and tangy. I drink a swallow and chase it down with a drink of water. I know it's good for me and I feel better when I drink it. I've never tried a different brand, but I'd definitely buy this again when my bottle is empty."
5,best apple cider I've ever tasted...,I read reviews regarding Braggs Apple cider vinegar. So I decided to give it a try. I have to say I was very impressed. It wasn't as bitter and acidity like most of the other cider vinegars that I have tried. Also I wanted to get the real version of the vinegar that had the Mother label on the bottle. I will continue to use and buy Braggs Apple cider vinegar.
5,Really great pH balanced toner.,"Amongst other uses, my skin has loved this ACV as a facial toner. I mix it with water, 75% AVC: 25% distilled water or green tea. It's an outstanding pH balancer after using a cleanser or masque, and is appropriate for sensitive skin. I haven't been disappointed with any Bragg's product yet."
5,Great for Dogs,"I give 2 tablespoons of this to my English Bulldog every day to help keep his internal organs happy as well as preventing urinary tract infections.When we first got my dog, we realized how strong smelling his urine was. It smelled so acidic I felt like my nostrels were going to melt off - and this was smelling it from a hefty distance outdoors. I knew something was awry so I searched around the internet for some natural solutions. That's when I came across this gem of a product. After a couple of weeks his urine does not smell anymore at all, and he is not as itchy in his one ear as he used to be. I say if you have a dog then you need to get this for your little friend."
5,Love it!,Seriously? What can I say about Apple Cider Vinegar? Good value. Lots of good health benefits. Relieves acid indigestion. Really.
5,successful,This is a great company and they offer great products without any gimmicks. I would highly recommend their products to the general public because its the real thing.
4,"Only Two Days So Far, but high hopes","I ordered this after reading multiple articles online and the reviews here. It has only been 2 days so far, but I am hoping for the best. Honestly, after perusing the internet and reading about all the wonderful things this product benefits, how can you not try it. The price was very reasonable, especially with the super saver shipping, and I will be buying more in the future. Much cheaper than buying it at my local GNC and couldnt even find it at any markets nearby. I will try to update later on when I have time to see the true benefits. Taste is really not that bad at all when mixed with water, and I use just a half glass so it goes down quicker. Not as bad as taking Alka Seltzer and if you hold your nose there is not taste at all."
5,Apple Cider Vinegar,Excellent product with multiple health benefits. I recommend this product. Go to google and read-up on the many benefits from the vinegar cocktail.
5,Excellent product,I have used this product for years but this is the first time I have ordered through Amazon. Excellent ACV!
2,Not for everyone,"Did not like this product.. My husband and I tried this for a week, 7 days,and we both had stomach problems, constipation, etc... We followe d thedirections and tried it another 5 days and still had the same reaction,The other Bragg products work well and their books are amazing withinsights into how you are eating,, but sadly, this product had theopposite effect."
5,Good for you,"I don't love it as to drink it, but it is good for you and I think it helps for alot of different things."
5,Bragg's Organic Apple Cider Vinager,I love Bragg's oraganic apple cider vinager. I have been using it for several months. I decided I would look on Amazon.com for better prices. I was not dissapointed. I recieved my order faster than had been predicted. I will definitley use this supplier again. I love Amazon.com and have never been dissapointed with anything Ive recieved.
5,great product,It arrived very well packaged. I bought it because I have read that it is very effective with the aztec clay mask. It is also good for rinses in the hair.
5,Love it!,"I was extremely late in discovering apple cider vinegar, but I'm glad I did!!! Since I've been suffering from acne I use apple cider vinegar with green tea as a toner for my face and it's wonderful because it cleanse my face and close my pores. It's wonderful in other areas for me too, like my hair and as a supplement. I use it as a final rinse with water and honey to clarify, moisturize and detangle my hair - also great for dry hair. I drink a cap full with a glass of water after every meal as a detox especially if bloating occurs. I love this organic apple cider vinegar and highly recommend :)."
3,no discernible effect so far,Just simply.. two tablespoons twice a day... used a whole bottle so far.. absolutely no effect on anythingexcept for the horrible smell/taste.probably a fine product but so far it's health properties are hidden from me.
5,Good for the skin & other things just do your homework,I break out a lot and when i do i put this on my face and the bumps are gone. Good for drinking and skin tags as well. add honey if you don't like the taste but i don't mind it so i just mix with water. oh and i also use on my hair once a week it leaves it feeling soft. This is a must have because it so much you can do with it. :)
5,I'm considering keeping this stuff in my medicine cabinet...lol...,"Delicious in salads, marinades. But the healing and natural cleansing properties of this product... wow. A tablespoon three times a day (before meals) mixed in 4-6 oz. of water. I've been using this for several weeks and that little patch of annoying bumpy cellulite on my inner thighs is GONE! Go for it girls."
3,Shipping,The product I received was exactly what I needed. My problem is the shipping. UPS broke the bottles...........The Company I purchased items from called to tell me. Thank you. But they stated they would overnight new bottles and also refund my original shipping. It took a week to receive the replacements and no refund.
1,Vinegar all over the box!,"The box arrived an hour ago and as soon as I opened the second box, there was vinegar all over the box! I would like a replacement please!"
1,didn't receive item,"I never received the item. It was in my area for at least 5 days, I had tracked it and talked to the UPS people. Still, it never got to me. I called the company it was produced by, they said call UPS and/or fill out complaint to Amazon. I called UPS numerous times but didn't contact Amazon because I want nothing to do with Pay Pal."
5,Nature's miracle drug!!!,"Bragg's Apple Cider Vinegar is a marvel!!! [I drink a bit and wash it down with a cup of water!] I can immediately feel it at work in my legs which have given me trouble ever since my diagnosis with MS! I Love ALL of Bragg's products, they are the best of the best!!!"
5,Good Stuff,"Got this as a gift for my birthday. Overall it is very good with a good sourness to it. Great on salad or if you are a little more brave, you can drink it straight"
3,Use for Dogs,"I bought this for my dogs to use as a supplement - not sure if it helps. I've recently found it for cheaper in my local grocery store, which is the reason for only 3 stars."
4,Good for what ails you.,For the past two weeks I have been suffering from joint pain. I didn't like the idea of taking so many over the counter pain pills to stop the pain so I looked for a natural alternative.I read a few articles about the benefits of unfiltered ACV. I bought Bragg's ACV and used it for the past three days. I put about 2tsps in a cup of herbal tea three times a day. Almost the next day the pain was better. But now on the third day the pain is nearly gone.Anyone who has suffered from any sort of joint pain knows the frustration and irritation of not being able to do things you want to do and how the nagging dull ache can keep you up at night. Needless to say a lack of sleep can make anyone disagreeable and causes other health issues as well.If you have some minor arthritis or stress related joint aches try Bragg's ACV. It is not a cure all but it may help.
5,Great stuff,Although it tastes bad (my own preference) this drink is really good for you and you can actually feel your cells becoming hydrated when you add it to water.
5,ACV for appetite control,I take a teaspoon of this first thing in the am and right before bed. I have lost 20 lbs in a month. I also take a fat burner that has ACV in the formula. The fatburner is specialized for women but my wife has lost a lot weight from it so I figured why not take it.I feel great and have lots of energy.
5,Saving Money,"I ordered 4 bottles of joop so i could get free ups shipping.They were short one bottle but did not penalize me and i still received free ups and i do appreciate that.I also saved over $60.00.Joe NardoneBurbank,Illinois"
2,Cost Too Much !!!!,"I paid almost $10 dollars for this item! I could have purchased it at Whole Foods, which I will do next time! The product itself is great though."
4,good toner for skin,This can be a good toner for oily skin but it has a really strong smell! Not everyone likes the smell of vinegar so use it at night.
4,This is pure and simply the best.,"I understand that apple cider vinegar is apple cider vinegar, but this is by far the best I've tried yet."
5,puppet in the hand of the King,"We are all puppets in the hand of GOD as GOD has chosen us to be a certain thing in his grand orchestrated piece of musical call LIFE.There is a parity of LIFE in the court of Luis XIV and our LIFE in the grandiose of the universe, we, yet follow our fate with no hesitation, if anything turn out not as we expected, we just shrugged and say 'that's life' or 'things happen for a reason' or 'GOD miracle works in a mysterious way'.I watched this for the second time and appreciated much much more...the main underlying theme in this movie, beside all that spectacles for the eyes, one poignant quote stands out so prominent and it may got lost as viewer may have not recognize it whilst trying to find the story plot (but there is no plot here):'there is no soul so weak that it cannot, when guided, acquire an absolute power over the passion' (Descartes)."
2,Beautiful but boring,"The scenery was beautiful. The lavish parties awe inspiring. The acting good. The story BORING. The story was mostly about putting together lavish parties to impress the king. The only character you get to know on any level is Vatel. All the others were shallow. You get an impression of their relationships, but nothing more. I love period pieces, but not this one. If you've seen it already and enjoyed it, by all means buy it. If you're buying because you think you'll like it, rent it first!"
4,Beautiful Pictures Throughout The Book.,"Don't get this confused with the book of Dracula short stories that was released under the same name, because it's not.This is a nice little book that has lots of great pictures. I tells of the history of Dracula in print and in movies. There isn't much content to it, but the photos of Christopher Lee and Bela Lugosi are worth it. It has bunch of photos of the movie posters and everything. I'm glad I found this little beauty and for such a price!If anyone has a link to the publisher Bison Group I'd be grateful!"
2,Dreadful and cliched,"Since the only 'review' is provided by the distributer, let me at least warn unsuspecting customers of how truly awful this film is. I got it from the library and so wasn't suckered out of any $ to watch it, but still felt cheated of the 40 minutes of my life (the entire film's running time) I sat through. While the production values are adequate (barely), this is really a very stereoptypical and cliched view of one small corner of the Indian homosexual milieu, namely two homely overweight drag queens who roll their eyes and engage in bitchy banter non-stop, while vying for the affection of a dumb would-be actor. It might provide some small sociological value as one of the few Hindi films depicting gay life, but trust me - it doesn't exactly promote tolerance or understanding. And it offensively has to trot out an AIDS diagnosis towards the end to provide some sort of emotional response."
1,It is out of date!!!,The quixtar website explained in this book is out of date. The site has been totally changed. It is worthless. Ignore other two reviews. Those were written 4 years ago.
3,Disappointed!!!,Plain and simple I am disappointed!! 2 episodes for $17.??? It starts with episode 2 where is episode 1??? No extra features no background to characters just episodes 2 and 3... WTF???
2,Don't Buy,This film was awful. The film only has two 30minute episodes in total. There are only a few funny parts but not worth buying
3,Missing out,"The characters were funny and i liked the vibe of the series. BUT there were only two episodes and not even an episode 1. I've never seen a series with two episodes, especially one that doesnt even start you off with the first episode. I felt as though i missed out on alot. I wouldnt recommend this to anyone else...based on the quality of the product...it could have been so much better."
2,Eau d' ouche,"I was disappointed . Once again the Gay Black Man was reduced to a modern day minstrel show, practically tap dancing and eating watermelon .I cringed every time the characters went into their I'm so fabulous act , trying to out diva each other. In truth that would be ok had there been some redemption . If every single character wasn't exactly alike . Or maybe the life behind closed doors not being all that glitters or if the comedy was funny . But alas nothing side spliting . The product description says something like "" Christopher street and his diverse group of friends .... diverse group ??? say what ?? I couldn't tell one character from another . I still don't know which one was Christopher Street. I'm always happy to see gay men portrayed in media , so I'm glad I bought the DVD . But for it entertainment value , acting and overall production ... thumbs down"
1,Buy at own risk,"This is supposed to be a series but there are only two episodes, starting with #2. The acting is bad, but the writing had potential. I paid 17 bucks for it and that is most certainly a rip off. Overall I was very disappointed and I will be returning the item."
1,Horrible...,"Do not waste your money. It is the lowest of a low budget film. Please don't do it. Blah, blah, blah..."
4,"Very interesting, good watch","The only drawback here is the use of war footage that introduces each ""act"" of the movie, footage that just drones on forever. After that though, some very interesting ideas are put forth - particularly like the breakdown of religion in act 1."
5,Awesome,"I saw this for free on YouTube then got into a debate about it and rented it on Net Flix and then said, ""I like this so much I will buy it."""
4,Thought provocking but not perfect,"I found this film to be very interesting. However I'm not naive enough to consider everything to be pure fact. Some of the claims about Horus I know not to be %100. The 911 stuff is fishy for sure. Some of the other reviewers dismiss it as crack pot conspiracy. I don't agree. The plane that apparently crashed into the pentagon is something I've looked into, and I can't find any evidence that supports the official explanation. The banking system in the United States is very corrupt and this is not something that needs debate. There have been numerous other documentary's made on the banking systems corruption."
3,could of been better...,"The movie wasn't the original, but i still enjoyed the documentary. Hard to find the original though, I would of prefered the original."
1,Where Propaganda begins but sadly doesn't end,"There are countless factual errors that you don't even need a degree in Egyptian mythology to find. There are hundreds of Debunkings of this film online. What this film is, is the first in a series of fear mongering propaganda that preys on the paranoid and weak minded. Anybody with half a brain would know within Minutes that this films assumptions are wrong even if they sit though the whole thing the lack of Citations or any real sources for the material presented is sheer proof the ""Film maker"" which is a loose term as this garbage was probably made on a 10 year old video editor, made every last thing in this ""movie"" up. Steer clear and if anybody says you need to see this have them committed only the criminally insane will get anything out of this trash."
1,The Parenoid Style in American Politics,"There are several good books to read about the paranoid style in American Politics.Fenster, Conspiracy Theories: Secrecy and Power in the American Culture.Michael Barkun, A Culture of Conspiracy.This film weaves a preposterous conspiracy theory, defying all logical reasoning. For this supposed conspiracy to work, one has to believe that thousands of security personnel, air traffic controllers, government officials, military personnel were in on a vast conspiracy. Nonsense.This book is a disservice to the brave men and women who died on 9/11, and those who continue to suffer from that sad day."
3,huh?,Did anyone get why she had to go around like a little whore and entice all of the male population? I didn't quite get the purpose behind that.
2,Disappointing,"I am a huge fan of Rosemary Rogers, at least of her earlier books. Ms. Rogers is capable of much, much better than this latest offering. Sapphire is not only disappointing, it is predictible and boring. There's just no substance to it. Books like The Wildest Heart are impossible to put down, and I usually read them in two days. It took me two weeks to read Sapphire, and that was forced."
1,Not a precious gem at all.....,"I have to agree with most of the reviewers that this book was not her best work. I could not believe that she forgave Blake for everything he had done to her. First, turning her into a maid and forgetting about her for long periods - it seemed as though he only remembered her when he saw her and then totally forgot her when she was out of sight! Furthermore, having come quite far into the book, I was dissappointed in Blake when he had a one-nighter with his neighbour - and Sapphire forgave him?!! Don't waste your time on this one - I'd suggest a Lucy Monroe for your next read."
3,Surprised!!!,Not her best---but worth a read! Not her best is still usually better than most author's best out there.
1,Skip this one,"What an awful book! The heroine is completely unlikeable, so that hinders the reader right from the start. The plot feels forced. The dialogue doesn't flow. It's just a mess. Spend your money elsewhere."
4,I like this book,"I am a big fan for Ms Rogers. Reading other people review makes me hesitate to read her latest book. But I always trust Ms Harriet's review and I am glad that Ms Rogers and Ms Harriet do not disappoint me. Of course, Sapphire is not as great as Rogers earlier books- Sweet Savage Love or Wicked Loving Lies. but I still enjoy reading it, especially during the cold raining night with a cup of hot tea, this book makes me feel warm and relax. Thank you Ms Rogers, and keep writing good books for your loyal fans."
2,Discoloration on Belgique skillet,"Does anyone know what causes blue/purple/yellow /while discoloration on the pans? I used baking soda, SOS pads, and finally, Comet but it will not come off. I have found this happens frequently when I use the pan and occasionally, when I cook something, it clears it all off - which makes me think whatever that was went into my food..."
4,Excellent intelligent entertainment for kids,"We're Americans living in Germany, so don't get any of the episodes on regular US TV. Picked this up on arecent visit, and my son loves it. We only had the Classic Clues at home, so great to have more variety to choose from. I watched some episodes with him and must say I was very impressed, particularly with the ""Pajama Party"": it explained so well about the earth spinning around the sun, night and day etc. My son got it immediately and enjoys it so much! Definitely great entertainment for the kids, but they learn somthing AND feel like they are partcicpating when Steve/Jo asks them questions. Money well spent!"
5,Grandson loves it,My grandson loves Blue and he adores this DVD. It is good for him ad has taught him words and phrases.
5,Another excelletion to this great series,This new episode of Blue's Clues is a great addition to the collection. A must have for Blue's Clues fans.
4,Blues' cute,"This is a cute Blues Clues DVD, but it's not actually my favorite. It's all of Blue's big moments, so it doesn't have as much of an educational twist to it as most. Cute to watch, but just not my favorite Blues Clues DVD."
4,"At least half good, but why no SEASON sets?","Hey, I'm not going to start a Steve vs. Joe argument, but I just think that many of the early shows are classics and many of the later ones aren't. This disc illustrates my point well. However, the later shows have the disadvantage of being compared to the earlier ones, although they are still better than half the kids shows on now.My 7-year old son learned so much from BC, and it continues to educate. In fact there are several kids shows out there that have based their ""interactive"" format on this show (Little Einsteins, Mickey Mouse Clubhouse, etc). Maybe it's because I've been watching it so long (now with twin 2-year old daughters who love it also) that I see it wearing thin.With the 10th anniversary having come and gone, WHY haven't these episodes been released in season box sets? Has anyone heard if this is planned? It would make more sense than single discs...I still love BC, and I appreciate all the enjoyment it has given my kids and myself."
3,Belkin Surge Protector,"Item works well as described but is very bulky even with swivel plug out of the way.not ideal for airline travel, ok for drive/travel."
2,Not suitable for 220V,It is not clear enough from the information provided with the product that this Surge Protector is not to be used with 220V current. The Code of the product leads to misunderstanding.
1,Not for International use,I got this will a new Dell laptop.The first time I traveled internationally I plugged it in and it popped and smoke came out of it.It is for USA only. Do not try to use this internationally.
3,What? $97.99,Can someone tell me why in tarnation it says the regular price is $97.99? That's crazy!Who checks for these typos and did anyone else notice this?
5,Awesome!,"This little surge protector saved my computer! After someone hit a transformer in my neighborhood, a massive surge went through my house and the whole county. This protector and another fried, but my computer didn't! Well done Belkin! :)"
5,Works as intended,This works as intended. I like the fact it has 2 outlets which is better than the similar APC surge protector.
4,handy compact with nice side outlets,"nice compact surge protector, especially useful for laptops and other devices when travelling. side outlets very handy to organize wires."
2,Blew out after minimal use,"This worked well for awhile, then blew out when I plugged my netbook in (there was a visible electric spark. There was some damage to the netbook (it required a new power cord and careful maneuvering with the cord to get it to charge now). As well, after I attempted to plug it in again, it tripped the breaker. Something clearly went wrong within my device. Belkin's warranty policy requires you to send the damaged device in with no guarantee that it will be fixed, and it just wasn't worth it for an older netbook."
3,Misleading part number - NOT for international travel,"This surge protector blew the circuit breaker in my hotel room in Spain, and I spent a day without electricity or air conditioning. I found out that it is not designed for European 220V circuits, but nothing in the literature says that."
1,don't take international,"Maybe I let myself be duped, but I thought ""travel"" meant that outside the US was included. I mean it was 220 in the name but I can tell you it doesn't refer to the voltage. This is a 120 V only device. I bought this for international travel and it promptly exploded. I wasted my money - don't waste yours."
4,surge protector review,versatile and well made. could be a little smaller but definitely worth the price.
1,QUICKLY - Stopped working 9/30/2012,"What a poor product...as I usually return items within the 30 day return policy, this one stopped about 45 days and there is no way to sent it back for a replacement after 30 days...Previous feedback - One side places the item you plug in up against the wall so only a ""normal"" plug will work, however, they faced the other one so a 3 prong plug would face outward. Therefore if you use two 3 prong plugs this will not work. I would have preferred both side to face outward so I could plug in two 3 prong plugs, would have then been a 5 star, better to have and not need then to need and not have."
4,Handy traveler,"This travels well and I think will be good protection for my laptop and printer for on the road. I am pleased the the size even though it is a little heavier than I thought it would be. I don't like to take a chance in hotels charging and using my laptop, so this gives me peace of mind."
4,Fun Toy for Winter & More,"This is being played with by all the kids on the street. Kids aged 4 through 9 had so much fun with this outdoor snow bunker! The kids played for hours with their thermos filled with hot chocolate, snow gear and buckets. They pretended to be arctic explorers, adventurers and more. Now that the snow is gone it's still up and the kids keep wondering when the weather will permit to continue their arctic adventures!It's still up on my deck waiting patiently for more snow. We have not experienced any of the durability problems mentioned by the other person, in fact it's been up through all the rain, wind and ice that we've had since the last snow... It's still fully inflated!"
1,POS,This POS broke on first use after being hit by a snow ball....is'nt that supposed to be the idea????!?!?!?!?? Avoid Aviva products if this is a representation of their quality.
2,And another Duped Fan,"The Real Bruce should return to kick the producers behinds! They're a lot of refernces to behind kicking by a female actress in this film which brought images of the Producer(s) touching there shoes. Giveing this film 2 stars because of the Early Films of Bruce and those are only 10-15 minuetes and the Press Conference which only has Bruce saying 'Thank You' then sitting back in his chair. In Bruce's Dialog 'Don't Waste Your self"""
1,Better to go elsewhere,"I enjoy and seek out books written about bible prophesy, so when I bought this one which claimed to have new insight into the last book of the bible, I was very excited. After getting halfway through the book, I was asking myself what in this book has anything to do with the bible, let along the book of Revelation. By the time I finished the book, I was upset because I feel the author had lied in saying this book is about the bible, when the book is about his life and some fantasies that he has conjured up and thrown haphazardly together. The author seems not interested in expounding Revelation, but more in writing an autobiography about himself, and a poorly written one at that. There are numerous other books on the market that really expound on the last book of the bible, and I recommend that a reader refer to one of them, and not to this one. [...]"
2,It's not that fantastic,"2 1/2 stars... I love Jurassic Park and was excited about playing a video game based on it that wasn't a shoot 'em up. But I was dissapointed and bored by this overall. Too much violence is necessary (they really should have made a play-mode for those of us who don't like slaughtering dinosaurs), you're very limited in the things you get to do in the game, you have to focus too much on selling food and appeasing your annoying tourists, you have to treat the dinosaurs like commodities, it doesn't really go anywhere, it gets boring, it loses its charm."
4,"Great Fun, but a bit monotonous","This game is perfect for those who really believe in Jurrasic Park or those who have alot of time on their hands. The graphics are as good as those in the movie and the music is great. There are downsides, though. You can only have a certain amount of dinosaurs (60, I think) and your limited on the diversity. After a while (after you've perfected your park and have 5 stars)there isn't much else to do. That isn't much if you consider the up's of the game. Their is some blood and gore, but it's hard to see. It's no worse than one of Steve Erwin's animal documentaries. The violence isn't bad, either. You see a carnivore attack a herbivore by knocking it over (except raptors, they jump onto thier prey). Basically, if you were able to see the movie, you could play this game. In my opinion, this game is one of the best."
3,A Step in the right direction,"Graphics are good, sound is okay, gameplay is simple. However, the Carnivore AI needs work BIG TIME."
2,An error in this game,"I had problems with Jurassic Park Operation Genesis because it wont work on my computer. I think though it was that I had an advanced computer.I s-ay that if anyone buys this game, they should have an old computer. Thatsbecause when it came out it was when the old computers where sold. And the new computers cant run it."
4,"awesome game, needs some work","this is and awesome game. it would be five stars except for one thing: if you get good at it it gets boring. now i know this sounds general, but it's true. one way it's true is the fact that you only have so much space because you're on an island. because you only have so much room, you can only build so many objects. take feeders, for instance. you can only build eight feeders in your park. you also have a limited amount of species of animals you can create. in addition to that, you also have very little buildings you can build.now that i've gotten past all the bad stuff, we can get to whats good about this game. the grafics are awesome, the idea of dinosaurs is cool, making money is generaly pretty easy,and you have mini games you can play.i say this is a game worth buying. my suggestion to get past all the bad stuff is to not get stuck on one game. start lots of new games so when you're board with one game you can switch to another."
5,Old Time Something Come Back Again...Love Ska Music,"Skasmatic is the best CD I bought in a long time. Luciano is my favorite artist. His ""Wash Away"" song on this CD I play over and over. Mikey General, President Brown, and Chrisinti are culture artists I like a lot too. Female singer, Evette's ""Feel Like Dancing"" gets my kids and I to dance around when I play this CD. Can't stand still with the upbeat vibes. Nice work from the Eight76 Records crew on this CD."
5,Way..Back!,"I think this cd is a must...you love reggae, you love real music, then get this cd. I've listened to every track over and over about 50 times already, it's great all together. I loved each track for different reasons, and you will too, I guarantee it. I'm an Artist my self, a popular one at that, so if you can't take my word for it, then whose can you take? Besides all of that, I know one of the artist personally, and she's bad! Get yours, I got 3!"
2,I thought it was made in China,"I have always bought Klein Tools for quality. The crimped on connector at the end of the wire was not crimped properly, I had to disassemble the unit and crimp it. No big deal except when you pay 3 times as much as a Harbor Freight Tool and the HFT is better. The threaded portion of the probe has very shallow threads and the fit was too tight. Unfortunately this appears to be another American company being run by the bean counters instead of the quality department. I would pay more for quality. I thought I did."
4,Wish it was smaller.,I had one similar and was hoping it would be smaller. No big deal but I can not see why a simple continuity tester can not be produced that is not much larger than a pen or aaa maglight.
3,Continuity Tester,"This tester wasn't exactly what I expected, but I'm sure it will do what I need it to do. I have used many Klein tools in the past and am condfident of the quality. I can't believe the cost of a spare bulb -- that's ridiculous!!!"
2,A Cautious Read,"Monaghan's inconsistent research or editing gets in the way! He gets a number of things right, like the discovery of the missing breadbox forcing Custer's hand a day early. However, at the beginning of his Last Stand chapter, he states that Custer leads 2700 men out of Fort Lincoln. He seemingly counts Crook, Gibbon, and Terry's commands all at one place at the same time ... behind Custer! Then at the end of the chapter, he tells us Lt. Bradley finds the bodies of more than 250 men scattered across the grass. While that number was about right for the total battle, he carelessly lumped the losses from Reno into Custer's battle, with out distinction. I liked the insight he offered about the wives in the final chapter."
4,Very pleased,"My daughter received the loom for Christmas and it was one of the first toys she wanted to open up and use. I helped her with the directions and then she took off with it. My only wish is that the directions would give instructions on how to create something larger than the size of the loom itself. We have an idea of how to do it, but we had to figure it out on our own. Also the fact that the pictures and words in the instructions were on separate pieces of paper added to our initial confusion in learning to use the loom. She wanted to be able to look at the pictures and figure it out for herself, but needed the words and we had to go back and forth to match them up. The wooden loom seems sturdy and comes with all of the things needed to get started right away. I think she will continue to enjoy it and make many more projects."
4,"Slender, readable, more than adequate","A small book on a large subject--But the shorter length makes it more likely to be read. The book has a series of chapters on the expected topics, like dealing with hiring, firing, and the personnel system. It is a worthwhile book, but doesn't have anything startlingly new or original. Still one of the few books to treat this subject from a practioner's view rather than an academic one. If the subject interests you, I'd suggest reading Haass's ""The Power to Persuade"" in addition to (not instead of) this book."
3,Regular,"Battery for Nikon D200, is not original, TTL Flash Cord same and does not work, lacked information in the description."
3,Fantasy World,The Divide is a very confusing book. It is very hard to understand. This book is a fantasy. But once you start getting into the book you will understand it more. A boy was on a vacation with his family. Then suddenly he fainted. When he woke up he was in a different world. This book will keep you reading although it is confusing sometimes.
2,I really want to love this book,"This is one of those books I'm dying to say that i really, really loved. But i can't. I also want to say it has great characterazation and writing stlye, but I can't.ELizabeth Kay comes so close to doing all these things, but the writing style is mediocre. It's a great children's book for most readers, and really enjoy the story overall, I've read it several times.The second two books are much better as the author's writing style matures, and the chacacters get better. THere's nothing wrong with this book, I've read better, but this one's the one i'll remember.You all laugh at me because I'm different, I laugh because YOU'RE ALL THE SAME-This one's been said so many time's I'm not sure anymore."
5,Gotta Read More!,"Thrown into another dimension, worlds away from his parents and his medication, Felix is suffering from a heart disease that, with or without his medication, he can die from. His newfound friends, MYTHICAL CREATURES, are helping him find a cure and a way to get back home using magic where science has failed. But will it be them helping Felix or Felix helping them?The Divide is a thrilling fantasy novel written by Elizabeth Kay that, at the end, will leave you wishing for the next book, Back to the Divide. I've read hundreds of books and The Divide is up in my top two favorites along with Eragon. And who ever said you can't judge a book by its cover was wrong, because the cover is just as cool as the story inside. So stand on the Divide, say the magic words, and get ready for a journey beyond your wildest dream!"
4,the divide,"this book is Elizabeth Key's very own the divide. it is a extraordinary combination of fantasy and adventure.fantasy because most of the setting is in a backwards world, where myth is real and their myth is our reality. adventure because a boy named felix has a deadly heart disease and nothing in this world can save him to a promised very short life. but maybe in another world he may have some hope.this is the story of a young boy named felix, who has a life threatening heart disease, who discovers a backwards world and finds new friends,and new enemies and are on a quest to save his life before it's too late. but there is another problem...how does he get back? i dearly love this book ""the Divide"", book 1 of a fantasic triligy. i really hope you love this book as much as i did. also look for:""Back to the Divide"" and ""Jinx on the Divide"""
4,the divide book is gooood!!!,"The book is really good. It is about a boy named Felix. He is thirteen years old and has a rare heart disease. He takes a vacation in Costa Rica where he crosses the Divide. The book is about him tring to find a cure for his illness with his friends, an elf and a griffen. While he is finding a cure, he has to avoid his enemy, Snakeweed, a pixie. I suggest people that like fantasy books should read this book."
4,Good Book,"The Divide by Elizabeth Kay is a compelling book that kept my attention until the very end. The Divide is about the adventures of a boy that crosses into a maghical world when he goes on the Divide. This was a good book because of the plot, the format in which it was written, and it made a connection between what kids have read to them and our actual world. I give this book 4 out of 5 stars for the creativity and substance in it. This book would be enjoyed by people that enjoy fantasy books."
4,The only book of its type.,This book is the only bok that I have found that is a service manual for the xs Yamaha.
2,Yamaha XS 1100 Fours 1978-1981,For being a Service Manual I don't think it has a very good Electrical section.
3,Check receiver first,"These don't work for the type of connections my receiver has. I have an older receiever with just the box connections that you push the wire through the small hole and then close the clamp. These DO NOT fit in the small hole, and even if they did, the connections are so close the clips would touch. I wasn't going to let 40 dollars go to waste. I grinded down the connector ends to fit in the small holes in my receiver, then I plan on using electrical tape around them so they don't make contact with each other. Otherwise the only wire that will fit is like 16 g minimum. Crap receiever."
2,Dissapointed,I've found that wires easily come out of the plugs. The smooth slug used to compress the wires have poor grip. For some reason it seems the cap that is used to screw down onto the internal slug also easily becomes loose. I'm really disappointed and would not purchase again.
5,A Good Read,"I have several friends who are Rangers, since they are known to be 'the best of the best' I wanted to see what it took to earn that (trust me, THEY DO) and what is expected of them. Plus these guys can't often talk a lot about what they do, so I figured learning about what they train for may give insight. This book did all of that. It goes day by day and shows the learning process-including the intentional stresses added to force the most out of them in the worst conditions. Plus, he also gives good history/added info on the schooling and Rangers as a whole. If you like to learn more about the military mentality and what all goes into it, its a fun read. Rangers Lead The Way!!"
1,Havent seen this but......,I havent seen this show although i would like to but living in England means i dont get to. I recently bought the fan made dvd collection of every episode including the other side of fear and faces of fear shows after seeing the two episodes of the show that were shown in Britain. The show FEAR is really amazing i loved it (there is a petition to try and get MTV to make more episodes at http://www.petitionspot.com/petitions/fear ) I suggest anyone who has not seen this show should get hold of a copy of pretty much any episode and anyone who has to sign the petition to bring the greatest show ever back!
5,Must Own!,This DVD is great. It has all of the dare that the people could really feel the spirits. it had the people that did the dare talk about what was going on. It was really cool knowing what was going on in their minds. Over all it is one of the best DVDs I known.
3,Count Bellesarious,It is a bit dated in style but does give an interesting accounting of early Rome - the battles and political struggles.
3,"get ""Rising Tide"" instead","There's nothing wrong with this book. It's a good book. But it pales beside a great book, John Barry's ""Rising Tide,"" that covers much of the same material in greater depth, is infinitely better written, and which this book seems to have borrowed from. Kelman does give more of the early history than does Barry, as well as more about such things things as yellow fever. From an acadmeic perspective re: the geography of New Orleans, Richard Campanella's work is better also."
5,DYNAMITE ADVICE TO HELP SMALL TOWNS PROSPER!,"Schultz is on the cutting edge of America's future. In Boomtown USA he does an extraordinary job of detailing how small towns can find their uniqueness, create jobs, and attract new residents or visitors. This book is a ""must read"" for any town official or private citizen who wants to make a difference and see their community prosper. And his list of the top 100 ""Agurbs"" is insightful, thoroughly researched, and invaluable for targeting forward-thinking communities.""Marilyn Ross, author of the forthcoming MICROPOLITAN MOVES: Advice for a Safe and Successful Relocation - or Buying Your Second Home Dream Retreat - in Small Town USA"
3,A good read,"A good read, with lots of great stories. Being 2013, it's slightly dated for all the things that have happened since publication, but still some great stories and examples."
3,Attractive But Marginally Functional,"Nicely constucted cosmetically, this case possesses undeniable class. Unfortunately, the interior design is ill-conceived.This case opens to about 225 degrees, meaning the open wing will point downward to the floor. The spring clip holding the cigarettes in the case isn't strong enough to secure its contents, which will fall to one's feet from simple gravity unless care is taken to hold the wings of the case level.Should I ever feel need to walk around and light cigarettes with undeniable class and to demonstrate my sense of geometric perfection by holding an open case parallel to the ground, I might be motivated to become accustomed to this. Until then, it will suffice to use my old $5 stainless steel case, which opens to 45 degrees, and can be turned upside down and shaken without having cigarettes fall to the floor"
1,Not accurate,After changing lifestyle and diet we wanted an affordable way to monitor health benefits so we ordered several of these. They weren't even close to accurate for two of us and on both occasions overestimated by about 50 points.Not worth the purchase.
2,uninformed,"thought that a test kit was a kit.. a complete package with everything you needed for the test. But it isn't. You need some kind of testing device, and you use the kit with it. I was totally uninformed and wasted my money. Just gonna throw it it the trash."
2,Disappointed,"This DVD demonstrated using a paint product that is in a tube with a tip and you squeeze it on your painting. I didn't care for the look it creates, to me it looks very sloppy. Plus, I don't think those paints are even available any longer."
4,Phillies World Series Years,"The Phillies have been in existence for 123 years and have only made four World Series appearances, so this DVD is something of an anathema for a Phillie fans. It is both sweet and bittersweet as it celebrates their greatest successes, especially the 1980 championship, but also magnifies the futility of the team (the Marlins have been a team for only ten years yet have won one more title than the Phils). That being said, this is a fine encapsulation of the championship years. It would great if they would release a dvd of the complete 1980 World Series as it was a classic series and would a must own for any fan of the team."
2,Not What You Expect,"The label fooled me: these are not the games. These are truncated highlights.Additionally, Major League Baseball, in their typically obnoxious in-your-face ways, have inserted their large logo onto the top right of the screen. It is extremely annoying and makes for a constant distraction. The games float around while the logo remains still - sticks out like a sore thumb. The good thing is that it cements in your mind that the MLB monopoly is worthy of contempt."
1,Did not arrive in time & not needed for Italy,"I bought this item because I was going to Ialy. The product did not arrive on time and therefore I returned it when I returned from my trip.I ended purchasing a converter in Paris for 3.70 euros. This converter worked perfectly in both France **and** Italy. My advice - if you are pushed for time, just buy whatever you need when you arrive in Europe. It's cheaper; you know it will work; *and* there is no hassle."
5,If you need a little more depth...,"If you want to mount a switch that is a little too deep for this bracket, get some M5-.8 screws (25mm to 50mm long depending on how much more space you need in the back) and nuts and use them to make a standoff for your switch. Those are metric sizes, but I found them at my local Home Depot in packs of twos for less than a dollar. If you have difficulty finding the metric sizes, you might get away with #10-32 screws, but I tried them, and it's not a perfect fit and found them to be too loose in the bracket's screw holes.Update: pictures of the standoffs are up now. One picture is from below and you can see the right angle cord in the back. The other is from the side. It looks a little crooked because I think I took the picture before I leveled it."
3,"Good Quality, not very deep","This patch panel bracket has very good construction and the hinges are useful to have. The only problem I ran into was mounting a 24 port switch with the patch panel as the mount is not that deep and I was barely able to fit that power cable (has to use a 90 degree power cable). 3/5 because with larger gear, this mount would not have worked. Otherwise its good. Just check your device depths prior to ordering."
5,excellent beginner's dvd for small boat sailing,"It seems that the DVD is converted from VHS video. This is a great dvd for beginners, especially for people who have no sailing or very limited sailing experiences. The basic skills of sailing such as tack and jibe were demonstrated well. I especially like the part of the Commordore's demonstration with a model boat, which conveys the concepts of sailing very well. One of the shortcoming of this dvd that I noticed was it was only 27 minutes 20 second long."
3,For Beginners Only,This is a cute little tape for beginner sailers and great for teenagers. If you know anything at all about sailing you might find it a little to easy. Strictly for beginners.
5,You Will Not Be Disappointed!,"I attended a conference where one of the authors was present and she was wonderful. The authors are sisters and they have indeed been personally touched by ASD.This book is highly recommended if you are an educator, a parent, or family member, who is curious and caring enough to learn the ins and outs of Autism Spectrum Disorder. This book just about covers everything."
5,Etiquette for the Average Joe,"A friend of mine loaned me this book and I immediately thought that this could easily be a Jim Carrey movie in an ""Office Space"" environment. The writing is good and fresh and have since loaned it to my son. I would recommend every parent giving it to their child as their entry into being a teenager. With luck, it could also be a great film!"
4,Burn notice torture,"Burn notice is such torture, I like to wait til it comes out(season on DVD) and I can watch them all in a couple days in a row. This goes for Supernatural as well."
4,Burn notice season 1-2,I just can't get enough of burn notice! I had to reserve season 3 to be the first to receive this hit series!
5,Burn Notice - Don't miss it!,Burn Notice is by far the best show on tv. Season 1 is fantastic! Every show is solid! Season 2 has some weak episodes but over all it's still excellent. Season 3 has just started and so far every single episode is great! I could watch all of the shows over and over and over again.
5,burn notice,perfect condition season 1 & 2 of burn notice fast shipment and wonderful service thanks!
2,"starts off okay enough and then,","Teri Denine's first novel 'Pocket Fill of Posies' started off okay enough, but then it sizzles, I do believe this new writer does show some ability so I will wait and see what happens in her next few efforts."
2,The beast,what i thought about the book the beast was it had some boring parts in the first few chapters. I do not recomend this book because it wasnt even exiting. if you want an action book this is not the book for you.Its about a guy named anthony witherspoon and hes going to collage and he meats a girl named gabi.this is not a action book.
3,Didn't live up to its promise,"This could have been an amazing, powerful novel. Walter Dean Myers portrays life on the streets in vivid detail, and the affection between Spoon and Gabi is convincing and compelling. However, the novel lacks focus. Supposedly this is the story of Spoon's battle to help Gabi overcome her drug addiction, but there's so much going on in these pages that Gabi feels like one of many subplots. We never really get to know or care for the characters as we should. There really isn't much of a struggle - despite the ambiguity of the end, Gabi's journey seems too facile and contrived. Spoon seems to spend as much time hanging out with his rich-kid friends as he does caring for Gabi. It's a pity that this novel doesn't live up to its rich promise, because there are some moments of beauty along the way that will leave you breathless."
2,return my time,"Review by Teenager:This book The Beast was an interesting read but only that. I gave one of the stars for originality, another for control/unpredictability.I took one away because there were too many parts that were unordered and unclear. For instance, ""Rafe was gang banging' last night."" You're left with only that about Rafe the whole book and it didn't relate to the conversation at that point. I took another star away for a weak ending. The ending in this book makes you want your 4 1/2 hours back that you spent reading it! The ending seemed like the author ran out of ink so he stopped writing and called it good but that's' not what writing is about. The last star was taken away for poor story plotting. The book could've been great if the author had given a background to the characters lives and made us connect to the characters before there was drama thrown in. This book had great potential but just like a bombed test this particular book failed"
5,Fantastic,"This is a great perfume! If I were to have just one, it would be this. Not too stong, smells fabulous."
4,found it,I bought this a few years back in chicago and was very happy to find it on here. i will diffinately be buying it again when i need more
3,Burberry London Parfum Spray,"A little strong smelling but nice. Doesn't smell anything like Burberry which is more of a softer scent which I prefer more than Burberry London. I have tried Burberry Brit and Burberry. Prefer in this order Burberry, Burberry Brit and London last."
1,Buyer Beware!,"Beware of ordering from this company. I ordered 2 bottles of what I thought was parfum because thedescription next to the picture just says ""Burberry Burberry London"" not disclosing that it was justover priced shower gel. I immediately tried to cancel my order and wonder of wonders, they have a""NO CANCELLATION"" plan when you place an order. I called Amazon directly, and they couldn't even getit to cancell. I give Amazon 5 stars for trying, and I wish I could give Burberry less than 1 star forbeing so deceptive to not accept immediate cancellation orders. BTW, if you notice mostof the great reviews are for the parfum, not the shower gel. (look at the small print)Plus it really doesn't have much of the advertised scent. The parfum itself smells great, I just won'tbe buying from this company ever again!"
5,Perfect for private instructors,"I run a small school of music and created a competition for local piano students. Our competition is broken down into skill levels and this book is my ""go-to"" when determining the skill level of the pieces performed. It's a perfect reference for me to consult when students are registering for the competition and there are pieces I am less familiar with.While not every piece ever written is included, I do feel it is very comprehensive and rarely have to search outside sources, except of course in the case of current contemporary lit. for obvious reasons."
5,Excellent resource for Adult Hobbyist,Not just a teacher's resource. This book is very helpful for the adult amateur (to early advanced standing) searching for new pieces to explore. Nicely arranged by musical periods. A nice complement to Maurice Hinson's Guide to the Pianist's Repertoire (which does list advanced works).
4,The book is very good but it is not self contained,"I enjoyed the last chapters of the book, that are relative to the applications: differential geometry, Fourier series, Fourier transform, differential equations.Also I think that the study of the convergence of Fourier series partially based on the notion of delta-like sequences of functions is very interesting and possibly it enables some generalizations.However the book is not self-contained because it does very much references to 'Linear Algebra' and 'Elementary Real and Complex Analysis' of the author."
2,Too many references,"Author refers to himself a lot, with references to this volume and to a previous volume. If you enjoy searching for section 5.4.3.2 (formula 7) to understand what he's saying in the current context, then this book is for you. Background acquired elsewehere? No problem. If you don't have his Volume I, be sure to buy that too because without it you won't make all the connections. By analogy, this is written like a web application that has many hyperlink references, some of them to pages that are not accessible. Unlike a web app, you are the search engine."
4,An engrossing book of hardships and depth.,"Jackson Watt is one of the most lovable characters I've read about. His realistic hardships and attitude in life, makes him believable. This book was completely worth my while to read. The characters' individuality was interesting. I reccommend that any teenager or young adult read this book."
4,Good Overview,"This is a good overview of Smith's fiction, treating the various story cycles and recurrent themes in his work. Nothing very deep here, but it's the only such treatment around."
4,Aurora Teagarden,Fun read. Love the humor and characters. Looking forward to reading more of the series and from this author. I really enjoy the 'cozy' style mysteries.
5,Love it!!,This was one of my favorite Aurora Teagarden books. They just keep getting better! If only they were as hot as the Sookie Stackhouse books.....
4,JULIUS FAMILY - WHERE ARE YOU?,"Aurora is finally married. Martin Bartell, her new husband, is a very secretive person and he brings in Shelby and his wife Angel to protect Aurora when he is not there. He buys the Julius House for Aurora as a wedding present and gives her free rein on renovations. Six years ago the former owners of the Julius House just disappeared - most folks find it eerie that Roe wants to live there; however, she loves the house and the way it feels to her. Roe and Angel embark on a quest to find the missing three Julius family members."
4,Good but it's different than other series.,"I like this whole series a lot, and I read them after I read Sookie, then Harper Connelly. So, it was my third series to tackle and I could see that Charlaine has grown a lot as an author, but this is a true mystery book, so it is way different than the Sookie books. I found that Aurora's character is getting more and more interesting as the series goes on, and in this particular book, I have to say it was a nice read. I'd recommend this book, but read them in order or they'll be confusing! This particular book is about a house that a family was murdered/missing from, and Aurora gets the house as a gift, and refinishes it. She solves the mystery accidentally, like always. It's a good relaxing read. Much lighter than the Sookie or Harper books."
4,Julius House,"This is my favorite Aurora Teagarden book so far. She is in love and very happy. Her fiance buys her a house for an engagement present. The house is one that has a local mystery attached to it. Aurora starts to dig into the past to find out what happened to the family who lived in the house before she acquired it. Along with that mystery, she is beginning to have some doubts about her fiance. Is he the hard working business executive she fell in love with? A very good read."
5,A Surprise,"The first few pages of this book bored me a bit, but boy am I glad that I stayed with it. This is the best Teagarden book so far. It is complex and takes surprising twists and turns not seen in this series before. Charlayne Harris is a terrific writer. All of series are great. I can't imagine that this book will disappoint. If the first few pages do, stick it out."
3,Cozy with a dark side,"In the fourth book of this series, Roe Teagarden marries her handsome businessman boyfriend, Martin Bartell. He buys her a house she has admired which once housed a family who mysteriously disappeared. During the course of the story, Roe discovers the mystery of the Julius family as well as some rather unsavory things about her husband. This book is not as fun as the earlier books of the series and her marriage seems contrived as Martin and Roe seem to have little in common other than a physical attraction."
1,The Beginning of the End,"This was the final Aurora Teagarden mystery that I read, and it was for the same reason that I stopped reading the Harper Connelly mysteries. The first few of this series were entertaining enough, but eventually I couldn't get past the fact that Roe was just a plain, boring person who found herself in ridiculous situations. She's a very one dimensional character with few redeeming qualities except that she's graceful when confronted by the absurdity of her name. A joke that gets old quickly.Though I don't know who came first, Sookie, Roe or Harper. But it feels as if Harris created Sookie, and thought to herself, ""Well this is going well, let's see what else I can do!"" and created the other two, who paled in comparison."
3,"Enjoyable, but...","Aurora gets married and moves into the Julius house with her new husband. Out of sheer boredom she takes on a case of the former house owners' mysterious disappearance and (you guessed it), she solves it!While I liked Charlaine Harris' writing style and enjoyed the mystery case, there was something out of place in this book. I think the story line about Aurora's husband's dark dealings was really overdone and felt very foreign to the small-town feel of the entire series.I hope Ms. Harris will be able to abandon this unnecessary ""twist"" in her future Aurora Teagarden mysteries books and come back to the cozy feel of her previous creations."
5,Roe Teagarden is Great!,"I had read all the Aurora Teagarden books with the exception of this title. I picked up last week and read it in an afternoon. The mystery keeps you guessing until the end. It's a great, quick read, as are all the Roe Teagarden books!"
1,White Men are Evil.,"This book goes to the heart of what is wrong with this country. I am an adult (40+) taking college classes online. This book is poorly printed; try highlighting and the ink smears. Also, the author repeatedly quotes studies conducted by her favorite researcher; HERSELF!!! The author is a Professor (I assume with tenure) at a university in San Francisco. BOOK SUMMARY: White men (excuse me, Euro-American males) are evil. Republicans hate minorities and poor people. If you send your children to college, you should read this book. As managers, we should have different standards for each individual based on their race and sex as we are all different and should all be granted ""special"" consideration. This book hurts legitimate diversity programs. Ridiculous drivel!!!"
2,Not recommended,"If you're buying this book you probably don't have a choice because it's a required text for your class. However, it is full of grammar errors and punctuation mistakes. It also appears very one-sided on some issues. If you can help it, don't buy it."
5,Great buy!,"This is a complete review of multicultural organizations, very useful for MBA students. The delivery was as expected and the book met all my needs."
4,Will buy again.,"I bought the book new. I recieved it in four days. It was in perfect condition. Although the book is rather dry, that is not the fault of the vendor. I will continue to buy text books using Amazon. The prices are 40-70% less than the school bookstore."
1,This book is racist,This book is racist. It makes many unsubstantiated claims concerning European-Americans. The book stereotypes all whites and ignores the all persuasive element of non-white crime that is destroying America's cities.
5,Changing and Growing through SANDPLAY,"I am a licensed clinical social worker with a teen drug and alcohol residential program. Here is a source book on symbolism and a guide to another language that these children, and the child in all of us, can use to work through the pain of childhood traumas.SANDPLAY is a bridge over the shame or self-conciousness of art therapy. I believe it will be productive for clients searching for a deeper meaning to their life, other than drug or alcohol use. I know their struggle demands change and growth. I know they are kinesthetic learners open to symbolism and eager to be relieved of burdens as well as to define order to their lives.I am using this book as a guide first to an understanding my own metaphors by developing a sand tray for myself. I have been yearning to do this for years. Now, here is a practical and positive guide. I think it will enrich me and also my clients. Thanks, Susan McNally."
3,Distracted by grammar/punctuation errors!!,"I'm glad to see there are some good reviews of this book, because I was beginning to question its authenticity due to the HUGE number of typos and punctuation/grammar/spelling errors! Has no one else noticed this??? My version is from 2001 and was published by [...]. If I were the author of this book I would be absolutely mortified to have my name on it, w/ the lack of quality editing. I'm hopeful that at least the content is accurate and will be helpful as I navigate sandtray sessions with my elementary school students."
4,Convenient and compact,"Rollers heat up nicely, although the color dot which indicates readiness never changes color. The unit heats up more quickly than the instructions state.The rollers are a bit smaller than I would like but they do a good job of curling hair quickly and the curl holds well."
2,MELTED!,"These were a Christmas gift a year ago. I have fine, very straight, shoulder-length, highlighted, layered hair. These rollers worked great in curling my hair. Now I use heavy hairspray and always have so don't know if the curl would hold without it - doubt it. Clips do leave a bit of a kink but it brushed out. THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE CURLERS GET TOO HOT TO HOLD AND THEN THEY MELTED! They get so hot I have to put a piece of tissue under the roller I use on my bangs! And they were sometimes too hot to hold. But, more importantly, they melted - I mean melted leaving part of the roller on the metal base! One melted so bad that I could not longer use it. With others, the edges got uneven so that they would catch in my hair. No on-off switch so had to unplug. If you forget, they don't turn off by themselves - this would be my recommendation."
5,great rollers!,I bought these curlers about three years ago and they've never let me down. I've had hair half way down my back and all the way up to my shoulders and they still make beautiful curls. What I like about these curlers the most is that they don't burn my fingers when I'm putting them in my hair. The curlers heat up fairly quickly and I only have to leave them in my hair about 15 minutes!
2,bought it and will now return it,"Well I was looking for a text to help me put some realistic looking clothing in a game I want to make. I don't think this is the right text. While it has many chapters on collision detection and even one on numerical integration, it seems to be high level, abstract and somewhat vague about implementation. There is absolutely no source code, just some pseudo pseudo code snippets. I have a feeling I could find info more useful to me on the web in Siggraph proceedings. This book seems to be meant for fashion designers who want to use the computer to see what their clothing would look like before hiring a seamstress and a supermodel."
2,This is silk?,"I have satin pajamas and I love them (Intimo). These were the same size as my satins but were too tight in the chrst and stomach. The pants were way too long. I don't like knocking anything, but I can't give a positive erview on this product. Sorry..."
3,confortable but not durable,I have been using it most days of the last 3 months. It's comfortable but one of the pant buttons already fell. I think it will not last long before it unravels.
1,Sent wrong item,You sent me the wrong one. I got the one with the laundry bags only. I just haven't sent it back yet. I wish you would have sent us the one in the picture. The box is sitting in my tech room. I think you should go through the problem of picking it up and sending me the correct one. I am unable to do so at this time. I already have the one in the picture and just figured out how to tightened it up.
5,Great Oil,"We love this oil. It has a really good taste and we use it more than any of the other oil that we have. The bottle is a bit large, so we pour some out of this bottle into a smaller glass bottle. We have already purchsed more as we used up our first gallon."
1,Not what it says it is!,"I purchased this based on the name, Bragg. I have always trusted this company and what they stood for. However lately I have put my store bought olive oil to the refrigerator test and it failed to solidify. So I bought the Bragg brand and much to my dismay it does not pass the test! It does not harden or thicken at all in the refrigerator! I contacted the company via e-mail on their web-site and conveyed my concerns but they did not respond at all. I am sorely disappointed and will not buy again."
4,Not as fluffy as I thought. . .,"Amazing turn around. I got it within 2 days of placing the order! Five stars for shipping. I ordered the firm one thinking it would be more stuffed. It isn't, but I don't know whether it will fluff up more with time as it was compressed for shipping. That being said, it is a very nice product! It came with a great high quality zippered cover for the pillow which is one less thing to buy for the pillow! Love that it is long so that you can wrap your legs around it and still be able to use it to support your head. . . My sons both tried to take it from me so that tells you have comfy it is!"
1,"Flat, of course","I have to agree with Maggie Marie here - this ""pillow is a joke""! Perhaps 2 inches flat and not firm at all.I suppose that the quality is very inconsistent... Some people seem ecstatic about it and other - like me - simply hate it.I think that the pillow from the photo uses the material from 2 to 3 pillows; the one I got seems malnourished."
3,"Ok, but Kinda Stinky","I was so excited about the pillow. As soon as I got it, I washed the pillow case it came with so I would be able to use it that night. So at night I set it across the bed so it would be support for my other pillows. Because as we all know feather pillows go flat. Well it smelled funny. I didn't know why. My other feather pillows I bought at Costco didn't have this problem. At first, I thought it was just me, but no other people have told me it stinks. SO beware of this pillow. It is made in china and I don't know if that is the problem."
2,Feathers stick out even with cover on,"I would like this pillow if the feathers didn't stick out all over the place. The feathers stick out and scratch my skin even with the pillow case on. I find this odd since I have a down pillow for my head and the feathers never stick out. I can't figure out if its poorly made or if it needs to be covered with 2 pillow cases. I sent an e-mail to Amazon.com asking to return the pillow and Amazon sent me an e-mail back saying that they were trying to contact the seller. I never heard back from them, so I guess that I'm stuck with this pillow and with the feathers."
5,The Supplied Life by Bill Freeman,"The power of the Cross is ""supplied"" daily in this wonderful reading. A must have for daily devotional. Sing Jesus!"
2,more about the Coens than the film,"The Big Lebowski is my all-time favorite movie; I bought this book hoping to read lengthy interviews with the cast, see behind-the-scenes photos and stills from the film, etc. Instead, this book deals with the technicalities of the Coen brothers' film making in general, with The Big Lebowski only serving as the most-often referenced case-in-point. So I'd say read this if you're interested in the Coens' film making technique, but if you're interested in The Big Lebowski specifically you won't really find much here."
5,A gorgeous book...,"A surprising, gorgeous find! I love everything about this book. The style and the characterizations of Holmes and Watson felt perfect. They broke my heart several times throughout the book. The ending was beautiful. I'll definitely re-read this one many times."
4,I liked it.,"An interesting spin on the relationship between Sherlock Holmes and John Watson. What if their friendship was deeper than just friends? In this story, Watson is completely in love with Holmes but Holmes just cannot seem to return his feelings. Holmes does care and love for Watson but he does not know how to show these deeper emotions. They find out how to deal with these emotions in ""The Final Problem' which is more about their relationship than the mystery. If you are wanting a sweet mystery with genius deductions, this is not the story for you. But, if you're interested in the interaction between the two characters, it's an interesting read."
1,Rated as a -10 !!!,This is the worst Holmes book EVER written...Nothing else could come close....A terrible waste of time and $$$$$...This author has DEEP problems....
3,Baby Pleaser,"This book may seem simplistic to adults. There is no narrative, and it jumps from north pole to south pole without any notice! My six-month old son, however, loves it. He chuckles out loud, repeatedly, at the appearing and disappearing penguins and polar bears. Unfortunately, he also managed to rip off the snowman's arm. I would recommend this book, though I feel it could be sturdier. When your child is older, you can always point to the globe, and show him where those polar bears and penguins actually live."
4,Un clásico imperdible,"Es uno de los clásicos de la literatura latinoamericana. Es un autor que con precisas y directas descripciones del la psicología de los personajes y del entorno en que viven, produce sobresaltos al lector con los desenlaces. En este sentido, se es un adelantado respecto a la literatura de su tiempo, tal como lo fue, por ejemplo, Pablo Palacio en Ecuador. Recomendado desde todo punto de vista."
3,Excelente redacción.,"OBRAS MUY ENTRETENIDAS. ALGUNAS CON BUENA FANTASÍA, OTRAS CON DOSIS SUFICIENTE DE BUEN AMOR.RECOMENDABLE PARA ESTUDIANTES MAYORES DE 10 AÑOS, PARA Q SE AFANEN EN LA LECTURA, DESARROLLEN LA BUENA ORTOGRAFÍA, Y ENGRANDEZCAN SU VOCABULARIO."
2,Orthography Massacre!,"I just clicked on the ""Look Inside!"" icon, revealing a way-with-words so unique to Quiroga massacred by complete carelessness. I am able to find at least 2 errors per page; unfortunately that is enough to make me stop reading at the fourth page. I suggest you look elsewhere, which is what I will do. It's infuriating when ""meses"" gets turned into ""mesas"", and the vivid palette of images becomes blurred because ""four months ago"" simply cannot be replaced with ""four tables ago""."
5,The most unsettling...,La gallina degollada is the most unsettling short story I have ever read. It may have something to do with having an 18 month old child at the time that I first read the story. It takes us through a horror that makes one feel that the author has crossed the line and dragged us across with him. I still want to read the other stories in this collection.
3,The spanish is sort of difficult to understand....,"i thought it was a good book. i bought it for a spanish class assignment, and was not disappointed in reading it. horacio quiroga is a very passionate (and somewhat mysterious) author, and i enjoyed reading his work. :)"
3,Impresión extraña,"Algunos de los cuentos son excelentes, pero otros son raros, con bastantes toques de humor negro y morbosidad. Un buen libro que leeria no dos veces"
5,Cuentos de Amor de Locura y de Muerte,"Recomiendo la lectura de los cuentos de Horacio Quiroga, sobretodo a las personas que gustan del genero del cuento, como a mi. Es una gran oportunidad para tenerlo en esta edicion virtual."
4,Muy bueno.,"Recordaba muchos de los cuentos de la época de la escuela, un clásico en un nuevo formato.Y aparte gratis.Excelente. Llévenlo y disfrútenlo, vale la pena."
5,Toque unico!!,"Horacio Quiroga es uno de los pocos autores que da imagenes tan vividas de la realidad, con un toque de ironia, un poco de crueldad, cinismo, y realidad al gusto el autor logra, por medio de cuentos con toque Americano, dar una vision impresionante y poderosa de la literatura Sur Americana, este autor, junto con otros de la literatura Hispano Americana, como Pocaterra, logran llevar en alto a la literatura Criolla, al leer sus cuentos, el autor, de cualquier edad, recuerda, vive y sufre estos relatos. La utilizacion de el cinismo y la crueldad de Quiroga puede llegar a ser tan placentera que llega a convertirse en dulzura, Dulzura que solo este autor, sumergido en tragedias y eventos tragicos pudo alcanzar en su vida."
5,"Cuentos de amor , de locura y muerte spanish review.","Horacio Quiroga fue uno de los grandes que todavía repercute entre los aficionados a la literatura. cuentos de amor locura y muerte es un libro espectacular ,de dramatismo fantástico que llega a un punto de sutil crueldad. Para el que lee estos relatos la experiencia es inolvidable. A mí particularmente me parece excelente esta colección de cuentos y siempre será uno de los libros que volveré a leer hasta que me lo sepa de memoria."
4,"Cuentos de amor, locura, y muerte","Estas colleciones del autor Quiroga son algunas de sus mejores obras. Siempre me han gustado sus cuentos, su manera de escribir, y sus temas como la muerte, el amor (imposible), y la locura. Esta colleción discute un poco de cada tema. También discute la vida difícil del hombre en la selva, o sea, el hombre contra la naturaleza. Creo que los temas mencionados vienen de su propia vida cuando Quiroga era joven; El fue testigo de los dificultades de la vida en el bosque que confrontan al hombre. Sin duda, estos cuentos son muy interesantes y fenómenos; le muestran al lector ""la vida cruel"" en que vivía el autor Quiroga."
5,You'll fall in love with this guy!,"Dang it. I don't know how to write reviews.All I know is I liked Poe Ballantine's writing immediately. He is funny as hell, brilliant, honest...different. Give him a try, you won't be disappointed!"
4,Nice Little Book,"Starts with 4 noble truths. Proceeds with a few pithy and some banal Zen and Taoist aphorisms. However, (from the book) ""For those with preferences, suffering is inevitable"" So, I give it 4 stars."
3,MY GRADE: B minus to B.,"Matt Murdock is called out to a podunk town named Redemption in order to see whether a teenager accused of murder really did it and like a lot of these small towns they hide secrets of their own. Unlike most Daredevil pieces this focuses more on the case and very little on Daredevil in action. Some have expressed their wish that this be a 100% Murdock the lawyer story but that didn't happen.Artwork is somewhat good to good with a lot of shadow play. Lots of focuses on the character heads as they speak and such. Some might call it severe.There are strong themes of child abuse in this piece so steer clear if that bothers you. Based on a true tale, West Memphis Three.Written by David Hine. Artwork by Michael Gydos and coloring by Lee Loughridge.ARTWORK PRESENATION: B minus to B; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B; STORY/PLOTTING: B minus; WHEN READ: end of October 2012; OVERALL GRADE: B minus to B."
2,Didn't like print,"The shirt was of good quality but the print is not the typical camouflage, but something that looks like it was done on a computer."
1,NOT FOR KEYBOARD,"I purchased this book for piano bc it says ""For Keyboard - Guitar - Vocal"" on the front cover. This book is NOT for keyboard/piano. The book is about the size of a 4x6 index card, and all of the songs are right hand only. Very disappointed bc I liked the songs. I am sure it would be great for vocal or guitar."
1,Not easily read,"This book is the same size and bound the same as most paperback novels. The book has great songs in it, but it is very difficult to read while playing."
4,AWSOME BOOK,Hello there childrens! This book is good for guitarists of all ages (EVEN YOU GRANNY!) It is so much fun to play your own guitar and have the same thing in your stereo. It is fun for the whole family (SCRUFY) Next time you need a book on on guitar get this one and say WASSUPPPPPPPPPPP!
4,Marie,These plates are really pretty and the details are great. They look really nice hanging above my windows in my dinning room.Marie
3,Not the best...,"Mr. Moroney can certainly play the instrument well enough, but there are far better performances and recordings of 1080 than this one. I love Bach and his Fugue's so I have a couple of versions, string, horns, organ, harpsichord, etc. Aside form the recording flubs (background noises) throughout this album, my major disagreement is that some of the more delicate phrases are poorly executed. They seem jerky, and do not ring in a manner befitting the piece. This may be his interpretation, but I find it unpleasant. The harpsichord is an ideal instrument for 1080, and Mr. Moroney is probably capable of really playing it well, but this recording falls short. It may be worth getting to hear his attempt at completing contrapunctus 14, but if you are looking for solid Die Kunst Der Fuge, I would keep looking."
1,Guide? It's a wood dictionary!,"As a Middle School and High School Woodshop Teacher, I can tell you that this book does a good job of defining wooworking terms. However, it provides no how-to information. For example, if you would like to know about a biscuit joiner and the joints it creates, all you will find is a verbal description of what it is and a drawing of the joint that looks more like a mortise and tenon than a biscuit joint. Biscuit joinery is not clearly depicted pictorially and there is certainly no information about when to use them, how to use them, or how to do them. Need a wood dictionary? Buy this book. Need a how-to guide for woodworking? Buy something else."
3,Not for the Kindle,"I will tailor this review solely for any fellow Kindle lovers who're interested in woodworking. I'm new to woodworking as a hobby and needed something very basic.This book fits the bill, but having compared it to the print version, it simply does not work on the Kindle.So, if you're looking for a well-written book on basic woodwork, purchase the dead-trees edition, not the electronic one."
5,boston acoustics cr65 speakers,"The seller was great to work with, very fast shipment and great price. will buy from seller again!"
2,Don't bother,"I bought these for my grandson because I thought they would be fun in the bathtub, but none of them worked. They don't whistl and they just sink in the tub"
3,Welded connections are not very strong,"This is an okay sorter as long as you don't put anything heavy in it. The welded sides have broken off of mine. You also have to continually tighten the screws on the rest of the sorter to keep it tight and sturdy, so if you get it keep the allen wrench it comes with close at hand. The bottom shelf just lays in and can pop off when you roll it around so that it can scratch you ankle rather badly. This item did last longer than the pvc pipe version I had but still has problems and I am currently looking for another that is more sturdy, less maintenance and better construction."
5,Does the trick,"In comparison to what I read about other laundry carts, I find this one to be of good quality and substantial enough for my needs. I found it very easy to put together. Tip: put the top shelf in before you tighten the screws on the sides. OK...I'm not Martha Stewart. Overall, this is a nice laundry cart. The bags are a good size...hold a lot, and are very thick canvas. I recommend this."
5,very comfy,I bought the black leather one and its just what I needed. Its large and very comfy. I hope it doesn't start to sag after a few months like what the other reviewer said. Definitely worth the $35 I paid for it.
2,"Not what I thought, but will work","I expected something a little more substantial. I wanted them for our camping trailer so when you sat on sofa you could put your feet up. Bought 2. they are very light weight, and actually could almost throw them around like a big ball (which kids would probably do if they had them). I admit I needed something light weight, but when you put your feet on them, they roll around like a ball, so all in all I am not happy with them, but too much trouble to mail back so I will live with them. I'm really not sure what they would be good for?"
5,What can I say.,"A footstool is for one to rest their feen upon. I successfully rest my feet upon this device each night when I read, so I guess it serves it's function. Not at a point in my life whter I get excited or depressed about footstools."
3,Started out great,"I was absoltely in love with this item when I first got it. It was firm, yet cushiony. When I put my feet on it, they were at the perfect height. The problem is, after a few months of use, the bean bag is no longer firm. I think the faux leather stretches, resulting in the ""beans"" being less compressed. Now when I put my feet on it, the thing just sort of flattens out. I'll definitely have to replace it, because it is no longer comfortable.Another thing to consider is that the fauz leather does not breath at all. If you live in an area with warmer summers, this might not be the best choice."
1,"Poorly Made Zipper, Beans Everywhere!!!!!!!!!!!","I received this product on September 30th, today is October 8th and I have spent most of the morning vacuuming the styrofoam shaped beans that are inside of this bean bag. I thought (and hoped) it had become unzipped but upon further inspection I noticed that the zipper had spilt. The zipper is poorly made and if possible I would like a full refund or a replacement."
1,disappointment,"I returned the item, because it did not work for me. I got the impression from the description that this was like a a bean bag chair for your feet. Well it was not. It was hard with no give unlike a bean bag chair. I will say the leather was of good quality, but it not as advertised."
1,Anthony Oil-free Face Lotion SPF15,I thought this would be a good moisturizer for me because it was oil-free and had SPF15 in it. I live in Arizona and sunblock everday is a must. However I have oily skin and most moisturizers leave me with a shiny face. This one is no exception. I tried putting just a thin layer of the product on my skin and it left me with an oil slick look. I will not buy this one again.
3,it's ok,"This lotion is for normal to oily skin, it moisturize well but it gives very shiny look, so i don't recommand if your skin is already oily-shiny. Over all my impression is Anthony's products don't worth price."
5,Great for daily use,"As many males out there, I don't like anything oily on me, this product gets dry instantly and you feel the uv protection working on your face. The bottle last a lot, I'll buy another one for sure"
5,Husbands lotion,"I bought this for my husband because he gets really dry skin on his face and i was looking for something that would work. He not only uses this every morning, but i use it sometimes! AWESOME LOTION!"
1,contains paraben,"I had to search for a while on the net to find the ingredient list for this. They even hide it on the manufacturer's site. Parabens mimic estrogen in your body, use at your own risk."
5,FANTASTIC!!!,"FOR THOSE OF US WHO LOVE TO SEE HOW THE OTHER HALF ( OR RATHER 1%) LIVES!!!! A GREAT VIDEO! I TAPED IT ON DVD FROM A&E AND IT IS NOW BROKEN, I HAVE TO HAVE IT IN MY LIBRARY! TOTALLY LIFESTYLES OF THE RICH AND RICHER! YOU WONT BE DISAPOINTED!!!"
3,Gift,"I received this set as a gift, love the extra utensil that came with it, only complaint I have is the browning of the pans if left on high heat. It does not maintain that stainless steal look but great to cook in."
3,"Not bad, but not great","Received as a gift, purchased from Macys. Finish was somewhat rough inside which surprised me (especially compared to other sets of comparable price); cooked ok but things seemed to stick a little more than I like so I ended up returning it and am in the process of buying something else."
1,Don't waste you money!,"I received this set as a gift and I should have returned it to the store. Don't let the smooth shiny metal fool you, this was my mistake. I have tried everything with these and the only thing I found them useful is for boiling water. I read previous reviews about making sure they cook in low to medium heat to avoid any burning food or food stuck on the bottom of the pan, but nothing seems to work. My husband tried cooking breakfast and was browning sausage, you would that a fatty food with lots of oils would make it not stick to the pan, but this stuck on there same thing with bacon. We have given up on these. Not worth the hassles and clean up."
4,Unmatched ankle braces,"My 1 complaint is that we ordered a pair of ankle braces and they don't match!!!!!!!!! They sent 1 old style brace and 1 new, improved style of ankle brace. There's an orange strip down the back of one of the braces and no stripe down the other. Not that big of deal, but my daughter wears them and you know how girls are!!!!"
5,Strong and Stable,I recently sprained my right ankle (mild sprain) and after 2 weeks of rehabilitating it I wanted to get back into the Karate dojo. An unstable ankle in Karate is not a good thing.I searched for a robust ankle brace that would stabilize my ankle enough for me to get back to my practice. I was impatient and didn't want to wait for full recovery so my ankle was weak and still tender. I ended up buying the McDavid Ankle Brace with Straps.First let me say this isn't a Mickey Mouse foam brace. It is a substantial piece of support equipment and takes a few minutes to get on and off. It's excellent at supporting the ankle. I was very impressed at how much stability it provided me. I don't think I could sprain my ankle wearing this thing if I tried. I wore it over a sock but didn't try to put on a shoe. I used it in a Karate dojo so no shoes and it performed very well.I definately recommend this product.
5,Exactly as advertised,"Until I tried this product, there had never been an ankle brace that had anywhere near the effectiveness of getting taped by a trainer. It's also more comfortable than getting taped. I'm a size 12 shoe and the medium fits well. Hope this helps."
4,"Good support, but not great","There's so much Velcro on it that it gets tangled up in itself when you are trying to put it on or remove it, and if you don't put it back together when you are done with it, it will catch on (and ruin) everything it comes in contact with.It does give fair ankle support, and I definitely feel more stable (my problem is weak ankles, not an injury) when I'm wearing it than not, but still. I would wish for a little less side-to-side wobble.These are definitely sized for men. I'm an adult female with medium bone structure, and I'm in a Small."
5,Best ankle braces I have ever used.,This ankle brace is very well designed. It's light so you won't feel it once you're in he middle of your game or workout. I highly recommended
3,hard to put on and off!,it has a lot of shoe laces and it is hard to put on and off. I have a brace c plastic stays on the sides with gel protection and I feel that was more secure for my ankle . this one is thin and can be worn with shoes and it has very good quality material. it also has alot of velcro straps that collect cotton from your carpet or socks. You might like them.
5,Well Protected for My Ankle,"I hurt my ankle before I was so afraid to let my ankle get injury again. After I purchased this Ankle Brace, it protected me a lot when I played the basketball games in college. And I was appreciate this ankle to prevent me injury anymore."
3,Good but,"Good purchase but, I want it black and they send me a white one. But is a excellent choise for people who do any kind of sports."
3,wrong color,I orderd a BLACK medium Mcdaivd ankle with Strap but they sent me a wrong color product which is WHITE.
3,Didn't love it,"Found this to be pretty annoying to wear. A little bit of a pain to put on, but really not that big of a deal. After a few minutes of use I tend to forget about it, but I feel a little stiff and a little slower with the McDavid Ankle wrap on. If you have cronic ankle issues, I'd say this is worth the purchase. Provided solid support without completely prohibiting movement. I only needed this to help recover from an injury. Now that I'm back up to 100%....ankle brace is staying in the closet. I just don't like it enough to wear it as a preventative brace."
5,Awesome ankle support for basketball!,"I rolled my ankle when i landed on someone else's shoe while going up for a layup and ended up tearing my ligament and breaking a piece of bone. I took a few weeks off and when i came back my ankle felt weak and unstable. After doing some research, i found out that the ankle wraps with straps are the best, i bought this one and now i can confidently play basketball without fear of messing it up again. I actually like this so much that i am buying a second one for my other ankle so i dont roll it. The price is also amazing, sports authority sells the cheaper model for $36 before taxes."
5,Where have you been all my life.,"Since I busted up in a motorcycle accident I've had to wrap my ankle prior to any physical activity to avoid injury. This brace is a god sent. Easy to use, strong, durable and comfortable. Unless someone comes up with something better I'll never be without it."
2,Good support but the inside seams chafe too much.,"The inside seams are a bit too rough and chafe away my skin whenever I play. Hopefully, this is a exception and others don't experience this."
2,Do not get this if your ankle is still sore - only for post-injury,"If you are still experiencing pain from your ankle injury I would definitely not order this brace. You will not be able to put it on and if you somehow manage to get it on, getting it off will be even harder and more painful. This brace is designed for post injury wear only. I suggest a non-lacing brace."
2,too little support,"i had to return it because it provided too little support for my very weak ankle. it might be good for mderate weakness. also, it came in sizes but there was no directions to measure for correct size on order page (just on box it came in). supposed to be able to adjust it without removing shoe. velcro prevented this."
3,"Good support, but bulky","I sprained my ankle about four months ago, and once I was healed enough to play soccer again, I was having it taped. I spent so much in tape that I decided to purchase this brace instead. I spoke to the McDavid reps to figure out which brace I should buy for soccer, and this was the decision I came to, based on how it wraps around your ankle--much like the way I was having it taped.This brace does provide amazing support, but it is too bulky to wear with my shinguards. So I don't wear it often, unless I am out of tape and prewrap."
4,Beyond great,"I bought this set about three or four years ago and only used it for a few months in a drawing class. Since then, I stuck it in a drawer and almost forgot about it until recently. I've been using it to sketch and write for about a month now, and after 3ish years of no use all of the cartridges still flow like new. Not even a hint of reduced ink flow or uneven lines. I absolutely love this pen and would recommend it to anyone, but my only criticism is that the cap doesn't fit as snugly on the end of it as I would like. Every now and then it pops off if you're not careful, which can be a real hassle if you're in a public area. If they threaded the end of the pen like they did the tip, it would be perfect. So I'm only giving 4 stars because of the cap issue, but everything else is wonderful."
3,The winx review,"it has great cards with it that my daughter loved. She doesn't play the game but sits and looks at the pictures on the cards and loves them!! She is 12, maybe to old for the game but is in love with the winx faries themselfs."
5,Nobody Cares is still rockin',"Absolutely, this band has a great sound with an awesome horn section. They have not disbanded and still rock at various venues. Check out their new sounds at [...] you will not be disapointed with the new material. How you gonna manage when the kids from long beach is out to do damage!"
5,Urusei Yatsura at its finest,"This movie is based on the long-running series Urusri Yatsura, created by popular manga artist Rumiko Takahashi. The movie is very surreal, since the characters relive the same day everyday and time has seemed like it has stopped. You have to watch this movie more than once to fully understand."
4,Very weird...good for UY fans,"for some reason the end shocked me (forget what happened, but I know it shocked me) lots of scenes of all the UY teen gang hanging out, having fun, then theres some parts where everything is going by SO fast I have to rewind again and again and pause so I can stop and read the subtitles."
5,"Great anime, but make sure you watch it twice ^_-","Based on the popular Japanese anime series which ran during the 80s, this movie is a real treat. It's strength lies in its intricate (though somewhat confusing) plotline and colorful characters. The characters tend to be a rather obnoxious bunch, but even if you don't like this at first (I thought it made them all the funnier, myself), they *will* grow on you. If you enjoy this movie, make sure to check out the other UY movies and the TV series."
5,I think the hilarious comedy make this the best anime ever.,"First before you go and by this you should either see the first episode or read the first manga issue. Let me tell you that this is ultamitly the best of the Uruseigh Yatsura movies. the things that make this movie the best:Comedy,suspense and some romance."
5,An Anime Classic That Should Be Part Of Your DVD Collection,"This is one of the series that spawned the genre of today's anime. If you are looking for the wit and humor from the Land Of The Rising Sun, Ataru Moroboshi (the unluckiest guy around), Lum and all of their friends will not let you down. A must have in your collection."
4,my first zelda game,"I've never played a Zelda game, and this one is pretty fun. I'm used to moving characters with the joystick/pad, but moving with the stylus isn't that bad, actually. I paid $20, but I'm unsure if I would pay much more."
2,Meh...,"I really tried to like this game. But there's just too much backtracking involved. Throw a ship into the mix and you've got hours of tedious sailing too. Every time you go and find a hint or a clue you have to return to the main dungeon and go through the same things you've cleared before until you reach a lower level that was previously unaccessible. It gets very frustrating and just isn't that much fun. It hurts me to give a Zelda game a low rating, but this one wasn't good. At all."
2,One of the embarassments of the Zelda series,"This was a poorly made game. I felt cheated when I purchased it new the first time.That said, it wasn't all bad. The gameplay was not too bad when fighting. Sailing around was fun, but only at first. After a while, sailing got tedious, and sometimes outright annoying.This is Zelda, so it was worth playing. Don't pay too much for it, and you won't be too disappointed with it. If you pay over $15 for it, you are getting ripped off, (unless it is for a collection and in ""collectable"" condition)."
1,zelda,very bad game why because it is very hard to beat not many good features bad story line and bad caricatures
3,Good for those beggining,The legend of zelda phantom hourglass is an OK game. It used to be very fun and I would play it all the time but after I played another zelda game this just does not compare. First sailing around all the time is annoying but you get used to it (somewhat). Second there is not much dungeon exploreation since there is only one camera view. Third it is just annoying that you do not have thet many weapons (there are only about 8) Fourth alot of the game relies on drawing and tapping to solve puzzles. Also it would have been nice to use the buttons for something. If you are new to the zelda series this is a good game but if you play another game like Twilight Princess(AWESOME!!!!!) than don't be surprised if do not play this game that much.
2,A very meh title,"As others have said, this is a very mediocre, boring game. It has some interesting elements like utilizing the microphone feature and the way you use the boomerang, but that can't make up for the utter tedium of sailing around...and around...and around, or having to repeat the same temple floors over and over again. I played this game for several hours, and by the fourth time I had to go back and play the SAME temple floors again, I gave up. It's just not worth it. There is nothing exciting about this game, and very little that is dynamic.I'm glad I traded for this game instead of spending money on it, but I'd rather have the other game back."
4,Zelda review,this game is very good :) the navigations of link through the pen works really well and the game is fun to play. altough it is not that hard to defeat all the monsters and end bnosses
5,One of the Best Nintendo DS Games Ever!,"I was pleasently surprised when I started this game. You must free Zelda from the evil forces, she was turned into stone. In this game, you travel to all kinds of different islands with many different monsters and people to interact with. This version for the Nintendo DS is a great success, you can draw your paths, make notes and generally move around with the stylus. I always enjoyed playing the Zelda gamesx for the GBA, and this game is even better. There are all kinds of twists and you must help many people in order to locate Zelda. Not to mention: This game is extremely tricky and clever. I had trouble with most of the puzzles in this game! I really think that this game belongs in everybody's Nintendo DS collection, you shouldn't miss out on this one!"
5,good game and challenge!,my friend tell me about zelda so I bought it from circuit city also I ordering that guide book of zelda from amazon. wow that's good. some frusation and I try beat them grr game over I click continue then again over wow its tough. its chapter 2 now plenty of time save it. I love it. kill my time. I like that storyline. It's worth.
1,You call this non-linear?,The first zelda game i have ever played was ocarina of time when i was five years old. I continued to play until twilight princess which was very fun. I have beaten most of the zelda games so I decided I would buy it for my dsi. Little did I know this isn't even a zelda game. You have to keep going to the TOTOK (Temple of the Ocean King) for like sixty floors. It doesn't make any sense. As I got to the middle of the game the floors started getting timed and it was just pressuring and stupid. I decided I would return this and five months later a new sequel came out which was the spirit tracks. I took a risk and bought spirit tracks and boy was i happy. Spirit tracks is ten times better because the dungeons aren't timed and there is no TOTOK. IF YOU WANT TO BUY A GOOD ZELDA GAME FOR DS/DSI BUY SPIRIT TRACKS.
2,Huge dissapointment for a Zelda title,"Being a sequel to The Wind Waker, I expected alot more out of this game, sadly, it was a major flop. The story is as expected bad because your just chasing after to find out where Tetra is so you can turn her back to normal after being turned into stone. The sylus controls handle well however it would have been nice to have been able to use the d-pad and the reason why this game is bad is because they force you go through the same dungeon atleast 5 times, and you have to do the ENTIRE dungeon over again and more, also you have a time limit and have to complete it in usually less than 10 minutes which requires you to remember everything about it while avoiding invincible, yes, invincible enemies.If you werent forced to backtrack to many times, then this would easily be one of the best DS titles out there, unfortunately, it isnt."
5,Awesome,"It's lots and lots of fun, it's long so its worth every penny, but some parts are somewhat challenging, I had to break my head in some of them and I even had to go to the walkthrough, but I lOVED IT, it a game full of adventure, fighting, and puzzles, perfect"
5,Best DS game I've played!,"This game utilizes the DS to the best degree I have seen in any of the games I've played. I'm a male college student, so I don't know about all of the games for real young kids, but this game is the best I have played on the DS. The story line is a little bit simple, but definitely fits a Zelda game. The difficulty is moderate, but the main story line is easy enough to complete, because the most challenging objectives are in the optional mini-games that you can participate in.The only downside of the whole game is the ending. I could be biased due to the fact that I very rarely like endings to good games, because I want to keep playing, but I found the last boss fairly easy to defeat and the ending to be a little bit sub-par compared to the rest of the game. Still, not a horrible ending, and it doesn't change the fact that it is a 5 star rating and the best DS game I have played."
4,Very fun game in the Zelda series,"If you have ever played a Zelda game and enjoyed it, then I am sure you will enjoy The Phantom Hourglass. Touch screen controls take a little while to get used to, but once you do you'll find that they work very well and are fun to use. The graphics are very well done and don't effect the framerate or amount of content in the game.The only major complaint may be sailing is very tedious and the backtracking many times to this certain temple may get very old.Overall, still a very fun game"
5,The BEST game for the DS!!!,"I am not a Zelda fan. I have never played a Zelda game before trying it for the DS. For those of you who have never tried a Zelda game before, I absolutely recommend this game. It is amazing. By far the best game I have played on the DS to date. Even if you are not a Zelda fan, you will throughly enjoy this game. The touchscreen is used in very unique ways. JUST. BUY. IT."
4,Zelda is AWESOME!,"You try to defeat the ""bosses"" (evil creatures) to get more time in the hourglass so you can upgrade your ship and weapons. Graphics could be improved."
5,Another top game in the DS lineup!,"I'm a long time fan of the Zelda series, having owned every game except Twilight Princess for Wii. First off I must say the graphics are outstanding for such limited hardware specs are the DS. Its like playing Windwaker on a portable gaming system. The gameplay also stays faithful to its predecessor.At first I thought the requirement of the stylus throughout all gameplay would hinder the game. It actually makes it much easier to play especially in combat where you can simply point at an enemy instead of have to move your character all around. Another great use of the touchscreen is the fact that you can draw notes on maps so there is no need to memorize where things are located. This is invaluable particularly when in dungeons. Also drawing the path of the boomerang using the stylus makes it so much easier to target objects.The developers have made excellent use of the touchscreen. I always thought it was a simple gimmick but this game has proved me wrong."
3,"Not the best Zelda game, but still good!","I heard many people say this is a bad game, while I'll agree the ocean king temple is anoying, but other than that it's a good game. You get the ""phantom hourglass"" early in the game, what it does it alows you to breathe in the deadly air in the ocean king temple (wich you go to a lot through out the game) and you are timed, but it's not like your timed with every temple, over all try this game out. The touch-screen controlls are anoying to(especially if you lost your DS pen. It's not as bad as people say! Plus a few wind waker refernces!"
4,Pretty good,"This is a pretty good game, but definitely not the best Zelda around. I, for one, am not really a fan of the ""Toon Link"" graphical style, but that's just a matter of opinion that is both agreed and disagreed with by many, to each his own on that one. I have a harder time with the controls in this game, too, I think it could'v been easier. But, the game is still fun, the only thing that'd hold it back is the controls (which you will get used to), and personally for me the graphics (but like I said, that's controversial). This is a good game, and if you have a DS you should own it, but it isn't the best Zelda. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"
1,Not accurate,The MT4 is reading 3-4 degrees less then what the real temperature is. I would not recommend this product. I would not buy this product.
5,Raytek Laser Thermometer,I purchased two of these for a Christmas gift and they were well receivedTemperature is always right on spot
3,Not much shelf life,"I bought one brand new in 2000. I have used it very sparingly, it is safely stored almost by itself in a drawer of my tool chest, not bounced around at all, and always with the battery removed. Nine years later (!) I went to use it and it doesn't work. Raytek says they have seem the symptoms often, the unit needs recalibration or repair. They will repair it by replacement and even cover the shipping for $65.00 total. Well, I am disappointed that it doesn't work after the excellant care I have afforded this very handy tool. I will buy another from any of the less expensive sources available. (And hope it lasts a good long time with the same care, but it IS 'made in china' !)"
5,Good buy,Very accurate infrared thermometer. Excellent quality at a good price. Great for motor heads. I use mine for my boat.
5,Book on Water soluble pencils,Very informative and helpful whether you are an experienced artist or new to the use of pencils. Good for anyone from beginner to expert.
3,"The Explanation of Future Police ""Daycare""",Paris yet redefined in a sense of destruction yet preserving history
2,There Is Startlingly Portrayed Violence,"Muslim children need to have picture books in which they see themselves and families. I read to kindergartners and was glad to see this book on Amazon. It appeared to be just what was missing in their library. You can imagine my disappointment to see pictures of a child hiding under a bed, guns and bullets flying through the air and expressions of fear.This is not a book for most Muslim children, not one I would read to them anyway."
3,Kinda Slow,I got this book with High Expectation. It turned out a okay book in the end but I felt as though it dragged on a little bit. If you need to constantly have action to maintain your attention this book is not for you. If you want to read about a Kid who one day believes Superman will come to his rescue and teach him how to be Superboy then Enjoy! =]
4,This book is Huelga House,"This isn't a new book by the author, Bonnie Hearn Hill, but a re-release of her earlier book, Huelga House."
4,A Good First Effort,"This is the same book as Huelga House, but I like the title and cover much better. It really fits the subject, since the book deals with the Delano Grape Strike in the 1960s. Overall, it's much better than her more recent efforts in romantic suspense."
4,"Great Food, But Difficult Recipes","The food tastes great, but be prepared for some fairly complex laborious recipes, that call for ingredients which are sometimes difficult to get. Not for the beginner."
1,Ripoff 8 count boxes,"Thanks Quaker for shorting all the boxes now to 8 count and charging the same price per box. So a 20% price hike!! Amazon, uh you might want to change the picture from the 10 count box."
5,The Silent Miracle,"I have been using this meditation practice for about 3 years now. I was searching for so many answers to the confusion, frustration, anger and pain in my life. A few moments of stillness can be multiplied tenfold in a lifetime. This practice teaches by listening to oneself on the deepest level of feeling. You become your own teacher. Change does occur. I highly recommend this book as well as this author's first book The Way is Within."
3,Could have been made better but still good,"We received this via UPS, who tossed on our porch. The box looked like it had been through WWIII. We expected the worst, but were pleasantly surprised when we saw the undamaged pieces! Parts of it did not go together well. The drill holes were way off, we had to re-drill the holes in the metal piece which hold up the hanger and mirror, and we had to file very rough edges on the metal. The wood parts went together a little better, though - there were only a few things that had to be tapped with a rubber mallet to fit. When assembled it looked very good, and has turned out to be a good solid choice. The wood is a little redder and darker than the pic looks."
3,form versus function,The Valet Stand was easily assembled and good instructions are provided.The manufacturing and the material chosen are good quality.The only thing I missed was that there weren't any contemporary styles to chose from.
4,Product worked almost as described,"The buztronics Tiresparx works as described however, it is very sensitvie and can easily light up. I ordered it thru the mail and on arrival it was flashing in the package. Everytime I touched the package it would automatically light up. Despite this the product works as described. I would purchase it again."
3,disappointing,"I have what I thought was the same phone but with the answering system. It is ""Panasonic KX-TG2631W 2.4 GHz FHSS GigaRange Digital Cordless Answering System"". I love that phone.This phone looks the same, and showed the same features, so I ordered it as a second phone.Well, It looks the same, but it is missing two of the great features of the other phone - a headset jack and lighted keys.BE CAREFUL - Amazon shows headsets as accessories for this phone, but there is NO headset jack, so don't order them for this phone."
4,"Speakerphone good, Caller ID Bad","I bought this phone after my battery died on a GE cordless Phone. I wanted a simple phone and good reviews and this one provided that. I am very happy with my purchase, it's only been 2 months, but I love it. The caller ID doesn't work, but I do like that it tells you the battery status and when it is in use. I have roommates who might be on another phone within our house. We have one line. I also love the speaker phone because being that I am not a phone person, in addition to having tubes in my ears, I hate when my talkative friends call and have me on the phone for hours on end, leaving me with a sweaty earache afterwards. Now I can put them on speaker and do my own thing. It's in the handset, which is nice so I'm not broadcasting my conversation all over the house or room and just keeping it beside me while I'm on the computer or lounging in my bed. I highly recommend this phone."
3,Just a basci phone,"This phone works really good but has only the basic features. Its just a cordless phone but nothing else. One thing for sure, it serves its purpose, Good range and excellent quality. If you are looking for additional features like message box, etc, this is not the one. Doesn't even have a backlight for the keys.But to be fact, you dont have to spend $30 to buy a basic cordless phone. There's this GE one for $20 if I'm not wrong. I brought that one long back for my Internet phone and works great. Its a lil bulky than this panasonic but Go for it if its still cheap."
2,Doesn't hold up over time,"We've had this phone for about two years. It was okay but now we are looking to replace it. The caller ID often doesn't work and it just rings many times without a name. Sometimes the phone doesn't even ring but the caller leaves me a voicemail so I know that it didn't work properly. It's an OK phone, and its a good price, but I'm not thrilled with it. These problems have been getting worse with time."
3,WORKS!,I purchased this because of the price and it is a Panasonic. I have other Panasonic cordless phones that I love(work Great). This one however does not work as great. It is hard for me to hear on. It does work and I use it as little as possible. For the money I guess I can't complain.
4,Great for the price,"The quality for the price is awsome. The only thing is that this phone is kind of smaller than I thought...but does work great for its size.I'm use to it now. I liked it so much, I bought 3."
4,Good Phone,"I purchased this phone as a gift for my 70+ yr. old parents, unfortunately it was too complicated for them so I brought it home to use. It is a good phone with good features and for those of us acquainted with memory features, ring tones, volume controls, caller ID... etc., it meets the needs. The phone is just a tad bit to short for me, it has to be kept in a specific position near the mouth or the other party can't hear you clearly. Great battery and distance reception."
4,Panasonic KX=TG 26208 Cordless Phone,The Panasonic cordless phone arrived the day after I ordered it online. The handset is smaller than I anticipated it would be. Because of the small size of the handset it is easy to misplace unless I immediately replace it on the base after use. I need to use my eyeglasses to read the very small numbers on the handset when dialing. The tone quality and ring tone are very good. It is an acceptable phone.
2,"This is not the titled item ""smart industries shoot to win""","The product being sold here is different from what is depicted as the title. The price is 57% lower, but there are no specs. This could ""appear"" as a bait and switch. I do not know for sure, as there are no details on this ""dream team"" game and now it compares to the ""smart industries shoot to win""."
5,truly funny,"i was surprised this didn' t get too many reviews...it's quite hysterical! i picked it up @ the bookstore when i was bored, and was laughing my pants off pretty soon. it's really short, it'll take about 15 minutes to breeze through...a nice way to spend 15 minutes, in my opinion. my favorite:Stupid Entertainment:GOING TO ANY ANDREW LLOYD WEBBER SHOWi couldn't contain myself there, so i just burst out laughing...i'll have to admit i'm something of a guilty party there...but it's really funny! highly recommended if you're having a crappy day, just open it up and let Dr. Larry reinforce why your life sucks!"
4,Not the best but of course buy,"The manics plunge into the millenium with a new single 'that has nothing to do with the new album' says bassist Nicky Wire. The first thing that comes to mind when listening to the title song ""The Masses Againsit The Classes"" is early ""Motown Junk"" era manics. The track works but I felt it was a little forced and could've been a whole lot better. ""Close My Eyes"" is the typical whiney rock star song. I find a bit of the lyrics offensive to the fan but the music is great on the song. Finally we reach what is worth buying the single for, The Manics cover of Chuck Berry's ""Rock 'N' Roll Music"". James does an exellent job at translating the song musically for a new era and attitude. Overall we get a feeling of the roots of The Manics and some ponder into the future of The Manics."
1,Deceptive Advertising?,"Beware. From this web page, you might think (as we did) that the ensemble shown is what we were ordering. Not so!! We got a set of 250-count sheets, which, with the shipping, cost us $104. An outrageous price for this item.As a longtime customer, Amazon's reputation is hurt by allowing this kind of deceptive advertising on its site. If they are selling a sheet set, show a picture of a sheet set.Herbert E. Dower"
4,"Loved the Book, Hated the Grammatical Errors","I'm truly amazed that this is the author's first book. I was quite frustrated with the very obvious typos and grammatical errors. For instance, the word BANK was misspelled BACK. Errors aside, I loved the book."
4,Good book - a definite tear jerker!,"Three sisters with different issues, but they are all inter-related. You find yourself wondering why the mother showed so much favoritism toward one daughter and show no type of love and affection for the other two daughters, which causes all three sisters to have problems when it comes to their personal life and their relationship with men. This book is not your typical love story, but it's entertaining."
1,More leaks than an old roof,"After nearly 3 years, and being on my third one of this model, I gave up. The product folks at Pur are nice enough to send a voucher for a replacement and each one of these developed leaks over time. I think the water quality was ok, but the continual degradation of the seals on these led to leaks in each one. I have moved onto the Culligan model, which is cheaper and of better quality. Even the water tastes better. Save yourself the aggravation and money - Avoid this filter system."
5,Very Satisfied!,I've owned this product for over 2 years now and never had a problem with it until now. And that's because my 4 year old likes to climb onto the kitchen counter and holds onto this to let himself down. Now it's leaking water at the seal where you attach it to the faucet. So now I'm going out to buy another one. It's some of the best cleaning water I've ever tasted. I hate drinking clorine water! My kids drink more water too with this.
4,I like it!,"What's with all the negativity in the reviews? I own my chrome Pur faucet mount for over 3 month now and totally happy with it. It looks good, works well and the water's taste is to every one's satisfaction. As to bad reviews - there is always a chance of the flaws even with the best products, i just believe that happy customers are too busy enjoying their lives to write reviews! I was looking for something else on Amazon and came to this page by chance - decided to say something about the water filter i own to give other people another perspective."
1,Only lasted a few months - CHEAP!,"Like others have said, this thing starts to crack at the seams and leak after only a few months or so of use. Very cheaply made. Fortunately we bought it at a store that has a great return policy so we will be returning it and getting our money back."
1,a waste.,Photo was of a screw on fixture which I wanted but got a snap on which was useless to me. The snap on fixtures fall off all the time.
2,Pur Design or Quality,"Bought a Pur horizontal filter on a buying spree at a local Members store. Have had it over a year, and it really worked great to improve the taste of the tap water. However, the entire end at the base of the cap threads just cracked and blew out. No other issues other than product life and material quality or product design. I offer a don't buy because it should not fail via a pressure related fracture of the case material ( house hold water pressure)."
1,"Don't buy from Amazon, they sent me a used one !!",You pay for the new item but you get one which has been returned by someone. They did not even bother to remove the receipt of the person who returned it. Do you guys want to buy from this kind of retailer? Its better to spend a few dollars more and buy at your local store!
1,dont buy,"before the very first filter ever even finished, it started to crack all over... cheap product"
1,Bad tasting water,"About 6 months ago we discovered that the Pur counter top water filter that we have used for years was discontinued. We were very happy with it. So, we decided to purchase another Pur product. We purchased the Horizontal Faucet Filter. We ARE NOT happy with this one. To start with, it drips water down the back, it never tells us the filter needs changed, and it started leaking after about 3 months. About a month ago the water started tasting bad, so we thought we would change the filter (since it never tells us it needs changed), but the water continues to taste bad. The whole thing splatters and leaks like crazy. Now, my husband is an engineer and we are both college graduates...so we read and follow directions to the T on the package...but the water tastes horrible. We wish we had our old counter top filter back. But, since they don't make that we will be changing products to a different brand. What a waste of money!!!!!!!!"
2,Filter light broke within 2 days!,My last Pur faucet mount water filter cracked and I replaced it with the same model. The sensor light didn't function after 2 days of use. Will try Brita next time!
1,Leaks too,"As with others here and elsewhere on the 'net (see youtube for good examples), mine developed a leak around the bottom of the mounting nut a few months after installing it and only has only gotten worse the more I've tried to do something about it (tightening the nut, cleaning the washer/screen, using teflon tape on the faucet threads, etc.). I've continued to use it even with the leak but it now sprays so badly I'm afraid I need to find another solution. I've only gone through two filters.I tried a Britta filter before but their plastic threads stripped not long after installing that and I was hoping the Pur unit would be the answer... Guess I'll keep looking."
1,Not worth it,This leaks like crazy. Why is it so hard for Pur to make a water filter that doesn't leak?
1,Disappointed,"I was anticipating an exciting game, but to my amazement the game failed my least expectations.The game loads very slow, note I have a new computer with all the bells and whistles, and I was able to play the entire tutorial.I was not impressed, as the controls to move the main character work poorly and ajusting your view also works poorly.The real WHAM BAM came when wanting to play the game for real, well the game would not load up, except to show an advertisement, THEN my screen goes black. I have to soft boot my computer to get out.This happened over and over again until I decided that it was time to remove the game from my computer. WARNING: DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME !!"
3,It's OK,"Now that I've received this product (3 sets = total 6 bowls), I would have liked to know that the porcelain glaze has a few minor pits in each bowl and the lion's head is not very well defined (as compared to the Williams Sonoma product--granted at a higher price). I am pleasantly surprised to see that the bottoms are flat and will not hold water in the dishwasher."
4,liked it,I got this audio book and I liked it. It was engaging and had a lot of good solid concepts about what it means to be wealthy and stay wealthy
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this just as a summer read, I've been dating the same girl for well over a year and can say that our relationship is truly different, we do Love each other, and so on and so forth. This book basically says its impossible to do any of this, actually if you ever want to date ever don't read this book becaues it really should be dirrected to non Christians that have no idea how to date. This book actually made me half mad becuase it was so sterotypical ""girls even Christian guys just want to get in your pants"" what? No wonder the world is a messed up world today. It sounds like the authors to this book had a bad relatinship in their teen years and wrote a book to discourage dating from everyone else even though they said they incourage it."
1,The book your parents want you to read....,"Please do not waste your money on this book. ""Dateable"" is geared towards adolescent readers with a strong bias towards the ideals of the Christian church. This is the book that your parents want you to read. The book is generally pessimestic, dealing with the idea that before the age of adulthood, none of our relationships are going to last, so we might as well just give up. It tends to put the human psyche into a black and white stereotype, describing all men as shallow and sex-crazed and all women as emotionally distressed. In my opinion, the average person wants to read something that would help them change themselves so that they can acheive what they want in life. This book will tell you that there is no way to get what you want, so you might as well give up. I hope this book doesnt get anymore popular or else we will have a new era of distant, pessimistic and selfish youth that will not know how to truly love another."
1,not a very true book,this book acts like all guys are horny liars and all girls are emotional psychos. hey some guys are emotional and some girls are really horny too. very stereotypical and one-sided i would not recommend this book at all.
3,descent book,This book was pretty good. I thought it lacked biblical references. A good book for younger teenagers who need to learn to set boundaries within dating.
3,"About abstinence, not dating","I thought this book had smart ideas like how some people have trained their brain that they must breakup, even when things are going good, they must find something wrong. But it also seemed like the authors were trying to brainwash. My friends were getting mad at me and hiding this book from me. They make ridicuous claims that laying horizontal or having tickle fights are NONOs cuz they can lead to more (sex.) It is made obvious that the authors are christians who do not believe in sex before marriage. THE BOOK WAS ABOUT NOT HAVING SEX BASICALLY. Being dateable had nothing to do with it, except they imply noone wants a used car type of thing."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK.,"Look in this book. Where is the scripture from the Bible? Y'know, the Word of God? The realistic examples of serious teenage Christian relationships?The authors of this book are convinced that they are incredibly wise in all the ways of Christian teenage dating. All they tell you is that you're never going to get married until you've gone through several people and to not have sex. This is the worst book I have ever read!DO NOT BUY THIS. It will not help you further yourself in a Godly relationship, if anything, it will destroy it."
4,Dateable- An Excellent Book,"I read Dateable and found it very helpful. A lot of the advice was sound as a bell and answered many of the questions I had about relationships. However, I disagreed heavily with some of the content, such as:# All girls want commitment RIGHT NOW and doodle 'Mrs. Mary-Sue Hollings' or whatever all over their notebooks.# Your boyfriend/girlfriend MUST BE A CHRISTIAN AND THIS IS NON-NEGOTIABLE!# If a boy is alone with a girl he cannot control himself. (In my opinion, this relieves the boy of all personal responsibility and makes everything the girl's fault for being 'impure')Overall, however, I really liked the book. Although it is definetly written for the Evangelical Christian teen, It is helpful for everybody. Definetely should be on the required reading list for a girl/guy new to the dating game, especially if the parents never dated much."
1,Try reading something that actually teaches you how to love people,"This book is horrible. Nobody should be giving this to their son or daughter to read. It has nothing to do with how to date or be ""dateable"", only how to be afraid of ever having a relationship. This is not a book that you should read for incite, only for humor because of the loads of crap it gives you about how not to live like God wanted us to. God wanted us to love EVERYONE, yet this book says no relationship will ever EVER last if you are a teen and it's impossible for teens to actually love someone. If you want to learn something about how to love and be loved, read Proverbs. I'm pretty sure Solomon is more wise than Lookadoo. Read the Bible and learn how to love; don't read ""Dateable"", the book about how to be afraid of relationships and not love people."
1,Icky!,"Every person who goes to my friend's church got this book. I read it. It sucks. Don't get horizantal? What? How is cuddling foreplay? My friend cuddles with her boyfriend and they have never slept together...Also, the cover. Why does it look like a 12 year old girl is holding a 30 year old man's hand? Petafile!Overall, this book really sucks. We're burning all of their copies."
1,dating sucks,"Nobodies cares about dating, I rather stay home and watch T.V. Justin Lookadoo trying to play god how does he knows what's good for teens espacially dating."
2,Doesn't fit after washing and not totally organic,"The mattress pad barely fit my baby's crib mattress after I washed it according to the instructions. I have to constantly yank it down around the mattress edges and am afraid it will come off and surround my baby while he's asleep. Also, like another reviewer stated, only the cotton is organic in this mattress pad. The backing is basically plastic which is a petroleum product."
2,A disgusting disappointment,"The biggest turnoff of this special to me was how much crude humor it contained. Dil's pattened ""poopy"" catchphrase was used way too much (not to mention was already getting way old) and Phil's pants kept falling of resulting in the viewer seeing the place where the sun don't shine far too many times. Aunt Moo was also given way too much face time and didn't really fit in well with the main rugrats cast.I was annoyed that none of the grownups appeared and would've rather seen one of them narrate the story instead of Taffy or whatever the heck her name was.As for the way the story was told, it seemed like something on the level of really young kids of like 3 or 4 year olds. Being a diehard Rugrats fan I was disappointed in this movie special and advise everyone else to pass on ordering it."
4,"Cute, the kids love it. Mom not so happy about language.","My kids are 3.5, 4.5 and 8. The 3.5 year old is obsessed with this movie and wants to watch it nearly every day. The other two like it a lot, but not as much as the little guy. It is a cute movie, but I greatly dislike the use of ""stupid babies"" and some other impolite phrases, especially from Angelica. It's not really a movie anyone over 10 would want to see more than once. I agree about the ""pooping"" catchphrase from Dyl... unnecessary, as well as Phil's pants repeatedly falling down, however my little guys think that's hilarious. If I can just find the ""counting on a miracle"" song, I might be able to buy myself a few days free of the 110 minute movie.All in all, not awful, just not my favorite."
2,Overpriced,"A very good product, but you can find mouthwash in the grocery store with the very same active ingredient for a fraction of the cost."
3,Much better than it's 2005 follow up.,"While A Different Drum's ""State of Synthpop"" 5 disc collection showcased a plethora of bands of the electronic pop persuasion it also successfully had a much better playlist than it's sequel, ""A State of Synthpop 2005"". I won't bother mentioning the crap but the good stuff comes from artists from all around the world such as Wave In Head, Echo Image, Ganymede, Eloquent, Sweep, Raindancer, Neuropa, Axoe, Intuition, Neuroactive, Celluloide, Droom, Carnival of Dreams, Virtual Server, Backlash, Cosmicity, Gebrauche-Musik, Syrian, Gary Flanagan, Atlantic Popes, System22, New Clear Sky, Macando, Provision, & Nukleon. In all honesty I don't think this represents the real & amazing talent of this genre so your better off getting single tracks through Itunes or A Different Drums ""Synthpop Club Anthems"" series is far better than this too."
3,Good News....Bad News,"I am a huge Carla Neggers fan and automatically buy her books without reading the synopsis. The good news here is that I remain a huge Carla Neggers fan. The bad news is that this was a disappointing book. It had a slow developing plot; I almost abandoned the book. Back to some good news... the last quarter of the book was really suspenseful and I wished the previous chapters were as well written. The addition of many of Ms. Neggers characters from previous books seemed a little disjointed, developed too quickly and incomplete. A little more detail could have been used. Back to the good news...because the last quarter of the book was so good, that's what I remember the most and can't wait for Carla Neggers next book."
1,Breakwater - Carla Neggers,I do not recall ever getting this order. I believe there was a change of credit card difficulty and I don't think this particular order was ever received.
5,Fun for your little one,"Everyone loves to watch happy, adorable babies in special, fun places. These are wholesome, beautifully shot play scenes your baby will love to watch over and over. We own all three of these videos and they are well used by our children and their cousins. The perfect baby shower gift."
4,Minor Fitting Issue,I own a 2000 Chevy Astro and it said the mirror would fit my vehicle however it was slightly bigger than my driver side frame but the double sided tape that it comes with is good and that sucker won't come off any time soon.I also had to shave off a bit of the glass to make it fit. But for the price I cannot complain much. Safe driving everyone!
4,"34th FIST Marine, always an entertainment","34th FIST Marine have a real challenge with the armor division from Diamunde. They are in competition against a force that is superior to them and are going in a the tip of the sword with old weapon. Amazing and riveting as the storyline goes. It might be a bit slow to start but once started, it gets hot."
4,Military Sci Fi for the Ground Pounder in You.,"SYNOPSIS: A world has been taken in a coup and the flow of critical resources must be restored. To do this a Marine expeditionary unit is sent with follow on troops provided by the Army to take one of the planets cities as a beach head.The story mainly contends with the Marine action in taking the city and how the various components of an intergrated campaign is fought. The action is with the units and how the individuals in that unit accomplish their mission.It almost seems like Hue in space, with restrictive rules of engagement on the ground and political manueverings at home. The book almost reads like a historical account of a past battle, with units taking center stage and the individuals the highlights.Overall I enjoyed this book but some people may be put off by the lack of personal interaction or the inability to see who the hero/heroine is. For hardcore Military Sci Fi readers and Military History readers this is definitely a good read."
2,Don't believe the rave reviews.,I love the series up to this point. This book made me hesitate buying the fourth of the series. It just wasn't a good story line and the only saving grace was the continuing character development from past books.
2,ChessMaster - OK But Many Bugs,"The ChessMaster 9000 is an OK game; However there are stillmany bugs (esp on Win XP) which makes one lose any motivation to play. UBI Support is non-existent. Once you post a bug, youwill always receive a 'generic reply' within 48 hours. But theythen close the ticket and your 'bug' has now vanished.I'm now looking for a more stable and challenging program"
3,Good Chess...But Very Buggy !,"I received v1.0 of the program even though I ordered it in Jan. 2004. After many crashes and other wierd happenings I began looking for a patch. Installing the 1.02 patch from ubi web site was a must, It fixed some major problems but not all. The program is loaded with good stuff so I have learned to live with the bugs I enjoy the classroom sessions very much and play chess against one of the programs many personalities on a daily basis. As good as this program is I am very surprised it is not more stable."
1,Where's my game?,"I ordered Chessmaster 9000 On 2/10/11. I have not yet received it! I paid for it! They had no trouble taking my money! I contacted the company'Hitgaming Video Games', I have yet to here from them!!! This company is a rip-off. Thank's for nothing!!!!!!! I did order thru Amazon."
2,Keep looking,"This product is ok, but I rcommend Fritz. There are significant problems with both the interface and gameplay:INTERFACE PROBLEMS:-Nonstandard window background (I hope you like fake woodgrain)-No docking windows (dialogs floating everywhere)-No ClearType support (ClearType makes text HOT pink)GAMEPLAY PROBLEMS:-Takeback causes erratic play (serious flaw)-Minimizing causes the thinking lines to be reset-Computer never resignsFurthermore, UBI doesn't have plans to fix any of this before releasing ChessMaster 10000 (no free upgrade)."
1,chessmaster 9000,"My hard drive crashed, and Chessmaster 9000 is the ONLY program that will not install on my new hard drive. That's just plain robbery. I will never buy another Ubi Soft product."
2,"Enjoyable, but I'm disappointed","I've used many version of Chessmaster since version 3000, but CM 9000 is the first that's really frustrated me. Not because of the strength of play, but because of bugs that Ubi Soft seems to have no desire or ability to fix. At times, the computer tells me my game clock has run out, even though I have plenty of time left. When I look at the clock, it shows some ludicrous time, such as -43:00. At other times, the pregenerated opponents will simply stop thinking. You can sit until their time runs out, and they will not make a move. Neither problem happens all the time, but enough to be irritating.I may eventually give CM 10th a try, but, for now, I've switched to Fritz 9."
2,Brain-damaged program,"Other reviews have noted that the interface is confusing. I agree with this. I am also not thrilled that the program requires you to continually produce the original CD, although I can live with this. What really ticks me off is that you cannot run this program (in Windows XP) from an account that does not have administrative privileges. What's the point of an administrator account?? To *administer*. If you set up a machine to have an administrator and you want your kids to have limited accounts, they will not be able to run Chessmaster 9000 unless they're logged in as you.Give me a break."
3,Chessmaster 9000 has big bugs!,"Pros and cons:Pros are that it has a good game engine, plays well, has numerous player-selected settings (but some don't work).Cons are that it is overly complex in its organization because it has a number of less than useful functions and poorly-defined screens, has several big bugs that make it crash (it will not let me enter Library and Tournament rooms, crashing the program and locking up the computer).Two CDs are included in this package but the documentation does not mention two CDs. The Read Me file on the CD states that this software was not throughly tested prior to release.John Clark"
4,You Can Play a MONKEY!!,"I bought this game for my husband in 2004. He loves to play chess and because he wins EVERY SINGLE TIME we play, I soon tired of playing chess with him. The answer? Buy him a virtual chess partner! Enter the Chessmaster 9000.The game, as I recall, was easy to load on our PC, and was very user-friendly to play. My husband played with the game for several months, before moving on to a new pastime (guitar playing, I believe).But for the most important aspect: Chessmaster 9000 allows the option to play against a monkey! If you have your own monkey, you may not need to buy Chessmaster 9000. But, if you're like our family and you don't have a resident monkey, BUY THIS GAME!!"
2,Not Win2K,"Beware!!! Supposedly runs on Windows, just not Windows 2000.After trying to install Chessmaster 9000, I checked out ubisoft's FAQ to find out they explicitly do not support Windows 2000. Why can't they call this out on the box?Okay, shame on me for not reading the box closely. When I bought Chessmaster 9000, I glanced at the box to make sure it supported ""Windows"".How on earth does a company with supposedly a great product not support Windows 2000 is amazing. So, now I am stuck with software I cannot use.Fritz runs well on Windows 2000 and is a great product."
4,Very nice game,"I am a chess player, so I needed a good chess software. There are many chess softwares out there for much of $$$. But, Chessmaster 9000 is, for the lack of a better word, perfect for $10. Easy to use software, a lot of different modes of AI, for begginners, intermediate, and advanced. Many options, okay graphics, ratings, tournaments, online play, etc.Very good game.Crashed once had to reinstall (probably just my computer).If you like chess, you might want to have this game."
1,No support for Windows XP!,Well I've been searching for Chess games recently and I'm surprised that this version which is being released in September 2002 is not compatible with Windows XP!Yes look at the requirements: Windows 95 / 98 / Meor go to UBI Soft's website and indeed they are not supporting Windows XP for most of their games including this one. They say something about Windows XP having a new file type that is not compatible with their software.GRRRR I mean come on! I have a new tower PC and a new laptop both with Windows XP and I would love to have a nice Chess game available for it. UBI Soft get it right! Support Windows XP!Well I've love to play this game if I could. :(They only get a 1 star review from me until they support a Windows XP version.Stephanie
4,A Master's opinion:,"I don't own this version of chessmaster but I used to own Chessmaster 7000, the games annotated by IM Josh Waitzkin makes this a good buy but I wouldn't pay more than $35. The annotated games are basically chess lessons, which you would be paying $40-50 an hour for. You might want to check out a program called PowerChess its simple program based on calculating your position (nothing else will improve your chess quicker, you could prob buy it for $10 if its still available) and once you get good enough, buy Fritz to analyze."
3,One install is all that is required,I don't understand what one of the reviewers is talking about as far as having to load the CD everytime you play. I installed Chessmaster 9000 and on subsequent games have not had to use the CD. This was true with previous versions but not with 9000. I have also not had problems with system crashes. I think for the money this is one heck of a product.
3,Pretty Good For Chess,"I am really into chess, and the Chessmaster 9000 software is pretty good for a chess tutorial. My favorite features are the Josh Waitzken's audio tutorial with his recorded help. The features such as Blunder Alert and the game library with historical chess games are also helpful. Although Chessmaster 9000 is probably the best chess software, it gets old facing a computer player. The tutorial is helpful, but the best practice is to play against actual players, thus I would not reccomend this software. Play on the Internet on various sites instead, for free. Playing games is experience and the best way to improve chess skills."
5,Win XP,"This is the best chess game on earth and of course it will support Win XP, even if they say 98/ME. Do you really think they'd make a game not supporting XP in 2002 ???"
3,Only one problem,"Very strong play, but the CD needs to be in the drive most of the time, which is unreasonable, and enough trouble to keep me from using the program."
5,Great Program,"Excellent software for learning chess and improving your skills. There are scores of simulated opponents ranging in skill from children to grandmasters. It feels like you're sitting down and playing a game with another person. This is a very good program. I've been playing it every night. Hey, there's a reason this series has been around so long."
3,Great but crashes often,"One thing I always hated about chess programs is they had no personality. Well that's no longer true with Chessmaster 9000. It has lots of personalities, and each one has their level and playing style. It's so much more fun to play against someone at your level than a 2800+ master, so this is a great feature. The training excercises are fun too. Only problem is the program crashes often. It crashed on me 3 times in one hour today and I gave up on it. I see others say the same thing so I know it's not my computer. It's too bad because otherwise it's a great program."
1,Big Daddy,"This product should not be on the market. You must take the program CD with you when on trips or while in sick the hospital. This is very inconvenient! I bought Chessmaster 9000 thinking it was the best, I was very wrong. The chess game from windows that came with my computer is a lot better and you do not have to reload to use it. I have had to do this several times, along with uninstall and reinstall. I tried in vain to contact the company. This is JUNK; I will not buy from UBI SOFT anymore."
4,A good work on an almost useless weapon!,"This is about what one would expect from an Osprey title: well researched and written, excellent color plates and photos.The Universal Carrier (""Bren Gun Carrier"") is amazing in that a sophisticated, well-funded military would actually buy and field such a useless weapon - and in quantity! Truly, here is a weapon that was useless in its intended role. It was too poorly protected to support infantry with direct fire and too small to carry any useful load.The Universal Carrier is an excellent example of poorly thought-out weapons development."
3,smaller than expected,"Make sure you look at the dimensions before you order. It's a nice figurine, but much smaller than I thought it would be."
4,Nice but small,"Make sure to read the product description. This figurine is beautiful, but because of my own fault and error, it is smaller than I anticipated. I decided to still keep the item because it is a beautiful piece of craftsmanship."
3,Mixed Reactions...,"I had mixed reactions to this book. On the plus side, it is well written and researched; it reads fluently and intelligently. On the minus side, it is largely restricted to an account and analysis of her professional life. I gather this is because there is very little that is known about Gish's private life. This is not the fault of the author, but it did make for some tedious reading from about the halfway point forward. I would have liked to get a better sense of who she was as a personality."
4,Well researched,"Well researched bio of film star Lillian Gish that contained a lot of information that I had not read before. I like the interviews with those who worked with her. The author did everyone a favor by not reciting long plot summaries of the films but at times provided too much personal opinion on the films. The book has a great footnote, bibliography, and filmography section. However, I would have liked more photographs."
4,A Good Read,"Before I read this book I knew almost nothing of Lillian Gish other than she was one of the top 25 female American Film Institute screen legends. This book provides ample information of both her personal life and her movie/stage career. Since the majority of her ""significant"" work was done predominantly in the silent era, I don't feel the need to read further on her because I think this book gave me all the information that I needed to know about her.I'll agree with some of the other reviewers that the author's tone is at times quite judgmental (which is very apparent), and some more pictures in this biography would have been appreciated, but overall it was a good read."
5,Beguiling Bar of Beauty,"This is, hands down, my favorite soap. The high grade distinctive green bar is made in India with genuine Ayurvedic herbal extracts and mixed with natural vegetable oils such as coconut, patchouli, and sandalwood. It contains no animal products whatsoever.The scent is simultaneously light and pungent, and while it delivers a nice aromatherapy during bathing it does not cling to the skin. One does not smell like a patchouli princess (or prince)! Rather, one emerges from the bath cleansed and refreshed. Chandrika does not dry the skin as other soaps tend to do. My tub closet is always heavily stocked with it, and houseguests frequently inquire where they can find it, as once they use it, they are hooked!"
3,inexpensive; good quality,"For less than five dollars, this exceeded expections and met my needs. Good quality product. Only wish that terminal were longer-banana plug makes little contact and not enough for friction alone to maintain contact"
4,Well Written...,"Well written... I enjoyed this story! Love both Paris and the 1930's, so already off to an interesting start. The story moves along at a consistent pace and believably incorporates Hemingway, Stein and Picasso. Liked the letters written by the ""nanny"" especially. As a Vegan the downside for me were the desriptions of food consumed at various Paris eateries. A la Vie!"
4,Beware of unauthorized DVDs,"As noted by the reviewer above, the DVD that is already floating around is from Brazil and IS NOT and has not ever been authorized for release by Peter Cetera. I had purchased my copy through a Seller on eBay and he guaranteed that this was a licensed product, though Mr. Cetera has just posted that this is not true. You may read the following at his website www.petercetera.com under PC Speaks:""09.06.04Another thing!....People keep asking about what is an authorized CD or DVD.....ON the DVD thing, the only one that's authorized is the PBS one...Iv'e never authorized the final SLC one ,so as far as IM concerned it isn't.....As far as CD's,the ones on the site are real... I've seen certain ones around that aren't, including a certain greatest hits that used to be on the old site... Other than a few single songs on soundtrack CD's here and abroad I can't vouch for anything else...See Ya...pC"""
5,Jock itch fix,The main ingredient is the same as that used in a number of other over the counter ones. The thing that sets this one apart is the fact it is it contains Aloe Vera and dispenses as a very smoothe ointment and really has worked for me. I'm now on my 2nd tube.
5,Lasted for 11 years!,I was so excited to find these bowls on Amazon. We received a set of these 11 years ago when we got married and they have been great. We still have at least two of the originals. Over the years we have tried different bowls but these have lasted and have a great design. They aren't cheap but they are incredibly durable-and attractive too!
3,Missing parts = No 5 Stars For You,"Be advised, this is not a retail package, and does not come with a manual. That's fine, but the thing that bothered me is that this MoBo requires 11 mounting points within the case, yet inside the hardware envelope, there were only 8 'Stand offs' (or mounting spacers, if you prefer). This is unacceptable. Selling hardware is what you guys are supposed to be doing for a living. One would think you'd be doing it correctly and with care. You get one chance to impress, and I am not. It's too bad when mediocre becomes good enough for some. It's not for me. I will not be purchasing anything from you guys in the future. Harsh? Too bad. There are many other hardware purveyors out there.On the plus side: Board works fine. Shipped the same day as the order was placed."

1,This motherboard did not work...Simple enough.,"This motherboard did not work...Simple enough.I ordered this motherbooard to setup a linux base ftp server. Well the motherboard failed. I will never by motherboards from this place again.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E887YY/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titleIntel Desktop Board D915PBLL - Mainboard - Atx - I915P - LGA775 Socket - Lan En,"
3,notations,"A previous owner has put biro annotations in the margins of the first180 pages. Distracting, as they seem meaningless to me."
1,"bad, bad, hilariously bad",the author must enjoy frequent lapses in his reality. the ideas are incoherent and striving towards mundane tautology. this is not a book for a curious mind. i couldn't believe someone actually wrote something so awful.
4,Great album to relax and chill to,"I love this album. Frisina's music is a beautiful reinterpretation and blending of classic jazz and samba. The songs are sophisticated, fun and filled with attitude. The melodies stay with you. My favorites on the album included the gods of yoruba, jazzy ally, gosto de que e bom and batucafro."
4,Now I Love to Read!,"I like the Molly books very much. They are some of the best books I've ever read. Valerie Tripp did a wonderful job telling a story about a young girl during World War II. Molly has an adventuresome spirit. I think just about any girl would enjoy the American Girls Collection. They are a big page turner. I could read an entire book in one day if I had the time. I've already read the complete Samantha series, which is my favorite so far. I never really liked to read until my grandmother gave me the American Girls books."
3,Well......,"Its not that I hated Molly McCintire's character, although I thought she and her siblings needed to be kinder to one another and I wondered why her mother allowed them act like that, but the problem is her books are so...boring.I don't find myself very excited about her story. It would've been more interesting if she did something exciting for her country! Her story takes place in war, right? And another thing, why can't the news of the war affect Molly a little more? Why can't she stand up strong for her country? I know exciting things were short to come by because she's not really in a battlefield, but come on, make the books more tantilizing! I have trouble finishing them when I read them, I just can't force myself to stick to it!I am in no way saying other people can't like it, you can like it if you want, its your choice. But for myself I found this collection so bland."
5,American Girl Series,I purchased this for my Granddaughter. She loves the American Girl series and has read several of the other books. She was absolutely thrilled.
3,It's an okay book,"Molly's books are okay. They have excitement in them atleast. But Molly herself is a spoiled little bratt. She is shown to be a girl who lives a hard life and everyone is against her. Yah, right! I have collected some of the books from the American Girl collection, and the best books are deffinately those from The Samantha and Kirsten collections. I reccomend those books way above Molly's."
3,A reasonable introduction...,"This publication can be summed up as a reasonable introduction into conventional ""modern"" yacht design. However, it seems to be tailored towards amateur boat builders or even the keen sailor. A lot of ground is covered, but it only scratches the surface on many subjects. But perhaps this is all one should expect from a publication that only claims to cover the ""principles"" of yacht design. In my opinion as a naval architect, the book seems to lack depth and scientific data that could make it an interesting read or reference work for the professional."
4,Basically comprehensive but calcs are incomplete,"This is a worthwhile text on yacht design and is fairly comprehensive. It's the best replacement to date for the venerable but dated ""Elements of Yacht Design"" by Norman Skene. One word of caution though-if you take the time to actually follow through all the formulas and design methodologies, you'll find that the calculations are often incomplete or simply incorrect! If the publishers or authors would take the time to properly edit this book, they'd really have something."
4,Critical Thinking,Very well written and easy to comprehend and dissect. The title does indeed speak volumes about the contents in this book. Interesting insights into what critical thinking entails.
5,Babymouse Rules,"I am a 4th Grader and I liked the part where Babymouse's locker attacked her and the Squid spit her out. This book was real good because it had funny pictures and the words were funny. I have never read a book like this before. I also like her stories because they have drama and action. I think only girls would like book becuse the main character is a girl and the book has lots of pink in it. My Mom also read the book and it made her laugh. One thing about Babymouse, she loves cupcakes like me."
5,"""new music"" for solo accordion","This is a solo recording played on the chromatic bass accordion, a demanding instrument which allows the performer to play melodies with both hands. The album is very pleasant, with whimsical moments. Could interest fans of Guy Klucevsik, Accordion Tribe, etc."
1,Blah-Blah-blah,"This book could easily be reduced to 100 pages. Repeat after repeat, and the cartoons give me a break."
3,"Good Content, terrible writing style.","Like most promotional books, this one is dry and could be condensed into about 50 pages. The Chief obviously knows his business, and that is IMS.What you will find (most likely) very annoying (distracting) is Brunacini's frequent (almost every paragraph) use of the parentheses.C'mon, Chief, we know your are getting paid (cabbage) by the word, but with all those extra (unneccesary) use of quotes, this book (text) is very distracting and tough to follow.Read it for yourself, you'll see what I mean."
2,"Nice idea, too bad it cracked","I loved being able to measure out the oil when cooking. Never had a problem with drips - as long as you release the pressure on the bulb when transferring. I started noticing rings of oil on my granite under this and thought I was being messy. After paying close attention to using this, I found the ring was due to the bottom/base cracking along the seam where it joins the bottle. Thus my fears about it being plastic were realized. Wish it were available in glass!"
2,Loved it - until it started leaking.,We loved this oil dispenser until it started leaking. The seal at the bottom must have failed because there is no visible crack anywhere on the container. Small amounts of oil just started leaking out onto our counter top every day. I'm actually going to buy another one and hope that it was just a fluke. It is too convenient to simply dismiss the design.
3,Oilly mess,This oil beaker and applicator tends to stick in the opening and can make a mess when you finally get it out to despence. It also builds up with a oily residue around the opening and is difficult to clean would be better if the beaker was made of glass instead of plasic.
1,FAKE!,THis is NOT faux leather. It's is paper. It's a plain journal covered in a photograph of leather. Don't waste your money! I'm sorry I did.
3,It's Pretty Good..But..,"As a Bay Area native, I'm a longterm Greenwald fan. The book, while offering moments of Greenwaldian wisdom and insight, dwells too much on personal bitterness (don't ruin your persona as years progress a la Cosell, Hank) and family issues which, while laudable, are not what the audience for this book expects nor appreciates.The book starts great but loses reader interest near the end."
2,Wildly overpriced,"As a guide to the trees of N-America (exclusive of Mexico and tropical Florida) it seems obvious to compare it with Sargent's ""Manual of the Trees of North America (exclusive of Mexico)"", now available as a Dover-reprint. The present book appears an abbreviated and updated version of the earlier one, with distribution maps the most noticeable addition. However I find the earlier one definitely more attractive, if only because the line-drawings are so much clearer in the old book. In Preston's book the reproduction of the drawings is very black, and hence unclear.When comparing this with the magnificent ""Trees_of_Canada"" by John Laird Farrar (aka ""Trees_of_Northern_United_States_and_Canada"") the book by Preston looks shabby indeed. The most kindly thing to be said would seem to be that this is vastly overpriced. Surely the USA can do (a lot) better than this for its trees?"
4,Glad I could find this online - and appreciate seller's efforts,"I haven't been able to find any coffee flavored syrups in area supermarkets for years now, so I ordered this product. The flavor is good, although I wouldn't mind if the syrup was a little thicker, especially when used on ice cream. I enjoy mixing it in a glass of low-fat milk, adding a shot or less of Kahlua or Tia Maria, and putting it in the freezer for several hours. Makes a tasty frozen treat.I especially want to thank the Amazon seller from whom I purchased this product. In addition to shipping the six squeeze bottles in a cardboard box, Lil-BigShots took the time to wrap them in pairs inside protective bubble-wrap mailing envelopes. I've had some products from Amazon sellers arrive in poor condition, and I appreciate the extra time and effort taken by this seller."
1,Horrible.,"I used to buy Camp Coffee (Chicory and coffee essence) in England, and that stuff was lovely! I found this in a small store today, and thought I would try it as I really miss Camp. I'm drinking it now and it is bloody awful (which I should have known) because it is sweetened with corn syrup. I do not understand how anyone in this country - USA - can find it acceptable to have everything sweetened by foul CORN SYRUP which tastes DIFFERENT to sugar and leaves a weird feeling?/taste in ones mouth. If you demand real sugar, then you probably won't like this product."
3,Worthwhile,"As already stated, nothing like Kenshin. I liked most of the storyline, the weird looking monsters sort of looked out of place, (maybe because i wanted something more like Kenshin) But overall i liked watching the series up until the last episodes, which was pretty far-fetched and seemed to tie up the loose ends, or confuse you so much you don't care anymore.... in that case it reminds me of Kenshins' episodes after he defeats Shishio.... Sometimes when a writer can't stretch it anymore, you end up with a few episodes that are worthless.Again.... This show is worthwhile... but the ending was not. My advice is to preview the whole thing first, (maybe just skip the last episode lol) maybe you'll really like it, maybe you'll be happier you didn't spend $100+ when you really wanted something more like Kenshin ^_^"
4,Pretty good if you're a big fan of samurai and fantasy stuff,"First of all, why do so many people compare Kyo to Kenshin? That's like comparing apples to oranges! Anyway... I got the boxed set for my birthday and let me tell you, DO NOT WATCH THIS IN ENGLISH! The dubbing is straight terrible! You're better off watching it with the Japanese track turned on with English subtitles. Also, the story line makes more sense when reading the English subs than listening to the English dubs.Overall, the anime heavily detracted from the manga since they didn't have much to work with at the time. Overall, the ending is therefore wrapped up too fast and is kinda trite, but the majority of the story is ok, focusing a lot on character development.Oh, and about the characters declaring their moves before laying the smack down, some find it annoying, but doesn't it make sense for those watching the duel to know what killed the poor opponent? Voice of the phoenix! Suzaku! ^_^"
5,I love this book,I was very pleased with this purchase and I love this book! I bought it for both of my children!
5,Iron Maiden at its best,Bruce Dickinson is back in Iron Maiden and what could we expect? The beast at its best. With this cd-single you will have an awesome new track from their just released new album Brave New World and two live tracks from the Blaze Bailey's era with a new and improved singer. An excellent choice if you want new stuff.
2,Not a book to use for an On-line class,"This is not a book to use for on-line classes. Does not read well and does not show step by step instructions that are easy to follow. I aced my last 2 math classes, but am having difficulty in this one. Not because of the material, but because the way the book reads."
3,Too Bad...,Let me start by saying I love the series. I was so excited to find this series at such a budget price. It started off amazing; I bought the first season and fell in love so I bought the 2nd and 3rd set of the S.A.V.E. series and was sorely disappointed. The box is a bit misleading by stating the 3rd and 4th seasons would be 16:9. Yes they are in widescreen but there were not enhanced for widescreen tvs. So what I got was this tiny little widescreen show in the middle of my widesreen TV!!! I am pissed! Such a shoddy presentation from funimation!If you are willing to overlook the deception buy the set...if not...look somewhere else.
1,The image is grey I received a pink one!,"Do you, Amazon people, read the reviews? there are already 2 about the same problem. We think that we are ordering the grey case and receive a pink one. Why don't correct this including a way to choose the color. There is really a picture, very small, which can be amplified, with the other colors, but there is no option to choose. Now the case is already in Brazil, no way to return it! I don't know what to do with the pink case, it is intended for my sons birthday!"
4,Need Change Color,"The picture is grey, i received a pink one. it is for a boy. what am i going to do with a pink one?, i need change the color."
1,A cas of mistaken identity!,"I think this case wanted to hold DS in but didnt't quite grow big enough!Its a tight fit! I bent the zipper trying to close it, there is nowhere to put any cames, a bit of a waste of money really! Go for one of the bigger ones!!!"
1,Color,"The case is useful in itself, but I received a pink one and, since the present is for a boy, he did not like it so much. I did not notice the color of the case when ordering. It would be useful to make the options more visible in the page. thanks"
4,Whishing on a star that hasn't fell.,"Love Hina is very well written, drawn and acted. The problem: 1) the gutless boy just can't get it right and ask her out. 2) The darling girl is so thick headed, she can't see what is in plain sight. Answer, drive these two at eachother until someone figures it out. Result, lots of laughs, lots of upsets,a few tears, and lots of shouts as you get fed up with the characters line of thinking. I do want to see more. I am one of those who despise unresolved, but as for an excellent show, You Should Be Watching this one. Not full of nastiness, or over zealous with fan service, but a good down to earth story about a boy, his promise to a girl, his feelings for the one of his dreams and the girl who can't get see obvious. Do yourself a favor and watch this with your tenager or significant other, you will enjoy it."
4,Good story but kinda slow,"I really enjoyed this anime the first time watching it, however re-watching it seems to make it a tad bit less enjoyable. On a good note I did find all the characters to be lovable, however I found Motoko's character a little bit annoying because of her ""special sword technique's"" all the time, but still kinda cute at times."
2,Eh pretty bad honestly,Honestly I can't find much good to say about the show....the humor is why it gets a 2 but the rest of the series is lame....no character development....every episode is just reasons to hit the main character....it got old quick
4,Comedy romance done well,"This one is probably okay for teens and depending on your personal beliefs, possibly older children. (Some moderately adult situations).Basically a loser kid trying to get into college gets ""stuck"" taking care of his granny's apartment building. It turns out it's an all girls' dorm now and his arrival causes quite a stir, especially since granny's already left and didn't tell the girls he was coming.I think this one is a definite ""keeper"", but probably isn't in my favorites. Though it comes very close. It is above average in most respects. Story is well written and based on the precept of childhood promises versus present feelings. I consider it well worth the money and the time to watch (and I've watched it a couple of times already)."
4,A good clasic,"This is a good old classic that any anime lover or someone just getting into anime would like... however I would not give it to anyone under the age of 13, as it is .... graphic in a nudity sort of way. That said, this is one series that needs to be watched at least once in a life time...However I dont think that its something that you would watch every day or every week.... it would get tiresome.Good story line, always keeps you laughing when you get into the story a bit of a ways."
2,Well...,"Having previously read Ken Akamatsu's ""Love Hina"" as a manga, I had my hopes set high as I purchased this item. I was sorely disapointed by its lack of parallel to the orginal manga story, so much so that I could not finish the third episode.After taking some time away I decided to give it a clean start and try again, this time with a more open mind. I wantched as new characters were introduced and as some that should have been were completely forgoten.Overall, I was not impressed with this particular anime. As the episodes rolled by, the story never really progressed and the characters never evolved. Each episode starts with the same cookie-cutter template."
1,Not a classic for me,I dont like when guy charactere keep being hit for any reason angry women have. Most of the time it's not even it's fault and it's never funny. I dont think I have even had a smile once. This anime is just that. A guy who try to be a good guy but is put in situation that it is not is fault and being punished for it anyway and we are supposed to laugh. Avoid unless that is really what you are looking for
5,Not your average coffee table book,"Not your average coffee table photo book; not only were the photos of women great, but the stories captured the essence of the subjects. I couldn't stop reading it; the essays were wonderful and inspiring. I bought a second copy for my daughter."
5,American Woman,"One of the greatest books ever published, not only did it give me insight into my own world as a woman in today's society, but it also opened my eyes to how much we as women have accomplished in the past few years. I would recommend this book for every woman in America, and also there was just a great review in People magazine."
5,great graduation gift,"A great graduation gift for a young woman...a variety of women's stories, all photographed and edited with a heart-felt, yet sophisticated look."
1,not for my coffeetable,"I picked up this book while I had some time to kill at the public library on a recent business trip and realized it most definitely does not belong on our coffee table. It is far from representative of American women but is strong in conveying the feminist message that real women get along best in the absence of men, particularly husbands. Instead of celebrating women who live without men, most glaringly portrayed by the lesbian couple, I'd appreciate stories about real American women whose womanhood unfolds at home surrounded by the love of a real man, her husband, and her numerous dear children, whom she is probably home schooling."
4,Best Of Freestyle File 1,I'm a fan of the albums DMA has put out. I wanted to add this CD to my collection. .
3,MAJOR Disappointment,"I couldn't wait to get this book. When it arrived in the mail, I immediately opened it and started to read. This was one of the silliest books I have ever wasted time to read. Herky jerky plot line. Why did she start to write to him? How did she get the address? (READ the book for why it doesn't make sense.) Why she continued to sign off on wrong reports? PLEASE!!!"
1,Horrible,This was one of the worse books I've read. I will not be buying anthing by this author again.
5,Like a day of sunshine in Seattle.....,".....this musical offering by LaMont Ridgell is the most pleasant of surprises!Perhaps it is the lack of cabaret venues in this country, or the very few quality cabaret performances, that makes this CD so appreciable. Mr Ridgell never fails to make me wonder how we managed to be satisfied with a contemporary male vocalist before 'Intimacy' was released. In Seattle, we have more than ample opportunity to hear singers, new and other-than-new, but all singing nothing-new. I can nonetheless tell you how much I've been pleased to hear not only a new singer, but new (to me) songs. My favorite track? 'If I Ever Say I'm Over You'. If ever I could wear out a CD and any particular track, this'd be it. I can think of ten films that would've been all the better had LaMont sung this song on the soundtrack.I'll gladly, but not very patiently, await the release of LaMont's next album, just as I await a sunny day in Seattle. Let us hope it'll be sooner than later."
2,Brain dead,"This could have been a great game. I mean it. The mission structures are great, and weapon choices are top notch, and the overall feel is not bad. The thing that annoys me is the team AI. I must say that this game probably has the most stupid team AI I've ever seen on any tactical shooter. They like getting killed, like stunning themselves with flashbangs, ocassionally like shooting their mates AND getting shot by their mates. Very often you'll end up dying because these chums don't know how to cover you, very often they'll walk into your field of fire while you're shooting, and very often you'll turn around to find yourself alone, backtracking to find them stuck behind a door or just playing statue in a hallway. When you do find them, they'll run to you like a lost child who's just found his parent. How stupid is that? Please, AVOID THIS GAME, unless of course you've got too much money. Go play Ghost Recon instead. It's a more worthwhile investment."
1,Another dud,"I am sure the movie will be good as all the Clancy Movies have been, but unfortunately if the demo I have played of this game is a decently accurate sample of the game, then there is not much to look forward to. It uses the same horrible engine as the pitiful Ghost Recon game uses. You still move slow as a snail and have litle directional control over your character as you can't map the left and right keys like in Ghost Recon. Another military fiasco to add the the growing list of dud military games. I.E. the rest of the clancy games, the delta force games, Operation Flashpoint, to name a few. So don't waste your money or time on SOAF."
2,You Still Have to Diet and Exercise,"I have been taking this product for 3 weeks, in that time I have actually GAINED a few pounds. I have just started a diet and exercise plan that I plan to follow while taking ""Zero Gravity"". Don't expect the pills to do the work for you, you have to join the effort.I do like that this product contains no stimulants, pills are a decent size, and never leave me feeling jittery or sick.I will update later if I see any results or have anything to add after I have been using this product for at least a month."
2,A disappointment,"I expected the book to be filled with photos in the style of the one shown on the book cover.After 4 months of delays waiting for it to be published, what arrived on my doorstop was a book with nearly half of its pages that have various shots of the ""Hollywood"" sign under different lighting conditions.BORING!"
2,Not what I expected,"As a another customer commented, you might expect the contents of this book to reflect the photo on the cover. But that would be a mistake. If you're expecting something along the lines of Roffman or Underhill, this book isn't for you -- the subject matter is grittier and the suggestive nudity depicts mixed sexes in many shots. Most surprising, though, is that most of the pages aren't sexual at all and instead seem to focus on the Hollywood sign, L.A. buildings, and nature scenes."
3,Fun to have a T+J game,"My son wanted it when he saw it but never played it and instead made me do so while he watched. He's not a gamer. I'm sure if you are it would be fine.This was cheap and fun. It's less favorably reviewed (and justifiably so) elsewhere, but it's still okay in my book."
3,Lara Bars are ehh...,"I just had my first LaraBar in the flavor of Pecan Pie. It was okay, but it really didn't taste much like a pecan pie. I'm gluten and lactose intolerant, so it served the purpose of some protein, but it wasn't as ""delicious"" as all of the reviews say."
3,Can't Beat it for the price,Great price but the blindfold isn't very comfortable. It does it's job but maybe investing in a slightly better one is a good choice.
1,Not a SA adapter,This plug is a standard European plug and is not compatible with the standard South African sockets that i encountered in Johannesburg or Durban. I already have two other European plugs and do not apprecieate the blatant missrepresentation of compatibility. Beyond that the plug itself is just fine.
1,Poor quality adapter,I purchased two of these adapters. Within one month of using them in India the ground prong pulled out of one the adapters. I took it to have fixed but the electrican could not repair it.
2,Novice editor or poor OCR?,"This book has a typo every two or three pages. ""Fun disclosure"" instead of ""Full disclosure"" is one of the more comical examples of something Confucius surely never said, and exemplifies a recurring motif of putting an ""n"" in place of 2 ""l""s.Another curiosity mentioned is a cow that was ""homed"" instead of ""horned"".The typos include missing articles, missing pronouns, and sentences that do not parse. These categories of errors cause me to wonder whether the person who laid out the book was merely unfamiliar with English or unacquainted with the Latin alphabet as well. Perhaps the entire job was done with primitive optical character recognition software and no human supervision. That would explain the visual nature of many of the errors.A pretty poor job considering that you can get Analects free at Gutenberg.org"
2,nothing special,"The works of Confucius cannot be denied their place in history or their importance to China and surrounding countries, but this translation should not be considered a good example of such an important work.Not being a scholar on the subject, I can only offer a layman's insight; the poor formatting, slack editing and general sloppiness of this book is a substantial letdown. The translation itself is less accessible to that of other translations I have read/own, but offers some interesting thoughts for comparison with other versions. As a starter for the novice, I wouldn't recommend it. That being said, it's one saving grave is the fact that within one book, you get not only the Analects, but also The Doctrine of the Mean and The Great Learning, which ALMOST make it worth buying. Almost. Two stars for the added works.For a good translation of the seminal Confucian works, look elsewhere says I."
4,The b*st*rd love child of Kate Bush and Klaus Nomi,"Every reviewer everywhere compares Sophe Lux to Kate Bush. And for good reason! It's as if group leader Gwynneth Haynes is the b*st*rd love child of Kate Bush and Klaus Nomi (an impossibility I know for SO MANY reasons), raised by Lene Lovich at the Howard DeVoto estate.That description tells you everything you need to know. Either you are now thinking that you must own this CD, or you know you should run away.This CD does not play it ""safe."" Nor will it leave you ""far from heaven."" It definitely is not the ""Karen Carpenter Story""! (Gwynneth is the sister of film director Todd Haynes, if you didn't know. Sorry for the punning. I couldn't help myself.)"
2,very disappointing,I was very disappointed with the bad quality of this product. I had hoped to get a quick reference on footnoting and bibliography with specific examples. It is a rehash of the APA style guide with no value. I already have and use the APA syle guide.
1,not what I expected,It didn't provide any useful information that I already knew. I wish I could return it because it was a waste of money.
4,APAMLA QuickStudy,Very helpful for the novice. Provides guidelines on how to properly setup document to be in accordance with APA guidelines. Provides other guidance in the area of APA/MLA.
2,Not for me,"I thought this would be a quick and easy guide to the APA format, but unfortunately I found it hard to follow. I ended up returning it, and using another resource ""APA: The Easy Way!"" which I found to be much more user friendly."
4,Great guide,"ths quick reference for student comes in handy when writting a paper, especially when you have multiple classes were you have to go between guidelines."
2,Sweet Info,"The book is an easy read, and rather vague. However, the book does refer to websites where you may be able to find more information. I would've liked a little more details. Half of this book is the author's bibliography. The book itself is only 100 pages. So go figure, that makes only 50 pages of information. In my mind this does not qualify as a book, but rather a handout.The value in this book is the referral to the websites."
3,It's just ok,"A good book, nothing special, it contains interesting facts but they're easy to find online for free, just search for ""honey uses"" or ""honey properties""."
5,GREAT!,A very informative little book about the medicinal value of honey! It is definately an eye opener . . .
5,Great Stuff,This is a great product. It does what it's supposed to do. I had a very hard time finding it so I went to my VERY favorite online store - Amazon. Got it for a great price as always. Thank you Amazon.
1,Poor Packaging of Shipment,Poor Packaging of Shipment - Lost 1/3 of the bootle due to loose cap on the bottle that acually fell off.The product is fine and works as advertised. Makes hair nice an full. It gives the hair body.
4,Will Come Back to This Store for This Product,"I have been using this product for so many years. It is an excellent product!! It keeps your hair curl. On the other hand, it will not harm or hurt your hair texture. Thus, no sticky feeling at all even though you don't wash your hair on the second day after you used this product...=PFor processing order wise, it takes a little bit longer than I expect, but product came in as if and also in excellent condition. The price and shipping are reasonable, too."
2,NOT Prime,"I have to give this product only 2 stars, as an average between product quality and service. This product was listed a ""Prime,"" meaning that it should have arrived within two days. Instead it took 5 days. While that is not a long time, it is still a FAIL. Regarding the product quality, I would give it 4 stars. I put it on while my hair is still damp from the shower, then let my hair air-dry, and then run my brush through it after it has dried completely. I have rather dry and thick hair, and it leaves my hair shiny and soft, exactly what I was looking for. Very tangle-free, too."
4,Iso Bouncy Creme 8.5oz,"This is a good product. I even use it in my twenty three month old grandaughter's hair at bath time when she is visiting, and her hair goes into corkscrew curls that hold and hold. It doesn't have quite that effect on my fine,thinning hair,but it helps it a little. I guess there are no miracle products out there for aging :)."
2,Not crazy about it,"I was not impressed with this product, I has an unpleasant smell and didn't do much for my hair. I was hoping for more definition and less frizz but didn't really get either."
5,This is a must-have that I'll keep re-purchasing!,"I've always been a person who wore my hair up in my bun for years, because I couldn't stand the frizz and dullness of my hair. After coloring my hair, I was recommended this product through my hair stylist to style my curls and eliminate frizz, and let me tell you, this product is great. It leaves my hair soft with no frizz. It also leaves it touchable...unlike some gels and mousses. I've tried everything, and this makes me actually like my hair...which is a miracle. It's great for curls :)"
1,"Had high hopes, so disappointed","I had read about this product so many times and could not wait for it to arrive! I have thick curly hair that tends to be too dry and frizzy on the ends and read great reviews and suggestions for use for this product as well as the defining/ texturizing creme ( which I also bought to use on my ends). I have tried it several different ways, on wetter hair, just damp hair and on drier hair and all I get is hair with no shine, very straw like and a bit tacky/ sticky. God I wanted to love this..."
2,"Smells good and makes hair soft, but too soft!","I have very curly kinky hair and have spent my whole life looking for a miracle. I have used pretty much every product under the sun and have never found a product that can define my curls and eliminate frizz without making it too crunchy. This product is no exception. It smells awesome and feels very soft, but it is too soft. The directions on the back said it will define curls while eliminating frizz. It does neither. My curls are very curly at the roots and stick straight at the ends after using the product, and once it dries my hair is a frizzy mess! I was using Catwalk Curls Rock before this and I liked it but thought maybe it was time for a change, now I think it is time to change back. The only thing that I like about this product is the smell and that my hair isnt crunchy after."
2,under-powered,"I had to return a Stanley TRE550 Staple/Brad gun because it could not set a 5/8"" brad in pine or poplar. I ordered the ""heavy duty"" TRE650 witch claimed to handle up to 1 1/4"" brads. It appeared to be a really nice unit, easy load, good safety, and variable power. Well I had to crank it up to full power to get it to set a 5/8"" brad in white pine and it came up just short of setting the 5/8"" brad in poplar. Stanley has long had a reputation of quality tools and I own many of their products but their power staple and brad guns are pitifully under-powered. I plan to return this unit and purchase a numatic unit."
1,Worthless junk,"Congratulations to the previous reviewer who had a relative good experience with this tool lasting half a cartridge of brads.Mine managed just three brads...The first brad blew the main fuse in my circuit board, yet the tool is rated at 5A.The second and the third 25mm brads didn't blow the circuit board again but they weren't driven all the way in a piece of softwood despite the power switch turned to max.And on the fourth pull of the trigger...well nothing happened. The power was on, the fuse in the plug was good, the on/off switch was on....it had just died.So my advice is AVOID. You'll only have to return it."
1,Stanley TRE650 Electric Brad Stapler,"The TRE650 is worthless,would not drive 1 1/4 brad all the way in.very little power,more like cork gun!Before purchase there were many negative reports but didn't listen.Thankfully Amozon has a very generous return policy.This item should be delisted,it also quit after 1/2 load of brads."
1,Is This A Joke?,I bought this nail gun to install moulding in my master bath. At the highest setting I could not shoot a brad through quarter inch moulding into pine baseboard. I can't imagine a job this tool would be good for. In the future I will buy or rent an air-driven setup.
1,Broke the first day,"If you want this brad nailer for a one-time use, don't buy it. it is complete junk. Fortunatly the seller gave me a full refund, and I did not even have to mail it back."
2,Works-ish some of the time,"Brads will commonly bend and it doesn't have great force. This is in part to be expected from an electric nailer, though it still happens far to often and commonly brads have to then be further nailed in."
2,What should be a nail gun,"I was looking for a nail gun that doesn't require air. And after buying this one, i still haven't found one. It can't drive 1 1/4 nails in hardwood at all. maybe a 1/4 inch. What good is that? It did drive a 1 1/4 inch nail in SOFT pine a inch. Still, what good is that? I am sending this back. Everything else about the gun is ok. It seems to me it needs alot more power. This gun is no good for what i need. I gave it 2 stars only cause of the way it's built. and an effort to stanley for trying. NEEDS MORE POWER!!!!!!!!"
2,It's Okay,"How do I say this.... well - if you want to replace your air compressor nail gun with this... forgetaboutit.This is more of a arts and craft nail gun. Not for nailing anything substantial. I tried using this to install some simple floor moldings, no more then 3/8"" thick pine. I had to use a hammer to finish just about every 1"" brad I nailed in.It worked in a sense that it started the brad, and held the molding in place for me. I would nail a brad every 12 inches on the entire molding. Once I finished, I just hammered every nail completely in after.Most likely will be returning it."
3,Disappointed,"Perhaps it was just the unit I purchased, but while loading the brads, a piece of metal flew out of the cartridge.We couldn't figure out how to put it back in, and I returned the unit."
3,A woman's POV,"This nailer doesn't completely set the brads as stated in other reviews. However, I am a woman and appreciated the nailer's light weight, especially when I was on a 10 foot ladder. It was easy enough to set the brads by hand."
1,Dead after less than 50 nail,"After about 20 nail the motor quit, I let it cool down, but after another 20 to 30 nail, the motor burn out."
1,Stopped working pretty quickly,"After the first 20 or 25 nails, this nailer just stopped working. It looks like something went haywire with the metal slide that drives nails. First, it just hung loose, then it froze and wouldn't move at all.Up to that point, the machine seemed fine, with useful adjustments and convenient functioning. But it turned out to be of no use at all."
3,Ideal for small children,"I am using this book to teach my 9 year old Visual basic as his first programming language.He has previously had some nonformal experience with VB ( simple games, animations etc with VB ) I find that the Bradley book is ideal for him. It covers the mildly boring bits of VB fairly well.( meanwhile I am teaching my 13 year old Scheme , his 3rd programming language)"
2,Difficult to follow and confusing,"I have been using this book for a college level vb course. Although it offers some good information, the examples were few and far between, difficult to follow, and we ran across numerous errors in the text and in some of the exercises/examples. I would recommend using the Step-By-Step books -- they seem to be more logical and comprehensive."
2,Confusing with Many Mistakes,I recently used this book for a class and we found that the book was not clearly written. Examples tended to be quite different from the end of chapter exercises. I found that you constantly needed to turn to outside resources or use trial and error to achieve your goal. The book also does not use the most efficient methods of doing the programs. Disappointed that errors were not corrected before publication.
3,It is a book for beginner who are willing to be tortured,This is the first book I read about computer programming. I have no problem understanding the concepts introduced by this book. But the errors in the programming examples make this book a very frustrating one. I do not recommand this book for these who want to learn Visual Basic by themself. It is a good exercise for someone who knows VB to find out errors in this book.
2,Old!,"I purchased this book thinking because it is new that it would be based on the most recent version of Gnome but it is based on an older version one I recognize as the version that accomponied Red Hat 7. As i rechecked I had noticed it showed the date of publication 2000, and thus realize this is my mistake. I would only suggest this book if you are using an older version of GNOME."
4,Compared to Rogue Spear...,"I bought this after playing a lot of Rogue Spear. There were some things I liked, and some that I didn't. There are a few things that I really like-1. SNIPING! You're outdoors most of the time, with big maps and plenty of opportunity for sniping. That was one thing I really missed in Rogue Spear.2. Kneeling and LYING PRONE!3. The new dynamic planning feature.. You can plan your waypoints in the field instead of doing it all beforehand.My opinion- If you liked Rogue Spear, then this is a great addition to your game collection. I still play Black Thorn and Ghost Recon a lot, interchangeably, depending on whether I'm in the mood for CQ combat or Ranger-style field combat (SNIPING!!)..The only reason I give 4 out of 5 stars is that I'm an SQA engineer and could rant to these guys about the things they need to work on. Its still a very good game."
2,Not even as good as thier previous games.,"I bought this game hoping it would be a sequel to Rogue Spear and Rainbow Six, boy was I wrong. Ghost Recon is just a dumbed-down version of those games. This game seems to be a response to Wolfenstien and other run-around-and-shoot games. Rogue Spear was more realistic, had more weapon choices, better control for your own soldiers, and was a LOT more detailed. Rogue Spear took planning, this game is just about running around and finding the bad guys. I found Ghost Recon to be far from life-like. Many times the enemy was able to spot and kill my men from very far away, the grass and trees didnt hide my prone troops at all. Ghost Recon has a few features I do like: going prone (and crawling) and better graphics, but graphics dont make the game. If you want a true point and click, first person shooter with some squad control, get this game."
2,Too difficult/complicated,"Sorry folks, but I thought this game was a little too difficult to play (or even ""survive in"").I appreciate the need for realism. But for me personally, there is a balance between realism & ""play-ability"".I'm not into ""puzzle-solving"" as much as I am ""shoot-them-badguys!""Don't get me wrong; I'm not some e-wussy who only plays Pac-Man on Sundays - I absolutely LOVE both Wolfenstein games (early 1990's as well as 2004(?).) When it comes to blood & guts gore - the first Soldier Of Fortune game was sheer heaven (please see my review), and ""SOF2"" was great too (albeit LESS violent, alas).But Ghost Recon is too darn complicated to learn, the controls are rigid & not configurable - and I get killed too damn fast!One last note - When I gave it two stars I was being generous. Now that I've reconsidered, I cannot downgrade it to one star, but I would if I could.Long Live The UnderAchievers!!!"
1,Dissapointed,Very good and realistic graphics e.t.c.. but in a moment of madness the Developers decided to use a Gunsight out of a Space adventure. This for me destroys all the illusion of realism. I have never seen a Gun on Earth that has a Sight like the one in Ghost Recon.
4,The Outsider,"I found the Outsider to be a fascinating book, one that really opened my eyes to the problems encountered by those suffereing from mental illness and schizophrenia. The son's journey to understand the father and piece together the last few years of his life is heart-wrenching and the reader truly sympathizes with his pain and anguish. A terrific book that I heartily recommend."
5,A Courageous Book! An emotional read.,"This is one of the best books I have read. I have so much respect for the author's ability to explore and map out so eloquently the haunting journey of his schizophrenic father. As another reviewer here pointed out - there needs to be more books like this and there needs to be more attention brought to this book so that more people learn the truth about severe mental illness.Reading ""The Outsider"" allows you to enter a world few people understand. This book hits the reader on many different levels of thought and emotion. You are provided an in-depth look at the world of a clearly sophisticated and intelligent man whose illness takes him to the outer realms of society. The book also brings to light how the severely mentally ill are overlooked in our society.Mostly though, this book represented to me one man's strength and courage to take a close look at his father's illness and openly express his feelings along the way."
4,A necessary book on a terrible disease,"This book is absolutely necessary. Not only does Lachemeyer tell a compelling story of his own journey, but he tells a story about an illness that is often relegated to the shadows.Schizophrenia affects over 1 percent of the world population. And, untreated or badly treated, it leaves not only it's victims ravaged, but loved ones and families as well. This disease can and does ruin millions of lives and may well be our number one national health care crises. Anyone who thinks that schizophrenia and its aftermath have nothing to do with them need only ask two or three friends if they know someone with this horrible disease. Odds are they do.The saddest thing of all is that what happened to Lachenmeyer's father is a terribly common occurence. Nathaniel Lachemeyer deserves great praise for taking this journey, putting it on paper, and allowing us to read it. May it open the eyes of a nation."
3,More than needed,"This is listed as an extension kit. Really it's a complete new chain, along with an extension bar for the track. The price could have been kept down by giving you only the extra chain needed for the higher door. Also, why fill our landfills with a brand-new chain assembly? Yes it works, but why the waste??"
4,Where did Amazon get its price?,The price of this is $32.99 and the prices of the door openers are significantly less on the Chamberlain site than those quoted by Amazon. It would be nice if Amazon didn't inflate the prices in order to make it look like they are giving a discount.This extension does work as advertised -- whether bought from Amazon or directly from Chamberlain.
4,Better product description needed Amazon!,"This is an extension kit for an 8-foot tall garage door, _not_ an 8-foot long extension as implied in the description. In other words it lets the opener work with a taller door than the standard 7' size. It will not extend the door opener rail to work with 10' or 12' garage doors.That said, the parts are well made and do what they are supposed to do."
4,good and working,installed successfully with my opener. easy and just works as expected. I think this is exactly what i expected in the beginning.
2,The one pictured is not what you get.,The one I got was (a rectangle) tubular. It did me no good so I returned it for the one picture and again they sent the tubular one. Time to update the picture
4,good bood,"good reference book, has some great simple ideas for getting organized. Not a long read, just quick steps to get started."
4,Great for the Money,"This was a great little book with lots of tips and information to get started on organizing yourself and your surroundings. It also gave you some ideas about how to get the kids involved. There were things you could do in just one, five or fifteen minutes. All in all, it was easy to read, and if you are wanting to get yourself organized, this just might help. Of course, you have to have to have the desire to do this!"
1,Basic information,"I probably wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. Only someone very new to any kind of organizing could possibly benefit, a teenager perhaps, but there is much more useful information out there."
3,Just what I needed.,This WAS exactly THE book I was looking for and at the right time. Perfect for getting my whole house in ORDER! Thanks. I'm about half way there!
3,vincent,"There are a lot of good suggestions. The book is quite disorganized, however and jumps around. I didn't like the snippits of information. It left me with the impression that I need to devote days towards cleaning up and organizing and many hours to maintaning the organized status"
3,Not the Best & Gets Repetitive,"Not as good ideas as Goal Sticking: How to Go Beyond Goal Setting and Get on the Road to Success I read both books recently, and I would say that this is okay, but not the best. I liked Goal Sticking better because it was about developing life long habits to get you to stick to your goals and stay organized.The author provides 500 tips on how to stay organized and I see the benefits of that method. Its effective since I can choose to immediately use these 2 tips and then go back to the other ones later.The main problem I had with this, is that after awhile, all these tips are variations of previous tips and I basically paid for a couple dozen useful tips, and hundreds of clever rewrites.Overall, 3/5, neat little book with a couple dozen helpful tips, but I've read better."
4,Windows Home Server Capable,"This is a discontinued Intel board, but I bought it new, in sealed box. This makes it cost effective at $45. Works very well as my Windows Home Server platform. It does not have on-board integrated graphics, nor an RJ45. It has 7 PCI slots total which makes it versatile to add yours. It recognized my MSI GeF8400 VGA and Broadcom 10/100/1000 NIC instantly on first power on. No native RAID; 4 SATA. It is an Intel, so everything was very easy to setup and works right the first time. I do not recall ever needing the Intel CD to get it up and running."
3,MOBO,Had some problems with bent contacts upon receiving the board. This was resolved rather quickly. Product performs as stated in info on board. Would recommend if asked.
2,A waste,"so I've been slowly making my own personal PC for the past year using intel d915pgn motherboard as the foundation after hooking up everything the damn thing doesn't work. Online troubleshooting and tech support confirmed everything is connected properly (keep in mind the motherboard was grounded)I decided to remove everything and reconnect it then one of the sodders falls off now im pissed. fighting the temptation to snap this piece of crap in half, i need to buy a soddering kit just to try to salvage it, or buy a new motherboard probably the same stupid model just so everything can fit properly..... :-/"
1,The motherboard doesn't work,"I bought the motherboard because I was one of the same make and model that yielded a failure that would not start, I just lit LED 5V. When replacing the new motherboard still gives me the same fault and I have replaced PSU and tested the memory, video card, HD and CPU. This is quite disconcerting."
4,Pleased with Motherboard,Item functions as expected. Make sure you are purchasing this motherboard for a mid size tower not a mini.
1,Intel flawed design,"This motherboard (and all socket 775) motherboards that INTEL produced,Do Not have any CPU bracket standoffs. This was done so one wouldhave to purchase ONLY an Intel CPU RETAIL box. OEM cpu's fromIntel do not come with the bracket. It is impossible by all means toinstall ANY CPU without a bracket and standoffs to snap the heatsinkunto the CPU. We have many of these mobos (that gather dust) dueto this flaw that INTEL deliberately did (this). We switch to AMD-onlymotherboards after realizing their scheme a few years ago. Lookat this motherboard closely and you see 4 holes around the CPUsocket (where the bracket should be installed). Amazon.comhas been blocking our reviews on INTEL motherboards - and wewill see if this one is posted (if it is, there's always a waiting competitorready to receive our business).Daniel James Tyler (The Walters Judson Group)"
5,an excellent and affordable intel motherboard,"I strongly recommend it to all people looking for an affordable major brand motherboard, as for instance: this (intel)."
4,Bring back the Brazil nut moisture mask.,I am in love in with this body butter it's rich and makes my skin feel like butter especially since I have eczema it's perfect for the winter. But what I don't understand why they stop making the brazil nut moisturize mask for the hair. I really want them to bring it back it's the only thing that works on my curly hair. if you agree with me please click on the link bellow and sign the petition to bring it back.[...]
2,Nothing special,This pan is ok...It's hard to clean and a lot smaller than I thought it would be. It is nice and sturdy though
2,earrings,The website shows a turtle earring with a stone and I received red enamel turtle earrings. Not what I thought I was ordering.
5,clipper parts,"Glad I could find these parts on Amazon. I hate to buy a new clipper, when all I needed was that part. Affordable and came quick.Thanks!"
3,Rantings and Ravings,"This is a good primary source about on how Rhodesia became Zimbabwe. However, the source is a bit slanted so it is hard to take seriously as scholarship. Of course, he could do things better. Of course, history would have vindicated him if he hadn't been betrayed. What Smith misses is that he wasn't a bystander, but an actor in his own right."
4,Ex-Wolfe Tones member sings history lesson,"Derek Warfield made his name in the annals of traditional Irish balladry with his singing, songwriting and mandolin playing for the Wolfe Tones (who are continuing without him). For Legacy, his first solo disc, Warfield didn't stray far stylistically. There are still plenty of ballads about various people and events in Ireland's troubled history, and he augments them with essays on each song. Indeed, you'll spend nearly as much time reading the booklet as listening to the music. Sometimes it all seems a bit heavy-handed and overly serious, but it's safe to say if you like the Wolfe Tones, you'll enjoy Legacy (and his second disc, too)."
1,Appalling,"I am a BIG PSB fan...and before anyone judges, I like a wide range of music. This has to be the worst collection of PSB covers I have ever heard. I can't even begin to describe how bad this is. Two songs stand out for me as the best, So Hard (mainly for it's ... silliness) and Jealousy which is in fact sung beautifully here. The rest is pretty much plain awful...."
2,Stick to the Originals,"Tribute albums are interesting for at least one of two reasons:1) They provide worthwhile new interpretations of existing songs.2) They confirm that the original singers were not merely fine songwriters, but also very good singers and/or arrangers.Like the tribute album to Elton John, this definitely falls in the latter category."
4,Great Here and There,"Im a PSB's fan and a Human Drama fan and I was skeptical of this cd, amazingly enough it is quite good. Im glad to see lot of the bands on here doing the songs in there own style. There are a few songs that disappointed me but for the most part it holds together nicely. And for those who say, ""im the biggest PSB fan in the world,"" and then trash this cd, have you seen Pet Shop Boys live? That can be pretty embarrassing too."
1,PSB meets SNLs Middle School Teachers,"This album is just awful.You know those two Middle School Teachers on Saturday Night Live that do horrible covers of popular songs? Well if they compiled an album of PSB songs, this is exactly what it would sound like.I'm a big PSB fan and I think the idea of covering the songs and re-interpretting the PSB lyrics is a great idea. After all, their songs are well crafted works of lyric ""art"". However, the other part of what makes PSB so fabulous is their attention to detail and extremely high production values.Unfortunately, these covers sound like someone took several English punk singers into a studio and backed them up with a Casio keyboard.Yuck. If I were the Pet Shop Boys, I'd be embarrased, not flattered."
3,It had its moments,"Being a huge fan of the Pet Shop Boys, I could not bring myself to give even a derivative work such as this a low rating. To be honest, many of the tracks are not worth listening to. But this tribute is priced low enough to make it worth it for the few solid and enjoyable tracks. Don't buy this unless you already have everything from the Pet Shop Boys as any of their albums or singles would be a better investment."
2,What have they done to deserve this?,"There are only a few good songs ...the rest, I cannot think in anything good to say.Pet Shop Boys did not deserve this..."
5,Susur Lee,"This book its all about creativity by a man who has been over looked for too many years as one of the worlds Top Chefs. This book is in one simple word ""Awesome"""
2,Some good points,"This book has some good points and some helpful techniques, but they could have been summed up in an article rather than a book. I would say do not waste your time but the book is a one day read and may be helpful. The used prices are not bad either. I was looking for something with more content and would have definitely bought a different book."
2,Where's the Beef?,This little book has little substance to improve memory. I found the book to be quite general and subjective and more directed to how the brain handles memory. There was little in the way of process or procedure that I found helpful in improving memory. Very disappointing book.
2,Not enough depth,"There are some interesting facts in this book, but overall I found it to be somewhat superficial. It covers a little on how memory works, a little on techniques for remembering facts (relax, pay attention, and make a list), and quite a bit on herbs and medicines. I imagine it would probably be most useful for a student needing help with study techniques, but it wasn't very helpful to me -- looking for some techniques to fight absent-mindedness."
5,An Action-Packed Page-Turner,"What do you get when you mix time travel, a Jewish man and woman who seriously disagree about their religion, the Apostle Paul, a dastardly fiend, and a prostitute?TRANSGRESSION.Randy Ingermanson has pulled off an amazing feat, combining these eclectic elements into an action-packed novel that readers of diverse backgrounds can enjoy. The characters are believable; the premise is fresh and twisting. And with a Ph.D. in theoretical physics, Ingermanson handles the questions of time travel with aplomb, masterfully weaving them into his plot.TRANSGRESSION is a rolicking, exciting read. This is a book I've recommended to many friends, and none has been disappointed. Fans of Ari and Rivka will be glad to know that Ingermanson plans more books in this series."
4,Good book,I've just started reading this book. It really grabs your attention and am looking forward to finishing it and the series.
4,It's A Ride!,"All I know is that I, as a reader, was standing with Rivka next to the apostle Paul; that surreal experience, along with Dr. Ingermanson's great ending make reading this novel worth the price of admission."
2,Disapointing,"I was really looking forward to reading this book based on the reviews . I was quite disapointed. I found it to be very simplistic in both story line and laungage. As well as being extremly predictable. I love novels about time travel and ""Jewish fiction"" is my weakness, but this book unfortunatly left me very unfulfilled."
4,An interesting twist on traditional time travel stories,"I really enjoyed this book. As a rule, I generally avoid Christian fiction, but the premise was intriguing. Being an avid history fan, I found that I became lost in 1st century Jerusalem rather easily. If the author decides to follow up with a sequel, I will be very interested in reading it."
3,"Good read, but not a top-notch page turner","Intriguing story line that had the basis of a really compelling story. For me, the technical details were a bit lacking and the latter chapters got a bit tedious."
3,1st Edition is Better,"As the owner of both the 1997 1st edition and this newer 2004 3rd edition, I am disapointed. In order to fit 7 years of new photos into the same size book, the photos were digitally shrunk and subsequently distorted and blurred. But worse, the 1st edition had 198 pages of photos, the 3rd edition has just 159 pages of photos. Bottom line, this makes the photos tiny, blurred and distorted. Also, the paper stock (thickness) was significantly reduced so although the newer edition has just seven more total pages, the first edition is significantly thicker and heavier. So if you do not collect Mattel Matchbox, purchase the 1st edition (also it does not appear the prices between the 1997 and the 2004 price guide have changed). By the way, the 1st edition is a great book!"
2,I don't like it.,I do not like the way that the book is organized. I was hoping for something with the models in the order that they came out. The newer models and older models are mixed on the page and there is no information under the pictures indicating what year that they came out. It has mostly newer models instead of the Lesney models that I am interested in. I wish that I hadn't bought it.
3,High Quality Book-Low Quality Useability,"Looking at this on the shelf, it is one good-looking book that I found difficult to locate certain series. I believe that the index in the back could be improved on, but I didn't give up on this completely and did spend some time getting familiar with the layout and organization. It is usable but you must be aware that there will be certain versions of the Matchbox cars that simply cannot be found, in any book. This isn't something you can unwrap, open and price a car on E-bay, but with some dilligence you can get a number on probably 85% of the collection that I have (which isn't extensive by any means). And a second opinion is always the best way to go.Not my first choice for a price guide, but I still use this as a second opinion."
5,Excellent Quality Made Product,"I needed a rivet tool to install my Window Regulator on my 2000 Ford Crown Victoria. The new Dorman Window Regulator came with 7/32"" rivets. I visited numerous hardware stores in town only to find that most Hand Riveter tools only go up to 3/16"" sizes. I thought I was going to have to pay hundreds of dollars to get some kind of hydraulic rivet gun to get the job done for such a large rivet. I was wrong!! This tool is VERY sturdy and is extremely easy to use. This tool can be operated with less effort than a staple gun. I wouldn't recommend using it for anything more than about 15 or 20 rivets as it could be time consuming."
3,Kazin will cause you to think.,"What do such diverse writers as Hawthorne, Melville, Emerson, Lincoln, Eliot, William James, Twain, Frost, and Faulkner have in common? Alfred Kazin maintains that it is a creativity born of each writer's inner turmoil over the issue of slavery. Whether God has anything to do with it is debatable, unless, of course, one is satisfied with understanding God as merely a synonym for the individual moral conscience. I'm not. But this does seem to be the underlying assumption of Kazin's book.Anyway, Kazin's point is taken. And it is left for the reader to decide if he's right."
2,Dull and unlikely,"Lordy, what a boring read. Maggie was immature and made incredibly unlikely decisions. Her friends were jerks. There was no sizzle to the romance: I was disappointed by every romantic scene. The attraction/romantic obstacle were unbelievable. No woman in her 30s behaves like that. Josh and his mother were OK, but the only redeeming characters in the book. I stopped paying attention halfway through this story. Skimmed to the end, with it's utterly predictable result. I do not recommend this book, unless you're just looking to waste a few hours."
3,Flirting with Disaster,"I enjoyed this story as I do all the other Woods stories. I think it would be wonderful to live in a little town (village) and close to the water. Sherryl Woods is a very good writer. I enjoy reading her books when I have read a very deep, complicated book and need some reading rest time."
5,Another good book,I am enjoying these books. They area fun read and you don't want to put them down once you start.
4,Flirting with disaster,"Good length, story moves along. Romance between couple interesting as it progresses. Changes in interaction between mother/daughter and father/ mother added interest to book."
5,Flirting with Diaster,I really loved this series. all of Sherryl Woods books are very entertaining and get you involved with the characters.
1,avoid this rip-off but there's an answer,"This is a cheapie and bad copy of an excellent film. Avoid this one. As another reviewer noted, there's a UK set of restored Fields films that I own and highly recommend. The label is Universal so no cheapie rip-off. Unfortunately, US copyright often gets in the way of even a studio releasing their own films. Getting the UK set is reason enough to look into a region-free DVD deck, one of the best buys I've made. My Pioneer cost no more than a US-only deck but lets me play DVDs from all over the world. Go to ""amazon.co.uk"", find the Fields set, and get a region-free played from Amazon. You won't regret it!"
4,"A fantastic, seldom seen Fields movie","I LOVE this movie, it's nice to see Bing crooning, and Fields is in top form, the classic story he tells of himself ""carving his way through a wall of human flesh"" is a real riot. Too many times folks get caught up in analyzing a film and fail to take it in for what it offers in pure, simple viewing pleasure. This film needs no in depth analysis, no stuffy analytic viewing. Sit down, watch and enjoy it for what it is, great entertainment that never gets caught up in taking itself too seriously.NOW...hello Universal...PLEASE issue a vol.3 WC Fields collection and include this in it. While this VHS version is good, a DVD done up right would be fantastic!"
3,very basic,"The book explain how to use very basic tools to teach with new technologies. But the tools are not very advanced: web, e mail, . It's a common sense aproach."
2,ATD metric nut drivers,"Asian sourced, these are a cost effective solution for an occasional user. Nice handles, but the shafts are carelessly mounted to the handles and are not always properly aligned.Grips are a two component type with a hard portion combined with a softer (the dark area in the pics) friction type grip. Sizes are marked in small letters on one side of the handle, as well as stamped on the blades.These are hollow shaft drivers (as opposed to solid shaft) for applications where that may make a difference.The actual drive portion of the heads appear to be well sized, fitting properly to the nut or screw head.Certainly not the pride of the tool chest, but serviceable.Acceptable rating, based primarily on low cost. Not a professional tool."
4,Ricky Ricottas Vs Mecha Monkeys,The books I purchased were for my grandson. after we had ordered them I told him it might take a week or two before they arrive. To my pleasant suprise we had them in less than 5 days. The books were in great shape and he is enjoying them. On a scale of 1 to 10 I give the vendor and the total operation a 9.5. Could not get much better.
5,Ricky Ricotta Books,"My 8 YO son was a HUGE Captain Underpants fan but he had read them all and needed something new. I bought the Ricky Ricotta books and he really liked them as well. He said they are ""not quite as great, but they are very, very good."" I would recommend these books to anyone who has a child who loves to read or one who is struggling. The author has a way of pulling the children in and they just sit and giggle through the whole thing!"
3,Small size noted vis-a-vis the short existence but not bad for the price!,A very interesting compliation of ALL the statsone would ever need on this third-rate ('AAA')Pro outdoor footy leauge from back in the mid-'70's. But the Ar.FL / USFL and CFL are/werewayyyyy better!
4,Looks good,Rhis is bigger than I thought. It is normal paper size. I was hoping it was smaller. But it looks good.
1,Paper quality is poor,"Maybe this is true for all notebooks sold in the U.S., but the quality of the paper is very poor. I can see through my writing from the other side."
2,Basics only. Advanced concepts are sorely lacking.,"My biggest complaint with this book is the lack of examples. Readers are shown only the simplest uses for commands, and are left to fend for themselves when it comes to complicated concepts. Command syntax is never fully explored, so readers are left guessing what else can be used besides the examples given. This book is average for teaching basics, but fails to hit the mark for advanced concepts."
2,Basic hand-holding text,"This is a text which covers the basic elements of writing AutoLISP code. It suffers from trying to start at too low a level (explaining, for example, how to use a computer) and pitches too slowly. The authors perhaps have not read Abelson and Sussman's ""Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs"". Although the advertising blurb claims that it covers all AutoLISP functions, it lacks in clarity of presentation, and has no function-by-function alphabetized reference listing. Given the paucity of AutoLISP texts, this is an acceptable book. Were there more sophisitcated texts available, it would be one to avoid."
3,"Returning for Inherited, or?","A very sense of a family story has been lost in swearing the characters instantly used to in between urinating and kicking at a toilet while a junior brother returned home after his dad passing away - to get his piece of assets, or?A work is good for improving the Aussie accent mostly."
2,Coming Home Again,"Sad man, sad town, seeking friends and family, relooking and rethinking old memories and relationships. Powerful portrait of the brother played by Hugh Jackman. While I saw it on VHS and not DVD, this should apply. There's a soundtrack CD also."
1,Battery review,I wasted over $100.00 and at this point trying to return products for working products would cost me more than new batteries bought locally. The batteries I received were missing a small piece of metal in the front of the neck of the battery that plugs into the charger (my older batteries had this small piece of metal. The batteries will not work in the charger and thus they turned into one use batteries. Makes me want to not order anything again from Amazon.com except books.
4,19.2v kawasaki battery,Receieved on time and works as advertised. Have only had a few weeks. But so far holding a good charge and tools running great. Very happy with this purchase.
4,Kawaski 19.2volt Battery,"Evidently retailers are not stocking chargable batteries for hand tools. They do sell battery powered drills and saws with one battery and one battery charger, but do not sell additional, chargeable batteries now. This is aggrivated by the fact that each hand tool may look like it may take a different vendors battery, however they are different and cannot be interchhanged mechanically or voltage wise. The only answer to this problem is to seek out a trustworthy vendor on the internet such as Amazon. Yes! Amazon comes thru again. They found rechargeable batteries,that matched my drill, so I thought it best to order 2 of them.The batteries arrived quickly, and I was able to finish my project. Thank you, Amazon.Jack C. LindsleySan Jose, Ca."
1,Buy the charger also,I chose this rating because you cant use just any kawasaki charger with it. You have to buy the charger that goes with the battery. That would have been helpful to know that. :)
5,Exactly what was needed,"This was the exact battery replacement that I needed, fit perfectly, came charged and works as it is supposed to."
3,Kawasaki 840045 Black 19.2-Volt 1-1/3-Amp Hour NiCad Pod Style Battery,All Kawasaki 840045 19.2-Volt batteries I have purchased have a short life span before cells start going bad. I have had 6 of this battery model.
3,Watch out - AUTO BARN substitutes items without notice,"The referenced (and advertised) item is NOT the item that was shipped. Without notice of backorder status or requested permission from AUTO BARN to ship alternative item number, a different item #691240 was sent. After inquiry with the shipper, they admitted that the sent item was a replacement for the other 'back-ordered' item. Research on the shipped item revealed that there was a factory recall for the shipped item 691240 due to 'possible fire hazard'. Via AUTO BARN, I requested a statement from the mfg.'r that the shipped item was equivolent to that ordered and that there was no fire hazard either. The shipper AUTO BARN has refused to respond or acknowledge my concerns. I have requested a refund or replacement for the correct ordered item. So far, no response. Reference AUTO BARN Order # 53345."
3,be careful,"Even it fits my drill and charger, they changed the battery pack. So there is no 3 contacts, but only two side ones. (the third towards the center battery which is on my battery packs 691034 is missing on this one).This means that my battery charger 690507 can not (will not) charge the battery pack.That is it.If you are more electronics savvy, i looked inside the battery what was actually changed. There is just totaly same inside (even exactly the same NICD batteries) with one exception - from minus pole there is a connection to the third above mentioned pole via some piece of small unidentified electronic device (condensator or resistor probably). So i took one from my expired battery pack and made it in about 15 minutes with my solder. It works now. I guess manufacturer wants you to buy new charger or the whole thing..... They have to eat i guess."
4,Good replacement,My other batteries that came with the tools died on me after about 2 years of heavy use. So far this replacement is doing well. Hoping this will hold up as well.
2,Below average,"My battery did not last two years and they no longer sell this drill with the 19.2V battery. The charger died first, then the battery died. It was a good drill, but the batteries and chargers are crap. You get poor customer support for these products. I will not purchase Kawasaki power tools again."
1,Not a good price for what it is,"4 years ago I bought the drill kit available here, but got mine at Costco for $42 plus tax. Drill, bits, 2 batts, charger, and carrier, but this one batt costs 3/4 of the total Costco kit cost??? Not a great deal for a batt that never did hold a charge well in comparison to Makita, DeWalt or Milwaukee. More like a Ryobi but not even that good. The kit is going to my local thrift shop soon unless I can find a good generic batt replacement or a lithium batt that will fit the drill. You get what you pay for, so get a Makita or similar brand instead of this junk."
4,ET Visitations,"This is a good book for people interested in ufos and abductions. The author has a good style of writing and lets the people who have lived through these experiences, speak for themselves in the book. Preston lets you make up your own mind about the cases, instead of TELLING you what they mean and forcing a particular point of view on you like a lot of books and authors out there (David Jacobs, Stephen Greer, and others).I for one recommend it."
5,Excellent!,I have always enjoyed Earl Grey tea because of the flavor of Bergamot. I was pleased to find that there is this version of Earl Grey with Double Bergamot which only enhances the flavor! I love this tea and believe anyone who enjoys Earl Grey will love this as well.
3,"A noble effort, but falls short","Most bagged chai blends aren't very good at all. There, I said it. There are a few that have authentic taste but are just too weak overall, and unfortunately, Stash Double Spiced Chai falls into that category despite hitting all the right notes with the spices.Upon opening a bag for the first time, I was concerned that this would be overloaded with too much cinnamon, but from the green stains on the bag it was apparent that they stuck a load of cardamom in there as well, which is a good thing. With milk and sugar, though, the black tea just did not have the strength needed to counter-balance the spice medley. Things improved when I added a second bag to the cup, but overall it was just too bitter and again, the BODY that you expect the black tea to provide just wasn't there. With a different or stronger tea base Stash could have a real winner here, because they certainly have the spice blend right on."
3,There's a LOT of bergamot in here!,"I love Earl Grey tea, so mistakenly thought double bergamot would be the way to go. Wow - this has a lot of flavor! Great for people who adore the taste, but a bit much for me. I tend to make giant mugs of tea, so I use one bag of the Stash Premium Double Bergamot Earl Grey and one bag of regular black tea for a perfect cup (for me)."
1,worst tea in the world,How this tea could get any stars is beyond me. I tried one bag and could not taste anything...you got it nothing. So next I used two bags in a cup to see if that improved the taste...still no taste. At my age I will not waste time on useless things so I gave the rest of my order to a friend who also enjoys Earl Grey Tea without my comment. The next day she asked if I wanted my tea back saying it was the worse tea ever!!!I will bet they do not publish this review but hope they will.Do not buy this tea.
4,"it's got double the spice, but. . .","the tea itself doesn't seem hearty enough to stand up to the spices. What I mean is that even after waiting the right amount of time for my cup to finish steeping, I have a cup of chai that's spicy but not really strong enough for me. I don't like stuff toxic; that's not the problem. I think perhaps this tea is just not meant to be very strong.It's got a great level of spiciness, however, and it smells wonderful as it's brewing.Stash Company--how about just a titch more black tea in each bag? :-)"
3,Time for Tea,"roduct arrived timely. Six boxes. I sampled this tea in a resturant and it was delicious. Can't say the same for my purchase. Good tea, but not as flavorful as Bigelow."
4,Not a Very Strong Black Tea,"This black tea is not very strong; it's priced reasonably though. If you're adding a dash of milk into your black tea, this won't do. If you're drinking it as is, without milk or sugar; it's quite decent. Faint aroma, doesn't taste as strong or smell as good as Tazo's Awake. Nevertheless, pretty good value for what you get."
1,Doesn't even compare to other Earl Grey Teas,"This is a weak, bad, imitation of an Earl Grey tea. Even Bigelow Earl Grey is better, but Twinings is the best. Stash teas in general are weak and not that good, I especially dislike all the tea grounds in the bottom of my cup with Stash teas."
1,NOT organic,"I bought this because I thought it actually had organic ingredients- as the description stated. It does not. It's quite good Chai tea, but I'd rather drink organic Allegro chai tea (available at Whole Foods for close to this price) than buy this stuff. The good news is that unlike some teas on Amazon, this one is very fresh and has a good sell-by date. I ordered it only a few weeks ago, and it is good until 11/2012. So if you don't care about organic tea, and you want a nice chai with strong cinnamon overtones, this is a pretty good one. I really like Allegro chai- it tastes more balanced to me, and I was hoping the Stash would be like that, but it's not."
2,Peach Tea,"We found very little peach flavor in this ""peach tea"". It is a poor substitute for Twinings."
1,Black Pepper Chai Tea?,"I have been a fan of chai tea for a long time and occassionally will try different brands. In my book, a good cup of chai tea does not require sugar and cream, and has tastes of cinnamon, vanilla, and cardamon. I picked up this box at the local store because it was relatively inexpensive in comparison to most of the other brands. I also hoped that ""double spice"" meant double the tea servings. I was wrong. Like other reviewers have observed, the tea tasted very bitter. An extremely strong black pepper note seemed to overwhelm the rest of the spices. I have liked other Stash brand teas, but I was very disappointed with this one. Unfortunately, the box now sits in the cabinet collecting dust."
2,Where is the Bergamot flavor??,"I was expecting a lot more from a tea that is named ""Double Bergamot"". Some other Earl Grey's I have used have more Bergamot flavoring in 1 tea bag then this little tea in 4. Thus I am rather disappointed! Although for a regular Earl Grey fan this tea might be good, for the Bergamot enthusiast it is not recommendable."
2,Too much clove!,"There is nothing but a strong clove flavor to this tea. I have had better chai teas with more subtle flavoring. The Yogi brand is a good one. If you love clove, then this is your tea. Unfortunately, I don't."
5,Love this Tea!,This is a great tasting tea. I've had this before and couldn't find it in the stores so I got it from Amazon. The peach fragrance is sooo addictive that I simply have to have it every day. A dream come true for peach lovers!
5,flavorful....,"This tea (chai) has a great blend of spicy flavors (gingery, etc) in addition to being invigorating (yes, this is black tea). For me, all it takes is a little splash of milk and a drizzle of honey, blended in, and I am one happy camper!"
3,Not fond of smell or taste,"I purchased 3 different flavors of Stash tea when it was on sale at Sprouts after seeing the great reviews on Amazon. I must say, Stash makes mediocre tea. There's something about the aroma and taste of their teas that does not agree with my senses. Maybe it's the cloying smell of the bergamot in their Earl Grey. I prefer Twinings, especially their Lady Grey tea over Stash. Of all the teas I've tried so far, Ahmad's fruit-flavored teas are my favorite (especially the Peach & Passion Fruit Black Tea, but the mango is good as wel). Aroma and taste is amazingly refreshing."
2,Not a fan,"Not familiar with what ""chai"" tea is supposed to taste like but this tea tasted like stewed cloves to me Yuck.Got this flavor in a sampler box and, so far, it's the only Stash tea I've tried and disliked strongly. Some are better than others, of course, but I find this particular flavor really, really unpleasant, which is odd given my love for most of the spices listed on label. The problem is that the clove just overwhelms everything and that's about all I could taste, outside a touch of cinnamon. IMO, clove has much too strong a taste to be used beyond sparingly...in anything. Perhaps adding milk and sugar might've made it more palatable - might even be the way it's 'supposed' to be prepared, but one of the reasons I drink tea is to stay away from having to add sweeteners or milk to make it taste good. In any case, I can't imagine using enough milk/sweetener to subdue the overwhelming clove taste would leave any room in the mug for tea or water."
1,Really Bad Tea,"The first cup I brewed was awful. Nice bergamot scent but horrible BITTER tea taste. I tried brewing two more times using alternate techniques. But, still horrible BITTER tea each time. I will not buy this brand again."
1,The tea smells like a medicine.,"The tea smells like a medicine with Anise flavor before even brewing it. No one in my family could drink it as it has strong anise flavor. There is not even a slight trace of bergamot flavor... I called STASH customer service to see perhaps the pack was mislabeled, no one answered or called me back. I am sending this back."
5,Can't live without it!!,Love this brand and wouldn't buy anything different!! Spices are perfect! It's best with vanilla soymilk. Makes my day.
5,Addictive,"I have never cared for flavored teas. I'm not sure what made me try this, but I am so glad I did! It is positively addicting! The aroma is wonderful and it tastes even better than it smells. I have signed up with Amazon's auto-shipment to insure that I will never run out. Simply delicious!"
5,Manna from heaven,"Stash makes quality teas all the time, but this Peach Black Tea is simply the best. It makes a heavenly iced tea."
5,Stash Earl Grey Tea,Stash makes the best Earl Grey tea I have ever had. It has tremendous flavor and smells wonderful right out of the packet....this tea gets my day started right or is perfect before bed.
3,"I like this tea, but it does lack something.","I think it's like another reviewer said, it really lacks a good black tea body. I love the intense spiciness, but clove dominates. In fact, the clove is so intense, that it numbs my mouth half way through a cup. I don't mind because it reminds me of when I used to smoke kretek, but others might."
5,Tea Time?,"Our family found Stash's Double Bergamot in a grocery store, tried it, loved it --and lost it. Seems stores have limited shelf space and rarely carry ""specialty"" items like the Double Bergamot Earl Grey. If you like Earl Grey, you will adore the Earl with Double Bergamot. Very distinctive flavor. Unique! Thankfully Amazon sells the six-pack of this special tea, which we get on automatic delivery so we never run out. Priced better than the local stores."
4,Stash teas.,"Stash teas offer rich full flavors from light refreshing teas to the full body spicy aroma or the rich chai teas also comes in Decaf. The longer you brew the stronger, serve with french vanilla creamer. Enjoy.**FYI**Amazon offers these by the case of 6 boxes only. Not the individual box of 18cnt tea bags. Yep, thats 108 tea bags, to share with the office & family."
2,Too much cinnamon!,This cinnamon flavor in this tea is overwhelming. It really hides any tea taste. Would not buy it again.
4,Triple Bergamot,"I like this tea. Whenever I pull a bag out of it's foil envelope, i like to inhale the scent of the Bergamot Oil. Triple Bergamot ? Bring it on !"
5,"The Finest, Strongest Aroma, Best flavor, Longest Lasting Bag Chai Tea!","Just read the title, seriously. I am a tea junkie and love my Chai. After purchasing many from the local supermarkets and whole foods. I was sold on Stash brand for the powerfully good aroma and flavor they seem to provide in their teas. If you like very watery tea you may not like this Chai as much as I do. For me, one tea bag makes a quart of good tea!"
2,Stash tea can vary batch to batch,"I have, in the past, positively reviewed other Stash flavors, Ginger Lemon and Holiday Chai. Had a problem with the Double Bergamot tea once, but then a second shipment was excellent. But this Double Chai Spice has a strange chemical flavor. Tried mixing it with regular black tea because the chai seems to be lacking a tea flavor. I have tried other brands of chai and have made my own. There's something off about this - it's got a strongly astringent, bitter flavor. I wonder if it's because the spices are ground to a powder? The best chai is made with whole spices."
3,"Not strong enough of a Tea flavor, mostly smells good",I usually drink Twinnings earl grey. I opted to try something new and i love bergamont so i figured DOUBLE BERGAMONT would be amazing. Well this tea smells amazing but it is very very weak. I have to use 2 teabags vs 1 twinnings tea bag and seep it for 7+ min in order to get the equal flavor i would get from twinnings. I wish this tea was stronger in flavor not just in smell.
4,Taste before you buy,"A friend of mine raved about this tea and I love Bigelow Earl Grey Tea, so I decided to try it. Now I have six boxes of a tea I don't like as much as Bigelow. It is too candy-like for my taste; I like a bit more tea flavor. So I would definitely recommend trying it before you buy 6 boxes."
1,"It's not Earl Grey, it's garbage!","Doesn't smell or taste like the real traditional Earl Gray. Horrible taste! I guess people who loves it never had the real thing, the way you can get it in England. I personally find that all tea from this company is bad, but than again, I'm not an American and I do have different taste."
2,Too oily,"I enjoy many types of tea, the more flavorful the better. I received this in a sampler that I purchased and did not find it to be very good. It has a very oily taste to it. I will finish off the tea bags that came in the box but would not purchase this type again."
3,"still practicing, can not return.","the smell of spices from this tea is awesome, but the tea itself is weak, if you try to let it soak in the cup for extra seconds it will leave bitter taste,I tried to add a packet of lipton tea but the taste still bitter, soI'm still practicing with it, it also didn't work with half&half;, not much with coffee mate. nothing like the original or made from scratch.MY RECOMMENDATIONS: since it is huge quantity that you can't return, try one package from the store first and see if it works for you."
2,Too bitter,"I hardly order chai teai, then I tried Tazo chai tea, due to the nice reviews on Stash brand and cheaper price I went for it. Way too bitter in comparison to Tazo, I used almost 10 ounces of water and I wasn't able to finish my cup. It is very bitter!!! Be aware, and only buy it if you like real real strong black tea. As a matter of fact is more like black tea than chai.Keep in mind I am not a tea expert, but if I like a nice cup of tea, and never have not finished one, like in this case."
1,"If I could give is no stars, I would.","I LOVE chai tea. it is probably my favorite tea, and I love all the flavor in it. I saw Stash tea at my grocery store, and was seduced by the sleek, pretty box. I brought it home expecting a wonderful spiced chai, and all I got was a mouthful of cinnamon. It has a VERY faint chai aftertaste, but it tastes. like. cinnamon. Chai is not a cinnamon tea, but contains many flavors, with cinnamon used very sparingly, if at all. This tea is a complete and utter disappointment, and I will never buy this brand again.I actually did find a good use for this awful stuff. If you simmer it in cranberry juice, it makes amazing potpourri."
1,Tastes like fireballs Candy,"If you like artificial fireballs candy, then you will like this tea. Personally I hate fireballs, so this tea was a huge disappointment. My son didn't like it either."
4,Pretty good & refreshing though I have had better Spice Chai,Good stuff but not great.Better than the other brands I have tried so far.It probably needs a little bit more caffeine & spice kick to make it more flavorful.Next time will try the double spice chai..
2,"Just not that funny, even low for larry standards","Very interesting concept and framework for a movie, that is what saves this from a 1 star rating. Larry plays a bachelor, work alone health inspector keeping the city safe from unsafe food. He has a couple of bad incidents on the job, and gets an unwanted partner to assist. They have an awkward relationship, but somehow they get placed on ""the biggest case ever"" that culd effect the City Cook Off finals. Mayhem ensues.The movie is overall just aweful. Non-funny fart jokes, and an uniteresting set of characters. Poor timing and set up for a ton of puns. Donny is about the only funny character, along with the mother. Larry's stand up whityness just does not come through here. I found myself wanting to switch this off 30 minutes into it, but kept on watching in hopes that it would get better, but it doesn't. Save your money, borrow this from someone else who rents this. I hope you didn't see this in the theaters"
1,Not funny,This movie is not funny. I have long followed Larry and the Blue Collar Comedy Tour. Stick to that. This movie is stupid and very boring.
2,"Low, even by Larry standards","Larry the cable guy, star of blue collar comedy tour, blue collar tv, and various morning radio shows, has made an attempt at making a movie. Unfortunately, It would have been better if he would had just left it as a stand up act. Incorperating a stand up comedians work into a movie is a tricky task, and as with many, this movie failed as well. Just corny overall. Weak storyline, and I just did not find myself laughing, and Larry is a funny guy. So Unfortunately, the movie just didn't ""git r done"", so save your money and get one of Larry's CDs or stand up shows."
2,Expected Too Much..........,"I went out and rented this as soon as my local Blockbuster got it. I was expecting Larry's traditional gut busting humor, and ended up getting just a Ha Ha funny result. The worst thing was I was waiting through the whole movie for the ""funny"" parts and the next thing I knew the credits started rolling. If you expecting to see the best of Larry the Cable guy... Sorry my friends you will have to stick with Blue Collar."
4,"If you like Larry, you'll like this movie.","I moderately like Larry's comedy, and as a result I like this movie, This movie is definitely Larry doing his comedy in a movie rather than in stand-up. There were quite a few laughs throughtout the movie, more so than recet movies, but it wasn't a constant laugh riot. If you hate Larry, you'll hate this movie, and if you love Larry, you'll love this movie.Note that this is most definitely not a politically correct movie. There are plenty of fart and handicapped jokes, with a few gay ones tossed in as well. If you are offended by those jokes, you shouldn't bother to see this. Otherwise, you should like the movie just fine, but only the true blue Larry fans will absolutely love this movie. Thus, 4 stars."
1,SAVE 90 MINUTES OF YOUR LIFE!,"What a waste of film. I'm not a prude and can handle fart jokes with the best of them, but an ENTIRE MOVIE of fart jokes? If it's funny at all, it quits being funny very early in the film.If your idea of a good time is watching fart jokes, uni-brow women, or ""fat mamas"", than this flick is for you.For the rest of us, I suggest picking another movie...ANY movie.Sure, I knew what to expect when watching this one, but it didn't have me laughing at all.I like the Blue Collar Comedy group, so thought I'd give this one a try. BIG mistake.Save your time.Save your money.Save your life.'Nuff said."
2,Not Funny...,"After hearing all the hype about how this movie is an hour and a half of laughs, my husband and I decided we could use some of that in our lives. We had thought about asking our adult daughter and son-in-law to go along. I am so glad we didn't. There was hardly any laughter heard in the whole theater...so it wasn't just us. There was alot of bathroom humor(if you can call it that), off color jokes and genital references galore. I happen to like ""Larry the Cable Guy""but he was way out of his venue. Sorry Larry, 2 thumbs down."
1,Humor at it's fartingest,"Oh the times me and my friends laughed at the humor in this movie. Like the time the people FART! Oh lordy, I couldn't believe it! I mean, right in public? Or how about the other time the person farts!!??!! I mean, I thought it was funny once...but thirty times? Wow, that's humor!! Well, if you're a fan of Mr. Getting her Done you'll love this farting movie. It's the best farting time I've ever fartingly had. Fart.Wait til you see the DVD! Over an hour of deleted farts! Oh, I'm gonna wear that disc out!Fartfully yours,-Fart"
1,worst mvie in history,"me and my gf walked out, this moie was rediculous a movie based just off his hit'r done joke which isn't even funny. don't buy this, don't even rent this i'd rather watch an hour and a 1/2 of static on the tv."
1,The dumbest piece of @*&!@,"I try to watch everything, even stuff I hate, with an open mind. I never liked Larry The Cable Guy as a stand up comedian, even though he seems like a nice guy. Health Inspector is the one of the dumbest movies to hit the movie goers ever. Larry is rarely funny and all humour is about farting or male gentila. I honestly dont understand how people could enjoy this awful movie."
1,VIRTUALLY UNWATCHABLE,"It's obvious this embarrassingly, putrid failure of a film was just a hastily written rush-job, attempting to cash in on Daniel Whitney's 15 minutes of fame. This movie is so painfully unfunny the audience actually feels humiliated for the actors involved."
2,Even dumber than I thought it would be,"Having seen Larry the Cable Guy in concert I knew this movie would be stupid, but also expected it to be funny. It was stupider than I was prepared for and not as funny as I hoped. There is a mild attempt at a plot and a couple of humorous running gags, one involving Larry getting a female partner but because of how she dresses and wears her hair, he thinks she's a man. Some of the scenes between Larry and his boss are also very funny. And again, knowing it's Larry the Cable Guy, I expected fart and other bodily functions humor, but this movie was unrelenting. It was still making a variation of the same joke right until the end of the movie. At some point you have to move on."
1,Broken,Used DVD had a crack in it right in the center where snap holds it to the case. My DVD player can't read it.
3,HiLARRYous,"Larry the Cable Guy: Health Inspector was a hilarious movie. Sure, the funny parts were either jokes or bathroom rumor (like farts.) But it still is a good movie. Larry is a good actor in the movie and still is his redneck self. I think they should make movies with the other guys (like Bill Engvall and Jeff Foxworthy.) I think you should go see this movie. GIT-R-DONE!"
2,Take advice from a harpsichordist:,"Kenneth Gilbert's over-rated fame has mysteriously continued to grow over the years. This is attributed to his marketing skills, coupled with recording with the ""big boys"" in the recording industry. This is reflected on this album set compiled by Harmoni Mundi. As a harpsichordist myself, I find his playing to be continuously dry, boring, and extremely unmusical. His saving grace is the use of beautiful instruments for his recordings. I would advise ALL people reading reviews about recordings on Amazon.com to use caution. The 5-star reviews for this recording are certainly blown way out of proportion. I believe there are many other recordings of the ""Goldberg Variations"" more deserving of time and enegy of a general audience."
1,crown heights let down,This is a CD that is not worth buying at any price! Not only does it have only short versions of their songs but its also missing a few songs as well and i mean MISSING.

5,A roaringly funny satire of the Roaring 20s,"Can you imagine if Henry James and PG Wodehouse had collaborated to write a novel about the newly liberated morals of the Roaring Twenties? They didn't, but leave it to Edith! She came up with this laugh-out-loud farce about the Jazz Age in one of the last books she completed. Although it is available in PDF on the web, Amazon would serve its army of Wharton-holics well to make it available in Kindle format."
5,Outstanding Video!!,"I purchased this video for my children, ages 3 and 5, and they LOVE it. They actually go around quoting it. I think it is awesome that they are learning the FACTS about Christmas, and not just what society has turned Christmas into. Fantastic video. Props to Phil Vischer on this project."
3,Love the story and the information,"I loved the story and the information but the voices annoyed the crap out of me. My son didn't seam to notice and they didn't bother my wife, but the voices were so horrible. Other than that it was very well put together."
3,"Good info, bad puppets","If you're after a few fun facts about Christmas, this video is useful to a point. It covers why we have Christmas trees, why there's a star on top, why we celebrate on the 25th and other stuff like that. But it doesn't go very in depth and the puppets are pretty bad. What is up with the fake British accents? My kids wouldn't watch more than the first few moments. But I kept watching. Some fun facts, but that's about it."
4,What does Christmas mean? Is it Santa vs. Jesus?,"Phil and the people at Jellyfish Labs want to help us out with the answer to those questions. In a fun, musical, puppet-filled DVD, he covers everything from Santa and stockings, to hristmas trees and Hanukkah. He has old carols, new carols, Popsicle-stick theater and my favorite, Missile Toe. (You'll have to see it to understand.) He doesn't rid us of our North Pole Santa, but does connect him with Saint Nicholas, the historical guy who started it all.If you've wondered about these topics or struggled with how to answer your kids questions, it's a great new Christmas video to check out."
4,Great teaching lesson,"Wow! I really enjoyed the opportunity to use this video to explain Christmas (in the United States) to my children who are 6 and 8. It explained the different holidays associated with Christmas and why they all seem lumped together.There were a few things that left me puzzled and a little disappointed.1. While the information is excellent, the storytelling and ""acting"" are subpar (compared to VeggieTales).2. Why was the Indian a monkey?3. Why did Brother Louie (a black man) get voiced by Phil Vischer (a white man)?In the end it was a great tool to teach my children."
5,BUY THEM ALL!,"So informative and true. OUr entire family learned much more about Christmas than every before. FUnny too! My older kids ages 8 and 10 enjoyed it. But, my 2 and 3 year olds were not interested at all...did not hold their attention."
1,Poorly made knock off -- unreliable,"This is a poorly made knock off of MOABT, which is technically unlike anything before it! You WILL be disappointed!"
3,More fiction then history,"I shouldn't confused any one who might read this so I should write it straight out and states that this book should be regarded as a historical novel rather then a real biography. Its a very well written historical fiction and I would be bold to say that its pretty close to history - a history that most Americans or Europeans would have little or no knowledge. Having written that, I would say that this book proves to be quite an entertaining reading material and the author effectively captured the moment in history regarding this historical figure."
1,Hack as all get out.,Hillsborough is like the Dan Brown of Japanese historical fiction and I don't mean that in a good way.
1,Junk,I guess this was too cheap to be a quality connector. It snapped in half as I was trying to tighten it. Before I broke it the picture was horrible which is why I was trying to tighten it. Do not buy!
5,A must for an Ikea entertainment center!,This product allowed me to move back the Ikea Best Boas Cabinet almost two inches back. It is now flush to the wall and looks nicer. It also prevent putting downward pressure on the televisons jack. Well worth it.
1,Lost signal,"Before as this install I can receive my SAT signal normal, but I feel that the COAXIAL cable was suffering stress due to the tight against the TV and wall, this was the reason I purchased this product but my surprise was that when I connect to the coaxial then to the tv I lost signal and need to remove it again. Good Solution bad Quality"
3,Make it readable,"As someone trying to come up to speed in the field of dimensional measurement, I looked forward to getting my own copy of the Handbook of Dimensional Measurement. There may be much good information in it. I was certain before buying it that there was. After receiving - and trying to read it - there may be. But how to wade through long passive sentence after passive sentence, punctuated by grainy black-and-white images to get that information is the problem. True, Handbooks for reference should not be used as tutorials, but even so, Industrial Press could have edited the basic text for today's readability standards. The tiny section on coordinate measuring machines, with no discussion on programming them, was disappointing. However, if you want to know all there is about quality systems like hand held measuring equipment, profilometers, and fixed gages, this is the book. If you can read it."
2,Handbook of Dimensional Measurement,This book is not for the average reader. It uses extremely technical terms to convey simple expressions. Explanations such as thread concepts were over stated and confusing. I returned my copy.
1,Very Disappointed,"I received the Water Bottle and was very disappointed. The bottle and cap themselves are probably good quality - but there were no attachments. I thought I was ordering the bottle with hose and all attachments for enema use, etc. I think the product description was misleading."
3,"water bottle, not an enema system","The water bottle appears to be high quality. However, the product details insinuates that it is an enema system, but there are no enema attachments included. That was somewhat misleading and disappointing."
3,Back to the basics,"All I knew was that I wanted a water bottle, trying to get back to the basics and to save a little money in the process."
1,Vajrayana vs. Dzogchen Primer,"This book addresses basic preliminaries for Vajrayana (Tibetan Buddhism). It contains precious little Dzogchen--barely mentions Trekcho or Togal (primary Dzogchen processes). It doesn't even include some of the best approaches to Shamatha or any real exposition of Vipashyana (see Thrangu Rinpoche's other books for this). It also ignores Tonglen and Chod (excellent Vajrayana techniques, though not themselves Dzogchen either). Primarily it seems to be an apologetic for culturally specific Tibetan practices such as 100's of thousands of prostrations (I'd rather do Chod). It fails even as a primer. It is difficult to find a single book with the breadth and depth of Dzogchen (but, try The Practice of Dzogchen by Tulku Thondup). I think this book is misleading and of marginal value."
3,but i'm afraid...,i was only listening to the cello. speaker against my ear... infection. i was draining. but it sounded sweet...pure.
2,Misleading and Confusing,"I thought this was going to be a retelling of the story first told by Dougal Robertson in his excellent Survive the Savage Sea. But his son, Dougal, is incorporating most of the text from the earlier book, and is even writing from his father's point of view throughout this book. So 30 years later he's writing as his father to offer additional observations, which are now mixed in with his father's observations. I'm returning this book to Amazon."
3,Barley Bree Is Better On Stage than On CD,"I have seen Barley Bree perform live and truly enjoyed them, so collected all of their recordings. The fact that Tom and Jimmy Sweeney are Tommy Makem's nephews also influenced the purchases. In my opinion though, the songs get a bit monotonous to listen to. I have hundreds of Celtic music recordings, and while this is by no means the worst, it is not among my most listened to. There are some good songs on the recording, so if you have no other Barley Bree recordings, you may want to give it a shot. However, if you already have any of their recordings, unless you want more of the same, skip this one."
3,Just some info to Missouri poster below,"I have no comment on this CD, never having heard it. But for the person looking for sheet music to LORD OF THE DANCE, try the STEVEN CURTIS CHAPMAN GUITAR COLLECTION or STEPHEN CURTIS CHAPMAN FAVORITES. If that doesn't work, just look for the old Shaker hymn with basically the same tune --it's called SIMPLE GIFTS, and the music is all over the place in American folk/religious collections. The hymn also forms the central theme in Aaron Copland's APPALACHIAN SPRING. P.S. I do like Tommy Makem's version of this song."
5,One of the finest recordings of the year,"I can only congratulate Cecilia Bartoli for choosing this marvelous opera instead of recording another ""Barbiere"". Smart as she is, she found in Armida a perfect role for her. Christoph Pregardien, a most eloquent Lieder and oratorio singer perhaps lacks the operatic brilliance of Claes H. Ahnsjo in the Dorati recording, but considering how difficult his role is, he also deserves a standing ovation. Harnoncourt conducts with white hot passion, and his formidable orchestra is infinetely superior in every department to Dorati's good, but old fashioned modern instrument band. Can I enter a plea for ""Il Mondo della Luna"" and ""La Fedelta Premiata"" ?"
5,Papa Haydn would be very pleased,"Cecilia Bartoli must be congratulated once more for demanding the very best orchestra and conductor around for Haydn's Armida. Superb as Bartoli is in the title role, the finest thing in this recording is the playing of the Concentus Musicus Wien, they cover themselves with glory. As Armida, Bartoli sings with total commitment and panache, she sounds even more at home than Jessye Norman did in the old Antal Dorati recording. The tenors though, lack some of the brilliance of their PHILIPS counterparts, but still, they are never less than very good. In every other respect this new recording is to be prefered. The lovely packaging is marred by the difficulty of taking the cd's off, otherwise, this is a very, very desirable recording."
3,Haydn is no Mozart when writing opera,"Haydn, who reaches celestial heights in his string quartets and symphonies, is average in his opera writing, at least, compared with Mozart. The sound of this recording is lovely and Bartoli with her vocal gymnastics is always a joy to listen to. But, we are firmly on terra firma here - no soaring to the heavens. I have struggled to even get to the end of these CDs."
4,Informative,"Great reference to the work of Dr. Max Gerson. It is very informative and easy to read. I would recommend this book to anyone who is thinking of changing their diet to a more natural one, or to anyone with health issues. This book might just change your life, or even save your life."
5,A GREAT BOOK,"This book is a wonderful and informative read. I found the storylineportions to be riveting, especially the story of Dr. Max's escape fromthe Nazis. Additionally fascinating were the historical facts ofDr. Max's discoveries and disease-curing results and how they werereceived by the mainstream medical establishments in Europe and USA.The author's writing style is superb and very enjoyable to read.I think that all readers will find the book interesting and will enjoylearning Dr. Max's scientific & personal history and will recognizethe repeated chord the AMA strikes with regard to Dr. Max & the Gersondiet. Also if readers follow recent health news & studies, theyhave already seen many scientific studiesconverging on the basic truths of Dr. Max's discoveries.I strongly recommend this book and have bought copies for many friendsand relatives, and my primary-care MD... But in themeantime, please buy your own copy and read it. It's a great book."
3,Not what I needed,"If you want to play undercover cop then this book is for you. If you're looking for ways to heal and recover, keep looking."
1,not worth the money,"It seemed like the author could have found more to do with her time than think of ways to catch a cheating mate. If her mate was cheating, couldn't she just listen to her intuition and spend her time doing something worthwhile? Also, these are all tactics that we've known about for years. Not foolprooof, by the way."
4,Lamp,"I received the lamps .. We're beautiful great conditions, one lamp did not worked, I went to home depot and bought a replacement cord and lamp now works. Sent a email to black Tia company but no response ."
4,Very nice,"Ilike the lamp and it's structure, BUT i didn't get a bulb with if, pleasesend me one nowHelen Potts"
4,a gift for a friend,"i bought it as a gift and the person said they liked it. it is not in my possesion. this is why i dont writethese,,,,,,,"
5,Salt lamp,"This lamp is huge. It has beautiful color and is exactly as described. It's super heavy, and beat up the packaging pretty bad but remained in one piece."
4,salt lamp,"I was upgraded to a larger salt lamp because the shipment was late. I thought that was very nice of them and I had planned to purchase more in the near future. But when it arrived.....the light cord was too small for the lamp and did not fit correctly in the lamp. When I turned it on the bulb blew up with a bang. I am not sure where to get a cord that will fit it, but the lamp itself is beautiful, wish it was lit,oh well, accidents happen. I can't complain, when so many people in our world are going through real heart breaking issues."
2,Interesting but aimless,"I have gotten nothing out of reading this book. I am currently a student interested in diplomatic relations having some experience working in the White House and expected a down and dirty book about behind the scenes presidential diplomacy. I read nothing of the sort.This book bounces from issue to issue, following events as far as dates rather than consolidating the efforts of the president and Talbot into subject by subject chapters.I was also lost with names. He floods the reader with Russian names, mentioning there titles once or twice in the entire piece. This makes for very hard reading when trying to make sense of the various Vladmirs.Nothing can be truly learned from the book and would be much better suited to a Tom Clancy reader who is not expecting a plot."
3,biased account,"Although a great account of a tumuluous period in Russian history, the book is biased and unsympathetic to other independent states that emerged from the ruins of the Soviet empire. Talbot, along with his Russian counterparts, is incapable of seeing the ex-Soviet republics as independent entities that should and are capable of having independent foreign policy. Unfortunately, yet another example of Russian imperialism and the West's indiference toward the smaller states."
4,Great Condition and Speedy Delivery,Not only did I receive this book in a timley manner it also was in great condition. Thank you so much!
5,Kidnapping a General..,I'll be the first to admit that I like this movie and gave it 5 stars. If I were to rate it honestly it would be closer to 3 1/2 stars.....The movie is based on a true story (book) by the same title...AKA NIGHT AMBUSH. It's the story of a British Commando team and partisans on the island of Crete who kidnap the German Army commander and smuggle him to Egypt. Good covert ops type stuff and some minor shootouts...however the story is the plot to kidnap him and get him out......good movie and not to be missed.
2,Does not deliver $28 'hints',"As an Instructional Designer and a Technical Writer, this book did not deliver. The entire book is a list of terms and one person's tips to use them. It simply is not enough to justify the cost."
1,The author overestimated his own knowledge on the subject,"I finally decided not to finish this book beyond the 60% mark. Carey seems to have access to (from the Kindle edition bibliography) most of the broader modern scholarship on the subject, but must have decided not to use it, or might not actually have read it himself. There are also simply too many direct and glaring errors - simple, factual ones, rather than interpretations that are simply old-fashioned- for me to bother finishing this book.Don't waste your time. Carey is in over his head here, and students will only be introduced to a vastly outdated picture of medieval warfare, from an author that, in truth, should not have written a book on the subject."
2,BIA Cordon Bleu 23 inch Oval Fish Serving Platter white,Item had an imperfection on edge of platter. I returned and requested another. The second one also had imperfection. I was giving it as a gift and personally own one without imperfection. Maybe the mold was causing this? It was great service. Easy return. Not quite sure why they are now manufacturing noticeably flawed merchandise.
5,Classic Coulter with emphasis on his compostions,In this album Coulter shows his vocal abilities on selections he composed - they are hauntingly lovely and he sings them a bit like Rod McKuen used to . This is one of my favorite Coulter albums and he is my favorite artist.
5,Does what it's supposed to,"I stupidly moved my xbox while the game was in it and spinning and completely ruined The Orange Box. The game would spin but couldn't play it at all, just a bunch of purple and back checkers, weird. Wasn't sure that this kit would work because it just seemed too simple but for the money wasn't much of a risk. Was very surprised, game works perfectly now and I didn't have to remove a layer. Just used a couple drops and part of one cloth, cut it up so you don't have to wash/reuse. Very easy to use and repaired my disc perfectly."
5,It works!,"Sometimes buying the cheapest one does work! I use a CD software program in my classroom, and the cd's are always getting scratched, which prevents them from loading properly. This did the trick! Although, for some cd's, more than one application/a minute to apply was required."
1,"Doesn't fix a thing, but your disks look shiny!","I followed the directions religiously. I tried it three times on several disks with varying types of damage very light to heavy and this solution affected them in the following way: These are now the cleanest dvds I have ever seen. They do not, however, work any better. I have buffed the compound in, let it dry over night and even a couple of days and to no avail. If you want clean disks, it works like a charm but I suggest getting your own soft cloth so as to avoid adding more scratches with the provided cloths. I cannot imagine that this product has actually worked for anyone."
1,purchased but never played,I purchased this game because all my friends were telling me it was a great game. I purchased it and 2 days after it arrived I threw it in the trash.I assume it is a very good game.
5,A great flight simulation that is a joy to fly,"Developed by Eagle Dynamics, the creators of Flanker 2 , Lock On is a great simulation and a joy to fly.It requires a good PC (at least a P4 2.0 with 1024 MB RAM) and a 128MB video card (a GForce 5xxx or ATI9800) in order to really enjoy it.It has already been patched twice and has a great online community that creates missions, skins and campaigns that you can download - and Eagle Dynamics is already developing add-ons for Lock On.Lock on requires some time to master, but it is easy to learn and, as far as flight simulations go, it is quite intuitive.Don't miss it!"
3,PC Game,This is suppose to be a great game and if you can run it I believe it is. Unfortunately on my windows 7 computer with nvidia graphic cards it will not respond to the mouse. This is a system problem on my PC and not a defect in the game.
5,very fun,Me and my brother got this game and we love it but I dont like that I cant figure out how to change your payload and easy radar killes your missles otherwise great.
4,Lock On Modern Air Combat,"If you have the patience to get over the quirks especially if you own a Saitek x-52, this game is one of the best out there like MS Flight Simulator X."
2,What were they thinking?,"I have played,and owned almost every good military sim on the market since the year 2000 when I started becoming interested in turning my simple desktop PC into a full-blown, afterburning sim station! I'm also a commercial pilot so I am very critical about games that claim to be ""sims"" but are actually just games. When this game came out the reviews had me extremely excited about something that was supposed to be even better than Falcon 4.0! Yeah Right! If there is one thing that every serious sim must have it is a fully-clickable cockpit. I'm not going to try and memorize a couple hundred different key combinations for one sim! Sure the graphics are good if you can get the game to run at a descent frame rate, but we all know that physics, not graphics make a great sim. Falcon 4 and the Janes games are still king after all these years!"
1,Not worth it!,"This game is by far the worst flight sim I've ever played. I'm using top of the line processors and graphics card and the game play is still choppy at best. The technical data is top notch, but the flight controls have way too much lag time to be effective in basic fighter maneuvers. Trying to line up the CCIP with your target for Mk82 drops is almost impossible. The lack of a keystroke guide is a huge fault! Also, trying to read the instrument panel of the Frogfoot is an exercise in futility. Any of the Jane's sims are much better than this."
4,"""OMG?"" Was not comparing LOMAC to AC4",What an idiot. If you read the whole review (writer from Los Angeles on 12/25/03) you would understand that the review was not comparing LOMAC to Ace combat 4. They are two different types of games. That is the point I was making. One is an arcade and one is a sim. If you read the previous reviews you would see that someone was upset that LOMAC was not like AC4. That is why I made my point. When LOMAC works it is the best combat flight sim known to man. There is no comparison amongst flight sims. By the way I do have other things to do than sit around and read and write reviews. I'm just not doing them:-)
1,Not What you think it is,"This game is nearly impossible to play, you have to virtually be an actual pilot to know how to play this game."
3,a complete disaster,"OK..nice looking game but...I have Dell PC with Intel pentium 4 processor (1.5Ghz), 768 MB Ram and Nvidia Geforce3 TI200 and this game simply won't play on my machine. Keeps crashing my computer all the time, what a waiste of money, so now I suppose to buy an another PC for couple thousand $ just to play it? I have dozens of games in this computer uncluding operation flashpoint, Il2 sturmovik and lot and lot more, and had no problems at all playing them all on highest settings, untill this ""game disaster"" came out....don't waiste your money untill u get a top of the line PC, itherwise it win't play"
1,Air conflict,I bought this game used and it came with out instructions.or a manual. I checked the disc. it dose not have a manual either. the game shows you how to do some things but not others. like weres the throttle. I got brakes and flaps but no throttle. I checked on line and I quess you cant get one. so I have a game I cant play.
2,joystick problems!,"My computer was sit up from DELL to play games so it has plenty of muscle. The thing is I bought a Logitech Extreme 3D pro twist handle joystick that works wonderful on other games. But with lockon some things work and some things don't. No matter how you program the stick,and it crashes from time to time and you have to start the missions all over again. As far as tech support for the game they have no answers about it and thats after a long long distance call. There answer to the problem is log on line and ask sombody else for HELP!! The game started off very well and I was very disappointed when things didnt work out maybe things will go better for you but thats a chance I would'nt take.."
1,I Feel Abused,"Lets just focus on the fact that this game does not come with any kind of manuel. In fact, you have to buy the manuel for $30 more dollars. How on earth can a flight sim come with no manuel. How on earth can they actually expect you to pay extra for it. Flight sims are complex, involved, and require a lot of commands to learn and play the game properly. Especially this one. The game also requires a pretty high end system to run well, and not to mention its buggy release is completely pitiful. Don't buy this game. If software companies can release a game like this and make a profit, god only knows what we are instore for in the future. And as far as giving this game a chance, ok, wait till its price goes way down, they give us a manuel, they fix it, and the technology catches up. Then maybe it will be a good purchase. This is a complete abuse of a consumers trust."
4,"Good, but not great.","I've been messing around with flight sims since the days of the Compuserve Falcon Challenge Ladder and flying against aces like Victor ""Duke"" Z. When Falcon 4.0 came out, I was really impressed, followed by really depressed when Microprose/Hasbro raped and abandoned it.The out-of-the box experience will depend on how much effort you put into reading the manual, and setting up the game based on the abilities of your machine. If you're in a hurry and just want to blow stuff up, you might be a little disappointed.The graphics are nice, but not much better than IL-2 Sturmovik.The learning curve is there, but you have to remember what this sim is and what it isn't. It's not Crimson Skies.All-in-all, I'd have to say this is a very good sim with a lot of potential, but not as great as all the hype made it out to be a year ago."
2,"Poorly made, terrible controls,","Lock On: Modern Air Combat (LOMAC) is easily the worst combat sim made in the past 10 years, with awful controls, bad graphics and a rushed release it is the absolute epitome of lazy game design on a budget. You're much better off buy Wings Over Europe or any other Thirdwire sim as they have a better modding community and a very good mission designer/campaign system."
2,"best game ever ,with a few flaws","I am an serious and experianced fligth simmer.I have every simulaer and top of the line $100+ joysticks. I found this under a PC PILOT MAGAZENE ****star revue that lead me to buying this amazing sim.If you take the time to do the tutorials this game is aweosme, with realilistic AI and hundres of modes. But it has one major flaw that led me to e-baying it: you have to memorise tons of keyboard combinations to change to a difrent gun, from AIR TO AIR ,AIR TO GROUNG,CANNONS, ect. rent it of try a frends befor you buy. UNTILL THAN KEEP AWAY!"
1,"Lousy, out of date crud...","To say that this game does not run well because a PC is too slow is ridiculous. I have a top of the line, fastest PC available to date - 4GB RAM. 3.75 GHZ, best of everything.This game is crap. Although it runs on WINXP it obviously is not designed for it. This handles more like something for an old IBM PC.The few decent screenshots are JUST SCREENSHOTS and movies and stills do not make a flight simulator or even just a 'shoot em up'.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY, TIME or SANITY. I have had this game for 2 days and it is currently serving as a doorstop."
1,this is just a review of their ftp site,"I haven't finished downloading this game yet but their FTP site is really slow. And can only handle 325 connections. Thus the link from the web site to download it didn't work, I had to go and get it the old way G.I. Joe Style. And even now I'm only getting about 30-40K down stream. [GROAN] However the screen shots look really cool."
2,Locked-Up!,"Requires more than my P4 2.4 processor and 512 RAM can handle, even on XP. The graphics are good, even with the lowest setting, but the game has lots of bugs, causing lots of lockups, crashes and inexplicable 'blue' screens (see similar complaints at the LOMAC website) once I get beyond the simple quick combat missions. I had hoped for something more efficient from Ubisoft, considering how good IL-2 is as a flight sim. This is a disappointment unless they can come up with a substantial patch soon."
3,You had better be a real pilot to play this game!,"I purchased The Ultimate collection with Lock On being one of three games in the set! I was interested in Lock On as I already own Pac. Fighters and IL2 Sturmovik. I must say the game ""could have been super"" if they didn't make everything so complicated. There are many many key combinations to select radar, air to air and ground missles, locking on targets etc! Every time I select radar, I loose my ability to control speed of the aircraft with my joystick!! Very frustrating, you'd better be ready for some ""figuring out"" if you intend to play this game!"
1,"Lock On ""Disaster""","I have a pretty updated PC with 6 different flight simulator games. My machine has 1.6 Ghz 512 RAM, video card with 126 MB mem and this much advertised Flight sim. is not working. Takes for ever to load it. Once you in a flight mode there is no access to the necessery key stroke unless you get out of the flight mode and get back to the option window OR you memorize (I count it)139 differente key stroke variations. Hardware acceleration have to be turned of ect...ect. The joy stick can only be programed (it is pre programed)to basic flight movement. Everything works off the keyboard. It was an absolute waist of money. This PC game is a joke"
1,Can't believe I waited a year for this crap,This game will not run on windows ME. You will need something equivelant or better than big blue. You might then be able to get atari graphics.One big stink.
3,"Soon , this will be a great game","This game is about two patches away from being highly playable. The designers are world class and the game elements are excellent. It is a shame that this initial version does not yet work on PCs. It will take several patches to fix all of the bugs in the first release. We should all be patient and let this game fulfill its potential over time. If you are anxious to see what the next generation of sim games may look like, it may be worth the money buying it now for curiosity's sake - if you want to actually play the game, then wait to buy it until it is finished."
1,Should have stayed LOCKED IN,"After waiting for a long time, reading reviews and screen shots, I thought this would have been ""One of the all time best"" for a flight sim...well, I will not mention my experience / problems since some of the ""Real flight sim gamers"" have put it very nicely...but I will add that this is NOT a Janes USAF four years later...XP/2.8/128 video/512 ram.Yes, patches might improve this game, but that remains to be seen."
1,lock on air comat,"I don't think they make any bombs bigger than this,what a waste of money.Graphics great but that is all.I have a loaded new SONY pc but found this lacking any excitement or challenge.flt sim 98 as archaic as it is is a gem compared to this piece of crap."
1,A disaster,"Totally non-functional, with absolutely not one iota of response or help from the maker. This is the most non-functional piece of junk I have ever paid fifty bucks for with no apparent remedy or refund. Has anyone else had success in getting at least an acknowlegement from tech support? Very disapointing!"
