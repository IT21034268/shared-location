5,Trane's best record on Blue Note,"I honestly think this record is an absolute must for jazz-lovers. Lee Morgan, Curtis Fuller and of course John Coltrane tell us what the word music means. The inspiration is impressive, to say the least. An excellent record not to be forgotten."
1,Beware copy protection,This is not a standard CD. It's a special CD with copy protection that may not work properly in your computer.
5,Excellent,This album is a must for anyone remotely interested in jazz. The various styles and big names are what truly make this album a classic.
5,don't play cd-rom!,"Everyone knows this is a classic album. I would just like to warn against the ""enhanced features"" - at least on a mac. You have to install folders and it restarts your mac in ""classic mode."" The interviews sound like they're playing back at half-speed. You have to click on a heading every few sentences to continue and each segment cuts off in the middle of a sentence. There are no navigation controls. At the end of the interview there's no way to get back to the main menu. Your computer also freezes up so that you can't quit the program or eject the cd. If you click command-option-escape you can force quit the program and the classic mode but your computer is still set to a very grainy 8-bit display."
5,one of the best,"This is one of my favorite albums. It is amazing. Check out the ultimate blue train though. It has multimedia stuff on it. It has interviews with other musicians, a video clip, and more...very nice."
5,Great accessible jazz,"Absolutely love this album. I know most says that A Love Supreme is his best album, but I really think this one is. Every song on here is a classic and it is a bit more accessible to the everyday listener. A Love Supreme is a must for jazz lovers, Blue Train is a must for music lovers."
2,This Train Left the Station a Little Early,"Unless you're a John Coltane fanatic/collector, you'll miss nothing of importance by not passing on this really quite pedestrian blowing session. The lineup seems impressive enough at first glance, but the session wound up as a perfunctory-sounding changes run by all involved - - aside from John's solo on 'Moment's Notice,' there really isn't any magic here. Jay Jay Johnson muddles through the tunes on trombone along with Coltrane and the rest of the bunch, and the tunes themselves even seem to lack zip - - even the title track lacks drama, and clocks in at an obscene length for such a bland performance. I'm not saying it's terrible, and it does offer a few fine moments in addition to the reliably solid blue-note sound, but if you really want a Coltrane from this period, go with the Coltrane/Hartman album, or skip ahead to 'A Love Supreme,' by no means a straight ahead offering, but one with some real juice just the same. - - George McCoy"
2,NOT A TRUE DVD-A!!!,"This is not a true DVD-AUDIO... normally, the point of a DVD-A formatted disc is to remix the original album in 5.1 surround, playable on dvd-a players or dvd players with 5.1 surround sound.This is NOT the case... this is merely a higher quality recording (higher bit-rate) disc of a classic coltrane album.If you don't already own this album, you should get it. but if you already own the ""regular"" cd, this is not what you probably want."
1,I hate it,"John Coltrane along with Miles Davis and the rest of them ruined jazz. They're just so random. I mean, come on, 5 year olds could play this music.Jazz was headed in the right direction with Glenn Miller and the rest of those brilliant, gifted pop-jazz musicians. Jazz then went spiraling into the ...for 40 years, until Kenny G came along with his perfect, soul-filled solos and such. Oh, he's just heavenly.So, as you can see, I have really poor taste and you should want to disassociate yourself from me and buy this album."
1,Don't even consider it.,"For a long time, many people have had the idea that what is termed ""improvisation"" in the music business is really just as much of a hoax as ""avant-garde"" is, and they're right. An early recording such as this one proves that it's been that way for quite a while. ""Improvisation,"" in case you didn't know, is the making up of music in the studio or live on the spot! The ENTIRE CD consists of this ""improvisation!"" I guess this ""music"" doesn't require any sort of thought put into it. It doesn't matter what the end result is, because music requires composition, and ""improvisation"" is not composition. Thus, this is not jazz, and it certainly isn't music--regardless of what so-called ""experts"" might say."
5,The greatest jazz-album I've heard in my lifetime,"I'm a 16-year old hip-hop head who's just begun to love jazz. Everytime I listen to John Coltrane's music I feel inspiration. When I get home from a long day at school I put ""Blue Train"" in my CD-player. Listening to it clears my mind. John Coltrane truly was one of the greatest musicians of all-time, and ""Blue Train"" truly deserves the title ""classic"". Jazz is not very popular among young people today, but everyone who says that jazz sucks should do like me and listen to this masterpiece. It surely will change their opinion on this wonderful genre."
3,Vale pelo preo,"O CD veio bem arranhado, a capa aceit√°vel. Mas pelo preo de $ 0;01 valeu a aquisio. Pensei que iria vim em melhor estado."
4,Very Well Made,"I like the box. It's very well made. It's made of cedar and smells like it which is important to protect your ties.I'm not sure that this is a practical way to store ties though. The box has two dividers which gives you three rows to store your ties in. The claim is that you can store up to 12 ties in the box which is about right. The problem is that you have to roll up each tie (if they are normally sized ties) tight in order to get four in each row. Now, once you get the four ties in the row if you take one out it's highly likely that your going to have to fiddle with the other three when you go to put the tie back in.I think something with an individual slot for each tie would work much better."
5,Just what I needed,"Smells great, Serves its purpose, Neat, Organized, Simplistic. Nothing really else to say about it. It is just a good Tie Box."
4,pretty good,"Pretty good tie storage, the other reviewers are right though, 4 ties per slot is pushing it. If your ties are thick or long (mine are both) you're really only going to get 3 per slot so 9 total. Still, it's well made and smells really nice. I just ordered a second one so I'll be covered for a while."
4,Studies in Eastern Asia Minor,"Having an understanding of the cities in Eastern Asia Minor during the first century of the Christian church is definitely helped by reading Ramsay's book. He discusses the culture, religion and geography of the cities that Paul visited during the first missionary journey. Recommended for anyone needing a better understanding of Eastern Asia Minor during the first century of the Apostles."
3,The track listing on amazon here is WRONG,There are only FIVE tracks on this CD.1. Strangest Things (Radio Edit)2. Strangest Things (Freeform reform dub)3. Strangest Things (Grand National Remix)4. Strangest Things (M.A.N.D.Y. Mix)5. Strangest Things (video)
5,Great period for Ammons,"Mercury sides featuring the great Ike Perkins on guitar as well as son Gene Ammons (Age 22)on 4 1947 dates. Great swinging sides for anyone who digs good piano based R&B and boogie woogie. All these sides and earlier Mercury Sessions as well as Blue Note recordings from 1939 can be found on the cheaper, and wonderful double Acrobat CD ""King Of Boogie Woogie"" The French Classics prices have gotten ridiculous... this stuff can be found elswhere."
4,What happened?,"A friend of mine said it best... Caution would be a triumph for any other band, but its not the Hot Water Music that everyone knows. They completely changed their sound, and personally, I don't like it as much. No breakdowns, no dueling vocals, no fun. This sounds very much like A Flight and Crash, but is better. I like it a lot, I just pretend its someone else."
1,THis is not Hot Water Music,"definitely the worst Hot Water Music ever. After Forever and Counting they lost all the energy they had in their earlier CDs. I dont understand what happened to them. Maybe they didn't like being labeled as an emo band and they decided to go punk rock. I don't know if anyone noticed but they never slow it down anymore, every song is the same exact speed and the bassist and drummer do not get to show off their skills like they used to. I am so dissapointed, things have gone down ever since they signed with Epitaph and I probably will not buy their next album. Ht Water Music was my favirote band and they still have an impact on my tastes in music...but that is why this album dissapoints me so much."
1,pure trash,i bet they didnt even write any of this album. brett probably wrote it for them. screw you epitaph!
3,Not Great,"I bought this based on a recommendation from Norah Jones but, aside from track 1, it just doesn't do it for me. It isn't that it is a bad album - it doesn't cause any pain when listening to it - it is just that it isn't strong from start to finish. Buy track 1 as a download and skip the rest."
3,"Nice visor, but not as pictured!","Be warned... this item looks nothing like the picture. It is a Phillies visor and it is nice. But the one sent is a crisp, brand new style visor rather than the distressed look pictured here. It is New Era brand and even called ""dugout visor"" on the label. It is red and has the logo on the front (and the name on the velcro strap). But it is not distressed and the red is more a bright red, like the Phillies jerseys. Also the front is a bit taller/higher and more firm than in the picture, so it sits more like a Titleist golf visor than a casual cloth visor. Not sure if any of this makes sense, but was worth passing along in case others were going to buy."
4,Enjoyable addition to the Vlad series.,"As I re-read the Brust books I still get excited and have trouble putting them down. Taltos is no different. We learn, in this book, of how Vlad meets some of the main characters in the series and we journey with him to the paths of the dead. This book is attention grabbing and I still am enthralled the third time that I read it."
5,4.5 stars,"Fourth in the series. It's an odd series--it's all out of chronological order. In fact, this one, if I'm not mistaken, takes place before any of the previous books in the series. Yet, if I'd read it before the others, I probably wouldn't have liked it.As it is, I liked it a little less, because the rapid bouncing back and forth between 3 timelines kept me from really getting involved in any of the stories. Still, since I'd already met Vlad and the other characters, I did find it interesting to find out how he met and hired his right-hand man, Kragar; how he met Morrolan and Aliera and Sethra Lavode; and what really happened in the Paths of the Dead."
4,Vlad Taltos's Early Mistakes.,"Steven Brust appears to be a man with an addiction to bad one-liners and a whimsical sense of humour. This book contains plenty of both. I've always enjoyed stories with chapter titles or smaller tales to begin each chapter with, and this book surprised and delighted me by catering to that small pleasure. The characters are almost always easy enough to like and understand and the authors style gives them a slightly mad but sincere quality. Vlad Taltos's business difficulties are always amusing, often touching and well worth reading about."
3,Great History Poor Sound Quality,"The material is superb, but the audio quality is muddy and scratchy--like an overplayed LP or a slightly off-frequency FM station. If you are looking for a historical record of superb music and inspired playing by legends of the organ, this is your CD.If you are a critical listener concerned with the quality of the sound stage and the image of each instrument, this CD will sorely disappoint you."
5,Good Accessible Closet Storage Add-On,"We installed an Easy Track closet system in our Master closet. In the towers, we wanted the flexibility of shelves and drawers. In addition to solid drawers, we installed several of these baskets as well. They install easily and hold quite a bit as long as it's not ridiculously heavy. The spaces between the wires are a little larger than I'd like and you won't be able to put small things in this basket but that's what the solid drawers are for!"
5,really makes you think,"YOUR SINS AND MINE by Taylor Caldwell is a Y2K in a nutshell. It is a small, but powerful book that causes you to examine your spiritual life. Not exactly biblical in content, but along those lines. This book is a little bit more generous than the bible in that humanity is given a second chance. This book cannot be put down once you open it. It is a novel about a farmer and his family and what happens to the earth once God has had enough of our brutality and hatred of one another. Written almost a half decade ago, it is very prophetic and timely. Excellent. Must read."
4,prophetic,"Whether you agree with Freud's psychoanalytical theories or not, there is no dispute over his intelligence, insight, and his eloquence. In this short book, he explains the conflicts civilization process created in individual psyche. Basically, he argues that the civilization's aim in uniting community in order to avoid sources of suffering imposes restrictions on individual liberty (of origin is libido--pleasure principle) which becomes the main source of discontents. He also warns about the danger of a powerful group with control over the force of nature which can potentially eliminate some human beings, which is rather prophetic considering the Nazi's presenct in Europe shortly after publication of this book. His logic is very tight according his main theories (structural theory, mainly), and writing is precise and eloquent. Just Brilliant."
4,To Synthesize Duality,"A good book though a little wordy at times. Follows a train of thought from time to time just to illustrate that it's a dead end. Does it a lot to be honest.The struggle to transform the inner primate into the higher being and all the twists and turns that lead men astray. To supress, to deny, to self-loathe, the fear of acceptance. ""Civilization and Its Discontents"" discusses the very dilemna of humanity's persistent emptiness and seemingly futile attempts to become an ""enlightened"" race and proposes the idea that the answer may very well lie in a simplistic new perception of where we come from and where we are going.A satisfying read that I would recommend to anyone intrusted in the study of psychology/sociology and the dynamic evolution of consciousness."
4,"Hey! Lighten up, it's a B movie and it's fun to watch.","OK, so it's not perfect, but it is entertaining. And, Hugh Herbert is not ""some 5th rate comedian"" he's a hoot! The overall appearance, photography, lighting, setting are all worth a look. To me, it's a campy take on the classic Hollywood ""who dunit."" There's shadows, lightening & thunder, cats, scheming relatives all in glorious black & white. The cast is delightful and includes a very young Alan Ladd. I recommend it!"
4,Don't Expect a Masterpiece!,Keep your expectations low and simply enjoy the comedy and atmosphere. This is pure entertainment not art!!! Great Halloween fun for the entire family and the kids will learn some new words for the SAT!
3,Second album from UK pop princess Louise.,"Contains the Top 10 UK singles ""Arms around the world"" and the disco-ish ""Lets go round again"". Not a bad album, but certainly not the best from someone capable of so much more. Listening to this, one has to wonder what would have happened had she the nerve of Kylie or Madonna? To stay on top certainly requires a level of talent, but a great deal more of nerve..."
2,Unhappy New Pool Owner,"To make a long story short, my pool had a leak in it at the seams. Therefore, we haven't even enjoyed 1 day in it, and I have planned a birthday party for my son 7 days away. Right now I am not a happy camper. Why? I spent over $100 leveling the ground, I have 5,582 gallons of water used, and I have a manufacturing leak. A leak that wasn't my fault. So I have to go back to the store and buy another one, level the ground at the new spot, transfer the water, then take the defeated one back for a return. Hopefully I will be a happy camper once I finish and I will be back to update my review rating. Think of me in this Texas heat while enjoying yours. (lol)"
5,Pump too Small.,"We had great fun with this pool the first month. After a few weeks of swimming, the water got so green we couldn't swim in it. I don't think the pump is large enough for this size pool. This pool was given to me. I would be terribly upset if I had paid alot of money for this pool and got only a months use out of it. If it is not the pump, then it is the type of vacuum they supplied with it."
5,easy to set up,"After taking a little less than 2 days to make sure the location for the pool was level (we used sand) the pool went up in 45 minutes. I didn't believe the instructions when they said that the pool would go up in 30 minutes, but it really was fast and easy.I rated the durability 4 stars because I've only had the pool fully operational for 2 days. It seems very stable and durable now, but I really won't know until the end of summer. For the price I'll be happy if we get one good year out of it. Two years and I'll be ecstatic! The frame is VERY stable. I've already seen the kids leaning and pulling on it and it doesn't move.The kids are having fun and it is well worth the time to set up and the money."
3,OK for Kids,"I don't know what movie the other reviewer was watching but it definitely wasn't the movie I just watched!This movie doesn't have any kind of igloo in it nor a dancing farting cow.It's about a group of teens who help save their friend from psycho who wants to rule the world with mind controlling video games, they succeed and ruin the guy (with alot of action in between). The actors were slightly fake and wooden except the girl who played Valerie (the one they are trying to rescue). It has a few funny moments and not too scary action, So it's safe for kids to watch alone and enjoy without worry from parents. This movie is also known as Spy High."
5,"Oh my golly gosh, this is lovely!","The main reason I bought this record was because I love Radiohead. And I also knew that the younger York brother was the singer, and when a York is singing it goes straight into your heart.This album is one of the best in my collection [3000records]. The best thing about this album are York's lyrics and the melancoly feeling that I just love. Another thing I noticed was that it is rather Romantic.......perfect to fall in live with.The best are (by my opinion): Solved, Stone and Settle down........you just got to love thisone!"
3,believe it,This album is best for those who enjoy the solemn thing... Good luck & listen on those rainy days alone!:0
3,CAUTION: Listen to song samples before buying,"If you're comparing this album to any of Radiohead's, don't expect to get half as much of the 5-person genius that results. Some people will like this CD and Radiohead. The sound just doesn't appeal to me."
5,A Fun Compilation! My best Christmas music pick.,"This rocking CD is a must have for all Alternative Music fans. The Supertones put the ""JOY"" back into ""Joy To the World"" with their ska version of this classic tune. Some notable new tunes are a grunge sounding ""Evergreen"" by Switchfoot and 80's influenced ""Asia Minor"" by Fold Zandura both of which are very good.Two skips are ""Heaven's Got A Baby"" by Sarah Masen and ""Holly Jolly Christmas"" by Bon Voyage. These two just don't match the feel of the rest of the CD. However, they are no reason to pass up the whole.They saved the best for last with ""Saviour of the Fools"" by Puller. So sad to see this band break up, because this song is incredible! Soulful lyrics mix with driving guitar lines to produce an unforgettable song.I highly recommend!"
3,A tale told thru the confusion of a junkie's mind.,"I've heard a lot about this book so I had to read it. One thing I found out is to throw any concepts about this book having a beginning a middle and a end. This is just crude ramblings of a addict, I'm not saying that the book is complete garbage because if you take it for what it's worth then you might get half of the way through this book before you get so bored and confused that you finally give up on reading it. This is more or less like a Fellini movie, you don't get a solid story but you get a expressive work instead. The only problem is that it is very repetitive and gets stuck on grotesque imagery that is sort of shocking at first but then gets stupid after awhile. I could see how this was considered obscene back in the late 50's but it's not as startling now."
3,A Singularly Unpleasant Book,"An acquaintance once explained to me that he envisioned hell as a complete separation from God and therefore from all forms of love and goodness. _Naked Lunch_, by William S. Burroughs, explores the delusions of a drug addict trapped in such a hell. There is no plot that I could detect and no character development - in fact there are barely any characters at all. There are, instead, a series of nightmarish episodes involving torture and psychological manipulation, science devoid of morality, sinister conspiracies, sexual perversions, murder, degradation, and excretory functions.At the time of its publication, _Naked Lunch_ was unprecedented and it had great political, social, and literary significance: according to a note by the editors, a 1966 ruling that the book was not obscene in the legal sense ""marked the end of overt literary censorship in the United States."" Notwithstanding its significance, I found no pleasure in its pages and I doubt that many readers will."
5,hell drugs and more,"I find myself rereading this book, sometimes just as I finish the last chapter. With each read, I pick up more beautiful language that makes me love this books more. Disturbing at parts, it makes for a graphic nightmare but expressed with such beautiful writing the book becomes a must read. Highly recommended."
1,Lucky to get 1 star,Shocking book. Unreadable. Hated it! What more can I say. Don't buy it.I cannot understand how this book is a classic.
3,Not Burroughs' best,"Although NL has been acclaimed as genius, WSB himself didn't think it was successful. Those of you who are turned off by the contrived shocking imagery of NL and won't read another WSB novel: Please reconsider and read some of his later, more ""mature"" post-60's novels; Wild Boys, Exterminator! (short stories) Cities of the Red Night, Western Lands, etc.Those are the books where Burroughs' 'voice' comes through, and makes his earlier writings (NL, Nova Express) seem almost childish."
2,Not Impressed.,"I wanted to read this book because so many people told me it was a great book, and it had been banned, so I knew it must be good.I have now talked to many people who do not think it is a masterpiece or anything even close. It is different from most books I have ever read, but the stories themselves did not flow well, especially not together as one. It was not memorable for me. I won't be re-reading this one."
1,"Piss off, you mo fo Bill Burroughs","This is probably the worst thing i have ever read. it is just aa jumble of nonsence words from a junky bastard. i love the Beat Generation, but come on Bill!!! This is not a novel. It sounds like a really long, incoherent, and boring poem. nothing makes any sence!!! This book puts to shame what i have said in the past is my favorite era of literature. F@#$ YOU, BILL BURROUGHS!!! I've heard good things about ""Junky"" though. i might read that one."
1,Terrible communcation.,The seller did not communicate with me that the book I ordered was never sent. He only informed me after I contacted them a month after the purchase the book was not available and that they would give me a refund.
5,one of Adidas best,I love the Stan Smith. i dont think anybody actually still uses them for tennis. its more of a casual shoe now. my all time favorite shoe in the Adidas Superstar aka shelltoe but the Stan Smiths come close second. make sure you keep them clean or by a new pair every 3 or 4 months. nothing worse that a pair of dirty Adidas.
1,Not a Stan Smith,I bought the shoe and they are ok but they are NOT Stan Smiths. Just a bland old no name shoe.
4,Almost the same...just too small. Order up a 1/2 size???,"My hubbie has been wearing Stan Smiths for a looooong time. For a while they were difficult to find. We were delighted to find them on Amazon. HOWEVER, they are not true to size. I have to return them & reorder a larger size. (Return shipping is on me, apparently.) I saw this same comment from someone else. We even held the shoe up to his old Stan Smiths to compare the length of the 2 shoes- the new one is obviously shorter. Hoping an 11 1/2 will fit like the old 11!"
1,Lackluster Performance,"If you like Black Uhuru, you will be disappointed by this lackluster performance and minimalist musical arrangements."
3,Very basic,"Wonderful pictures! I was hoping for more information on selecting a puppy and pro & cons on using the internet to find a breeder. Mainly a basic ""puppy care"" book. A 10 minute read with some useful information."
2,BEAUTIFUL PICTURES,IF YOU WANT TO LOOK AT PICTURES WITH LITTLE USEFUL INFO THIS IS YOURE BOOK . MORE LIKE A PITCH BOOK FOR THE BREED .
3,Not So Hot,"This is a decent entry level book but nothing more. I was hoping for a bit more info on puppies and discovered this book lightly glosses over each topic covered, however, I give it three stars for some nice pictures."
5,swapping your love for hate,"this cd kicks , i dont know why everyone cant get over the girl leaving , i think its the best thing to happen to them. On to the album, now the ORIGINAL writer of the songs can sing them the way they were meant to. The only track that doesnt do it for me is ""Sick"" While the most amazing track is Loretta Young Silks. This song scared me , i thought it was talking about me, especially with the lyrics like ""swapping your love for hate"" If you dont know Sneaker Pimps, Please try SPLINTER first , then BECOMING X, then BLOODSPORT to give you a better understanding of where it all fits"
2,CONFUSED... and HIGHLY dissappointed,"I was a huge fan of the sneaker pimps first album ""Becoming X"", and was looking foward to listening to this album. But I was noticing that the female vocals were missing (Kelli). It also sounded diiferent from ""Becoming X"". Therefore I thought it was another group. Now only until now, after reading the reviews I know what happened. The british guy's voice is very annoying and misplaced. They have swayed away from trip hop. There are only a couple of songs that are good, a couple that are ok, the rest not good. Don't waste your money on this album if you really enjoyed Kelli's vocals. They are in no shape or form in the same league as Massive Attack or Portishead or Radiohead."
1,sucks,The guy singer sucks and Kelli is way too talented for them anyways; she belongs solo. You can't replace a girl singer w/ a guy and keep fans!
3,Not Working For Me,"This just isn't the Sneaker Pimps sound - unlike Becoming X - that was awesome. I found a few tracks okay, but I won't be purchasing this CD because it only lets me down. It just doesn't work for me. I do hope they come out with another CD and familiar sound as the CD Becoming X - until then,,,I'll stick with my old sneaker pimps CD."
1,Yuk!!,"Major let down! I was thinking this album would be more like becomming X and it nothing like it. What's with the guy singing, he sounds awful. This album is a waste of money and is heading for the TRASH!"
4,boy-band trip-pop,"It gets a ""4/5"" because I don't think the lyrics are as profound in their off-kilter view of gender politics as those on their freshman issue, ""Becoming X.""But then again, The Sneaker Pimps have become an all-boy band, never so obvious as in the realization that it's a GUY singing on the song ""Bloodsport."" He tries to sound as much like a girl as possible, but it just points up how sorely the songs miss female phrasing!HAVING SAID THAT, the guys have forged ahead to create a couple of trip-pop beauties: the titular marvel, ""Sick,"" ""Kiro TV"" and ""Small Town Witch."" They are similar in feel to Nine Inch Nails on ""The Fuel"" which seamlessly incorporates symphonic samples from the 1990 ""Gorky Park"" film soundtrack written by James Horner (""Enemy At The Gates,"" ""Sneakers,"" ""Aliens,"" and ""Once Around""). On """"Becoming X"" their composer of choice was the brilliant John ""Born Free"" Barry.It takes a few listens, but this album's groove eventually sinks in and takes hold!"
1,bloodsport?,"Bloodless is more like it. What a [disapointing] cd--absolutely no [substance], one semi-memorable tune getting airplay, the rest is bland and throwaway. I detect a sample of Nightclubbing on track 3 or 4, wasted on a tune that does no justice to the original. I must not buy a cd based on one radio hit...I must not buy a cd based on one radio hit...I must not buy a cd based on one radio hit...I must not buy a cd based on one radio hit..."
2,Let Down,Not a gem in the mix. Becoming X stays on top. Spin spin suggar great. This ones dull. Bring back the original female singer.
3,Disappointed......,"After quite a few years of waiting and anticipating a few release by Sneaker Pimps, I felt let down by their `Bloodsport'.Maybe its because I was `blown-away' by `Becoming X', such a fantastic recording that it was with the captivating and sultry vocals of Kelli Dayton. I was very much hoping that she would also be on this cd. I have listened to this latest cd, the vocals are good...I like it alright....but it is such a very different sound than the last one. It's almost like another Garbage cd without Shirley Manson.... even though the rest of the band is talented, what would it be like without her?"
3,"great collection of short clips, turn off the volume","If you have never seen any vintage clips, this is a great collection. classic moves, and clear depiction of styles. But the soundtrack!The solo piano presents such an utterly superficial (bordering on ignorant) impression of what the actual soundtracks might have been (swing, latin, etc.), that is better to just turn off the volume, it is that annoying. Obviously a big job for a pianist, but in this case, way too big a job for the talent available. If you are going to overdub a soundtrack, and charge your retail price, show some knowledge of the period musical styles!"
3,Enjoyable expos√©,There are a lot of interesting authentic clips on this DVD. I consider this to be a must have for anyone who is lost in early 20th century social dancing. I have not seen most of these before. But the off beat piano track is a shame.
2,PLAYING FREE CELL,"HAVING PLAYED FREE CELL ON MY P.C. FOR YEARS I WAS THRILLED TO SEE A HAND HELD VERSION OF THE GAME ON THE MARKET. I IMMEDIATELY PURCHASED THE GAME AND UPON DELIVERY CAREFULLY READ THE INSTRUCTIONS IN CASE THE BASIC RULES VARIED FROM THE ONE I WAS ACCUSTOMED TOO. I TURNED THE GAME ON AND IT MADE ALL KINDS OF NEAT SOUNDS BUT I QUICKLY BECAME CONFUSED AND FRUSTRATED. DUE TO THE DESIGN OF THE PLAYING AREA I COULDN'T READ THE CARDS THAT WERE STACKED UP BECAUSE THEY WERE SO SMALL. THE SCROLL DOWN BUTTON DID NOTHING BUT CONFUSE ME EVEN MORE. THE FRONT CARD WAS BIG AND BOLD BUT EVEN WITH MY GLASSES ON, IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE WHICH CARDS WERE STACKED ON TOP OF THE FRONT CARDS.I CONSIDER THIS GAME A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT AND WASTE OF MONEY. MUST HAVE EXTREMELY GOOD VISION AND MUCH PATIENCE TO ENJOY THIS GAME."
1,"Can't see, broke first day","You can't see the cards in the screen. Color does not mean red and black for the suit. It just has color effects. No help to determine suit. Roll up button takes you directly to the top row only. Still can't see the cards in between. After just few minutes the display was too dim to read. Turned it on/off, new batteries; nothing helped. Sent it back. I also have the Radica Free Cell. It is superior; just wish it was in red and black."
1,Save your money!,"This game is a big waste of money. It is nearly impossible to see the screen. If you like freecell, there are other handheld freecell games that are a lot better."
1,Screen Size,Purchased the Freecell game with so called better graphics but when playing a magnifying glass is needed to see all the colors!!! Don't buy this game unless you want to go blind.
3,You get what you pay for.,"If you want an inexpensive Freecell game that might get abused some, this is it. I bought one of these , figuring that if if didn't work, I was only out the cost of a pizza. It does work, but as the other reviews say, the cards are TINY! I am terribly nearsighted, and I often play without my eyeglasses in order to see the cards clearly. It is best to play it in the dark, as the screen isn't very bright. It takes a while to get used to the layout of the keys, but it won't let you make any illegal moves, so any wrong moves you make are on your own. The sound effects are OK, although some people don't like the card-move sound (kind of a squelching splat). My main objection is that the black card symbols show up as white. I see they did it for visibility, but it still bugs me. If you want an inexpensive Freecell game, this is it. If you want it to be easier to play, you might look at the Radica brand one, that has the row keys laid out in an arc."
1,Handheld Freecell,The game is not like the usual Freecell. When you turn it on it starts automatically and it cannot be controlled. No button will assist. In appearance there are no card images. Images are not clear. No contrast - very dull. It could not be figured out how to play because you could not control the game. The numbers just ran up to the top and finished by itself. Was looking for some way to calibrate the game but there did not seem to be any.
1,Free Cell Review,"This product is terrible! I put batteries in it and used it for 2 days about an hour each day and on the 3rd day, the screen went blank. It doesn't light up anymore! It makes lots of noises, but you can't play the game anymore. It's a waste of money and time. I would think the products you sell would hold up a little better. I'll think twice about buying any electronic games on Amazon.com again. I will also highly recommend to my friends not to purchase them through Amazon.com."
5,Spend some creating time with your children,"This book is a good crafting guide for creating projects with children. It provides step by step instructions, with illustrations for those of us who can't follow instructions (yes, dads, you might be able to do it by looking at the pictures). The book even provides pattern guides for cutting out pieces. This is a good brainstorm book for creative crafts using common household items. Highly recommended for K-5 grades. (yes, I am a certified teacher, so I would know about age appropriateness.) Ideas can be used for other holidays as well!"
5,A must for someone that can not afford to fall.,I bought these for my husband for Christmas. We had a large ice storm just after I purchased them. They work very well. While I was sliding everywhere trying to clean off the car he was walking around with no problem whatsoever. I am going to have to purchase me a pair now.
2,Average Product,"A few months ago, I ordered the shoe grips. The grips work in theory. However, the spikes are a bit noisy and a little cumbersome. I'm looking for an alternate product to use for this coming Fall/Winter."
2,They changed the formula!,"I've been using the get a grip advanced for 3 years.I found the ""original"" design to be well made and long lasting, which is saying a lot considering I walk on them for 6 hours a day on my postal route. That being said, what is pictured as the product (bi-directional tread, spike ""diamond"" pattern, heavy duty rubber) is not what is recieved these days......apparently the company has a new manufacturer. The ""new and improved model"" now has thinner rubber, no bi-directional tread, and a ""square"" pattern which I can attest does not provide as good a traction as the diamond pattern. With the original model I used to go through replacement cleats, but do not bother to get them with the new model.....the cleats will outlast the rubber....the inferior rubber heels disintegrate in no time. The only improvement was that they go on easier and stay on better.....please improve the quality!!"
2,Not what you see.,"The item you receive is NOT what is pictured here. The pair shown in the picture is the ORIGINAL design of the Get-a-grap Advanced. They have changed the design with is inferior to the ones pictured. I walk 6.5 - 7.0 hours a day as a Letter Carrier. The original design lasted more than one winter (like 1.5). The new design is junk and they barely last a month and a half. They've gone to a thinner, softer rubber that has NO DURABILITY. I'd be willing to pay a bit more for the originals, but I'd stay away from these unless you're only gonna use this ocassionally."
2,The older model was better,As another reviewer mentioned I just ordered these and they are not the same as what is pictured.These are made of a far thinner rubber than the previous model and while they go on better on regular shoes they are smaller in the front and have to be stretched a lot to fit on my boots.We will see how these hold up but I wish I could still get the old model.
3,3 stars,"I gave the book 3 stars. It's well written but not as interesting as I expected.I've read the other Lancaster character books, and while this is one of them I just didn't enjoy it as I have others."
5,The Ulysses Bible,"This large book is sort of the ""Ulysses Bible."" Vast and aggressively comprehensive in scope, it is an astonishingly complete glossing of the text. Every name, place, event, and historical figure is given a brief explanation; and all non-standard English is defined, from foreign tongues to the Anglicized Irish slang. Poems and songs -- even those only briefly mentioned in the text -- are often printed in full, and detailed maps are provided for each section. The chapter ""Oxen of the Sun"" is given a full analysis, clarifying each paragraph in terms of the author and/or style that Joyce is parodying. In addition, one of the appendices analyzes ""Aeolus"" for its full repertoire of rhetorical devices. I also find it amusing that the book points out several of Joyce's little errors. (Excuse me -- ""portals of discovery."") This is not a quick reference book for the faint of heart; but for a full study of Ulysses it is invaluable."
3,Uninteresting minutai,"I bought this to help better understand what is actually going on in the less decipherable episodes of Ulysses. This is not the right book for that: What it gives is sources/translations of many of Joyce's references, but not a ""reader's guide"" to the episode. Although for that I found Yale's online guide useful [...]"
4,"Thorough, but not best for the novice reader","Gifford's book offers fascinating glosses and contextual annotations for Ulysses, but was not quite what I was looking for to help me with my first attempt at the book. The annotations are mostly disjoint explanations of specific allusions and references.There are other guides to Ulysses that are better suited for the novice Joyce reader, helping the reader to keep track of the plot, the progress of the Odyssey and Hamlet corelations and explaining the shifts in style through the book. This kind of hand-holding may be unnecessary for more sophisticated readers, but for my first read, it was essential!"
3,Not what I was expecting,"I own the Minna Lessig Strength and Grace workout and really enjoy doing that video, so I thought I would enjoy this one too.Unfortunately, I didn't.She should be called ""Knee-na the Lunging Princess!""This whole video is lunge after lunge after lunge. The first 3 circuits (both the strength and cardio portions) are ALL lunges. If you have bad knees, or knees that get sore easily, avoid this video. I had to modify every exercise, even in the cardio portions of the circuits, which included Jumping lunges!On a good note, I did like the fifteen minute bonus weight training portion at the end of the video, which had some excellent ab work. I also liked the one circuit that focused more on punches and shoulder strengthening.I hope this was helpful!"
4,Really great workout video! But it has a few drawbacks...,"This tape is really good, I mean I worked up a major sweat and I felt the burn for hours afterward. I couldn't walk the next day I was soooo sore! But even though I am praising it, this workout does have a couple of drawbacks but not so bad to make it not worth 4 stars. Number 1 there is no one to show you how to do a lower impact or easier workout if you are a beginner. She does tell a few times how to do it slower but she doesn't show you so you don't know if you are dong it right. Also this tape is mostly jumping and bouncing so if you have weak knees dont get this tape!! This workout is not for everyone so if you can find it for rent I would suggest doing that first..also be prepared to watch it a few times because it is very fast paced and none of the movements are really well demonstrated..all in all it's a good workout and I really enjoyed it!!!"
5,It's always worked for me,"This is by far my favorite tape. It remains challenging even years after I first purchased it. Two years ago, I bought this tape since I was getting rather soft around the edges and lost 15 pounds in no time flat. This same tape got me past the dreaded freshman 15 as well (that's losing 15 pounds two times on this tape, people). It isn't particularly dancy - just classic fitness - she focuses very much on squats and lunges (so beware those with knee problems, and hello those who tend to gain weight on their behinds like me!). Included is a 15 minute bonus toning workout with some great ab work at the end. The tape will have you firmed up in no time, and somehow manages to target just about every muscle group at some point. Minna is an upbeat and capable instructing, and not in the least bit annoying to go with it. So buy, enjoy, and lose some weight: trust me, this tape works."
5,Great workout!!!,"When I first tried this workout, I was sore for two days and felt every muscle in my legs! It is a great workout and I'd say if you're a beginner, it'll be a little challenging only first couple of times, after that you'll really enjoy it !! It works legs very well, I could realy feel burn in my legs, the 15 minutes bonus at the end includes strength training with weights and abs workout. I've had better abs workouts, but this is not really a targeted abs toner anyway... Overall, I've been doing it for some time and still enjoy it, it makes me feel my arms and legs! And Minna is very insparational. Even though the music isn't wow.... myself I do not hear the music when I'm working out, I'm trying to concentrate more on what I'm doing, not listen to the music... I would highly recommend this tape."
3,Not for People Who Live in Apartments,"This video is different than any other exercise video that I own. There is no dancing. No moving to the music. Most of the aerobic moves involve doing quick movements in place or jumping. There's a lot of jumping which makes it difficult to do if you live in an apartment or anywhere where you have neighbors below you. It is definitely not a tape for beginners. You have to be in pretty good shape to do the workout. I gave it 3 stars because it is a safe workout and the instructions are clear. I was sore the next day so it definitely worked some muscles. However, I prefer more dance oriented aerobics routines so I don't find this a particularly fun tape to do."
4,FINALLY A CHALLENGE,"I was very pleased with this tape. I recently purchased Minna's Emergency Workout and that one was good but this tape really makes you work. It is not very long, only 35min or so. But the workout is very challenging. I have done all the tapes, from the firm, to Taebo Advanced to Advanced Stott Pilates,etc. I must say I have bought too many tapes and unfortunately they are not always difficult. Well this one was an excellent workout and I would definitly recommend it."
3,Different than most....,"This was my first Minna video, and I'll probably try another... She has a competent manner, and seems to enjoy what she is doing. HOWEVER, after one run through I put this video up on Marketplace to resale. Minna does A LOT of jumping, and although I modified to low impact, it seemed to slow the workout down enough to make it feel ""flat."" I also missed the use of weights during the interval training. Just a personal preference, I guess.I had to come back and edit my review! Two days following my trial run of this video, my muscles had that pleasant sensation that I had had a ""good"" workout. It was hard to tell that I was getting such a complete workout while I was doing it. Someone had already bought up my copy, but it wasn't appropriate for me anyway. Anyone with creaky, at-risk knees needs to really think hard about this purchase. Those of you who can do it, go for it!"
5,"Gettin' in shape, turbo speed!","I recommend this video, without a doubt, if you are currently in good shape in respects to endurance and lower body strength. I was initially apprehensive as to the kind of results after working out only 35 minutes. But, I am no longer! I have been doing pilates and am an avid hiker and cross country skier and am in good shape; but after doing this video, muscles that were not sore before were! I am slim too but after a month of using this video, my body has shrunk in size. Clothes just fit a little looser and I do indeed stand up straighter. I think that the tape was a mastermind in regards to keying in on an overall body conditioning and strengthening. Also, I have never had the ab results that I have gotten from the 15 minute workout. This is my primary tape now and have to remember to not do it a day before long hikes since my legs are usually pretty exhausted from the tape!"
3,Not for those in shape,This video is not for those who are in shape! The video is way too easy. I do enjoy Minna's direction and non-dancing workout but she needs to increase the intensity.
1,This woman is crazy!!,I would not purchase this video unless your body is in perfect condition! I regularly do vigorous workouts five days a week. This video is really challenging. She has you do jumping squats which could really injure anyone with weak knees. This is definitely not a good choice for beginners. I wish I would not have purchased this video.
4,Moves along nicely,"I liked this video because it moved along at a good pace but wasn't overly difficult to follow. I don't think I'll get bored with it too quickly. Plus I liked the moves. They were different enough to be challenging, not so much that I couldn't follow them the first time. I liked Minna's style also. I agree the music is nothing to rave about, and the background/production could have been improved. But these are secondary to the workout itself which I liked a lot."
4,Love this Workout,"I bought this video on VHS in 2001 after I had my first child. I was desperate to lose the weight and tone up. I found that after about 2 months of giving this exercise video a try I was in better shape than before I even got pregnant! Every exercise routine reaches a plateau, however I found that the better in shape I got, the more fun this video is. I admit I couldn't even get through the first two circuits when I first started, and woke up so sore I couldn't even walk up the stairs. A few years later, I'm still loving this video and use it as a great and fast cardio workout. I'm not a fitness expert, and I read a lot that this is beginner/intermediate, but it is a good basic video with no corny whooping and hollering. She is down to earth, but gives enough motivation in her video to keep up with the workout. Minna is awesome, and I do have a lot of her videos in my collection."
5,The Most Beautiful Ballet Of The 19th Century Recreated,"When La Sylphide first premiered on March 12, 1832, Marie Taglioni made ballet history by dancing in the first white tutu and dancing the whole performance en pointe. It is considered the first Romantic ballet (not the court dances or court-inspired dances of the time of Louix the Fourteenth). For the first time, a world of whimsy and poetic imagery was staged. La Sylphide tells the story of a Scotsman who is married but falls for a mysterious aerial creature- La Sylphide. There is much plotless dancing and beautiful forest scenery. A villain- Madge, bent on ruining the lovers. This production from 2004 is performed by the Paris Opera Ballet company. It's beautifully re-created from the original choreography by Taglioni. The music is masterfully orchestrated and the bonus feature recounting the history is a fine addition. Own this DVD today if you love classic ballet."
4,Does what it's supposed to.,"Got the cover in two days and put on my 31"" spare. Pulled it back off to adjust and the elastic cord broke. The ends of the elastic were poorly connected. Luckily, my mom knows how to sew, so we un-stitched the outer part some and I used a copper wire crimp to crimp the two ends back together, than sewed it back up. Works great. Some may say I should have returned it for being defective, but for a $9 tire cover, shipping it back would have been pointless."
3,Sags a bit in the middle but still a good read,"It's hard to give this book a higher rating since the secondary characters completly distracted me from the main characters. While they were interesting the hero/heroine were upstaged by the children and Hargate (hero's father). Basically this book is about a wealthy, young peer who is the epitome of young English blood stock, he secretly lusts after a woman who is no longer welcome in their insular society. She is hired to teach his nephew how to paint while her daughter convinces the nephew to run away to the ancestral home and search for treasure. The adults soon follow and mayhem ensues. The main problem is that you find yourself caught up in the children's travails and uninterested in the adults troubles. The end was cute and clever and not really a surprise. If you read her older books this book is not as meaty but still enjoyable."
3,not that exciting,"I was disappointed with this book. I liked Bathsheba but I thought Benedict totally dull. I couldn't stand when the author used those ""bored looks"" comments to show how clever Benedict was. The perfect man was more like a total snore. I liked the kids though and would probably read their book..."
3,Power of Cool,"I got the CD just for the one track ""The Tropical of Cool"". It's one of the great Smooth Jazz hits! The rest of the album is so-so."
4,Still Original,Another dreamy and creative Bill Laswell project. This cd will take your mind down different avenues than most music does.
4,"Ekstasis ""Wake Up and Dream""","This CD is very diffrent, very relaxing, I love it and I would give it to anyone as a gift. It's music for any body! Hope they come out with more."
1,This dictionary is a disappointment,"This dictionary is full of poor photoreproductions from earlier issues, proofreading errors, archaisms, and other difficulties. It is one big mistake. Beware the Hippocrene family."
4,cake boss,Iwas very happy with my purchase as when i ordered this product i was concerned it might not make it for Xmass but the fact i was able to track my purchase but the only concern was under the inpression i would have to sign for my purchase when it arived as i found it in my mail box.
3,Nice quality; smell wonderful; too narrow for toe area.,"These shoe trees smell wonderful, and are well made, but they are too small for the size stated. I really wanted to use them to stretch the toes of my shoes because manufacturers nowadays make shoe toe boxes too narrow, and ""shoe stretchers"" are always too narrow and pointy in the toes. These shoe trees have wider, rounder toes, and some people had said that they stretched their shoes in the toes. I should have bought a men's size for this purpose. I suppose I could wrap them with layers of Rigid Wrap or something to make them wider, but I'm disappointed in how narrow they are for the ""size women's 6.5 to 10"". If they were the correct size I'd give them a 5 star rating."
3,Account of Wahhabiyah movement and beginning of Saudi Arabia,"An excellent early nineteenth narrative report of the major Bedouin tribes of the Arabian Peninsula including insightful commentary and reflection on prevailing folkways and mores by a European Arabist.Primary focus is the early beginnings of modern Saudi Arabia, the unification of the Wahhabiyah movement and the Al Saud family, the spread of Wahhabiyah Islam, conflicts with the indigenous Bedouin tribes and Ottoman Turkish occupation.A provocative first hand account, highly readable for anyone interested in Islam, Saudi Arabia, the Ottoman Empire and the Arab world. At once an anthropological and historical work."
2,HUGE,"My husband was in need of a new lunch box to bring to work, he wanted one that was large. I ordered this one thinking it should be about the right size. This thing is massive! It could easily fit enough food for an entire picnic for a family. I returned it."
3,Lasted about 7 months before seams tore.,Bought this lunch bag 7 months ago and just noticed the bottom seam is coming apart. Not to bad for a cloth lunch bag. Probably won't buy another one though.
1,Aweful!!!,"Received a defective piece.Had it ordered for a trip ,was happy the bag is delivered in time and the bag looked good from outside However from inside it looked shabby , inside lining is torn and the insulated materiel inside does look good and strong. Is not worth the cost ."
3,It serves the purpose.,Use the bag for packing lunch for work. Am an equipment operator and searched for this kind of bag to tote. The only negative is in the zipper which seems to catch on the vinyl lining of the bag creating tares.
1,Give This One a Pass,"Easily the most disappointing CD I have purchased in years. Hard to differentiate one track from the next. They all sound as though they are based on the same bit of drum programming, and anything with the word ""programming"" in it is not really music. I played each track once, then deleted it from my system."
5,Great book for beginners,"Great book for the beginning guitarist. Like the above reviews say, within minutes you'll be playing metal. The explanations are good, the exercises better, and the play-along songs awesome. highly recommend for people starting to play guitar with an interest in hard rock and/or metal."
5,An excellent book for teachers,"I have played guitar for over 12 years. I have recently begun teaching private lessons. I try to teach such that the information I give relates personally to each student. Everyone learns differently and has different tastes.I recently purchased Troy Stetina's book, Metal Rhythm Guitar Vol. 1, for a few of my students who are interested in studying heavy metal. I have to say, this book is excellent. It starts from the very beginning, teaching how to play powerchords. Troy's notation is excellent, incorporating counting techniques into his TAB.I find as a teacher that it is essential to get your students playing something cool from the beginning. Otherwise, they lose interest. This book has been a great resource to help my heavy metal students start rocking almost from the first lesson.Excellent job Troy, keep it up.-Craig Nybo, author of [ ... ]"
5,Great book!!!,"This book and part 2 are very good for learning the basics, and also just for practice. The songs do a good job of building both picking and fretting strength, and the CD acts nicely as a metronome to develop that internal sense of time. I'd recommend these books to anybody."
3,A very brief guide to SPSS,"The title sums up the book. This is an extremely brief guide to using SPSS. There is barely a page on each topic. This book is for the person who already knows statistics and how to use SPSS. It is just a reference guide to the basic SPSS functions. Such a brief guide is not worth $36.00! If you are looking for a more detailed manual that will provide explanations of statistics concepts and on interpreting the SPSS output, I recommend SPSS 13.0 Guide to Data Analysis. It can be used a detailed SPSS manual or reference guide."
4,Country to the core,"It's perhaps unfair not to award the CD a full five stars as the vocal performances by Ricky Van Shelton are of the highest quality. Stand-out tracks include Borrowed Angel, The Best Is Yet To Come (a new song, not the Sinatra/Bennett standard) and the title track, Making Plans. There isn't a trace of watered-down pop country and Ricky's vocals are expressive and heart-felt. My only criticism is that the album is ballad-heavy and would have been stronger with the addition of two further up-beat songs at the expense of It Wouldn't Kill Me and He's Not The Man I Used To Be. I'd recommend this to any fans of real country music."
1,Not worth it!,"This DVD appears to have many options for your workout. But, I found it really annoying! She jumps from pose to pose with no preparation or flow. One minute she's standing, then they cut to lying on the ground, without any time to really get there. And, the editing is bad. You'll actually here her mess up the dialogue and say something like ""man, I can't say that word today""... it was distracting. Plus, I found her voice to be grating. Need I go on??? There are other good DVD's out there - don't waste your money on this one. I wish I hadn't."
4,Tons of Variety and Detailed Instruction,"I have to say this is one of the better fitness DVDs that I've seen in recent memory. The instructor or whomever produced the DVD actually realized that one size does not fit all and there are tons of programs to fit just about every fitness level. The practice is defintely Iyengar which is what I am familiary with, a detailed precise practice aimed at improving or workong on a particular bodypart at a time. Yoga involves patience and apparently thats what they want to get across here.The instructor also gives some tips on weight loss, so you get a little more bang for your buck. I can defintely progress with this DVD."
2,yoga complete for weight loss,"This DVD is boring unmotivating. IF you are looking for a power yoga tape this is not it. The woman seems to know about 4 postures and repeats them until you want to scream. If you prefer a more fluid yoga workout I'd recommend something else. The benifit is you do feel good after one of the workouts. If you are a beginner this might be a good start, but if you have trained in yoga before this would not be a good tape to purchase."
2,Yoga Complete for Weight Loss,"I, too, found this DVD a bit boring. The instruction for each pose took forever, even in the challenging workouts. While in-depth explanation is useful for beginner or even intermediate practices, I didn't feel it was necessary for the challenging sequence. Also, I did not feel as if there was any flow to this DVD."
3,I think I've read this one before.,"I have read three titles so far by Pilcher. Coming Home, The Shell Seekers and Under Gemini, in that order. It seems she uses the characters from book to book interchangeably giving them different names. As for character Tuppy, I don't think I've ever been as irritated at a character in a book as I was with her. It's unfortunate the old hag didn't croak in the end. What is Pilcher's fascination with aged matriarchs? All three of the books I've read have one, and amazingly the young characters are always so tolerant and loyal to these annoying relics. I paid a buck fifty for this book, I guess I got my dollar's worth."
5,A delightful story,"Covers a week in the life of Flora, one of twins, each raised by one parent when they separated. Flora is 22 and returning to London from Cornwell where she has spent the last year with her Dad and his new wife. She accidently runs into her sister, rose and they discover their story. Their Mom is married to a rich man and rose takes Flora to the luxury apt. they have in London. Emter Anthony Armstrong who was engaged to Rose. His granny is dying and wants to see Anthony and Rose. He talks Flora into posing as Rose and go with him to his home in Scotland for the weekend. Rose and her Mom vacationed there when she was 17 and she had an affair who now wants to renew the relationship. Flora falls for someone else. This is an early Pilcher novel and not as wonderful as her later ones."
2,under gemini,rather naive and boring..it is written well enough .just has not grabbed my interest at all..will sit it aside and give it a second chance later
5,Fast and Fabulous Dinner Parties,"I attended a cooking class featuring Michele Braden. I have to say, afterwards I would have bought 30 books, had she had them available! I have impressed company time after time with these wonderful recipes. Michele was the most interesting approachable chef I have ever met. I read through this book like a novel, its that good!"
4,"Great movie, bad DVD",This is one of the best and funniest Truffaut movie. Fanny Ardent is incredible. Unfortunately I was very disappointed with the fact that the subtitles are in the picture. (i.e. you can't turn them off). Buyer beware!
4,Classic Baby Knits Book. Great for making fast baby shower gifts.,"I adore this book. I really like Erika Knight's designs. She has a very modern, classic style with a slight edge which makes her designs fun to knit. A lot of reviewers have said her books are full of mistakes, but I didn't find any when I made the rolled edge cap and booties as a gift. I did have to decipher a few phrases, but it shouldn't be a problem for most knitters. The simple designs are all knit in stockinette or garter stitch, and some have embroidery or lacy edging. I would love using the luxury yarns suggested in the patterns for a baby of my own, but for gifts, I use other baby yarns which substitute nicely without costing a lot. Using white silk yarn isn't very practical either unless you are making the items for special occasions."
5,Excellent!,"This book has it all, for the inexperienced and the experienced knitter. The styles are simple yet elegant. Great for knitting for little ones who grow so fast. Need a baby gift? This is the book to use. I have made several items from this book thus far and have enjoyed every one of them. The instructions are very clear for knitters who are otherwise challenged by other knitting patterns."
1,WHAT A WASTE OF TIME!! WRONG INSTRUCTIONS,"I'm extremely disappointed in this book. What a waste of money and TIME!! The instructions are NOT CLEAR AT ALL and sometimes are even WRONG.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY AND TIME, please please please get another book."
2,Glad it's not just me.,"The beautiful photographs in this book caught my eye while I was in the library. What could go wrong with a baby blanket, I thought. I'm not sure how an earlier reader finished the personalized baby blanket without problems, but I've only just finished my first ball of yarn and I can see ""trouble."" I have no idea how the author believes that only six balls of 50g yarn will complete a 29"" x 36"" blanket. I can tell I will need at least nine balls of yarn to finish this project. I am using the exact same yarn as recommended (Rowan All Seasons Cotton, which is truly lovely yarn to work with), and my gauge is dead-on, too. I thought I was doing something utterly wrong until I read some of the reviews here. I can understand a [tight] knitter always using an extra ball of yarn, but for an author to publish a pattern that is off by 50% is just plain irresponsible."
3,Wrong sizes,"The designs in this book look great, but two of the sweaters I knitted according to the instructions and gauge were premie sized, not newborn. I'm too ""scared"" to use it again, and waste my time knitting something that will be used as dolls clothes."
3,Too much filler,"Pretty pictures and cute babies, but lots of pics of the same item. Most items have little practicality and would be better classified as keepsakes. Nice to have, but glad I didn't pay full price."
4,Beautiful Book,"This book is full of classic, traditional baby knits. I love the soft colors and old-fashioned designs. I agree with the reviewer who said she would never knit in cashmere for a baby (I don't even do that for myself!), but I was able to substitute less expensive and washable yarn.Some people have commented that the patterns were confusing; I didn't have difficulty but I am an experianced knitter. If you are a beginner, I would have a book with the basics on hand as a reference."
2,Be cautious,"Despite the warnings from other reviewers, I purchased this book. After reading through it and deciding that the pattern for the Monogrammed blanket seemed reasonable, I ordered the yarn from my favorite yarn on-line yarn store. My gauge swatch was right on, and I set to work. I've finished my first ball of yarn and have realized there is NO way the specified yarn -- 6 balls of 50gm (98 yards) -- will be enough. I suppose I should have considered that the last sweater I finished used the same amount of yarn, and it was a cardigan shrug -- not nearly a 36x29in blanket.As others have said, the pictures are beautiful and the finished garments lovely. However I wish the directions lead to those same things."
3,confusing instructions,"I've only tried one of the patterns in this book, but I agree with other reviewers who said that the instructions are very confusing. I am experienced enough that I was able to look at the pictures and figure the pattern out, but someone who isn't comfortable adapting patterns might be very frustrated.On the other hand, the book is beautiful and I will try other patterns, keeping in mind that I might need to make adjustments."
3,Some cute projects...,"Some of the projects are adorable, but I've only started one so far and already found a mistake! (I've only been knitting for a few months...) hopefully things will go well and i'll have cute little projects to surround my baby with, but so far i'm looking to stick to another book, my favorite..."
1,Kindle Edition Incomplete,"The Kindle edition of this book, The Complete Works of Artemus Ward (HTML edition), contains only the introduction by Melville D. Landon, not the entire collected works. Look elsewhere on Amazon for free (albeit poorly edited and formatted) collections of the writings of Artemus Ward."
3,"eh , not bad","i enjoyed the read , cost was fantastic !! and on KINDLE ! i highly recommend it for IDEAS , but it is disappointing for the HOW-TO info . STILL cost offsets that . information is well useful and seriously important . No i do not own such a greenhouse , yet .... the idear is intriguing and the author is FIRST HAND and experienced . drop some cash , read , learn .what?? liberal eco-stuff ?? nope . just good old fashioned gardening information . i have been called ANTI-environmentalist ,but more ecological thinker . my farm background mind enjoyed the read . you may as well . besides , it was so ""inexpensive"" , you cant lose ."
5,Great for what they are.,"These do the trick, and they're inexpensive enough that I can keep several around the house in every location where I may need to do close work."
4,Lord of the Flies - On the Open Sea,"The psychological and social class undercurrents of life aboard a ""Ship of the Line"" at the end of the golden age of British domination of the seas is the core of this facinating trilogy. William Golding is the Nobel winning author who is best known for his first book, Lord of the Flies. His literary plunge into the depths of the age of sail during the Napoleonic wars has the same claustophobic tension of this earlier work. Told primarily in the first person, it is a voyage of self discovery of a member of the 'lower' aristocracy as he makes the long trip from England to Australia. During his voyage he is forced to question long held social, political, and personal values. Golding's ability to chart the change of his main character's pompous and self righteous view of the world to a more open and sensitive one is the internal beauty of this trilogy. I highly recommend it."
5,Excellent,"This writer is excellent. A little difficult to read, due to ""old fashioned"" language used. A good insight to ocean travel in early days. Was an excellent ""Masterpiece Theater"" presentation on PBS! Reading the book just fills in the blanks."
2,"DOUBLE THE SUBJECT, HALVE THE VALUE","BY SKIPPING THE INTRUDING ALTERNATING CHAPTERS ON EMMA HAMILTON,I GOT A MEDIOCRE BIOGRAPHY OF NELSON. OR - SHOULD YOUDESIRE A MEDIOCRE BIO OF LADY HAMILTON, YOU COULD DOTHE REVERSE."
3,vibrates,The mirror fits the Jeep well but it is definitely not comparable to OEM product. The objects in mirror are vibrating unlike my stock mirror on the other door. For the price it will work.
2,Disappointed,"The original mirrors on my '94 Jeep Wrangler would not stay in place anymore. We had to re-adjust them every time we shut the doors. I spent some time looking for replacement mirrors and found these. I paid $86.72, with shipping, and they are no better than my old mirrors. Every time we close the doors the mirrors need re-adjusting. I have tightened the set screws so tight they won't tighten anymore. I'm going to put my old, original, mirrors back on. I don't know how these mirrors got the great reviews. I could understand if I got one defective mirror but not two. So I have to believe they are all that way. I would recommend to everybody to not buy these mirrors."
5,Man in the mirror,"Went off-road & a stone shattered my mirror. Checked around at dealerships and other off-road shops for a replacement mirror, shocked to find out how much they wanted. This mirror is exactly what I needed at a great price. Comes with everything you need to install. Great item. Thank you."
2,not good coverage,"i found this make up too thick dry and pasty,and left a grainy texture and not even coverage on my face."
1,rip-off,"A FAN OF ANTONIO CARLOS JOBIM, I BOUGHT THIS BECAUSE OF THE PUBLISHED FORMAT,DTS AND BECAUSE OF THE TITLE-RIO NIGHTS LIVE! SADLY,THIS IS A VERY POOR COPY OF WHAT WAS RELEASED BY VERVE, POLYGRAM IN VHS VERSION ENTITLED RIO REVISITED IN 1989.THE CD OF THE SAME TITLE WAS RELEASED IN 1987 BY THE SAME COMPANIES.THIS DVD VERSION WAS RELEASED 2006 BY AN UNKNOWN COMPANY! REMASTERED? RESTORED? I DOUBT!DTS? NONE!IF YOU ALREADY OWN THE VHS AND THE CD, DO NOT BUY THIS!SAVE YOUR MONEY! LET US STOP SUPPORTING THESE RIP-OFF ARTISTS!"
1,Criminal rip-off,"This DVD seems like nothing but an illegal copy of another DVD. Both the cover and the DVD itself is printed with ""Antonio Carlos Jobim & Gal Costa, Rio Nights Live"". Reading through the song selections, it contains the exact same songs as the other DVD i bought: ""Antonio Carlos Jobim, In Concert"". However, as I turned the DVD on it wasn't even Jobim at all! What showed up on the tv was a bad copy of a japanese (or asian) action movie! This is criminal and seems most of all like a case for the FBI!Whatever you do, DO NOT BUY THIS!!!"
5,I love Frost!,"David Jason rocks! I fell in love with him in Open All Hours, which I have the complete short series. I'm slowly getting all of the Frost sets collected. I have watched all of them on Netflix and love it love it love it! I love seeing David as Frost and how he adds his own sense of comedy to it. His emotions are great on this show. I love the characters he stars with as well. I wish this could have went on forever, but I'm grateful for Netflix because I would never have seen it if it wasn't for them. Yay Frost!"
5,A Touch of Frost - Season 4,"Fabulous, as always!! Love that familiar face in the demoted policeman one. Must now buy them ALL, so that I can be totally satisfied!! LOL"
3,Stopped working in 2 months,I gifted this to my niece for its design but didn't turn out to be durable as it stopped working after 2 months...
2,Poor Design,"If you are looking for a product that will give you multiple access points to your clubs and bag, this is not the product you are looking for. I purchased this product thinking that there would be access points to both the upper and lower portions of my golf bag, and that the front area would open for windshield access. This is not the case.It does install with ease and their customer service is great and timely. I had no trouble returning it."
4,Great Product!,"This cover is really durable. It has stood up to the Florida Sun and salt-sea air, outdoors for over a year. It is priced right and most importantly-it lasts, and still looks great. I just hose it off now and then, and it's ready to go. Did I mention it still looks great? I'd buy another one if this one ever wears out."
4,Pretty Good,"I think this is a great product for beginners, but I do feel that he moves a little too fast after awhile. I do recommend it for beginners, although I wish someone would come out with something that would interact with you a little more, ""game-like""."
1,Mostly Light-weight Filler,"I purchased this book at the same time as James E. House's GUN DIGHEST BOOK OF THE .22. This book suffers greatly in comparison. The information is scanty and superficial and the book gives the impression of having been stretched with artificial fillers of no nutritive value! It as though the author took a teaspoonful of information and tried to spread over an entire 'balloon loaf' (24 ounces of largely air) of 'white bread'...Won't work for a sandwich and defnitely did not work for this book! The author repeats information widely available and focuses on essentially standard American brands (with the exception of the Browning and the more-or-less custom Cooper.) Such fine names as Anschutz, CZ,Sako, and Walther are competely ignored--possibly because some of them offer greater value in accuracy for the money! This book was a great disappointment; save your money, or better yet, buy House's book!"
1,"The title and contents don't match, false title","If this book were a shot fired at a target, it would be a skidder at best. The book was more about cheerleading for the different rifle makers, than about the .22 cartridge. Lousy reading about the .22."
3,The Complete Book of the 22 Review,"Although Wayne Van Zwoll obviously knows what he is talking about and the book is very informative, I was a little disappointed. Not that it is a bad book because if I had it to do all over, I would buy it again. It's just that any 22 book I read is going to be compared to ""The Gun Digest Book of the 22 Rimfire"" by John Lachuk which to date I believe to be the cream of the crop. Approximately 80 of the 325 or so pages was spent on the History of some of the manufacturers. I would have rather seen this section trimmed considerably and the pages spent more on the weapons of these manufacturers. All in all I'm not too disappointed."
1,Inoperable product,I finally took a business trip and was excited to use this gadget. But when I tried charging my laptop while ont he plane it did not work. The inverter was rusted inside where the usb and plug connects. The light turns on telling me that it is receiving power but my laptop was not getting any. Because it had passed the refund period I was out of $35.
4,Addicting!,"I have never heard any of Rebecca St.James' albums in the past, but I picked up PRAY out of curiosity. I absolutely fell in love with her upbeat style and use of modern vocal mixing sounds. I use this album for everything from good workout music with the fast beat, to sing along to when cleaning the house, and even for personal reflection time with almighty God! Her lyrics make you think, and more importantly to listen to Him. Love it!"
3,"Pretty Good, Rebecca","Rebecca St. James is a wonderful example of a teen on fire for God. Her testimony is amazing, as well as her traveling family. The ""Pray"" album was good, but could've been better. I comend her for her her selflesness and heart for Christ, and her music is good;if I were a critic, I'd say that the songs sometimes seem a bit contrived and light, but that could just be coming from more worldly perspective. Going to one of her concerts, though was FANTASTIC!! Congrats to her."
5,Awesome!!!!!,"This is an awesome CD. I have to admit I don't listen to Christian music a lot. I was more into Backstreet Boys and N'SYNC, but I went to her concert in Des Moines last night and she was the best. I loved it and she had a really strong message. I encourage you to go to any of her concerts. I only bought this CD last night, but have listened to it a lot! Besides, her brother Joel was pretty cute. She is an awesome singer! Go and buy this CD!"
5,This is a good CD!,"HEY! I LOVED THIS CD! REBECCA IS SO TALENTED AND MY FAVORITE SONG WAS ""OK"" THIS IS A WONDERFUL CD, IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT, I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO GET IT! :) GOD BLESS!!"
3,Not the best..,"If you are looking for deep, Christian music that makes you think, this is not the cd for you. I enjoy Transform much better than this cd, and God next. Hold Me Jesus is a beautiful song and good to cry to when you are hurting inside. However, I find the lyrics to some of the other songs to be a bit shallow. I suppose it all depends on what you are looking for. I also don't enjoy her style here as much as Transform. If you are new to Rebecca's music try Transform."
2,somewhat dissapointed,"I would say this cd is okay. I'm not a huge fan of hers. I definitely think that she could've taken her skills to a more talented level. She should have taken her talent farther. I totally liked her ""God"" album better."
2,Too much repitition,"I got this c.d. as a gift and was disappointed. All of her songs sound exactly the same. After listening to it I got a headache. She needs a more pop-like sound. I suppose some people might like her kind of music, but I didn't. I would recommend groups like D.C. Talk, Plus One, and Steven Curtis Chapmin, but not R.S.J."
4,Very Good,"Pray features Rebecca's beautiful voice with very uplifting lyrics. I listened to this recently after not having played it for a couple of years. I have ended up listening to it several times since then.There are several songs on it that are very good and none that aren't enjoyable. I particularly like 'Pray' and 'Come Quickly Lord'. If you like Rebecca's music, you should definitely enjoy this. If you are not familiar with her, it is not a bad place to start."
5,One of the most incredible CDs I've ever heard,"I first heard Rebecca St. James' music about six months ago. I loved her immediately. Pray is an awesome album.Although I love every one of the songs, my favorite is probably ""Omega"". It is such a tribute to our Creator. The anointing is so powerful on this song.This is definitely an album I would recommend to anyone."
5,GREAT!,I love this cd. All the songs are wonderful. My favorite song is I'll Carry you because it talks about how you can help other people out and about how God carries us. GO REBECCA!
4,Great Christian Album!,"I've always heard of Rebecca St. James because I grew up in the church. It took me a while to actually listen to her, I listened to mary mary, kirk, jeremy camp, dc talk, but always stayed away from rebecca because of the fear of her sound to generic. But millions know her name, and she's got Gold records.Plus She's pretty big as far as contemprary christian music. After burning like a 100 cd's for my dad from a friend.I decided to listen to this CD! Wow amazing! What can I say? Pray is my favorite song on this cd, and I play it over and over again. The rest of the tracks are just as emtional and powerful as well. Rebecca St. James is truly a great artist as far as christian music goes. If your a christian music fan you should def. buy this album!"
2,Book in bad shape,I bought this book a while ago. I have to say that the condition was in worse shape than I imagined. A great book though.
2,Don't expect too much,"Snooze is a band of 10 individuals that wanted to make Cocktail music with a fine touch of vocals, flute and organ. All of this makes a jazzy CD with slight pieces of ambient or even electronica, I would definitely said that this CD would tie with some Cafe del Mar compilation (minus the upbeats songs), the music here is not intended for the Dance Floor or even to have it in a classy restaurant, this is solely for your listening pleasure, which is not bad but there are better CD's fos that same purpose. (I only liked the track 10 ""Did I give you much?"".)"
4,Good stories!,"As a retired teacher, I remember that both boys and girls enjoyed the stories written by Robert McCloskey. ""The Doughnuts"" was a special favorite. I thought I was buying a paperback but am glad it is a hardback now. Since I couldn't purchase the video of ""The Doughnuts"", I will enjoy watching the students that I teach now have their own imaginary visions of the characters and that great doughnut machine!"
5,an old favorite,"I discovered this book in my grandma's bookcase around age ten. It was my dad's old paperback and was already well worn. I devoured it and got hooked on novels. A few years ago I was elated to find a hard bound copy of Homer Price and Centerburg Tales (which was new to me). Now I am sharing the stories with my six and seven year old daughters. We all enjoy the endearing characters, entertaining and often hilarious events, and colloquial style. I grew up in the country and these books make me nostalgic for that simple life and those sweet people of my youth."
5,My mid life crisis,"Boys and girls, I read this book 35 years ago, and it is still one of my fondest memories. There used to be a cartoon of some of the stories. It was shown on Captain Kangaroo. Oh god, I'm so old!"
5,Wholesome and fun!,"My 6yo son and 4yo daughter enjoyed listening to the audio version (read by Mike Ferreri) of this book in the car. It is a collection of stand-alone stories, and the first in the series (with Aroma the pet skunk) started with a fast pace, drawing us listeners in immediately."
2,Too painful,"Some books age well, and others do not. Unfortunately, Homer Price falls in the latter category. As a kid (40+ years ago) I loved having my mother read this to me. Listening to it on CD recently with my wife and 10-year old son, we had to turn it off midway through. The old-fashioned situations and corny dialog were simply too painful to listen to. I am giving 2 stars, but only because it was once a classic. Not trying to be mean, just honest."
1,"What a waste of paper, printing this book","The author wrote such a crummy book that he had to pay to have it published. No doubt it was turned down by any publisher who saw it. A waste of money and time. Real trash.If this guy really is a lawyer, stick to law and keep away from the publishing industry.Books like this is what makes writers look so bad."
4,Crank it up!,"Do you like ""In Flames""? Do you like that Gothenburg sounding death metal? If you said YES, then this cd's for you! One of the best heavy hitting, brain crushing, growling vocal death metal cd's....PERIOD!Hey, what can I say? Buy it, put it in your car's CD player, open the windows, and crank it up as high as it can go! Blow the roof off!"
3,Grows on you,I just bought this CD and it just keeps growing on me. They are a crazy german band that try to clone the swedish sound - but they're actually really good at it. Highly recomended band - check out the nailwork CD and you can download the new EP from their site for free.
1,I was very disappointed in this book.,"I bought this book hoping to find imaginative games my puppy class students could use in addition to everyday games. Instead I was met by a book that talks about the three most common things everyone plays with their dogs--fetch, tug of war and ball games. The rest of the book deals mostly with variations of these three games along with a small section on agility. I did however like some of the ideas for builting simple obstacles out of everyday items. This is not a book I will recommend to my puppy class."
2,Disappointing,"I was quite disappointed with the book which focused on things every dog owner should know already (ie. Fetch, tug), etc. Even with the basic fetch and/or tug, there were no instructions given on how they should be done. There was only 1 trick in the book which was to teach the dog to hold a piece of cheese on his nose, then, on your command, throw it up in the air and catch it with his mouth. The instructions given to teach this trick were very simple and even if my dog could figure out what he was SUPPOSED to do with the cheese, I'm not sure he would be able to do it successfully. There are no scenarios given for what to do in case a trick fails. Unless you have no clue what to do with your dog this book is not useful."
4,Fun little book,"Indoor games, yard games and more. Very fun little booklet. Was hoping for a few newer ideas, but it gave some that I had forgotten about."
2,Not universal.,"The page claims that the mount is universal for flat-panel televisions within the size/weight range. This is not the case. The mount comes with a compatibility list, from which my 42"", 90lb television is absent. The mount was neither tall enough nor wide enough to fit. Compatibility should be listed on the page.This mount WILL NOT fit a Toshiba 42hp66, 42"" plasma television without excessive reeingineering.The mount does, however, seem well made."
3,"Kerry Ross Boren a ""historian""? Read and decide.","The Gold of Carre-Shinob is at the most very interesting reading. There are fantastic stories of long lost mines and Spanish gold in the mountains of Utah. But as far as being historically accurate, well... Boren seems to favor re-writing bits of history here and there throughout the book to support his tales. Read this book not for its historical accuracy, but rather for its intrigue and adventure."
2,Interesting Fairy Tail,"The book comes from the co-writer of a very respected, and well regarded work Footprints in the Wilderness. I think he should have stuck with that credit. The auther is incarcerated and this book feels like a fairy tail. There is some interesting info to be gleaned from both this authors books on Utah mining and history, but this one.... Major suspension of disbelief needed."
1,disappointed,"I bought this brush because i had heard great things about it, and have used benjamin moore paint for years.When it arrived i was disappointed.This brush doesn't hold paint and doesnt lay paint off for a smooth finish. I've been painting for 30 years and have used a lot of brushes and this isn't a good brush for a professional job."
3,Great color but,very UNcomfortable shoes!!! they get a lot of compliments but wearing them is a killer!!! maybe they just need to be worn out a bit to soften the leather.
2,Cute but Painful,"They are true to size, no need to go bigger. The toe narrows, so the hard plastic straps above the toe tend to dig into your feet. They are easy to walk in and are very fashionable, but not worth it. I've worn them one time, and wont wear them again."
5,Hard To Find Seasoning!,"If you're an avid Knorr user and find that many grocery stores have discontinued carrying it, Amazon is the fastest, easiest place to find it! Ships directly and costs under $3 per canister (in the 12 pack).And if you've never tried Knorr Seasoning, it's a ""fix all"" for many recipes. Particularly delicious on Poultry and Vegetables!"
5,Best spice ever,"This is one of my favorite spices. Glad to see Amazon carry it, discontinued everywhere and not sure why as it is a great item. Everyone should try it on eggs, fish and chicken, on any food really."
3,Failed to see the Magic!,"Bought 12 of them based on fellow reviewers opinions. As an all purpose seasoning so far does a fair job. I have not noticed any greatness so far in this product. I have used it in many different types of food and it is okey. I use several herbs and some spices in cooking and thought this one would be above average but like I said it is average tasting. Hope I am not missing the point here but I did expect a fantastic all around seasoning. I guess the question to ask is: What makes it so special to those reviewers that gave it so many praises? Do not regret the purchase, still have plenty of time to decide if I would buy this product again. They said it worked great with steamed vegetables but I can not endorse that. I tried it on steamed vegetables and I still needed to add a little more to the plate which defeated the idea of just using Knorr Aromat All Purpose Seasoning. I thought I would forego the Mayonnaise but it was not so. 3 to 3.5 Stars at best!"
3,Knorr,"Not the exactly same package as display but still Aromatt. I love it,I ask Knorr why they stopp selling it in Canada and they respond me abouth marketing. When you know that you can use it to make yoursself what it look like all their other products, you can find that answer a little bit naive.Many tops were unseal or open, perhaps in transport. Taste is as it suppose. Great relation with the seller, they take very care abouth the service. Thanks."
5,Aromat all purpose seasoning,"I have been using this seasoning for years and it is an excellent one. It goes well with everything from bloodymary's to soups, vegetables, meats, and poultry. It could only be better if it did not contain MSG."
1,faulty canisters arrived in open and spilled condition,"First let me say that my family really likes Aromat.But the problem here is the faulty canisters.Two of them opened before the package was delivered to me, with seasoning all over the box.I tried to complain, or ask for replacement and kept getting the 'not returnable' reply with no options to complain.So I guess I am stuck with it. Of course I cancelled my subscription for this."
5,SWISS transplants: ENJOY !!!,"How long have we waited for our beloved and aaah so missed Knorr Aromat to be available in an easy way as on Amazon ? Congrats, now we finally don't have to write E-mails to importers, beg store managers to put it on their shelves etc. GREAT ! FANTASTIC !Thank you Amazon, very, very much"
1,Product 5 - Price 1,Love the product BUT .. Bought a 12-pack in the fall from Amazon for $32 (with repeat ordering) ... Repeat ordering option was canceled in the new year and now it appears at double the cost. Given that the it takes less US currency to purchase a euro than in the fall .... something is rotten in Denmark!
4,Classic Articles,"Oxford is in the process of re-issuing these Davidson anthologies. The anthologies on truth and action do not have much new material. This anthology has some excellent previously published articles on self-knowledge/epistemology and rationality, which has become necessary reading on these respective topics.Also, look out for new stuff in Vol. 4 and 5 in this series.I also recommend Stroud's work on Davidson, which can be found in both of his recent collections (Oxford UP)."
5,beginners you need to read,I bought this book because I needed to learn to cook since I am all thumbs in the kitchen. I figured it was time to learn. Can't let someone else cook forever. My mother once told me the only time you graced the kitchen with your presence was to clean it. I did know some cooking basics but needed a refresher. This book broke things down very simply and easily. Its very easy to read and not difficult at all. This book doesn't make you feel stupid for not knowing certain things like how long to boil an egg. You won't be sorry if you get this book.
4,still on my shelf after all these years,"My mother gave this to me when I was in college, and living in an apartment.I still use the recipes in this book, 16 years later.The chicken wings recipe is pretty good!"
2,"Basically, pretty poor.","This video has a few useful aspects to help a beginner learn how to handle a bike, corner and deal with hopping logs. Sadly, most of the video is composed of chatter and watching beginners do some boring drills, poorly. It would have been beneficial to see more of the pro's and more slow motion shots of people who actually know what they are doing. Sadly, there is not enough real content to help a beginner learn to ride. Most offensively, Mary English defines the things you need to do/have if you are going to mountain bike, including stretching and the all important need for a chiropractor (ehem, given that English herself is a chiropractor, this is nothing more than a shameless plug; what a disgrace). Not a total waste of money, but amateur stuff."
4,Great place to start,I bought this for my girlfriend as she was beginning to mtn bike and we both really like it. She feels more confident now and practices the drills shown in the movie. We will be watching it again before the next season starts.
2,The Throne of the Third Heaven,"after reading his novel ""Jesus' Son"" the poetry comes as a big disappointment. abstract to the point of solipicism, emotionally numbing."
3,Good movie,I got this for my daughter - it's a different kind of movie but we love horses so we gave it a shot!
3,Life Is Beautiful- La Vita E Bella,"I highly recommend buying the Movie on DVD if you like the music. With the exception of tracks number 1-Buon Giorno Principessa and number 15-Barcarolle, from Jacques Offenbach, Tales of Hoffman."
5,It warms my heart,"The soundtrack is beautifully composed. Everytime I hear it, my heart is lifted. People who love movie scores should definitely get it!"
2,Not what I expected...,I watched the movie and loved the opera songs in it so I ordered the sound track thinking the songs would be part of it. I was dissappointed to find that none of the Opera songs were on it. The theme song was repeated several times in different versions. I like a variety of songs from a movie soundtrack and unfortunately this did not have it. Listening to the theme song over and over got a little boring after awhile.
5,for a great movie the best music,"Real emotive and ""sweet"" movie. MUST see it, must have the soundtrack...."
4,Stirs the memory of the movie,If you liked the movie as much as I did - then you'll want to have this album because from the first track you will be able to visualize many of the memorable scenes from the movie.
1,How did this make the top-20?,"There are only 2 or 3 basic melodies on this album and they just keep repeating in tracks that are just marginally different from one-another. I can only conclude that millions of people(including myself), were victims of mass propaganda. I was very disapointed in this album. If Enya's Shepard Moons is a 10 then this album is a 0.8. There are far better movie soundtracks out there, don't waste your money on this one!"
3,A skaters solo,"I picked this CD because my daughter was looking for music she could skate to. She needed something that had fast and slow parts that could be pieced together as one. I saw the previews for this film, loved the music and then bought the CD. Track 17 is haunting. It almost brought tears to my eyes."
1,It's the same song over and over and over!!,"The music is lovely, but this CD is, for the most part, different variations of the same piece over and over! The one treat is the opera piece, which is the only vocal on the CD. I loved the movie but am disappointed in this soundtrack."
5,Great book by great Rabbi,"This book is an asset to the bookshelf of both Jews and non-Jews; anyone seeking to learn or understand more about Judaism will love this book. It's more than a summary of basic Jewish belief, it is a fascinating look at main the aspects of Judaism in an enjoyable way. Rabbi Blech has a writing style that is both funny and amusing as well as informative -- this book will hold your attention and teach you something new. Even someone who knows a lot of Judaism is sure to still learn something new here."
5,"If only have one book on Judiasm, make it this one!","This book is in no form an ""Idiot's"" guide. Rabbi Benjamin Blech does an absolute brilliant job articulating some of the most difficult concepts in Jewish thought and Judaism today. Based on his book ""Understaing Judaism"" published by Jason Aronson, Blech touches on almost every aspect of Jewish life and for the right amount of time. Not too little, yet not too boring.After reading this book I realized that after years of study, I am still an ""idiot""."
5,Excellent and informative,"This book manages to explain the history and practices of Judaism in a way that can be understood by anyone. Not a dry commentary, this book provides solid information in a friendly, absorbing manner. This is one of the best resource guides on Judaism I've ever read."
2,"after reading it, im not sure if I actually understand judaism","Large book, I was expecting to get a lot of information. Having already ready a good portion of the tanach, I was hoping it would fill in the blanks to some of the things not covered in the tanach. This is not really the case. Its sort of... not to be rude ... a lot of fluff in the book. Like how many times to you need to tell me that sex is kosher? Like i get it already.Furthermore, the book kind of glosses over talk of the afterlife, and prayer, but spends extensive time talking about the Oral Law that accompanies the torah, sects of Judaism, and the sabbath. I just didnt get much from it, which was kind of disappointing. Also seemed sort of condescending if you aren't a Jew."
1,I have all albums by Hoodoo Gurus...,"...but this one is a terrible. Do you remember Adam & the Ants? If you liked it, buy this. I say, choose the other ones."
5,OH YEAH. COME ON AND OWN THE ZONE,"HELLO. DUEL MASTERS IS A GAME FUSION OF MAGIC AND YUGIOH, I LOVE IT. ITS THE NEXT BIG THING. WHEN I GOT MY STARTER I WAS SO EXITED. IT EVEN COMES WITH A BOOSTER AND A D-MAX OFFER FREE. SEND IT IN AND GET FREE DUELMASTERS LOOT"
5,A Fan's Review,"This game is really cool! I bought the Starter Set a couple of month's ago, and now I'm saving my money to buy some Booster Packs. This game is really fun and addictive, and I can't stop playing it! I log onto their site often, and browse through the cards I'm looking foward to getting soon. I really recommend this card game, so don't go out and buy Yu-Gi-Oh or some other dumb TCG, get this one! You'll be glad you did!"
5,One of the best TCGs out thier.,This starter deck helped me out alot. I have bought 1 boster and a starter deck. I pulled Metorsaur Dragon out of one of the booster pack. I run a Fire/Nature/Light deck. Great product should buy it.
5,Best CCG Ever!,"You have to get this game. It combines some of the best elements of WotC's other games and puts them into this one. There's mana from Magic:TG and the shields are sort of like the prizes in Pokemon (I haven't played in a long time so the rules might have changed). A really good thing about it is that you don't have to waste half your deck with land cards or energy like in WoTC's other games. Gameplay is fast and exciting, and even watching it will keep you glued to your seat for the relatively short time it takes to play. All in all, this is a fast-paced game that will entertain all for hours."
5,This game is going to kill YGO!!!,I bought this starter deck about three weeks ago and have bought 14 booster packs too. If u want to get into DM u should first buy the starter deck. I run a Fire/Light deck and I pulled Astrocomet Dragon out of the pack in the starter. This is a awesome product u should buy it. The best CCG yet IMO.
4,first timer,"This is my first aquarium and the skilter was recommended to me. It has Been running a month now and I havent had any issues, also it is easy to clean."
1,Worst power filter ever made.,"This plastic abortion doesn't even fit together correctly, much less filters an aquarium effectively. The skimmer does little more then makes a bunch of noise while sucking air into the impeller, and disturbing the intake of water; thus decreasing filtration.Do your fish a favor and just get an emperor biowheel filtration system."
3,same as Live at Chastain Park 1983 DVD,"this dvd is the same performance as the, Live at Chastain Park 1983 DVD same thing."
5,Some Wonderful Early Log Structures in Texas Still Survive!,Fascinating! A really excellent resource for those interested in the architecture of early Texas homes and buildings. Some examples shown in the book still survive today and it is wonderful to know their history. An important documentation of life in early Texas and an excellent addition to a library focused on Texas. Also a great resource for those interested in folk architecture throughout the country in general.
1,Sucks,"I got roped into watching this from a magazine article I read. James Mason has made many better movies. Though it was his last, by far from his best, and I am quite sure he would agree. Save your money, save your time, pic another of his great performances instead of this slow, slow movie."
4,Swansong of the British Aristocracy,"A weekend shooting party in 1913 at the estate of Sir Randolph Nettleby (James Mason in his last worthwhile role) gives a glimpse of the social and personal interactions of a generation about to be changed forever by the Great War. A wonderful cast of name (Mason, John Gielgud, Edward Fox, Gordon Jackson) and no-name (Robert Hardy, Judi Bowker, Cheryl Campbell, Dorothy Tutin) actors play together and apart with sensitivity and quiet humor. Worth watching if only for the brief scene between Mason and Gielgud - the best scene ever filmed of two men discussing the merits of pamphlet printers."
5,It's the Band,They're one of the all time best. They never took themselves too seriously and were content to make great music that makes you feel good and still sounds fresh.
5,A supererb collection of music from The Band,"I have been wanting to purchase this vault of music ever since I was aware of it's release and it was well worth the wait. I have really been enjoying listening to it since I received it as a gift from my kids for Xmas.I would advise anyone who is a fan of The Band to buy it also, because it's a must have for your collection."
4,A Question???,"Everything is great, as I'd have expected but....Because of the package design, on checking the playing surface of all 6 discs I found them badly scuffed, scored and scratched. Surly more thought could go into these things?Doesn't anyone care about the quality of the actual discs anymore??? or is it just the flashness of the packaging that matters."
4,"Great Suggestions for walks, Needs better maps","I went on a number of the suggested hikes - all were good ideas and well described in the text, also nicely sorted by area - hill range. The maps leave a bit to be desired - best to check the trip out on Google maps first, especially if you are combining routes into a single longer hike."
5,A Story that Haunts you for Life!,"I read this book in the sixth grade when I was dealing with my own family traumas. Those days, I inhaled books, but I never looked at titles or authors. This is one title I actually remembered. Later, in my adult years, I tried to find the book again and was crushed when I couldn't remember the authors name, and no one I talked to knew of the book. Finally, I've found the info for it, and can't wait to locate a copy!This is a great story of a young girl's self reliance and bravery. In the end, Til saves her own life with courage and intelligence."
1,Pedestrian Bridge Disaster,As I watched my 11 year old attempt to assemble this simple bridge I was absolutely appalled that a company would advertise this as a snap on assembly. My son recently won a local lego building competition but was completely unable (as was his father) to put this together without it falling apart at every step.Why advertise this as snap together if it needs glue? My boy is just starting his model railroad hobby and I can guarantee you we will never touch another Plasticville product again.
3,nice decoration for model,itis a nice piece but need more refinement . not worth its price . i suggest for international buyers if combos of structures should be made so that shiping can be reduced.

3,Handy for Laboratory Analysis But Not the Best Reference in Subject Area: Sedimentation,"I needed a book to help me evaluate a precipitation process developed by another engineer. Then, my plan was to update my training and operating manual accordingly. This book helped me create laboratory procedures, for that it was useful. As a book on the subject, I found it a little thin, maybe too theoretical. If you want a hardware book, go elsewhere. If you wnat a theory book with good laboratory information, this might work for you.If this review was helpful, please add your vote. Thanks."
4,Inspirational,"I only wish I would have read this book in the begenning of my language studies. It would have helped me overcome some of the barriers of learning a new language sooner. Currently I am fluent in Korean and proficient in German, Japanese, and Spaniish. After reading this book I am ready to push harder and become fluent in several languages. The story was interesting putting his life in perspective and showing how he learned. A must have for anyone interested in learning several languages."
3,doublecheck roof mount...,"I mis-measured my roof racks and these were too small for the fatter bars. I ended up purchasing the Yakima Forklift, which are 2x the cost, but work just fine."
4,I just wish it could duplex!,"It's amazing that such a simple and inexpensive printer can do such a good job. It's quiet, fast, and reliable. What more can you ask? I only wish it could duplex, but hey..."
5,Great inexpensive printer,"You just can't beat the price. Plus the fact that it has a tray for the paper is great. NEVER get a printer that is gravity fed. It never fails that eventually, the printer will develop a habit of trying to grab more than one sheet of paper. You rarely get this behavior with tray fed printers. The only downside to this printer is that you can't upgrade the memory and that it has no printer language. This is a GDI based printer where the printer driver on the desktop does all the page layout then basically shoots an image to the printer. If you have a DOS machine, this may not work for you. But for Windows based system - this prints FAST."
5,great printer at a great price!,"Wow, amazing how inexpensive a laser printer can be these days, and this is the one to get... It even has a paper tray, something the other laser printers in this price range dont have... Plus free shipping and no sales tax, WHAT A DEAL!!"
2,Brother - Never Again,"Review written for the Brother 1440 but it applies to this one as well.I purchased 2 printers for my office of 14 people. We already have a Hewlett Packard. From day one this printer has been an absolute nuisance. It takes approximately 6 minutes for any job to reach the printer, and an additional 3 minutes for multiple pages to print. Don't even bother to attempt the manual tray. You have to manually hold the paper till the printer decides to grab it, then wait another 6 minutes for it to print.Once there is a jam - which happens often, or any sort of disruption with the print job, you have to turn the printer off for a few minutes to clear the memory, and send it again. If not, the error light will continue to flash even after the problem (jam, replenish paper etc.) has been resolved. My staff members have all gone back to printing to the HP; and this, along with the other new printer, a Brother HL-1230, sit idly by.Brother - never again"
4,"Not Intelligent, Just Entertaining","What is so great about The Lost Boys is that everyone can watch this movie, whether you like horror movies or not. It is one of the most enjoyable films I have ever experienced. The charm of The Lost Boys does not come with it being a ""quality motion picture,"" but it comes with its encore of laughter, action, and likeable characters.On a scale of one to five, The Lost Boys should recieve a 2 1/2. However, since this movie is absolutely entertaining and fun, it boosts itself up to 4."
5,JOEL SHOULD HAVE MADE A LOST BOYS 2!,This has got to be one of the best vampire teen movies of the 80s. I am sure that a lot of people will agree. There is one queston on my mind - WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO JAMISON NEWLANDER? He is sooooo cute.
2,What happened to the sound ?,"I really looked forward to watch this movie on DVD. I got the region 2 disk and was very disapointed. The story is good, but the soundtrack was aweful. Is has all the elements of being rocking, but has no merit to label it Dolby Digital 5.1 since the LFE output is almost not existing and the mixing makes the sound a bit monotone instead of being great. A shame that they put this version on the market and can not recommend this to anyone."
5,Great Vampire Flick,This is a really fun movie for the Vampire lover. Scary but not to much gore. Highly recommend!
5,Great product.,"DVD was shipped very fast and arrived in the blink of an eye. Appearance was better than described, which was perfect condition and movie was unflawed. Would do business with seller again and plan to."
3,Decent vampire flick,"Definitely not one of the goriest or scariest vampire flicks, but dumb fun. Considering the amount of vampire movies that have bombed, this one isn't that bad. Keifer Sutherland makes a great vampire."
4,Poor sound quality for a Blu-ray,"Cool movie, and the picture is great, but the sound could be a lot better. You will have to turn it up ALL the way in order to understand the dialog. Expected better sound quality from a Blu-ray."
4,The Lost Boys,"`The Lost Boys' is an eighties cult classic vampire movie with the best soundtrack of any film from that era. Following Michael who is tricked into becoming a vampire and his brother who tries to save him, this film has plenty of dark humour, as well as gory scenes and a twist on traditional vampire lore. It has great performances from Jason Patric and Keifer Sutherland and Corey Haim and Corey Feldman are together again for more eighties teenage high jinx. This is one of those films that although dated in places, has stood up remarkably well and is great to watch for that blast from the past that never fails to delight. Sit back and enjoy a cult vampire movie at it's very best.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
4,"""Good Blu-ray Of 80's Horror Classic!""","Jason Patric, Kiefer Sutherland, Corey Haim and Corey Feldman starin this 1987 horror film. Two brothers and their mother move to atown full of vampires. This is one of the best vampire films andI'm glad to have it on blu-ray that has nice picture and soundplus neat extras. I recommend this good blu-ray of this 80'shorror classic."
3,Goonies Meet Twisted Sister,"This is an 80s time capsule of hairstyles, actors, and vibe and it's not bad, but it's not great either. Decent vampire make-up and familiar faces make it fun for nostalgia and it almost has a Spielberg-y kind of feeling, but I'd rent before buying. That should be enough for the curious."
3,people are strange,"Back to the 80's, with subtitles in portuguese/BR and audio Dolby True HD in english. Nice Movie."
3,meh,"It is a really good movie, but there is so much cheesey diolog(""I Didn't invite you this time, Max!"")to make this movie amazing. still good, though. Watch it."
3,I love this Movie!,"I Love this Movie, But! This Movie was not in tip top shape. The cover was poorly taken care of. Looks like it was torn and had tape on it. I wanted it for my collection. It's appearance was not collection material. So i gave it to my kids. I guess you get what you pay for. All in all the movie was in good condition. I just wished it was all in good condition."
4,No two vampires die the same !,"Filmed in my home town ... Santa Cruz ! This movie rocks.. its of course a cheesy vamp film ... but all I say to that is "" more wine please .. ! """
3,Revisiting the Old Keifer Sutherland,"Purchased Lost Boys to have another look at the old Keifer Sutherland, as I never liked him before 24. Lost Boys is not too bad as horror flicks go (not usually my bag). Jason Patric has always been a hottie. Keifer has really come into his own of late. Way to go, Sutherland!"
5,This is the greatest vampire movie ever!,"This is by far the best vampire movie I have ever seen. I looked at it for the first time when I was about 9 years old and I've watched this movie a million times since then. Great mix of action, adventure, romance, horror. This set the standard for all vampire movies behind them. None of them have been able to compare to this classic. Get this movie. ITS THE GREATEST VAMPIRE MOVIE EVER!"
3,MTV meet Vampires,I am a big fan of Joel Schumaccer (sorry about the spelling)and I had seen this film when i was nine and having it scare the hell out of me I couldn't sleep for weeks.A few years later after I became a fan of Joel's work and realized that he directed this I gave it another chance and realized that this film is SO CHESSY but I really enjoyed it. The scare factor was still there but having grown up since my last veiwing I was able to enjoy it and not be completly freaked out.Kiefer Suhterland in my opinion is the jewel of this film as David the leader of the teen vampires he gives an exceptionally creepy preformance and works well opposite of Jason Patrrick who also gives one of his best screen preformances next to Rush of course.This is definaltey cheesy eighties stuff and thats where some of my enjoyment comes from.This edition is loaded with features and a must for any horror fans DVD collection. Peace Out!!
5,"""Death by stereo!""","I watched this movie on cable so many times in the late-80's and early 90's that I could recite every line in the movie from memory (still can).Indeed, one of the best vampire movies of all time. Blood sucking, late-80's style: Corey Haim, Corey Feldman, Jason Patric, and the rest of the cast had great on screen chemistry that really came through and makes this movie a true classic.It is a dark comedy with elements of teenaged angst: The desire to fit in, a strong attraction to someone (dare we say a bit of love?).It's dated only in the sense that it reflects teen life of the late-1980's. Other than that, The Lost Boys is just one of those movies you can never tire of watching."
4,Thou Shall Not Fear,"Lost Boys... being one of my favorite movies of all time, I love the cast, the plot and even the bad clich's. With this dvd's features you can go behind the scenes it actually has footage of the cast then and now (as if you didn't know what happened to the ""Coreys"") Deleted scenes, a music video, etc. It's almost everything a fan could want. I would've loved a commentary by the cast but I guess you can't have everything. Definitely something for an 80's child or movie buff."
5,ONE OF THE BEST VAMPIRE MOVIES EVER MADE!!!!!!!!!,"The Lost Boys is a great and sexy vampire movie that is out these days!!!!!! This two disc dvd special edition is a must if you are a vampire lover like myself!!!!!! I have seen some good vampire movies,but this one takes the icing off the cake!!!!! Its about a bunch of rebellious vampires that roam the santa cruz boardwalk!!!!!! The setting is awesome and the acting is to die for and the whole movie keeps you going from beginning to the very end!!!!! This dvd also has a great theory on vampires which is very cool to learn about!!!! If you want a vampire movie that is awesome and sexy at the same time then you need The Lost Boys!!!!!!!"
4,The stuff I grew up on...,"I remember watching this when I was little and not supposed to, that of course made it even better. <smirk> The plot is classic. The music is eerie and timely. The acting - quirky. Plenty of comic relief, and good special effects. Sink your teeth into this flick!"
4,It has Bill from Bill and Ted duuuuuuude!,"You can totally tell this is an oldish film because of the 'fuzziness' of the picture (^-^) but it doesn't stop this film from being an absolute classic.This may have been scary at the time, I have no idea, but it certainly isn't anymore. Most of the violence is laughable, especially the staking of Alex Winter's character. That doesn't make it a rubbish film though.It's definitely a bit of an MTV film, even having MTV mentioned in it.Just try this film out and if you don't like it, fair enough. But at least give it a try."
4,Best Vampire MOVE!!! But dissapointing DVD,"NOTICE I give the *DVD* 4 starts the movies gets FIVE!!!The movie is a good teen flick and will is a movie to watch to give you that feel good feeling,,,,, and the soundtrack to the movie or backround music is PERFECT! it beings out the movie a lot..BUt the DVD in my opion was dissaporint the only highlightTheatical Trailers and Scene indexThe rest of it was all READING!! who would take the time read like 8 pages on a TV Screen of small parint!?!?!But atleast it is aviavible on both Widescreen and Standered... but it wouldent have hurted to add deleted screns or atleast a commintary."
5,Classic,"Has both of the corey's in another 80's film, this was way before this twilight stuff and Gerard Mcmanns cry little sister being the main anthem is a good fit for the movie, a good add to the rest of my classics."
5,The Original Teen Vampire Movie,"Right now the Twilight books and movies are a major pop culture phenomena. However, this movie was the first to have sexy teen vampires; plus it has a way better story line. I highly recommend that all teeny-boppers out there watch this movie and then decide if Twilight is still their favorite."
4,The Lost Boys Dvd,"As an adult I love this flick. I purchased it for my 8 year old son so we could watch it during the Halloween Holiday. He did not watch it but I think that it would have been ok for him. I know that the movie is rated ""R"", but I think today it would have been PG-13. There is not sexual imagery, just a little kissing, or vulgarity. There is a little blood and gore but it is very cheesy and the Frog brothers keep the mood light with funny comments."
5,Great DVD and extras!,"This was one of my favorite movies growing up, so I am thrilled that this DVD edition was released. There's a lot of great interviews and behind-the-scenes tidbits on the bonus disc. The extra with the makeup artist is particularly interesting."
3,cute,"Just as Sissy Spacek carried ""Carrie,"" Corey Haim saves ""The Lost Boys."" I enjoyed his performance as younger brother Sam, and will be watching for more of his acting talent in future productions.The boring beginning (crappy concert) would appeal to pre-teens, but once the fire-ball gets rolling, the humor is universal. The Vampire House Rules change from one movie to the next, but since I am no aficianado, the half-vampire status in this flick does not faze me; it only adds to the fun.My favorite scenes were the designer death extravaganzas of the staked bat-boys. The two Vampire-Busters (the Frog brothers) delivered satisfying portrayals of kids pushing the limits of what they can handle. They kept it real, enabling us to laugh at ourselves at that age.Although The Lost Boys is aimed at the pre-teen crowd, skillful scripting invites us moldy oldies to party along. And we do."
5,It is the (Untouchable Vampire Movie!),Out of every vampire movie i've seen this is by far the best one every made! I see these lame Vampire movies of the 90's and laugh!! Although Blade wasnt to bad. It was and still is a great movie to watch when you have a girlfriend over on a saturday night! A classic above all other classics!!! Lost Boys Rule!!!
5,"""The best movie ever made!!!!!""","Made in 1987, but is certanly much better than all the teen movies made nowadays. It was a movie ahead of it's time. Compare Lost Boys with all the similars movies like Fright Night, Interwiew with the Vampire, Near Dark. You'll notice how modern this movie was for the time it was played on the theathers, specially because of the very handsome and cool figure of BILLY WIRTH, who is certanly: THE MOST BEATIFULL ACTOR IN THE PLANET, and besides him, there is JASON PATRIC, another very good looking guy. They should have the recognition they deserves and take the place of the 'pretty' faces of Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise (they are nothing comparing with Jason and Billy). LOST BOYS FOREVER!!!!!!!!"
5,Beware The Blood Sucking Critics!!!!!!,"The Lost Boys was one of those truly great movies. Well, at leastwhen you're seven and you sneak into a theater to see it. When thismovie came out everybody was talking about it, and with good reason.The acting was superb on every level, the action sequences were bothexciting and scary, and it was just plain good Vampire entertainment.The use of kids as Van Helsing's was brilliant and made for some veryhilarious antics. Corey Feldman's character in particular was fun towatch since he played much of the comic relief. The finaltwist/surprise ending was just that to the film's target audience(people like me) and I liked it, thank you very much....If you were akid during the 1980's you probably already know what I'm talkingabout, The Lost Boys is one hell of a movie. A true Horror classic."
5,Best Steriotypical Vampire Movie,"If you are into those steriotypical vampire movies with flying violence, this movie is right for you. Even if you are totally against the steriotypicalness of it all, as I am, this is still and excellent movie!"
1,Horrendous,"I'm not one of those who criticizes other films because other people liked them, but I HATED this film. I rarely hate a film. I even liked MAD CITY. But this...this is not cinema! This is filming people and adding bad dialogue! Quite obviously a no-star movie and THE worst I have ever seen. I'm sorry if I offend those die-hard lovers of the film, but that's my opinion."
1,I'm still waiting,I am very upset because I still have not received the movie. It has never taken so long to receive any of the product that I have ordered on-line.
1,"Cheesy, tacky, and boring to the core! Yet another ridiculous vampire flick!","I finally got to see this pathetic, predictable, and utterly ridiculous film after picking up a copy in the three dollar bargain bin at a local retailer. What is it with the vampire theme that impels Hollywood to crank out mostly second rate films on the subject decade after decade, ad nauseum?! I'm sure it has something to do with the short attention span and reduced expectations of America's youth culture today (including the 80's). For some bizarre reason, vampires sell. Keifer Sutherland with fake fangs and fake blood spurting out of kitchen sinks and toilets is about as stupid and mindless as a movie can get! I want my 3 bucks and 96 minutes of my life back!"
3,Buy a new DODGE car or truck while you run for your life,"Two brothers and their mother move to the missing persons capital and while one mixes in with the local vampire population, the other becomes a believer in the supernatural. The older brother then becomes a vampire and the younger brother joins the crazy juvenile vampire hunters. And together, they try to take down the vampire gang who turned him into one. Sleek and stylish (like the video box says) but the actual terror is camouflaged behind the childish antics of Haim (who's not even on the video box!). And the drama is completely obliterated behind all given elements. All and all a half half. Funny how the lead vampire Herrmann is now doing commercials for DODGE, like the caption above reads."
3,What might have been...,"I have little tolerance for movies with a great cast and a great story to tell that don't know what to do with it. This could have been great, but instead turns into a video comic book. It's 3 stars are by virtue of the fine premise, acting and bloodletting. To see how great this film might have been track down a copy of ""Near Dark."""
3,good movie,"this movie is a pretty good movie if you like vampires. I think is could of been a little better, but its still well done."
2,Poor quality transfer,I am unhappy with the quality of the transfer. I could have done better from my vhs copy of this movie.Save your money. It was truly almost unwatchable.
5,Pages of Adventure,This book is an incredible story of an incredible lifes journey. Mr Lang transfers the adventures of a lifetime into text that all can enjoy.
1,Worst product I have ever used,"It was hard as a rock & totally unuseable. Reordered face magic which I really love, I have used it before."
2,"Math Tricks and Affiliate Marketing, not much more","I've studied higher math and was always impressed with math tricks for developing short cuts to an answer. But really in the end that's all they really are...""short cuts"". Aside from that there is no basis for understanding math in it's entirety. It will make math fun for a child (and why I've given it two stars) but this should not be a basis for actually learning the subject. I've looked into this book and a couple of others. I've concluded that there is a lot of support from other sites that are nothing more than Affiliate Marketing links. Hence the rabid reviews on Amazon which no one should really pay much attention to. Math tricks are fun but no one should learn the subject of Mathematics using methods such as these."
5,Interesting book,"This little book tells the ""unpleasant"" stories of the bible in a childrens-bible style. The drawings ar purposely drawn ugly and the font is sunday-school-ugly too. This would be a nice gift for an atheist friend or if you don't mind it being thrown away for your religious parents or ex-pastor."
1,Printing stinks!,"I was really looking forward to reading this book, but was very disappointed when I received it. It looks like it was printed in the guy's basement, and the printing is just terrible in places. In many places I could barely read it. It looks like a copy of a copy of a copy. Very poor. Hard to start reading a book like that."
4,TV Generation,"Another Classic Action Movie from the Master of Disaster Irwin Allen. Too much water has to go somewhere, even when a town is in the way! His other Classics include Fire, The Swarm (Killer Bees), The Poseidon Adventure, and TV Series Swiss Family Robinsion (1975-76)."
2,Irwin should have quit while he was ahead!,"Irwin Allen was a real showman...the P.T. Barnum of disaster movies! But after his TV success and subsequent big-screen hits like THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE and THE TOWERING INFERNO, he should have quit while he was ahead. In this boring, low budget TV movie, he brings together lots of his favorite players (Lynley, McDowall, Hershey, Milner) and gets them all wet. Strictly for fans."
3,Rehash of other DVDs,"This DVD is a mishmash of exercises drawn from other Cheeky Girls DVDs such as ""Drills! Drills! Drills!"" and ""Ballet for Bellydancers"". A menu gives you a number of different workout themes, but because the exercises are spliced together from different DVDs, many of the workouts lack continuity and don't feel very thorough.If you own a lot of other Cheeky Girls DVDs, this one will be mostly repeated content for you. If you don't, this is a great way to get a taste of their work and a source of ideas to spice up your workouts."
3,pretty pitcher,This pitcher was purchased for my mom to put above the kitchen cabinets. Its a pretty shape and brightly colored. I think for the price it could have been a few inches bigger and thats why I only gave it 3 stars. It also is quite heavy.
4,Descent book and did hold the interest of my 8 yr old enough to finishM,"My 8 yr old did finish the book, but wasn't enthralled with it like he's been with other books. Always trying to find new books that keep him interested in reading."
3,Mildly warm...,"okay, unlike patricia cabot's other books, this book lacks...hmm...passion. i had a hard time trying NOT to skip pages. I know the heroine is a liberal and all liberated, but please couldnt the author made her just a bit more arousing. the book just lacked the ""things"" that makes a book steam up, in fact the few interactions between the main characters are filled with them FIGHTING!!! It got old the third time the main character started sprouting some feminist viewpoint. Please!!!Also, what is the deal with the ""rake"". He was downright boring and well...not very good at seduction. The book just lacked any sort of passion and it was not of the same caliber as her other books.."
4,An Enjoyable Read,"This is the second Cabot book that I've read. While I enjoyed it, Pegeen at times irrated me. She was a little to self-righteous. I mean after the second time she reponse to a kiss from Edward you woudl she would get off her soap box. This is the only real criticism I have of the book. I liked Jeremy, he reminds me of my brother and nephew (probably boys in general). I also like that Edward wasn't a so greedy as to take the title of himself. It showed alot of character that Pegeen always seems to overlook. I think most romance readers would enjoy this book."
3,Don't mind me - my brain cells seem to have deteriorated,"This book is an incredibly ambitious piece of work. But I kept falling asleep during it, probably because neo-platonism doesn't quite resonate for me. The metaphysics are just a bit too elaborate for my zen-ish tastes. One of these days I'll get back to it and give it what it deserves in terms of attention, but not anytime soon. I've been doing astrology for 32 years, and generally don't shy away from the intellectually demanding bits. This one was just too rarified for me. Call me stupid, graduate degrees aside. If you get my drift..."
1,Very disappointed....,"I have nothing to review since I NEVER RECEIVED the book..... Dont buy from this vendor. I was never contacted about a delay in shipping, nor was my inquiry responded to.Ugggh!"
3,FACT or FICTION?,"Definitely an interesting read. My only question is ""how much can one believe?"" Good advice, by the way, to ALL students of history: Just because it's printed doesn't make it ""FACT"". What I did like, however, was that Payne explored a little-known ""rumor"" about Hitler's supposed 6-month stay in Liverpool (yet it brings one back to the original dilemma-- where did the author get his facts from?) Reader beware."
2,"payne gives me ""pain"" while reading book","Although this book showed the reader that Payne knew the topic of Adolf Hitler well, the reader begins to wonder where Payne acquires all of this information, for he rarely credited his sources."
2,breaks easily,"I have had 2. Both times the small bullet stops working all together. It is not from heavy use. I have found this product great if it works, but not reliable."
2,aurora,"speeds too high for me and when you slow it down it heats up too much.not what I wanted, unfortunately."
1,"Good idea, terrible quality","The idea about the ring and the bullet is good, however this product is a very low quality one, first there was a problem with the contact between the bullet cable and the battery pack, second when the small bullet is inside the special compartment in the ring it eventually gets wet, and slips out of the compartment, so the idea of reusable vibrating ring is good but this product was a complete deception."
3,Very Lacking,"I found this dictionary very lacking when used to translate Latvian cookbooks - In fact, most (90%) of the terms were not in the dictonary which I needed a translation for and I finally gave up after about 200 or so misses. I feel the basic foods / ingredients used in every day cooking are the very minimum which should be included in any dictionary. These are every day common items so don't think I am asking too much.Not very useful for translating cook books."
2,pretty bad/hard to figure out pronounciations!,"sorry, but this book has horrible pronounciation keys just to warn, it barely has any for any words, only very few, the rest are intranslatable unless you like the extra hassle of also memorising the specialty meanings for those as well, as if leaning the language isn't hard enough! its going to thrift store for advanced students or it has good english pronounciations if you are latvian needing to learn engish maybe?"
5,Very good detailed dictionary,If you are going to spend a good deal of time in Latvia and have the need or desire to have a solid detailed dictionary dealing with Latvian then this would be a very good dictionary to own. I purchased it when I was getting ready to go over to Latvia for the first of two Fulbright trips to Latvia and I found it very useful.
5,to the point with the wheel,"WOW what a wonderful tool, received it in a timely manner, priced right,was well wrapped,would buy again from this seller, thank you for the trigger"
3,Overrated Product,"This product isn't very useful and certainly NOT worth the price. In fact, when I opened the box, I expected to see ""As Seen On TV"" on the cheesy labeling.The pressure is not firm enough. Tennis or racquet balls would work better, or hard/dense plastic massage implements that are easy to locate at many stores."
2,Mildly Entertaining and Informative,"This book recalls the story of an early 1990s startup company's journey to the public market, with the climax being its Going Public Day.Because it was writen by a reporter, the book reads more like a broken-up newspaper article than a story. Each chapter is a tangent to the company's journey to IPO day. Some are more relevant than others. Furthermore, the author has a style of switching persons while telling the story, which makes for confusing reading a times.However, the book does provide good insight into detailed trials a company faces during its IPO route. If you are into IPO non-fiction it may be worth your read. If you enjoy entrepreneurial non-fiction, then I highly recommend ""Startup - A Silicon Valley Adventure Story"""
4,Not the Best (But Great),"This is not Shanklin's best collection but it is still very good...unless you thought the 90s were a political Utopia.All of these selection have a ""Holiday Theme"". Sometimes Christmas is part of the comedy and other times it is just a ""Christmas song"" used as a vehicle for the satire. In all cases, it is very creative, very conservative and very funny. Of course, funny is in the ear of the hearer.It helps if you are familiar with news items and political history. Otherwise, you might be left wonder what it was all about. Its about lampooning the left."
3,"Book in like-new condition, not brand new","The book arrived with writing on the inside cover, indicating it was originally a gift for someone. You could tell the book was not brand new, though it arrived in good condition. I thought I was buying a brand new book."
3,I LOVE THIS BAND,I used to hear this band regularly in Little Rock AR and think they are so fun. Really fabulous!!! The music is high energy and the lyrics are tongue in cheek and fun at the same time. I have never been able to forget the words to their songs and Glamour Doll puts me in such a great mood every time I hear it.I lost my original cassette and have kicked myself ever since.If you like summer party with the top down pop - get it. Whoever wrote the review above I can't imagine has ever even heard them.PLEASE COME OUT WITH ANOTHER CD OR EVEN WEB DOWNLOADS... I'm buying.
1,Disappointed,"As a firfigther who understands chain of command and the need to work with in an Incident Command System, this book perfectly explains how one FDNY Battalion Chief breaks all the rules, chosing to respond to the World Trade Center Disaster rather than remain responsible for his own Battalion, risks the lives of members of 110Truck to ""sprint"" to the 35th floor of the North Tower, ABANDONING them on the way to freelance some more in the burning tower, only to ultimately become stuck in the collapse of the North Tower where he goes on to shout at and berade a PAPD Officer who's lost his partner, a K9, to the collapse of the bulidng. This book is a shameful and embarrasing for all American firefighters, those silent heros who risk their lives daily."
2,Okay...,"I had wanted to read this book for a while, so I purchased it. Richard Picciotto is not the best writer, but he does give you a sense of what it was like to be under pressure and trying to survive the tower collapse. He doesn't pull punches as to who he blames for the loss of firefighters that day. Lack of adequate equipment, department cuts, etc. I think to a certain extent he has a valid point, but I also know that there were many other factors involved as well. Mr. Picciotto's focus is understandably on his personal experience and his emotions around what happened that day. I am glad that I read it, but I have to be honest and say it is what it is. Mr. Picciotto will probably not win a Pulitzer, but he calls it as he sees it and he was there and I wasn't."
2,Half Good/Half Bad,"I just recently read the paperback version of this book. The first half of this book is pretty interesting and heart pounding in detailing what it was like to be in the World Trade Center while it collapsed. The second half was very disatisfying. It was very self-serving and is mostly about Mr. Picciotto praising himself and his actions and criticizing absolutely everyone else. I also find it interesting that Mr. Picciotto said how hard it was for him to return to the site and that it took him a very long time do this. However, in the acknowledgment at the end of the book, he returns barely a few weeks after the collapse and with his collaborator of this book. He had already found the time to get a book deal and co-author!"
1,"American ""hero""","Read NY Daily News 26 November 2002 and weep. >In ""Last Man Down,"" Battalion Chief Richard Picciotto depicts himself as a quick-thinking boss who helped save a 59-year-old grandmother from certain death that terrible morning.But another fire chief, three firefighters and a Port Authority cop who were trapped in the rubble for four hours told the Daily News that Picciotto had nothing to do with the dramatic rescue of Josephine Harris, who said last night she never met him."
5,Outstanding Story of Heroism,"FDNY Battalion Chief Richard Picciotto's account of his survival and ultimate escape from the collaspe of the WTC North Tower on September 11 is one of the best stories to come out of that agonizing day. He was the highest-ranking firefighter to survive this collapse, and he and his comrades were trapped under the rubble of the North Tower for over four hours.I couldn't put this book down. Chief Picciotto tells his story with complete candor, and early on you realize how very lucky he and the other men and civilian woman were on that fateful day. It was one of the few miracles to come out of 9/11.It is the bravery of Chief Picciotto and the other rescue personnel, along with the civilian, that grabs the reader and never lets you go until they are all safely out of the remains of the North Tower.Do yourself a favor - buy two copies of the book - and give it to a friend. This story stays with you long after you close the final page"
3,Buried Under Words,"I don't want to take anything away from this man's accomplishments, which were heroic...but if he talks like he writes, it must have been hell to be buried in the rubble with him."
5,Firemen Are So Brave,My God this Batl.Commander was such a brave superior officer. Fire Officers no matter their rank lead their men in front ...My son a cop was at the World Trade Center when the second plane hit.He and many firemen and cops were knocked back by the blast and searing heat.They rose off the ground and back to assist....So very brave firemen and fire commanders such as this author does not startle or surprise my family ...What the Batl. Chief presents in his book does not surprise me because I know and my son certainly knows firemen and certainly Batl.Chiefs are very brave dedicated men. God bless New York's Finest.
1,"OK, there were other guys there too.","I am a paid firefighter with friends on the FDNY. First off, I am astounded that the chief managed to accomplish what he did, all by himself! Either the men he was ""leading "" were totaly incapacitated, or he has the biggest ego in the department! What were the men of Ladder 6 doing while this chief was ""saving"" them? Not being aggresive? Not being good firefighters? This chief ""saved"" the whole company! I wonder what the men from Ladder 6 have to say. I have been a firefighter for 26 years. I can tell you now that with this book, this chief just alienated himself from the rest of the brothers. I would not recomend this book to anyone, unless you are a young fire officer and want to learn what NOT to do and say about the men you lead and who does 99% of the work on a fire department."
2,Major Disappointment,"Chief Picciotto's favorite word seems to be ""I"" and his favorite topics seem to be his very high opinion of himself coupled with his disdain for higher authority at FDNY and City Hall. Taking nothing away from his personal valor on 9/11, the book was a major disappointment. If you are looking for the definitive account of what happened at the Trade Towers that tragic day skip this book and buy ""Report from Ground Zero"" by Dennis Smith."
5,Great book,I picked up this book and couldn't put it down until I had read it all. I highly recommend this book to get a firsthand perspective from someone that was there as this attack unfolded.
2,Mixed feelings,"This book could be shorter. Mr. Picciotto uses the narrative to tell us how good his is, how competent his is, but I still have to learn what happened to the last civilian that was with him and that he left behind."
2,"The Bravest, Strongest, Smartest Man In The FDNY...","...as is pointed out to the reader repeatedly and heavyhandedly throughout this coarsely written self-tribute. The Chief's courage is beyond question, but his lack of humility combined with his insensitivity makes this a tough tale to swallow. The Chief may indeed be brave, strong and smart -- but he sure ain't humble."
2,Awkward reading...,"Number one fact: Picciotto probably sensed the opportunity to make a few extra bucks from his ordeal in September 11, and seized the opportunity.Number two fact: It's strange to NOT like a book about September 1, but I did not like this book at all. Not because of the selfish and auto-congrulatory mode, but due to the literally (or lack of) characteristcis of the book. I think it's badly written, even with Mr. Paisner at the helm.As for Picciotto actions those days, only people under that kind of stresssful situation could know how they would have acted... Generally, I think he did the best he could for his city and for his companions and for the civilians he encountered.For all his detractors, I put the question: if he had died along with the shocking number of victims, even with all his ""faults"" he would have benn considered a hero, ego or no ego involved. Am I right?"
4,caught in the middle,"I am a full time firefighter/engineer in a small town with three stations. This book does a great job of telling the inside story of what happened to our country on 9-11 and also an insight to the world of firefighters, for those with no prior knowledge. My only real frustration in reading this book, is that some of the detail on this thought, or that thought, becomes a little mundane. In one passage, he dwells for a long paragraph, on a sliver of illumination from an emergency light, that some how ended up sharing the void. All in all, it is a great book, but the same story could have been told with out the hovering over so many tiny details. But then you'd have a book only three quarters the length."
3,interesting,"This is a first person account of a firefighter who was in Tower One of the World Trade Center when it collapsed on September 11, 2001. It's an interesting perspective of that day, as well as being an interesting look into the mind of a firefighter.The writing style was interesting. You could hear the voice of Richard Picciotto really well and the pacing was good. Although the forced repeating of some points (how the top brass keep cutting the budget, how in shape Picciotto is) got to be a bit much. You definately had a good idea of the main themes Picciotto was trying to get across by the end.I think I would've liked to have seen a bit more of after that day as well, but I suppose that goes into the realm of too personal."
1,I could only read 10 pages,I must admit I only read about 10 pages and didn't like what I read.I'm a firefighter (not FDNY) of 23 years and one of my colleagues knows one of the firefighters who survived in stairwell B. Apparently they think Picciotto's version of events is complete B.S. He is not well regarded so read this book knowing that.
2,Perhaps Piccioto should have hired a fact checker...,"My brother was one of the first Firefighter's killed on 9/11. Mr. Piccioto incorrectly addresses him as Lieutenant Daniel Suhr. My brother was a Firefighter who loved his job completely & swore he would never become an officer. Also, he incorrectly states that Father Judge died while giving last rites to my brother. Anyone that saw the Naudet video or read Dennis Smith's book could plainly see that Father Judge died just off the lobby of Tower One at the bottom of an escalator. It seems to me that the truth of that day was powerful enough without embellishment. God Bless the FDNY!Sincerely,James Suhr"
2,Egotistical,"I would be extremely interested to know what the FDNY thinks of this book. It was fascinating learning what I could about the tragedy, especially from inside the building, but this guy is really full of himself. Sometimes it's hard to get past his ego and get to the experience itself.My dad is a medic and I have met many firefighters and medics. I have yet to meet one that thinks so highly of him/herself. I don't know how much input this guy put into the book, but unfortunately for him - he comes off as pompous and self-righteous."
3,"Good, but not Great","Let me preface this review by saying that I am a HUGE fan of Savall's work. I collect his recordings compulsively. I have given tickets to his concert as a birthday gift, etc. etc.That said, this recording is very difficult for me to listen to for more than a few minutes. I agree with the reviewer from Madrid, Koopman's cembalo is FAR to 'wet' sounding. Furthermore, Savall's viola is FAR too murky-- even dingy sounding. The end result is a tiresome contrast.There is another recording from 2007 by Bruno Procopio/Emmanuelle Guigues which is excellent-- lively, balanced and clear. Unfortunately, for whatever reason, you can only get it as a mp3 download here on Amazon (as of 01/2009), although I am sure it's not to difficult to find a CD."
5,A Great Service and A Very Satisfied Customer !,"I recently moved from New Jersey to Florida and many of my Jazz CD's were misplaced. Seaching through Amazon's Jazz CD list I was pleasantly surprised to discover that I was able to order a replacement CD of Tito Puente's ""Golden Latin Jazz All Stars (LIve At The Village Gate). This CD is not sold in most stores in the US any longer and was a one of a kind special performance by many of the very best of Latin Jazz artists. I was fortunate enough to see all of these artists live in concert at one time or another (a few of these perfomers have since past away, Mongo, Tito, etc.). So, if you want to get the closest thing to hearing an exceptional live performance by some of the best artists Latin Jazz have, buy this CD and if you want quick and honest service in finding diffult to find CD's, use Amazon's Service."
1,Does not work,"This product is completely unreliable. I was told this by a game store before I bought, but got it anyway because it is much cheaper than the Nintendo brand memory. It is completely unreliable, just like the store said it would be. Don't buy this! Now my kid is upset, has lost all the progress he made on two games, and has to start over with a Nintendo brand memory card. Perhaps it is Nintendo's fault and not Intec's but none the less this one is a looser."
1,Do not get this!,"After 2-3 months of use, game file showed up but was corrupted and unreadable. If you do get this and you can copy your save games into multiple slots, try to save several copies, as some may still be readable after your save games corrupt."
5,Scary as hell,"This film is a total mind trip, I couldn't sleep after watching it. Pop Skull is not for the faint of heart, but for serious horror fans."
4,Romantic and rare-loved the story line!!,"I found this book in an obscure little used bookstore in lower Manhattan. Being a romantic, I was delighted to read a story geared toward everything I always believed about love."
2,Dralion,"Very disappointing. Does not come near La Nouba, Alegria, Quidam, Varekai, or even Corteo. The main problems are very poor picture quality and VERY poor lighting. Many of the sets are so dark it is impossible to see detail."
4,electrifying show/crappy filming,"I went to see this show live, and then got the DVD. Even on the screen, it was unbelievably stunning. However, in a few parts of the show, the filming was choppy, fuzzy, and unfocused on the right things. It seems like the filming crew handed a camcorder to an audience member and said, ""Hey, would ya shoot the next two acts for us? We need a coffee break."" So that detracted from those acts quite a bit. I would have given it 5 stars otherwise."
3,good video,This dvd is almost as good as in person. I saw dralion in person and loved it. The dvd gave me a closer look than I had in person.
4,Very enjoyable performance,"Enjoyed the performance but dd not see any particular advantage to the ""superbit"" format over regular DVD."
5,In a word - - WOW!,"I've never seen a Cirque du Soleil show before and was apprehensive on dropping $100+ on something I wouldn't enjoy so I caught this on pay-per-view.Wow - what an amazing show! Some of the most incredible acts I have ever seen with a wonderful asian and middle-eastern influenced soundtrack. A combination of both circus and theater with elaborate lighting, sets and costumes. Now I'm just sorry I saw it on the small screen before seeing it live.I immediately called up my dad and told him it's a must-see as they will be travelling to his area in the next month or two. I, unfortunately, missed the show when it was in my area and will have to settle for the DVD. Hmmm... it has been a while since I've seen my dad..."
1,disapointed,"My order came in a short time. When I tried to play it,the disk stopped half way through the movie and would not play after that.Price to good to be true.Cirque du Soleil-Dralion"
2,cirque du soleil,"I live in Florida and have seen LaNouba several times... Since the price has gone completely over the roof, I wouldnt even think of going again. That old Cliche ""there are no bad seats in the house"" don't belive it. You absolutely don't want to be up front in any of the Cirque performances... Now back to DRALION. I found it boringbeyond words, too much juggling and the singer seemed to be the main attraction always dressed in exotic over the top gowns and a voice that sound like the wrasping of the birds in the movie ""Pysco"". she should have just not be in the performance at all. To say I was disapointed with this DVD would be an understatement. Buy at your own risk"
5,This is the best!,"This is actually a Cirque du Soleil performance. I saw this live in Chicago, IL and the DVD is just like being there. The multi-angle camera capability lets you focus on the performer.The truth be known.... I take this DVD on all my plane flights and work while listening to the music. Which can stand on its own merits.Awesome! Buy the DVD from Amazon TODAY..."
1,dralion,I'm guessing it would have been good - if I had received it.I order so much I overlooked this one
2,Stars are for the clowns only sadly... :-(,"As a big Cirque enthusiast this show I have to say was the most disapointing of all the tours I had seen at the time and even now with Varekai being probably the best show they've ever created, this show just falls flat.It isn't smooth, the music isn't nearly as good as their other tours and in a word it was just dull compared to all the other Cirque tours. It looked and felt like nothing but recycled acts from prior shows thrown together with a few new twists, new costumes and music.The only truly shining moments of this tour were the clowns who were superb and it is a real shame that their fabulously funny numbers were the only highlight of the show the 6-8 of us saw that day.Yes as compared with the average circus it is stil superior to anything else out there but compared to its predecessors it just simply doesn't stack up."
4,Much improved Cirque DVD,"I have seen La Nouba in Orlando and I instantly became a Cirque fan. I eagerly rented the Quidam DVD and I was very disappointed, the filming seemed awkward and didn't capture the energy of a live show. I'm happy to report that the DVD Dralion was much improved, complete with multiple angles and more effective camera work. There's even a feature where you can watch the sections with multiple angles separately. This DVD was exciting and the ""making of"" section really added to my appreciation of the show. I couldn't believe the show came together in 6 months despite many barriers (including language). The best thing I can say about this DVD is that I now want to see the show live more than ever! Well worth a buy or rental."
2,Polar Lights Star Trek Nemesis Scorpion Model Kit ...save your money,"This production looks fantastic, but assembly is made difficult by how flimsy the pieces are, especially internal components that have ""pins"" that break off easily. This is purported to be ""snap together"" but it does not hold together well and easily falls apart if handled much. The only successful way to insure integrity of the final product is to glue it, but again, the individual pieces are fragile. Product needs significant improvement. Very disappointed!"
4,"Excelente, pero la traduccion un asco","Excellent bluray... The only bad thing is the Spanish translation, is a mess, poorly made translation, please think before you translate do as bad translation...Excelente bluray... Lo unico malo es la traducci√≥n al espa√±o, es un ASCO, traducci√≥n mal hecha, porfavor PENSAR antes de traducir hacer tan mala traducci√≥n..."
3,Okay,It ranks okay. Not the worst I've seen but not the best. The quality's not bad content could use improvement.
5,Its good!!!!,"if you are a fan of Supernatural than this is a must for you. This anime series adds to the culture of Supernatural. The good and the bad of it is this: the original stories are excellent and add to the mythos and the remakes of previously aired live-action epsidoes are well done too. However, the 22 minute episodes are killer. It feels that you are being rushed through the story. Lastly, the way they drew Bobby Singer and John Winchester is hard to stomach. Jim Beaver and Jeffery Dean Morgan are naturally better looking i.e. character wise and better actors than the animators were able to produce. With that said I still give Supernatural: The Anime FIVE stars and look forward to the next season."
2,It would have been better with Jensen in all.,"They should have waited until Jensen was available to voice this whole thing, he did the last two. I bet if you sold the episodes seperately the ones Jensen did would exceed the sales of the others. Oh well thier loss. Sold it to the neighbor for her 8 yr old son, he likes ghostly stuff, it's just another cartoon to him. Only gave it two stars for Jared. Or else I wouldn't have given it any. I will stick with the original."
2,Regurgitated Plots of Seasons 1 & 2,"Let me start by saying that I am a HUGE Supernatural fan, and have seen every episode of the live action before watching the anime. I had to force myself to watch the whole anime series. Most of the episodes are regurgitated story-lines from season one and two of the live action series, except for the ones that deal with Japanese mythos. My love for the original show made me watch the entire anime. I don't recommended it, try to just watch the Japanese mythology ones. I feel that my time has been wasted by watching it, I don't know what I would have done if i had bought it. I had expected it to be episodes that could go in-between the first season's, other hunting tales that Kripke couldn't fit in. Instead approximately only 2 episodes are original plots."
1,were is dean,i feel this wAS A WAST WITHOUT JENSEN IN IT. WHY DIDNT HE DO THE DEAN PART. SORRY THIS WAS A WAST OF TIME.
2,ok,"recently have become a ""Supernatural"" fan. I had found that there was an animated series and thought that it would enhance the writer's ability to visually tell a story from not being restricted by the budget from a ""live action"" standpoint. Did this series do just that, yes. But the voice overs, overall flow of the story, and story telling where absolutely horrible."
2,Supernatural the Anime Series,"This broke my heart. I LOVE Supernatural the show, but this was just too odd. It didn't have any new story lines, just the same shows in animation. Dean's voice and character were all off. Jared P. brings life to Sam, which helps a lot. But they destroyed Bobby and Missouri Mosseley. I had to stop watching it after they brought out Bobby.I wish they would give it a second shot; come up with different story lines, remain true to the characters, and please, please back off on the cheese Anime stuff, it's only cute on Pokemon. The idea is there, the follow through isn't."
3,Ok,"The show is ok, but I definitely like the original show better. Maybe better if Ackles was in the entire series, so the brothers could play off each other better because that is what they do best."
1,French language?,One song is a duet with a French singer. All the others are previously available on other LODVG CDs. Not worth the money...
5,baker's hawk,"Really fine family movie. Good story, beautiful scenery. It's wonderful to watch fine actors like Clint Walker & Burl Ives ply theircraft. This is a keeper that I'll watch many times."
1,Lousey movis,The only reason I bought this movie is to have it in my collection of Clint Walker.The movie has a grerat story line but falls way short in the presentation.
3,Entertaining but flawed,Enjoyed watching this -- the performances by Burl Ives and the boy who played Danny were very good. But I was very disappointed the vigilantes won - they drove off Mr. McGraw and Danny had to release his hawk.
2,"Just a collection of episodes, ho-hum graphics","I bought this Oct 2008. The Amazon site still has no description of this (as of Aug 2009) and no reviews, so just a word of note: It is not a movie, but just a collection of a few episodes.The animation is 90s-ish (the corner-shaped elbows on humans, odd mouth movements, etc) which may be acceptable as a Saturday morning SDTV Fullscreen thing for your child, but left lacking when on Blu-Ray for the same child.[Spoiler alert] The story is the same in each episode. Core loses a spore. Spore chased down and recovered. Spore replaced into Core. Happy end. [/Spoiler alert]"
3,Animalia DVD,DVD is a good kid-friendly movie. It is broken up into 4 segments so you don't have to watch the whole thing at one time. My kids enjoy it.
3,Kids DVD,My daughter loves this movie. It is good for elementary school age kids. Not great family fare. I could not get more than a half hour into it and had to excuse myself.
1,Tastes awful!!,This powder tastes awful. Get spirulina in caplets if you just have to have it. It completely overpowers anything that you may try to mix it with.
2,Didn't Work for me,I even doubled up the dose and noticed nothing whatsoever. I still have half the bottle full. I don't know if I got a bad batch or what. Coffee in general does nothing for me but I am now taking green tea. It's cheaper and more effective.
1,No media or license,"When I received the shrink wrapped box, it had no CD or license, just serial number for remote access client. E-bay gave my money back, Symantec said they put wrong things in box, try another order. Will try again"
3,Consistently interesting but not always substantiated,"Badiou is a consistently interesting thinker. I find very intriguing his idea that politics needs to work at the level of thinkability and not at the level of material practice. To align politics with thought, he turns to a language of naming, a language that refers not to what things are, but what things could possibly be. Names must be localized within multiplicities. In abstract terms, this makes sense. But what would this look like on the ground? But perhaps my need to ask this question betrays my leanings towards politics rather than a metapolitics. Chapters can be hard to follow, and can presume conceptual clarity rather than provide it."
4,Amusing and Enlightening,"This was a clever children's book that definitely opens up topics for discussion. It explores discrimination, fear and acceptance. A great read for children in 1st and 2nd grade, but younger children would be amused as well. The illustrations are imaginative and fun. The writing is perfect for the younger reader (6 to 8 years old)."
3,Seemed like rape to me...,"Although I'm usually a huge fan of Laurie McBain's books this one didn't do it for me. I thought the hero, Dante Leighton, was an awful character. In one of the few love scenes in the book Rhea, the heroine of the book, repeatedly says No to Dante's advances. It was disgusting. McBain wrote the scene as if Dante could not stop himself and somehow knew that although Rhea's lips were saying no her heart was saying yes. I know this is an historical novel and modern law is not applicable, but in my mind it's still rape if she says no and he continues to proceed with his sexual advances. Because of this and many other reasons, the love between Dante and Rhea was commpletely unbelievable. McBain should have definitely portrayed Dante as far more sensitive and caring than he was. The secondary plots in the book were intersting and many of the other charcters (all the ship's crew!) weregreat. But Dante Leighton definitely ruined the book for me."
2,Not the best Kentucky cookbook I have read,"I was so excited when I saw the title of the cookbook. I collect cookbooks and have many from all over the world. I make a point in collecting Kentucky cookbooks as I grew up in the state and always look forward to recipes from home, many my mother made and I didn't get her write them down for me. This was not the best example of Kentucky cooking I have read. Many of these recipes are totally foreign to me and others are not made the way I have eaten meals all over the state. I would not recommend this cookbook"
4,Solid album,"Damn good cd, never understood how this one got missed. Strong songs with a solid production. All the songs jam on this cd. Check it out."
2,bad packing,"The product is okay, but the package is poor. I received a bag of papers in a very big box, and the bag of papers are open... It looks like someone already used it..... A bit disappoint receiving a product looks like it has been returned and resale."
4,Exactly as expected,"Good quality and weight. Purchased these for our homeschooled art class using pastels and they work fantastic and at a much cheaper price that pastel paper. Also, using the black really makes the colors pop."
2,Very hard on the stomach,"I don't even know if these work because every time I start a course I develop a sore stomach within a couple of days. If you're sensitive, this product is not for you."
1,didnt work,"This Hair,Skin,Nails formula didn't do anything good, i really didn't notice any different only that i feel more thirsty and got a more dry mouth and body while using this formula. I don't suggest this to anybody, save your money!"
3,They're ok vitamins,I don't know about making your hair grow or making your nails stronger but it's a good everyday vitamin. I gave it a 3/5 because I bought it specifically to help my hair grow and make it stronger which it doesn't do.
2,Don't know yet,When I first started taking this product it messed up my stomach so bad. It had me running back and forth to the bathroom and feeling sick. After a couple of days it went away. But I still have being using the bathroom frequently. It's been three weeks and I haven't noticed a difference yet. I'll repost in a month.
2,Not Sure,"I just started using this product two days back and my stomach is in really bad shape. I am going to give it a week or so, but if my stomach doesn't improve, I will discontinue using it..."
2,I got no results from this,It di dnot help me as the other reviews claimed it did. was not very happy with it though not everyoen should expect results.
4,Good Product !,I've been using these vitamins for over a month and they seem to be working pretty well. Both my hair and my nails are growing back faster than ever. Ladies if you have a lot body hair prepare to shave at least twice a week.
4,Futurebiotics Hair Skin and Nail Tablets,Bought this on the dr's recommendation. It has Biotin in it which is good for the hair which I also take in addition. Too soon to see any results.
3,Skin effective,"I'm a vegetarian and I needed a multivitamin. After weeks of taking this I noticed my dark eye circles disappear and my skin get a healthy glow. My nails did grow but they were extremely brittle and I ended up having to cut them off. My hair is pretty much the same.This product does indeed stink. It seems to be getting progressively worse as the weeks go by. I throw them one at a time in the back of my mouth to avoid the horrible taste. Overall it's good for my health and skin, but nothing much else."
2,not sure what is up with these vitamins...,"i bought this vitamins, not sure if they work or not, but something weird happened to it, it was fine when i opened the jar, but after ciuple of months, the pills had big black dots on it and smelled like rotten fish, i didnt risk taking them, not sure why that happened... so i opened the second sealed jar, and it was fine (yellow pills with a bit medicine smell) , lets see if it will turn rotten after a while like the first jar... anyone has experienced this?"
5,Enjoyable workout,"I love this 45 minute video. I have many of Minna's videos but this is by far my favorite. It gets your heartrate up a little, but you never really break a sweat. If you like power yoga and pilates you'll love this tape. I must also mention how hard the abs are! I have never had such a hard ab workout in my life. You'll feel stretched and toned when you're done."
3,This video is great IF. . .,"I think this would be a great workout for those of you who are advanced, and whose bodies are conditioned to perform the deep strength moves required by yoga and pilates routines. However, I am concerned because I think this tape is not for the average person. I myself am relatively new to the yoga/pilates form of exercise, and had a very hard time getting through this workout. The beginner modifications are unimpressive, and overall not too helpful in achieving a less than strenuous workout.As for Minna, she has a great personality. I found her far less annoying than your average fitness instructor. Perhaps some new comers will find the video appealing, but the bottom line is that (unless you are quite advanced) this workout will leave you feeling anything BUT relaxed and rejuvenated - a claim made on the video packaging."
2,Okay,"I thought this product was quite large, it was bigger than my hand though seems soft. Also I know it says colors vary but I thought they would at least be a solid color. I wish they had an option to choose color or even just an option for boy or girl. I have 3 boys and we purchased boy hamsters and we have a BRIGHT pink couch with neon green dots and fuzzy white inside to me it doesnt look like the picture at all, not exactly what we wanted but it will work, it is soft and big enough for both our hamsters easily so...."
5,LOVE but doesn't look like picture.,"I bought 3 of these beds. 2 for my guineas and 1 for my dwarf hamster. My dwarf hamster LOVES it. Even though it's a little on the big side she feels cozy in it. Both my guineas tried to fit in it and it kinda worked, but i thought they would have like a cushion in it cuz it looks like that pig is higher BUT it doesnt. All three of my animals are girls so the colors i got were awesome. 2 brown with blue dots. & 1 pink with lime green dots. My Chinchilla however can NOT fit in this. He is full grown. Well anyways i was pretty satisfied with the overall outcome. Not super fast shipping but fast enough :)"
2,Must be one heck of a hamster in that photo!,"These cups are adorable but they are more like BOWLS. HUGE BOWLS! My two gerbils decided it was great....AS A POTTY! lol...we had to take it out after they chewed through the metal that keeps it attached to the cage and dump it over and hide under it. Total disaster, but at least the cost was nice."
1,Three times the size the picture shows and horrible color option.,"I purchased this because my hamster needed a little bed to snuggle in. The picture shows one hamster fitting nicely. It arrived today and it is three times the size and different color than the picture too. I know it says color vary, but pink and lime green with white lining is a far cry from the neutral brown with black lining in the picture. Sooooo disappointed and hoping I can return."
1,not what I ordered,"I ordered this item as a stocking stuffer and it was nothing like the picture. It was pink and much larger than the photo. The photo on the actual product was of 3 hamsters in the bed. I mailed it back immediately (in the return envelope provided) and, according to returns, the item was never received so I was charged for an item I did not keep."
2,Don't Buy...,"When I saw this on sale, I thought it would be useful and the perfect gift for my hamster. However, there were two major things that made me realize that I wasted my money. First of all the bed is not as small as it may seem on the picture. It was A LOT bigger than necessary. The last reason being the fact that the hamster will not use it as a bed at all. Mine barely went in it. The only time mine used it was when she jumped or fell into it.*Long Story Short: DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS CRAP!*"
1,I HATE THIS!!!!,"My hamster that is a teddy bear hamster thought it was a bathroom once he saw it he went pee in it. It was gross, so we put it in the wash a though we would try it on our otherhamster for a bed and I came back from school and she had riped the bed apart! I was shocked!"
1,NO SUPER SLEEPER Delivered,Amazon sent me the wrong item-a cozy cup of which I didn't order instead of the super sleeper so I am quite dis satisfied as I spend a lot with amazon. I can see no way of contacting anyone to remedy the problem either.Unhappy HereThis evening I received an email from amazon giving me shipping and the cost of the item in the form of a gift card credit. Thank you for getting right on this. I appreciate your speedy customer service. I will be shopping with you againDavid
4,Works for most doors,"We used these in our last place, and they worked great. Stuck on the door easily with double-sided tape, stayed put, and were easy to use. However, in our new place, the doors are too widely spaced, and just slide right over it. I've heard there's a spacer you can get to solve that problem, but I've yet to find it."
4,Good performance,"The performance of the Israel Philharmonic under Maestro Mehta is simply superd. So as the soloists and choirs, the performance of the children's choir is especially delightful. The composition is newly commissioned, however, it is quite approachable, not those difficult to understand 20th Century stuff. However, as a DVD, the words sung should have been closed captioned. There should be some descriptive subtitle for clips included. All in all, an enjoyable performance but not the most thoughtfully produced DVD."
5,Best Bra Ever,"I've had my Enell Sports bras for a little over a year and they are just as fantastic today as the day that I received them. I've never worn a bra that was this comfortable or supportive and never moves, no matter how much I do, twist, turn, move, etc., the bra stays in place and I don't have to adjust it, now if I could just find a regular bra that could do the same thing."
1,HORRIBLE!,"I called customer service to get advice on what size to purchase after giving them my measurements and purchased a size 5 as told. This bra might work for some people, but not being able to adjust the straps makes it fit too close to my neckline. I would like to return it, but wore it once to workout in so now I am out of money and still don't have a nice bra to wear. I wouldn't suggest ordering this online!"
4,No Bounce At All,"I just got my new Enell sports bra and have already worn it running a few times. I'm very satisfied in that I experience absolutely no bounce. I love that aspect of the bra, and I really love that I only need to wear one bra versus the two I used to wear, which weren't nearly as effective. The fit is VERY tight -- so tight that it was difficult to put the bra on the first time, and, once it was on, it felt like I couldn't take a deep breath. After I started exercising, I eventually forgot about the tightness and could breath comfortably. As others have noted, I expect the bra will stretch out a little in time.The only problem I've had is with one of the eye hooks rubbing against my skin. I've had to readjust while exercising, which has helped alleviate the discomfort. I just hope this problem will go away once I become more proficient at squeezing myself into the bra.All in all, this is a great bra and a godsend for big-busted women."
5,Amazing!!!!,This is my second Enell sports bra and I will never buy another sports bra. This bra has more support then any other sports bra or combination of sports bras. Once you try this sports bra you will never go back to a different one. Makes working out enjoyable.
3,tight bra,verrrry tight fitting to the point of restricting breathing! I measured and ordered according to their size chart so I guess I got the correct size. Hopefully it just takes getting used to. I will rate agin if that happens. Pretty pricey too.
5,Great sports bra,Works really well the first time it was super tight...kinda hurt. But it molded to my body...there is a lil bounce 36 DDD somethings arent immune to gravity. But overall A GREAT bra and awesome support!!! Im cheap and will return anything i dont like in a heart beat...its a keeper.
4,Very Pleased,"I am very pleased with my Enell Bra and the shipping process from the Amazon vendor. When I first put it on the compression seemed a little tight, but when I was able to run comfortably for the first time in a long time I was so happy. You definitly need to hook it from the bottom up and I found it easier to put it on while laying down. As it gets warmer I will be ordering others."
4,A Tank of a Bra,"This bra does the job and is surprisingly comfortable. I just wish is wasn't so much bra... the back covers almost your entire back, and the front is higher than what I am used to. I had to get some new workout tops because the ones I had did not cover the bra. But again, comfortable and holds everything high and tight!"
5,Does what its supposed to,This bra delivers as promised - very little bounce when running or doing aerobic. For those women with a large bust you won't be disappointed in this one. I've tried many and this is the best I've found so far.
4,Best bra I've found,"This is the best sports bra I've found for large breasts (40DDD). I can now take zumba and other ""high energy"" classes without embarrassment or injury. My only complaint (and it's a small one) is the seam that runs across each breast that is very noticeable under shirts. I can only assume it's necessary for the structure of the bra which is what makes it work so well. Overall, I'm very happy with my Enell sports bra and will buy more in the future."
2,not enough support,"I'm only a 34C but can't stand the slightest bounce. I found this bra at a local store so I was able to give it a test run by running in place in the changing room. I tried several sizes and found it did not provide the support I needed, especially for the price. It was also difficult to put on and take off. Luckily the store also had the Moving Comfort Maia which I tested and then purchased as it performed well. This was 2 yrs ago and I still run in it, though I think it is time for a new one."
3,Check their website for sizing!,"These bras are really designed for a limited cup size. As a 36H, I was far too big in the boob department, but not wide enough ""around"" to be able to successfully wear this bra. Shame as I really love the concept, but the girls were too squished or the band was way too big.I ended up with a Goddess Sports Bra instead... just ordered two more as they are fantastic support for my shape. Happy running, big breasted cousins!"
3,Mixed review...,"This is undoubtedly the most uncomfortable garment I have ever worn. On theother hand, it keeps the big girls in place when I jog and that's no easy task.Will keep using it while searching for the bra that can do the latter yet still be comfortable!"
2,Try something else,I purchased this because of the amazing reviews for how supportive this bra is for large busted women. I am a runner and just can't quite find enough support. This wasn't it either. The fabric felt like it didn't breathe and just wearing it around my apartment felt it was too restrictive around my ribcage to breathe deeply. For $60 it should have some sort of adjustment around the ribcage. And I am not that large around...I wear a 38D normally. For the $$ I would try something else.
3,Lots of control but a lot of bra.,"I wanted a bra with a lot control like Serena Williams's bra, I think I ordered one size too small altho I usually wear a 36 C. They said it fit tight so I kept wearing it and it felt ok, altho it doesn't look that great under tops, too much bra! But when I played tennis in it, I realized that it was really tight on my chest, inhibiting free breathing."
3,Enell is just ok,"I've got to say that for the money this bra is kinda meh. There's no adjustment for the shoulder straps and the support is just ok, not bad, but not really all that great. Putting it on and taking it off is not too much work, the bra is not uncomfortable, but overall I'm not that impressed."
3,"Good, but not amazing/fantastic/ohmigawd fabulous","My expectations were raised a bit after reading all the glowing reviews so I was slightly disappointed in the bra. I expected less movement in jumpy activities. Now, that's not to say it isn't a good athletic bra and that it doesn't provide good support, it does - especially for a larger breasted person - since that's my situation. I can't speak for how it would work for an average sized woman. I'm a 40G - so maybe there just isn't anything out there that can really keep these honkers from bouncing except surgery. It's been challenging to find ANY athletic bra for my size so I'm grateful for this one. It does help a lot, it's not uncomfortable (even though you are totally squished and it's tight... but that's supposed to be the case) and the price I paid was reasonable. So, all in all, I like it and use it and maybe just have to accept that I will never do jumping jacks again. :o)"
5,industrial strength,"my last enell was 10 years old , ran a marathon no prob.(with the bra anyway). I accidently ordered one size too small but breathing is overrated anyway."
1,way too big for 34d,by measurements/sizing charts etc I ordered the size that should have fit 34D - it was way too big up front - I returned it and got myself 34D moving comfort Maya instead. Much better fit for me.
3,Shaped for someone with anatomically abnormal breasts!,"I normally wear a 32D in most bras. I tried this one in a 32D, and the horizontal seam was well above the fullness of my natural bust. Maybe I just needed a smaller size cup, but with all the hooks and eyes, this was a pain to put on and take off, so it wasn't worth my time to try a different size. Hooks and eyes wouldn't have been so annoying if I wasn't a nursing mom, but being a nursing mom, you can't make baby wait a long time while you unhook 40 (yes, I'm exaggerating) hooks and eyes. I love the CW-X Xtra Support Zip Bra, but was only able to find ONE in my size (and not at Amazon) on the internet. Still looking for the ideal sports nursing bra for a tiny frame, larger bust woman."
3,Dissapointed,Ordered based on my measurements and their size chart and it was way too small. Vendor would not exchange. Very dissapointed.
5,It Works,"Great sports bra. Very little movement. Holds the girls in wonderfully, and provides excellent back support."
2,Not my favorite sports bra,"I was looking for a good sports bra to wear while I work out and found this one through various reviews and was excited to have a bra that had lots of support for larger women particularly during exercise. When I received the bra I took the labels off and put it on. I wore it around the house before going to the gym. I didn't like it mainly for two reasons: 1)when I moved it also made a squeak sound, and 2)the way that it closes with many hooks in the front made it difficult to put on and take off. So, I was going to return it, only IF you take the tags off, they won't take it back. So now I am stuck with it. Looks like I will wind up giving it away. I found a better sports bra at Catherines that was half the price and zips up the front."
2,Too tight,Super intense....I figured out that a regular sports bra is just the way to go...None of the sizes would fit right on me. Either the banding was too tight and the cup just right or the other way around.
5,ENELL SPORTS BRA,"My product arrived within 3 days in excellent condition. I have been totally satisfied with this purchase. After 2 months of wearing this bra to work out, I have noticed that I am able to jog & jump with more support. I am planning to purchase another Enell sports bra for my co worker who is also a full figured female, who recently started working out for better health. I recommend buying this product from this seller with out worry, because you will be satified with your decision. It is better than I expected, I love my Enell sports bra."
4,Holds me in!,"For the longest, I've been searching for a bra that can accommodate my ample chest. When I read online that Christinia Hendricks wears Enell I had to try it. I do a lot of cardio and with this sports bra I have minimal movement --which is great! I will definitely order more."
1,SIGH!,SIGH! WHAT ELSE CAN I SAY? IT TRIES TO BE A COMEDY BUT I WAS DEPRESSED. BRADLEY? HE CAN'T ACT.
1,Possibly The Worest NInja Movie Ever Made!,From watching the other American Ninja Movies I thought that this movie would be as good. I was shocked when I saw how terrible this movie was compared to the movies before it. This movie in no way depicts the real ninja or any other Martial arts style. The acting is Bad and the special effects are worse. The plot is totally far fetched to say the least. Please don't waste your money on this poor attempt of a movie.
3,a far fetched sequel,"Too right, American Ninja 5 is clearly aimed at kids, with scarce violence, hiperactive martial moves and ""mystical"" ninjas flying around. Special effects are terrible, martial arts coreography is quite good (for a person who enjoys martial arts) and acting is very B, even Z, I'd say. Not a bad movie if you're 12 years old or really into martial arts. David Bradley is not that bad acting, I've seen worse martial arts actors, and I wreckon the kid who played Hiro sucked a little more. Ninjitsu aspect of the movie just goes to far fetched: ninjas of all colours, bad special effects, an invincible David Bradley, who finds all weapons effective and little-realistic blows. Lacks the magic of the first movies but still good for kick and punch fans."
3,Worth a look if you're a martial arts fan,"The fifth part of this saga may not be the best one (the carisma of Michael Dudikoff was unique) but in my opinion, it's definately worth a look if you are a martial arts fan. To start off with, Michael Dudikoff was not a martial artist. David Bradley is, so the fighting sequences and coreography are a lot better than the first two movies. On the other hand, I have to agree with the other reviewers as it being a cheesey movie with a story that just wastes the clich√© and certainly aimed at kids. In a nutshell, the perfect movie to watch on a Saturday after lunch. Very inoffensive but with good martial arts moves and in my opinion, except American Ninja 3, 4 and 5 are two very good martial arts films with an actor who is not so bad in front of the cameras."
5,This movie had the worst acting. I laughed harder than ever,"This movie is great, and is so funny I pi**ed my pants, and my friend had an asthma attack."
5,Bladderwrack,This stuff works it has helped me lose weight. I havnt been able to lose weight for two years .I saw this in eat right for your blood type diet for type o so I tried it and it works.
3,I will Not be Broken is her best in years,"Lead off single ""I will not be broken"" Is one of the best Tunes Bonnie Raitt has found in a long time. If given the proper exposure it may be a new ""I will Survive"" for the 00's. The blanace of the cd is classic Raitt, nothing as powerful as ""Broken"" but a good effort all in all."
3,Bonnie's Got Soul,"Souls Alike is another solid collection of songs from veteran rocker Bonnie Raitt. The album opens with the superb ""I Will Not Be Broken"" that is done in the rock/ballad vein that helped properl Ms. Raitt from a journeyman performer to a superstar. ""God Was In The Water"" is a deep, dark and funky track while ""Unecessary Mercenary"" has the wickedly good slide guitar and thrashing keyboard. Ms. Raitt experiments a bit with the spacey ""Deep Water"". The album's closer is the best track, the jazzy ""The Bed I Made"" that contains some deeply introspective lyrics."
2,my least favorite Bonnie Raitt CD to date,"Just saw Bonnie in concert here a couple of weeks ago, and bought this CD there. Had I heard it first, I wouldn't have bothered. She said more than once in the concert that she is going to have Maia Sharp write a lot more tunes for her. If so, I won't be buying a lot of her CDs in the future, as two of Ms. Sharp's songs on here are just noise. I've never owned a Bonnie Raitt CD before where I run over to the CD player and hit ""skip track"" more than once like I do this one. I am really disappointed in this one - - it's not up to par with everything else she's done. Bonnie was fabulous in concert, however, and her voice is a musical instrument."
2,Stay with the older style,I've always been a Raitt fan since the '70s. Gave this new one a try and was very disappointed. The style seems to jump around and is not the sound she's known for. All you need to hear of this one is the free samples. Don't suggest you buy this one if you really like the songs she's built her rep on.
2,disappointing,"I'm a Bonnie Raitt fan...loved her music for years. I bought this CD because I liked the 1st cut, I will not be broken. Unfortunately, I should've down-loaded just that song, because the rest of the CD is bad!! That's it. There's not another song on that CD I want to listen to. I wasted my money...and I can't believe it!! Raitt is usually awesome!"
2,Cruise Control Bonnie,"I don't know why I was disappointed with this. Ever since I saw her in 1976 after an explosive opening set by this guy named Tom Waits, I always expect that same sort of rip your guts out slide guitar and scorching blues/rock sound I heard back in those days.29 years later I can't say any of her albums have been able to capture that sound I recall. Oh, well, it's an old recollection. (But I still recall Tom belting out, ""The piano has been drinking, not me. Not me.)Ms. Raitt's albums always seem to be these slickly produced, VH1-friendly collections of other people's songs-hence the awards and sales, etc. This one is no exception. Each song has a made for TV SUV commercial quality to it I just find more than a bit dull.So, curl up, cross that still nice leg underneath you there, purse up those thin, nicely painted lips, sip from a nice hot cup of green tea, adjust that brand new laptop just so, and click NOOOOOO on this review...."
2,Not my favorite,"If you like Bonnie's Road Tested or Luck of the Draw, this is NOT the album for you. It's along the lines of Fundamental which is one of my least favorites. Hard to find a track to sing along with...."
5,Album Review-Bonnie Raitt,"I really enjoy this album. Bonnie is really at peace with who she is. I really like the fact that she says that no one can make her do or say what isn't true. In other words, what you see is what you get. I am pleased with the service I get from ordering from Amazon.com.."
3,"Good, but I like the OLD Bonnie better!",The styling on this CD was unlike any other Bonnie Raitt CD I've ever heard. Takes some getting used to!
5,A FINE PIECE OF WORK BY THE MASTER!!!,"THIS IS THE MASTER IN HER FINEST HOUR...SHE'S RAW, GRITTY AND UNBROKEN BY THE EVER-CHANGING MUSIC TRENDS THAT PLAGUE THE INDUSTRY. THESE TOP-FLIGHT MUSICIANS REEL AND ROCK LIKE THERE'S NO TOMORROW...""DEEP WATER"",""UNNECESSARILY MERCENARY""AND ""TWO LIGHTS IN THE NIGHTTIME""ARE JUST A FEW BREATH-TAKING PERFORMANCES.EVERY SONG ON THIS CD IS A MASTERPIECE!"
4,Varied and good colletion,"Bonnie gives us one of her most varied collections with everything from beautiful slow songs to impressive grooves. I have always liked Bonnie Raitt's ability to infuse a song with emotion. Her opening song is a classic song of strength, a true pick yourself up when your down song and so is second song ""God was in the water"". Just listen to her groove and slide guitar textures on ""Two lights in the night time"" and you'll see why continues to amaze. This a real musical gem of a cd."
3,Not Her Best Work,"Lord knows I've been a Bonnie fan ever since I saw Stevie ""Guitar"" Miller disrespect her on some tv show many years ago when they were interviewing with the host together. Papa Come Quick and Love Letter are my two favorites with Luck of the Draw and Nick of Time being my favorite albums. I even saw her at the Fillmore in Denver on her birthday last Nov. when she was touring to promote this album. But, this album still doesn't quite measure up. I mean it's pleasant enough. But, I don't find anything really outstanding about it. I would have posted 3 and half stars over a 3 rating. It's not quite a 4 star album. Sorry to disappoint you."
5,WONDERFUL,This is definately one of the best Kelly cd EVER ! The songs are wonderful and make you dream ! Singing for their dead mother makes the album ALMOST HEAVEN
5,Absolutely a Great Time!!!!!,"My best friend used this game as the center of her 14th birthday party. It was absolutely fantastic. The only part of the game that was inapropriate to someone our age was that one of the characters did some things that aren't incouraged in our society today.Three of us figured out the murder(s), but no one knew the circumstances. My character was the murderer.One of our two flaws were that one of the characters gave away one of their conceal facts by accident. We all knew that every one had a motive to kill Rock but none of us ever figured out the motive of his manager.The party was fantastic, every one dressed out. Some even added an accent to their character. The best part was that we were all girls so some of us had to dress like guys. We even had two girls playing the part of one character, but that worked out fine.I turned 14 about a mounth ago, and now I'm planning on having a How to Host a Murder Party as well."
4,What a super story.,What impressed me most about the book is that is that author so much care to produce such well developed characters. It is a story of friends not just a love story of Harriet and John but story of Hariets' life and her friends. Ocassionally I wanted to jump over the friends bit but I think it is this full and wholesomeness that gives the story its charm. Wonderfully well developed characters and a super story. Thanks
4,A wonderful rendezvous with romance,"The way the characters are portrayed and laid out in A Promising Man is so realistic you'll root for them throughout the whole book. I loved this book! It's about a Londoner who's down on her luck in the love dept. She meets a man who she believes is dating her nemesis from high school and falls in love with him. But will they actually ever get it together? With many mix-ups, misconceptions, ill communication and much deception; it's hard to say up until the end of the novel. Quick & fabulous Brit Chick Lit read :)"
4,Fun Read,"I read Young's ""Asking for Trouble"" and did not care for it, so I started this book with some apprehension. I am halfway through it now and must admit that it is much better than ""Trouble."" It even had me laughing out loud on several occassions. Young uses a lot of British slang in her books, so if someone isn't familiar with the words it may get a bit confusing. I have been enjoying the book and can't wait to see how it ends."
1,"""The Bible Slammed"" would be more acurate .....","I didn't know and the cover doesn't say whether the DVD was going to endorse the Bible or present it contrary to its own testimony,""inspired of God"" 2 Tim.3:16. The first 52 minutes ""argues"" there is no archaeological evidence of camels, Philistines during Abraham's time and no evidence of Abraham ever being in Ur, so therefore the Bible is wrong on those issues. (I guess there is nothing left for archaeologists to find, they found it all!) ""Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence."" They also say Abraham, Isaac and Jacob were never father, son and grandson with no proof and contrary to archaeological finds! Go figure! Just more Bible-predicted degrading of God's word."
3,Review of Wiedemann's Greek and Roman Slavery,"This collection of primary source passages would be immensely approved if Wiedemann had endeavored to separate passages on Greek slavery from passages on Roman slavery. Roman, Greek, Egyptian, Assyrian, Persia: each major imperial power had its own system of slavery. It seems naive to mix together these two as though they were identical.Beyond that very pressing problem, this is a useful tool for primary source research on slavery in Greece and Rome. The translations look fine, often include glosses of Greek and Latin terms, are are grouped into important themes."
1,"Poorly Written, Full of Cliches","I couldn't get past the first two books in this set. The first seemed really dumb and contrived...we knew what was going to happen, the characters seemed flat, and it didn't really keep my attention. Book two further convinced me that this series was NOT worth reading and was more of the same mechanical writing and contrived plot. Disappointing. If you enjoy this type of book, I would recommend ""Dakota"" by Lauraine Snelling and ""Colorado Wings"" by Tracie Peterson."
1,Do not buy this!,"In December 2007 my brother purchased a gift subscription for this magazine for me. I filled in and send off the activation code required and have received nothing a year later! I have emailed and telephoned Bauer Media trading as greatmagazines.co.uk and they have simply refused to do anything, saying ""You must provide evidence of the address you sent it to etc."" DO NOT BUY THIS!"
4,Skilter filter review,The Skilter is a good power filter for fresh or salt water aquariums. However the skimmer will only work with salt water tanks; Do not expect it to work with freshwater.The airline should be checked weekly to make sure it is connected and the airline filter is not clogged. This is a good second filter for tanks 40gal and up.30 gal and lower a good primary filter.
3,good,This filter works great for me as I'm very experienced with all kinds of filters.It must be put togeather correctly or very noisy.As I don't have a sump for my 90 gallon reef tank I need a hang on skimmer.This filter works great for me.
4,Best product for the price.,Met all my expectations. Best value I was able to find. Only drawback is picture in picture requires an outside tuner. I was not able to get the vcr to serve as tuner.
2,Samsung cant hold a candle to SHARP aquos LCDs,"Bought this over priced fair performing LCD.I needed a better interface for my Crestron Adagio system, the Samsungs had a horrible interface for IR control.Jumped to the SHARP for its serial control.The Aquos is Great LCD, better price..."
3,Fretless AZM - Oceans Of Light,"Oceans of Light continues Fretless AZM's explorations into electronic jazz -- this time with ""live"" feel that augments the compositions. ""Waltzing in Love Again"" has a mini-breakdown towards the middle that helps vary the pace, and the next track, ""Between the Rhythm,"" seems to grow from it. ""Yassassin"" doesn't seem to know where it's going, and the same goes for ""Obvious Mutation."" The smoothness of ""Santiagio"" goes a long way to paper over some of the more flawed tracks, though, and ""The Ears Have Eyes,"" is a guitar-strumming bliss. Hit-or-miss, yes, but a few more hits than misses."
1,Not worth jack...,"Trust me ~ If you're a Yaoi Fan there is only one scene in this damn disgusting movie you'll like. And that's when the dude is running down the stairs in the nude, otherwise it's all just him screwing all the chicks he can at the same time. I couldn't see a plot, it only relied on porn. Disgusting movie. If there was anything lower then 1 star I'd give it to this stupid movie."
1,Bad master + DNR,Very old master wich has a lot of DNR that doesn't helps. All this result in a near DVD quality.
3,Not for the sqiemish....,"A cult-classic, American Psycho, is about a young, well-off young man, who loves himself almost as much as he loves killing. Christian Bale (Batman Begins) plays a homicidal maniac so well that I seriously was stuck in the moment-by-moment details of this movie. I stayed up all night just imagining the scene where blood splattered against his face as he killed one of his victims. This movie really shows the sickness that can be under a seemingly ""normal person."" Wealth means nothing, beauty means nothing....your co-worker could be a murderer."
5,please read the novel first.,"i am sick of reading reviews from people claiming the film was ""too confusing,"" and the scenes could have been ""more violent."" don't write a review about a movie that you know nothing about and don't understand. it's a satire, not a horror movie. read bret's books before you start criticizing his filmic adaptations. ellis is one of the most underrated writers of the 20th century."
1,Complete piece of crap,Utterly horrible movie with no logical plot or progression. The acting is laughable with Patrick talking in the same tone of voice during the entire movie. The writing is childish with some of the most hilariuosly bad scenes I have ever seen. The ending was the final draw in an already bad movie. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS FILM!
1,too bad I can't give it zero stars.,"I am writing for the soul purpose of keeping someone from wasting there time and money. I did not read the book. Anyways, I saw the movie and must say it was one of the top 3 worst movies I have ever seen. Bad acting, bad plot, bad script, and bad effects. I am not sure if they are encouraged at amazon to can bad reviews to increase sales or what or if the people who wrote the reviews saw the same movie I did. The movie was in the theaters for how long? That should tell the story right there. PLEASE DO NOT MAKE THIS PURCHASE, THERE ARE BETTER FILMS TO PURCHASE!."
2,"Odd, very odd...","This film was like a very bad made-for-cable movie. There was no plot, and when you think you have a chance of figuring out what is going on, the end comes, and you have no idea of what just happened. Christian Bale is normally a good actor, but in this movie he is a really bad over-actor. The only reason this is getting 2 stars instead of 1 are the visuals. Aside from the plot and the acting, the film is the definition of surreal. When else are you going to see a nail gun pointed at the back of a woman's head or a prostitute being chased by a naked guy with a chainsaw. That's about all the movie is about, folks. If your feel like wasting time and money, rent (or buy) it, but I'd just wait for cable."
3,Wasn't as good the second time around.,"First time I watched this movie 8 years ago I was high and drinking heavily. I thought the movie was good enough to buy, but after seeing it sober I wish I hadn't bought it. Moral of story is ""STAY SOBER"" your life is more dull but you make better decisions. AMEN...."
2,"Not very good, seen it before","The premise seems forced and overdone, the ""twist"" was predictable, and no real social commentary was achieved. I think it was due to either a bad director, or poor delivery by Christian Bale, because he really didn't do a great job. I would recommend rewatching other movies rather than going to this one."
3,"Good movie, avoid the book","This is a pretty good movie. Christian Bale is great, and there are some very funny moments. The director Mary Herron deserves credit for salvaging something out of Brett Easton Ellis's vomit-inducing novel.That is my real goal for posting this review: warning viewers to steer far clear of the book. Trust me, I am doing a valuable public service. You may be curious about the book because you liked the movie, but STAY AWAY! The book is a big, heaping, stinking pile of trash. If you thought the movie was voilent, you ain't seen nothing yet. Unlike the movie, the ""satire"" of the book gets utterly lost within scene after scene of depravity. You have been warned. Flipping through this book is like peeking into Ellis's toilet several hours after he ate a very large meal. You might find some pages of his book floating in there too, because that's all it's good for."
2,Moving beyond adaptation,"While I agree that Harron and Turner's adaptation of Ellis' dialogue and themes is masterful, the subsequent presentation borders on the mundane. The writing duo trim the 399 page novel down to a workable film length, but then add certain mindnumbing and distracting scenes which cripple the pacing of the film. In particular, the chainsaw sequence becomes a lengthy chase scene reminiscent of a film student aping Brian Depalma aping Hitchcock. Derivative scenes such as that not only mar the film's pacing, but move the film from dark satirical comedy to ludicrous farce. Maybe Harron was a better choice than Oliver Stone or those pushing for a ultra-violent version, but better is relative and should not be confused with excellence."
3,plot?,"The sardonic handling of wall street mentality is a little entertaining. The dialogue from Bale such as his rants about 80's pop artists, was fun. But overall the movie really fails to have a plot outside of ""guy kills people in twisted and colorful ways."" I don't know, is that all it takes to get 5 stars from so many? Perhaps this is a commentary on the audience. If you see it and aren't repulsed by the violence towards women, you may continue to watch and be entertained and then be confused by it's ending. Thank you director, for toning down the violence of the book, still though, this really just emphasizes the lack of plot. 3of5 because it did have a few laughs."
4,Its not a comedy!,"I just saw the movie, and decided to see wat you people had to say about it - and after reading 10, only one (Alexander from London, UK) seem to have captured the essence of the film. It is not a comedy but a studio in grotesk behavier and if it makes you laugh instead of being chocked or intriged you are seing it the wrong way. Allso the end seems to go over your head, DID he infact kill them all or did'nt he?!?! And you have to be a woman to suggest DeCaprio instead of Christian Bale, DeCaprio is way to little and not the actor that Bale is... All in all the movie keeps you watching intense but i think it should have bin made more scary - I would call it an interesting thriller with a twist and very well played, but not a classic."
4,This is not an Exit,"The title may throw you but this is not some cut 'em up horror flick. I was laughing out loud when I saw this film and the evilness of Bateman (Bale) was so quirky that it made his character likeable, well as likeable as a murderer can be. The way the yuppie lifestyle is portrayed is pure genius and great performances by all especially Bale and Defoe make this film a wonderful black comedy. This movie may be criticsized for making people insensitive to murder and somehow glamourizing serial killings but this glamourization is essential in capturing the sociopathic nature of the character in such an egocentric time in America's history. If you buy this film you will be thoroughly pleased. Side note: For an even deeper disection of the mind of the yuppie serial killer read the novel American Psycho, you wont be able to put it down."
5,American Psycho - Is for anyone who wants to great satire,"I find satire sometimes a toss up, as far as, will I like tomorrow. But this movie I will LOVE forever. As dark and evil as it is, it clearly, shows us that not killers come in the same package. Which adds more depth to his character.Christian Bale and Reese Witherspoon are brilliant in bringing their characters to life.This movie I believe is under rated by those who pass satire off as ""over the top"" or ""uncomprehensible"". But this movie is hilarious and black. And the satire is breath taking. I hate that phrase but it's true.Watch this - ready to have a sense of humor. You'll feel bad at what you're laughing at - but remember, it is satire."
4,A psychological thriller,"I am a huge movie buff. When I was younger, I watched this for the first time and wasn't quite sure what was going on. After having read the book and watched it a couple other times, I got all of the subtle undertones in the movies. An excellent thriller to watch if you're OK with sex scenes, bloody murder and drug use.Christian Bale's performance as Patrick Bateman is awesome."
3,a little dissapointed,"The only thing I didn't like was all the discribing of the clothes all the characters were wearing. After a few chapters it got boring and I started to skip over the parts nameing the designers and type of clothes. I have the movie ,I hope its better."
4,Great film,"Christian Bale is perfect for this role. He is genius in this. It couldn't have been better. I cant quite put a genre to this, its one of those 'multi-genre' type of movies, but it can appeal to so many tastes. Its kinda twisted and naughty but great at the same time. A must-see."
4,Great movie and good actors for the low budget,"Some fans of the book complained about the film's lack of accuracy. I was quite satisfied with the movie and it made me want to read the book. For its time and budget, American Psycho is a well-crafted, cruel and dark comedy movie.If one sees through the violent scenes, vanity and the empty search for eternal youth are very well portrayed in the movie."
3,"EERILY WEIRD, BUT.....","I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO BEGIN WITH THIS FILM BUT NOTHING MORE THAN A MARGINAL RECOMMENDATION JUST FOR THE SAVAGELY HUMOUR IT PROJECTED. ALTHOUGH I DON'T MUCH BUY INTO THE SEX SCENES MYSELF BUT IT WASN'T ANYTHING LIKE DAVID CRONENBERG'S CRASH, THE MOST TRASHIEST, AND DISGUSTING FILM I HAVE EVER SEEN. THE SCRIPT WAS KIND OF WELL WRITTEN IN A SCRUFFY WAY AND LIKE I SAID IT WAS SAVAGELY HILARIOUS WITH SOME GREAT LINES IN IT."
3,Solid adpatation of the book - unfortunately,"All this talk of dark satire and biting commentary is beginning to sound a little tiresome. Have we really emancipated ourselves to the extent that we can look back so smugly and talk about the ""me"" generation of the 1980s? The psychotic behavior depicted here has always belonged in the schlock basket, and attempts to elevate it to mainstream cinema strike me as sad.On the plus side, this is an extremely deft adaptation of the book and the exclusion of the graphic throwaway violence of the latter does not detract from the visceral impact (although maybe one needs to have read it before seeing the movie). Pretentious remarks about cinema aside, the supposed ""distancing"" of the story through a fifteen-year lens does not offer any priveleged frame of reference. As a satire, social commentary or psychological essay, this movie is hard to stomach."
4,HMMM....,"I liked the guy personally.....he seems easy to get along with really. I guess. Well, this movie was a great one, but I'd categorize it under Dark Comedy myself. Sure the guy's killing people, but he prophesizes about the best Genesis album of all time before the murders! C'mon....how is that not funny? Really, ignore the nonsense about it's nonsense and watch it...if you figure it out it kinda makes you go ""Maybe I shouldn't be a businessperson afterall."" Recognition is the whole idea."
2,What the fudge,The acting in this never flowed the plot just got stupider at the end.although the thing with the business card's is too funny.My dad used to work in stock market in the 80's I actually remember one time when i was 5 or 6 him and his friends at our families house showing each other there business card's and getting all serious aboutit
2,Shock without value,"Does the main character have a split personality? Did he really do all those terrible things or did he just imagine it? The direction and screenplay are so bad, you'll never find out by watching this movie."
2,Quite entertaining - Blu-ray a bust,"You either like American Psycho or you don't. But the Blu-ray version, IMHO, is virtually identical to previous non Blu-ray version. What a waste of money. Get the NON Blu-ray version."
1,Are you kidding?,"Are you kidding? I mean, this movie has to be the worst i have seen in some time, it not the worst ive ever seen. The story line had potential...so why not use it. Acting on all parts was nothing to be desired, and the murder scenes...my cat does things that grosses me out more. The only thing that I liked about this movie is that I borrowed it before buying it and I could return it."
1,Total pile of garbage,"Gosh, what hype over a complete pile of garbage. If it was supposed to be ""disturbing and dark,"" the director needs to get over himself. David Lynch films, which are highly criticized at Amazon, are dark and disturbing. This looks like something a hormonal 14 year old would put together. The acting was terrible, except for the one shining moment of Reese Witherspoon's portrayal of Evelyn. Oh, and for the comment on those ""people that expected it to be like SCREAM or something""-- I despise Scream and those teeny bopper movies and this movie did NOTHING for me. It seems as if it were some sort of ""message movie"" to warn against the dangers of capitalism. The soundtrack was pretty good, but the problem is the best songs are not on the soundtrack. Do yourself a favor, do not waste your money or time watching this film."
1,Read the Book,"After first reading the amazing book, I was looking forward to seeing the movie and was drastically disappointed. Rather than weening out the best parts of the book to tighten up the story into a feature length film, the movie seemed like a random summary of the book, rather than a story in itself. The acting was wonderful and a few points captured the emotions and tone of the book, but it is nothing in comparison. If you want to experience the desired effect of this story of 80's greed and yuppiness, then skip the movie and read the book."
5,"An awesome movie to begin with, and Blu-ray makes it so much better","This is a great film, but I'm not going to go into the writing, acting, or directing, here - I like to rate the quality of the video, audio and extras when it comes to Blu-ray, because I think that's what people want to know - they can get all that other info off of a movie rating site.So how is the quality - in a word: FANTASTIC! The video quality is awesome, as only Blu-ray can provide, and the sound is captivating. I've heard people complaining about the transfer of this film and I disagree. The ""washed out"" or ""grainy"" look people are complaining about has nothing to do with the transfer - it's just how the movie is supposed to look. The washed out affect is there to reflect the mind of the killer, and how he sees things.Another great bd to add to your collection. I highly recommend it."
3,"great movie, DVD could be better","This movie gets better everytime I see it. I really think I love this movie. As far as the DVD goes, the features such as the interviews and trailers were okay. I was frustrated that this movie was missing commentaries. It really could have used a commentary. I think it would have been awesome if they would have had a commentary with Mary Harron, Christian Bale and Bret Easton Ellis. That would be worth buying the DVD for; but it doesn't and it looks like I'll be holding out for the special edition if they decide to release one. Over all, movie is good with great replay value. DVD is okay."
2,A waste of time...,"Sorry, but I have to agree with a previous reviewer who noted the ""sterileness"" of this movie. The author portrayed his role in such a cold, unfeeling way that I couldn't get into the movie. And I don't mean the kind of ""coldness"" that a crazy killer is presumed to feel. I just mean the acting itself didn't raise any emotions out of me other than embarrassment that I was watching it. The movie appeared to be just a way to get some ""hacking and slashing"" on the screen under the guise of a ""good"" movie. It fell short for me."
4,Wild,Even by today's standards this film seems like it pushed so many boundaries on so many levels. Bale gives one of his best performances ever.
4,Good Show,This is a very good movie! Not my favorite but I absolutely love Christian Bale. The movie was in perfect condition.
3,"Great movie, but where's the theatrical version?","American Psycho is a great movie. It was really interesting to see which scenes they decided to put back in. I personally think the theatrical version is better, and that is not included on this disc. I thought since it was a collector's edition it would have both. Nope."
5,Undeniable Masterpiece,"I watch the unrated DVD almost every week and it invariably never gets old. No film can duplicate the wittiness, the black humor, the satire of the decadence and excess of the Reagan 80's, the sadism, the delusion of the megalomaniacal characters, the soulesness, the nihilism, the narcissism, & the dichotomy of sheer madness and genius that is Patrick Bateman. For anyone remotely fascinated by the movie even if you are not an avid reader, the Bret Easton Ellis book will cut you to pieces - pardon the pun. The cast is dead-on(sorry again) from Christian Bale to Chloe Sauvingny to Reese Witherspoon to Jaret Leto to Willem DeFoe et al.It is important... crucial really, that one must see American Psycho more than once to fully grasp the complexity that comprises Patrick Bateman. View it as an investment, not merely a purchase."
3,Read the book first........,"I am a Christian Bale fan but have never seen American Psycho. So, I bought the book, read it, loved it...... Then I bought the dvd. Christian Bale played Patrick Bateman exactly as I would have imagined. I am sure it was hard to fit the entire context of the book into a film, as the book uses a lot of narration, but it was done very well. My only suggestion is that everyone read the book first to understand the characters and their motivation. Without the prior knowledge of what the story is about, some of the scenes seem overacted although they really aren't."
4,"Preconceptions at the door, please","American Psycho, in its literary form, is a difficult read, as it comes off as pure graphic exploitation. The violence is so strong that many readers were blinded to the sporadic humour of the piece, often laugh out loud funny. Happily, the film takes all the redeeming qualities of the novel and builds on them, creating another beast entirely. The film plays as a black comedy, not horror. There is a little bloodshed for the Fangoria hounds here, but most of the violence is off screen, left to the dark pits of imagination. Christian Bale gives a career making performance, making Patrick Bateman a ridiculous blend of Casey Casem and any masked axe wielding killer you could think of. But most importantly the film acts as a satirical look at the cultural emptiness of the eighties, and the emptiness of Bateman. Don't be afraid! This is a great film just waiting to be discovered."
2,Somehow A Nice Try But&#65533;,"I know. I shouldn't have gone to watch the film based on my favourite novel anyway. But I did. Out of curiosity. Wanted to see how bad it got, how much they'd ruined this great great piece of literature.In a way I'm surprised, positively. 'Cause the film has some good ideas, some good parts. Like the visualization of Patrick Bateman's apartment, or his anger caused by pure jealousy and unfulfilledness.But all in all, it is not a very good film. The story is reduced to nearly nothing. Some unnecessary (and very poorly done) stuff, like the killing of some policemen, is added which is very annoying to the whole concept. And although Christian Bale starts out well and is well-chosen for the role, he somehow gets too nervous in the long run.If you have read Bret Easton Ellis' superb novel, then don't go see the film. They couldn't have put it to the big screen anyway - but they did try."
1,....if only i could give it -5 stars or at least 0......,"Some movies are meant to entertain, some are meant to dazzle, while others dramatically captivate....this film embarasses the hell out of you after wasting your money on it!What a complete disgrace to the film buisness!!!What comes to mind after viewing this abominable waste of time and money?! I will let you figue that one out if you are stupid enough to get this! DO NOT GET IT!!!! Spare yourself the frustration and embarrasment you will feel after watching it.TAKE MY ADVICE!!!! Seriously, this is the absolute worst movie I have ever seen...none even come close!"
1,"Ok, guess you had to be there...........","Maybe the book made sense or something but this movie, although some of the dialogue was good in some areas, otherwise sucked really REALLY bad. I mean, I love the good ""chop em up"" movies as much as anyone (and believe me, i have taken a lot of criticism for liking even some of the worst), but this movie will leave you totally wishing you had your rental money back or even worse, the money you paid to buy it with. Just mediocre acting, not a whole lot of scary murder activity and an ending that will leave you totally lost."
4,"As social satire, this one's a killer!","Bret Easton Ellis' novel was a creepy, frightening portrait of self-aware yet detached evil. The movie version of ""American Psycho"", on the other hand, is a cleverly drawn social satire, choosing black comedy over graphic violence to make its point. The movie is closer in spirit to the similar Jules Feiffer-scripted 1971 classic ""Little Murders"" than say, ""Friday the 13th, Part VII"". The core subject matter is so dark and despairing that the occasional laugh-out-loud scenes are quite welcome when they occur.Christian Bale does an admirable job portraying Charles Manson as a Yuppie. Those who think Bale is too ""pretty"" and smart to play a serial killer should remember that Ted Bundy was considered an attractive,charming and intelligent person in casual social situations! Obviously not for all tastes, but a winner for those who enjoy a twist on the norm."
2,Don't waste your time,"I tried, I really did. In the end, I watched most of this in fast-forward, hoping that something just a few minutes later into the movie would redeem it. Heck, not even the soundtrack redeemed it, and I love 80s pop. The was-it-real-or-imagined aspect was rather neat, but the characters were just too weak. It's hard to make a movie work when none of the characters has any more depth than a shedded snakeskin and you just can't care if they live or die.I know the characters are supposed to be shallow (they are, after all, 80s stockbrokers - Hollywood's ultimate soulless weasel stereotype), but they lack even that much depth. It's almost possible to generate some sympathy for the prostitute or the secretary - almost. In the end you just can't care. Live? Die? Whatever - just get to the bloody point already.In the end, you'll feel exactly what the main character feels -- nothing."
3,Could use a little more cut & T&A,Buy the 1st American Psycho. It was more exciting the 1st time around. Maybe I was expecting too much. Still an excellent perforance from Christian Bale!!!
1,Undoubtedly one of the top 10 WORST movies I've ever seen,"This movie was terrible...almost unwatchable. The acting paralleled that of a high school play. I kept waiting for some interesting characters to develop, but they never did.Don't waste your time."
1,Don't do it!,Avoid this film if possible! The only thing I liked was the male nude scenes. It was quite a bad film :(
1,This movie is horrible,"American Phsyco was totally horrible. A bunch of people tell me that it is just great, so I go and rent it and bore my self to death for two hours. The plot is okay, but the movie just goes nowhere and gets very boring. I would not reccomend this movie to anyone."
2,"If you're a fan of the book, stay away from this film.","This movie is horrendous in comparison to the book. If you've read the book and really enjoy it, stay away from the flick. Several key events are omitted, the acting is poor, and the movie does not draw the audience in like the book does. The movie is corny and not believable.Pretending I have not read the book, I would still give the movie 2-3 stars, for the lack of good acting or pacing."
1,Haven't we been here before?,"Well here we go with some originality. A ""comedy"", or is it a satire, about the Eighties. In my opinion it's merely an excuse for bloodletting and Christian Bale to strip down all the time. I found it's intellectual content to be shallow, acting to be marginial, and it's moralistic overtone to be questionable. First of all why does it require death and violence to be a satire on America in the Eighties and second of all since when has multiple homicides been humorous? Looking over the reviews I'm not sure what I found to be worse. the fact that so many talk about the laughs that broke out during the murders or the folks who go on and on about the Eighties soundtrack and clothes. Perhaps the real statement about the American way of life should be the lack of reaction that this movies didn't invoke from people. I dare say we aren't so far removed from the Romans as we may think."
2,"Great film, so-so Blu-ray","I'm a little ticked at LionsGate, I thought the shaky picture quality of the first wave of Blu-ray's was a thing of the past, now this. There is ""ringing"" and dirt in this transfer and I think given the limited number of Bluray titles out there, they ought to make a more concerted effort at keeping the quality higher than this. I guess I was expecting more, and reading the faint praise of the other two reviews, I see it's not just me."
5,awesome,Absurdly post modern. It will blowv up your mind face. Girlfriends hate it. Reminds me of my days in Sam
4,Where was the psycho?,"Wo ich vo d√§m Titel gh√∂rt ha, han ich d√§nkt, hei das muess √§n mega psycho film si, aber was s√∂ll ich s√§ge, das isch ja henne harmlos!guet, zueg√§h, das mit dr motorsagi isch scho chli krass,aber ich meine he, da hei mir ja also scho vil schlimmers gseh,oder nid?

4,Chilling,"""American Psycho"" is deinitely NOT for the faint of heart. With tons of sex, violence, and drug references, this is one OUTRAGEOUS movie... This isn't to say that it's not good... it's just... sadistic. BUT... I have to say, that the black humour was well appreciated... kind of lightening up the disgusting subject matter of the movie. This was a very chilling and twisted movie... see it!"
3,Ho Hum,"There is nothing to really appreciate in this movie. Sure its supposed to be a satire but where is the joke in any of this? Christian Bale does give a great performance but most of the reviewers for this movie seem to be demented people or movie ""buffs"" who think they know all there is to know about movies. There's a great buildup in this movie that doesn't get released. I haven't read the book but they are never translated directly in the movie. Definitely a movie you should rent, but not worth buying."
3,Psychology majors only,"Unless you're a psychology major, you probably won't get much out of this movie. In this film we have our main character preforming various sexual acts throught the movie before violently attacking and often murdering his victims. Being interested in psychology, I saw more detail into the disturbed life of this corporate executive. I recomend this movie for those who are interested in psychology. For everyone else, this movie might be a waste of your time."
5,"review,review","Super good very scary and confusing. I would suggest this movies to anyone, the actor is great, and you are both attracted and scared by him."
3,This will make you think,"Patrick Bateman is a child of the rich 60's. We see him first as a succesful businessman on Wall Street where he works. He and his friends are rich, can eat where they like, live where they like, and go out with who they like. For some this was the 80's for most it would have been enough. Patrick hwever needs more. He spirals into a pit of violent and sexual depravity from which there is no return. If you like black humour and thought Fight Club was thought provoking then this is definitely a film that will have you laying awake at night trying to work out where he and perhaps society went wrong."
3,"Not a review, really","I just want to let people know that Mary Harron, the director, does her best not to show graphic content in this movie. Maybe the unedited version is different but the movie I saw never showed private parts, wounds, or even bared ... if I can recall correctly. There were plenty of scenes where other directors would have showed it all. I just wanted to let you know that it is better taste than you may expect. They do however show Christian Bale's ... twice, which is in any case one more time than they should've. Blame it on the female director."
4,One of the Darkest Films You'll Ever See,"I was intrigued by American Psycho when I initially heard about it. I didn't really know much other than Christian Bale kills a lot of people. Having watched it, this movie is probably one of the darkest if not the darkest film you may ever watch. It is very gory and quite disturbing at points. However it is quite thought provoking. It raises large questions about life and how one should live it. How we interact with others is a major theme of the movie. I was thinking something along the lines of Hannibal Lecter when I purchased this. It is not quite as thrilling, but far more terrifying in its insanity."
1,Don't buy it!!!!!!!!!!!!,All the comments on the blu-ray transfer are correct. I rented this movie 2 years ago and was blown away by the pristine pq. Lionsgate really messed up bad with this which doesn't surprise me. This is not the first blu-ray transfer from lionsgate they destroyed. These people truly are clueless on pq. My advise to all that love this film is to try and find a used copy that was released by Universal Studios.
2,As shallow as the people it purports to lambast,I kept waiting for the point of the movie. I guess it's just a chance for some professional film people to prove how hip they can be when setting up scenes.A real snooze.Pointless.
5,I like this movie for the shock of it!,"I had to have it, I'm one of those people with a great collection, and building, of the WELL MADE bizarre and thrilling movies."
2,"Dull, forgettable, over rated.","American Psycho is kind of a dull movie. Christian Bale's acting is occasionally interesting but the character of Patrick Batemen fails to gel.The oft-cited satire is played in a ham-fisted manner and comes off more as the usual propaganda from the usual suspects then anything revealing or entertaining.I felt the movie was overrated first, because of all the talk of violence when the film was released, and secondly because all the glowing user reviews.Since so many people do seem to like it, I would rate it a rent before deciding to own. This has been a review of the unrated version."
2,Is that it?,"The only thing good about ""American Psycho"" was Christian Bale's wonderful portrayal of the twisted Patrick Bateman. Otherwise, this movie went on and on aimlessly as we watch Batemen torment one victim after another until he has a nervous breakdown and then the movie ends. This film has a promising plot, but is missing someting vital. It was an empty film. I suggest ""A Clockwork Orange"" if you want a better movie under the same genre."
2,Not as good as the book,"American Pscyho is the most terrifying novel I have read. It gave me a very disturbing feeling that lasted more than a week. The film, on the other hand, fails to convey such a feeling. I don't know know why, but as i was watching the film,I thought it lacked that sharp and disturbing feeling."
2,NOT TO BAD,"KNOWING WHO THE MAIN CHARACTER IS NOW AND THE ROLE HE PLAYS IN BATMAN LEADS ME TO BELIEVE THAT HE'S LEARNED A LOT SINCE THIS MOVIE. ITS NOT BAD,BUT ITS NOT GREAT... IT'S ENTERTAINING AND YOU CAN SEE THAT IT'S UP AND COMING ACTORS TRYING TO PAVE THEIR WAY. COULD HE DO A BETTER JOB TODAY DOING THE SAME ROLE? YES, I BELIEVE HE COULD."
2,I've Seen Better Psychos!!!,"I bought this film for a good price having heard alot about it and with the word psycho in the title, I just had to see it. The only good thing about this movie is the bloody killing scenes. Other than that, I found this movie boring at times. To call it terrifying is going a bit too far. Even scary is a bit too far. If you like the serial killer type movies, you might like this one but don't be prepared to be blown away!"
1,If I Could Only Give it Zero Stars...,"This has to be on the top of the worst movies I ever saw. Thank God I rented and did not buy it. It was a very demeaning movie, especially to women and it left me with a sick feeling inside. Very disturbing to think so many people gave it such high marks. It wasn't funny or scary...just disturbing and stupid. I highly Don't Recommend!!"
1,a total waste of time -,"kids and teenagers love christian bale, so it has that going for it and it does have potential, but mostly this movie is an overly self aware and tedious slasher ""black comedy""- I did watch the whole thing, however, so I guess it's better than one star-- but not quite 2."
1,Worthless Junk,"This film is boring from the start and I couldn't wait until the end when all my suspicions would be put to the test. What I was expecting is at least an attempt to make an interesting picture. This movie suffers from confusing direction and bad plot lines. We don't know whether to take this movie at face value and think of it as satire (badly done) or a horror film (even worse). Bale is terrible as a spoiled yuppie who has an urge to kill and have sex and wash his (blank) clean. This doesn't even bring interest to a retarded person, I don't know what film the reviewers saw who gave it thumbs up, they must have been drunk."
1,This Movie is Horrible,"I had the misfortune of seeing part of this disturbing film on cable the other night. I saw the part where Christian Bale has two women in his apt. performing sex acts on each other, while he directs their every move and films them and himself. It was totally degrading and gross. I turned it off after watching in disgust for a few minutes. What a misogynistic piece of garbage."
2,not impressed at all,"I was so excited to watch this movie- well I wasn't impressed at all. The entire movie was predictable- and the fact that it was all in his head wasn't a very good ""twist"" at all. Besides Christian Bale, every other actor and actress was very annoying in this movie. In the end he goes on a killing spree that is more hilarious and over the top than shocking and horrifying like this movie wants you to think it is.I think this movie could have been made much, much better- the killing scenes could have been more violent- the sexual scene in there I thought was totally unnecessary, the girls weren't even pretty. Although I do have to say the sex scene does get the point across how sadistic and disgusting Bale's character really is- and that is what basically is the only good thing about this movie- Christian's character and the way he plays it. The plot line is bad and needs to be redone or made better."
4,Wickedly Entertaining,"Bale shines in this here doozy of a cinematic tresure. One of the better black comedies with brutal horrific elements, American Psycho should strike a chord in many.Though it pokes fun at the 2nd greatest US president (Reagan), I couldn't help but nod my head in approval as the director brilliantly expressed her erroneuous views through this artful unfolding of a plastic man.Haven't read the book, but will certainly pick it up sometime soon as this film which should appeal to horror fans as well as indy film lovers and anyone with a slightly twisted sense of humor, is a memorable one for sure."
4,"Schrewd, Dark and very, very Funny","what a wild in your face dark comedy about the excess of the 80's lifestyle. Bale is excellent at depicting a character who has become so shallow and empty that he rebels in his American Psycho way. Scenes like Bateman in the shower and his morning prep routine and the business card comparisons are hysterical in the way the point out some of the absurdities and foolishness of this era. Bale is so slick and so wired in his extremes in behaviour and his voice over dialogues are performed to perfection. It is so subversively witty - that the social aspects of this time come across as almost more scary than the violence. Were we that bad? Other performances are great here too: dafoe, mathis, leto, and Chloe Sevigny who is the only one who can actually steal her scenes away from Bale. I used to work with a bunch of Patrick Batemans who had too much too early and too easy - I wonder what happened to them."
2,AMERICAN PSYCHO IS A PSYCHO PATH !,"CHRISTIAN BALE PLAYS A RICH , SNOTTY LUNATIC.HE WOULD HEARS VOICES AND SH!T.THEN HE WOULD JUST SNAP AND KILL PEOPLE.IT'S KINDA A COOL MOVIE BUT IT WAS DUMB.IT'S NOT SCARY.IT'S FUNNY AT SOMETIMES."
1,Strange and chilling,"My sister wanted to see this movie-I didn't. It was not what I expected. I normally like movies that make you think and are not main stream, but this movie sent chills up my spine. Patrick was a pig, plain and simple. He was a self centered, egotistical man who cared nothing of the people around him. I believe he lived in a dark fantasy world dreaming up that he killed all these people without anyone noticing. I don't think he fully understood how much the people he worked with and were so called friends with were laughing at him. The major problem with this movie is that there are people out there just like Patrick. This movie makes their fantasy a reality."
2,Interesting movie ruined by Cliche ending,"The movie started out very interestingly and though graphically violent it kept me interested throughout. Then the ending just ruined the entire film.... so cliche I wanted to ask for my money back. What a waste of a great idea exploring the excess culture of the 80's. I had not read the book so possibly it was better handled and explained in it, but if you have not read the book, the film ending is flat-footed and deeply unsatisfying."
1,Has anyone read american pyscho?,"It's not that bad for a movie that was obvisously only finaced because some fat hollywood producer was hunting for more copies of a 'gen X' black comedy fight club clone, satirical? sure it was meant to be the 1980's but we have progressed, the movie is naive of it stupidity. Christian Bale is perhaps the most tragic figure here, having altered his face and body so dramatically to play a role that spits him out onto the screen and makes him look like a tragic copy of Tom Cruise. If you see the film and you hate it, read the book, no print to screen translation can be worse than this, seriously."
2,I really didn't understand it,I got this movie for a friend for chirstmas and she loved the movie. Me on the other hand hated it. I really didn't understand the end of it.
1,American Psycho,"Whatever happen to movies without a message? If I wanted a Social message or a Message about Greed and the 1980's I'd pick up a Rag like the NyTimes or The Nation or some other Rag,The movie is over rated not only because of it's so-called description of the 80's(Wall Street-Another ""80's"" movie) but also due to it's lack of it making any sense,as much as Abstract Art Can be called ""Art"" I am sure others will disagree with me And call the Movie ""Brilliant"" and Factual. I say it's Just another so-called ""Smart"" movie where they were too lazy to write a Ending,but I guess it is hip not to make sense."
1,Just bloody awful,"I tried, I really did. I expected to enjoy this movie, even just a little. In the end, I watched most of this in fast-forward, hoping that something just a few minutes later into the movie would redeem it. Heck, not even the soundtrack helped, and I love 80s pop. Don't bother hitting ""pause"" when you go to the bathroom - you won't miss anything. The was-it-real-or-imagined aspect was rather neat, but the characters were just too weak. It's hard to make a movie work when none of the characters has any more depth than a shedded snakeskin and you just can't care if they live or die. Yea, I know the characters are supposed to be shallow (they are, after all, 80s stockbrokers - Hollywood's ultimate soulless weasel stereotype), but they lack even that much depth. They're wet-paper thin. It's almost possible to generate some sympathy for the prostitute or the secretary - almost. In the end the apathy wins and it doesn't even matter that it's only a movie. Who cares?"
1,A waste of time,"I love horror/terror/suspense -- all those movies. I waited with anticipation to see this movie... I wanted, I really really wanted to like it, and it just sucked. Many reviewers comments are ambiguous because they can't think of much good to say, but feel they have to. The movie was moronic. All that 80's humor, WOW! And another Kaiser Sose type ending. GEE! zzzzzzzzzzzz...."
1,Boring Without the Drill,"I recently watched this movie and must say I was terribly disappointed. Christian Bale did a good job, but he was failed by the script and the direction. I can't compare it to the book, because I have not read the book. If it was attempting satire it misfired. This was essentially a cross between the classic ""Psycho"" and a David Mamet play. The voice-over narration was intrusive, an almost ""Wonder Years"" gone dark. If it was attempting to discourse about the boundaries of sanity and insanity, this was already better handled In Roman Polanski's movie ""Repulsion,"" with Catherine Deneuve. The idea that preppies of the eighties were a shallow lot, and that some people in power may not be altogether sane is not exactly a news flash. In fact, the latter can be found in ""Das Kabinett Des Doktor Caligari.""Worst of all the movie was just plain boring. Hollow with cold surfaces."
2,"Horrible movie, but like seeing Christian Bale nude","This movie was such a disapointment. I thought it was going to be so voilent but it wasent. Only 2 murder scenes. There was more sex scences than murder scenes. The murder scenes didnt even show anything. In a later scene they show dead bodies all over the house but it never showed him killing them.Christian Bale is naked alot in this movie. Which was the only reason to watch this movie. His acting as a psycho was scary though. The ending made no sense. It was like he fantasized the whole thing. Confusing. Horrible movie, big let down."
1,Rent it - if you want to see an awful movie,"Let's just say that I wish I could rate this movie less than 1 star. It was the worst movie that I have ever seen, and I have seen some pretty bad movies in my time. American Psycho was actually painful to watch; I think I would prefer someone to tie me down and rip off my fingernails one at a time than watch this movie again if given the choice. The social commentary was valid but demonstrated in such an in-your-face-yet-trying-to-be-subtle-and-smart way that it completely lost any respect that it may have deserved. Christian Bale did a fine job portraying Patrick Bateman but he could not make up for the horrible dialogue, storyline, producing and everything else involved. I only recommend this movie to people who wish to see one of the worst movies to come out of Hollywood in a very long time. If you want to watch a good (sorry, great)movie with approximately the same commentary, buy American Beauty."
3,Bale's pyscho performance saves this one,"starts out great and ends great. though the people around Patrick Bateman really get what they deserve. the movies sorta let down by the combination of slayings and comedy. dont mix. can Bale be any prettier and he sounds so calm and then he breaks out into the psycho he is. favorite part has got to be the chainsaw part when Bale drops it and then goes AHHHHHH!!! with blood on his face, though did he have to put his running shoes on"
2,Luckily,the movie skirts around the really nasty issues found in the book. It is no less disturbing for it though. Christian Bale pegs the disassociative actions of a raging psychopath. Don't expect a happy ending here. Do expect to be wary of people for a few weeks after viewing the film.
5,Satire that all Men should See,This satiric commentary on Men and the 80s brings to life a deep roar of laughter behind a mask of disgust. A MUST SEE!!
4,Well done,"This is a real strange film, well done, with a lot of zest and a great performance by Christian Bale. I haven't seen too many of these humorous and cleverly done films made in the last decade."
2,I was disappointed,"The film is disjointed as it relies heavily on a previously gained knowledge of the novel. Bateman is not properly introduced and the film succumbs heavily to the afore mentioned fault. Despite this, if you have read the book, then the film is interesting to watch due to the images you may have created in your head and how they differ to those generated by Harron in the film."
4,A compilation of Bowens Family System concepts,Titelman offers a fairly complete compilation of topics related to how many therapists processed their professional and personal development at home and work. This book shows the evolution of a therapists journey in personal and professional growth.
1,Should have read the fine print.,It is packaged to look like it is the movie soundtrack. It is really a collection of bad reggae. I was very disappointed.
1,Buy the 2 disc import,"The 2 disc import version, has THE SAME songs, Plus an extra 19 on a second cd."
4,Underrated,"This is one of my favorite Newman albums. Mr. Sardonic is at his best here, from the album cover(a comment on the success of Little Criminals), to the very last song. Favs include The story of a rock and roll band(a tribute to ELO)Pretty Boys, William Brown, and Half a Man. Extremely under-rated, it's a must have for fans of Randy Newman."
4,Randy at play,"I have always found this album to be as playful in its nature as Mr. Newman has ever gotten. His self-parody on the cover says it all. And no particular strata of society is picked on. It's almost as if he's written songs about what he saw in the paper one morning. Spies, gay truckers, English rock bands, sheepish men, exhibitionists, silly rich people, a man telling about the women in his life, etc. Just random stuff. When you listen the songs compliment each other so well that the cd ends well before you are ready. As ever, the sound and musicianship is top notch. ""Half a man"" makes me smile every time I hear it. The picture he paints in my mind is truly hilarious."
4,"Only one complaint, otherwise, great pack","My complaint about this pack is that the shoulder straps are a bit wide and very stiff -- no problem if you have a larger frame, but I am fairly small, with narrow shoulders, and I had to return the pack because the straps were so unyielding.Everything else about the design of the pack is excellent, and I haven't yet found a good replacement. I'm hoping that North face will make a women's version available."
2,Don't buy new,The new ones available are Korean imports. Features do not work. Not stereo even though is claimed to be. Can not shut off sub titles. Will not play on a USA computer - just lock it up solid and you have to pull the power cord. Sound quality is very poor. Video quality is good. Pass on this - a big waste of money. Sorry I purchased it.
4,Blues Lovers' Must-have,"If you love the real blues, you'll love Liz McComb. She has an amazing voice. Somehow, she's not well-known in the States but I am sure a lot of blues manias in the world are wandering around to get her music even at this moment. Well, at least, I did. :-)"
3,It looked good,I bought this as a decal for my car. Started falling apart the day after I put it on. Very disappointed!!
1,"Amazon, fix this page","$33.23 is way too high for 1 pint of compressor oil. I thought maybe this is the price for a case of oil, but the technical details says, ""3/8"" x 50' Rubber Air Hose."""
5,More than a 5 star CD,"This CD really has inspired me. If I could give this CD a higher rating, I definitely would. I continue to enjoy all of the WoW collections, and will certainly be a futere buyer of others."
5,Very uplifiting and encouraging music!,This CD is perfect for those long days at work or road trips when you want something to listen to that you can enjoy every song on. It's very uplifiting and I give it a strong thumbs up!
5,Better than the other ones!,"This is a great CD for everyone who loves Jesus and for everyone who doesn't but only wants some good music! You can't listen to this CD and not want to dance! There's more variety, rock and jazz and everything! A must buy!"
4,Slowly going downhill,"WOW 1996 was an album full of the ""best of the best"". Now it seems that all these record companies are trying to do is promote new artists. Now don't think that I don't think this record is good...they could have just put some new songs from old artists in there..they did with Point of Grace and Amy Grant and such, but how about Anointed? It's about time they came out with a new album!! And WOW 1999 would have been the perfect place to debut the first single. But it really IS a must for any CCM music fan."
4,Best WoW CD to date,"This is a good collection of christian songs-- they mix up pop-ish and more alternative/rock entries well. With the exception of a few songs, most are inspiring and groovy. I think contemporary christian music is moving in the right direction."
5,One of the best CD's I've ever listened to!,This is the best CD I've ever listened to. The people who put this together picked the best artists and their best music. It is simply amazing!
3,Could Be Better,"I have examined the WOW cd's since 1997, but have never bought any of them, and will not buy this one. (I've heard them at friend's houses.) While the artist selection is indeed the top 30 artists, whoever selects the songs for the WOW cd's consistently picks the 2nd rate songs of the year for each artist. Why not put thier best hits on? If they did, they'd have one more customer in me. Main exception on WOW 99 is DC TALK-INTO JESUS, best song off their Supernatural CD, and their best song ever!!!!"
3,It's no WOW 1996 (or 1997 or even 1998) - that is for sure.,"I would just like to make a comment on the WOW series. I have enjoyed WOW 1996 a lot. However, it seems as though this series is getting slightly worse each year. The second CD of this set is GREAT but the first one is lacking. Actually the thing that it SHOULD be lacking is that Veggie Tales song. If I wanted to support Veggie Tales (which I choose not to), I would buy the videos."
3,GOOD CHOICE OF SONGS,I HAVE NOT LISTED TO WOW 99 AS YET BUT I HAVE LISTED TO WOW 98 AND I THINK IT'S THE BOM!!!!!!
5,Music,Great music. I love the hits and the sections. Thanks for bringing them in one location to be bought and enjoyed.
5,"Great music, lots of diversity!","I love my Wow99 cd! It has tons of cool songs that I love, and it has enough diversity on it that it doesn't get boring to listen to."
4,WOW is awesome!,"This is a really good CD. I had seen these CDs in stores before, but I never really paid any attention to them. When I got ""WOW 1998"" and ""WOW 1999"" for Christmas, I loved them! I liked all of the songs except for a few that were ""okay"". Out of all of the songs, probably 1/2 of them were ""Great""! This CD would be perfect for anyone who wants to know what all of the Christian singers and bands are like."
2,Not directly applicable to US market,"I was searching for a book regarding high-rise concrete construction and settled on this one. As I suspected, the information in this book does not represent how things are done in the US market. (NOTE: Bamboo scaffolding on page 305 and shirtless/shoeless workers on page 213). The portion of the 417 page book related to concrete frame construction is only 20 pages. The book is not entirely useless but covers all topics only very briefly."
2,tall buildings,"This books is mainly centred on work in asia,is poorly written and sometimes inconcise. I was looking for a book thatwould offer detailed info on general construction of highrise for the professional engineer, all i got was a book that might be of some little use for a first yearstudent in engineering. Altogether a bad choice"
2,Too bland and predictable,"I'm an American and I read the English translation of this novel. I'm sure you have to be a German to get a true feel for the context (Berlin and East Germany). It was obviously written for a German audience, so Hein leaves out details that could flesh things out for those of us who are unfamiliar with what it's like there.That becomes a problem when you consider that the book is intended to be satirical -- you have to be familiar with what the author is satirizing in order to get it. If you don't know what post-reunification Berlin and its middle class are like, ""Willenbrock"" will only give you the sketchiest hints.If you're a German or are very familiar with Germany, maybe you'll love it. If you're not, I can't recommend this book, as it reads rather bland and doesn't have enough to offer an international audience."
1,anonymous,the tape was advertised as new yet did not work. i really wanted to see this movie because it stars the great vincent price.
4,Best for Vincent Price fans,"This was filmed on an obviously very low budget and the special effects are not all that special but, with the ""monster"" being a demon, they could get away with it. Frankly, this film is not up to the standards of the films Vincent Price did for Roger Corman. Vincent Price gives a good performance as a good man driven to evil by the horla (the demon that possesses him) and Nancy Kovak is beautiful and pretty good too as his love interest. As for scary qualities, it will offer some suspense to Vincent Price fans, others looking to be terrified are likely to be disappointed. The promo line on the box about this being ""the most terrifying motion picture ever created"" is a long way from the truth, still it's a fun movie for Vincent Price fans."
3,MGM Limited Edition DVD-R - movies on demand,"This dvd-r is mastered from a decent print in the 1:66 to 1 screen ratio, with anamorphic enhancement. The Technicolor is fairly saturated but warmer (reddish) in tone than a more-accurate looking trailer, with is presented letterboxed at 1:85 to 1. The trailer is the only extra.The film itself has some sloppy pacing and a yammering screenplay, albeit one that Price can dig into with his particular brand of literate histrionics. The story tends to get sillier as it progress, and becomes downright silly as it closes, but it doesn't detract from the B-movie charms of this minor thriller. This should definitely please Price fans, and collectors should be satisfied with the presentation."
3,Decent Transfer of a Forgotten Film,"In a perfect world they would go back to the original film elements and make new transfers for these DVD-R MGM Limited Edition titles. That has apparently not happened with this title, though what's here isn't bad. The color fidelity is good, as is the contrast. There is noise in the picture, but I have seen worse. This is a decent looking, middle of the road, transfer. Don't expect a lot and you'll be pleased."
5,Diary Of A Madman,"One of Vincent Price's better horror films from the '60's era. A bit of a departure at the time from his slew of Poe films for Roger Corman, nice to see him playing a man possessed by an evil entity"
4,"Rock solid, but not really stackable","Product is a 1-level, 2"" riser for a monitor or other piece of desktop equipment. Enclosed on top and 3 sides, flat and smooth all around. Extremely sturdy. I needed 2 (1 for each of my 2 monitors) and they were exactly what I wanted. IMPORTANT NOTE: the picture shows them stacking, but they are not easily stackable. They do not have any notches, studs, etc. to keep them lined up, so if you stack them they can slide apart and fall if you bump the monitor. You will need double-stick tape all around the edges if you plan to stack them. If you just want them for 1 level, they are the most solid I'e ever seen."
4,Great riser,This is a great item to lift my monitor off the desk and get it at eye level. We use this product at all our computers in our office.
3,Nice table top book,"The focus of the book is the Smart model range. The presentation is great with excellent glossy pictures throughout. However there is little or nothing regarding technical or production aspects of the Smart range other than what you would find in any advertisement. I personally would have liked to see more behind the scenes information such as prototypes, crash tests and production facilities.So if you are looking for a Smart Car picture book then this fits the bill perfectly, if you are wanting a little more in-depth information you will be let down. A nice book for the coffee table and not expensive for the quality of presentation. It would make a nice gift for a proud Smart enthusiast."
2,set things straight,"first off this album is not worth 100 bucks. pay no more than 20, and thats if your a valor big valor fan because this album has live recordings of valor and rozz but more of valor singing rozz songs and valor totally trying to impersonate rozz's voice on every song. It's crazy hearing him try so hard to imitate rozz's voice on these live tracks. These live concerts with valor singing are cause appearently rozz just quite the band and did not go on tour with them to europe. The quality of the sound is very pour. You could bearly hear the music. Only the vocals are pretty much heard. And if your a rozz fan on one hand its cool cause you're gonna hear some live tracks of rozz but hate the album when you hear valor singing rozz songs. These tracks were recorded between roughly 1983- 1988.If your fans of both its an okay album to have but its not worth 100 bucks. I'm a fan of both and to me it's only worth 20 bucks. so don't be dumb and spend more than 20."
2,Not my cup of tea.,"Like Paul Whiteman, on this CD Bob Brookmeyer has made a lady out of jazz. Pretty writing, but solos are limited and restrained. If you want to hear a real woman, buy something else.Barry Rosenberg (barryrmusic.com)"
3,good but limited to pasta machines,"this is for pasta machines only, but the recipes can be translated to other past-forming methods."
3,A Youger Student's Guide to Latin,"This book is the second section of a two part book in the Ecce Romani series. This book text is more motivated to the reading and comprehension level of a youger reader. Each chapter starts with a story yet some chapters the stories have the same content. This book teaches you limited vocabulary and grammar a much needed part of learning latin. Towards the end of the book however the stories get more interesting with better sentence structure. It does however have many good points on Roman history, especially mythology. I liked the facts on Roman life though. This is a good book for a young Latin Scholar."
4,Fun Concept,"This figure has a neat concept with the trap wall. Kids may need help getting it to work though as the rope's a bit long. Still, a great gift for a Spider-Man fan."
4,SpiderMan,This was a birthday gift that arrived very quickly it great packaging. My Daughter enjoyed flying the kite. Thank you so much!
1,For women who want to be Stepford Wives,"This book was definitely not for me. I would have appreciated some biblical foundations on where some of these opinions of womanhood come from. Then, maybe would be open to receiving some advice on what materials I should or shouldn't wear to please my husband. I'm all for serving and respecting my husband, but I am not defined by that. I'm defined by who God says I am, not by how much my husband shows affection towards me and loves me. If you are going to put this book into your Spirit, please know that God loves you more than your husband could ever love you, and he will show you by faith in JESUS in the LIVING WORD of GOD (bible), how to love and honor your husband."
2,Fascinating womanhood pitfalls,"This book is a minefield for women, because it assumes men are so gullible that they will be taken in by a woman submerging her personality and becoming a ""Stepford wife"" bundle of smiling assent and praise. The principles that she advocates works on many men, but the woman using these principles will feel disappointed that the men do not appreciate them as individuals. There are other books that help women to nurture their marriages and relationships without advocating emotional slavery. I do not recommend this book!"
1,Looking for an easy way out?,"If you are tired of working at an adult relationship, buy this book. It is full of helpful tips on how to shrink yourself down to the right proportions for an insecure man who can't handle marriage to an intellingent, strong, grown-up woman. There is some good advice (on being loving, admiring, and accepting of your mate) all mixed up with a bunch of sexist, woman-hating (or is it woman-fearing?) nonsense. In the movie Pleasantville, there is a scene in which the mother, who has finally become ""real"" and is now in color, puts gray make-up on her face to try and fit back into her fake world. This is an excellent metaphor for what the author of this book is trying to get women to do. Please, women, forget this nonsense, and take the challenge to be ""real"" - a real man will appreciate you more, and take pride in your strength."
1,Frightening,The only thing more frightening than Andelin writing this book is the number of women who are still buying it. I can't believe such sexist ideas still exist in contemporary American society.
2,Just fascinating ....not.,"Fascinating Woman... I truly doubt if ""today's"" woman would appreciate this book. It has hints of Marabel Morgan's theory of ""how to make your marriage come alive"" in her book, ""The Total Woman"". The book is basically commonsense, with a twist of sensual tips and religion tones with suggestions on how to manipulate a man so you get what you want.My question is- why doesn't a man write a book on how to manipulate a woman?I probably would not recommend this book to anyone."
1,stupid book,it's not even worth the bother to repeat the balderdash in it. take my word for it and spend your money on something else.
1,Mormon propoganda garbage!,Teaching women to 'get their way with their man' through manipulative priciples while pretentending to be 'submissive.'
1,This book should be banned.,"I can't believe anybody would write a book like this. I wish I could give it even worse ratings. This book not only reveals a twisted view of the woman as a child-slave to the man, it also creates a selfish husband. Anyone who follows these guildlines is bound to go crazy from the self-denial."
1,"Would be repulsive in the 19th century, never mind the 21st","""Fascinating Womanhood"" is overwhelmingly popular among the followers of the Unification Church (i.e., the Moonies), who have said that this is a near-perfect depiction of how women should relate to men. You'd think THAT might clue in some of the women who've given this book five stars..."
4,It works!!!,"There are rough edges in my marriage before I read this book. ""Read with an OPEN MIND"" was what my friend suggest and I did just that.Do not misintrepret ""Child-like nature"" to being dumb and brainless. It meant being trusting and showing tremendous amount of support to encourage your better half to bloom.Since reading the book and quietly applying the suggestions within the book my marriage has been great! Your husband is human so treat him as such. Don't expect him to be SUPERMAN overnight. Just accept that he too can make mistake and trust that he will see it in his own time.My husband do not go out with his friends as often as before. Nor does he leave the house in moments of anger. I have learnt to accept that his silence is not anger or bear any reference to me what so ever. It is just how he is. Accepting this makes our marriage a breeze."
3,Dated But Helpful,"This book is one to glean insights from if the reader is willing to consider love as what one gives for the other's sake rather than what onegives in order to receive. It is written in hopes that, when implemented, the suggestions would encourage a reciprocally loving relationship. But it is clear that the suggestions cannot be effectively followed if not done in sincerity. It is a dated book in that the mindset seems to be very ""Father Knows Best"" like, but I am grateful for most of what's being said. I read the book out of a need to understand how to love my husband in a way in which he needs to be loved. I found the insights helpful as I realize that women and men really do have different needs. I would not, however, suggest this book for women in abusive realtionships or as a primary teaching tool for young women, because the author does not empower women to reject a man's abhorrent behavior."
2,Belittling to men but entertaining,"It's good for a marriage that a husband feels his wife is somehow different from himself, however, this book makes assumptions about what femininity is and what all men want which I think is not only demeaning to women but also demeaning to men. I'd like to think that a man today can appreciate a woman who is both feminine and his equal, perhaps even be attracted to her because she is in some ways better than he. This book was a response to the early days of the women's movement. But we're past that now and know we don't have to choose between being an individual and being feminine. If you want to know what fascinates Mr Andelin or what fascinated men of the 1960's, read this book. If you want to fascinate your husband, talk to him. (I gave it two stars for the entertainment factor.)"
4,Excellent,"Written in the same form as ""The Total Woman"" I found this book to be very enlightening. I learned much from the author and was not disappointed when I finished it. We need more books like this!"
1,So this is what ruined my mothers four marriages!,"A friend suggested this book, and I fell over when I recognized the cover. This was my MOTHERS book! She kept it on her nightstand.This explains everything. Her girlish child-like mannerisms. Her submissivness. Her infantile behavior. Her cooing and baby talk. She was following the advice in this book!Men would look at her sideways, as they tried to puzzle out if she was somehow joking or if she really was rock-stupid. Avoid this book like poisen. All it got her was four divorces. That's right, I said FOUR.They were all having affairs by the end of the first year. The second one moved out after only six months.Is there a way I can sue the author? I am traumatized victim of a broken home."
1,The 1950s frozen in time,"This is the perfect guidebook if you happen to married to Ward Cleaver and want to be more like June Cleaver. Should we call it ""historical fiction?"""
1,This book isn't very good,"Most of the ideas may have worked in the 60s, but not for today's modern husband. I don't think modern men would be attracted to the play acting, childish acting women that the book is advocating. They actually like stronger, career minded women and look down upon the ""little, helpless acting housewife.""They appreciate a woman who can bring some money into the household and relieve them of the stress of all that responsiblity. It also costs a lot more to live now than in the 60s too. Having a helpless acting woman gets really old and it makes the woman look really stupid when she ventures out into the real world, yet acts and looks like a helpless child. I think a modern husband would be embarrassed to be seen with such a woman. I do agree however with some points, like encouraging your husband, etc. But that is how we all should be with everyone."
1,Condenscending,"I wish I could give this text zero stars, because this was one of the most appalling books I have read. Everything from the patronizing manner it was written to the incredulous reinterpetation of Tolstoy's marriage - I felt frustrated reading this book in part due to the author writing as if her audience was ten years old.One of the biggest issues my grandmother faced after my grandfathers death was that she had no idea how to take care of herself. Maybe some men would like the traditional wife, but if he dies or leaves then the woman is completely vulnerable. I think it is naive and arrogant to not learn how to be an independent woman, especially in this day and age. It is a travesty that there are still women who still read this and believe that in order to be loved, they must show how weak they are."
3,Gotta be pragmatic...,"Sure, it has MANY shortcomings, it is the Stepford wife handbook...but the fact of the matter is this: in a marriage, ideally, each partner would continually be working on diminishing his/her own behaviors that cause disharmony, and ignoring his/her spouse's faults. Ideally, men and women would do this equally. In the real world, this will never happen. How many MEN do you picture reading a book about how to make their WIFE feel happy and loved? I checked...there are 100 reviews of ""Fascinating Womanhood"", and of ""Man of Steel and Velvet"", the man's version...nine reviews.Give up on feminism--life's not fair and it's never going to be. You don't have to get married, but if you decide you want to, you as the woman are going to have to make it work, all on your own, if you can. Men just aren't interested.Now, you want to write a book for men on how they can convince every barely-legal beautiful girl they think they deserve, to have sex with them--then you'll have a best-seller!"
1,Are you brain dead? Then this is the book for you.,"I found this book to be very racist and disturbing. It would be funny if not for the women that actually take this to be gospel. The racism is throughout the book it is very obvious this is intended for upper class white women, and there are direct racist remarks. I found the advice that wives should be ""childlike"" to be very disturbing. Any man who takes to this is looking more for the child than the wife. I think the author thinks that adult humans are quite stupid and need to lie and manipulate each other in order to have a good marriage.If you are married in an honest and loving relationship with your husband and he likes you for your intelligence and maturity then this is not the book for you. This book is not about feminism or feminity it is a book that advocates an unequal union and manipulation as a way to get what you want. It degrades both men and women."
1,"It's funny, and a little sad and frightening","I have no doubt that if a woman adopts the practices outlined in this book that she might be more successful with the typical male... but it's sickening to me that a woman should have to stoop to that level. When are we going to start expecting more out of men? When is society going to stop making women feel they have to bend over backwards to cater to the big bawling babies they are married to in order to keep the domestic peace?Rubbish. Good for an incredulous laugh, but that's about it."
5,"I, too bought it for the ""wrong"" reasons",I picked this up used for [price] and what a steal! This is hilarious! A great conversation piece.
1,Should be rated zero,"This is a frightening book. The frightening thing is that women will read this and actually try to follow the suggestions. I am appalled that the writer suggests that women should act like children when they are angry with their husbands because it is cute. I am even more appalled at the writer's suggestions of how to handle an abusive husband. In my opinion, the writer implies that it is the fault of the wife when the husband is being abusive. This is 100 steps backward for educating women about domestic violence. The writer should be ashamed of what she has written. She should be more ashamed that she represents her ideas as Christian. My KJV Bible does not indicate that a husband should slap his wife around no matter how she acts!!! I only hope that a woman who is being abused will seek counsel somewhere other than this book!"
2,The system didn't work in the long haul,"I first read this book in my teens, twenty-five years ago. I thought it was wonderful and I based a large part of my life and who I was on its instructions. It worked to some extent - people told me I was very feminine. Well, being feminine didn't do me much good. Here I am, twenty-five years later, with a husband who refuses to work or be a father to his children. I am the family's breadwinner and the children's guide and disciplinarian. My husband lives at home like a overgrown teenager who lets Mom bear all the responsibilities. I feel like I've been duped. I based my life on system that didn't deliver for me."
1,DH and I have a great relationship... because I avoided this book,"My husband and I have a great relationship and he openly says there's no way he'd be interested in someone who had to follow these horrific rules in order to ""manage"" him. What is good about a relationship where you have to act like someone else to make him happy?! That should scare the crap out of you. Get out of the relationship or don't get into one until you know what you want. Horrific--though it would be ""fascinating"" for a psychological study of the nutty."
4,This book is helpful in some ways,"I don't agree with most of the advice regarding marriage in this book, but the lady does know how to keep a clean and orderly home. This book changed my life in that way. I followed the housekeeping advice and am much happier, organized and more capable of handling whatever life throws at me because my home is in order."
1,Enforcing the gender dichotomy,It sickens me that this book has received so many positive reviews. A womyn betrays humanity and feminism by telling females to make themselves feel small and worthless for the sake of men (as if decent men are attracted to silent mice and blowup dolls) ... and we praise her for it.
1,Are you kidding me?!,"This drivel sets back women's rights and the feminist movement by four decades. I pity any woman who might actually use this as guide for ""keeping her husband interested."""
3,Interesting,"This book is interesting,but I was disappointed that the author didn't use a lot of scripture to back up what appears to be her own opinion. Also, this was originaly published in the 1960's and seems a bit dated."
5,"Married 55+ years, she must have known something!","Helen Andelin was married for over 55 years before loosing her husband. I'd say with todays divorce rate, that we could all learn a little something from this book. I don't think everyone needs to follow ever suggestion she makes, but I think everyone could find something of benefit. Making a life with the man I love is my number one priority and if I have to make a few sacrifices here and there, it is only because I know he is doing the same for me...perhaps that is why we are still married (happily)4 children and 18 years later."
5,Wonderful book,"This is a wonderful book to improve one's marriage, or to strengthen it. It shows women how to be content with their marriage and to love their husband. it goes back to basic bible principles (Proverbs woman, anyone?)to show what we women how to properly behave and treat our husbands.People have argued that this book tells you not to be yourself. That may be, but probably means their characters NEED changing, and they don't want to go though the effort of fixing that.Great book!"
5,Every mature woman should read!,"I was recommended this book years ago. If you do not get ""hung up"" on the religious ideals and apply it to current day with an open mind, as suggested many times, it's extremely powerful for EVERYONE.It's not a guarantee for every man, because not every man is going to be right for you.I do not recommend this as reading for someone too young either. Its insight is much easier to see and apply after you've had some experience with grown men in at least dating.Read with an open mind and ENJOY."
5,What every woman should know,"This review isn't written by Vernon, it's actually written by his wife. Great book. This book has saved my parents marriage MANY years ago. It really is something every woman should know. It helps bring women in touch with themselves and everything else just falls into place."
1,Worst book for women,This is one of the worst books. It is all about manipulation and how to lie to get what you want. It is cloaked in a dirty robe of religion. God never asked us to manipulate people to get what we want. To act childish to get a man to love you is to have a man who never grew up himself. This writer is dysfunctional and so are the men she writes about.I was raised on this book by my Christian school. It did more damage to me than I can say in this short review. The big keys are obedience & submission. Both are not godly end all be all qualities. Sometimes the godly thing is to stand up to your man and defend your child or someone else. Sometimes you have to stand up for yourself so that you are not abused. This book sets you up so that other people will run all over and abuse you. I can't say that enough.Follow it to your own peril.
5,hanging the dixie cup dispenser upside down,I like the part where she recommends the wife purposely act helpless and do things wrong so that the man can come in and rescue her. That always makes a man feel good.
1,Are your brain dead? Is your husband a racist and pedophile?,"This book would be funny if not for the many women living these words. I found this book racist (extremely) and promoting ideas that lend themselves to pedophiles. If your husband likes to have you act ""childish"" then you have more problems than you know. Any man that would want a childlike wife does not want a wife but rather the child. Quite scary. If you need to learn how to lie and manipulate to have a happy marriage, then your problems started on the wedding night.If you have married into a union and have a true marriage partner that loves and respects you, then you don't need this book!If you feel your daughters are only worth what this book is promoting, and you run your marriage by this book, maybe you need to get off your couch and onto a psychiatrists couch. I believe civil rights have taken a backseat here."
2,a facinating relic,"From the standpoint of a woman 25 years old, this book reads like something out of the far past;similar to Victorian and Edwardian ettiquette manuals. The book is interesting to read, though most of the advice sound outdated and just plain bad. Still, it is a very funny book in some places where it intended no humor."
4,Fascinating Indeed!,"I was a bit skeptical when I read about this book, and laughed at some of the ideas. But I was drawn in. I haven't applied everything, as some of it is a bit outdated. But I have been working on using the character principals, and it has worked wonders! I am not turning into a doormat for anyone, but giving a little respect to our husbands never hurts!"
5,Very comfortable shoe. Runs close to shoe size!,Very comfortable shoe. Runs very close to shoe size! I needed a shoe for an upcoming show and even beginners can use this shoe.
1,BEWARE!,"I bought this shoe for use working in a theatre. After a few months I had to have it re-heeled, and then shortly after the heel broke right off, causing me to fall down the stairs. I'd beware of this shoe, not made well at all."
3,Painful,"I bought these as character shoes for opera performance. They are very uncomfortable for now and I cannot wear them more than an hour without swearing, but all the singers I work with tell me that once you wear them for a while, they become very comfortable..."
2,Wide? NOT,"I really need character shoes for a professional production I am going to be in shortly. I have extra wide feet, so I was hoping these would be wide. They were NOT at all. Maybe a medium width, but more like narrow. Too bad. I wish I could find shoes that work. I am supposed to be a professional theatre actress, but won't look like one without the proper shoes."
3,very cute!,I liked these shoes....they were very cute! But I had to return them only because my class offered us free shoes....or else I would have kept these. I'm giving them 3 stars because I did not like the return process. They made me pay for shipping when I returned them back to them.
3,"Not Badger, but still good","Selling this album with the Badger moniker was definitely false advertising. I was very disappointed when I first bought it in 1974. But, I listened to it often enough to learn to like it... a lot. Now, I think it's the better ""Badger"" album -- when in the mood to hear something like Little Feat."
1,Creative Labs Sound Blaster Live! LS 5.1 SB0229,"This is the worst card i ever had, software does not work, drivers are even worse, i am switching back to my old card this is junk, there is no driver/sofware updates to fix these problems, Shame On Creative Labs!"
1,"Boring, Boring, Boring!","The by line for the book should credit Plato, Socrates, Aristotle and their colleagues. The most writing done by Minton or Shipka is the brief introductory paragraph (or sometimes sentence) before each essay written by great philosophers. The book has it's uses in entry-level courses but considering the average reader is a college student whose attention span is limited if the material is not provocative to read, the text's usefulness is greatly reduced. College professors, pass this one up."
2,poor quality,"This should come with an bungee string because the regular string doesn't keep it cinched well enough around the tire, also the string holding clamp mechanism is small and cheap and it was already broken when I received the item so I had to pull the string out and insert a long bungee cord through the hole so it will stay on the tire now."
4,Worth reading,I'm 15 and I found this book a bit too young for me but I liked it very much. I read it at one sitting because I could not put it down. The first part of the book is just one incident after the other and you don't know what the story is all about. But half way through things are gradually explained and the plot becomes more and more interesting. I kept reading faster and faster because I wanted to know what happens next. The ending was a clever surprise. Sorry I'm not giving you any hints because I don't want to spoil it for you. The book reads clearly and smoothly and I'm sure you will love the characters who are very well presented. My favorite one was the talking mouse because he's so funny in trying to be brave. I hope this review will help other people to decide whether they wish to read this book or not. I'd say it's worth it.
3,2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Heathers has acquired a considerable cult following, (no doubt in appreciation of its dark tone) but the movie is very dated and its third act, in which the movie compromises its iconoclastic values, torpedoes the film."
1,"Wow, I read it was well loved and dark plus funny. It wasn't.","I almost made it to 1:18 before I decided to review it as a flop. It's a role reversal film, where the kids are infinitely smarter than the adults. People make horrible decisions w/o repercussion. IDK how it ends and I don't care. After waiting for it to get better, I thought I'd warn others there's little humor and like most movies, the characters aren't very deep. Are there any redeeming aspects? Nope, no car chases, nor any chase scenes to cut to, no gratuitous sex, the violence isn't satisfying, and I didn't care enough about the characters to finish it. I guess if you like 80s styles, that's one redeeming aspect, but that's all. There are many things entertaining in this world, but this isn't one of them."
3,Blu-Ray could be better,"I still love the movie. It's just as good as the first time I saw it back in the 80's. I think it has held up well over the years. This Blu-ray, however, could've been better. I was surprised to see that there weren't any special features, not even deleted scenes or a trailer. Nothing. Would have been nice to see some interviews with the cast or something. If you already have the DVD it's good enough. Don't bother to upgrade on this one."
5,Heathers,Fast Shipping!! Great item. What a movie. Afer all these years they are still selling this movie. I grew up watching this movie and its pretty good.
2,This tape is recorded in SLP mode,"i ordered the ""collectors edition"" and was quite disappointed to find out it was recorded in SLP mode. Even worse, this fact was not disclosed anywhere on the case or on the tape cartridge itself. i don't know why tape duplication companies have to cut corners so cheaply considering the very low cost of videotape in the last 15 years. SLP mode seriously reduced this tape quality. I definitely will not order any more tapes from Anchor Bay entertainment."
4,One of favorites,Heathers has to be one of the funniest teen movies ever made. Wionna Ryder made a carrer makig movie in the lead role as Veroncia. Christan Slater proved he was the next Jack Nicholson in his role as JD. And all of the Heathers are hilarous with their one liners. Check it out
5,How very.,"Heathers is absolutely fantastic. It portrays teen life to a T and it does a great job of mocking it. The main character, Veronica (played by Winona Ryder), makes me feel like she's duplicating my life and every other teenager's life. The gorgeous Christian Slater plays the mysterious newcomer, JD. It doesn't even matter how awesome he was in the movie (though he was pretty awesome), he's just a nice peice of eye candy. It's a very relatable film and I think everyone should see it."
5,Heathers is a worthwhile classic,"Although the movie looks a little dated, Heathers is a quirky fun film full of angst. A great buy for the price."
5,The Best Black Comedy in Ages,"Winona Ryders gives the best performance of her career as Veronica, the only member of a powerful high-school clique not named Heather. Christian Slater plays J.D., the new kid in town who is a rebel with a cause. Together, they go on a killing spree, eliminating the most popular kids at school, only seeing their plans backfire, when the most hated kids at school become the most-loved. Slater does a wicked Jack Nicholson performance, and the scripts wit and slang only help this film to become a true classic."
5,trippy movie,"What a change. I know this is an old movie, but I've never seen a teen movie that is about teens dying and two teens making it seem like it was suicide. I enjoyed it, I thought it was funny on some parts and entertaining. Good movie!!!!"
5,hilarious,"I really only have one thing to say and that is Cristian Slater was HOT in this movie. Well that is for a phycho-killer-stalker-kinda-guy. This movie is great, the lingo is hilarious (""what's your damage,"" or, my personal favorite, ""how very""). But I do think that this movie is a bit over the wall. Don't watch it expecting it to be right on the money. For example, the police just accepted the jock's double suicide?? I would have been a little suspetious. But hey that's me."
1,DEFECTIVE DVD,"The movie is a classic, but I have exchanged this DVD 5 times , and it still doesn't play properly. I have tested it out on 4 different players. I noticed that several other reviews complained about the same thing. Go to anchorbayentertainment.com, and on ""Questions"" or ""Suggestions"", please politely ask them to do a recall. If enough of us complain, this will be corrected."
5,Movies that DON'T SUCK,"The transfer and audio on this DVD are acceptable, haven't managed to watch any of the DVD extras, but screened this movie for several people who haven't seen it in ages, and some people who hadn't been born yet when the movie came out... everyone agrees, this movie doesn't suck!A classic movie, it had a huge influence on many movies that came later and a pop culture phenomenon... A must see if you like watching movies.""Eskimo"""
3,Good,"Heathers is a cult film. With its dark comic-edge and outrageous genuine odd characters. The performances are excellent. Actress, Winona Ryder gives great depth as a high school girl(Veronica Sawyer) that searches for a place among the cool crowd, which is exhibited by a group of snob/teenage girls. Through a turn of cruel events, she becomes her own social strata, along with the aide of her boyfriend. Actor, Christan Slater's bizarre commanding character, has his own levels of complex, strange problems, which set up to the climax of this film. This film begins with fresh, new, interesting ideas and becomes uneven after a certain key point in the film. But the outrageous premise stands through to the end. This film is not for all tastes. PLEASE SEE MY OTHER REVIEWS."
5,Twisty,"I remember watching this years ago. I'm not a huge fan of Wynona but it was a twisty type movie that I didn't expect. It's the brutal parent to 'mean girls', but very dark. Considering the Columbine type content, I'm surprised it hasn't been banned. It's an 80's shocker, kind of Fight Club-esque."
4,Good Movie,"I remember watching this movie a few years back. I thought it was decent overall. But my biggest question is if Jason hated the world so much, why didn't he blow himself up inside the gym?"
2,Bad 80s Movie,"I watched this at my girlfriend's insistance and being a fan of 80s movies I was optimistic. However, I just did not like this movie. The plot, while it had potential, was just lame and I don't think Christian Slater, Winona Rider, and the rest of the cast could have done a worse job acting. Still this movie has achieved cult status and many people, as you can tell from the other reviews, love this movie. This movie was not for me."
5,loved it!!,"never saw the movie before I bought it..but it was a good deal so I bought it...watch it...annnnd loved it...I highly recommend it. But, if you are looking for the mean girls kind of movie that this is rumored to be like...then this isn't for you..but I think it is better"
4,LIFE ON THE DARK SIDE,Heathers is pentultium dark comedy. Winona and Christain found chemistry on and off the screen in this sauvy commentary on teen culture. The dialogue here is first rate--many quotes that will stick with you. And if you are a Christain Slater fan (as I am) this will be one of your favs. He is a young stud here--full of hubris and doing his best Jack Nickolson. The ending is a hoot--my favorite scene. Don't miss this underground classic.
5,Heathers is great!,"This movie is awesome! It's such a classic in that without it, many movies would not have been thought of and made."
3,Ryder - Mystery Solved,"I used to wonder why we didn't see Ryder anymore. Now that I've seen this movie for the first time, I'm sure I now know."
4,Just as crazy as I remember!,This was great! Just like I remember watching in high school. Strip crochet?!? Who knew it could be so much fun?
3,What's My Damage?,"This movie didn't age well. It looks like they filmed it really cheaply, with bad lighting and camera angles. I liked it better when I saw it in high school. There are some funny parts but alot of the jokes are stale and fall flat. It does have a good underlying meassage though. Serial Kill bullies?"
4,pretty darned good,"Only a couple thoughts: the only reason anyone still takes Nona Ryder seriously is this movie. Virtually everything else she has been in has either been forgettable or an embarrassment. For that, and to see why an entire generation of young talented actors have proposed to her, you should see the movie.And, it can't be avoided. This is the trenchcoat mafia in the movies. It's such a good film, such an amazingly good film, and yet its legacy is pretty undeniably Columbine. Destruction for its own sake. The joke isn't, alas, as funny as it was."
1,Worst movie I've ever seen...,"Call this review unhelpful if you wish...but it is very easy to summarize this film. It is BY FAR the WORST movie I have ever seen. In every way this movie is terrible - script, cast, directing, editing, soundtrack. It is offensive, poorly acted, stupid and Christian Slater is ungodly bad (does Amazon let you swear, because f---ing piece of s--- is the more appropriate title of this film). If you buy this movie, you are just plain stupid. Sorry, but it is that bad. And I don't feel like I will ever have to defend my rating - if you trust the people on Amazon that have given this flick (dump) 4-5 stars, that's your own fault. Don't say I didn't warn you. And if you do like the film, I can send you a movie of my dog taking a c--- for $3 instead.Cult classic my f---ing a--. If this is a cult classic, pass me the magic Kool-aid!"
4,The Italian Baker,"The book was not portrayed accurately. It was portraryed as being ""like new"" and I feel that I paid a ""like new"" price. However the bottom on the page edges are marked with an obvious, intentional black mark. I am familiar with the book and wanted it in my collection; it is the retailer I am not happy with not the book."
5,My favorite bread recipes come from this book,"I checked this book out so many times my husband finally got the hint and bought it for me five years ago. A wonderfully written book with fabulous recipes. Here are our favorites: Focaccia (any), Pizza (any), Panforte (this is better than the stuff you buy in Siena. I could eat the whole thing), Panettone (easy, light, wonderful), Raisin Rosemary rolls, the Rosemary bread (I've made this many, many times and it is unbeatable--gorgeous and delicious), the little herb rolls, the ciabatta, the breadsticks (so so easy and terrific), and I can't remember what else. Oh, several cookie recipes, and the incredible, incredible tarts with pasta frolla (rice tart....). And on and on. Highly, highly recommended. Six stars if I could."
5,SCRUMPTIOUS,EXCELLENT PHOTOS AND SCRUMMY RECIPES!!! A must have for all of you home bakers!!! Excellent breads!!!
5,A book every baker should own,"If you are a novice or veteran baker. You should own this book! It covers every way you can make a loaf of bread, by hand, food proccesser or mixer. It covers it all. My favorite is ""Pane di Como"" on page 102."
5,The Italian Baker,"I love the book. The recipes are right on, and everything I have tried so far tastes great. My seller was also great to work with. Everything was delivered as promised."
3,Solo quiero traducirlo idiotas. Tengo prueba de este libro!,"He intentado de todas las formas poder leer este libro en espa√±ol y no lo consigo, por favor si alguna mente piadosa que pueda enviarmelo traducido al espa√±ol, ser√© su m√°s ferviente disc√≠pulo. bye."
4,The Myth of Osteoporosis,"The book gave me a very good insight in bone health. I was dianosed with osteopenia,I was terrified so I got on the web and startd searching and I found a couple of books to read and this being the first I read. It put my mind at ease.Its not a disease,its natural.The Doctors wanted me on these drugs I am not going on drugs if I don't have to. So you change your diet and exercise.I recommend this book .Thank you author,Gillian Sanson"
3,Myth exposed.,"I liked the advice of this book. Taking calcium and some of the more traditional ways is really not that effective. Balance your hormones, do weight bearing exercise. I think the most important things I took from this was that DEXA scans are calibrated differently and results vary. That osteoporosis as a 'disease' is a money maker just like cancer."
4,The Myth of Osteoporosis,"The book is well-written, informative and has an excellent presentation style. It is quite up-to-date."
3,re not the book to buy if you already have severe osteoporosis,"I was a bit disappointed with the book. I don't recommend buying this book if you already have severe osteoporosis. There is nothing in it which will help you. I think its more for the average person out there is has osteopenia (early osteoporosis). Strong Women, Strong Bones is a better bet for those who already have a diagnosis of osteoporosis."
5,A Must Read,"This book is very interesting and informative. Anyone diagnosed with osteoporosis should read it. It will give you another perspective and a balance to the information you may have received about osteoporosis. This is important in helping you make decisions on what to do as a result of the diagnosis.The author and her family have been diagnosed with osteoporsis, so she write from experience and lots and lots of personal research."
1,No fun for any age,This is the worst toy that my son received for his 5th birthday. Making a basket is nearly impossible for me or him. There is no scoring mechanism. This toy is going in the garbage.
3,Not Like New!,"Advertised as ""Like New Condition"" but the CD was dirty and had many scratches and did not play until I washed it.I guess it was the condition of the case that put it in the ""Like New"" catigory.This is the first and last used item I will ever buy."
5,Great for Fans & Collectors,"When I saw this in my local bookstore I had to have it. It includes a very nice mix of covers from the various Nancy Drew eras and the color clarity is terrific. This will make a wonderful addition to my collection. --Karen P., author, Nancy Drew Scrapbook"
5,A MUST for fans of Nancy Drew!,These are so awesome that I bought them only to find out that I could not make myself mail them out to people. I ended up keeping them all for myself!Each card is the perfect replica of one of the early original Nancy Drew books that I grew up with.Perfect as a gift for a young one who is currently reading Nancy Drew or for adults who treasured each story as they hit the book shelves. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
2,Kind of difficult,"I got this before they came out with Wii Fit. I liked the idea of dancing away the fat. I don't like to waste money going to the gym, and I'd rather workout at home. I could not get the steps. It was going way to fast and I didn't have the patience to do it in slow motion, over and over. I think joining a class or trying the wii fit would be more successful!"
2,Not what I had hoped for...,"I agree with a previous reviewer that the women in the back of this video are a bit lead-footed.The thing I found the most jarring about this workout is that the speed at which the instructor wants you to do the workout has nothing to do with the music they're playing. I felt that if this is to be a ""dance"" workout, that the music should be on beat with the speed of the ""Dance"" that you're learning.Don't get me wrong, it will make you sweat - and it's a decent workout. But - I was disappointed with the dancing (I thought it wasn't faithful enough to real Hip Hop dancing. It was almost an outsider's look at Hip Hop, as though the instructor were ""classically"" trained in dancing, but had no real taste for the flavor of the style), and disappointed with the dancers trio not wanting to stay on the beat with the music that was playing. If you don't have an ear for rhythm, this probably won't bother you, but I have no intentions of keeping or doing this workout again."
3,Harry's War - Revised Edition,"I was excited when the movie was finally re-released. I had to watch it twice to figure out what was wrong. Several chunks were hacked out leaving logical gaps in the action. It's only 98 minutes, why the editing? There was nothing objectionable with the original ----- Why?"
5,Banned by the IRS?,"This movie has an interesting history. I first saw it in the early 80s on HBO but in later years, it simply disappeared. I went to a video rental place and they tried to look it up in their master catalog and it just wasn't there. I always thought it very suspicious that a great movie with top name stars just ceased to exist for over twenty years. I always figured the IRS threatened to audit the owners or something, but who knows?The ending of the movie turned out to be eerily similar to later events in Waco, TX.Anyway, it's a great, family-oriented movie. I give it five stars."
4,"Magick Brothers - 'Live At The Witchwood,1991' (Voiceprint)","Apparently a one-time side project for Gong main man Daevid Allen.'Live At...' is basically good trippy 'head' music.Plenty of that Allen type of wit that many of us have come to expect.Eleven tracks with a duration of 73:10.Some exclusive cuts to this disc as well as several Gong obscurities,like ""Zero Theme"",""Magick Brothers""(off the very first Gong lp of the same name)and the 12-minute ""Wise Man In Your Heart"".Also some Allen solo material ""I Am My Own Roadie"" and ""Trial By Headline"".Line-up:Daevid Allen-guitar&vocals,Graham Clarke-violin and Mark Robson-keyboards&digeridoo.A should-have."
3,Nasa meets the x-files,"What do you do when an American astronaut is murdered aboard the International Space Station? If you're Nasa, you go find an ex-astronaut turned drunken, burnt out cop and ship him up on the next shuttle mission to figure out who the bad guy is.Around page 100, I really had my doubts about this book. I didn't find the main character ""Edge"" Reynolds particularily engaging, and I feared another ""Nasa"" book would get bogged down in acronym-laced prose.When the murder is ""solved"" around page 200 and there is a good chunk of the book left to read, I decided to stick with it. Without creating a spoiler, I found the solution to the mystery rather ingenius. It was the kind of stuff the X-files had going for it in the the later seasons.Considering how fragile the technology really is, I think this book's shuttle and space station are far more durable than real life, but it makes for good read on the beach."
3,Orbital corpses,"I read this a couple of years ago when first released in Australia. Ex-astronaut turned cop ""Edge"" Reynolds is sent up to the ISS to investigate a murder, and it turns out that those sneaky Russians have a Big Secret. A lot of astronauts and cosmonauts get killed, and there are not one but TWO zero-g autopsies. Worth reading for these, but I found Edge (from whose point of view the story is told) to be one of the most irritating characters I have ever come across (think ""Ugly American""). I kept hoping he would get killed; unfortunately not. He seems to have a miraculous ability to survive all sorts of disasters. Very patronizing towards the Russian space program (if anyone from there happens to read it they will be seriously [upset]). The author also confuses the suburb of Korolev with Star City (both are in different places). It's an okay read - some interesting ideas - but I really, really hate Edge (and NASA in general)."
5,Invaluable insights into the mind of adopted children,"Harlow's work demonstrates the importance of caregiving and companionship in social and cognitive development. His work influenced key changes in how orphanages, adoption agencies, social services groups, and child care providers approached the care of children. Along with child analysts and researchers, including Anna Freud and Ren√© Spitz, Harlow's experiments added scientific legitimacy to two powerful arguments: against institutional child care and in favor of psychological parenthood. The permanence associated with adoption was far superior to other arrangements when it came to safeguarding the future mental and emotional well-being of children in need of parents. His themes are evident in the book Adoption Detective by Judith and Martin Land. Reference: Page 273-274Judith Land, AuthorAdoption Detective: Memoir of an Adopted Child"
2,useless purchase!,"Before purchasing, the work book I put in the name dos mundos seventh edition. The book appeared, and I purchased it! When the book arrived it was in excellent condition, but the wrong edition! They sent the sixth edition! I was in the process of writing finals, and the book couldn't be used not even for review purposes! I contacted the seller telling him I planned to return the book, for a refund because I'm unable to use the book! He responded that I had the book for a few weeks and could not be refunded! Now I have a new book for which I have no use for! This seller, rykytran is greedy and unfair, he didn't suggest sending me returning the 6th edition for the 7th edition! Neither is he willing to refund me, when I have no use for the book! He needs to have a refund policy, if he wants to be selling items on the web! The seller is a nasty individual!"
3,Product information,"I noticed the sole review of this item from 4/04 and found, I think, a place to get the info the reviewer wanted... :)""For additional information on DBK kitchenware products, please contact Heather Schall, Marketing Director, Lifetime Hoan Corporation 516.683.6000 X226 or at heathers@lifetime.hoan.com.""Hope this may be helpful."
3,"A Study, not a translation","I purchased this book thinking I was buying a translation of 'The Gospel of Nicodemus' primarily as I was looking for the 'Acts of Pilate'. But alas this is a doctoral study into the work. I have yet to find between its pages a straight translation. Admittedly, after reading significant sections I now realise that a straight translation is by no means a small task as every culture seems to have developed their own versions for either innocent or calculating reasons.It is therefore the apparent purpose of this book to examine the history, context, and causes for the development and change to this psudo gospel. Yet you will however find sections of translation relevant to the discussion at hand.If you want a straight translation to sit down and read, give this volume a miss. But if you are wondering why I have rated this work with three stars, it is because its quality is not to be underestimated making this book an authority on the subject."
4,(not quite) too cute for their own good,"With their retro fashion statement and girl-power solidarity, it would be hard to blame anyone for thinking of The Pipettes as a sort of Spice Girls for the Indie Rock set. However, beyond the visuals lies a pretty darn solid girl group revival band record. While not as Garagy as say, Ko and the Knockouts or The Downbeat 5 , the backing band is just tough enough to put a little bite behind the tunes and what groovy tunes they are. Whatever these gals' sugary-sweet confections lack in substance, they more than make up for in catchy hooks. Best of all is ""Pull Shapes"" with its mega ""Dance With Me Chorus"" backed by trilling strings and prominent hand claps. Its one of the most fun singles of the year and the rest of the album's 35 minutes is nearly enjoyable."
5,Not Many As truly talented!,"A great DVD Funny,It will make you laugh till you cry it has Look awards show,Freddie and the spies ,Freddie and the da Vinchi,Red and the big mouth,CAPTURING THE kILLER AND MUCH MORE IT IS REALLY GREAT!"
3,"Factual, if not thrilling","I must confess, I read this book to fulfill an assignment for an MBA class. I didn't expect to find it at all interesting, but it was. I had no experience with labor unions up until this point, and it was interesting to find out just who is in charge.This book is well researched and full of factual information-- too much information for me to absorb effectively. I was expecting it ro read more like a novel than a history book, but I did find certain parts interesting nonetheless.If you want to find out how the Teamsters rose to power and how the Mafia eventually fell out of control of the Teamsters, read this book."
4,Mobbed Up,I ordered the book for my brother and he said it was received as expected. We questioned why anyone would sell a book for 1 cent. Why bother? Anyway we would purchase from them again.
1,Bad website,"You have got to be one of the most difficult websites to navigate, and the most difficult to find how to contact a person with which to discuss a problem ordering!"
5,Great Love songs,"Esp. the song classic has the most addictable lyrics and the music. When i was 18, it effect me too much and grow to love slow songs. Thank You Gurvitz.Maby a bit old but beleive me if you like to be slow mood; just wonderfull with a glass of whine and ..."
1,No!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Sorry, but 'Classic' simply has to be the worst song I have evr heard. Indeed I tell my children so. It's paper thin tune is overlayed by what must be the worst lyrics on disc. 'Gonna write a classic, gonna write it in an attic, babe I'm an addict now, an addict for your love. Enopugh said? Not quite. How did this get onto vynal. More, how did it get onto CD."
3,Vintage Hollywood cowboy music,"I bought this CD for Roy Roger's anthem ""Hoppy, Gene and Me"" which I had wanted ever since accidentally hearing it on the radio. Some of the other songs by lesser-known performers are a little dated and hokey. I found one song, ""Don't Go Near the Indians"", to be racially offensive and I don't think it should have been included."
5,America's Embarrassment . . . . Where were you?,"Spike Lee has struck a cord in this classic work. Poignant portrayals of racism in 1964 as 4 Little Girls are brutally murdered in the Birmingham church bombing by the KKK. I was 4 years old living in an all white community in rural Ohio. I didn't even know these things were happening and I am embarrassed and outraged at the ignorance and stupidity of those involved. The scars the community and a nation carried from that moment on will last a lifetime for those who lived and relived the beautiful memories and the horror of the deadly event in the interviews provided in this documentary. The pain, sorrow and powerful message will affect the lives of anyone who views this picture. This should be required viewing for all school aged children so we can work to eliminate hatred and encourage a celebration of diversity in America."
5,Very moving; Powerful,"This is one of the saddest, most gripping documentaries i have ever seen. Four little girls is about the death of four young black girls who died in a KKK church bombing in birmingham, alabama and about racism & segregation. Though not a thriller, it will keep you on the edge of your seat for its entirety. Sympathy, empathy, tears, anger...you name it, and you'll feel it while viewing this film.The personal interviews are powerful beyond words, and the interviewed can relate to anyone, causing even more empathy. Once you reach the end, after the interviews (of the good and the bad), the autopsy shots and other images, plus effective music, that's it. You feel like you could start a revolt against racism and segregation. This could move a racist or any member of a hateful clan. Experience this movie."
1,4 Little Girls,"I brought it as a follow up to the book ""The Watsons Go To Birmingham"" about a fictional family whose sister was at the church at the time of the bombing but escaped unharm. The movie was not appropiate for 11 - 13 years old. It was too graphic and too many details."
5,Under my Purple Ascot Beats a Heart that Bleeds,"This is delicious pop, heartbreaking relationship music. The opening answering machine sample is a heartbreaker. The album rules. Gentle sounds that tear your heart and lift your soul. You'll hate the lyrics 'cause you'll have to clean the tears off your ascot. ""Comedienne"" is great. ""Me Next"" is lounge cool. The rest is apple pie."
4,useful suggestions,"I read this a couple weeks ago. SOme paragraphs, I totally skim read since they were LOONG example stories, and sale pitches for the author's seminars... but I've begun to relate in a different way with the men I meet-date-know and I totally like this new and honest approach, it does simplify things and eases up on any after the date guilt that I may feel if I don't necessarily find the man atractive or a match for me. I recommend this book."
3,Met the need,"When placing this order, it does not mention in the product description if the patch is clear or of color. The patch is beige. My husband wears them, is happy with them, but prefers the clear patch. It would be nice if a clear patch, quantity of 14 or more by this same company would become available."
4,I might be allergic,Worked very good but was very irritating to my skin no matter where I placed the patch. I have sensitive skin so it might just be me but it did make my skin itchy and red.
1,headache maker,"this product gives me a massive headache. if your choosing between name brand and this avoid this product all together. I am usually not sensitive to it, but this one is not a good substitute."
3,Not a total solution,"They make it sound as though it solves the problem but I think it only helps say 40%, the rest is up to you ! better than depending 100% on yourself though !!"
1,BEWARE ONLY FOR PSP-1000,"I did not know that this product was only for PSP 100, due to the lack of that spec on the listing. The company will not take a return of the product. BEWARE."
4,A promising debut!,"Noyes' first album is a wonderful collection of inspired songs from an artist with a bright future. I keep this CD in the same rotation as my David Gray, Jack Johnson, and Tom Waits CDs and it is right at home there. Noyes' grainy voice and catchy guitar leads evoke many moods as the album progresses, carrying you from relaxed and dreamy to excited and foot-stomping. While some of the songs seem to lack definitive choruses to sing along to, they all contain first rate instrumentals that will keep the tune running in your head long after the CD is done. I look forward with great anticipation to Noyes' next album."
2,Mediocre Prep. Tool,CFA Basics would be best utilized by a potential CFA candidate who has not partaken in formal education for over five years and needs a quick review of finance basics.This book is definitely not a good 'litmus' test of the caliber of matter you must conceptualize during your candidacy. If the material presented in this text was difficult for you to conceptualize you may be better off investing in something other than the CFA's rigorous charter process.
1,not worth....,"I agreed with the other reader. This book is really not worth the money. This book might be useful for high school students, but definitely not for college students, particularly for the people who are good at math."
5,Invaluable for a Starting Candidate in the CFA Program,"This book is simply an exceptional warm up for candidates that are entering the CFA program. It is a must read.The material is straight-forward, high-level, and clear. CFA Basics is obviously not intended to replace the core materials in the CFA program; however, it is an outstanding complement. It is also a quick read."
3,Don't waste your money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"While this book is a good pre-level 1 study guide, it does not come close to preparing you for what is on the actual exam. Save your money and check the book out at your local library."
2,Don't waste your money on this,"It may be good for beginners to understand the concepts, but it is a waste of your money if you are taking the exam. One frustrating thing about this book is that the formulas use a different notations/symbols/terminology than what you will find in CFA Institute books. So you are likely to go back and forth between notations and get confused. It is better to stick to CFA Institute notations as questions in the exam will use the terminology from their book.You will also be surprised to know that this book does not cover 2008 CFA Learning Objectives."
4,THANKS,"thats for sending it even thought it took longer than expected, but then again ive never used fast shipping before. so i guess that would take one week and 1/2"
3,Quality wasn't up to scratch.,"This DVD has the sound out of time with the picture(atleast for me), which was very frustrating. But the sound itself is good. This concert was very nice to listen to, its a taseteful one.The DVD cover is pepperred with spelling mistakes and poor information about arias and which operas they are from, which leads me to question how these were made. But it was such a cheap buy I shouldn't be complaining.PS. The rich bastards sitting behind him get on your nerves.Theres a funny little introduction to the DVD also, as well as a interview with the tenor which is good, but the quality of the DVD itself wasn't very good for me."
2,Notice me,The CD was not want I expected. A couple of the songs are good but that's it. Don't believe I will be getting any more. The one that is definetly 5 Star is 'Only make believe'
5,Take a trip down under,"I'm not sure why this young lady is not on top of the charts world wide . Some of her songs are breath taking .She has a great voice,cool style and stunning good looks . This disc is is a must have ."
3,It's a spark plug...,Nothing to say...nothing special...it works...magic it's not. I should have just picked up the cheapest plug I could find as performance is unremarkable.
3,"Response to Thurman's ""The Blacker the Berry""","Having recently finished reading the book, I wonder whether such debilitating attitudes still obtain in the African American community--attitudes that hold that dark skin is unattractive, even ugly. To answer my own query, my sense is that there are still elements of such thinking, born of self-denial and disafirmation. The character in Thurman's book, Emma, who was reared to think of herself as ""too black""; was not suffering from a personal problem. Color consciousness is not a black invention; it is a product of centuries of white racism. This book will help black parents to understand their notions of beauty."
4,"BRILLIANT, JUST NOT ENOUGHT DIALOGUE","Wallace Thurman's story is brilliantly told and still relevant after over fifty years. I would have given it five stars, but I felt there was too little dialogue between Emma Lou and the other characters and too much narration. I do not like knowing what every character in the book thinks and feels by being told so, I like to figure it out on my own. Thus, the omnipotence of the author and reader and too little dialogue makes the book a four. Yet is still lyrical, Thurman has a beautiful vocabulary and expositional style."
3,fair....,"This book brought up a very interesting topic/theme - intra-racism, which still haunts many races today in American society. However, despite what the prevailing theme has to offer it seems to fall short. Indeed, Emma Lou comes across hypocritical and immature, despite a vast room for growth - her character development seems stunted to an unnatural extent. There was a general lack of dialogue, I found the prose bland in comparison to other authors of the time, and the novel seemed choppy instead of smooth. The issue of intra-racism deserves full exploration and offers a full canvas for a writer to paint, but this novel just seemed flat. This book may be a good beginner novel on the subject, but there are many more novels of better quality that are much more thought-provoking on the matter."
1,Dantes comic,"First of all: there is NO navigable Table of contents. Secondly, the books are reverted, beginning with Paradise and ending with Hell. Need I say more?"
2,Best sound ever!,"No disputing the ear on this one. Every note loud and clear, oh so clear. But it all goes to signify very little regarding the sweep and ecstasies Strauss wrote into the score. Ozawa just doesn't cut the mustard. The ear was riveted while my mind wandered. Return to Karajan for the Strauss sublime."
5,Love them will never buy any others,These are a nice size. I love that they inter-lock so they stay together and makes them easy to find.Would reccomend!!! Great product. I should of got more then one pak!
3,Zyliss Corn holdersi,"Bought as gifts, they seem heavy and not easy for a child to hold on to. I will be interested to see what my daughter thinks of them."
5,Great Corn Holders,When these bright and colorful corn holders are just fabulous!! They are very solid and strong and much better than I had expected. They also slide together for safe storage!
5,Love the Interlocking,"These work as they are suppose to, are colorful and fun for the kids and interlock so you don't accidentally stab yourself. What else would you want?"
3,Um.....not quite.,"Ok, I admit some of these bands may have a slight connection to a few grunge bands of the 90's, but calling them the Godfathers of grunge is a stretch. Also, if this really was the Godfathers of grunge, where's Led Zeppelin, The Stooges, Black Sabbath, and Neil Young? I mean c'mon. Now looking at this as a pioneers of metal, or just classic rock collection makes more sense. Who doesn't enjoy ""Slow Ride"" and ""Stranglehold""? Personally I really like ""In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida"" and ""Godzilla"", but these songs aren't really the seeds of ""Angry Chair"" and ""Outshined""....or are they?"
2,Misleading Title,"These songs/artists are no more the godfathers of grunge than I am the King of England. A feeble attempt at jumping on the grunge bandwagon and claiming to have someting to do with it's origins. Great songs nonetheless, but a stupid title for a classic rock album."
3,content,The photo's are good but detail narrative is lacking. The book needs more detail specifics for someone to actually buid a computer that would work.
4,Good Read,This book was not better then the first book in the series but definately beter then the 2nd one. I found the story boring at time as some issues that were already discussed in the fist book where discussed again in the 3rd book. Other then that it was a good continuation.
2,Disappointing,"Having read the other two ""Princess"" books, I found this particular book quite disappointing. While the personal growth and maturation that has taken place within Sultana is quite obvious on the one hand, on the other hand, this book seems to be a self-indulgent journey into the plight of a ""poor little rich girl."" While Princess Sultana's concern about women still comes through in the book, it comes through as more of a subtext underneath the more overarching tale of her life within the incredibly wealthy royal family, and her struggles with alcoholism. It focuses more on *her* and much, much less on the plight of women in Saudi Arabia. For this reason, it's not a book that I would particularly recommend to readers who enjoyed the first two books."
4,"Riveting, and not just for women",Everyone should read this trilogy - both men and women. The only bad thing about this book is that it's the last one!
5,Jean Sasson is a genius,"I have read all 3 books about Princess Sultana and this one is my favorite. CIRCLE is not quite as sad as the first 2 books, it gives hope and encouragement. The Princess and her sisters form a circle against all the wicked men who take advantage of women. In the future I hope there will be more books about the Princess because her stories are truly amazing and encouraging. And I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in equality."
3,More personal than political.,"Princess Sultana's Circle is the third book of Jean Sasson's biographical accounts of a Saudi Royal's life. To be honest, Princess and Princess Sultana's Daughters were better books. However, if you enjoyed those, you will enjoy this one too.There is far less of a focus on women's rights in this book, and it reads like a series of anecdotes from Sultana's life. However, the extravagant lifestyle and the restrictive (by Western standards) customs of the Saudi Arabian elite make for interesting reading.In this book, Princess Sultana learns a bit more about herself, as she visits Bedouin tent villages, attends her niece's wedding to a much older man, and battles with alcoholism. The title refers to a protective circle of women, which Sultana asks us to form whenever we see women in trouble."
3,Not sure if it's true.,"It's not the best writing in the world, but it's okay. This ""character"" -- Sultana -- is honestly like a Middle Eastern Scarlet O'Hara. Spoiled, bratty, childish, self-centered. But it's not a bad book or a bad character. Just not sure how true it is."
1,Don't spend the money,"I read the first book and was appalled (although not surprised) at the treatment of women even within the wealthiest of households in Saudi Arabia. In fact, I read all 3 (because my Kindle makes it easy to just keep going!) - and by the time I got to the end of the trilogy and found the tone so saccharin and phony that I couldn't finish the third book. Princess Sultana emerges as a spoiled princess with an artificial sense of her own enlightenment."
1,An overindulged Princess,"I found this book to be very shallow. Princess Sultana's circle is an overindulged group of royal females who recognize the Arab woman as abused and degraded. They consider themselves helpless in saving their fellow woman in a nation driven by the superior male. She travels in private jets to different countries, spends $328,000.00 at a time at Bergdorf Goodman's in New York, and sucumms to alcholism. Her heroic feat was to stop a rape, and take the vicitim to a doctor. Princess Sultana has alot more work to do before she should consider herself a hero."
3,Interesting Reading,I have read almost all of the author's books about Saudi and the Middle East. I find the information fascinating and well written. The only reason I gave this book 3 stars is that it seemed a little redundant and too similar to her other books. Some of the same stories are the same from book to book. I think the best one is Princess.
5,Best of '07 and maybe '08.,"Finally En Lo Claro arrived and it did with a big bang!! First of all Elias (producer) is just sick making beats and Nelson did a couple too and that doesn't hurt neither. This is by far the most complete and awesome album of '07. a great mix of hip-hop and reggaeton songs and voltio's style of writing and rapping just puts this album up there with the best and Voltio can finally claim his stake as an elite Reggaeton artist (which I thought he was even before Voltage A/C) If you can buy this album then go get it... i'll assure you, you won't be dissapointed in Voltio!"
3,Interesting...,"This is not canon and should be read as such. There is evidence that it was written or edited much later than biblical works. It does, however, give an interesting perspective on how Adam and Eve might feel after being banished from the Garden of Eden. Interesting depiction of Satan as well... selfish and spiteful. The book is nothing to be afraid of and gives an interesting perspective."
2,"I recommend the work, but not the edition","I recommend _The First Book of Adam and Eve_, but I do not recommend this edition. The book is available for free online, along with numerous other items of Apochrypha and Pseudepigrapha.This editions is, moreover, miscategorized. The Kindle store lists it in ""Judaism,"" but it is a clearly Christian text--referencing the New Testament, and discussing prophesies of the coming of Christ!"
3,"Is good, but not exactly what I expected","The DVD is good on 5 out of the 10 songs it has. I liked the one where Richard plays with the Chinese girl. The one with the cartoon is kind of cute too. I just expected more of his number one hits such as careless whispers, Eleana, etc."
2,somewhat dissapointed,"the clips are good but the menu/titles are trash, plus if you look at his DVD essentials you find that about 60 percent of the tracks are on both DVd's"
1,Shamefully Poor Quality Ruins Great Movie,"A long-time favorite movie of mine, ""His Girl Friday"" is overdue for a thorough restoration. With its release on DVD, I hoped I'd see Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell looking crisp and sharp and hear their crackling dialogue with new clarity. Alas! This DVD appears to be a pirated copy made from a defective video tape. I was unable to tolerate more than five minutes of the fuzzy, ghostly spectres that flickered across the screen or the hisses and burbles that issued from the apparitions in place of dialogue. I seriously question the honesty of the manufacturer. An outrage.TedReinert@nyc.rr.com"
1,WARNING - DO NOT BUY THIS PARTICULAR DVD!!!!!!!!!!,"I was really disappointed when I saw that what I got in the mail was a knockoff DVD for the regular price (by A2ZCOS instead of a studio). What I expected came to pass. This is the only DVD that my player has ever been unable to read. First, a message came up from A2ZCOS saying that the movie was old and the sound quality might be lower than expected. Then the DVD player stalled and said that the DVD was ""dirty"" and was unable to read it. I really don't expect Amazon to be selling this junk, but I guess I have to double check from now on. As for the movie, it is one of the great films of all time. ----- I really consider that Amazon owes me for the wasted order, but whatever."
2,Ouch!,"I like Cary Grant, but I hated this movie. The acting was OK, and there were certain scenes which were very amusing, but the constant chatter throughout the film almost drove me nuts! From beginning to end, there was so much constant talking that it seemed like I was at an auction! Very fast paced and funny in places, this is nevertheless not one of Grant's better films."
2,So So,"His Girl Friday is an OK movie about newspaper reporters in the early part of the 20th century. I think it was supposed to be funny, and it may have been at the time, but most of the dialog was lost on me."
2,His Girl Friday,Not a Ros Russel fan. She bores me . Grant is fine as always but she ruines the movie for me.
5,Omg!! It is soo Good!,"Cary Grant and Rosaline Russell star in this movie that has Howard Hawks written all over it. From start to finish the dialect is so real and so fast-paced fun that makes you shudder with admiration. A must see, and oh-so-much fun!!"
2,"Great Movie, Rotten Edition","This is one of my top ten favorite movies. Unfortunately I originally ordered the d3k Classics Collection version. It was made from the worst copy in existance. My old worn out Crown Movie Classics edition would have been to master from. I saw the Colombia Classics realese at a friends house. Pay the extra seven bucks and get a DVD that is clean and clear and does the brilliant movie justice. Don't give the weasels, who get a dim scratchy version of a great movie, turn it into a sub-par DVD and market it to unsuspecitng dupes such as I, one more thin dime. It costs only pennies more to go first class."
5,One of the BEST!,This is one of my favorite movies. The dialog between the characters is lightning fast yet you can understand every word. Hysterical! They just don't make movies like this anymore. That's a pity! Get yourself a big bowl of popcorn and sit down and enjoy the way movies SHOULD be made.
1,"DVD sound and video was bad, but DK3 sent me a replacement","DVD quality is very, very, VERY, VERY poor! I'm not saying everyone should do this, but I bought the DK3 version of His Girl Friday from one of the other movie websites. When I got the DVD, I called DK3 (Their number is on the box) and told them about the poor quality. After a few minutes, the woman offered a replacement DVD. Then she offered me two replacements. They sent me Angel and the bad man and another film in their collection for free, plus I kept the movie. I think I'll keep it anonymous so they don't put me on a list. They might not do it again, but if you've already got it..."
1,"Great Movie, Stinky DVD","I've loved this movie for years and decided to add it to my collection. I should have known better than to buy this cheap version.The picture is terrible, the sound is horrible. [...]We had the TV volume turned to the maximum and still had a difficult time hearing the words; had I not already been familiar with the dialogue, I would have missed most of it. The picture quality is washed out in many scenes. What a shame. I want my $ back!"
1,Great Movie; Wretched Transfer,"I don't understand these reviews at all. I bought this disc based on the 4 and 5 star reviews, and now I wonder if they all work for th ecompany that mastered this.The transfer was HORRIBLE. The picture is herky-jerky, the sound is out of sync, there's no sharpness at all (did they master it from a 16mm print?).This is based - I will admit - on only the first 2 minutes. It was SO BAD we could not watch it any longer.The WORST looking DVD I have ever purchased from amazon bar none."
4,His Girl Friday dvd,Delivery of the item was prompt as promised and the quality of the DVD was as indicated. Completely satisfied with the transaction.
1,HIs Girl Friday,"BORING!! I didn't care for this story line at all. The characters weren't likeable, Rosalind Russell's character was even pretty obnoxious. It was difficult to watch and actually care about whether the two lead characters were going to get back together again or not."
2,Not as good as I expected it to be....,"I do love Cary Grant, but not in this movie. It is too fast-paced and there are many people talking simultaniously and you can't tell what the heck is going on most of the time. In other words, the movie is very inchoherant. There are a few funny scenes and it's OK for about the first ten minutes or so, but then everything goes haywire and there is also an abrupt ending. I love classic movies, but this one just succeeded in giving me a headache mostly. Not recommended. See BRINGING UP BABY (another Howard Hawks/Cary Grant film) instead."
5,Timeless Classic,"The banter-dialoque never gets old or less amusing. The character of Ralph Bellamy was done brillantly and of course Louie, is priceless."
5,what a wild ride!,If you have never seen this movie you are in for a rare treat! It is one of the best of it's kind.(maybe THE best.) Every actor in the movie delivers a great performance and the dialog is non stop. Saying this is a funny movie does not even begin to describe it accurately. One of my very favorites. Do not miss this one.
1,Very poor quality reproduction.,sound lacks clarity and image is noisy and has a very distant look to it. You can't enjoy this movie on this DVD. Sorry I bought it.Linda
4,An Oldie but a Goodie,"This film by Howard Hawks is an earlier version of ""the Front Page"" (with Jack Lemmon). The difference is that Hilde is a woman, allowing Hawks to focus on sexual tension as well as the drama and comedy of a newsroom. Although over 6o years old, this film still makes you laugh. Very quick dialogue gives the viewer a laugh a minute (well nearly). The storyline is quite unbelieveable, but enjoyable all the same. It's also an interesting film if you want to see what was being produced during the depression."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE THIS DVD VERSION!,You get what you pay for. This recording is worse than mediocre in terms of sound and picture quality.
1,Poor Quality,"Don't get me wrong, I love this movie. So I thought that getting a newer copy of the DVD would be in my best interest. WRONG. The lip sync is 2 seconds off and the video is watermarked. The whole thing is just poor quality. I guess that's what I get for trying to save a buck!"
1,"Great movie, poor DVD quality.","This is a wonderful movie but if one wants to buy it, get the VHS. The quality of the DVD is very bad! This is the first bad DVD I've encountered and will definitely be more careful next time before purchasing DVDs."
1,Picture quality and sound bad,"I was excited to add this video to my library of classic movies, but I was disappointed in the quality of the picture and sound. I am not sure if this is from a legit copy company or not. It is so bad that infringes on my ability to watch the movie. Unfotunatley, it is going in the trash."
1,Defective Copy**Buyer Beware,"Reviewed other buyers remarks prior to placing item on my wish list. This copy had the least number of negative remarks. Received item as a gift. During the opening scene the voices did not match the actors lip movement. Film ""quit"" three seperate times while viewing. Returned to Amazaon as item was not offered as an exchange. Buyer Beware of this particular copy of a really fun story. Hope Amazon can locate a better copy for future buyers."
5,Great movie at a great price,"Love this movie. It is fast paced and was glad to find it on Amazon. I actually bought it for my son, and now I need to get one for myself."
2,Ramblin' Rose,"I did not enjoy watching this DVD, because the actors talked so fast I had to glue my eyes and ears to the TV trying to follow the dialogue. I understood why they talked so fast, because in R. Russell's book LIFE IS A BANQUET, she told how she had hired someone to add extra ""smart-aleck"" lines to the screenplay to add interest. In my opinion, it ruined the movie! That style of dialogue was not unusual for the era in which the movie was made, I realize."
1,His Girl Friday,"I didn't buy my copy at Amozon, in fact I don'i remember were I got it.It is a Hollywood Classic Collection DVD.It's put out by Madacy.It's horrible to watch.I would like to but a new one, but I don't know what version to buy.Can you help me out?John"
1,Wait For A Better Version,"""His Girl Friday"" is one of my all-time favorite movies and I was looking forward to having a copy on DVD. I had read the reviews on here at Amazon about the D3K release and just figured people were exaggerating about the poor quality. I mean, it's DVD, it's gotta be great, right? Wrong. This version is awful. The sound is scratchy and the picture quality is worse than anything I've seen, even on VHS. As a matter of fact, my VHS copy is far superior. Even if you really love this movie, I suggest you wait until someone does a better job of restoring it. The only reason I give this DVD version one star is because it's still a wonderful movie."
1,D3K version stinks - do not rent or buy,"This is one of the most delightful and dizzy romantic comedies ever made. I've watched it on film, on tv, and on DVD. My single star rating refers to the butcher job done by D3K in their remaster. Probably the worst quality DVD I've *ever* rented. It had appalling muddy and hissy sound and looked as if it were filmed through vaseline. If you want a crisp clear DVD, stay away from the D3K version and find the Columbia Classics release."
1,"Great Movie, Bad Transfer","Madacy obviously takes old worn-out video copies from rental and tries to pass them off as DVD copies of the movie. This is one of my all time favorites and I bought the DVD because I'd worn out the Tape. My tape has better quality. If you have a choice, buy the movie from any other DVD producer. This version of The Front Page has some of Grant and Russel's finest work and the overlapping dialog is something indeed! Do buy the movie, the studio has a version which I believe sells for less than $X. Spend the extra bucks and you won't be disappointed."
3,Irritating icon,"This DVD of ""His Girl Friday"" was just fine except that it was packaged by something called Reel Enterprises. The reason that matters is that throughout the movie there was a ""RE"" logo in the lower right portion of the screen where today television networks put their logo on their programs. I was irritated by the presence of this logo. I am still irritated by that logo. I will look for Reel Enterprises products in the future and I will not accept any video product with their name on it."
3,Memo to Amanda Smythe,"In going over the reviews in order to consider whether I should get this book, I read yours in which you claim to know a great deal about military history. You say there was no point in bombing railroad tracks as they can easily be repaired. True. The way you knock out a rail line is by bombing its bridges."
1,Hagiography - Franklin D Roosevelt.,"Impossible for me to agree with the Cohen review. Franklin D Roosevelt was as interested in saving the Jews as I am in saving the Australian Funnel-Web Spider. Why, if FDR claimed that so ""many of my friends are Jewish"", was he busy during the pre-war years lobbying to keep Jews out of Harvard? That alone is an indication of his aims - leaving aside the manner in which America - led by FDR - watched while most of Europe's Jews were stripped of citizenship, livelihood, professions, all human dignity; then starved, ghettoized, and finally murdered in cold blood. Wake up: This man and his people allowed 75% of Europe's Jews to be annihilated while they certainly had more than enough power to stop the persecution and the process. Sheila McLaren."
1,Doesn't work,It doesn't work :(Had to buy a universal converter as well.The handle heats up but not the iron itself. very frustrating.
1,disappointed,"I was very disappointed with this curling iron. Because of the shape, size, and smoothness of the handle, I am unable to get a good grip, and it slips from my grasp when turning it. I have to hold onto the tip of the iron to help turn it and to keep from dropping it, but because the tip is too small to hold onto, I sometimes burn my fingers. I would not recommend this product."
4,"Helen of Troy Chrome Mega 1-1/4"" Curling Iron","Helen of Troy Chrome Mega 1-1/4"" Curling Iron.I'm happy with the way it curls,it gets very hot.curls stay in for ages."
2,One of those sequels that makes you long for the original,"""The Vengeance to She"" is the sequel to Hammer Film's very popular ""She."" Unfortunately, not only does Olga Schoberova take over the role of Ayesha (""She Who Must Be Obeyed"") from Ursula Andress, this 1967 film directed by Cliff Owen ""updates"" H. Rider Haggard's classic adventure story by making her a modern gal named Carol who cannot have a nice time on the French Riviera because she keeps hearing voices telling her to head east. Eventually she reaches the lost city of Kuma in Africa where she is worshipped as the reincarnation of Ayesha and wackiness ensues. This is one of those bad movies that becomes unintentionally funny. I suppose it might be more enjoyable as a double-bill with the original ""She,"" assuming, of course, your standards for enjoyment decrease steadily over the course of the evening."
3,the vengeance of she,The Movie came in good condition and I enjoyed it. The other movie Sinbaad The Sailor did not. The case was broken in two places. The movie played fair.
3,Review for Hot Street Salsa,"This is good but not quite as good as Salsa Fresca. It's more conservative than I expected, but good."
3,Wow!,"In order to understand this book you must have some knowledge on Buddhism or else you will be completely lost. The book has many eye opening thoughts that will make you say, ""Wow, that is so true about society."" I think it was a great book and recommend it to anyone who wants to understand a little more to what they already know. This is a great mind-opening book that will make you think twice about all those beliefs you've been taught, for example religious."
3,An old primer.,"This was probably a nice little introductory book for those unacquainted with Buddhism, Tibetan or otherwise, thirty years ago, but there are much better primers available now. Its claim that these are somehow ""secret oral teachings"" was not true even back then, and I doubt anyone in Tibet would have thought these teachings secret at any time in their history. Indeed, these are largely introductory teachings on the abhidharma and other Intermediate Scope topics that have been a common foundation for all schools of Buddhism for 2500 years. A few peculiarly Tibetan notions are thrown in at the end, but nothing ""secret"" as far as I can tell. You will do well to look elsewhere for your Buddhadharma."
2,Shallow and Incomplete,"I disagree with the reviewers that say the coverage is encyclopedic. On the contrary, every time I try to look up something in the book, I come away disappointed. Flat nipples, plugged milk ducts, mastitis, blisters on nipples -- either I can find nothing on the subject or at most a paragraph that isn't helpful. I generally like Dummies books, but this is the worst one I've ever seen."
3,Not as useful as hoping for,"I was hoping for alot more information from this book.I have only skimmed through the reading maaterial. I am a mom of three and have attempted to breastfeed everytime so naturally I knew a pretty good bit, but as with each child you experience new things and so I was hoping to get some helpful notes to try and help build milk suplly to meet my daughters demand- gfor some reason I have always had to supplement. Anyway- unless you are new to breastfeeding this book is not for you. All the basics are covered but they are for beginners...after three months the books sorta ""falls off."""
3,Not as good as his two volume biography...,Kershaw combined his two volume biography into one volume and something was lost in the process and it lacks the eye for detail and overall coherence of the earlier work.
2,quite boring,"Have an interest in History of the 20th century and was trying to get into the opinion of the people that lost the 2nd World War. What better than to read Hitler's own thoughts direct ? I found Mein Kampf very clarifying in the way of trying to get into Hitler's head, and in the process understood(or thought I did !!) a couple of things about what he had in mind. This beeing said I found the reading very tiresome and quite boring. It is still very difficult to understand how a madman like this could pull together a whole cultured nation together, but there are quite a few nutty caracters that have done this in the past, and still nowdays(fortunately not in such a large scale(yet!))"
4,Not Definitive but very helpful,There can never be enough attempts to give insight into one of the world's greatest monsters. There is valueable details about the man and the culture that fostered his rise to power.Particularly helpful in describing the reactions to the developments on the eastern front. A worthwhile purchase for any student of the period.S.J.Tagliareni author of Hitler's Priest
3,"a conformist biography....but wait, it can be remedied!","My suggestion? Skip this biography if time is short and read the one book that provides the necessary insight and understanding of Hitler that is found no where else: R.H.S. Stolfi's 'Hitler: Beyond Evil and Tyranny'.Oh yes, my friends......read this book! It is a biography of the Fuhrer like no other. It is the one book that needed to be written."
4,Good history-not biography,"This book is a very good history of Germany while Hitler was in power. The book does not really seem like a biography. Particularly during World War 2 there is little analysis or description of what Hitler was doing as an individual. Some personal details may seem trivial compared to the big events of the war, but part of the enjoyment of a biography is in reading the personal details.Particularly in Hitler's case, as he was so evil, one would like some in depth knowledge of what his personal behavior was like. Moreover, as the book moves through the war years there is excellent detail and description of the Eastern Front, but the description of the West and North Africa gets much less attention.If you are interested in WWII, it is an excellent read, but if you are looking for deep insight into Hitler it is somewhat lacking."
2,Caution - wrong product description,"This Kindle book is not the book that's described under ""Product description."" The description is of the single-volume abridgement of the two volume work of which this Kindle book is the first. Be sure you know what you're ordering."
4,structural analysis,"This book Focuses on the power structure of the nazi party. It doesn't reveal much about personalities or everyday life, but describes the interrelation between the beauracrats, industrialists, land owners, populace, and nazi party members. It is appropriate for anyone interested in political structures and how they are held together. It gives a fascinating look into the accumulation of power into one charismatic leader and the appointed henchmen/disciples who would literrally do anything to please the whims of their demigod, and thus gain more power for themselves, And how this monopolistic and 'anarchic' power structure ultimately led to such a terribly disfunctional outcome."
4,Enfield obsesssion,"Very pleasantly surprised by content of book. Was at first disappointed--expected a larger and thicker edition. However, found it to be very well-written and easily absorbed; totally useful as a reference in my backpack at gun shows, etc. Although compact, the book is very concisely laid out, logically sectioned out, and easy to read. Sufficient photos and line drawings provide enough clarification for a strong basic knowledge base on the subject of Mark I's and III's. The other variations are also discussed and described in a cursory manner. Other books in this series exist for them by the author.Overall quite happy with the book--hits the mark as a basic primer; and shows an astounding variety of markings and other variations throughout the parts list for these neat weapons of history. Good value for the buck--buy it."
2,Mary Frances Sewing Book,"I recently saw this book, newly published, as a hardcover with beautifully done color illustrations. While I undestood this book was to be a paperback, I was deeply disappointed to find it to be an undersized, black and white edition."
5,wonderful book that takes us back,"i have the whole set of mary frances books (in hard cover). they are reproductions. these books are so wonderful, its hard to put into words. the books are a special piece of history and i highly recommend all of them. the mary frances sewing book is esp. charming."
4,Southworth,"I had the copy of this book that was purchased for my mother in 1920 and I used it as a nine year old to learn to sew - almost 50 years ago. My doll may have had somewhat dated clothes, but part of what I learned was how to alter the looks to make them more up to date. My one disappointment with the paperpack edition is that the original had tissue patterns that could be removed and used along with a paper gatefold that could be traced. My original still has many of the tissue patterns. None-the-less, the paperback is still a fabulous book to teach children hand sewing."
2,No patterns,"I'm glad I didn't buy this book new, as I would have been seriously annoyed to find that this fairly expensive paperback is neither remarkably attractive, nor very practical, since it does not include the crucial patterns. I wanted THOSE patterns to re-clothe a 1914 16"" doll whose original clothes were sewn by my grandmother around 1915. In this edition of the Mary Frances Book, the pictures of individual stitches are quite small, and I'm not sure that anybody could learn these classic stitches from this book alone.The book seems to be a re-issue for those who simply want to re-experience earlier readings of it - it does *not* fulfil the purpose that the original did."
3,"Charming, but Useful?","While I agree with all that this book is lovely as a nostalgia item, I would like to hear from someone who's actually used it in conjunction with a modern child. I loved looking at the pictures and conjuring up the idealized little girl and ""many happy hours"" spent in the sewing room, busily stitching away, but frankly, found the story thread just plain silly, the verses hopelessly contrived, and the ""character"" banter tedious to the point of annoyance. I am a grandmother: any chance my granddaughter - or anybody's? - will go for this?"
3,try and look on the bright side...,"so, warner has come up with yet again a Small and incomplete collection. at least this time it appears on DVD and not only on blu-ray and it will only (?) include unrelaesed before cartoons (unlike thier 'platunim collection' and those essential bugs and duffy collections).at this stage, i guess this is as good as it gets."
2,OK for its budget,"This is a low budget with a script that had great promise. This action-packed military movie stars Wesley Snipes and Emma Samms. Both of these actors do an ok job with what they are given to work with. Like another reviewer said, let us be thankful they did not try for any flashbacks to tell back-story in this film.The story line has the U.S.A. being tricked into targeting a fully functional nuclear reactor that was captured by Chechen rebels. And as we watch the missile being launched that will cause massive chaos for the region, if not the world, the Special Ops team led by Snipes figures out a way to stop the disaster from happening in an all to convenient and simple way. Still worth grabbing a bag of popcorn and checking it out from your local library."
1,The worst film of 2005?,"This movie is ABSOLUTE NONSENSE! Comes complete with bad acting, unbelievable plot, bad music, low budget effects, etc. There is nothing entertaining about this film...nothing! The writer and director should suffer a slow, painful death for this. If it came on TV you would change channels within 5 minutes...Enough said."
1,Marksman,I saw his preview and liked what I saw and got it via Netflix.. popped it in my dvd..within FIRST min.. I stopped it and took it out.. Only reason.. this movie.. TOO CHEAP to add the feature for close caption or subtitles for deafies like me.. Forget it.. if thats the way they want.. No more renting any movies from this movie production company.
5,This movie Deserved 3.5 stars out of 5 but...,"I Admit that it was a low budget movie and action scenes were extremely primitive. But I couldn't find anything wrong about Snipes. It was a very good movie and the story was reasonable and intresting. Remember that, many foreign adorable movies make with low budgets. comparing the quality of a movie with it's budget is absolutely wrong. I Also admit that this movie did not suit Snipes, but that doesn't mean Snipes is a falling star.I think people who rated this movie with one or two stars, have expected Rambo out of it and got dissapointed. this was a memorable movie and the storyline was rather new. so the real and honest grade of it was 3.5 stars ot of 5. but I gave it 5 stars to increase its rating."
1,"simply, really bad","Simply put, this is a bad movie. Low budget. A script with as much substance as smoke. I was given this movie. I am going to give it back."
1,Awful!,I resent the comment of the reviewer who said this is the worst film in 100 years. I make it 200. The other reviewers have noted the idiotic factual mistakes that makes this such a howler. I just loved the U.S Air Force personnel with Scottish and English accents. They must have overrun the $500 budget at that point.
1,Damm you Wesley,"This is my fault im writing this!! I read the reviews for this film before i watched it, and i had seen the tralier but being such a huge fan of Blade 1,2,3 and all his other movies i thought they cant be true!!!!!!......how wronge i was:( Theres no need to go all into it, its been done before. Its just bad,so so so bad!!"
1,BIG FAT ZERO!,"I dont use all caps much, but this one is well deserving of that title. What a waste of time. Let me break it down:Screenplay: ZERO STAR- if you actually pay attention to the lines that are uttered, most of it reads like the weekly supermarket circulars- TRITE.Directing: ZERO STAR- I should pay attention to who did the directing so as to AVOID any other garbage he puts out there.Acting: ZERO STAR- Was it a bad cast or bad director? Or bad idea? Maybe the other actors needed to get work badly. But Snipes had no excuse. He fell three notches on this one. Go back to being a vampire. Oh this came before I think.Visuals: half star- some nice flying shots. pyro-technics not very realisitc.Three words of wisdom: AVOID. AVOID. AVOID."
1,The worst martial arts magazine!,"Black Belt is the absolute worst martial arts magazine on the market. It used to be the best back in the 80's and 90's, but now the publisher tries to make it a mix of some type of MMA rag and Soldier Of Fortune. The combination doesn't work and leaves out the core reader: traditional martial artists. The MMA puff pieces are a joke. Combine that with the fact that the ""magazine"" consists of about 90% ads and 10% articles, and it's only a matter of time before BB goes the way of General Motors. According to Kenpo karate legend Al Tracy, Black Belt magazine circulation is only about 1/5th of what it was 10 years ago. After browsing through the past few issues at bookstores, I can understand why.If you're looking for a decent martial arts magazine, I'd recommend either Inside Kung Fu, Action Martial Arts (only publish 4 issues per year though), Classical Fighting Arts, Kung Fu Tai Chi, or Martial Arts Masters."
1,Just wait and see,"Paid for on Feb 8th, just found out first issue will not be shipped until April 27th. However, it has been paid for since Feb.This is the second time I have attempted to subscribe to Black Belt Magazine. Last time it was over four months before first issue was shipped and we were told ""this is your last issue!"" It was our FIRST issue. They double billed us for it and told us we could not cancel our order. I am hoping that when we finally receive this one that we actually get them."
1,Black Belt Mag.,"Ordered in September 2006, and have yet to receive an issue, today is Dec 21.06. Most of the time you can count on amazon, but I'm beginning to think that this is a rip off. I rated one star, because your can't give no stars"
1,Complete rip-off,"I ordered this magazine subscription Aug. 25, 2006 and have yet to receive an issue!"
2,Almost good enough.,"I bought these gloves to use as motorcycle gloves when it gets down around 30 degrees. They work better than the ones they replaced but, on a 45 minute ride in bitter cold they didn't quite stand up as I had hoped. Maybe I was asking too much. Where O where is my perfect glove?"
5,Standing up for the Faith,"Goes bit by bit, addressing the attacks on the One, Holy, Catholic, Apostolic Church. Alot of footnotes giving sources from which facts are taken from. Catholics are often quiet, when attacked about their faith, but not Karl Keating. THIS BOOK IS A GRAND SLAM!!!"
1,READ GOD'S WORD INSTEAD!,"I read this book as a Catholic. Years after, by God's amazing grace I was saved! So, now I can say without reservation that this book is hogwash! Read the Bible instead. For by abiding in God's Word, you shall come to know the Truth, and indeed, the Truth shall set you free!"
5,AWESOME BOOK!!!,One of the BEST!! So many people have converted to Catholicism because of this book. Many have come to a greater understanding and appreciation of the Catholic faith because this book clears up all the misconceptions people have heard and because it reveals the truth of Catholicism right from the horses mouth. A must read!
4,Not as relevent as it once was,"Karl Keating book is an excellent answer to specific professional anti-catholics. Unfortunately most of the groups addressed are in decline and are not in the forfront of anti-catholic teaching that must now be addressed. As I haven't read Keating's latest tome I can't say if he addresses the situation but for its time it must be powerful.The second section is more useful but it is may be a little tough for the layman so I would suggest having the Catechism handy as you read.I do confess I get so sick of hearing the tired and baseless charges of Catholic's baning the bible hundreds of years ago. Ignoring the falseness of the charge; the idea that a member of the protestant church whose leader Luther actually REMOVED several books to suit his own beliefs, books which were accepted for centuries makes the charge even more laughable.Unfortunately it just goes to show that books of this nature will likely be needed till the 2nd coming."
4,Extremely well written and great for beginning apologetics,This book is a great book for the beginning apologist or any Catholic who wishes to see answers to fundamentalist charges against the Church. Well worth reading!
4,An Amusing Read even for non-Christians!,"As a Jew, I turned to this book to help me understand some of the fundamental (no pun intended!) differences between Catholic and Protestant Christianity, and I was not disappointed.I felt that the book was an ""amusing"" read because I feel that my stance outside of these two religions gives me an objectivity that would not be possible for most Christians. In a sense, although I would like to agree wholeheartedly with Keating's position, there is room for me to believe that the Fundamentalists are right, too (or that neither of them is!).Anyone interested in analyzing modern religious responses to the Christian Bible would do well to look through this book. Mr. Keating writes lucidly and well on subjects which are obviously dear to his heart."
4,For Catholics who want a solid grounding in what fundamentalism is,"I jumped around in this book and found Keating did a very good job at presenting a fundamentalist view on various doctrines of the Church. He then exposed the Church's counter argument very well. As always, a Catholic can make an argument but should not get caught up in an arrogant,condescending, pissing contest with those who can not or will not be objective. Some people just love to argue, but others are truly seeking truth and their questions are sincere probing. This book will be helpful in arming yourself with the very Biblical nature of Catholic Doctrine and liturgy. In all things we must be prepared. This is great preparation for Catholic Apologists."
1,Boat Missed; Awful,"As someone who believes that Catholics can easily trump fundamentalists in a doctrinal interpretation of CHristianity, I find this work awful. He drifts from serious argument to ""Ad hominem"" insult with no organization or consistency. There is no real defense of the faith and systematic exposition of fundamentalist errors. This will only convince the convinced. It gets one star only because it respectfully notes that Catholics become fundamentalists out of honest and serious belief and not merely out of psychological factors. Beyond that it's a major disappointment."
2,A most disengenuous attack on a straw-man,"One example of Keating's practice of misdirection can be found in his attack upon Lorainne Beottner and his book, Roman Catholicism. Keating mis-quotes Boettner, pulls partial phrases out of context, and attacks the man himself. Keating's work is almost insulting, as could be discerned by any careful reader. I heartily recommend a book published as an answer to Keathing's attack on Boettner... ""FORMIDABLE TRUTH: A vindication of Lorainne Boettner,"" by Robert M. Zins, Th.M., in which Mr. Zins, with surgical precision, proves Keating wrong on every point."
1,Simplistic and ultra-conservative,"Like most of the popologists (""pop apologists) at Catholic Answers, Karl Keating has a simplistic and, ironically, an almost fundamentalist approach to Catholicism. Keating holds ultra-conservative views (much like James Akin, Tim Staples, Bob Sungenis, et. al.) and works from the ultra-conservative fringe of non-scholarly Catholicism. This book is consistent with the ultra-conservative Catholic approach. If you simply want to dispel some common fundamentalist misperceptions of Catholicism, then this book is reasonably useful. Otherwise, I would stick with genuine Catholic Biblical scholars like Raymond E. Brown, John P. Meier, and Joseph A. Fitzmyer. While more difficult to read, their scholarship is vastly superior to pseudo-scholars like Keating, and their moderate and orthodox approach to exegesis is refreshing in the recent resurgence of Catholic fundamentalism and biblical literalism that those like Keating advocate."
1,Where did he get that from???,"As a Catholic, some protestants have been asking me some scriptural questions so I got this book. I was hoping that this could answer some of my/there questions. I was disappointed that Karl's use of scripture was not really supportive of what he said it meant. I know as Catholics we understand the Bible is not reliable. Karl should not have lead me down this goose chase that we should look anywhere except to the Pope and the magesterium for answers. Get yourself a cathecism and forget this book!!!!"
1,Better books on the topic than this one,"I found this book lacking intellectual honesty, condescending and not presenting documentation to back up the author's arguments."
4,Great intro for begining apologetics,"If you want to know who the enemies of the Catholic Church are or how the Church is mis-represented by those who are not informed, this is the book to have. Excellent in every way except; Not for the faint of heart nor the sensitive non-catholic."
4,"Not exhaustive, but comprehensive","This is not a great book, but it is a good book. It gives a comprehensive overview of anti-catholic attacks on Catholic doctrine and practice, and provides some solid analysis and responses. It is a great place to start looking at the question of Catholic doctrine, at lease insofar as it differs from american fundamentalist doctrines. It goes a long way in dispelling many of the misconceptions that are held by anti catholics. Sadly, I must admit that i used to be anti catholic myself. This book was one of many books that cheared up some of the doctrinal issues I had against the Church.There are deeper, more scholarly books available that go into greater detail about doctrinal issues, but this is a good beginning point."
5,Outstanding Biblical Scholarship,"Karl Keating does a fantastic job of explaining the solid biblical foundation for Catholic teaching on the Eucharist, the teaching authority of the Church, infant baptism, and a number of other important topics. Where necessary, he returns to the original Greek and Aramaic texts to support his interpretation of key bible passages. His writing style is crisp, lucid and engaging; quite simply, this book is fun to read. The first few chapters, which explore the dark underbelly of anti-Catholicism, are perhaps a bit longer than they need to be. Nonetheless, I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in understanding the Catholic faith."
4,BUSINESS OWNER,THE MAX EC-301 CHECKWRITER IS A VERY NICE MACHINE AND EASY TO USE. THE IMPRINTING IS LARGE AND CLEAR TO READ.
1,Do NOT buy this book,This is one of the most horribly written books that I have ever read. There is nothing here that has not been presented before in 2nd year psychology courses. Freedman and Combs did a terrible job here.
2,a primer in narrative but also in political correctness,"I can't help but think that anthropologist Clifford Geertz, whose ideas about narrative and culture underlie much of this therapy, would be disappointed by this book. Anyone who has worked with tribal peoples knows that you can't use techniques to get them to fit your agenda, even when it is a ""progressive"" one like the agenda in this book. Aren't therapists supposed to let the clients' needs define therapy? If so, why do the authors of this book so often insert definitions reactively counter to their view of what's ""oppressive""? Is it not better to have no agenda at all? This is not a bad book by any means. But it is limited in scope. Trust in the narrative process demands a true shared inquiry, not one driven by culture bound feminist and politically correct ideology."
4,well worth the money,"I guess ""photoshop Junkie"" must be an incredibly experienced Illustrator user to know all the tips in this book. I've used Illustrator for around 5 years and there were lots of tips that I didn't know. Okay, I probably could have found many of them by searching around in the Help Files, but why bother when they're right there in the book?There were enough tips in there for me to say it was worth the money. Why not 5 stars? Some of the graphics were not the greatest (although that really didn't affect the tips I guess, so I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could)"
4,killer tips,"If you do not have alot of time in your day and a basic understanding of Illustrator this is perfect. Each tip is just that a tip. Half page explanation, easy way to do things."
3,Disappointing,"I bought this book based on the wonderful customer reviews and was very disappointed. Most of the items can be easily found by anyone exploring the menu bar or palette options. In my opinion such things don't qualify as ""hidden secrets,"" as the cover claims.I did find one tip that I use (a keyboard command to reset the horizontal scale of type to 100%). It saves me, oh, a minute a month or so. At that rate the book will pay for itself in five years!"
1,Pass this one up,"I do not agree with the 5-star reviewers of this title. If you have used Adobe Illustrator for more than, oh say 15 minutes, you probably know more than this book will teach you, and anything else can be found out by using the pull-down menu system, or the Help button.Okay, maybe not fifteen minutes, but there is nothing here, no ""hidden"" tips and tricks. And if the creative value of this title were to be measured from 1 to 10, it would rate a minus 6.I hear Dave's doing another book for CS2; however, if it's like all the other Kelby-clone titles, it will just be a rehash of this book with a few screen shots from the new application.Save your money on this title, and treat yourself to a nice dinner."
1,Miss advertised,"This item is advertised as a DVD however, when it comes in the mail it is actually an old VHS. When calling customer service they advised it was just a misprint and ""eventually"" someone will pick up on this and change it. Meanwhile, I purchased an item I do not have the technology to utilize. Very disappointed in the product and Amazon."
5,Great Recipes!,"I am the very definition of a foodie. I'm also health conscious.WOW! I've had this book for a few months, and I got it used figuring if I didn't like it, no big deal. This week so far I've made the chicken pot pie, sugar cookies, and pumpkin spice muffins. They all have come out wonderfully and you cannot tell they are low-cal!! Tonight I'm making the mustard dill pork chops with pumpnickel stuffing and tomorrow onion & pepper braciole! I bet you didn't think you could eat that stuff and have it come in at under 400 calories!!!I'm not even a reader of family circle, but this book is probably one of my most used cookbooks :)"
5,Tasty and Easy,"I cook from this book several times a week and I've yet to find something that I wouldn't cook again or that I wouldn't serve to guests. I'm not the best or most patient cook, so I really appreciate the quick and easy aspect. A couple of things to consider - one of the ways they reduce calories is by using veggies such as peppers and zucchini to stretch normally high calorie meals. Also, many of the recipes are very flavorful, not necessarily spicy, but lots of strong sauces and spicing. If you don't like those things, this might not be the book for you....luckily we do."
3,Good recipes but inconvenient number of servings,"I got this book as I'm always on a lookout for great tasting healthy recipes. I have made a few dishes from the book and all of them turned out well (blueberry cottage cheese pancakes were especially good). So I have no complaint about the quality of the meals. However, our family consists of two people and I usually cook for two nights - read 4 servings. The MAJORITY of the recipes are for 6 servings. It is highly inconvenient as 6 doesn't adjust easily to 4, and I don't like freezing leftovers.Because of this issue, I rarely look in the book when I'm searching for a recipe.If you have a big family or don't mind freezing leftovers then I would reccomend the book, as the recipes are good. But if you're single or have two people in your household, you might want to look elsewhere for your everyday cookbook."
2,eat What you Love & Lose,"I think a more current book would have less fattening recipes.I found these recipes on the heavy side.If it was a regular cookbook, there are some good recipes."
2,OK.......just OK.,"Movie was OK, not what I expected. It's worth 1 watch. Mr. Whittaker was really good in this film. He's the only memorable actor in the movie."
2,This Bird doesn't fly,This movie was a disappointment for me. I had hoped to learn about a creative musician's life but that is not the story here. The acting is great but the threads of plot are just too disconnected. I suspect those who love this film know Mr. Parkers life so well that the holes in the story don't keep them in the dark the way I felt. Clint Eastwood directs this movie like my 15 year old son who doesn't understand how to show me something that he knows really well and I don't. That's the feeling I had watching this movie.Unless you know Charlie Parkers life very well I'd pass on this movie.
3,"GREAT MUSIC, BUT THAT'S ABOUT IT.","Although the soundtrack is very good, it tends to concentrate more on his more ""commercial"" recordings, such as ""The Bird with Strings,"" rather than on non-studio recordings, which give a truer picture of Parker's genius. His technique was impeccable, arguably the best among sax alto players (and they can be very good).Some of the characterizations I found hard to take. Michael Zelniker's portrayal of Red Rodney (not all that highly regarded among the bop trumpet players), is played as kind of wimpy amd awe struck.Diane Salinger's baronness Nica is too dramatically vampy and ""European."", I thought.Clint Eastwood's own fascination with Parker is to be appreciated, of course, and he is to be credited with bringing us a picture of the bop era (bop may be the most important development in jazz), however flawed."
5,Parker still managed to put out good music in his troubled l,"Buster being so envieous of Parker I thought was compelling, heres a man he thought could not play a note as good as he could. Turns out the jazz loving community and the world did, and when Buster tried to pass money to him and he refused, Buster saw for sure who was the greatest alto saxaphone player was... Charlie(Yardbird)Parker."
2,Tried to watch it twice - kept falling asleep...,"I know this is an unpopular opinion - but this is NOT a good film. It isn't even an interesting one! I love jazz, and love documentaries - but this was just confused and boring."
1,Warning - DVD does not play in computers,"I saw this movie a long time ago and liked it. Unfortunately,the DVD is ""copy protected"" and will not play on mostcomputers unless you have CSS cracking software. Too bad.I don't want to buy a DVD player just to watch a few DVD'sso I play them on my computer. But not this one."
5,"By far , the finest hour of Clint Easwood !","Eastwood made a real gem with this delicate , haunting and powerful portrait around this living legend : this pioneer of elusive sound sax : Charlie Parker .Forrest Whitaker played a superb role (the best of his career to date) with this acting . The photography ; the shot angles , the painful script which never falls in the melodrama soap . Eastwood reveals with a supreme maestry his masterful technique as atmosphere creator . Since he was obviously a hard fan of Parker , he left for the eternity this deep insight to the emotional mood of Charlie who died so young (34) and whose early loss still shocks the world jazz . Can you imagine the glorious solo between Bird and Miles Davis for instance with Bill Evans at the piano? . Too beauty to be true , indeed .Thanks Mr . Eastwood for your double rendition ; to Jazz world and the Cinema .It is useless to recommend the soundtrack of that film .Do you know another Laura version which can match with this one ?"
3,Mainly For Fans Of Charlie Parker,"The music in here is excellent and makes jazz appealing even to a non-jazz enthusiast like me. It better, because that's what the subject of the film is: jazz, and Charlie Parker, in particular. ""Bird"" was his nickname, and Parker was a good subject matter for a film - not a pleasant subject most of the time, but for jazz fans the man is a legend.I thought the acting was good, especially by the two main people: Forest Whitaker, playing Parker, and Diane Venora as wife ""Chan.""My major complaint was that it was too long. To make a film over 160 minutes when much of it is a ""downer"" it tough to sit through. It's generally a story about what can happen to a man who is addicted to drugs, which is what happened to this giant of jazz. That's the part of fhis life that is emphasized,, so it makes this movie a very long, sordid tale, not a happy one.Unless one is a big jazz aficionado, one viewing of this would be plenty....but it's worth a look."
3,Not bad but could have been better,"Anytime a movie is made about a major musical innovator like Charlie Parker it needs to be applauded. In general I liked the movie but there were two dislikes that I have. First, Forest Whitaker is a capable actor but I don't believe he was the best choice to play Parker. Secondly, the story line depicts certain points in Parker's life that are somewhat lesser known. For example, I was unaware of Red Rodney until I saw this film. I know Miles Davis however, yet he wasn't depicted at all. I guess certain concessions had to be considered. It is highly doubtful that another movie will ever be made about Parker which means that many people will form their impressions about him and his life from this film."
2,a self absorbed paean to a dead junkie who made good music,"clint eastwood directed this labor of love about jazz great charlie parker. like most labors of love, its a failure in appealing to all but true devotees. i shall comment here about jazz buffs: there are no more obnoxious fans of any art form than the fans of jazz. it is perfectly fine that they choose to discuss among themselves arcana like recording dates, side men, and the like. all fans of various art forms do that in their own little world, but jazz buffs expect the rest of us to listen to them and are positively insulted when we begin to yawn. ok, back to the movie; speaking of yawns ..."
4,Never forgot it,"Forrest Whittaker is one of the best actors in Hollywood. It's a shame we don't see more of him but he had a triumph with Bird. Some critics have said it wasn't completely accurate. That's true. Bird spent his adult life as an addict and there's nothing romantic or touching about that. Bird's relationship with Chan wasn't as portrayed in the film but the full, unfiltered story of his life would've been more than most audiences could bear. This is the ""lite"" version, kind of like Lady Sings the Blues but it's still a great film that gives you an idea of it's subject's genius and it well worth the money."
4,Very nice movie,"I enjoyed watching this movie, maybe a bit to long but still well done and produced. Nice prospective on Charlie Parker and his era and times."
5,"Now THIS is a ""pop"" album at it's best!","Unlike my other esteemed reviewers, I actually saw Silver open for the Doobie Brothers in Missoula, Montana in 1977. Live, they were as good or better than what they sounded like on vinyl. John Batdorf (from the sorely missed ""Batdorf & Rodney""), Tom Leadon (brother of ex-EAGLE Bernie), and of course Brett just WOW'd the crowd. How many bands can you think of who can encore with a slow ballad (""So Long, Farewell"") and have the crowd literally screaming for more? The different moods of this album show off all the individual's talents and every song is a winner. I've literally worn out 3 copies of the vinyl and am so glad for the CD to finally come out. Now if Arista could just find the ""lost"" 2nd album that was rumored to be almost finished when the band sadly ended."
4,THE VENTURES/NEW DEPTHS CD,PROCDUCT WAS RECEIVED AS ADVERTISED.BRAND NEW FACTORY SEALED..A GREAT CD BY A FANTASTIC GROUP..DOWN SIDE WAS THE OUTRAGEOUS PRICE..HOWEVER I WANTED IT SO I PAID
2,definately new depths for the Ventures' sound,"The addition of various guest artists to the basic Ventures has definately boosted the sound and the overall liveliness of the music. I love the extra licks of Jerry McGee and Leon Taylor I think is better than Mel. The extra textures, renditions, and the extra players in some of the songs really make them jive. I would love to see some more collaborations and new music like this to appear. This disc has become an all-time favorite of mine and show The Ventures have reached another plateau in the quality of their playing."
1,Worthless,"This product does not stay upright on a round bar as shown on the manufacturer's web site. The bottom line is that your wheel will end up resting on your roof and damaging your clear coat over time. If you drive an old beat up car, or if you'd like your car to start looking old and beat up, this may be okay for you. It would be easy for Yakima to design this with a brace that fit into a bike rack next to the wheel spoke. There are better products available for this purpose."
2,Perfect playing,Very clever work but not good to listen to. There are many soloists with much more interesting and melodic improvisation.
4,Have Case Will Travel,"The Case Logic dual screen DVD player case was given to my grandchildren along with new DVD players for Christmas. It holds both DVD players, the cables, splitters, chargers AND......it even holds a couple DVDs. It makes it convenient to travel with movies. It would have been nice if it was a little larger because it was a tight squeeze to get everything in the case."
4,Perfect fit for dual 9-inch DVD players!,"This case was perfect for our portable 9-inch Dual DVD players. Each screen had it's own compartment. And we were able to fit 3 sets of headphones, both power cords, the car adapter, a headphone splitter, and a few other various cords in the front compartment. I only wish there was more storage for the actual DVDs (we always bring a big variety on our trips). So, other than having to bring a separate case for movies, this case worked great!"
4,Dual DVD Case,"I received prompt deliverary, tight fit for all accessories but they do fit..quality of case is fair for the money"
5,Great Dual Screen Case,"The case was the perfect fit for our dual screen players. It is roomy and is very sturdy. We don't carry the DVD players in the car everyday, we only use them for long trips, so this bag is great for storing everything in one place in the closet."
5,Dual screen DVD player case,"We love it. We have it for over 7 months. It's durable and handy in the car or at home to keep 2 players in one place. We also keep all the huck-ups in there, as well. They fit ok together with headphones."
4,"Holds your 2 DVD screens (7 or 9"" - I forget what we have) and protects them!","The bag does what it says - holds the DVD player and 2nd screen, all the cords and a few DVDs if you take them out of the cases. Does what I wanted it to do for a reasonable price."
3,great price but can't fit all,"Does not fit all 7 to 9, mine was a bit bigger then usual and did not fit at all."
4,Mostly good for organization,"Not enough pockets for all the wires, etc., otherwise it is a really good case to keep DVD player in."
5,Case logic 7-9 inch DVD Case,Wonderful product. Everything fits neatly in this case for two DVD players and accessories. It travels well and can take it everywhere I go.
2,Too small,"After much searching and reading the reviews I thought I found my replacement case, however its just too small. I have a 7-inch portable DVD player with an extra screen that has served us very well. While the case holds the screens nicely, it becomes very difficult to get all the cords into the extra pocket. I got it in, but then another problem came when I tried to install the unit into the car. The case leaves no room to accommodate the cords to be plugged in...the car power cord and the cord that connects the two units. The case that came with my players had slits for the cords to plug in. I didn't expect this, but I thought there would be ample room for the cords to plug into the sides of the player, especially considering it is made to hold players up to 9-inches.Something to consider before buying this case."
2,a disappointment,"We are also big fans of Fred Levine but I was really dismayed when we received this video. It's almost nothing like his other efforts. It spends half the time on his kids - riding in the car, checking into a hotel, eating pretzles, riding on a hotel shuttle etc etc, and almost no time on explaining what goes on in the plane or at the airport. No explanation of the control tower, the cockpit, loading the plane with supplies or any of ther other interesting things I was hoping to see. I definitely got the feeling that the only reason he made this video was so he could write off a family vacation on his taxes. If you want to see vacation footage of the Levine family, then this video is for you. Otherwise, save your money."
3,OK but let's see more from the pilot's view,"I'm a big fan of Fred Levine's videos as they treat children with respect and aren't ""stupid"" in their approach to teaching children. Levine's ""Road Construction Ahead"" (excellent video) motivated me to purchase ""Cleared for Takeoff"". The video has lots of closeups of planes taking off, from a ground view but lacks in that it doesn't spend much time describing who's in the cockpit, what they do, and how the plane controls work. Overall, it's ""OK"" but I was hoping for more."
3,great video for my 2 year old,My 2 year old son loves this DVD. He doesn't seem to mind its very outdated and that the DVD doesn't even have a menu option on the disc.
5,Harvard Biographical Dictionary,"If you want to know what a composer or proformer means to music, or the contributions they made, this is the book to get. It's the only one you need!"
5,Brilliant,"...classic Tull, lyrically inspired by Anderson's (then)new-found ""country-life""...Contains some of Tull's loveliest melodies and some of their most inspired instrumental passages...an abundance of memorable moments of acoustic/electric guitar interplay and some of B. Barlow's most intricate percussion.Mouse Police Never Sleeps ****Acres Wild ****No Lullaby *****Moths ****Journeyman *****Rover *****One Brown Mouse *****Heavy Horses *****Weathercock ***Living In These Hard Times ***Broadford Bazaar *****5 Stars - Perhaps Their Finest Effort - HIGHLY Recommended"
4,Much Better Than Expected,"Not liking ""Songs From the Wood,"" I bought this album along with ""Broadsword and the Beast"" -- with low expectations. While ""Broadsword and the Beast"" appealed to me just from reading the lyrics, at first I had no interest in this one. But within a week or so it started to grow on me, and now I (sometimes) think it might be better than ""B&B.;""The lively ""Acres Wild,"" the beautiful ""Moths,"" and ""Journeyman"" are the best songs, in my opinion. ""Rover"" is also an interesting and for me somewhat poignant song, clearly not about a dog.It was relief to know there was still some good Tull after ""Too Old to Rock & Roll."""
3,A decent album,"Though it's not on par with Aqualung, Thick As a Brick, Benefit, A Passion Play or Stand Up, Heavy Horses is still a worthy Tull album. Mouse Police Never Sleeps is just plain weird, but still a good track. Acres Wild is enjoyable, nothing more and nothing less. The eight-minute putdown No Lullaby is a great track and one of my favorites, though I also like Moths. Journeyman, Rover and One Brown Mouse are all forgettable, but the title track (which is, of course, about horses) is my favorite on the album with some great flute playing by Ian Anderson. Weathercock, the closer, is forgettable.It's an OK album, but No Lullaby, Moth and Heavy Horses make it a must-buy for Tull fans."
4,"Classic, very under-rated","I think that the reason that this album doesn't get as good reviews from many Amazon.com customers is because it is very close thematically and musically to its superior predecessor Songs from the Wood. Its very unusual for Tull to release two albums in a row that sound similar but that shouldn't take away fromt he fact that this is still great music. And the subject matter isn't as simple as some make it out to be. Old Brown Mouse to my mind is about being trapped, the title track is obviously about ""progress"" and the effect of new technologies on agriculture. Yes, OK, Weathercock is about a weathercock but songs have been written about much more mundane subject matters. And its a tribute to Anderson's songwriting that he can write such great lyrics about something so simple."
1,The Bitter End.,"I remember when this was originally released, and I remember how fast it went to the bargain bin with the other cutouts at the local record store. I remember because I BOUGHT it from the bargain bin (I'd been burned before with ""War Child"", and I'd heard the obnoxious single ""Too Old to Rock and Roll, Too Young to Die"", so I wasn't taking chances). And even though I only paid a buck or two for my copy, I still regretted the purchase. Nowadays the only song on it I ever, ever play is ""Moths"".Enough about me, however. It's worth noting, that although Jethro Tull had been in artistic, critical, and popular decline since just after ""A Passion Play"", this album, ""Heavy Horses"", is the album that knocked it permanently off the top ten. Something to think about."

5,Just as Good As It's Songs From The Woods,"Darker, heavier. More earthy; not quite bluesy, but closer. This album dwells more on the darker side of life. It's not quite Stormwatch, but it's getting there. One of Tull's most amazing collections of songs. It stands out from the later period albums by being both folky, and heavy and dark and light hearted all at once. It has everything for a Tull fan. The arragnements aren't as complex as songs from the wood, but still quite amazing. Buy it and buy it often."
5,Simply fantastic.,"If you notice, most of the one-star ratings here are from the same clown...er, I mean, ""reviewer."" So let's just leave him alone to play with his sad self and revel in this terrific CD together. One of the five best Tull CDs for sure. A wonderfully rustic sound, beautiful song craft and unparalleled musicianship make Heavy Horses a true standout. Anyone with ears can hear that Heavy Horses is further evidence of Anderson's genius."
1,definitive tull,"Tull did NOT die after Thick as a Brick!! they never did. and with Heavy Horses they prove it. The album opens with the first track. The opening guitar riffs are immediately audible. As the song progresses, Ian Anderson uses microphones on his vocals. The next three songs have a slower beat, but a deep blues sound going through them. Heavy Horses is the true coming of age for Jethro Tull in that all the stories in the songs were like a renisance of time. I AM A GREAT TULL FAN AND I A POSSESS ALL OF THEM.... AND THAT'S THE REASON WHY I DARE TO MKE SUCH AN APPRECIATION FOR THIS ""UNIQUE"" ROCK BAND....""I AM TOO OLD TO ROCK N ROLL AND TOO YOUNG TOO DIE""."
4,One of Jethro Tulls classic albums,"This CD came out about 1977 and in my opinion shows Jethro Tull during the period where they did their very best work.I love Jethro Tull when they are using Mandolins, acoustic guitars. and Glockenspiels. I love Tull's acoustic side and there are a few songs that in my opinion are among his very best.The first would be ""Acres Wild"". another would be ""Moths"", moths reminds me of Songs from the Wood, and finally ""One Brown Mouse which has been a personal favorite of mine since the album was released.Heavy Horses is among my top five favorite Tull songs.I love the way Ian Anderson moves from electric guitar and to acoustic and back and forth. These are some of Martin Barre's finest lead runs ever. This could be Martin Barre' finest hour.The Acoustic guitar on Heavy Horses could be his finest was well.This is among Jethro Tull's finest albums ever. No collection is complete without it"
3,good but not great,"Good dvd but the book ""Shadow Divers"" (of which this dvd was based)was much betterr."
1,Total misinformation!,"This is such a travesty. The USA hunted down Geman U-boats before the declaration of war. German U-boats honoured the treaty, but the US did not. So the premise upon which this sorry/sad, pathetic lie of a DVD is worthless. I cannot believe these people are peddling lies to make a profit. Shame on you."
3,Decent video,"I liked the book Shadow Divers and also liked this video, as it put pictures and videos to the story that was in the book. It was interesting to watch the video shot on the sub to help me better visualize the actual diving conditions. This DVD was more Uboat history, topside stuff than I expected with some diving footage here and there. I also found the ""acting"" by the pricipal divers to be a bit scripted... they appeared to do re-enactments of the final identification of the sub and of some of the the dive planning meetings...but these guys are not actors..overall it was an interesting video."
1,.,Occult book. Began reading but got bored and could not keep reading. Ended up donating it to the local bookstore.
5,it is still the best book in differential equations.,"a must-have for numerical workers. still the best classical one in the numerical field. i think Germans really have genius for scientific findings. so many good works are from Germans. i just want to know where i can get this book. i don't know why the publisher doesn't issue it again, or re-publish it. it will have excellent sale, i bet!"
3,disapointed,"Ok, I like to try new things and this was new for me. I was hoping to use them to float on top of soup to give it texture and a little additional flavor. Well, neither happened. So puffy that they melted in the soup almost immediately and created a gummy texture. It may be exactly what it is supposed to be but not at all salty like an oyster cracker either. Overall, I will probably crush them to use as a cracker crumb, but will have to compensate with a lot of seasoning."
5,"Jimmy Wilson's ""Future History""","With Future History, Jimmy Wilson creates an enchanting masterpiece of sound that introduces jazz-fusion to world music to African rhythms. Each track tells its own story and takes you along on its journey, vis a vis the creative collaboration of several notable artists such as Chester Thompson, Dennis Chambers, Scott Ambush, Gerald Veasley, Gary Grainger, George and Geoff Hazelrigg. Wilson blends the styles of Lee Morgan, Clifford Brown and Miles Davis to this unique sound experience of melodic and often sultry songs. The tightness of the playing of all artists mediates us a new sound-experience, never heard before."
5,inspiring,This gave great insight in the spiritual walk of the prophet Ezekiel.. I am learning much which helps me in my walk with the Lord.
1,The movie is stupid just like the movie title states,My god this movie is the worst thing I have ever seen. I'm still recovering crappy movieitis. Im glad I only rented this and didn't pay full price or ahhh buying it save yourself money and heart and look for something else
1,"Not funny, just STUPID","Although I do like some movies that are so stupid that the're funny, this was not one of them. As a favor to my best friend, I watched The Stupids ALL THE WAY THROUGH. It was a real test of friendship. I couldn't get into the dopey plot, and kept trying to escape. I don't understand how someone could think it was a great movie. For most of the time, I was dumbfounded at the gross exaggerations of the truly incompetant characters. The scene where they mistake Lyod for The Lord had potential, but it wasn't presented in an amusing enough way for me. I reccomend banging your head into a wall if you get the urge to watch this movie. If I were Tom Arnold, I would omit this from my resume."
3,"The movie is a little funny, but out of tune with the general taste of the public.","Excellent video quality and good price, but the movie is a little out of tune with the taste of the times. It's for children with an unorthodox sense of humor."
1,What happened to the DVD specs?,"So is it WIDESCREEN or not, already?That is the #1 single most important question when buying a modern DVD. Wake up, Amazon!Update, 2006: Finally snagged this DVD long after the above was written, and luckily it's in widescreen. >Whew!< (So why was Amazon afraid of listing it as so? That's something to brag about, not hide!)"
3,Warning: Unique Humor required,If you find it difficult to see humor in the absurd you will find it difficult to rave about this DVD. A great take-off of 60's suburban living with an added touch of absolute stupidity makes this the type of movie you need to see a few times to pick up all the little additions.Select your company when you view it and be prepared for some great lines!
4,"Truly unique comedy, so stupid it's funny.","This film is really original. It was intended for youyng kids, but this movie is so simple in plot, so unique, so stupid, and frankly, so bad that it's funny. Acting was fine, but could have been better. Very colorful and fun for everyone."
4,Breakthrough comedy! Beyond comparison!,"The only reason why we only gave this movie 4 stars is because they haven't come out with a sequel yet! A twisting and turning plot with superb actors playing hysterically written roles. Easy to follow, yet makes you think. Great for all ages and personalities. If you go for thought-provoking comedies that give you more than laughs, this movie is perfect for you! I've read every book about the Stupids and the movie captures the aura of the family perfectly. Thank the ""Lloyd"" for the Stupids!!!"
3,Great for a break from reality,"I admit, the first time I saw this movie it was about the stupidest thing I ever saw. But it was so stupid in a harmless way that it stuck with me, and the second and third time I saw it I actually found it funny in a childish way. Good for kids."
2,"Unbelievably ""Stupid""","Maybe its me. I just couldn't bear this movie. The best scenes were the ones with Mark Metcalf doing a tongue-in-cheek reprisal of Neidermeyer from Animal House. At lease he provided some eye-candy and a few laughs. As for Tom Arnold- Yeesh. Talk about getting by on personality-and that's stretching it a bit. I swear, I don' know what the matter is with John Landis, but I hope to the ""Lloyd"" he wakes up soon. He has to have a few more good films in him. I pray."
1,One star is as low as amazon.com can go?,"This movie (I use the term lightly) is the worst heap of........stuff I have EVER seen! I went to see the movie with a friend, and ended up leaving 20 minutes into it. I then watched it again when it came on video at the same friends birthday party, watched the whole thing, and was disgusted. I wish there was zero stars"
1,The most horrible movie I've ever seen!,"This movie was SO STUPID! I saw it when I was like 6 or 7 and we left the theater about 35 minutes into the movie! The only reason I saw it was because the trailers looked funny. ""SOMEONE'S STOLEN OUR GARBAGE AGAIN"". Then Tom Arnold chases the garbage truck down the street screaming to give the garbage back. Okay, I can see how that might be funny, but not here because it just gets annoying after awhile. This movie is now available in video stores and I'm here to save you from it. Do yourself a favor and DON'T SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED CASH!"
1,The stupidest movie ever!,"If you feel really stupid, which I did at the time, don't wath this movie cause it's not stupid it's DUMB as can be!!!"
1,The name explains it all,"I sat through the stupid movie for about a half an hour then i got up and kicked myself, took the movie out of the VCR and rushed it back to the video store. I wasted a half an hour on the stupidest movie on earth when i could have been somewhere more interesting, like a sewage disposal plant. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DON'T RENT OR BUY THIS MOVIE FOR ANY REASON WHAT SO EVER. IT IS GARBAGE."
5,The Best Movie Ever,"This movie has been watched by my family time and time again. ... We've seen it atleast 30 times! We don't get together that much so this is a lot!! Although two years isn't a very very long time we all know it by heart. It's a good movie with lots of laughs for the whole family, whether your 5 or 50. Every time we get together, what are we going to watch? The Stupids of course! Nothing else brings us as close as a good viewing of The Stupids!"
4,The Stupids,"You need to have a warped sence of humor to enjoy it, luckily I do. I love this movie and it bombed in theatres. You have to see see it."
5,What a gorgeous voice!,"I love this album. Ann has a voice that never grates on your nerves, it only makes you smile or it comforts. I like the mix of songs on this album as well, some jazz, some folk, some traditional, some more issue oriented. I highly recommend this CD."
2,Cute but Too narrow!!,I saw this shoe on a friend & had to purchase it. I bought my size and I usually wear a 1/2 size smaller in JS shoes but this one runs so narrow it squished my toes & i don't even have fat feet. I would order a bigger size but then it would be too long & leave a gap at the heel. Too bad because they r cute. I have several pairs of JS shoes and they are fine. I have found that some of JS shoes I have tried are too narrow & don't fit. I had to return these but have found plenty of other JS shoes!
5,Fun Sexy Shoe,Love this shoe. It is very sexy and fun. I ordered a half size larger and it still felt a little snug. Toes were cramped a little in the shoe. Other than that the shoe is comfy for the heel height. Shoe stands out and gets noticed.
4,Great adventure in splendid landscape,"This is an adventure novel set in Nineteenth-Century Greece. Along with two British girls, a German student is kidnapped by a legendary bandit who gives the novel its title, ""The King of the Mountains"". The German student falls in love with one of the English girls, but it turns out that their relationship is doomed. Two times they try to escape, but they are caught and he is tortured by the ruthless bandit and his fellows. They are freed after numerous and exotic adventures, and the end is not the typical ""happy end"". Edmond About is a forgotten French writer, with several recommendable books. This is pure entertainment, without any philosophical implications, but it would be worth the reedition of his books. Unlikely as it is, I do recommend that, if you come across one of his books, take the time to indulge yourself in a funny and exotic time reading his novels, which include fantastic (from ""fantasy"") literature and even some proto-science fiction."
5,Dogs will go crazy,My dog is a tiny tot. I first started buying the Bow Wow Beanies when I saw them at Petsmart. My dog really loves them. They're durable. Some of the ones my dog has have lasted for nearly 5 years now. And they are the perfect size for my dog to put in his little mouth. Thank you Ty company for creating something that my dog truly enjoys. He has about 4 different versions and loves them all.
5,Great encapsulated history of Germany,"Turk's book is an outstanding single volume history of Germany from prehistory to 1998. It covers the Immigration Period, the Middle Ages, Early Modern, the 19th Century, the World Wars, and the Reunification of East and West Germany in 1990. Turk gives an appropriate amount of detail, and provides the novice with an outstanding first look at the history of one of the world's most important countries."
5,Appearance of Germanic tribes and overview of Germany to recent times,"Excellent concise overview of the general history of Germany. Easy to follow description of how the early Germanic tribes settled in to area and how they impinged on other formerly more eastern groups, becoming ultimately the Barbarians confronting the Roman border legions."
5,Bravissimo!,"Rebeccasreads highly recommends A VERY GOOD YEAR as a very good memoir, passionately told in a mixture of fluid memories & the disjointed, unraveling of family history. Deeply intuitive, throat-clenching in the sorrow & pain of a wounded heart & a desperate soul, crying out for purpose & courage, even as his mother asks him for one final promise: that he not let her suffer longer than she can bear.We've come a long way in family & grief counseling since Larry Cuocci was seventeen, & had to walk through the valley of his mother's death. While drama & tragedy thunder from every page like an Italian opera, & a young man's sexual yearnings & adventures tickle you into giggles, it is Larry Cuocci's lambent language that illumines his memories of administering to his tortured mom, & grasping life with both hands, & doing it his way.---------------------------------"
5,A Very Good Book,"This book is very well written. Cuocci hits a home run with his very first novel. His use of description is amazing and makes you feel as though you can see what's happening. On the subject of content, this book has everything. Humor, drama, tragedy, romance, eroticism, and life. While reading A Very Good Year, you remember your own experiences with your family, friends, lost loves, and school. I would recomend this book to anyone with a pulse. Pallet Press made a wise decision making this their first release. I few more like it and they could be really big. Read this book."
3,Faulty edition,"If you don't mind occasional typesetting errors such as misplaced apostrophes and commas, this is probably as good an edition of these works as any other. After discovering several such errors in the first 25 pages, I found the stylistic distortions so annoying I had to put the book away."
4,"works fine, but a bit tough to get alignment correctly","I have to say, it's hard to find a digital gauge that is easy to get a reading from. I've tried worse (I returned it) but I kept this one. Not that it is great, but it's good enough to get a repeatable reading once you have the alignment with the tire stem just right."
5,Navigon N100 LOOX,"Awesome product. Small screen but very, very clear. Good software, fast route recalculating. Includes road signs, lanes, speed limit warning. Good voice recognition. Small, cheap unit with a lot of features: MP3 and video player and picture viewer. Also world clock, alarm and 2 video games. Good battery. Lasts for 4-5 hrs."
3,Superb antique!,"Bought this 5 years ago and what a machine!So light, I was able to use velcro to fix it onto the dash - no fiddly or expensive mounts.Pull it off the dashboard and straight into the pocket, easy to set up and few wrong directions.NO map updates are or will available (UK & EU), NO manufacturer support is available.Just done the same with a Motorola 765t (UK & EU), it would appear that I am in exactly the same boat with both manufacturer and mapsoftware market withdrawal.However, the Loox was bought new for $70 and the Motonav for $95 - should I be complaining?"
2,Do NOT Buy - MAP UPDATES NO LONGER AVAIL,"I bought two of these units a year and a half ago for $99 each.They do work as advertised but the map data was out of date when they were new, and no map updates are available from Navigon.Navigon is leaving the US market completely (as of a statement in May 09) so choose your GPS product supplier carefully!"
4,GPS,"It is a nice little GPS for the money. It is a bit too small but gives the best verbal directions of the three GPS's I have, Cobra, Naveman and Garman."
4,"The smallest gps i,ve ever got...","Well i gotta say this GPS works and well i got impressed for the size of the item even when i whent to retail stores to see if i can get a c ase that fits this product i coudnt and i try to compare with the rest of GPS on the market but this one gets all credits just for the size, the only con of this GPS its kind of slow loading the maps and recalculating a new route when you dont follow the commands, and the time to conecct to the satellite takes a little bit longer that others but at the end will work, u can even transfer music files into the memory card that comes with the gps and lisen music while you are going somewhere u can watch pictures, videos and got some games, so i got to say for the price i payed really good stuff to get in your car..."
4,Navigon Loox 100 GPS,"I liked my Navigon loox 100 so much I ended up buying one for my wife and one for my son. My only real complaint is the input keyboard is arranged in alphabetical order instead of the standard keyboard layout which we are all used to.Some times the route is not exactly the same as I would go on my own but nonetheless it gets you there.Support for it is minimal though, I wish there were an easy way to get an external antenna and back up battery. Overall I'm pleased with it."
4,Good so far... not quite go it figured out yet... video would help!,"So far so good, we just got it for Christmas. It is fun, with all sorts of options. A dvd to help figure it all out would help. What we have figured out so far is awsome! The price was right and it is going to be perfect for my husband as he has a tree business and travels all over the surrounding areas doing estimates and work."
3,You get what you pay for...,"I've been playing with the LOOX N100 for awhile now. I agree with the folks that say that it has an amazing amount of features for the price. However, I've run across several issues that you should consider before you buy.Cons:1) It's slow. Really, Really slow.2) The routes it picks are unbelievably awful. I tried fast and optimal as routing options on several routes I drive regularly and it consistently picked routes that are neither fast nor optimal.3) The UI is a bit goofy. I've used several Garmin and TomTom models and the UI on this requires much more fiddling to put destinations in.Pros:1) It's small (I mean really small). It fits in my shirt pocket with lots of room.2) It does have many features.3) US and Canadian maps are preloaded on the Flash Card4) It has a nice set of accessories included.The bottom line, it's an okay intro unit. Give it as a gift or put one in your suitcase for when you travel, but invest a bit more in a unit you use every day."
4,Excellent gps,"I purchased this gps because of the price. And it is excellent for the price. Ive used other gps devices and i would prefer this to many. I really like the size of it and i like the option of the mp3, being able to use it while your using the gps. I do mobile installation and i have to travel around alot. And this thing has made it much easier than looking at a map (which im no good at). I recently have purchased 2 more of these for the people that i work with because they really like the options also. And the POI it has are awesome also, it will show were just a bout everything is."
4,Bitter Sweet,Product as good as advetised if not better.Pocket size was very important to me. Works great.Too bad it took 1 month to ship! Wont order with Amazon ever again. Friend bought same GPS from some othe online source and received it in 4 days at lower shipping cost.
4,Cool gadget!,"Amazing what they can cram into such a small device. This has an MP3 and video player, calculator, games and oh, it is also a GPS device that gives you voice instructions so you do not have to depend on the screen for directions."
4,N100,"Pro - At this price nothing can touch it , Points of interest finder is very accurate, small size & light weight, SD Card support works well, photo viewer, built in mp3 player &video; playerCons - You have to be outside to synch GPS to your exact location,Quite happy with purchase"
1,Horrible customer service,"I purchased this for my son, it won't take a charge, can't locate maps. So we called customer service on 12/25, they said someone would call us back, we have called back 3 times and keep getting the same answer. My son is in the military and was home over Christmas now he is back on base and we are still trying to get someone to take care of this right now it is a piece of junk it doesn't work. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."
5,We love our pocket copilot,It has been everything we expected. Gives great directions. We have tested it in areas we were familiar with and it was right on target. So now we are very comfortable with trusing it when we are in unfamiliar territory. We took it on a recent trip to Texas and it did a great job of getting us everywhere we wanted to go between Houston and Galviston.
1,!!! BEWARE OF THIS PRODUCT !!!,No matter how cute this looks.The company carries no spare parts what so ever.So if your battery dies or your charger damages.This item goes to the Museum.
1,dissatisfied customer,I ordered & received a Pocket LOOX N 100 Series mobile navigator GPS. I cannot get it to work and 2 friends have worked woith it and still it doesn't work. The directions are on a DVD that requires a DVD addition on my computer which i don't have or have any need of for $30 - $40. So I have no way to try to solve the problem. I am going to call the Electronic Direct people and try to either get better instruction material or sent the whole thing back !! Gloria Putney
3,Just need to play,The directions are worthless. Have to have play with it - trial and error. Lettering is very small on screen. So far it's given good results with directions.
1,Think twice before making this purchase,I recently purchased this product which I am very dissatisfied with. I called technical support since the device could not find maps so the technician decided I should install the software to find out that the software is not supported by Macintosh computers. Not to mention I was on hold for over an hour and found technical support to be very rude and unsuccessful. His solution to the problem was it's a new product it just came out. So basically I have a device that I can't use. I hope you find this review helpful because I don't want anyone to go through what I did.
4,Expand the Basic Premise,"The message here is constrained! As a member of the 'comfortable hippy but school-attending' midddle-class"" generation(apparently that's my Social Class???) , reading his Black-White polemic is uncomfortable unless you turn the message into a 'Rich-Poor'division. It is a Universal message but social freedoms then were smaller. Nice book but dated"
3,Skip it,"The book is a great book if you're ""just looking.""If you are at all serious...or might be serious about teaching your child, skip this book and just get the others.I didn't feel this book had in depth information on any of the programs; you would end up buying or borrowing the other books anyway."
2,This book should be completely free,"First 1/2 of the book explains why intelligence is good. Second 1/2 explains how to do it. But the how-to(s) are so general. This book acts like an advertisement material to get you to buy other books so in my opionion, this book should be FREE, instead of wasting your money on it. The title is misleading...it should read ""Why multiply your Baby's Intelligence-& how to buy our other books."""
4,"Great book, but a heads up for working moms...","I felt inspired as I read this book, but I also lay in bed crying softly the night I first opened it. That's because there are a couple of pages about how working mothers are doing their babies a disservice by not staying home with them full time. There's also a jab about how day care isn't good for kids. I'm not saying what's written is true or not true, but if you're a working mom, you'll be hurt by these words. ""I wish you'd never read that stupid book,"" grumbled my husband after watching the tears spill out of my eyes and trying to reassure me that I am a great mom.The next morning, I felt better, and I've started to use the techniques in this book with my beloved two year old boy. This book is extremely opinionated, but I think that's what makes it so interesting. I'm glad I bought it, but I wish it'd been a bit more sensitive to working moms. There are a lot of us and we're doing our best!"
5,Every mother and father need to study this book.,"""The Gentle Revolution"" says it all. If you are someone who really wants to make a profound difference in this world, this book is for you. Hopefully, you are also someone that sees the value in having children (the number is up to you). This is critical information for all of humanity."
5,"All of his ideas are practical, enjoyable and backed by research!","I loved reading this book, the research, the practical ideas and activities to do with you children have all been such a blessings and so much fun. They have definitely strengthened my relationship with my children as I spend more devoted one-on-one time with them and understand the importance of doing so as well as all the enriching things we can do together!"
4,Navarro,"Followed Navarro when they came to town around 1975. I thought there were tremedously talented and their live shows were great. I remember buying the album and being disappointed, though. Was amazed that they ended up playing with Carole King, since I thought they were a different genre. Much more like Dan Fogelberg, Poco, early Eagles, early Jackson Brown. I've wondered what happened to them. It's cool seeing any info on them."
1,How did this happen?,"Navarro backed up Carole King after she met them through Dan Fogelberg, but except for Hardy's flute playing, one wonders why she left stellar players like Danny Kotchmar, Leland Sklar, and Tom Scott for this group. Instrumentally, they are listenable, but certainly not polished. They never inhabit the music the way King did in previous Ode records or the prementioned session players. However, the main problem is the singing (Mark Hallman's ?), often off pitch, nasal, and strained. I usually avoid negative reviews; being a musician myself, bad days or misconceptions of how something should sound happen haunt us all. However, someone should have stopped this record before it hit the press. I can guess that the only reason it is here is for those of us Carole King fans who want to explore some tangents. This cd was expensive and certainly didn't warrant the effort or the money."
5,Perfect for travel,"I bought this case for when I travel, and I have to say it does it job and then some! The interior is soft, and fits the guitar perfectly. I have the Ovation Elite T 1778TX, and I couldnt be happier with my purchase!"
2,Not great,"Weak and powerless... everyone knows this one.The remix of blue is ok but the chorus has some wierd synthed voice during the chorus which makes it sound like a clown singing ""such a perfect colour.."", wierd.There is also a card sleeve version out there with crimes as the backing track to weak and powerless.Both are light on and only for collectors."
4,GREAT FIRST SINGLE...,"I don't think APC could've picked a better first single than, ""Weak and Powerless."" ""Blue,"" makes sense as a B-side release. It is not as heavy as the single, and I believe it leaves APC fans thirsting for more. I hope they plan to release, ""The Outsider,"" as their next single, I think it is more heavier in sound than in, ""Weak and Powerless."" In either case though, Maynard's voice is simply beautiful...APC rocks!!!"
4,This is the first Bernhardt book I have read.......,"Simply, I found this book an easy read. It kept me reading through the night and I thoroughly enjoyed it. A must read."
4,Review of Extreme Justice,Really liked this book. One of Mr. Bernhardt's best. I think this book really makes you stop and think about things before you judge them.
1,Are you in mid-life crisis?,"This was the worst installment of Ben Kincaid I have read. I thoroughly enjoyed the other Ben Books, but this one was more like Bernhadt's diary of his own mid-life crisis. What are we to think? He jumps from one thing to another, can't make up his mind, the ensemble cast isn't allowed to help, and it falls flat on its face. I had the murderer pegged and why the second time he made an appearance in the ""club"". I am very disappointed in this book."
3,Not as good as the previous ones,"The previous books in the series were very good or excellent, but in this installment Bernhardt delivers an average book. It is still easy to read and entertaining, but there are some things missing. The most clear one is that there is no courtroom events in this ""legal thriller"". The other thing I didn't like was that the descriptions of the violence are too gory in some parts.After deciding to leave his legal practice in the last book, Ben Kincaid starts playing the piano in a jazz group and is forced to go back to practice when a body drops on top of him during a performance. The the main suspect is Earl, who owns the place and has established a friendship with Ben, since the murdered victim is a former lover.For those of you that follow the series there are a couple of interesting side stories going on with Jones, Christina and Mrs. Marmelstein.Of course I will continue reading this series; at least the next book to see if the quality picks up again."
4,A Jazzed up Mystery,"Good, easy-to-read mystery that commences when a body is found in a jazz club on the night of the club's anniversary performance. The piano player is a former lawyer who is compelled to take on a case when the jazz club owner is charged with the murder, but did he do it or is he being framed?!? You'll have to read it to find out, but the writing is good, the characters pretty interesting, and there are few (while possible to anticipate given clues left by the author along the way) twists along the way to make it an interesting story."
3,A Horn would help,"One of many B-3ers who are virtually unknown except in some quarters. Hank should have ""borrowed"" a good tenor man to help him out on this disc. Plays in a nice blues ""groove"" and selection of tunes is o.k. but let's be frank, Hank is no Johnny ""Hammond"" Smith who could ""cut"" him any day of the week."
5,Amazing I can see again,"I have been using this product for over a year now and it has cleared up my cataract problem in my left eye. The doctors were quick to recommend the operation but I wanted to find a natural way. I checked and rechecked the ingredients and the safety aspect of this product. Please give it a chance and see if it works for you.If you check around,you can get it cheaper than Amazon."
1,did not work,"Brite Eyes III | 2 vials (5 ml each)Spent $300 on Brite Eyes, Can-C, and Swiss drops. They gave hope, but did not work. After two years, I became 65, got medicare,and two 10K surgeries changed me from unable to drive half blind in whiteout...to seeing beautiful colors and being able to enjoy life again. (Colin)"
3,My experience,"After having doubts about the potency and effectiveness of these eye drops, I switched to Can-C after 14 days. It seems as though, after doing this, I started to notice more change as far as visual performance. But I did an experiment yesterday, that startled me. I decided to alternate between Can-C and Brite Eyes III. After 4-5 drops that day I developed severe redness and irritation, which I had never experienced with either drops before to that degree. This leads to believe that the chemistry between the two drops is somehow incompatible or different. I would also say, from my experience, that the Brite Eyes III drops cause MORE irritation than Can-C.Update March 17 2011: I no longer believe there is any significant difference between Brite Eyes III and Can-C. Even though neither is working for my cataract, I will be using Brite Eyes III in the future because it's less expensive."
1,Didn't work for me.,"I gave this a fair try, it burned my eyes on contact, then turned them red. Customer service said the burning-stinging sensation should diminish after using awhile, used most of 1 vial without positive results.Was hoping it would work."
3,New User,I have not used this product long enough to know if it really works. So far it seems to refresh my eyes if nothing else.
3,Might Do Something,"Been taking couple drops Can C/Brite Eyes once a day for at least 10 years if not 15. I don't know if it's working, I don't go to doctors much.Told I had some cataracts long ago.Vision getting slightly worse. Am 68 yrs old. I am a certified/certifiable skeptic but still 'feel' it's working to some extent; my eyes have never been good.What can I say? There's nothing much else to do. Except lots of C and sunglasses and phytochemicals/lutein/zeanthin/red pepper etc.Mike"
4,Bright Eyes III,I have using Bright Eyes III for years now and they help your eyes feel better and help reduce free radicals around them.
1,I never received this product from Amazon,I never received this product from Amazon. Amazon ignored my e-mail telling them that I did not receive this product. Apparently there is no accountability of who received this product at my address. I now purchase this product from another company even though I am an amazon affiliate with their products on a number of websites.
2,Not enough vibration,This was not worth the money spent. I think if it was a more high powered it would be a lot more satisfying. I bought this for my partner and I and neither one of us really enjoyed it.
1,Truly a disappointment,"This product 100% did not deliver. I was excited to try it out, after all I have heard, and was totally let down. I actually got bored using it! I finally gave up and watched tv instead. Unfortunately, considering the type of product, I am unsure if there is a return policy. Don't waste your money ladies."
1,Smokin!,"After watching Dr. Berman on Oprah, I decided to order this Stimulator. I heard it was hot, but to my surprise, it was Smokin! I mean smoking! When we put the batteries in the control unit, HOT BLACK SMOKE APPEARED!!!!The next day I emailed Amazon and Healthy & Active (distributoer) to let them know the danger, and received no response. I then called the distributor and he informed me that they did not issue refunds. I could only have an exchange. Yea!If you have a fire extinquisher nearby ,order this, and prepare to use it!Personally, I wouldn't order from Healty & Active after this, as no matter what the defect , they will not issue a refund."
2,ouch!,"Great, fast transaction. If I would have known the size, I never would have ordered it. I gave it a ""2"" because I can't use it. If you are larger than me, this is for you. The hook at the head is serious massage."
2,Don't bother buying this,"It really does not do the advertized job, so save your money. It is also VERY LOUD!"
1,More bad than good,"This thing worked twice, once out of the package and once in use and quit. If they spent as much on quality control as the do on advertizing they might have a product."
2,OUCH!,"This product is buried in the drawer, it is painful for me to use. The concept sure is a good one though."
2,Historical Hammer Hilarity or something to that effect!,"Roman Britain? Not quite. A fun foray into Hammer's skewed history? Definitely. This film works on the most basic level. Warrior chicks and Roman villainy with a mad druid for fun. The best acting in this little sizzler comes from that late great charactor actor Patrick Toughton. There are moments when it seems like he is in a completely different film...yes, he's that good. Andrew Keir is not to be missed as the scenery chewing evil centurion. A mediocre effort at historical film making, but a great deal of fun!"
2,Hmmmm...,"Totally fails to live up to any SM expectations you may have.Carita is an absolute honey, though."
5,Billy!!!,The first time I did this DVD I could not finish it. It is really intense.. only for the people who are serious about fitness.
5,Oh my god!!!! Beyond great workout!!,"I am pretty familiar with Billy Blanks workouts. I own three of his other videos and enjoy working out with him. I wanted to switch it up a little and had read the great reviews on this one so I thought I would try it out. The basic workouts are tough but still do-able. Both very good workouts. NOw on the other hand, the advanced workouts on this set are KILLER!! I believe they are 55 minutes long and both times I tried them could only get through about 30-35 minutes of it. And even then I struggled. They are definitely for the advanced person. If you want something fast paced that will have you drenched in sweat and feeling the results that very same day, then give this a shot. It's an awesome workout!!!"
4,A blast from the past,"I bought these DVDs years ago and recenly dusted them off. Wow. I'd forgotten what a great workout Billy Blanks put together. It definitely gets the heart pumping, and all the kicks and punches really workout the arms and legs. I've recommended the Tae Bo workouts to friends and family over the years, but it's probably not for beginners."
2,Inadequate description.,"The description was confusing. I though I was buying an inner tube for a 13"" tire. The G/GR 15 TR13 might be industry identification, but there should be an explanation somewhere in the item description. I tried twice to buy an inner tube from Amazon and got the wrong thing twice. I ended up buying new tubeless tires."
3,"Size was disappointing, but it floats!","I ordered two of these guys for a camping trip out on Lake George. Needed something to lounge in on the water.....They're a good size for kids, not so much for adults. I'm about 5'11"" 180 lbs, and i fit through the hole fine, but if i tried to lay out on the top of it, it would sink under the water. Lame, but i made it work. If you're looking for a lounging/river tube, try this:[...]"
2,not ideal for float or snow,"It is a quality product, but the size is not the best for pool, floating or snow use. When inflated, the full circle is about 25 inches across with the tube itself only 5 inches wide and the middle opening about 15 inches. A good tube for water or snow should be a much fatter tube with a smaller inner opening. I am sure it is fine for use inside a tire. The inside opening is much too large to hold all but the largest adult and the volume of air will not support an adult.For water or snow, get a tube that will be more the shape of a doughnut - this is closer to a bicycle tire tube or a 1920's Model T tire"
2,too small,"These inner tubes are large enough for children, maybe up to age 10. We were disappointed in how small they are."
1,Armalaser cant stay put on Glock 17,"Mounted according to specs this aiming device will not keep accurate placement on a Glock 17. The front of the device has no mounting hardware. It depends soley on the trigger guard to support it from the rear, so when the housing is banged around either from drawing from holtster or slapping into your palm the laser housing goes way off center unsupported at the front. At 10 yards it is off by 2 feet! I would not wish to be caught in a home defense situation with my laser pointing at something my sights tell me I am not going to hit! This device for the Glock 17 to work correctly needs a better mounting system to stop the front of the device from shaking itself off center. My phone call and e-mail to Armalaser went unanswered. So much for customer support. Anyone want to buy a expensive cat toy???? Looking at Crimson Trace right now."
3,armalaser,"Easy to install, and adjust. I do not like how it is activated. The touch strip is problematic. You only get 15 secs of laser. Then you have to touch the sensor strip again. Sometimes it comes on sometimes it does not. It takes a few touches to re-activate the laser."
3,its a laser,The laser did not always work right when it worked it was nice found a crimson trace on sell much better quality
2,Maybe if it had a little better quality,"I biggest complaint was the quality. Looks like a 1980 printer printed sideways and folded it to make a book. The pages fall out VERY easily. However, as far as information goes, it is good if you were doing a report. If you are trying to learn about getting into the business, wrong book. It seems out of date, and for the most part not very helpful. If it told a little more about being better at powder coating, or teaching you anything to even done with a gun, I would have found it more helpful. It's great for a report, nothing else."
4,Nostalgia on CD,"I was happy to find this CD here, as my family had this old LP that my parents purchased when they went to Jamaica in the 70's. The songs are just as I remembered. Even though it sounds like you're listening to the old LP, with that scratchy record sound, to me it only makes the experience more nostalgic. The songs are funny, especially the title song and Shame and Scandal. Mathilda and Wings of a Dove are also favorites."
1,Waste of money,"The sound is so screechy that I could only listen to the CD once through, hoping for at least one good track. It actually was painful to my ears. I cannot listen to it again or pass it on to anyone else; it's that bad."
1,"Great movie, horrible picture quality","I bought this as part of my social studies curriculum for fifth grade. I have the disc on VHS and have shown it for years as part of our Oregon Trail Study. Because it is VHS, we had to watch it on a 19 inch TV. I thought the DVD would be great to show on the Smartboard so the picture would be bigger and students could see it better.Don't buy this one! The picture quality is horrible beyond belief. We will be showing the last half today and using the VHS and tiny TV in the classroom."
1,horrible quality,Horrible video quality...almost non watchable. Story is fine but the quality of the video leaves alot to be desired. We were barely able to watch it because of the video quality.
3,Once and Always a good family movie,"I saw this movie when I was young. I always loved these types of movies growing up and couldn't wait to see it. Yes as some have said, the movie seems dated -- no one was blown up, no one was using drugs, no swearing -- just a good family style movie -- I am still very glad to have it part of my collection. The importance of family is the theme of movie."
1,A really bad copy,"This is a really bad copy of the original. I have a better u.k. video home transfer to DVD, from a video I bought here years ago. I should offer it to the company that made this one to do it again. It would improve on it a lot, even though my tape had tracking problems!My one star rating is for the outer box only, that part was fine!"
3,Seven Alone DVD,"The DVD arrived on time. I've seen the VHS version, and the color is as you would expect in an older movie. However, on the DVD I bought, the color was all washed out looking throughout the movie. This DVD looked like a copy of a copy. The audio was good."
3,Good idea for a story,"This movie sounded as though it would be great, but it was a little short on content and transitions were jumpy."
1,"Great Book, Terrible Movie","I first read the book by Katherine Sager, it was extremely good. She was there, it was about her family. I can't believe how a screenwriter and director can turn a great book into such a poor movie."
1,"yes, leonard, you really are splotch, or you're this","this being a mediocre television hack. an ego ridden actor, and former new yorker who has never risen above that level either live or in media, and never will."
1,Careful who you follow,"I find it hard to believe that this book was even published. It is very poorly written. I am glad that it was given to me for free and I did not have to pay for it. Some of the stories actually make me feel grateful that I never was pulled over by the author. He seems to think that he is above the law. Nevertheless, there are many other, better written books, that deal with a persons Christian walk and their career."
3,"RED TEAM 1, PATRICK MULDOON 0","While I don't feel this movie is as bad as others, I must admit there's a lot of plot holes and the direction is a little tepid considering the subject. Cathy Moriarty, who I think looks like a K-Mart Faye Dunaway, pouts and arches her eyes, but doesn't bring a lot of depth to her character, even when she confronts Muldoon with why the red team is doing what it does. I think Patrick Muldoon does fine as the agent, and continues to be the new stud of Direct to Video movies. Tim Thomerson and Fred Ward are commendable as well, and I didn't even recognize C. Thomas Howell as the bald serial killer.This certainly won't set the standard for serial killer films, but it's entertaining."
1,Worst film ever,"Without a doubt, this is the worst movie I've ever seen. Poorly acted, terrible script, it's not worth watching. It was so irritating, I had to turn the movie off before reaching the end. Don't waste your money or your time."
5,Brass Machine Screws,The advantage of using brass screws is that they are relatively easy to cut cleanly to length. Either use a screw cutter or thread a nut above the point to cut and cut the screw then unscrew the nut over the cut to straighten the thread area back out.The second advantage of brass is that it is relatively corrosion resistant - it will eventually darken but never rust.Brass is strong enough for most home uses - obviously for automotive or aircraft use stainless steel is required.These are well made brass screws at a reasonable price.
5,Great for use with HDDs,Use them to fasten the HDDs to the computer case I built for my NAS from an old Compaq Deskpro case. The head is compatible with the original tool-less HDD attachment design of the case.Also worked great to fasten HDDs to standard cases
1,Not Impressed,"I was very excited when I first found this product because I thought it would really help me with my nursing concept maps but in the end I was very disappointed. The software is very user friendly when it comes to collecting the data, but the actual concept map was a nightmare. Customizing it was a joke. As a student we're required to enter scientific rationale for each intervention which is a lot of typing. This software does not let you resize your text boxes in no way. Therefore, all of my text would end up off the page. It was a mess. I ended up having to take a screenshot, pasting the picture in paint program and then cutting and pasting the text I needed to move. I then pasted that in word and printed my concept map. I've used other Mosby products and know that they could have done better. I think they were just making this product to be able to say that they had it and to make a little money. Don't waste your money."
3,It was ok,"I purchased this to help with a class project. However I found that it did not meet my class specification, because they can vary by each instructors likes, more than care plans. So it did not help me at all. Also I found that my school text book had the exact program available for free on the internet with the web based study guide. so for me it was a redundant product. So to summerize, it was exactly what they claim, it works well, just not what I had hoped for. I have the care plan constructor from the same publisher and it was the best resorce I ever purchased for my nursing education."
5,Great Concept Map Builder,"I feel this program is great for nursing students (myself being one). It quikly builds concept maps and lets you know what information to gather while doing an assesment. Your teacher will be impressed by the professional look. The other reveiw states that it is very difficult to learn how to use this program, however, it took me just a few minutes to be up and running, it's SIMPLE! Anyway I highly recommend it."
2,"Dean Fraser, Jesus Loves Me",I was a bit disappointed with this CD; it was not what i expected & didn't particularly like the music arrangements for the songs
1,Beware the Korean release!!,"Beware of the Korean versions of this DVD. Factory sealed or not, they do not contain most of the special features listed on the back of the case. There are some Korean sellers on eBay who state this calling it a ""misprint"" (I have more choice words for it), but since the US Amazon sellers are importers, they've probably never checked it out and so are probably unaware (I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt). I had to return mine because it didn't have any backstage footage, interviews, day in the life, DVD-ROM stuff, etc. Only came with basic concert footage (no special angles), Rock DJ w/behind the scenes, and Dance with the Devil. I've since spent $50 to get a new DVD player that can handle PAL and multi-regions so I'm going after the original UK version!The 1 star is for the Korean version. For the footage I saw, it's 5 stars, of course."
5,This book is a must have for Daria fans!,"I know that I haven't been a fan as long as many Daria viewers, but I still have an opinion and from what I can tell this book is awesome. The T.V. show is all about Daria, but I always wondered what the other charecters were like, there homes, families etc... But this gave an inside look at others lives, not just Darias. I have watched countless hours of the show, and I learned more about Daria and her chums by reading these books than I think I ever learned by watching the show. If you enjoyed this book you will probably also enjoy Daria Database, which is about Darias website, so she can spread her sarcasm and wit to the whole world. Hope you enjoy.-Lauren-"
4,this is a great book if you enjoy daria,"hey all, i'm a really big daria fan, and i think that the show is so funny. If you also really enjoy it, then you should definetly buy this book. Its full of dark sarcasm, and its just so cool!"
3,slightly disappointed,this was a fun book but it wasnt what i expected granted i dont know exactly what i expected but it wasnt qutie as interesting as i thought it would be i think my favorite parts were the little tidbits of the homework assignmnents the characters had
4,"Really, *really* good.","This book is my prize possession. Along with what other little Daria merchadise I own. A must read for any and all Daria fans, no matter how big or small. Definately my best purchase of the year. :) Buy it NOW."
5,I'll be blunt like Daria - you buy book now,"This is the best book ever imagined, take it from a true Daria fan who has seen every epsiode and owns both the tapes and both the books. Daria's room, quinn's room, profiles, stuff from the show like Push comes to Love, class notes. If yo've ever wanted to be Daria, and i know i have, buy this book. This is slightly better than the Daria Database but they are both must owns for any Daria fan. Hopefully the truth of Daria will spread if you buy this book and join the sane population of earth!"
3,IS IT JUST ME?,"I helped my son read this book for summer reading. Is it just me, or is this ""classic"" a painstaking book to read. Sure the story itself is somewhat interesting, but reading the dialect and trying to understand and define some of the gaelic words was tiresome. I would say after reading some of the words, ""WHAT DID HE SAY?"". Some of the words were not in the glossary at the back of the book. I thought this writer needs to learn to breath, with all the commas used to connect his run on sentences. I was tired by the time I read one sentence. While I was reading this with my son, I was thinking that the school needs to select a better book for any future summer reading! Save your time from this ""classic"" drudge and go out and rent the DVD. It makes the story A LOT more interesting and follows the book to the end. Sorry, perhaps I learned that I'm just not a fan of Mr Stevenson's books."
1,Boooorrrring.....,"This book was so boring...I could not finished reading it. I got as far as the character being on the ship and being very ill and was starting to recover. I just could not take anymore, I was done."
1,I didn't like it at all,This book was very confusing at parts and very hard to understand maybe if Robert Louis Stevenson had spoken in plan english the book would have been a whole lot better. Even though I am sure this is an old book. I hope. :)
1,hmm.....,"I have a few words for this book. Confusing dailaouge, hmm..., hmm... I really liked the movie bettter but who doesn't like movies better than books. I think another reason I didn't like this book is becuase I had to read it while I was sick over thanksgiving, along with reading Bram Stoker's Dracula and H.G. Wells' the isle of dr. maeru,(or something like that) but I guess it's ok if you think about it I just dont really like it"
3,"Good Literature Book, But Hard To Understand","I enjoyed reading this book because of the language, and how it is written. The story itself is also quite interesting, atleast of what I could understand. It is hard to understand the details of the story because of the writer's style (though I like the style, it is hard to understand.) So if you asked me what this story was about, I would be able to answer with the generel story. But if you asked me questions about details, it would be hard for me to answer them.This is a book that I can imagine most adults loving. But for teenagers and younger, they might get bored after a while. Of course I am a kid myself, but I am considered more advanced in reading, and my attention span in classics is more higher than the average child or teenager."
3,A Fun Adventure,"Kidnapped is about a teenaged kid named David Balfour. He leaves his house to look for his fortune. He meets a very interesting man and later discovers it is his uncle. This is a fun book that keeps getting better.I think Robert Louis Stevenson, the author, was telling kids to know who to trust and not to just say hi to a guy and become their friend. He also wanted kids to be brave.The reason I like this book is because it is and exciting story. There is lots of action and fighting. I got interested in the book and couldn't stop reading it."
4,I liked the book,"I liked the book. I liked this book because it had adventures. You didn't know if it would have a happy ending of not until the very last page. The pictures were good, too. This book was cool. And I recommend it to you."
5,Nice bonus,"I bought this book to get our family in the mood for our trip to Edinburgh, Scotland. It surpassed my expectations. Not only is the story a fun read, with lots of historical and geographical references, but the book has 2 bonus features. I quick review of Scottish history, and a discussion on the life and works of Robert Louis Stevenson."
